        "text": "Biden assures campaign donors he can still win election\nBiden assures donors he can still win election\n\nReuters President Biden and the First Lady arriving in New Jersey for a fundraiser\n\nUS President Joe Biden has assured Democrat donors that he can still win November's presidential election against Donald Trump, after a poor debate performance fuelled concern about his candidacy. The president, 81, attended a series of fundraising events in New York and New Jersey on Saturday, and defended his performance in CNN's Presidential Debate. Speaking at one event, Mr Biden admitted, \"I didn\u2019t have a great night, but neither did Trump\u201d on Thursday. \"I promise you we're going to win this election,\" he said. Mr Biden's debate performance was marked by hard-to-follow and shaky answers - raising fresh fears among some Democrats over whether he is the right candidate to contest this high-stakes election. Former Democratic House speaker Nancy Pelosi said Mr Biden's debate performance \u201cwasn\u2019t great\u201d - while his former communications director, Kate Bedingfield, called it \u201creally disappointing\u201d. Voters in the US have regularly shared doubts about Mr Biden's mental and cognitive health, and early polling after the debate shows the number who doubt his ability to serve as president has only grown. On 9 June, a CBS News poll found that 65% of registered voters said that the president does not have the mental fitness to serve as president. The network released a new poll on Sunday that showed that number had jumped to 72% after his poor debate performance.\n\nBiden campaign chairwoman Jennifer O'Malley Dillon said on Saturday, however, that internal post-debate polling showed \"voters' opinions were not changed\". \"It will not be the first time that overblown media narratives have driven temporary dips in the polls,\" she said. While the Biden campaign has acknowledged that the debate had not gone as they had hoped, it has maintained its stance that the president will not step aside for another nominee. Mr Biden has also said he understands the concerns, but pledged to fight harder. New Jersey's Democratic governor Phil Murphy attended the fundraiser in his state alongside Mr Biden and the First Lady - and told Mr Biden that \"we are all with you 1,000%\". Former President Barack Obama, who remains a popular figure in the Democratic party, said on social media that \"bad debate nights happen\". \"This election is still a choice between someone who fought for ordinary folks his entire life and someone who only cares about himself,\" Mr Obama wrote. Hours after the debate, Mr Trump told his supporters that he considered the debate a \"big victory\" for his campaign. \"Joe Biden's problem is not his age,\" the 78-year-old Trump said. \"It's his competence. He's grossly incompetent.\"\n\nName-calling and insults - key moments from Biden and Trump\u2019s debate",

I might not debate as well as I used to,\u201d Biden told a campaign event on Friday. \u201cBut what I do know is how to tell the truth.\u201d",

        "text": "New York Times urges Joe Biden to drop out of presidential race\nThe New York Times\u2019s editorial board has called on Joe Biden to drop out of the 2024 presidential race after a disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump.\n\nBiden\u2019s poor performance sent leading Democrats into a panic on Thursday night, after the US president appeared shaky and at points struggled to finish sentences. It amplified fears about his age and fitness for office that it had been hoped the debate would allay.\n\nShortly after the debate, senior Democrats including the vice-president, Kamala Harris, acknowledged Biden\u2019s \u201cslow start\u201d but emphasised his \u201cstrong finish\u201d, while others privately suggested he should step aside.\n\nIn a move that will add further pressure on the White House, the New York Times editorial board said in an opinion piece on Friday that \u201cthe greatest public service [Biden] can now perform is to announce that he will not continue to run for re-election\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe president appeared on Thursday night as the shadow of a great public servant,\u201d it said. \u201cHe struggled to explain what he would accomplish in a second term. He struggled to respond to [Trump\u2019s] provocations. He struggled to hold [Trump] accountable for his lies, his failures and his chilling plans. More than once, he struggled to make it to the end of a sentence.\u201d\n\n\u201cBiden is not the man he was four years ago,\u201d it added.\n\nEarlier in the day, the leading New York Times columnist Thomas L Friedman called on his \u201cfriend\u201d to step aside. \u201cJoe Biden, a good man and a good president, has no business running for re-election,\u201d he said.\n\nThe former US president Barack Obama defended Biden in a social media post on Friday. \u201cBad debate nights happen,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this election is still a choice between someone who has fought for ordinary folks his entire life and someone who only cares about himself.\u201d\n\nIn a campaign stop in North Carolina on Friday, Biden appeared far more energised and coherent. He acknowledged his widely panned debate performance.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t walk as easily as I used to, I don\u2019t speak as smoothly as I used to, I don\u2019t debate as well as I used to,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBut I know what I do know. I know how to tell the truth.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times has become the first nationally distributed US newspaper to call on Biden to drop out of the race, but other influential publications including the Wall Street Journal, the Financial Times and the Atlantic have published op-eds by their leading columnists calling on Biden to step aside. Journal columnist Peggy Noonan said allowing Biden to continue \u201clooks like elder abuse\u201d.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A New York Times/Sienna poll published this week before the debate found that Trump had a three-point lead over Biden. In the \u201cbattleground\u201d states that are key to winning the White House, Trump is ahead in six out of seven, according to RealClearPolling.",

This is after his \u201cterrible\u201d performance in the first US Presidential debate on Thursday. Though this may not be possible, some people are looking at potential candidates who could replace Biden. One such candidate is Gavin Newsom who is presently the Governor of the state of California, the hi-tech state of the US and home to the Silicon Valley . He is a supporter of Biden and may seem to be the ideal presidential nominee. However, there are several critics who are likely oppose his nomination, if at all Biden is replaced.He is from the city of San Francisco and is a fourth generation San Franciscan. Despite being dyslexic, he managed to finish his schooling and graduated from the Santa Clara University. He has written a book on dyslexia and has donated to create awareness regarding this learning disorder. He is a baseball player too. He was born in 1967.After graduating, he started his business. He has successfully established restaurants and hotels in the state of California. He married Jennifer Siebel after divorcing his first wife. He has four children.He started his political journey in 1996 with the Parking and Traffic Commission in San Francisco. Beginning in 2003, he served as the mayor of the San Francisco for two terms.

Over one-third of all homeless people in the US are in California. There are safety issues with rising crime rates in California. Further, immigration has wreaked havoc in the state. The high taxes have only added to the woes of the people.The US has a dual constitution, one at the federal level and the other at the state level.

        "text": "American media heavyweights tell president: it\u2019s time to quit\nAmid a howling chorus of derision over Joe Biden\u2019s substandard debate performance against Donald Trump, one voice seemed to resonate more powerfully than others.\n\nAt 6.15pm on Friday \u2013 roughly 19 hours after the two presidential candidates left the stage in Atlanta the previous evening \u2013 the verdict of the New York Times\u2019s editorial board dropped online to the newspaper\u2019s subscribers.\n\nThe judgment was devastating. The US president, the board forcefully argued, had presented such an alarming spectacle of aged frailty that the best thing he could now do for the country he had served for more than half a century was to withdraw from the race and allow his Democratic party to choose another candidate.\n\nThe newspaper long venerated as \u201cthe old Grey Lady\u201d of US journalism pointed out that Biden had presented himself as the figure best positioned to defeat the threat to democracy represented by Trump \u2013 and acknowledged that he had successfully done so in 2020.\n\n\u201cBut the greatest public service Mr Biden can now perform is to announce that he will not continue to run for re-election,\u201d it intoned.\n\n\u201cAs it stands, the president is engaged in a reckless gamble. There are Democratic leaders better equipped to present clear, compelling and energetic alternatives to a second Trump presidency \u2026 It\u2019s too big a bet to simply hope Americans will overlook or discount Mr Biden\u2019s age and infirmity that they see with their own eyes.\u201d\n\nThe judgment evoked memories of February 1968, when Walter Cronkite, the magisterial CBS anchor, used his television platform to openly question the US military commitment in Vietnam after the Vietcong launched an offensive that led to guerrillas storming the US embassy compound in Saigon. Watching, President Lyndon Johnson \u2013 another Democratic president, to whom Biden is sometimes compared \u2013 reportedly said: \u201cIf I\u2019ve lost Cronkite, I\u2019ve lost Middle America.\u201d\n\nJust over a month later, Johnson withdrew from that year\u2019s presidential election, announcing he would not seek a second term.\n\nTimes have changed since 1968; media has become more fragmented, with newspapers and, arguably, television less influential. Biden\u2019s response to the editorial \u2013 if he has even seen it \u2013 is unknown.\n\nYet the article echoed equally eviscerating critiques from other weighty and normally friendly sources \u2013 some of them so respected by the president that their views cannot have failed to wound.\n\nSimilarly pleading with Biden to stand down were his favourite columnist, Tom Friedman \u2013 also of the New York Times \u2013 who wrote that he had wept as he watched the debate from Lisbon.\n\nJoe Scarborough, host of MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe \u2013 a programme the president is known to revere \u2013 had an identical message, all the while saying that he \u201cloved\u201d Biden and calling his presidency \u201can unqualified success\u201d.\n\nThe highly respected, and liberal, website the Atlantic published six articles on Friday, all arguing for an end to the Biden candidacy.\n\nView image in fullscreen Joe Biden with Elton John at a Stonewall ceremony in New York on Friday. Photograph: Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe media cacophony reflected shock with the persona that Biden, 81, presented in the debate. Rather than allay nagging voter concerns that he was too old to run \u2013 his campaign\u2019s goal when it pressed for the event \u2013 he seemed to confirm them with his octogenarian mien. He looked infirm and sometimes stuck for words, in contrast to Trump, who \u2013 although just three years younger \u2013 presented a picture of fluent, if mendacious, loquacity.\n\nBiden came out swinging on Friday, appearing much more upbeat at an election rally in North Carolina, admitting that \u201cI don\u2019t debate as well as I used to\u201d but telling a cheering crowd: \u201cI know how to tell the truth \u2026 I know how to do this job. I know \u2013 like millions of Americans know \u2013 when you get knocked down, you get back up.\u201d\n\nMessages of public support poured in from Democratic luminaries including Barack Obama, Bill and Hillary Clinton, vice-president Kamala Harris and Gavin Newsom, the governor of California.\n\nYet the defiantly positive messaging is unlikely to soothe fears that reach into the upper echelons of the Democratic party and even into the White House itself.\n\nSeveral officials in the presidential West Wing were so demoralised by Thursday\u2019s debate that they opted to work from home the following day, Politico reported, expressing their fears on text threads.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Observed Free weekly newsletter Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n\n\u201cWe were all a bit nervous about the debate, but no one thought it was going to be as bad as it was,\u201d one West Wing staffer was quoted as saying. \u201cThe vibes are really bad. People feel demoralised.\u201d\n\nThe acid test may be whether demoralisation extends to Democratic donors \u2013 a sensitive area, given that Trump has recently overtaken Biden in campaign fundraising after lagging for months.\n\nThe early signs are hardly encouraging. The debate triggered waves of panic among Democratic mega-donors in Silicon Valley, where some have emailed and texted each other about how to persuade Jill Biden, the first lady, into talking her husband out of running.\n\nOne tech-industry donor who had planned to host Biden in a fundraiser reportedly cancelled the event because of the debate.\n\nThe negative drumbeat has focused minds on alternatives if Biden does step aside. Two frontrunners would be Harris and Newsom, yet both have vulnerabilities. Harris, who would be the first woman of colour to be a main party\u2019s presidential nominee, is plagued by low approval ratings barely higher than Biden\u2019s, while Newsom\u2019s term as governor of California has drawn criticism over high taxes, surging homelessness and rising housing costs.\n\nOther likely names are Gretchen Whitmer, the governor of Michigan, and Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro, both leaders of key swing states the Democrats need to win to keep the White House. Another possibility \u2013 the Illinois governor, JB Pritzker\u2013 a billionaire heir to the Hyatt hotel chain fortune \u2013 has won attention for his acerbic attacks on Trump.\n\nBut with Biden apparently determined to stand his ground, it remains to be seen if the current discontent is strong enough to transform such speculation into reality.\n\nFor that to happen, drastic action may be required, such as an eminent group of Democratic party elders approaching the president and persuading him to withdraw.\n\nAlternatively, one or more credible candidates could declare a public intention to challenge him \u2013 potentially throwing the power of nomination to delegates at the Democratic national convention in August, an event that was expected to rubber-stamp Biden\u2019s candidacy.\n\nEither scenario would take political will, yet neither is far-fetched, according to seasoned commentators.\n\nIf either come to pass, Biden may end up reflecting that the New York Times\u2019s withering verdict was indeed his Walter Cronkite moment.",

        "text": "American and British voters share deep roots. In 2024, they distrust their own leaders, too\nDARTFORD, England (AP) \u2014 Distrust has settled over the campaign trails in the United States and United Kingdom ahead of July 4 like a soggy summer haze.\n\nOn that day, British voters will choose a new Parliament in an election expected to finish with a Labour government after 14 years under the Conservatives. Americans across the pond, deeply polarized by the rematch between Democratic President Joe Biden and Republican Donald Trump, will mark Independence Day in something resembling unity with barbecues and fireworks ahead of their vote on Nov. 5.\n\nThere\u2019s much to celebrate on the Fourth of July for one of the world\u2019s biggest democracies and the venerable kingdom that gave rise to it, 248 years after they split and set off on slow, troubled journeys toward granting all citizens the right to vote. Both remain rooted in the Magna Carta, the English document signed in 1215. It set in writing the idea that leaders \u2014 including kings, presidents and their governments \u2014 are not above the law. The nations have become close friends and stalwart allies.\n\nThat\u2019s how it started.\n\nAs for how it\u2019s going, the run-up to July 4, 2024 \u2014 Independence Day for one land, Election Day for the other \u2014 offers a snapshot of the stress test facing voters in each country.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just very disheartened, really, because I don\u2019t think any of the parties know what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Dartford, England, resident Jacqueline Richards, 77, said of her country\u2019s election. \u201cBut then looking at yours in America, it\u2019s not that great, is it?\u201d\n\nTrust has taken a beating in both countries\n\nEvery democratic election is, at its core, about who voters trust to run their country so they can go about running their lives.\n\nThis combination of photos shows Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump, left, and President Joe Biden during a presidential debate hosted by CNN, Thursday, June 27, 2024, in Atlanta.

Biden\u2019s halting performance did the opposite of building confidence, even among some of his most loyal supporters. Trump, meanwhile, repeated his lies about the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection and his record as president.\n\nThat\u2019s only the most recent example of why distrust and a sense of resignation dominate the emotional landscape in both countries, according to voters interviewed by The Associated Press in recent weeks. From battleground Wisconsin to bellwether Dartford, England, voters said years of misinformation, scandal and lies have drained them of the sort of optimism or excitement they might once have felt about the right to vote or the future.\n\nIn Britain, 45% said they \u201calmost never\u201d trust governments to put the nation\u2019s interest first, up from 34% in 2019, according to a survey published June 12 by the National Centre for Social Research. The pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine War and the country\u2019s cost-of-living crisis affected living standards and the economy, it reported. Two Tory prime ministers were ousted. Also, there was Boris Johnson, who resigned rather than be thrown out of Parliament over boozy parties at 10 Downing Street when the nation was under COVID-19 lockdown.\n\nA vote to turn the Conservative government out of power is not necessarily a vote for Labour, opposition leader Keir Starmer acknowledged during a May 27 debate. Voters, he said, \u201cstill have questions about us: Has Labour changed enough? Do I trust them with my money, our borders, our security?\u201d\n\nStarmer\u2019s own answer was yes, of course. But British voters told the AP in the weeks before the election that they\u2019re far from sure.\n\n\u201cThey promise and promise and promise and nothing ever changes,\u201d said Shane Bassett, 34, the bar manager at a pub in bellwether Dartford, where the Peasants\u2019 Revolt of 1381 is said to have started. \u201cNo matter who gets in \u2014 if it\u2019s Labour, if it\u2019s Conservative, it\u2019s all the same. They all lie.\u201d\n\nIn the United States, trust has been eroded by deepening political polarization, misinformation and Trump\u2019s lies about Biden\u2019s victory in the 2020 election \u2014 all amplified by social media.\n\nRoughly 2 in 10 Americans say they trust the U.S. government to do what is right \u201cjust about always\u201d or \u201cmost of the time,\u201d according to a recent Pew Research Center survey. About 6 in 10 say they can trust the government \u201conly some of the time\u201d and about 2 in 10 say they can never trust the government to do what\u2019s right.\n\nNearly three-quarters of American adults blame the news media for dividing the nation, according to a 2023 poll by AP-NORC. Families and friends have learned to avoid discussing politics around Thanksgiving tables and other gatherings. In many places, even celebrations of the Fourth of July \u2014 a national holiday when Americans mark the 1776 ratification of the Declaration of Independence from Britain \u2014 fall under this practice of restraint.\n\nIn Racine, Wisconsin, Rebecca Eisel, 48, wondered how the vast United States, home of 262 million eligible voters and the world\u2019s biggest economy, faces a rematch that few Americans wanted.\n\n\u201cHow did our democratic process result in something that the majority of the population doesn\u2019t like?\u201d Eisel, 48, said over a sandwich at the Maple Table restaurant.\n\nThe United States: \u2018The country is struggling\u2019\n\nThe last time Kathleen Barker, 64, was excited about a candidate, it was Ronald Reagan, who went on to serve two terms in the 1980s and exited office by referring to the country as a \u201cshining city on a hill.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was a very real person, very respectful, family-oriented,\u201d she said while walking her dog near the river in Racine. \u201cYou could relate to him. He felt like just that average man.\u201d\n\nNow, she says, the \u201cnasty back-and-forth\u201d between Biden and Trump \u2014 who each insist the other is unfit for office \u2014 suggest neither can be trusted to dig into the major problems facing the United States.\n\n\u201cPeople are poor. The country is struggling. And this is their focus?\u201d she said.\n\nEmmanuel McKinstry speaks about the upcoming election in downtown Racine, Wis.

The economy, he said while waiting in line to hear Trump speak in Racine, is his top issue. The next morning, McKinstry said he\u2019d still vote for Trump \u2014 with reservations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tired of politicians working for themselves and not really getting down and asking people what we really want,\u201d McKinstry said. \u201cWe\u2019re putting you in office. What are you gonna do for us?\u201d\n\nThe last presidential candidate to excite high school teacher Marcus T. West, 49, was Democrat Barack Obama, who went on to serve two terms.\n\n\u201cHe got the importance of educators. He had good intentions,\u201d West said over breakfast at Mrs. Betty\u2019s Kitchen. \u201cHe\u2019s the last person I felt talked like me, talked to me, passed policies that I liked.\u201d\n\nThis year, he said of Biden and Trump, \u201cthey aren\u2019t looking out for us.\u201d\n\nBritain: \u2018Not very optimistic\u2019\n\nBritain\u2019s Prime Minister Rishi Sunak speaks with local children during a visit to a bakery in Golders Green, while on the general election campaign trail, in north west London, Sunday June 30, 2024.

It\u2019s about scandal \u2014 think Johnson and \u201cpartygate\u201d \u2014 and the cost-of-living crisis.\n\nOn May 22, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had good news and a bombshell: Inflation was down to 2.3% for the first time in three years, and he was dissolving Parliament immediately, which started a clock that required an election on July 4.\n\nBut the visuals are what\u2019s remembered about that day. Rain soaked his suited shoulders as Sunak spoke where his predecessors had stood for 275 years, before the iconic black door of No. 10 Downing Street. No one sheltered him with an umbrella. Protesters nearly drowned out his words by playing \u201cThings Can Only Get Better,\u201d a rival Labour campaign song used in the Tony Blair era.\n\n\u201cThings can only get wetter,\u201d led the reports on several news sites.\n\nThat\u2019s what concerns Bassett, the manager at the Wat Tyler Pub, named for a leader of the Peasants\u2019 Revolt that started on that site. You\u2019re not supposed to talk about politics in British pubs, he says \u2014 the counterpart, perhaps, of the American reluctance to stir up trouble on the same topic at parties.\n\nBut Bassett looked around at the empty dining room at lunchtime. There were no customers to offend. So he let it fly.\n\nThe pub\u2019s energy bill last winter jumped from its usual 800 pounds a month (about $1,000) to 1,200 pounds (about $1,500). It has struggled since the Christmas season to bring in customers for a beer. He thinks the owners are likely to sell the place only four years after buying it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not very optimistic.\u201d he said. Thinking of his family members in Canada, Bassett added: \u201cIf I could leave the country, I would.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFernando reported from Racine, Wisconsin.

In the first round on June 30, the far-right National Rally party of Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella came first. Then politicians and voters mobilized to block the National Rally. After a high voter turnout in the July 7 runoff, the far-right did not win the majority that polls had forecast. Instead, a left-wing coalition won the most seats in parliament, Macron's centrists came second and the National Rally came third. But no party won an absolute majority, leaving the final makeup of government uncertain.\n\nRelated coverage\n\n\u2014 French left coalition comes out on top in elections, in shock upset over the far right\n\n\u2014 Here are key takeaways from France's election round 1, where the far right prevails\n\n\u2014 France's far right is gaining momentum for the first time since World War II\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nParliamentary, July 4\n\nThe center-left Labour Party won by a landslide \u2014 its first general election victory in 19 years, since under the leadership of Tony Blair.

The Maduro-backed National Electoral Council said the incumbent leader won, but the political opposition said it had evidence of vote tallies showing a decisive win by Gonz\u00e1lez.

        "text": "US Presidential elections: The challenge before the Democrats\nThe best thing about the American presidential debate last Thursday was that it happened with over four months to go before the elections. If held later, Joe Biden would have appeared even more feeble and Donald Trump would have been just as aggressive \u2013 with the \u201cmorals of an alley cat\u201d, to quote the President of the United States speaking of a former president of the United States.\n\nAmericans don\u2019t deserve this. A troubled world, still desperately dependent on American leadership despite premature declarations of its demise, doesn\u2019t deserve this either.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s sentencing for falsifying hush money payment records is not till July 11, and a string of appeals will, inevitably, ensue. Even when the appeals are done, jail time is not usual in Manhattan for this type of crime by a first-time offender.\n\nBiden firmly believes he is the best person to save the world from Trump. The irony is that he might be right \u2013 unless the Democrats move from Plan Biden to a specific Plan B and make the case for them. In a digital age, four months is more than enough time to produce a star.\n\nLet\u2019s review the Plan B options.\n\nThe presumptive candidate a heartbeat away, Vice President Kamala Harris, polls poorly. Whether it is because of plain old-fashioned misogyny laced with racism, or constant sidelining by the Biden inner-circle, or her own uninspiring track record, together with endless \u201ccheapfake\u201d videos \u2013 done by simply editing out context \u2013 of her laughing, a turnaround of her poor standing in this short time will be hard and she\u2019ll be savaged by Trump and the Trumpists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLooking past Harris is politically hazardous \u2014 it makes the Democratic party look like it doesn\u2019t trust its own leadership while alienating voters who might be upset that a woman of colour is being sidelined. But, given the urgency, other options must be considered.\n\nThe most obvious ones are those with executive governing experience in the states. Leading the pack are Michigan\u2019s Gretchen Whitmer and California\u2019s Gavin Newsom; both are camera-ready and quick on their feet \u2013 ideal for ramping up fast viral campaigns. Whitmer, a supporter of key issues for Democrats and centrists, such as gun control, abortion rights, LGBTQ+ rights, and \u2014 being from a state with a large Arab Muslim population \u2014 has had the chance to practise the delicate balance of reaching out to Muslims while affirming her support for Israel. Her track record is good; her decisiveness during COVID-19 lockdowns signals that she can be tough. Her Midwestern roots will appeal to many in the critical swing states, Michigan being one of them. Her biography includes a relatable \u201cfix the damn roads\u201d campaign, a bizarre \u2013 thwarted \u2014 plot to kidnap her and a \u201cBig Gretch\u201d rap song that could serve as a fine campaign anthem. Newsom, on the other hand, like all politicians, has his defenders and detractors, but could be attacked for reasons that include being out of touch or for the homelessness crisis in California\u2019s major cities. His biography is complicated: Once married to the current fianc\u00e9e of Trump\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr, he has admitted to an extramarital affair with a friend\u2019s wife. Whitmer, as a woman, would make a more palatable candidate, who leapfrogs over Harris. On the other hand, Newsom\u2019s advantage is an old-fashioned one in American politics: A Y chromosome.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t bother with the other governors whose names are being floated, such as Pennsylvania\u2019s Josh Shapiro, Kentucky\u2019s Andy Beshear, or Illinois\u2019 J B Pritzker. It would take too long to elevate them to the national stage, road-test them and make them Trump-proof.\n\nThen, there are those from within the Biden cabinet. Secretary of Transportation, Pete Buttigieg, is young, articulate, and gay \u2013 a vastly different package from Biden. He was a presidential aspirant in the last election. Secretary of Commerce, Gina Raimondo, is another possibility \u2013 competent, respected, a woman, and former state governor. But both have obstacles. They are from the Biden team and leapfrogging over Harris would be awkward, to say the least. Transportation and commerce secretaries have critically important jobs, and even when they do well, these are not the most exciting of records to package and sell in a few months. Most significantly, neither would help with Black voters concerned about the sidelining of Harris.\n\nThis brings us to two names from the past who share a common attribute: Both are former White House occupants. I speak, of course, of Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama. Clinton\u2019s return might be a counterfactual fantasy of what might have been, had the 2016 election shocker not happened. But she\u2019s past the time in her life when she has the desire or energy to jump back into politics and would face too much opposition even within the Democratic party. Michelle Obama is a name that has come up as she commands a wide following. Even Trump has mentioned her, and Republican senator Ted Cruz is convinced she will be the Biden replacement. She can defuse the resentment that many would feel over Harris\u2019s sidelining. Besides not having any relevant experience other than residency in the White House, she has shown no interest in doing her husband\u2019s job. While intriguing and potentially a game-changer, Obama may be a bridge too far.\n\nBut, before we get to any of these possibilities, there is another White House occupant who is critical to opening the door to any of these considerations. This is the one person who can persuade Biden to get off the stage. She helped him do so when the debate ended. Perhaps, she can do it again. With four months to go, there is plenty of time to elevate a fresh new candidate.\n\nMy pick: Michigan\u2019s Big Gretch. She\u2019s smart and tough. She is exactly the kind of woman that Trump has gone after in his life. It\u2019s time such a woman goes after him.\n\nThe writer is Dean of Global Business at The Fletcher School at Tufts University",

        "text": "U.S. presidential election 2024: Growing clamour for Biden to step down; he says here to stay to defeat Trump\nFollowing a disastrous performance at the debate stage in Atlanta, there is a growing clamour within the ruling Democratic party and the mainstream American media for President Joe Biden to step down from the presidential race.\n\nHowever, the 81-year-old President and his campaign have asserted that he is not giving up and is determined to successfully run for the November 5th presidential elections.\n\n\u201cMr. Biden is the nominee (of the Democratic party. No switching of the nominee,\u201d campaign leadership has asserted.\n\nMr. Biden, the 46th President of the United States, has won the Democratic presidential primary.\n\nAs of June 29, he had 3,894 delegates as against 1,975 delegates required to win the nomination of the party. These delegates would meet in Chicago from August 19 to 22 to formally nominate the winner of the primaries to run for the November 5 presidential elections.\n\nMr. Biden, seeking a second term in the White House, stumbled and fumbled during the televised presidential debate with his predecessor Donald Trump on Thursday night in Atlanta, setting off alarm bells among top Democrats about whether he can stay atop the gruelling months ahead of the elections on November 5.\n\nThe 78-year-old Mr. Trump, who is the presumptive Republican Party candidate for the presidential election, clashed right from the start with Biden and by the end of the 90 minutes debate, gave enough fodder for serious editorials and opinions as well as memes on social media.\n\nOver the last 50 hours after the first presidential debate in Atlanta on Thursday night, wherein his performance was seen far below par against his rival Mr. Trump, multiple media outlets, including The New York Times and his own party supporters and key decision makers, are calling him to step down from the race.\n\n\u201cDropping out is Mr. Biden\u2019s most patriotic option,\u201d The Atlantic said Saturday.\n\n\u201cTo serve his country, President Biden should leave the race,\u201d The New York Times editorial board wrote Following the debate.\n\nThe New York Times wrote, \u201cThat is no longer a sufficient rationale for why Mr. Biden should be the Democratic nominee this year.\u201d Similar messages are coming from inside the party as well.\n\nHowever, his inner circle is standing by the side of Mr. Biden.\n\nA post-debate poll says that 10% of the independent voters have moved towards Mr. Biden after the debate, a point that is being made by his team.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my best debate ever as Barack (Obama) pointed out. I understand the concern after the debate,\" Mr. Biden told his fundraisers in New Jersey. \"I get it. I didn't have a great night, but I\u2019m going to be fighting harder,\u201d he said.\n\n\"Research during the debate shows us converting more undecided voters than Trump did, in large part because of his conduct on January 6,\" Mr. Biden said. He argued Mr. Trump\u2019s lies were the biggest takeaway: \u201cPeople remember the bad things during his presidency.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have a great night but neither did he,\" he said again of Mr. Trump.\n\nSeveral prominent columnists \u2014 Paul Krugman, Tom Friedman, Nicholas Kristof, Jonathan Alter, and David Ignatius \u2014 argued that the chance of a diminished Mr. Biden losing to Mr. Trump is too high to risk.",

        "text": "Election 2024 post-debate: The road ahead for Biden and Trump\nFor Democrats, Thursday night's debate was a nightmare. President Joe Biden's performance at the Atlanta face-off, viewed by more than 50 million, sparked a panic, with a flurry of editorials and commentators pleading with the 81-year-old Biden to drop out.\n\nNew York Times reporter Katie Rogers, who covers the Biden White House, said, \"There is an acknowledgment writ large that the president performed badly. It went poorly. It was a bad night. But there have not been any big sit-downs, big soul-searching sessions. It's just right back to work.\"\n\nRogers, who wrote a book that deeply examines the influence of first lady Jill Biden, said she has not picked up on any efforts inside the Biden family questioning whether this run for reelection is worth it. In fact, Rogers says calls for Biden to step aside will likely only strengthen the first family's resolve for him to stay in: \"The naysayers are key to understanding him. I mean, they drive him. They help reinforce his idea of who he is. You can't overcome an obstacle if people don't put it in your way, or life doesn't put it in your way.\"\n\nFor Biden, barreling through a thicket of pain \u2013 be it personal tragedy or political humiliation \u2013 is nothing new. After more than a half-century in Washington, he has endured setbacks time and again, including when many Democrats and pundits counted him out in 2020. Biden, of course, ultimately prevailed in that race, defeating then-President Donald Trump.\n\nThis past week made clear that winning a rematch will be no easy feat. Trump is on the march in the polls, despite making false statements, which he did at the debate regarding January 6th, abortion, and his own record.\n\nFaiz Shakir, a top adviser to Bernie Sanders, who managed Sander's 2020 campaign when the Vermont senator ran against Biden for the Democratic nomination, said that, following the debate, Democrats are more alarmed about Trump's possible return to the White House, despite coming out publicly in support of President Biden.\n\n\"I think there's some degree of trepidation behind the scenes as people line up behind him,\" Shakir said. \"Obviously, President Biden has to make a decision about whether he stays in this race. And I hope he does. And I hope that if he does, he has to make some changes.\"\n\nThink Mr. Biden will be replaced at the Democratic National Convention this August in Chicago? Think again. The president already has won almost all the roughly 4,000 pledged delegates. Unless he withdraws, they are expected to vote for him on the first ballot.\n\nSo, is anybody making credible moves behind the scenes for a possible shake-up of the Democratic ticket? \"No,\" said Shakir. \"There's a lot of people looking ahead four years. At this point, this party is his. This nomination is his. And he's, really, the sole decider of the future course of where he's gonna go.\"\n\nNew Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu supported Nikki Haley in the Republican primary, but has since endorsed Trump. He said, \"For a while, you could make the argument that, you know, 'Boy, it was tough defending Donald Trump as a Republican, that we were gonna get behind him.' But today, it's a much harder thing for Democrats to explain why they would stick to Joe Biden.\"\n\nTrump has his critics, and his challenges \u2013 including a sentencing date in July for his criminal conviction in New York. But Sununu said the Republican Party is largely with him.\n\nAnd after this past week's debate, they are feeling better than ever.\n\nSununu also doesn't believe there is a Democrat who would make a play against Biden: \"No. No one, if they're smart. I think they're gonna have that kind of realization that as much as they want a new candidate, they had their shot. They missed it. They gotta ride it out, hope that there's a second debate, hope that he does much better, hope that Trump creates a bigger problem for himself.\"\n\nThe day after the debate, with his wife at his side, the president sought to reassure Democrats in North Carolina: \"Folks, I don't walk as easy as I used to. I don't speak as smoothly as I used to. I don't debate as well as I used to. But I know what I do know: I know how to tell the truth. I know right from wrong. And I know how to do this job. I know how to get things done. And I know like millions of Americans know: When you get knocked down, you get back up.\"\n\nThe Times' Katie Rogers says for now the Bidens seem convinced he has one more comeback left \u2026 in what is very likely the last campaign of his long career. \"Both of them, when they feel the odds are rising against him, that is when they get feistier,\" she said. \"They view obstacles as part of his long life in politics, almost associate it with his political brand. But age is not an obstacle, it's a reckoner, and it is a different problem than the ones he has faced before.\"\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nStory produced by Mark Hudspeth.

Biden is heading to the Camp David presidential retreat where he was expected to spend the rest of the weekend. Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPresident Joe Biden will be joined by members of his family at Camp David over the weekend for a long-planned photo shoot, multiple sources said, on the heels of a poor debate performance against former President Donald Trump that has thrust his campaign in turmoil and set off widespread panic among Democrats.\n\nWhile the family is expected to discuss the events of the past week, multiple senior advisers insisted to CNN on Saturday that the gathering was not aimed at discussing whether the president would remain in the race \u2014 even as he is facing immense pressure from some to drop out. Publicly, White House and campaign aides \u2014 and the president himself \u2014 have all maintained since Thursday\u2019s debate that there is no question that Biden will remain in the race.\n\n\u201cNothing I\u2019ve heard from senior White House and campaign staffers today makes me think they\u2019re considering anything other than continuing to campaign hard,\u201d Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, a Biden campaign co-chair and longtime friend of the president\u2019s, told CNN.\n\nStill, it is well known that Biden\u2019s family, more so than his closest advisers, holds significant influence over decisions regarding the president\u2019s political future. Despite senior Biden advisers stressing that the weekend gathering was not intended to discuss whether Biden will seek a second term, nothing would preclude the family from ultimately having such conversations in private.\n\nThe family is expected to be photographed by renowned photographer Annie Leibovitz, one senior Biden official told CNN. Biden\u2019s children and grandchildren are expected to be at the presidential retreat, a separate source familiar with the gathering said.\n\nThe same source said it was planned going back as far as March. Another senior Biden official said in the aftermath of the debate, the president has not wavered and believes he is the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump in November.",

        "text": "US Election: What If Biden Leaves 2024 Presidential Race\nUS President Joe Biden's woeful performance in the presidential debate against challenger Donald Trump has re-ignited questions about what would happen should the veteran Democrat step down as party flagbearer at the last minute.\n\nSuch a high-risk political U-turn would be unprecedented in modern American election history. Here's a look into how replacing the 81-year-old could be possible.\n\n- If a candidate leaves -\n\nTo designate a formal nominee, delegates from all 50 states attend their party's summer nominating convention to officially anoint a candidate based on primary voting.\n\nBiden overwhelmingly won the primary votes, and the party's roughly 3,900 delegates heading to the convention in Chicago this August are beholden to him.\n\nIf Biden exits, the delegates would have to find a replacement. That would mean bringing US politics back to the old days, when party bosses jostled to pick a nominee through deal-making in smoke-filled back rooms and endless rounds of voting.\n\nOn March 31, 1968 president Lyndon Johnson made the shock announcement in the middle of the Vietnam War that he would not seek reelection.\n\nThe move turned that year's convention, also in Chicago, into a political crisis with protesters in the street and left-leaning delegates angry at the pro-war stance of party-picked candidate Hubert Humphrey.\n\nFollowing the debacle, states more widely embraced the primary process and conventions have become well-oiled affairs, whose outcomes have been known in advance since they are determined by the primaries.\n\nIf a candidate must step down after being officially nominated at the convention, a party's formal governing body, either the Democratic National Committee or Republican National Committee, would nominate a new candidate in an extraordinary session.\n\n- Who might fill in? -\n\nSo far, the Democrats have circled the wagons around their designated nominee, at least when speaking on the record, with former president Barack Obama coming out to defend Biden.\n\nWhen asked about Biden potentially stepping aside, campaign communication director Michael Tyler told reporters aboard Air Force One there were \"no conversations about that whatsoever.\"\n\nA natural -- but not automatic -- pick to take Biden's place would be his running mate on the 2020 ticket, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nSent in Thursday night to put out the fire after the Democratic president's lackluster performance, the 59-year-old conceded Biden had been \"slow to start\" the debate but had \"finished strong.\"\n\nOtherwise, any of a number of strong Democratic politicians -- Governors Gavin Newsom of California, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania are mentioned -- might be called on.\n\nMeanwhile, could a strong third-party hopeful emerge? So far, no independent candidate is posing any danger to America's dominant two-party system.\n\nIn 1992, Texas billionaire Ross Perot, running as an independent, managed to win nearly 19 percent of the popular vote.\n\nBut in the end, because of the vagaries of the American electoral system, he did not receive a single one of the votes that matter most: those of the 538 members of the Electoral College that ultimately decide the winner.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Historian who predicted 9 of the last 10 election results says Democrats shouldn't drop Joe Biden\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Allan Lichtman, the historian who has correctly forecast the results of nine out of the 10 most recent presidential elections argued on Saturday that replacing President Joe Biden could cost Democrats the 2024 election.\n\nLichtman, a professor at American University, rejected the growing chorus of political pundits and Democratic activists who have called on Biden, 81, to bow out of the presidential race after his disastrous debate performance last week against former President Donald Trump. The pivotal moment brought fresh questions about Biden\u2019s age and ability to serve a second term.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge mistake. They're not doctors. They don't know whether Biden is physically capable of carrying out a second term or not,\u201d Lichtman said during an interview with CNN of calls to replace Biden. \u201cThis is all foolhardy nonsense.\u201d\n\nLichtman has correctly predicted the outcome of almost every election over the last half century, except for the race in 2000, using a series of 13 historical factors or \u201ckeys.\u201d\n\nThe system includes four factors based on politics, seven on performance, and two on candidate personality. Lichtman said the incumbent party would need to lose six of those actors, or \u201ckeys,\u201d to lose the White House.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nThe keys range from whether a candidate is an incumbent president to the state of the economy and the presence of third-party hopefuls.\n\nDebate performance, however, is not one of the factors that determines the outcome of an election, he argued. Lichtman pointed to historical examples, including the 1984 election in which former President Ronald Reagan swept 49 states despite poor debate performances and concerns over his age.\n\nWhen pressed about whether the questions surrounding Biden\u2019s age and mental acuity are \u201cfundamentally different\u201d than his metrics as president, Lichtman doubled down.\n\n\u201cDebate performances can be overcome,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the first sign of adversity the spineless Democrats want to throw under the bus, their own incumbent president. My goodness.\u201d\n\nLichtman has not made his final prediction for who will win the 2024 presidential election.",

        "text": "Tuning into the narratives in the American election\nIn this year of successive world-wide elections, the issues in the United States presidential election, to be held in November, have not yet aroused considerable scrutiny. Yet, 1892 was the last time an immediately former President was contesting with his successor incumbent. The election\u2019s main issues will cover immigration, democracy, foreign policy, abortion and Donald Trump\u2019s indictments. In the current deeply polarised setting, opinion polls show that supporters of the former Republican President, Donald Trump, will do so again; and the same applies to the current Democrat President, Joe Biden\u2019s followers.\n\nThe economy, the perception\n\nThe economy has become an important issue in the November presidential elections; normally, the economy should be decisive since history shows that a sitting President with a strong economy gets re-elected. But different economic indicators are travelling in different directions; some are positive, with low unemployment and a rising stock market, but negatives also appear in the high interest rate which affects everyone using credit. The rate of inflation has not come down, nor have prices even after the COVID-19 pandemic, though incomes have gone up.\n\nThe good aspects of the economy take time to impact the public, unlike the negatives. Mr. Biden is considered a better economic manager than Mr. Trump, and 65% of the electorate appears to think that the economy is in good or very good shape. But whether this will be a steady trend or only a momentary reaction cannot be anticipated, remembering that Mr. Trump\u2019s pre-pandemic economy was quite strong. Most voters are not focusing on the economy \u2014 at least for now.\n\nPolarisation in American society covers social issues as well as the urban versus rural/semi-urban divide. The latter since the 1990s are Republican, the former Democrat and the two are sharply divided. De-industrialisation, deregulation since the 1990s, job losses, and agribusiness suffering have affected the rural areas deeply and magnified these differences. President Biden has tried to rectify this but has not received any credit for his initiatives because the rural and semi-urban areas remain feeling discriminated against. Mr. Biden knows very well that the rural vote needs more attention, but it will take decades for such a divide to be properly rectified.\n\nIn industry, employment levels are good but inequality is still grave. A great deal of current investment goes into hi-tech, high-skilled, high-salaried jobs, but many of these projects are long term in gestation. Republicans tend to avoid involvement in the economy, but, here too, Republican opinion seems to be changing. Mr. Trump has been talking of a 10% across-the-board tariff but this will add to inflation and increase each family\u2019s expenditure by $1,500-$2,500 every year.\n\nThe approaches to trade\n\nIn trade policy, there are clear differences between the Biden and Trump approaches. Mr. Trump is no believer in multilateralism, and during his tenure used tariffs to leverage better bilateral trade deals. Mr. Biden retained some of these tariffs but lowered others for Europeans, for example, to block Chinese steel and aluminium in order to limit the high carbon used to make these in China. The age of neo-liberal fundamentalist Democratic policies seems to be over, while on the Republican side, the debate continues; the libertarians are very powerful but there are nascent signs of rebellion against them.\n\nRegarding the unions, in some regions blue-collar workers have become newly unionised at a time when the recent trend has seen the union movement decreasing. Unions have been helpful socially and assisted the Democrats, but with de-industrialisation, their place in society has been taken over by evangelical movements and gun lobbies, which attract strong support among rural communities. Support for unions appears still high among the American public, and Mr. Biden was the first U.S. President ever to join a picket line, but this factor is not likely to help his campaign for a second term.\n\nFactors now present\n\nFour danger signals seem key to the future of American democracy: extreme partisan polarisation; social questions of \u2018belonging\u2019, such as anti-immigration and racism; high economic inequality and executive aggrandisement, namely, when a leader expands his/her power beyond the customary checks and balances. Some experts feel that all four factors are now present in the United States.\n\nMr. Trump was unwelcoming to immigrants, and by the end of his term, public support for immigration had risen. Mr. Trump\u2019s policies on immigration will prove inflationary since he wishes to deport thousands of low-wage earners. Mr. Biden is more welcoming, but perhaps more so than the American public at large wanted, and he mismanaged border issues.\n\nThis is now a contentious issue even among Democrats and will be another factor going into the elections. Mr. Biden tried to outflank the Republicans with a bipartisan bill that the Democrats would not normally have agreed to, but Mr. Trump gave Mr. Biden a lifeline by opposing it; Mr. Biden will now lose fewer votes as a result.\n\nOpinion polls suggest that Democrat support among minorities such as African-Americans, Latinos and Asian-Americans is slipping. But all these polls have a small sample size and the shifts could be small, and more marked among men than women. Nevertheless, they give cause for the Democratic candidate in a few key States to be worried.\n\nKrishnan Srinivasan is a former Foreign Secretary",

        "text": "Nevada adds proposed constitutional amendment for abortion rights to 2024 ballot\nRENO, Nev. (AP) \u2014 A ballot question to enshrine Nevada\u2019s abortion rights in the state constitution has met all of the requirements to appear in front of voters in November, the Nevada Secretary of State\u2019s office announced Friday, and Democrats across the nation hope similar measures mobilize supporters on Election Day.\n\nThey have made abortion rights a central message since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 court decision establishing a nationwide right to abortion. Nevada voters in 1990 made abortion legal up to 24 weeks, but a state law is easier to pass and more vulnerable to change than the constitutional protection organizers are seeking.\n\nVoters must approve the ballot question in both 2024 and 2026 to amend the state constitution.\n\nCounty officials from across the Nevada approved the required number of signatures from Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom, the political action committee that organized the ballot initiative. The Nevada Secretary of State\u2019s office certified those totals, according to a memo sent to organizers Friday.\n\nSeveral Republican-controlled states have tightened abortion restrictions or imposed outright bans. Fourteen states ban abortions at all stages of pregnancy, while 25 allow abortions up to 24 weeks or later, with limited exceptions.\n\nMost states with Democratic legislatures have laws or executive orders protecting access. Voters in California, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana, Ohio and Vermont have sided with abortion rights supporters on ballot measures. Supporters of abortion rights have qualified measures for ballots in Colorado and South Dakota, and Nevada was among about nine other states where signature drives have been underway.\n\nREAD MORE: \u2018They want us to be scared\u2019: Anti-abortion activists target ballot measure organizers in Arkansas\n\nNevadans for Reproductive Freedom announced last month that they submitted more than 200,000 signatures. Proponents needed 102,000 valid signatures by June 26 to qualify for the ballot, and just under 128,000 were deemed valid.\n\nThe organization held a news conference Monday, which marked two years after the Dobbs v. Jackson decision overturned the national right to abortion, to promote the petition and unveil a letter signed by medical professionals in support.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t take anything for granted in a post-Dobbs world and that\u2019s why we are really doubling down on the protections we have in statute currently,\u201d said Lindsey Harmon, the group\u2019s president.\n\nAnti-abortion group Nevada Right to Life spokesperson Krystal Minera-Alvis said in a statement that the proposed amendment is \u201cbased on lies\u201d and is funded by \u201cout of state dark money,\u201d and described the ballot question as misleading, given that abortion rights are already codified in state law.\n\n\u201cAs an organization, we stand firm on the fact that this amendment is unsafe and dangerous for women of all ages,\u201d Minera-Alvis said in the statement.\n\nSeparately, Republican organizers said they submitted nearly 180,000 signatures to get a measure on November\u2019s ballot that would amend the state constitution to require that voters show photo identification at the polls, said David Gibbs, of political action committee Repair the Vote. If counties verify just over 100,000 signatures, voters would also have to pass the amendment in both 2024 and 2026 for it to take effect.",

US President turns to family, decision likely soon\nUS President Joe Biden had already scheduled time at Camp David for a family photo session on Sunday and Monday, contradicting an NBC News report suggesting discussions about his re-election campaign.\n\nAP reported citing White House officials on the condition of anonymity.\n\nBefore heading to Camp David on Saturday night, Biden was observed speaking on the phone with historian Jon Meacham.\n\nEarlier in the day, Biden and US First Lady Jill Biden attended a private campaign event in East Hampton, New York. The event, held at the residence of Avram Glazer, a co-owner of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, was closed to the media.\n\n\u201cWe can waste time comparing debate nights,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut you know what? It\u2019s more meaningful to compare presidencies.\u201d\n\nAP reported that Democratic donors in New York, Southern California, and Silicon Valley are privately voicing concerns about the future of President Biden's campaign following the debate, which has sparked widespread discussion and criticism online. Clips and memes from the debate have circulated widely, fueling public pressure for Biden to reconsider his candidacy.\n\nThey have begun discussing potential replacements, with a shortlist that includes Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, California Governor Gavin Newsom, and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nAs of Friday, there was no organized effort to pressure Biden into stepping aside, and some believed such a move would be impractical given the logistical hurdles of replacing a presumptive nominee just four months before Election Day.\n\nHowever, some donors indicated they planned to suspend their personal contributions temporarily. They acknowledged that receipts from Biden's weekend fundraiser were likely to remain robust because tickets had been sold and paid for prior to the debate.\n\nMany donors, party strategists, and members of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) are expressing both publicly and privately their desire for 81-year-old Biden to step aside, allowing the party to select a younger replacement at the Democratic National Convention in August. Despite these sentiments, Biden's closest allies maintain that he is still well-positioned to compete against Republican Donald Trump. They have not indicated any intention to pressure him to end his campaign.\n\nAFP reported that many stakeholders are now eagerly awaiting the release of the first major post-debate public opinion polls to gauge their next moves.\n\nEarly polling from CNN and 538/Ipsos immediately after the debate indicated that most viewers believed Trump performed better than Biden.

        "text": "Exclusive - Iran\u2019s US ballot station plan sees mixed results as some venues cancel voting events\nIran\u2019s plan to run absentee voter ballot stations in more than 30 U.S. cities for the first round of its presidential election had mixed results, a VOA investigation has found.\n\nInformation obtained and reviewed by VOA indicates that absentee voting events were held on Friday in at least half of the 33 venues displayed on a list of U.S. ballot stations published online by Iran's interests section office in Washington.\n\nBut the voting operation also suffered setbacks, with three of the listed venues canceling their voting events on Friday under pressure from Iranian American activists and protesters who oppose Iran\u2019s authoritarian Islamist rulers.\n\nOrganizers responded to two of the cancelations by updating the list of ballot stations to show last-minute switches to alternate venues.\n\nThe most prominent absentee voting site was Washington\u2019s Iranian interests section office, where a VOA Persian reporter observed about 35 people arriving to vote in a nine-hour period. Dozens of protesters shouted at the voters, accusing them of supporting an Iranian government that oppresses its people and legitimizing a sham election whose only candidates were loyalists of Iran\u2019s supreme leader.\n\nIn addition to Washington, VOA assessed that voting events were held at 18 sites on Iran\u2019s list of ballot stations. VOA obtained verbal confirmations in Friday phone calls to staff at 12 hotels on the list and vetted activists\u2019 images of the other six venues.\n\nThe 12 hotels included four Hilton properties in Lincoln, Nebraska, Long Island City, New York, Milpitas, California and Seattle, Washington; four Hyatt properties in Dallas, Texas, Fort Lee, New Jersey, Houston, Texas and Raleigh, North Carolina; two Marriott properties in Cleveland, Ohio and Mesa, Arizona; an IHG property in Chicago, Illinois; and the Savai Hotel in Overland Park, Kansas.\n\nSocial media videos indicated that two additional hotels hosted ballot stations despite hotel staff saying they had no knowledge of such activity.\n\nMultiple videos posted to X and sent to VOA by activists showed an entrance to one hotel, Hilton\u2019s DoubleTree in Gaithersburg, Maryland, where several Iranians could be seen standing outside and exiting the building as activists in the parking lot verbally berated them for participating in the election.\n\nA DoubleTree manager contacted by phone and informed of the videos maintained that the hotel was not being used as a ballot station.\n\nThe other hotel, Choice Hotel's Comfort Inn Sandy Springs in Atlanta, Georgia, appeared in a mobile phone video posted to X. An activist holding the phone walked into the hotel and entered a function room serving as a ballot station, interacting with the Iranian attendants before apparently being told to leave.\n\nA hotel staff member who answered the phone said he had \u201cno idea\u201d about the event.\n\nTwo other ballot station venues were seen in social media images showing that voting activity had taken place for several hours before being canceled in the face of protests. Organizers relocated one of the venues to a third ballot station.\n\nActivists outside the Ontario Airport Hotel & Conference Center in California were seen shouting at several Iranians who showed up to vote on Friday morning before the hotel canceled the event at around 11 a.m. local time. A staff member who answered the phone confirmed the cancelation, which prompted the venue\u2019s removal from an updated version of Iran's ballot station list.\n\nAnother group of activists outside The Congregational Church of Weston in Massachusetts were seen in a video posted on X. The activists jeered at a car leaving the site and cheered when a police officer told them that organizers were preparing to shut down the ballot station.\n\nAn updated Friday version of Iran\u2019s ballot station list showed the Weston venue was replaced by an Islamic center in Milford, Massachusetts. A photo posted to X showed an Iranian voting notice on the center's front door, indicating that it also was used as a ballot station.\n\nA sixth venue where voting activity appeared on social media was an office building of Easterns Automotive Group, a used car dealership in Sterling, Virginia. A video posted to X showed a man walking up to the entrance as a guard opened the door, which displayed an Iranian election notice.\n\nA review of Friday updates to Iran\u2019s ballot station list showed the Sterling venue replaced the nearby Hilton McLean Tysons Corner hotel, which had been listed earlier as a ballot station before its station number was removed from the list. Siamak Aram, an activist with the National Solidarity Group for Iran, told VOA that his group had contacted the hotel to urge cancelation of the voting event. A hotel staffer who answered the phone confirmed that the event was not on Friday's schedule.\n\nIran\u2019s ballot station list contained another three hotels and an event hall for which there were no confirmations of voting activity from staff contacted by phone and no social media images of such events found by VOA. They included a Hilton hotel in Rancho Cordova, California, an IHG hotel in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the Biltmore Hotel Oklahoma and The Rose Court event hall in Tampa, Florida.\n\nThe remaining nine venues on the ballot station list included four Islamic centers in Detroit, Michigan, Manassas, Virginia, Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Portland, Oregon. The others were a landscaping company in Buffalo, New York, and four Virginia and Maryland locations that a mobile voting station was slated to visit during the day.\n\nThe addresses of all the U.S. ballot stations besides Iran\u2019s interests section office only began to appear online as voting began on Friday morning. In almost all cases, the addresses were displayed as street names and numbers, without the venues being named. The entire list was deleted on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThe Islamic Republic and its agents understand that the regime is deeply unpopular in the Iranian diaspora, whose members are channeling the voices of their Iran-based compatriots calling for regime change,\u201d said Jason Brodsky, policy director of U.S. advocacy group United Against Nuclear Iran, in a VOA interview.\n\n\u201cThe regime and its agents fear the Iranian diaspora because of its organizing power, so they want to keep this U.S. voting activity as quiet as possible to prevent embarrassing situations in which their fellow Iranians denounce the election for the sham that it is,\u201d Brodsky said.\n\nSoran Khateri of VOA\u2019s Persian Service contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Historian who predicted 9 of the last 10 election results says Democrats shouldn't drop Joe Biden\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Allan Lichtman, the historian who has correctly forecast the results of nine out of the 10 most recent presidential elections argued on Saturday that replacing President Joe Biden could cost Democrats the 2024 election.\n\nLichtman, a professor at American University, rejected the growing chorus of political pundits and Democratic activists who have called on Biden, 81, to bow out of the presidential race after his disastrous debate performance last week against former President Donald Trump. The pivotal moment brought fresh questions about Biden\u2019s age and ability to serve a second term.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge mistake. They're not doctors. They don't know whether Biden is physically capable of carrying out a second term or not,\u201d Lichtman said during an interview with CNN of calls to replace Biden. \u201cThis is all foolhardy nonsense.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nLichtman has correctly predicted the outcome of almost every election over the last half century, except for the race in 2000, using a series of 13 historical factors or \u201ckeys.\u201d\n\nDr. Allan Lichtman\n\nThe system includes four factors based on politics, seven on performance, and two on candidate personality. Lichtman said the incumbent party would need to lose six of those actors, or \u201ckeys,\u201d to lose the White House.\n\nThe keys range from whether a candidate is an incumbent president to the state of the economy and the presence of third-party hopefuls.\n\nDebate performance, however, is not one of the factors that determines the outcome of an election, he argued. Lichtman pointed to historical examples, including the 1984 election in which former President Ronald Reagan swept 49 states despite poor debate performances and concerns over his age.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhen pressed about whether the questions surrounding Biden\u2019s age and mental acuity are \u201cfundamentally different\u201d than his metrics as president, Lichtman doubled down.\n\n\u201cDebate performances can be overcome,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the first sign of adversity the spineless Democrats want to throw under the bus, their own incumbent president. My goodness.\u201d\n\nLichtman has not made his final prediction for who will win the 2024 presidential election.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Historian who predicts elections says Democrats shouldn't drop Biden",

The first CNN presidential debate between the incumbent Joe Biden, the 46th president, and his challenger, Donald Trump, the 45th president, that was a rematch for both as the two faced each other twice in 2020, is done and dusted.\n\nPost-debate, it is an advantage for Trump, largely on account of the self-goal of a bumbling and faltering Biden, who was not in his nettle during the debate. A consensus is building even among staunch Democrat supporters that, after the horrifying performance in the debate, this may curtail the chances for Biden to be the next president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBad Debate Nights Happen\n\nTwo former American presidents, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, have rallied behind the beleaguered Biden. While Clinton vouched that Biden has given America \u201csolid leadership,\" Obama has firmly stood behind Biden, publicly defending and backing him despite his performance. Later in the Thursday debate, Obama took to the social media platform \u201cX\u201d (formerly Twitter) to say, \u201cBad Debate Nights Happen\u201d.\n\nHe added further:\n\n\u201cThis election is still a choice between someone who has fought for ordinary folks his entire life and someone who only cares about himself. Between someone who tells the truth, who knows right from wrong and will give to the American people straight, and someone who lies through his teeth for his own benefit. Last night did not change that, and it\u2019s why so much is at stake in November.\u201d\n\nObama has a point or two here: One, by all accounts, Biden in his first term has acquitted him well as the president ticking most boxes right. Obama knows from his personal experience that bad debate nights do indeed happen. In the run-up to his re-election as president in 2012, with barely one month to go until the election, Obama himself had a disastrous debate first with his opponent Mitt Romney, after which he reassessed and changed his debate strategy and indeed emerged victorious in the presidential election.\n\nClamour for the Scalp\n\nAfter his inferior performance in the debate on Thursday, there is a growing clamour for Biden to step aside from the presidential race. An uncharitable op-ed piece by the New York Times Editorial Board titled \u201cTo serve his country, Biden should leave the race\u201d described Biden as appearing to be \u201cthe shadow of a great public servant\u201d in the debate, during which he repeatedly misspoke and struggled to complete answers. The unsigned opinion piece from the editorial board added further:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMr. Biden has been an admirable president. Under his leadership, the nation has prospered and begun to address a range of long-term challenges, and the wounds ripped open by Mr. Trump have begun to heal. But the greatest public service Mr. Biden can now perform is to announce that he will not continue to run for re-election.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post editorial board in the Opinion Piece titled \u201cHow Biden and the Democrats should think through what to do now\u201d just fell short of asking Biden to step aside but nonetheless had the following advice for the President:\n\n\u201cIf President Biden had weekend plans, he should cancel them in favour of some soul-searching. His calamitous debate performance on Thursday raises legitimate questions about whether he\u2019s up for another four years in the world\u2019s toughest job. It\u2019s incumbent on this incumbent to determine, in conversation with family and aides, whether continuing to seek re-election is in the best interests of the country.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBritish weekly The Economist elaborating that over 90 agonising minutes, Biden was befuddled and incoherent\u2014too infirm, frankly, to cope with another four years in the world\u2019s hardest job\u2014has suggested that \u201cJoe Biden should now give away to an alternative candidate.\n\nBiden Strikes Back\n\nBiden campaign spokesperson, Michael Tyler, has dismissed the idea that the president would consider stepping aside. And Biden, in a post-debate rally on Friday in North Carolina, while admitting \u201che is not a young man to state the obvious,\u201d added emphatically:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t debate as well as I used to, but I know what I do know: I know how to tell the truth.\u201d \u201cI know right from wrong. And I know how to do this job.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiden has vowed to stay in the race, whereas Trump has hailed his \u2018big victory\u2019 in the debate. It raises too many substantive questions: One, what was the debate all about, and two, can Biden strike back to win the November 5 election from here?\n\nWhat the Debate Was All About\n\nIronically, for the most part, the ninety-minute debate did not reveal any new things about what Biden and Trump thought about or how they would handle the key domestic and international issues the US faces including but not limited to inflation and economy, foreign policy in general and raging wars in particular, the major immigration issue facing America or reproductive rights of women and the key issue of abortion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the most part, Thursday night\u2019s debate revealed nothing new about what Biden and Trump thought on major issues such as the economy, immigration, foreign policy, and reproductive rights. The truth beckons that the debate was one of lobbying personal attacks and criticising the past record of each other.\n\nA Balance Scorecard of Biden\n\nThe balanced scorecard for Biden\u2019s term (both domestic and transnational) has been praiseworthy. He inherited and steadied a country mired in a chaotic Covid-19 pandemic from Trump, along with a nation reeling in the aftermath of the January 6, 2021, insurrection. He has handled the economy, employment, and inflation well. Indubitably, more people are working in America than at any other point in time, and the country has given a leg up to \u2018Make in America Production\u2019 and moved on ambitious climate goals of cutting emissions in half by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050. Speaking of foreign policy, his biggest success has been rallying NATO and the European Commission admirably well after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nCan Biden Still Win the Race?\n\nTrump, after being evasive about accepting the election result if it went against him, roared in his closing remarks in the debate, \u201cWe\u2019re a failing nation, but it\u2019s not going to be failing anymore. We\u2019re going to make it great again.\"\n\nBiden might have had an otherwise disastrous debate, but he was to the point in his closing remarks. He emphasised noteworthy progress in his term after the debacle left by Trump. He summarised some of his signature policies. He was emphatic that there would be a raise in taxes on anyone earning under $400,000 a year, and he committed to continuing his work to reduce health care and childcare costs and give families financial breathing room. It was clear that his war to bring down inflation would continue.\n\nNonetheless, on debate night, Biden fumbled and faltered, and it was clearly advantaging Trump despite his staying put with many falsehoods.\n\nAnd the key issue remains: \u201cCan President Biden win the race from here?\"\n\nI say difficult, but possible. Before the debate, opinion polls were evenly matched with a slender lead for Trump. The debate has damaged Biden\u2019s chances. He looked faded and jaded. He has singularly failed to convince voters that he is not too frail and old to lead America to greatness for one more term,\n\nBut these are still early days. This year\u2019s debate was early in the day. He still has more than four months by his side to turn the tide. A lot can happen over 128 days. Even a month is too long in politics.\n\nBut the moot question remains: despite time being on his side, it is up to him to convince the voters that Thursday was one odd bad night out and that he has the physical and mental prowess to lead America and the world for four more years. Admittedly, Biden is 81. But age is just a number. And his competitor, Donald Trump, at 78, is old as well, and his record of the first term of the presidency is not so flattering.\n\nAnd if Obama can rise from the ashes after a disastrous first debate in 2012, so can Biden in 2024. If he succeeds, history will be rewritten. If he fails, it will be Trump all the way and an unpredictable time for America and the world.\n\nThe author is a multi-disciplinary thought leader with Action Bias and an India based impact consultant.

        "text": "Ex CIA Insider Issues Urgent Warning of Economic and Social Turmoil Post-2024 Election\nPredicting significant market crashes and civil unrest, former CIA advisor Jim Rickards advises urgent preparatory measures as the U.S. approaches polarizing election\n\nNEW YORK, June 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- With the 2024 Presidential Election approaching, Paradigm Press Group's Jim Rickards, a highly respected economist and former advisor to the CIA, Pentagon, and White House, is sounding the alarm on an impending national crisis. Known for his accurate predictions of the 2008 Great Recession, Trump\u2019s 2016 Election win, and the Covid Crisis of 2020, Rickards now warns of social and economic chaos that could follow this election.\n\nRickards-New\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Rickards\n\n\u201cThe 2024 election is poised to be one of the most tumultuous events in American history,\u201d Rickards states. \u201cWe are facing the potential for a 50% market crash, the collapse of the US dollar, and widespread civil unrest. The time to prepare is now.\u201d\n\nKey points of Ex CIA Rickards\u2019 urgent warning:\n\nElection-Triggered Market Crash: Rickards foresees a massive stock market downturn, with potential losses exceeding 50%, and a significant devaluation of the US dollar. Civil Unrest and Possible Martial Law: His forecast includes a high probability of violent riots and social disorder, possibly leading to the imposition of martial law and temporary suspension of civil rights. Immediate Action Required: Rickards outlines five essential steps Americans should take immediately to protect their wealth and personal safety. Proven Track Record: With a history of accurate predictions, Rickards\u2019 insights and strategies are based on extensive experience and expertise.\n\nThe 2024 Presidential Election could be the \u2018Tipping Point\u2019\n\nRickards outlines several reasons as to why the stock market could fall at any moment following the election.\n\nElection Chaos and Legal Challenges : Rickards suggests that the 2024 Presidential Election could be similar to the 2000 election but on a much larger scale. This could lead to a prolonged period of uncertainty, causing investors to panic and sell off their stocks.\n\nRefusal to Transfer Power and Civil Unrest: If Trump wins the election, but is prevented from taking office by the current establishment, Rickards predicts widespread civil unrest to break out. Violent protests, clashes with law enforcement, and potential declarations of martial law could create tremendous fear and uncertainty, driving a massive sell-off in the stock market.\n\nCollapse of the US Dollar : Rickards foresees a scenario where the political instability resulting from election chaos and civil unrest leads to a loss of confidence in the US dollar. As investors seek safer assets, there could be a rapid devaluation of the dollar, causing a fight from dollar-denominated assets, including stocks.\n\nIncreasing Inflation: We still have an inflation problem. The combination of government spending, policies, and political instability could lead to hyperinflation. Rickards warns that inflation could become \u201c1000 times worse\u201d than current levels, eroding the value of investments and causing a stock market crash as investors try to preserve their wealth.\n\nPolicy and Governance Issues: Rickards notes that we can not continue to sustain the current administration\u2019s policies on immigration and spending. If things remain, we could be headed towards economic instability. For instance, massive government spending could lead to a fiscal crisis, where the government is unable to service its debt, causing a loss of confidence in the financial system.\n\nHistorical Comparison: Rickards being one who successfully predicted the 2008 financial crisis, implies that similar systemic risks are present today. He suggests that underlying economic weaknesses, combined with political instability, could lead to a sudden market downturn similar to the collapse experienced in 2008.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAbout Jim Rickards Jim Rickards is a distinguished lawyer, economist, and investment banker with over five decades of experience on Wall Street and in international finance. He has advised the highest levels of government, including: the CIA, Pentagon, and White House. Jim has also authored several best-selling books on economic policy and financial markets. Known for his accurate predictions of the 2008 Great Recession, Trump\u2019s 2016 Election win, and the Covid Crisis of 2020, Rickards now warns of catastrophic consequences that could follow this election. Take the necessary next steps, NOW Jim has prepared an entire brief on how every American can prepare themselves for the potential economic and social destruction following the upcoming election.

        "text": "What is the fallout if the supreme court grants Trump presidential immunity?\nWith four more cases to be decided, the supreme court is planned to issue its decision on Donald Trump\u2019s presidential immunity claim on Monday.\n\nIn Donald Trump v the United States, the former president is seeking absolute immunity from criminal prosecution over his attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election and his role in the January 6 Capitol Hill insurrection.\n\nAccording to Trump, who has been indicted by the justice department\u2019s special counsel Jack Smith on four counts related to his 2020 election overturn efforts, presidents should be immune from federal prosecution.\n\nThe case, which was presented before the conservative-majority supreme court on 25 April, was the last that was argued this term. According to critics, the supreme court\u2019s decision to hold on to this case until early July while having issued decisions on other major cases in recent weeks is \u201cintentional\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe delay that has occurred here is intentional, and it is destructive of our democratic process,\u201d James Sample, a constitutional law professor at Hofstra University, told Salon.\n\nEchoing similar sentiments, Laurence Tribe, a constitutional law professor emeritus at Harvard University, told Salon:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious that the court has deliberately delayed everything \u2026 It could easily have issued a ruling much sooner \u2026 It could have taken the case in December when the special counsel asked it to be heard directly, or they could have declined to take the case after the court of appeals quite comprehensively rejected Trump\u2019s appeal, so the trial could be over by now.\u201d\n\nRegardless of what the supreme court\u2019s decision on the case is, its handling of the case\u2019s timeline has significantly decreased the chances of Trump standing trial before the 2024 presidential elections in November.\n\nAcross all four of his criminal cases, Trump has been trying to delay the trials\u2019 start dates. Thus far, he has only been convicted in one of his cases that involved hush-money payments to adult film actor Stormy Daniels in attempts to influence the 2016 presidential election.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Trump on Trial Free newsletter Stay up to date on all of Donald Trump\u2019s trials.

Both Trump\u2019s lawyer and the justice department\u2019s lawyer have agreed that there were certain private acts that presidents are not immune from.\n\nDuring oral arguments in April, conservative justice and Trump appointee Brett Kavanaugh appeared to suggest that refusing immunity would affect future presidents.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to stop, it\u2019s going to cycle back and be used against the current president and the next president and the next president after that,\u201d Kavanaugh said.\n\nMeanwhile, liberal justice and Biden appointee Ketanji Brown Jackson said that immunity would encourage future presidents to commit crimes while in office.\n\n\u201cOnce we say \u2018no criminal liability, Mr President. You can do whatever you want,\u2019 I\u2019m worried we would have a worse problem than the problem of the president feeling constrained to follow the law while he\u2019s in office,\u201d Jackson said.",

        "text": "What does the Supreme Court immunity ruling mean for Trump? 6 questions answered\nSoon after the court\u2019s decision was released, the former president declared in all caps on his social media network, \u201cBig win for our Constitution and democracy. Proud to be an American.\u201d\n\nWhile the lower court has the job of working out the specific parameters of the high court\u2019s decision, one thing is clear: For Trump, the ruling is a victory. He and his legal team have sought to dismiss or delay the four ongoing criminal cases against him. And this latest Supreme Court ruling makes it hard to see how the federal 2020 election case could go to trial before the next Election Day.\n\nThe court\u2019s three liberal justices dissented. Monday\u2019s decision \u201creshapes the institution of the Presidency\u201d and could lead to stark, long-term consequences for American democracy, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote.\n\nIn a historic decision, the Supreme Court ruled Monday that former presidents have at least some immunity from criminal prosecution for \u201cofficial acts\u201d in office, no matter their \u201cpolitics, policy, or party,\u201d but stipulated that that protection doesn\u2019t cover everything.\n\nWhat happens to Trump\u2019s federal criminal charges, especially if he is reelected? Here are six quick questions about the court\u2019s ruling.\n\nIn short, what does the ruling say?\n\nThe heart of Trump v. United States was a legally untested question that has not come before the high court until now: whether a president could be immune from criminal prosecution for official acts while in office.\n\n\u201cThe president enjoys no immunity for his unofficial acts, and not everything the President does is official. The President is not above the law,\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority opinion.\n\nBut, Roberts added, \u201cthe system of separated powers designed by the Framers has always demanded an energetic, independent Executive. The President therefore may not be prosecuted for exercising his core constitutional powers, and he is entitled, at a minimum, to a presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official acts.\u201d\n\nThe court\u2019s three liberal justices argued that making a president immune from prosecution makes him \u201ca king above the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet the President violate the law, let him exploit the trappings of his office for personal gain, let him use his official power for evil ends,\u201d Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote. \u201cBecause if he knew that he may one day face liability for breaking the law, he might not be as bold and fearless as we would like him to be. That is the majority\u2019s message today.\u201d\n\nHow does the court define an official vs. unofficial act?\n\nChief Justice Roberts laid out three different categories of presidential acts:\n\nOfficial acts that rely on core constitutional powers, for which \u201cimmunity must be absolute\u201d\n\nthat rely on core constitutional powers, for which \u201cimmunity must be absolute\u201d Official actions \u201cwithin the outer perimeter\u201d of official responsibility, that require at least presumed immunity\n\n\u201cwithin the outer perimeter\u201d of official responsibility, that require at least presumed immunity Unofficial actions while in office, from which the president has no immunity\n\nRoberts said some actions, such as those involving the attorney general or Department of Justice, fall into the first category. They \u201care readily categorized in light of the nature of the President\u2019s official relationship to the office held by that individual,\u201d and therefore fall under absolute immunity.\n\nOther interactions, Roberts wrote, get more complicated.\n\nThese include Trump\u2019s conversations with then-Vice President Mike Pence, who was tasked with overseeing the certification of electoral college votes on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n\u201cThe indictment\u2019s allegations that Trump attempted to pressure the Vice President to take particular acts in connection with his role at the certification proceeding thus involve official conduct, and Trump is at least presumptively immune from prosecution for such conduct,\u201d Roberts wrote.\n\n\u201cThe question then becomes whether that presumption of immunity is rebutted under the circumstances,\u201d he added.\n\nRoberts acknowledged the broad range of other conduct in Trump\u2019s indictment, including false claims of voter fraud, the alleged fake elector scheme, and his actions on Jan. 6.\n\nThe court asked the lower district court to determine whether these actions \u2014which involved state governments, private actors and the public \u2014 were taken in an official or unofficial capacity.\n\n\u201cDetermining whose characterization may be correct, and with respect to which conduct, requires a fact-specific analysis of the indictment\u2019s extensive and interrelated allegations,\u201d Roberts wrote.\n\nWhat did the court say about Trump and the government\u2019s arguments?\n\n\u201cTrump asserts a far broader immunity than the limited one the Court recognizes,\u201d Roberts wrote.\n\nTrump\u2019s legal team, citing the impeachment judgment clause, had argued that the federal government\u2019s case against him should be dismissed because conviction by the U.S. Senate is a \u201cnecessary step\u201d before criminal prosecution. Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives but acquitted in his Jan. 6 impeachment trial.\n\nBut Roberts wrote that the clause doesn\u2019t cover what happens if a president is never impeached. Nor does it or other historical documents address or \u201ceven consider\u201d how immunity from prosecution applies to a former president.\n\nAt the same time, the Justice Department \u201cfor its part takes a similarly broad view, contending that the President enjoys no immunity from criminal prosecution for any action.\n\n\u201cIt is the Government\u2019s burden to rebut the presumption of immunity,\u201d Roberts wrote.\n\nOne of the biggest takeaways with Monday\u2019s ruling is that the justices are \u201csomething of a mixed bag\u201d on the question of presidential immunity, said Steve Vladeck, an expert on federal courts and professor at the Georgetown University Law Center. In the court\u2019s ruling, the majority said sometimes yes, sometimes no.\n\nAnother important moment: The court weighed in on whether prosecutors, in trying a former president, can cite official acts \u2014 things for which the president could not otherwise be prosecuted \u2014 as evidence. The majority said no.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s actually a really big deal, even if it\u2019s a little technical, and it\u2019s going to throw a pretty big wrench not just into the prosecution of former President Trump, but future efforts to hold presidents liable if they commit crimes while in office,\u201d Vladeck said.\n\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett split from her fellow conservative justices on this point.\n\nIn a separate concurrence, Barrett wrote that \u201cthe Constitution does not require blinding juries to the circumstances surrounding conduct for which Presidents can be held liable\u201d and that rules around evidence already exist to handle concerns about prejudicing the jury on a case-by-case basis.\n\nShe broadly agreed with the majority that former presidents enjoyed some level of immunity for their official acts while in office. But she wrote that \u201ca President facing prosecution may challenge the constitutionality of a criminal statute as applied to official acts alleged in the indictment. If that challenge fails, however, he must stand trial.\u201d\n\nWhat was the dissent?\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision fell along ideological lines. Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson all dissented from the conservative majority.\n\nSotomayor wrote in her dissent that the court\u2019s decision to grant former president criminal immunity \u201creshapes the institution of the Presidency.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt makes a mockery of the principle, foundational to our Constitution and system of Government, that no man is above the law,\u201d she added.\n\nSotomayor wrote that the president, under the majority\u2019s reasoning, will now be protected from prosecution for a variety of actions while in office.\n\nThe justice raised a few examples. \u201cOrders the Navy\u2019s Seal Team 6 to assassinate a political rival? Immune. Organizes a military dissenting coup to hold onto power? Immune. Takes a bribe in exchange for a pardon? Immune. Immune, immune, immune.\u201d\n\nEven if these \u201cnightmare scenarios\u201d never pan out, \u201cthe damage has been done,\u201d Sotomayor wrote.\n\n\u201cThe relationship between the President and the people he serves has shifted irrevocably. In every use of official power, the President is now a king above the law.\u201d\n\nWhat does this ruling mean for the Jan. 6 case?\n\n\n\nWatch the video in the player above.\n\nBecause the Supreme Court did not determine which of Trump\u2019s actions were unofficial acts, special counsel Jack Smith is going to have to wait for the lower district court to weigh in, which takes some time, said Chris Geidner, a longtime Supreme Court journalist who publishes the Law Dork newsletter.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have briefings, you\u2019re going to have probably hearings, before we even get to a point that Jack Smith knows what\u2019s allowed to go forward to trial,\u201d he told PBS News\u2019 William Brangham on Monday.\n\nIf Smith had received clear definitions from the high court, he could make faster determinations about what can stay in the federal indictment, Geidner added.\n\nThe likelihood of this case going to trial before Americans go to the polls in November is slim. Before Monday\u2019s landmark decision, experts criticized the Supreme Court for slow walking Trump\u2019s immunity bid.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan, who presides over the case involving Trump\u2019s alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election, will set the timing for the trial. She\u2019s previously promised to give Trump\u2019s legal team about 90 days to prepare.\n\nChutkan rejected Trump\u2019s immunity claim in December, ruling that the U.S. presidency \u201cdoes not confer a lifelong \u2018get-out-of-jail-free\u2019 pass.\u201d\n\nWhat does this ruling mean for the presidency and possible future cases?\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision tilts even more power toward the office of the presidency, whether the president is a Democrat or a Republican,\u201d Vladeck said.\n\nIt also tilts power \u201caway from Congress, which passes criminal statutes that presumably apply to the president, tilts that power away from courts, which are the ones that are supposedly holding presidents liable when they engage in wrongdoing,\u201d Vladeck said.\n\nMost importantly, Vladeck said, it tilts power away from the people, because the only option left for accountability for presidents becomes impeachment, \u201c a process that is weak enough on its own, and hard to imagine being especially effective in a late second term of a presidency.\u201d\n\nPBS News\u2019 Kyle Midura reported for this story.",

        "text": "What to know about the Supreme Court immunity ruling in Trump\u2019s 2020 election interference case\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling Monday in former President Donald Trump\u2019s 2020 election interference case makes it all but certain that the Republican will not face trial in Washington ahead of the November election.\n\nThe Supreme Court did not dismiss \u2014 as Trump had wanted \u2014 the indictment alleging he illegally schemed to cling to power after he lost to President Joe Biden. But the ruling still amounts to a major victory for the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, whose legal strategy has focused on delaying the proceedings until after the election.\n\nThe timing of the trial matters because if Trump defeats Biden, he could appoint an attorney general who would seek the dismissal of this case and the other federal prosecutions he faces. Or Trump could potentially order a pardon for himself.\n\nTrump posted in all capital letters on his social media network shortly after the decision was released: \u201cBIG WIN FOR OUR CONSTITUTION AND DEMOCRACY. PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN!\u201d\n\nIn remarks Monday evening, Biden said the court had done a \u201cterrible disservice\u201d to the American people, who he says deserved to know the outcome of the case before they head to the polls.\n\n\u201cThe American people will have to render a judgment about Donald Trump\u2019s behavior,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThe American people must decide whether Trump\u2019s assault on our democracy on Jan. 6 makes him unfit for public office.\u201d\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the ruling and what comes next:\n\nYour browser does not support the iframe HTML tag. Try viewing this in a modern browser like Chrome, Safari, Firefox or Internet Explorer 9 or later.\n\n_____\n\nTHE OPINION\n\nThe court\u2019s conservative majority said former presidents have absolute immunity from prosecution for official acts that fall within their \u201cexclusive sphere of constitutional authority\u201d and are presumptively entitled to immunity for all official acts. They do not enjoy immunity for unofficial, or private, actions.\n\nThe ruling means that special counsel Jack Smith cannot proceed with significant allegations in the indictment \u2014 or must at least defend their use in future proceedings before the trial judge.\n\nThe justices, for instance, wiped out Smith\u2019s use of allegations that Trump tried to use the investigative power of the Justice Department to undo the election results, holding that his communications with agency officials is plainly protected from prosecution.\n\nThe justices sent the case back to U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who must now \u201ccarefully analyze\u201d whether other allegations involve official conduct for which the president would be immune from prosecution.\n\nAmong the issues for further analysis is Trump\u2019s relentless badgering of then-Vice President Mike Pence to not certify the electoral votes on Jan. 6, 2021. The justices said it was \u201cultimately the Government\u2019s burden to rebut the presumption of immunity\u201d in Trump\u2019s interactions with Pence.\n\nThe order also directed additional analysis on the various posts on X, then known as Twitter, that Trump made \u2014 as well as a speech he delivered to supporters \u2014 in the run-up to the riot at the U.S. Capitol. Determining whether that communication represents official versus unofficial acts, the justices said, \u201cmay depend on the content and context of each\u201d and thus needs more scrutiny.\n\nTHE FAKE ELECTORS SCHEME\n\nThe justices required fresh fact-finding on one of the more stunning allegations in the indictment \u2014 that Trump had participated in a scheme orchestrated by allies to enlist slates of fraudulent electors in battleground states won by Biden who would falsely attest that Trump had won in those states.\n\nThe Trump team had argued that the selection of alternate electors was in keeping with Trump\u2019s presidential interest in the integrity and proper administration of the federal elections and cited as precedent an episode he said took place in the disputed election in 1876.\n\nThe Smith team, by contrast, portrayed the scheme as a purely private action that implicated no presidential responsibility.\n\nThe conservative justices in their majority opinion didn\u2019t answer the question as to which side was right, instead saying that \u201cdetermining whose characterization may be correct, and with respect to which conduct, requires a close analysis of the indictment\u2019s extensive and interrelated allegations.\u201d\n\nUnlike Trump\u2019s interactions with the Justice Department, the justices said, \u201cthis alleged conduct cannot be neatly categorized as falling within a particular Presidential function. The necessary analysis is instead fact specific, requiring assessment of numerous alleged interactions with a wide variety of state officials and private persons.\u201d\n\nTHE DISSENTERS\n\nThe three liberal justices \u2014 Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson \u2014 sharply criticized the majority\u2019s opinion in scathing dissents. Sotomayor gave a dramatic speech as she read her dissent from the bench, at times shaking her head and gritting her teeth as she said the conservative majority wrongly insulated the U.S. president as \u201ca king above the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cIronic isn\u2019t it? The man in charge of enforcing laws can now just break them,\u201d Sotomayor said.\n\nThe dissenting justices said the majority decision makes presidents immune from prosecution for acts such as ordering Navy seals to assassinate a political rival, organizing a military coup to hold onto power or accepting a bribe in exchange for a pardon.\n\n\u201cEven if these nightmare scenarios never play out, and I pray they never do, the damage has been done. The relationship between the President and the people he serves has shifted irrevocably. In every use of official power, the President is now a king above the law,\u201d Sotomayor wrote.\n\nPeople protest outside the Supreme Court Monday, July 1, 2024, in Washington.

The trial was supposed to have begun in March, but the case has been on hold since December to allow Trump to pursue his appeal. Chutkan had indicated at that time she would likely give the two sides at least three months to get ready for trial once the case returns to her court.\n\nThat had left the door open to the case potentially going to trial before the election if the Supreme Court \u2014 like the lower courts \u2014 had ruled that Trump was not immune from prosecution.\n\nBut the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling that Chutkan must conduct further analysis is expected tie the case up for months with legal wrangling over whether the actions in the indictment were official or unofficial.\n\nTRUMP\u2019S OTHER CASES\n\nTrump was convicted in May of 34 felony counts in his hush money trial in New York and is scheduled to be sentenced on July 11. The falsifying business records charges are punishable by up to four years behind bars, but there\u2019s no guarantee Trump will get prison time. Other possibilities include fines or probation.\n\nIt seems almost certain that Trump\u2019s two other criminal cases will not go to trial before the election.\n\nAn appeals court recently halted Trump\u2019s Georgia 2020 election interference case while it reviews the lower court judge\u2019s ruling allowing Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis to remain on the case. No trial date had been set in that case. Trump\u2019s lawyers have asserted presidential immunity in that case, though there\u2019s been no ruling.\n\nTrump was supposed to stand trial starting in May in the other case brought by Smith, over classified documents found at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate after he left the White House. But U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon canceled the trial date as the case got bogged down with legal issues. She has yet to schedule a new one. That case, too, involves a claim by the Trump team of immunity that prosecutors have disputed.\n\nLast week, Cannon set the stage further delays by agreeing to revisit a ruling by another judge that permitted crucial evidence related to allegations of obstruction of justice by Trump to be introduced into the case.\n\nOne of the arguments Cannon has entertained \u2014 that Smith was illegally appointed and that the case should be dismissed \u2014 got little traction with the Supreme Court.\n\nA separate concurrence from Justice Clarence Thomas concluded that Smith\u2019s appointment was improper, but no other justice signed onto that.\n\n_____\n\nAssociated Press reporters Michelle L.

        "text": "2024 US Presidential Election: Do Democrats have plan 'B' if Joe Biden withdraws?\nPotential situations\n\nWhat happens if Biden steps down?\n\nSelecting a Candidate\n\nAfter-convention situation\n\nFAQs:\n\n\n\n\n\n(You can now subscribe to our\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel\n\nAfter a debate with Donald Trump , several Democrats are unsure about Joe Biden 's candidacy for the 2024 US Presidential Election . Elaine Kamarck of the Brookings Institution told Reuters that replacing him is a complicated process.When it comes to their 2024 presidential nominee, the Democratic Party lacks a clear Plan B for taking President Joe Biden's place. After running unopposed for the position, Biden will get an official nomination later this summer. If a shift is necessary, Biden has three options: retire following the Democratic convention in Chicago in August, face a competitor who tries to win over his delegates, or move away before being selected. In the latter case, a new contender to challenge Donald Trump would be chosen by the Democratic National Committee ( DNC ).At the moment, Biden plays a major role in the process. Either he accepts to step down or a challenger drives him out. Biden hasn't indicated a willingness to step down thus far, and no opponent has taken him on directly. Prominent aspirants to the presidency, such as California Governor Gavin Newsom and Vice President Kamala Harris , have opposed Joe Biden's performance in the most recent debate and expressed strong support for Biden, as per the reports of Yahoo news.Four thousand Democratic delegates that Biden has amassed are eligible to vote for a different candidate in the event that he stands down. It is up to these delegates to cast their votes independently of Biden. One possibility is that Biden will \"release\" his delegates, which would force other Democratic contenders to fight for the nomination.Though there isn't a front-runner yet, many possibilities might succeed Biden. Despite her difficulties\u2014including low polling\u2014Harris would probably be a strong candidate. Newsom, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer are other candidates. Still, they are all in favor of Biden's candidacy at the moment, as per the reports of Yahoo News.Democratic heavyweights would compete for the nomination if Biden stepped aside. To be nominated, a candidate needs the signatures of 600 convention delegates. A \"brokered convention\" would take place in which delegates bargain to choose a nominee if no one receives a majority. There may be multiple voting rounds in this process. Democrats held their last brokered convention in 1952.If Biden resigns following the convention in August, the 435 DNC members will select a new nominee. These lawmakers would meet in a special session, representing different constituency groups. A minimum number of DNC members, as decided by the DNC Rules Committee, must endorse a candidate. Depending on when Election Day, November 5, falls, voting may take place virtually or in person.His nearly 4,000 delegates could vote for another candidate, potentially leading to a competition among Democrats for the nomination.Possible replacements include Kamala Harris, Gavin Newsom, JB Pritzker, Andy Beshear, and Gretchen Whitmer, all currently supporting Biden's campaign",

Even though second square-off between the incumbent President and former President is scheduled for September 10, several analysts have claimed that Biden could be replaced by the ruling Democrats in the US Presidential Election 2024.President Joe Biden's halting debate performance has led some in his own party to begin questioning whether he should be replaced on the ballot before November. However, there is no evidence Biden is willing to end his campaign. And it would be nearly impossible for Democrats to replace him unless he chooses to step aside, as per an AP report.US vice president Kamala Harris is President Biden's running mate, but that doesn't mean she can swap in for him at the top of the ticket by default. Biden also can't decree that she replace him should he suddenly decide to leave the race.The Democratic National Convention is being held in Chicago, but the party has announced that it will hold a virtual roll call to formally nominate Biden before in-person proceedings begin. The exact date for the roll call has not yet been set.If Biden opts to abandon his reelection campaign, Harris would likely join other top Democratic candidates looking to replace him. But that would probably create a scenario where she and others end up lobbying individual state delegations at the convention for their support.That hasn't happened for Democrats since 1960, when John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson jockeyed for votes during that year\u2019s Democratic convention in Los Angeles.Every state has already held its presidential primary. Democratic rules mandate that the delegates Biden won remain obligated to support him at the party's upcoming national convention unless he tells them he\u2019s leaving the race.Biden indicated that he had no plans to do that, telling supporters in Atlanta shortly after he left the debate stage, \u201cLet's keep going.\u201d Biden campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt was even clearer, saying Friday: \u201cOf course he's not dropping out.\u201dThe conventions and their rules are controlled by the political parties. The Democratic National Committee could convene before the convention opens on Aug. 19 and change how things will work, but that isn't likely as long as Biden wants to continue seeking reelection.The current rules read: \u201cDelegates elected to the national convention pledged to a presidential candidate shall in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them.\u201dIn addition to the vice president, others that had endorsed Biden in 2024 while harboring their own presidential aspirations for future cycles include California Governor Gavin Newsom, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Illinois Governor J. B. Pritzker and California Representative Ro Khanna.Still others who Biden bested during the party\u2019s 2020 presidential primary could also try again, including Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, as well as Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.If Biden were to abruptly leave the race, conservative groups have suggested they will file lawsuits around the country, potentially questioning the legality of the Democratic candidate's name on the ballot.But Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington, who wrote a book about the presidential nominating process and is also a member of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s rulemaking arm, said that courts have consistently stayed out of political primaries as long as parties running them weren\u2019t doing anything that would contradict other constitutional rights, such as voter suppression based on race.A1. Joe Biden is 81-year-old.A2. Second US Presidential Debate 2024 is scheduled for September 10 and will be live telecast on ABC.",

        "text": "Iran Update, July 1, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIran Update, July 1, 2024\n\nAndie Parry, Kitaneh Fitzpatrick, Brian Carter, Siddhant Kishore, Kelly Campa, Katherine Wells, Kathryn Tyson, and William Doran\n\nInformation Cutoff: 2:00pm ET\n\nThe Iran Update provides insights into Iranian and Iranian-sponsored activities abroad that undermine regional stability and threaten US forces and interests. It also covers events and trends that affect the stability and decision-making of the Iranian regime. The Critical Threats Project (CTP) at the American Enterprise Institute and the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) provides these updates regularly based on regional events. Click here to see CTP and ISW\u2019s interactive map of Israeli ground operations. This map is updated daily alongside the static maps present in this report.\n\nCTP-ISW defines the \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d as the unconventional alliance that Iran has cultivated in the Middle East since the Islamic Republic came to power in 1979. This transnational coalition is comprised of state, semi-state, and non-state actors that cooperate to secure their collective interests. Tehran considers itself to be both part of the alliance and its leader. Iran furnishes these groups with varying levels of financial, military, and political support in exchange for some degree of influence or control over their actions. Some are traditional proxies that are highly responsive to Iranian direction, while others are partners over which Iran exerts more limited influence. Members of the Axis of Resistance are united by their grand strategic objectives, which include eroding and eventually expelling American influence from the Middle East, destroying the Israeli state, or both. Pursuing these objectives and supporting the Axis of Resistance to those ends have become cornerstones of Iranian regional strategy.\n\nWe do not report in detail on war crimes because these activities are well-covered in Western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. We utterly condemn violations of the laws of armed conflict and the Geneva Conventions and crimes against humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports.\n\nHardline presidential candidate Saeed Jalili will likely win the Iranian presidential election in the runoff race on July 5. No candidate received the majority of votes needed to win the Iranian presidential election on June 28 and Iran will hold a runoff election between the two most popular candidates\u2014ultraconservative Saeed Jalili and reformist Masoud Pezeshkian\u2014on July 5.[1] Pezeshkian received 10.4 million votes while Jalili received around 9.5 million. The second most prominent hardline candidate\u2014Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf\u2014received around 3.4 million votes in the first round of elections on June 28, which was not enough to compete in the runoff election.[2] At least some Ghalibaf voters will presumably back Jalili in the runoff election, however, giving Jalili a significant advantage over Pezeshkian. Pezeshkian has also struggled to consolidate support among Iranian youth, a key voter demographic for the reformist faction.[3] Pezeshkian is unlikely to garner enough support to win against Jalili, especially since social media users have circulated statements in recent days of Pezeshkian boasting about his role in enforcing unpopular policies such as mandatory veiling.[4]\n\nThe Iranian regime is attempting to frame the July 5 presidential runoff elections as a fair and competitive race, despite Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei indicating a preference for hardline candidate Saeed Jalili. Khamenei has repeatedly expressed concern about low voter turnout rates in recent years and views participation in Iran\u2019s presidential elections as a demonstration of Iran\u2019s democratic legitimacy.[5] Iranian regime officials during this election cycle have attempted to reinforce the regime\u2019s democratic legitimacy by boasting that Pezeshkian\u2019s candidacy illustrated the legitimacy of Iran\u2019s electoral process.[6] Some Iranian university students confronted Pezeshkian in a meeting on June 16, framing his candidacy as an effort on the part of the regime to contribute to an \u201cillusion of democracy\u201d and an attempt by the regime to legitimize the elections.\u201c[7] The June 28 voter turnout rate was nevertheless unprecedently low at 40 percent, with the lowest recorded rates in Kermanshah, Kurdistan and Tehran provinces.[8] It is noteworthy that a significant percentage of anti-regime protests during the Mahsa Amini movement occurred in Kurdistan and Tehran provinces, suggesting continued disillusionment with the Iranian regime in these regions.[9]\n\nKhamenei and segments of Iran\u2019s clerical establishment have indirectly demonstrated a preference Jalili in recent days, making a Pezeshkian win unlikely regardless of how many votes he receives. Khamenei expressed foreign and nuclear policy views on June 25 that closely align with ultraconservative hardline presidential candidate Saeed Jalili\u2019s views, suggesting that Khamenei endorses Jalili.[10] Khamenei also indirectly criticized Pezeshkian\u2019s campaign policies on the same date, making it unlikely that Khamenei will permit him to become president. Segments of the Iranian clerical establishment may also back Jalili. Reformist-affiliated Entekhab News posted a screenshot on July 1 that it claimed showed coordination among Iranian clerics to campaign for Jalili in villages and cities across Iran.[11] Entekhab also circulated reports on July 1 that the influential Qom Seminary in Iran will close this week for its students and teachers to help improve voter turnout. Entekhab suggested that the Qom Seminary closures corroborated reports of clerics campaigning for Jalili.[12] It is likely, if the Qom Seminary closures are indeed connected with reports of clerics campaigning, that students and teachers will disperse to their hometowns\u2014specifically rural areas\u2014to generate support for Jalili. Rural and sparsely populated areas have historically served as a bastion of support for the regime and its hardline policies.[13] Roughly 35 percent of the Iranian population lives in rural areas and political engagement in these areas could furthermore improve voter turnout rates while benefiting Jalili.[14]\n\nThe Supreme Leader will risk further deteriorating regime legitimacy in the unlikely event that Pezeshkian garners enough votes to win the election. Khamenei has criticized Pezeshkian\u2019s policies and echoed Jalili\u2019s nuclear and foreign policies, indicating that Khamenei endorses Jalili over Pezeshkian. It is therefore unlikely that Khamenei will permit Pezeshkian to win, regardless of whether Pezeshkian receives the majority of votes. Raisi\u2019s 2021 election suggests that Khamenei is comfortable engineering elections to advantage his preferred candidate.[15] The Guardian Council denied the candidacies of several prominent politicians in the 2021 elections and Raisi therefore faced no significant competition in the race. It is unclear, however, how Khamenei will advantage his preferred candidate if Pezeshkian is able to generate increased support and win the election this week. The regime engineered the election results between reformist Mir Hossein Mousavi and hardline Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2009, galvanizing a months-long anti-regime protest wave.[16] Khamenei will risk further deteriorating regime legitimacy and possibly kickstarting unrest in the unlikely event that Pezeshkian garners significant support in the coming days.\n\nPalestinian militia groups in the West Bank appear to be strengthening at the expense of the Palestinian Authority. Palestinian militia fighters, Israeli military officials, and Palestinian Authority officials told the New York Times that Palestinian militia organizations control refugee camps in the West Bank by refusing to allow Palestinian Authority security forces to enter.[17] Palestinian fighters have prevented Palestinian Authority officials from entering refugee camps since before October 7, according to Palestinian media.[18] Fighters in Nur al Shams, east of Tulkarm, fired small arms at Palestinian Authority forces in June 2023 when the Palestinian Authority attempted to remove barriers that Palestinian militia fighters had placed at the entrances of the camp to prevent Israeli forces from entering.[19] Palestinian militia control of refugee camps in the West Bank provides a relatively safe area for Palestinian militias to build new capabilities and plan operations against both the IDF and the Palestinian Authority.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority\u2019s inability to exert effective control over refugee camps in the West Bank has significant implications for the post-war situation in the Gaza Strip, if these statements to the New York Times are accurate. The Palestinian Authority remains extremely unpopular, and Hamas will be able to easily justify continued resistance to the Palestinian Authority in the Gaza Strip if the authority assumes control with Israeli backing. A surviving Hamas in the Gaza Strip will attempt to rapidly resume its control over the Gaza Strip and continue its efforts to undermine the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. Hamas sees control over the Gaza Strip as an interim step to creating an Islamist Palestinian state controlling all of Israel and the Palestinian territories.[20]\n\nThe Iranian-guided effort to establish combined battalions in the West Bank since at least 2022 is almost certainly contributing to the gradual strengthening of Palestinian militia groups in the West Bank. Palestinian militias\u2014under Iranian direction\u2014have created a series of combined battalions in the West Bank since at least 2022, modeled on the Lion\u2019s Den militia in Nablus.[21] The New York Times interviewed a former Fatah militia member who had defected to Palestinian Islamic Jihad and now leads one of these combined battalions in Tulkarm.[22] This battalion includes all Palestinian factions in the area, including PIJ, Hamas, and the al Aqsa Martyrs\u2019 Brigade.[23] Palestinian militias in combined units are able to unify planning and logistics by combining their resources, thus improving the militias\u2019 capabilities and efficiency in aggregate.\n\nIsraeli security measures will likely constrain the groups\u2019 ability to quickly expand their capabilities, however. Israeli counter-smuggling efforts and IDF control over access to the West Bank make it challenging for Palestinian militia groups to successfully access enough materiel to build advanced explosive devices or weapon systems at scale. Israeli security forces have successfully interdicted relatively large smuggling operations throughout and prior to this war.[24] Major Israeli raids also disrupt the activity of nascent militia cells before these cells have time to build large stockpiles of weapons and explosives.[25] CTP-ISW has not observed a major and consistent change in militia capabilities during the war.\n\nIran is likely continuing its efforts to arm West Bank militias by smuggling arms through Jordan into the West Bank. The IDF thwarted an attempt to smuggle handguns and rifle parts into the West Bank from Jordan on July 1.[26] Three smugglers attempted to cross the border from Jordan into the northern West Bank.[27] Israeli border police and the IDF searched the area and discovered three bags containing over 75 handguns and dozens of M16 rifle components, including upper receivers, bolts, and charging handles.[28] Israeli security forces have not apprehended the three suspects at the time of writing.[29] The July 1 smuggling attempt is consistent with other Iranian-backed smuggling attempts.\n\nIran is supplying Palestinian militias with weapons to improve their capabilities and to foment unrest against Israel.[30] Both Israeli and Jordanian police have thwarted numerous attempts in recent months by Iran and its partners to transport small arms, explosives, mines, and rockets across the Jordan-West Bank border.[31] Iranian-backed smugglers often use established multinational narcotics-smuggling networks and routes to smuggle arms from Syria into Jordan.[32]\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) 98th Division continued clearing operations to degrade a reconstituted Hamas battalion and to demolish underground military infrastructure in Shujaiya, Gaza City, on July 1.[33] The IDF re-entered Shujaiya on June 27.[34] Hamas fighters in Shujaiya have targeted Israeli forces with sophisticated weapons, such as explosively formed penetrators, supporting the IDF assessment that the Hamas Shujaiya Battalion has at least partially reconstituted since the IDF last operated in the area in April 2024.[35] The IDF killed Hamas\u2018 Shujaiya Battalion commander and his deputy in December 2023, which led them to conclude the battalion was \u201dsignificantly damaged.\u201d[36] The IDF assesses that Hamas has partially rebuilt its battalion from new recruits and Hamas fighters from other degraded battalions.[37] One element of reconstitution is reorganization, in which a commander redistributes the resources at their disposal to restore attrited units to a minimal level of effectiveness.[38] Building composite units by combining several degraded or combat ineffective battalions is one common way to reorganize a force to be minimally combat effective. Israeli forces operating in Shujaiya have also destroyed weapons productions sites during the past several days of operations, indicating that Hamas\u2019 Shujaiya Battalion is also pursuing small-scale weapons production to replenish its stockpiles and aid in regeneration tasks.[39] CTP-ISW previously observed that Hamas cells have probably established a rear area in Jabalia or northern Shujaiya, from which they can mount attacks on IDF units along the Israel-Gaza Strip border.[40]\n\nThe IDF issued evacuation orders for eastern Khan Younis on July 1.[41] An IDF evacuation order typically means that Israeli forces will enter the area within 24 hours to begin clearing operations.[42] PIJ launched 20 rockets from Khan Younis into southern Israel roughly 10 hours before the IDF issued the order on July 1.[43] The IDF Air Force struck the launch site shortly after PIJ fired the barrage.[44] An Israeli military correspondent reported on June 23 that Hamas is reconstituting its military and governance structures in Khan Younis in the absence of Israeli force presence.[45] The IDF withdrew its forces from Khan Younis on April 7.[46] Hamas is also working to reassert local control in Khan Younis by deploying fighters on the streets, managing local policing, and taking over humanitarian aid shipments.[47] Hamas is restoring its governing organizations as well, which has prompted the IDF to target Hamas officials involved in these activities.[48] Hamas\u2019 reconstitution in Khan Younis is likely driving the IDF to conduct a short-term raid into Khan Younis. An IDF operation into Khan Younis may also target Hamas political and military leadership. CTP-ISW previously noted that the IDF\u2019s decision to withdraw its forces from Khan Younis enabled Hamas militants and political leadership to flee to Khan Younis.[49] Hamas leader in the Gaza Strip Yahya Sinwar is likely hiding in a \u201cvast\u201d tunnel system beneath Khan Younis, according to unspecified US officials speaking to the New York Times.[50] Hamas fighters\u2019 option to move northward contributed to their decision to not become decisively engaged in Rafah.\n\nIranian-backed Iraqi militias threatened to target US interests in Iraq and the Middle East in the event of an Israeli operation into southern Lebanon. The Iraqi Resistance Coordination Committee, a coordinating body comprised of Iranian-backed Iraqi militias, met on June 30 and threatened to target US interests in Iraq and the region and increase the \u201cpace and type\u201d of its operations if Israel launches a major military offensive into Lebanon.[51] Iranian-backed militias initially paused attacks against US forces in the region in February 2024 after IRGC Quds Force Commander Brigadier General Esmail Ghaani traveled to Baghdad and ordered a pause on the attack campaign after a Kataib Hezbollah drone attack killed three US soldiers in Jordan in January 2024.[52] The militias\u2019 announced strategy is partially inconsistent with a Saudi report that alleged Iranian-backed Iraqi militias would intervene in Lebanon by sending fighters and weapons to Lebanese Hezbollah if Israel launches a major military offensive into Lebanon. Both the IRGC and Hezbollah reportedly had reservations against such plans, which is consistent with the long-standing Iranian desire to avoid an overt regional war against the United States and Israel. The militia\u2019s newly articulated strategy is more consistent with the militia\u2019s attacks and involvement in the Israel-Hamas war thus far.[53]\n\nThe Iraqi Resistance Coordination Committee most recently threatened to resume its attack campaign on US forces and interests in the Middle East on June 19, citing the Iraqi government\u2019s failure to establish a timeline for a US troop withdrawal from Iraq.[54] The June 30 Coordination Committee statement citing a possible Israeli offensive into Lebanon as a trigger for new attacks comes after individual attempts by Iranian-backed Iraqi militia groups to resume attacks on US forces.[55] Emirati state media reported that other Islamic Resistance in Iraq militia leaders have disagreed with Kataib Hezbollah\u2019s calls to resume attacks targeting US forces in Iraq since April 2024. Kataib Hezbollah has reportedly begun to \u201dreconsider\u201d its decision to pause attacks.[56] Qais Khazali, who is the secretary general of Iranian-backed Iraqi militia Asaib Ahl al Haq, similarly threatened on June 24 to attack US interests if Israel launched a major military offensive into Lebanon.[57] Such calls appear to encourage action that would disobey the orders from the IRGC Quds Force commander in January to stop attacks.\n\nThe June 30 Iraqi Resistance Coordination Committee statement also identified targeting the under-construction Aqaba-Basra oil pipeline connecting Basra, Iraq to Aqaba port south of Jordan, as a \u201cstarting point\u201d for new attacks.[58] The Coordination Committee claimed that Aqaba-Basra oil pipeline is a \u201dmalicious project aimed at draining Iraqi resources and paving a path toward normalization with Israel\u201d. The pipeline project is strategically important for Iraq as it will offer a key alternative port to Iraq\u2019s currently existing exports terminal, eventually diversifying its export routes and linking Iraq\u2019s economy with those of its Arab neighbors.[59] The Coordination Committee and Iran may assess that this declared strategy of attacking Jordanian targets is less likely to elicit a US response and is therefore less risky than targeting US forces in the region. This lower-risk strategy would also be consistent with the long-standing Iranian desire to keep its militia activity at a level that does not cause the United States to seriously threaten Iranian assets.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nIran: Hardline presidential candidate Saeed Jalili will likely win the Iranian presidential election in the runoff race on July 5.\n\nHardline presidential candidate Saeed Jalili will likely win the Iranian presidential election in the runoff race on July 5.

        "text": "Increasing numbers of voters don't think Biden should be running after debate with Trump \u2014 CBS News poll\nFor months before the first debate, the nation's voters repeatedly expressed doubts over whether President Biden had the cognitive health enough to serve.\n\nToday, those doubts have grown even more: now at nearly three-quarters of the electorate, and now including many within his own party.\n\nAnd today, after the debate with former President Trump, an increased number of voters, including many Democrats, don't think Mr. Biden should be running for president at all. Nearly half his party doesn't think he should now be the nominee.\n\n(Trump, for his part, does better, but still only gets half the electorate thinking he has the cognitive health to serve.)\n\nThe move came across the partisan board, but it includes a double-digit movement among Democrats, and movement among independents.\n\nGiven that, today nearly three in four voters also don't think Mr. Biden should be running for president in the first place. That's a higher-percentage sentiment than in February, when almost two-thirds said he should not run.\n\nMost voters who say he shouldn't run say it's both about his campaigning and his effectiveness in office, along with his age.\n\nBut Democrats' concerns, when expressed, lean more toward the strategic. They are worried more about his ability to campaign than his decision-making as president.\n\nTrump, by contrast, finds a wide view among Republicans that he should be running.\n\nThat comes as voters widely believe that in the debate, Trump presented his ideas more clearly, appeared more presidential, inspired more confidence, explained his policies better and \u2014quite simply \u2014 won the debate.\n\nThis is the case, despite the fact that voters overall think Trump was not as truthful.\n\nAnd it's relative, of course. There are plenty of voters who think neither candidate did well.\n\nThese views are very similar whether people watched the debate live or just watched highlights or coverage about it, which may speak more generally to the way people get and process information in the modern era.\n\nAnd Mr. Biden has made no meaningful inroads on convincing voters that a second term would make them financially better off: Trump still is seen as better on this measure.\n\nNor has Mr. Biden cast himself as better than Donald Trump at protecting democracy.\n\nWhat now?\n\nAfter the debate, some Democratic officials reportedly said Joe Biden should step aside as the nominee and give another Democrat a chance to run for president in 2024.\n\nThat idea finds resonance with nearly half the nation's rank-and-file Democrats.\n\nThat's related to perceptions of Mr. Biden's health: Democrats who don't think Mr. Biden has the mental and cognitive health to serve are more likely to say he shouldn't be the nominee.\n\nAnd that former number has increased among Democrats. (It's also gone up among independents.)\n\nThe debate has brought the presidential race front and center to the minds of registered voters. Now 59% of registered voters say they are thinking a lot about the presidential race, up from 48% just a few days ago. Interest has risen among Democrats and Republicans alike.\n\nThis CBS News/YouGov survey is based on a national sample of 1,130 registered voters who were contacted between June 28-29, 2024. All respondents participated in an earlier national survey of 1,881 registered voters fielded June 17-21, 2024. The sample was weighted by gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as past vote and partisan identification and weighted to account for differential response rates. The margin of error for the sample of registered voters is \u00b14.2 points.",

        "text": "June 30, 2024, presidential election news\nPresident Joe Biden participates in the CNN presidential debate in Atlanta on June 27. Will Lanzoni/CNN\n\nA new poll from CBS News and YouGov conducted after Thursday\u2019s debate finds that nearly three quarters of registered voters say President Joe Biden should not be running for re-election (72%), up 9 points since February.\n\nNearly nine in 10 who say so (86%) consider his age a key reason why he should not be running, and 72% say Biden does not have the mental and cognitive health to serve as president, up seven points since earlier in June. Asked more directly whether Biden should step aside as the Democratic nominee to give another Democrat a chance to run, 64% of voters said he should.\n\nThe poll does not hold positive news on this front for former president Donald Trump either. About half (49%) say he does not have the mental and cognitive health to serve as president, and 54% say he should not be running for president.\n\nA closer look at the numbers: Among Biden\u2019s own partisans, 54% of Democrats say he should be running for president, while independents (82%) and Republicans (90%) are generally unified in thinking he should not be running.\n\nTrump holds stronger backing among Republicans than Biden does among Democrats: 85% of Republicans say Trump should be running for president. That drops to 43% among independents and 10% among Democrats.\n\nAmong all voters who say Trump should not be running, more cite his felony conviction (91%) and the decisions he might make in office (89%) than his age (62%) or concerns about him campaigning effectively (44%). There is not a large enough sample of Republicans who said Trump should not run to look at their results on questions about why.\n\nThe CBS/YouGov poll was conducted June 28-29 among 1,134 registered voters and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.2 percentage points.",

        "text": "Supreme Court gives win to Trump, ruling he has immunity for some acts in election interference indictment\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday raised the bar for prosecuting Donald Trump, ruling that he has immunity for some of his conduct as president in his federal election interference case but maybe not for other actions, adding another obstacle for special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s taking the case to trial.\n\nIn a novel and potentially consequential case about the limits of presidential power, the justices voted 6-3 along ideological lines to reject Trump\u2019s broad claim of immunity, meaning the charges related to his attempts to overturn the 2020 election results will not be dismissed, but they said some actions closely related to his core duties as president are off-limits to prosecutors.\n\n\"Big win for our Constitution and democracy. Proud to be an American,\" Trump said in a post in all capital letters on his social media website, Truth Social.\n\nTrump's Republican allies welcomed the ruling, while Democrats roundly condemned it. In televised remarks from the White House on Monday night, President Joe Biden called the decision \"a terrible disservice to the people of this nation.\"\n\n\"No one, no one is above the law, not even the president of the United States. [With] today\u2019s Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity, that fundamentally changed for all practical purposes,\u201d Biden said.\n\nDonald Trump; Jack Smith. Getty Images\n\nChief Justice John Roberts, writing for the majority, said further proceedings are needed in lower courts to determine what conduct Trump can be prosecuted for. Among the conduct that the court determined to be core presidential powers and therefore subject to immunity are Trump's contacts with Justice Department officials. Trump is also \"presumptively immune\" from being prosecuted for his contacts with Vice President Mike Pence in the weeks leading up to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by his supporters, Roberts wrote.\n\nThe indictment alleged that Trump sought to pressure the Justice Department to investigate unfounded claims of widespread election fraud as part of a plan to keep him in power despite Biden's election victory. Trump also wanted Pence to refuse to certify the election results as part of his ceremonial role at the joint session of Congress on Jan. 6.\n\n\"The President is not above the law,\" Roberts wrote. \"But Congress may not criminalize the President's conduct in carrying out the responsibilities of the Executive Branch under the Constitution.\"\n\nWhat that means for the case going forward remains to be seen. Trump\u2019s lawyer conceded in the oral argument in April that at least some of the allegations in the indictment concern private conduct that would not be protected by any immunity defense. Likewise, the Justice Department lawyer arguing the case for the special counsel said the prosecution could go ahead even if some official acts were protected.\n\nSmith's office declined to comment on the ruling Monday.\n\nAt a minimum, there will be further proceedings before U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan to determine what, if any, of the other conduct alleged in the indictment is protected. Among the acts she will review to determine whether they are subject to immunity are Trump's contacts with people outside the federal government, including state election officials such as Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, whom Trump pressured to reject results showing Biden victories.\n\nProsecutors will also have a chance to rebut the suggestion that Trump's contacts with Pence are protected. That determination would hinge on whether prosecuting Trump for those actions would \"pose any dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the executive branch,\" Roberts wrote.\n\nIn addressing the contacts with state election officials, Roberts wrote that the president has \"broad power to speak on matters of public concern,\" including the conduct of elections. On the other hand, the president \"plays no role\" in the certifying of elections by states, he added. Chutkan needs to conduct a \"close analysis\" of the indictment to determine whether Trump's actions are protected, Roberts said.\n\nIn another blow to Smith, the court ruled that none of the conduct for which Trump is immune can be admitted as evidence at trial in any form.\n\nThe court's three liberal justices strenuously dissented, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor writing that the ruling \"makes a mockery of the principle, foundational to our Constitution and system of Government, that no man is above the law.\"\n\nThe Constitution, she added, \"does not shield a former President from answering for criminal and treasonous acts.\"\n\nShe warned that the ruling could have broad ramifications by protecting presidents for a wide variety of actions.\n\n\"Let the President violate the law, let him exploit the trappings of office for personal gain, let him use his official power for evil ends,\" Sotomayor wrote. \"Because if he knew that he may one day face liability for breaking the law, he might not be as bold and fearless as we would like him to be. That is the majority's message today.\"\n\nIn a separate dissenting opinion, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson described the ruling as a \"five-alarm fire that threatens to consume democratic self-governance.\"\n\nEven if the new proceedings do not take much time, there is little chance for the trial to conclude before Election Day. It had previously been suggested that a trial would not start until at least three months after the Supreme Court ruling, which would mean it would potentially not start until early October at the earliest. The trial itself could last up to 12 weeks.\n\nThe case put the national spotlight on the court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority that includes three justices Trump appointed. The court handed Trump an election-year boost when it ruled in March that Colorado could not kick him off the ballot.\n\nThe justices were also criticized for their delay in taking up Trump\u2019s appeal, which some view in itself as a victory for him, as it meant the trial could not take place in March as originally planned.\n\nLegally speaking, the case was unprecedented, as no president has ever been prosecuted after having left office. Therefore, the court was wrestling with a legal question that had never come before it: whether a president has some form of immunity for his core duties derived from the constitutional principle of separation of powers, which delineates the powers of the presidency in relation to other branches of government.\n\nThe legal argument focused on Trump\u2019s official acts, with both sides agreeing that a former president does not have immunity for personal conduct.\n\nThe Supreme Court intervened after a federal appeals court had ruled Feb. 6 that Trump was not immune from prosecution, saying that once he left office he became \u201ccitizen Trump\u201d and should be treated like any other criminal defendant. The Justice Department has long maintained that a sitting president cannot be prosecuted.\n\nThe appeals court did not analyze which, if any, of the conduct in the indictment could be viewed as an official act, a fact that appeared to irk some of the justices during oral argument.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers pointed to a 1982 Supreme Court ruling that endorsed presidential immunity from civil lawsuits when the underlying conduct concerns actions within the \u201couter perimeter\u201d of the president\u2019s official responsibilities.\n\nSmith\u2019s team argued that there is no broad immunity that prevents former presidents from being prosecuted for criminal acts committed in office.\n\nThe federal indictment returned by a grand jury in Washington in August consisted of four counts: conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights, specifically the right to vote.\n\nIn another Jan. 6-related case, the court on Friday narrowed the scope of law penalizing the obstruction of an official proceeding. Trump also faces that charge, but legal experts say the Friday ruling may not affect his case.\n\nTrump, the indictment said, conspired to \u201coverturn the legitimate results of the 2020 presidential election by using knowingly false claims of election fraud to obstruct the government function by which those results are collected, counted and certified.\u201d\n\nThe indictment focuses on Trump\u2019s involvement in a scheme to submit fake election certificates to Congress in the hope that they would nullify Biden\u2019s victory. The chain of events culminated in the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\nTrump, who pleaded not guilty, says he was simply expressing his concerns, which were not based on any evidence, that the election was marred by widespread fraud. The case is one of four criminal prosecutions Trump is currently battling.",

And both Mitchum and Brooks underscore the big question of whether these non-2020 voters will actually show up in November.\n\nMitchum, 24, said he\u2019s definitely voting in 2024 \u2014 after not being registered to vote in 2020. \u201cYes, I am going to vote,\u201d he told NBC News in a follow-up interview.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t like what\u2019s going on with our border,\u201d he added, explaining why he supports Trump. \u201cAnother is I am partial to my gun rights.\u201d\n\nBut Brooks, 25, said in her follow-up interview that she\u2019s probably not voting in November, though she said she\u2019d support Trump in a poll. (Like Mitchum, Brooks wasn\u2019t registered to vote in 2020.)\n\n\u201cBiden, he seems to be just a little senile now,\u201d she told NBC News. \u201cAnd with Trump, there\u2019s all the legal stuff around him that\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen such a pony show,\u201d Brooks added.\n\nBiden\u2019s frequent voters versus Trump\u2019s infrequent ones\n\nIn 2020\u2019s presidential election, a record 159 million Americans turned out to vote. Still, tens of millions of eligible people like Mitchum and Brooks didn\u2019t participate, representing a significant segment of the potential electorate that could tip 2024\u2019s outcome.\n\nNBC News\u2019 polls in November 2023, January 2024 and April 2024 interviewed a combined total of 3,000 registered voters, most of whom were matched to historical voter files across the states.\n\nOf those who participated in both the 2020 presidential election and 2022 midterms \u2014 representing 56% of all interviewed voters \u2014 Biden led Trump by 5 percentage points, 49% to 44%, according to the merged polling.\n\nBut among those who voted only in 2020 \u2014 representing 17% of the interviews \u2014 Trump was ahead by 12 points, 50% to 38%.\n\nAnd Trump\u2019s lead over Biden was even bigger among those who didn\u2019t vote in 2020 (by 16 points) and those who didn\u2019t vote in both 2020 and 2022 (by 20 points).\n\nLooking at it this way, this election could come down to Biden\u2019s frequent voters versus Trump\u2019s infrequent ones.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s positive margins over Biden are coming from more infrequent voters \u2014 people who voted in 2020 and skipped the midterm election in 2022, or who have not voted in either election,\u201d said Republican pollster Bill McInturff, who co-conducts the NBC News poll.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the NBC News national poll that finds Trump overperforming with infrequent voters; surveys from The New York Times and the Cook Political Report with Amy Walter also show it.\n\nWill the infrequent voters show up in November?\n\nThe challenge for Trump, however, is that these non-2020 voters show far less interest in the upcoming presidential election \u2014 and thus are potentially less inclined to actually vote in November.\n\nThe same merged NBC News polling finds 73% of voters who participated in the 2020 and 2022 rated themselves as having high interest in the upcoming presidential election, giving themselves a \u201c9\u201d or \u201c10\u201d when asked to rate their interest on a 10-point scale. Only 44% of those who didn\u2019t vote in 2020, and 37% who voted in neither 2020 nor 2022, rated their interest in 2024 as that high.\n\nThese findings represent an enormous shift in American politics, given that Republicans used to produce the most reliable voters, while Democrats were more sporadic.\n\n\u201cForty years ago in a special election, the joke was \u2018pray for rain,\u2019 as the most dependable voters were college-educated, affluent Republicans who always voted,\u201d said McInturff, the GOP pollster.\n\nBut today, he added, \u201cthe data is clear that the consistent voter tips towards Biden.\u201d\n\nWho are the voters who didn\u2019t participate in 2020?\n\nAccording to NBC News\u2019 polling, the non-2020 voters disproportionately describe themselves as political moderates. They tend to lack college degrees. And they are more likely to be younger voters.\n\nBut some of them are older, like Maria Calderon, 52, of Houston. She explained why she didn\u2019t participate in the 2020 election: \u201cI had a lot going on in my life at the time.\u201d\n\nYet she told NBC News she will vote in November. \u201cI\u2019m gonna vote this year,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would be for Donald Trump, 100%.\u201d\n\nThe infrequent voters also have much more negative opinions of Biden than they do of Trump.\n\nAccording to NBC News\u2019 combined polling, Biden\u2019s net favorability rating sinks from minus-9 among 2020 and 2022 voters to minus-31 among those who didn\u2019t vote in either of the past two national elections. Trump\u2019s trend is the reverse, from minus-6 among those who didn\u2019t vote in 2020 and 2022, to minus-21 among those who participated in both.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not voting,\u201d said Vivian Lambert of Augusta, Georgia, who didn\u2019t participate in 2020. \u201cBut it would be Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just hear so many bad things about Biden,\u201d Lambert continued.\n\nStill, not all of these infrequent voters are Trump backers. Kelly Torz of Michigan, 25, says she didn\u2019t vote in 2020 but will vote for Biden in November, because of her support for abortion rights, the environment and LGBTQ issues.\n\n\u201cI care a lot about the environment, and Biden is going to hopefully help keep the ecosystem in a better condition than I believe Trump would,\u201d Torz said.\n\nAnd again, it\u2019s not a certainty that all of these voters who didn't participate last time will participate in 2024.\n\n\u201cMost likely I am,\u201d said Noah Fimon, 19, of Louisiana, who supports Trump.",

        "text": "What constitutes an 'official act' by a president?\nIn a historic ruling on Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court said former President Donald Trump is entitled to immunity from criminal prosecution for \"official\" acts taken as president, but not for any \"unofficial\" acts.\n\nThe 6-3 decision could have major implications for the various criminal cases pending against Trump -- especially special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s federal case, for which Trump faces four felony counts for alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nWhat constitutes an \"official\" versus an \"unofficial\" act by the president is not precisely defined in the opinion, and Chief Justice John Roberts acknowledged it could raise \"difficult questions.\"\n\n\"Certain allegations -- such as those involving Trump's discussions with the Acting Attorney General -- are readily categorized in light of the nature of the President's official relationship to the office held by that individual,\" Roberts wrote in the opinion. \"Other allegations -- such as those involving Trump's interactions with the Vice President, state officials, and certain private parties, and his comments to the general public -- present more difficult questions.\"\n\nIn addition to the core presidential duties laid out in the Constitution, conduct within the \"outer perimeter\" of official functions would be deemed immune as long as it is \"not manifestly or palpably beyond his authority.\"\n\nIt would be up to the lower courts to determine whether the conduct in question is considered official or unofficial.\n\n\"[Official acts are] something that you would expect the president to do -- kind of a core presidential duty, like acting as Commander-in-Chief of the military,\" said Chris Timmons, a former prosecutor and ABC News legal contributor. \"If the president of the United States sent troops to Lebanon, for example, he couldn't be prosecuted for murder.\"\n\nThough the ruling has been largely deemed a win for Trump, it\u2019s far from a get-out-of-jail-free card, legal experts told ABC News -- particularly when it comes to prosecution for actions he took not as the president but as a candidate.\n\nWhen it comes to allegations that Trump enlisted \"fake electors\" to overturn the 2020 election in his favor, for example, it would likely be difficult to argue that was done in his official capacity as president.\n\n\"The interaction with fake electors is not something a president does as part of his official duties -- it is something a candidate does as part of their campaign,\" Michael Gerhardt, a constitutional law expert at the University of North Carolina, told ABC News. \"That allows the court to say, I think rightly in this case, that Trump's interaction with the fake electors is really on the unofficial side, rather than official.\"\n\nEven so, punting the decision to the lower courts is almost certain to throw obstacles in the way of the pending litigation against Trump, slowing them down even further ahead of the election.\n\n\"The court basically said that as long as Trump or any president claims that what he was doing was acting officially, then his actions are presumptively constitutional, and it's up to the prosecutor to find evidence to overcome that presumption, and that is not going to be easy,\" Gerhardt said.\n\nSome legal experts expect Smith may reevaluate the federal case against Trump, possibly jettisoning some elements that could prove shakier due to the Supreme Court ruling.\n\n\"One option is to try to streamline the case considerably to only those acts that either Trump conceded were unofficial, or those acts plus some that Jack Smith thinks he has the best chance of persuading the courts are unofficial, and then proceed on that basis in the interest of efficiency,\" Jessica Roth, a former federal prosecutor and Cardozo Law professor, told ABC News. \"Or does he want to be more aggressive and try to keep more of the allegations in the case, which might be more risky for him in terms of ultimately prevailing?\"",

        "text": "June 28 Results: Iran's 2024 Presidential Election\nIn a stunning blow to Iran\u2019s theocracy, the majority of voters\u2014some 60 percent\u2014boycotted the snap presidential election held on June 28, 2024. It was the lowest turnout since the 1979 revolution ended more than two millennia of dynastic rule. The election also illustrated the wide split among those Iranians willing to vote. None of the four candidates who were allowed to run\u2014out of 80 who registered\u2014won the majority of votes. The two frontrunners reflected opposite ends of Iran\u2019s narrow political spectrum. Masoud Pezeshkian, a reformist member of parliament and dark-horse, came in first, with 10.4 million. Saeed Jalili, a hardliner and former nuclear negotiator, came in second, with 9.4 votes. They faced a run-off on July 5.\n\nThe low turnout among Iran\u2019s 61 million voters reflected deep public discontent and political apathy about the regime in Tehran. For decades, the government had cited voter participation as a reflection of the theocracy\u2019s legitimacy. The unprecedented boycott\u2014instigated partly by human rights activists, political prisoners, writers, filmmakers, and relatives of protesters slain in government crackdowns\u2014sent a strong message at a precipice for the Islamic revolution.\n\nAfter the death of President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter accident, Iran faced growing questions about the future of the revolution ahead of the looming succession of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who turned 85 in April 2024. Raisi, a cleric, had been one of two leading contenders to become the next supreme leader. But for the first time since 1981, neither of the final presidential contenders was a cleric \u2014 and therefore ineligible to replace Khamenei. Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, the speaker of parliament and a former Revolutionary Guards commander, was reportedly the regime\u2019s favored candidate. He came in a distant third.\n\nPezeshkian and Jalili on a front page\n\nThe Results\n\nMasoud Pezeshkian : 42.45%\n\n: 42.45% Saeed Jalili: 38.61%\n\n38.61% Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf: 13.78%\n\n13.78% Mostafa Pourmohammadi: 0.84%\n\nIn five debates ahead of the poll, Pezeshkian called for improving relations with the West, greater social freedoms and equal rights for women. Jalili pledged to continue the policies of President Raisi, such as expanding ties with non-Western powers and emphasizing the traditional role of women as homemakers.\n\nTurnout declined in all but one of Iran\u2019s 31 provinces compared to the last presidential election in 2021. The only province that showed a slight increase, three percent, was Qom, the bastion of Shiite seminaries and regime supporters.\n\nProvinces with large ethnic minorities marginalized by the central government witnessed particularly low turnout. Pezeshkian, who was born to an Azeri father and a Kurdish mother, championed inclusion and diversity during his campaign. Although he won in most of Iran\u2019s border provinces home to minorities, he failed to generate enough enthusiasm to boost participation in provinces with large Azeri or Kurdish populations.\n\nTurnout in Kermanshah province, home to many Kurds, was down 29 percent compared to the 2021 election. Sistan and Baluchistan, home to the Baluch minority, was down 23 percent. Turnout in Khuzestan, home to many Arabs, was down 20 percent. The government crackdown on the 2022 anti-government protests sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman detained for poor hijab, was especially bloody in provinces populated by minorities.\n\nAfter the first round, both candidates appealed to voters on social media, held political rallies, and called on prominent allies to mobilize voters. Qalibaf endorsed Jalili, who could pick up many of Qalifbaf\u2019s three million votes. Pezeshkian faced an uphill battle. \u201cIf we do not unite, the future of Iran is in danger,\u201d he warned in on X (formerly Twitter). \u201cThose who are part of the problem cannot save us.\u201d One of Pezeshkian\u2019s prominent supporters put the choice in starker terms. \u201cWe won\u2019t let Iran fall to the Taliban,\u201d Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi, a former telecommunications minister, posted in reference to the rigid rulers in neighboring Afghanistan.\n\nThe Islamic republic has only held one other run-off vote for president. In 2005, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the little-known mayor of Tehran, defeated veteran politico and former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\n*Iran held a second presidential election in 1981 after the assassination of President Mohammad Ali Rajai, who was in office for less than a month.\n\nPhoto Credits: Oganesson007, CC BY 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons",

        "text": "James Carville\nAmerican international political consultant (born 1944)\n\nChester James Carville Jr. (born October 25, 1944) is an American political consultant, author and occasional actor who has strategized for candidates for public office in the United States and in at least 23 nations abroad.[1] A Democrat, he is a pundit in U.S. elections who appears frequently on cable news programs, podcasts, and public speeches.\n\nNicknamed the \"Ragin' Cajun\",[2] Carville gained national attention for his work as a lead strategist in Bill Clinton's winning 1992 presidential campaign.[3] Carville also had a principal role crafting strategy for three unsuccessful Democratic Party presidential contenders, including Massachusetts Senator John Kerry in 2004, New York Senator Hillary Clinton in 2008, and Colorado Senator Michael Bennet in 2020.\n\nHe is married to longtime Republican political consultant Mary Matalin.\n\nEarly life and education [ edit ]\n\nCarville was born on October 25, 1944, at a U.S. Army hospital at Georgia's Fort Benning (now Fort Moore), where his father was stationed during World War II.[4] While his mother, Lucille (n\u00e9e Normand), had stayed behind in Carville, Louisiana, where James was raised, she traveled to Fort Benning long enough to have her firstborn son born there. Later, Carville noted: \"We were availing ourselves to free government health services.\"[5] Lucille Carville, a former school teacher, spoke French at home, and sold the World Book Encyclopedia door to door. His father, Chester James Carville Sr., was a postmaster and owner of a general store.[6][7][8]\n\nCarville, Louisiana, on the Mississippi River\n\nCarville, Louisiana, a neighborhood in the city of St. Gabriel, in Iberville Parish, located 16 miles south of the capital city of Baton Rouge on the Mississippi River, was named after his paternal grandfather Louis Arthur Carville, who was once the postmaster.[9] Louis Arthur's mother, Octavia Dehon, was of Belgian parentage and had married John Madison Carville, described in a biography as \"Irish-born\" and a \"carpetbagger.\"[10] Together, they established the general store operated by the family in Carville, in 1882.[11] Carville has seven siblings (Bonnie, Mary Ann, Gail, Pat, Steve, Bill, and Angela.).\n\nAmong Carville's earliest political campaign work was ripping down the campaign signs of a candidate for public office during high school.[12] Carville graduated from Ascension Catholic High School in Donaldsonville, Louisiana, in 1962.[13][7]\n\nHe attended Louisiana State University (LSU) from 1962 to 1966, but did not graduate at that time. In a 1994 feature in Newsweek, Carville characterized himself as \"something less than an attentive scholar. I had 56 hours' worth of Fs before LSU finally threw me out.\"\n\nCarville served a two-year enlistment in the United States Marine Corps, from 1966 to 1968, where he was stationed stateside, at Camp Pendleton in Oceanside.[13] He attained the rank of corporal.[14]\n\nFollowing his military enlistment, Carville finished his studies at LSU at night, where he earned his Bachelor of Science degree in general studies in 1970 and his Juris Doctor degree in 1973.[15] Carville is a member of the Sigma Nu fraternity.[16][17] He later worked as a junior high school science teacher. Before entering politics, Carville worked as an attorney at McKernnan, Beychok, Screen and Pierson, a Baton Rouge law firm, from 1973 to 1979.[13]\n\nPolitical consulting in the United States 1970s to 1990s [ edit ]\n\nCarville was trained in consulting by Gus Weill, who in 1958 had opened the first advertising firm that specialized in political campaigns in the state capital in Baton Rouge.[18]\n\nEast Baton Rouge Parish, 1970s and 1980s [ edit ]\n\nIn a 2012 piece he wrote for Foreign Affairs, Carville described one of his earliest political jobs distributing \"hate sheets\" with negative literature on a political opponent at grocery stores on behalf of Ossie Bluege Brown, during Brown's 1972 campaign for district attorney of East Baton Rouge Parish.[19] Two years earlier, Brown had defended Staff Sergeant David Mitchell, the first of 17 soldiers charged in connection with the deaths of villagers during the M\u1ef9 Lai massacre.[20] Brown's tenure as D.A. was marked by his crusades against narcotics and pornography. In 1973, Brown prevented Baton Rouge theaters from showing Bernardo Bertolucci's X-rated film, Last Tango in Paris, In 1979, Brown blocked the showing of the comedy, Monty Python's Life of Brian. Brown asked Baton Rouge magazine distributors not to offer the March 1977 issue of Hustler, which a state court judge in Ohio ruled obscene.[21]\n\nIn addition to his work as an attorney, in the late 1970s, Carville also worked for Gus Weill and Raymond Strother at Weill-Strother,[22] a Baton-Rouge-based political consulting firm that, over the years, had assisted with electoral campaigns and political messaging for Louisiana governors Jimmie Davis, John McKeithen, Edwin Edwards, and U.S. Representative Otto Passman.[23]\n\nIn the early 1980s, Carville served as executive assistant to East Baton Rouge Parish mayor-president Pat Screen.[24]\n\nIn early 1985, Carville consulted to help Cathy Long win a special election to central Louisiana's now-defunct 8th congressional district, following the death of her husband, Gillis William Long, of Louisiana's Long family political dynasty.[25]\n\nTexas Senate race, 1984 [ edit ]\n\nIn 1984, Carville became acquainted with his consulting partner Paul Begala when Carville managed then-Texas state legislator Lloyd Doggett's unsuccessful campaign for the open Texas Senate seat. Carville helped Doggett, an unabashed liberal and committed enemy of special interests,[26] secure the Democratic nomination in a primary that included conservative U.S. Representative Kent Hance, and centrist former congressman Bob Krueger. During the primary, Carville borrowed a rubber vertebrae exhibit from a friend who was a personal injury attorney and coached Doggett on using it as a prop on the stump to attack Krueger as a political flip flopper, who lacked resolve and \"backbone.\"[27]\n\nDuring the general election, Doggett's opponent, Phil Gramm, leveraged vicious identity-based attacks on Doggett. On one occasion, Doggett returned the small dollar fundraising he received from a gay rights group.[28] Gramm emphasized themes of \"family values,\" including his insistence at a June 1984 prayer breakfast on \"having people who believe in Christianity in charge of government,\" and Carville counter-punched that theme as antisemitic.[29] Doggett was defeated in the general election, polling 2,207,557 votes (41.5 percent), to Gramm's 3,116,348 votes (58.5 percent).\n\nFinding himself out of work after the November 1984 defeat, Carville recalled, \"I was scared to death, I was 40 years old, and didn't have any health insurance, I didn't have any money, I was mortified.\"[30]\n\nPennsylvania gubernatorial election, 1986 [ edit ]\n\nCarville helped Bob Casey Sr. win election as the 42nd Governor of Pennsylvania in 1986. Casey defeated Philadelphia District Attorney Ed Rendell in the Democratic primary in March, 56.5% to 39.6%.[31]\n\nIn the general election, Casey's Republican opponent, Lieutenant Governor Bill Scranton, took the lead in the polls after announcing that his campaign was pulling all negative ads and challenging Casey to do the same. However, the Scranton campaign misstepped by sending a mailer to 600,000 Republican voters that, in addition to a letter from Scranton's father, former Pennsylvania Governor and U.N. Ambassador William Scranton, included a brochure harshly attacking Casey's ethics.\n\nCarville \u2013 who, The New York Times would later write, was brought into the campaign to \"ramp up the aggression level\" \u2013 began to counter, contacting journalists and characterizing the mailer as outrageous. Scranton claimed he did not know about the mailing, so Carville ordered 600,000 blank envelopes, loaded them onto a truck, and dumped them onto a street corner near Scranton's campaign headquarters. Television cameras captured the campaign, asking: \"How could you send out this many envelopes and not know about it?\"[32] Three weeks before the election, a poster appeared statewide, depicting Scranton as a \"long-haired, dope smoking hippie.\"[33]\n\nThe race was virtually tied until five days before the election, when Carville launched the \"guru,\" a TV commercial that portrayed Scranton as having been a regular drug user during the 1960s, also mocking Scranton's interest in transcendental meditation and his ties to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.[34] The image of Scranton as a meditating, long-haired, dope-smoking hippie, with a background of sitar music, was credited with tipping the scales against Scranton in the socially conservative rural sections of Pennsylvania where Carville selectively decided to run the \"guru\" TV commercial.[35] Casey went on to win the election by a narrow margin of 79,216 out of 3.3 million total votes cast, or 50.7% of the vote to Scranton's 48.4%.[36]\n\nKentucky gubernatorial contest, 1987 [ edit ]\n\nIn 1987, Carville worked as a campaign manager to cast Kentucky businessman Wallace Wilkinson as a self-made millionaire anti-establishment gubernatorial candidate.[37] Wilkinson, who had made his fortune in retail, and real estate development, and who was sued for not paying overtime to his employees, and refused to release his tax returns to the public,[38] charged his Democratic primary opponents with wanting to raise taxes, and continually campaigned on creating a state lottery to raise public revenue.\n\nDuring the general election portion of the campaign, on September 25th, 1987, Carville appeared on WLEX-TV's \"Your Government\" public affairs program and implored reporters to look into the background of Wilkinson's opponent John Harper's family, noting: \"there might be problems with some of Harper's children.\"[39] After the incident, Harper confirmed that his son had been shot and killed by Franklin County, Ohio, police during a 1978 pharmacy robbery.[40] Wilkinson won the general election polling 504,674 votes (64.5%) to Harper's 273,141 (34.91%),[41] and, as Kentucky's 57th governor, secured passage of a state constitutional amendment to allow a lottery.\n\nNew Jersey senatorial contest, 1988 [ edit ]\n\nCarville served as campaign manager to New Jersey U.S. Senator Frank Lautenberg during Lautenberg's successful 1988 re-election campaign.[42] Carville and his partner Paul Begala both led Lautenberg's successful campaign against Republican challenger Pete Dawkins, a Brigadier General and former Heisman Trophy winner who had Roger Stone as a consultant.[43]\n\nGeorgia gubernatorial contest, 1990 [ edit ]\n\nGeorgia Governor Zell Miller with President Bill Clinton\n\nIn 1989 and 1990, Carville assisted conservative Democrat and four-term lieutenant governor Zell Miller in winning the state party's gubernatorial nomination in a five-candidate contest that included Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young, then-state senator Roy Barnes, and former governor Lester Maddox.\n\nMiller campaigned on a platform of shock incarceration boot camps for first-time drug offenders, blasted Young for \"an explosion of crime\" in Atlanta, and painted Young with wanting to \"run away from\" the issue of drugs.[44] At Carville's counseling,[45] Miller made a state lottery in lieu of state tax increases a central theme of his campaign.[46] Carville attributed Miller's eleven-point primary victory over Young to the attraction of the lottery issue and its capacity to turn out white suburban voters. \"Zell Miller was able to set the agenda, and the agenda was the lottery\", Carville noted.[47]\n\nMiller won the nominating contest in the August 1990 runoff against Young and later defeated Johnny Isakson in the November 1990 general election. Miller was later a keynote speaker at the 1992 Democratic National Convention and the 2004 Republican National Convention.\n\nTexas gubernatorial election, 1990 [ edit ]\n\nTexas Attorney General Jim Mattox\n\nCarville consulted in 1990 for former Texas Congressman and sitting state Attorney General Jim Mattox, a bare-knuckled political brawler who routinely traveled to Huntsville to attend state executions in Texas, the most active state in carrying out the death penalty. On advice from Carville, Mattox, who was seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination that year, based his campaign on the claim that a state lottery would solve Texas' revenue needs without additional state taxes.[48]\n\nWith no facts to support the charge, Mattox also ran a television advertisement accusing his primary opponent, State Treasurer Ann Richards, a recovering alcoholic, of being a cannabis and cocaine user who might falter in fulfilling the responsibilities of being governor.[49][50] In losing the nominating contest to Richards, Mattox gained a reputation as a combative campaigner.[51]\n\nPennsylvania special senatorial election, 1991 [ edit ]\n\nIn 1991, Carville consulted for Harris Wofford in his run for the open U.S. Senate seat left vacant when Senator John Heinz was killed in an April 1991 plane crash. Following the crash, Carville, who was by then a close political confidant of Governor Casey, hatched a plan to offer his appointment of the Senate seat to Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca, an Allentown native who declined the offer within 24 hours.[52] Attorney and later Pittsburgh Steelers owner Art Rooney II was also considered. Still, Casey ultimately decided to appoint Wofford, then his state Secretary of Labor, to fill the seat, and Wofford faced a special election in November of that year.\n\nAgainst the national backdrop of the first Gulf War, and a dour economy, Wofford's general election opponent, George H.W. Bush's sitting U.S. Attorney General, Dick Thornburgh, was widely seen as a surrogate of the Bush political machine, and the contest was widely viewed as an early referendum on Bush's reelection prospects the following year.[53]\n\nWofford was one of the first whites to graduate from Howard University School of Law, traveled to India and wrote a book on Gandhi, co-founded the Peace Corps, and was arrested at the 1968 Democratic National Convention for disorderly conduct, and was an opponent of apartheid. A philosophical progressive and college president, he had served as an aide to John F. Kennedy,[54] and was a friend and adviser to Martin Luther King Jr.[55] Wofford had the air of an \"anti-politician,\" rumpled in appearance and uncomfortable with small talk, who ran a campaign with themes of economic populism.[56]\n\nThough the issue polled a distant 5th in voter concerns, Wofford eschewed guidance from his consultants in demanding national health insurance be the centerpiece of his campaign. With the assistance of a guild of Philadelphia ophthalmologists, Wofford crafted an impactful slogan: \"If criminals have access to a lawyer, working Americans should have a right to a doctor.\"[57]\n\nDuring the race, Carville helped Wofford craft an aggressive campaign, [58] with television advertisements attacking Thornburgh for taking expensive flights at public expense in government jets to junkets in places such as Hawaii. Another Wofford campaign commercial evoked an anti-establishmentarian air, linking Thornburgh to \"the mess in Washington.\"[59]\n\nIn the months before the election, Wofford overcame Thornburgh's 44-point lead in the polls and defeated him in November, garnering 1,860,760 votes (55 percent) to Thornburgh's 1,521,986 (45 percent).\n\nWofford's surprise victory helped earn Carville national attention, with the Democratic Party now hoping that he could now help the party win the White House in 1992 U.S. Presidential election.[59]\n\nCarville again consulted for Wofford's re-election campaign in 1994 when he was narrowly defeated by Republican Rick Santorum.\n\nLos Angeles mayoral election, 1992\u20131993 [ edit ]\n\nIn late 1992 and early 1993, Carville consulted for San Fernando Valley state assemblyman Richard Katz in his run for the open 1993 Los Angeles mayoral election, which was the first time in 63 years that an incumbent mayor didn't appear on the ballot.[60] Katz ran on a tough-on-crime platform that included gun control, new sales taxes on firearms and ammunition, and selling-off city-owned infrastructure, such as the Ontario International Airport, to pay police overtime, while promising not to raise property taxes.[61] Despite retaining Carville, and spending a million dollars on campaign television commercials, Katz finished behind three other candidates, garnering 46,173 votes, or 9.73% of 474,366 total votes cast in the nonpartisan blanket mayoral primary, and did not advance to the general election.[62]\n\nBill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign [ edit ]\n\nBill Clinton in October 1992\n\nIn 1992, Carville helped lead Bill Clinton to a win against George H. W. Bush in the presidential election. In crafting an economic strategy for Clinton, Carville reprised the populist rhetoric his client, Pennsylvania Senator Harris Wofford, successfully wielded the prior year, which was distilled into a series of articles Donald L. Barlett and James B. Steele wrote for The Philadelphia Inquirer. The articles were re-printed into book form: America: What Went Wrong? which became a prop Clinton brandished effectively from the stump during a time of economic recession. In bringing in the series of articles from the Wofford campaign, Carville imported an angry left-wing populism as a campaign theme.[63]\n\nOne of the formulations he used in that campaign has entered common usage, derived from a list he posted in the campaign war room to help focus himself and his staff, with these three points:\n\nCarville sought to shield Clinton from Gennifer Flowers' allegations of her extramarital sexual affair, which emerged shortly before the 1992 New Hampshire Democratic primary. Carville alleged that a supermarket tabloid paid Flowers $175,000 for sharing her story, and that \"the mainstream media got sucker-punched\" by her allegations.[65] Carville set out to shame the press, berating reporters with charges of \"cash for trash\" journalism, and noted: \"I'm a lot more expensive than Gennifer Flowers.\".[66] Flowers later brought a civil suit against Carville in 1999 (see below).\n\nIn June 1992, trailing George H. W. Bush and Ross Perot in the polls, Clinton limped toward the national convention, while the Los Angeles riots crowded him out of news coverage.[67] Carville knew he needed to bring Clinton back into the news limelight. He did so by orchestrating Clinton's splashy criticism of hip hop artist Sister Souljah in a prepared speech Clinton delivered at the Rainbow Coalition's June 1992 \"Rebuild America\" conference in Washington, D.C.[68] Sister Souljah had remarked: \"If black people kill black people every day, why not have a week and kill white people?\" Clinton responded in his speech by saying, \"If you took the words, 'white' and 'black' and you reversed them, you might think David Duke was giving that speech.\" Clinton refuted the suggestion that his speech was a calculated attempt to appeal to moderate and conservative swing voters by standing up to a core Democratic constituency.[69] The speech had the effect of opening up a public war between Clinton and Jesse Jackson.[70]\n\nIn 1993, Carville was honored as Campaign District Manager of the Year by the American Association of Political Consultants. His role in the Clinton campaign was documented in the feature-length Academy Award-nominated film The War Room.\n\nAmerican politics during the 1990s [ edit ]\n\nCarville continued to serve the Democratic National Committee in a political capacity during the 1990s, and had an ongoing need to regularly visit the White House to speak with then President Bill Clinton on political matters.[71] Accordingly, Carville was once one of only twenty individuals at the time who was granted a permanent \"Non-Government Service\" security badge, which were used for non-government employees, such as contractors, who needed regular access to the White House grounds. In consideration for the privilege of the permanent pass, the Clinton Administration asked Carville to submit to a full security clearance style FBI background check.[71]\n\nIn response to the 1997 civil lawsuit then Arkansas state employee Paula Jones filed against Bill Clinton over her claims of sexual harassment while attending a conference on official business, Carville infamously remarked: \"Drag a hundred dollars through a trailer park and there's no telling what you'll find.\"[72][73] South Carolina U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham later made reference to Carville's trailer park line during the 2018 Brett Kavanaugh SCOTUS confirmation hearings in reference to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford. During an October, 2018 interview with Michael Smerconish on CNN, on the topic of Graham alluding to Carville's \"drag $100\", Carville remarked that, at the time, \"I was making a joke\", and added \"I'm always complimented when people use my lines; you always like to leave a little legacy out there.\"[74]\n\nIn 1999, Gennifer Flowers, who had previously alleged an affair with Carville's 1992 client Bill Clinton, sued Carville and his colleague George Stephanopoulos for defamation of character. In 2000, Flowers additionally named Hillary Clinton as a defendant in the suit.[75] Attorney Larry Klayman of Judicial Watch, a conservative advocacy organization, represented her in the suit.[76] Flowers contended that Carville and Stephanopoulos ignored obvious warning signs that news media reporting did not conclusively determine that tapes of her recorded telephone conversations with Clinton were \"doctored.\"[77] In 2004, a federal district court dismissed the case with summary judgment.[77] Klayman then appealed the case on Flowers' behalf.[78] In 2006, 14 years after the allegations of the affair became an issue for Bill Clinton's first presidential campaign, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit affirmed the lower court's dismissal.[79]\n\nInternational elections 1990s to 2010s [ edit ]\n\nBeginning in the mid-1990s, Carville worked on a number of election campaigns abroad, including those of Tony Blair, then Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, during the 2001 general election (in which Blair was comfortably re-elected), and with the Liberal Party of Canada.\n\nCarville viewed working campaigns abroad as more commercially lucrative, and with less reputational risk than campaigns in the United States noting in 2009: \"If you help elect a president and then you get involved in a governor's race and you lose, it's going to be a little bit damaging to your reputation. But if you go to Peru and you run a presidential race and you lose, no one knows or cares. So why go to New Jersey and lose for 100 grand when you can go to Peru and lose for a million?\" [80]\n\nCarville has been less forthcoming to the news media about his work abroad, and remarked to a Los Angeles Times reporter in 1999, \"I won't comment on anything I do outside the U.S.\"[81]\n\nWork with U.S. State Department [ edit ]\n\nIn 2002, on behalf of the U.S. State Department, Carville, and his wife, political consultant Mary Matalin, met with a group of 55 Arab women political leaders during the 2002 United States midterm elections. The programming, \"Women as Political Leaders\" International Visitor (IV) Program\", was the first program implemented under the auspices of the Middle East Partnership Initiative, a collection of 40 programs headed by then deputy assistant secretary for Near East Affairs Liz Cheney.[82] In addition to events with Carville and Matalin, the group met with congressional, state and local campaign staff, and observed campaign work during their visits to Concord, New Hampshire, Dallas, Texas, Detroit, Michigan, Toledo, Ohio, Raleigh, North Carolina, and Tallahassee and Tampa, Florida.[83]\n\nThat year, Carville also proposed visiting Arab and Muslim nations on behalf of the US government to do \"some kind of propaganda,\" adding \"I'd love to use my experience and skills to tell people about my country and what's available to them beyond hopelessness and terrorism.\" He added, \"What the terrorists are after is the younger and increasingly poor population. What they are offering is not that much, but we are not doing a good job telling those young people the other side of the story. It's time we told them about choices they have without imposing American values.\" [84]\n\nGreece, 1993 [ edit ]\n\nCarville, Begala, and Mary Matalin advised incumbent Greek Prime Minister Konstantinos Mitsotakis in an election that saw local Greek press allege United States interference in the election.[85] Unpopular because his program of economic austerity and privatization, Mitsotakis failed in his reelection bid, and lost to democratic socialist Andreas Papandreou.\n\nBrazil, 1994 [ edit ]\n\nFernando Henrique Cardoso\n\nIn 1994, Carville consulted for Fernando Henrique Cardoso in his successful 1994 campaign for the Brazilian presidency.[86] Cardoso, a professor and Fulbright Fellow lectured in the United States during the 1980s at Columbia University on issues of democracy in Brazil. Cardoso, often nicknamed \"FHC\", was elected with the support of a heterodox alliance of his own Social Democratic Party, the PSDB, and two right-wing parties, the Liberal Front Party (PFL) and the Brazilian Labour Party (PTB). During his tenure in office, Cardoso's administration liquidated public assets and deepened the privatization of government-owned enterprises in steel milling, telecommunications and mining, along with making reforms to Brazil's social security income program and tax systems.\n\nHonduras, 1997 [ edit ]\n\nIn 1997, Carville consulted for then leader of the National Congress of Honduras, Carlos Flores Facuss\u00e9, in his presidential campaign.[87] Flores attended the American School of Tegucigalpa, studied international finance at Louisiana State University in the early 1970s, and married a U.S. citizen from Tennessee.[88]\n\nHonduran president Carlos Flores shakes hands with United States president Bill Clinton at Soto Cano Air Base in Honduras.\n\nHe later became the publisher of his family's La Tribuna, a leading Honduran newspaper, and served on various corporate boards of directors, including the Central Bank of Honduras,[89] and became involved in politics. Flores was aligned with former president Roberto Suazo C\u00f3rdova's Rodista faction, the more conservative wing of the liberal party. Vowing to move Honduras past its image of being primarily a banana and coffee exporter, Flores campaigned on his \"New Agenda\" platform, which included a ten-point plan to stabilize the economy. Flores distanced himself from the outgoing Reina administration, while successfully portraying himself as an opposition candidate from the same party.[90]\n\nIn the November 1997 general election, Flores faced National party candidate Nora G\u00fanera de Melgar, the wife of General Juan Alberto Melgar Castro, who seized power in a 1975 coup which removed then president Oswaldo L\u00f3pez Arellano after his bananagate bribery scandal with United Fruit Company.\n\nFlores defeated his opponent by a 10% margin of 195,418 votes out of a total of 1,885,388 votes cast. G\u00fanera de Melgar's campaign was aided by the assistance Dick Morris, a rival political consultant and also a political adviser to Bill Clinton. Morris claimed he had no knowledge of Carville's involvement with his opponent until after the election.[87]\n\nIn October 1998, Hurricane Mitch devastated Honduras, and post-hurricane reconstruction efforts resulted in international development banks' renegotiation of much of Honduras' external debt in exchange for structural adjustment policies. After selling state-owned airports and energy companies, Flores unsuccessfully attempted to privatize Hondutel, the state-owned telephone utility, and when that effort failed, the International Monetary Fund froze the distribution of loans and demanded that the government further accelerate its privatization programs.[91]\n\nEcuador, 1998 [ edit ]\n\nJamil Mahuad Witt\n\nIn 1998, Carville helped to craft a successful strategy to elect Jamil Mahuad Witt as President of Ecuador. Mahuad, an Ecuadorian-born attorney, earned a Master of Public Administration from Harvard Kennedy School, where he was Mason Fellow.[92] He was also a US State Department-sponsored Fulbright Fellow,[93] who lectured in ethics and politics at several universities.\n\nMahuad was elected Mayor of Quito in the 1990s before retaining the services of Carville to help him win the Ecuadorian presidency,[94][95][96] in a campaign in which Mahuad touted his educational background at Harvard Kennendy School.\n\nIn the wake of an economic crisis from falling oil prices and stagnant economic growth, Mahuad decreed a state of emergency, and embarked on austerity measures to stifle rampant inflation, including sales tax and gasoline tax increases, freezing bank account withdrawals, and the dollarization of the economy which included the sudden voiding and invalidation of the sucre, Ecuador's currency since 1884.[97] In January 2000, Mahuad was forced from office in a military coup following demonstrations by Ecuadorians.[98] Mahuad fled to exile in the United States. In 2014, an Ecuadorian court convicted Mahuad, in absentia, of embezzlement during his time in office, and sentenced him to twelve years in prison.[99] Interpol also issued a warrant for his arrest. [100]\n\nPanama, 1998 [ edit ]\n\nErnesto Perez Balladares\n\nIn 1998, the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) party in Panama retained Carville as their main adviser to help re-elect then term-limited President Ernesto P\u00e9rez Balladares during an election where opposition figures suggested that Perez Balladares was hoping to convey the impression that the Clinton Administration in the United States secretly favored a second term for him.[101] P\u00e9rez Balladares, who attended college in the United States at the University of Notre Dame before attaining his Master's at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania,[102] reformed Panama's Labor Code, privatized Panama's telephone and electrical utilities, and ushered Panama into the World Trade Organization during his tenure.[103] Despite massive spending by the PRD, including the hiring of Carville to craft an effective political strategy, the proposal to lift his term limitation was defeated by a margin of almost 2 to 1.[104]\n\nEhud Barak with PLO chairman Yasser Arafat, and United States president Bill Clinton\n\nAt the suggestion of President Clinton, who had grown frustrated with Benjamin Netanyahu's intransigence in the peace process, Carville, along with colleagues Bob Shrum, a speechwriter for President Clinton, and Stanley Greenberg, consulted in late 1998 and early 1999 for Labor Party candidate Ehud Barak to help him prepare for the 1999 prime ministerial election.\n\nCarville and colleagues endeavored to help Barak seize control of the daily debate, and boost his struggling challenge to incumbent head-of-state Binyamin Netanyahu. Short declarative sentences, sound bites, rapid response, repetition, wedge issues, ethnic exploitation, nightly polling, negative research, searing attack advertisements on television, all familiar tools of American politics, arrived on the Israeli political scene during the election, as a part of what Netanyahu's director of communications, David Bar-Illan characterized as an Americanization of the election, and Netanyahu advisers implying White House meddling in an Israeli election.[105] Barak won election by a double digit margin and served for over two years, before calling a special prime ministerial election in 2001.\n\nArgentina, 1999 [ edit ]\n\nCarville consulted for Buenos Aires Province Governor Eduardo Duhalde in his 1999 run for president of Argentina as the Justicialist Party nominee. Carville remarked in May, 1999 that U.S. Ambassador to Argentina James Cheek introduced him to Duhalde in January, 1998.[106] Carville's consulting fee ran $30,000 per month, in 1999 US dollars, added to a percentage of campaign advertisements, plus first class airfare and hotel expenses.[107]\n\nDuhalde spent much of the campaign embroiled in a power struggle with his own party and incumbent President Carlos Menem who was barely dissuaded from running for a third term despite constitutional term limits, and a series of court rulings against him. The contest of campaigns was rather flat; there were no presidential debates, nor large campaign rallies, nor were any major changes in course promised by the frontrunner candidates.[108] Duhalde emphasized his law and order credentials as a campaign theme. One television advertisement for Duhalde's campaign depicted him walking in the woods alone, talking to himself, and bemoaning all the political enemies plotting against him.[109] Carville clashed with Duhalde's public relations team leading up to the election, which lead to his departure.[110]\n\nAgainst an economic backdrop of the Argentine Great Depression, Duhalde lost the October 1999 general election to Radical Civic Union party candidate Fernando de la R\u00faa who enjoyed the strategy and advice of U.S. American political consult Dick Morris (like Carville, also a former consultant to President Bill Clinton). De la R\u00faa would later resign during the December 2001 riots, and the Argentine Congress appointed the governor of San Luis Province Adolfo Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1 as president. When Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1 also resigned, Congress appointed Duhalde, who would serve as president of Argentina from January, 2002 through May, 2003.\n\nBolivia, 2002 [ edit ]\n\nGonzalo \"Goni\" Sanchez de Lozada in 2003\n\nIn 2002, through his firm Greenberg Carville Shrum (GCS), Carville strategized in Bolivia on behalf of Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNR) party presidential candidate Gonzalo \"Goni\" S\u00e1nchez de Lozada. The son of a political exile, S\u00e1nchez de Lozada spent his early years in Iowa, studied at the University of Chicago,[111] and spoke Spanish with a midwestern American accent.[112][113] Sanchez de Lozada served as Bolivian president in the mid 1990s, and had a record of using shock therapy, economic liberalization, and privatization. In his 2002 election campaign, he faced the first serious challenge to the hegemony of the established Bolivian political parties in the form of Evo Morales and his left-wing populist and indigenist Movement for Socialism (MAS) party.\n\nCarville helped Sanchez de Lozada run a campaign playbook with a slick media campaign under the slogan \"Bolivia s\u00ed puede\" (\"Yes, Bolivia can\") that featured negative attack ads on his opponents, particularly against Cochabamba mayor Manfred Reyes Villa. In one campaign advertisement, Reyes Villa was blamed for rampant diarrhea in the city's poor children.[114]\n\nSanchez de Lozada garnered a plurality of votes, 22.46%, against Evo Morales second place finish at 20.94%, before coming to power in August 2002 in a coalition government formed with two other political parties.[115] Lozada resigned in October, 2003 and fled to exile in the United States following the 2003 Bolivian Gas Conflict. Carville's work for Lozada in Bolivia was portrayed in the 2005 documentary film Our Brand Is Crisis, which inspired the 2015 narrative form film Our Brand is Crisis.\n\nVenezuela, 2003 [ edit ]\n\nHugo Ch\u00e1vez tours the USS Yorktown cruiser in March, 2002, at Port Willemstad, Cura\u00e7ao, Netherlands Antilles during the 43rd annual UNITAS multi-national naval exercise.\n\nIn early 2003, Carville worked in Venezuela as an advisor to Venezuelan business interests that previously led an economically devastating strike in the spring of 2002 by managers of the national oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), in an effort to destabilize the government of leftist president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez.[116] In the aftermath of an unsuccessful coup attempt in April 2002, the group sought Carville's assistance in displacing Ch\u00e1vez from office.[117][118][119][120] In a September, 2006 interview that touched on the topic, Carville remarked: \"I've worked in Venezuela and I would be very reluctant to call Ch\u00e1vez a democrat.\"[121]\n\nAfghanistan 2009 [ edit ]\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi with Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani\n\nAfghan presidential candidate Ashraf Ghani hired Carville as a campaign advisor in July 2009. Ghani, who renounced his US Citizenship in order to run for Presidency in Afghanistan,[122] attended high school in the United States in Lake Oswego, Oregon, during the late 1960s, earned his master's degree from Columbia University in 1977, was a Fulbright Fellow in the United States who taught at UC Berkeley, and Johns Hopkins University in the 1980s, and worked as an economist at the Washington, DC-based World Bank in the 1990s.[123]\n\nGhani and Carville met in Washington in the spring of 2009 through mutual friends.[124] Carville would not say whether he was paid to advise Ghani,[124] whereas Ghani claimed Carville volunteered his time.[125] Carville remarked at the time that the 2009 Afghan presidential election is \"probably the most important election held in the world in a long time,\" and he called his new job \"probably the most interesting project I have ever worked in my life.\"[126] When asked about similarities between politics in Afghanistan and politics in Louisiana, Carville responded: \"Yeah, I felt a little bit at home, to be honest with you.\" Carville's objective was to help prevent one of Ghani's opponents, Hamid Karzai from garnering a majority of votes, to force the election into a second round.[127] Ghani garnered just 2.94% of the vote, with Kazai finishing just shy of a 50% majority. After a cancelled run-off election Karzai became president.\n\nColombia 2010 [ edit ]\n\nIn 2010, Carville worked as senior advisor to elect presidential candidate Juan Manuel Santos in Colombia.[128][129] The Colombian-born Santos attended the University of Kansas for undergraduate studies from 1969 to 1973, graduating with a degree in economics and business. He returned to the U.S. as Fulbright visiting fellow at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in 1981,[130] and also earned a master's degree from Harvard Kennedy School in 1981,[131] and lectured as a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University in 1988.[132]\n\nSantos later joined the Washington, DC-based think tank, the Inter-American Dialogue, and served as Colombia's Minister of Trade,[133] and Minister of Finance and Public Credit of Colombia during the 1990s and early 2000s.[133] In 2006, then President Alvaro Uribe appointed Santos as Colombia's Minister of Defence. Santos supervised the military during a period of political tension and military action targeted at the FARC guerrilla group, including a controversial military raid on Ecuador's border,[134] and extrajudicial assassinations during the \"False positives\" scandal.[135]\n\nCarville played a crucial role for Santos, helping him to analyze voter polls, and crafted a winning strategy,[136][137] that included the night-time distribution of pamphlets under the doors of voters' homes predicting the end of popular social welfare initiatives if Santos wasn't elected.[138]\n\nOn June 20, 2010, after two rounds of voting, Santos was elected as President of Colombia and was inaugurated on 7 August 2010 in the midst of a diplomatic crisis with Venezuela.[139] The U.S. State Department remarked in official communications that it was \"pleased\" with the election of Santos, and praised the \"spirited debate\" before the runoff and Colombia's \"longstanding commitment to democratic principles\".[140] In 2017, Santos acknowledged that his 2010 campaign received illegal payments from Brazilian conglomerate Odebrecht.[141]\n\nArgentina 2015 [ edit ]\n\nCarville acted as advisor for Daniel Scioli's 2007 and 2011's campaigns for the governor of Buenos Aires. He also consulted for his unsuccessful presidential campaign in 2015.[142] The election featured allegations of vote-buying, when Scioli's Front for Victory party was alleged to have distributed sacks with bottles of cooking oil, pasta and flour to Buenos Aires voters in exchange for their votes.[143] Scioli was defeated in a November, 2015 runoff election.\n\nJohn Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign [ edit ]\n\nJohn Kerry at a campaign rally in Minneapolis on October 21, 2004\n\nIn September, 2004, after conversations with Bill Clinton, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry engaged the assistance of Carville as an informal adviser to his 2004 presidential campaign.[144] Rival political consultant Dick Morris speculated at the time that Carville and Greenberg, instrumental participants in the Clinton's political machine, infiltrated Kerry's campaign as a way to engineer his defeat and clear a path for Hillary Clinton to run in 2008.[145][146] In the aftermath of Kerry's loss, Carville and colleagues Stanley Greenberg, as well as journalist Bob Shrum, sought to place blame on external events, including news media coverage of the Iraq War, the October, 2004 Osama bin Laden video, as well as Bush's focus on cultural issues.[147]\n\n2000s [ edit ]\n\nCarville after delivering a speech at a Western Association of Venture Capitalists meeting in December 2009\n\nCarville co-hosted CNN's Crossfire along with associate Paul Begala from 2002 until the show's cancellation in 2005. Carville was a CNN contributor until parting ways with the network in 2013.[148] The following year, Carville joined Fox News Channel as a contributor.[149]\n\nIn 2005, Carville taught a semester of the course \"Topics in American Politics\" at Northern Virginia Community College. Among the guests he had come speak to the class were Al Hunt, Mark Halperin, Senator George Allen, George Stephanopoulos, Karl Strubel, Stan Greenberg, Tony Blankley, representatives from the Motion Picture Association of America, and James Fallows.\n\nIn 2006, Carville became a host on a sports radio show, 60/20 Sports, on XM Satellite Radio, with Luke Russert, son of NBC journalist Tim Russert. The show was an in-depth look at the culture of sports based on the difference in ages of the two hosts.\n\nDuring 2006 mid-terms, then Democratic National Committee chair Howard Dean mobilized a Fifty-state strategy. Democrats won control of both houses of Congress for the first time since the 1994 election. For the first time since the creation of the Republican party in 1854, no Republican captured any House, Senate, or Gubernatorial seat previously held by a Democrat.[150] Notwithstanding, after the election, on November 15, 2006, Carville blasted Dean's leadership as \"Rumsfeldian in its incompetence,\" called for Dean's ouster as DNC Chair and his replacement with Harold Ford Jr., and claimed that, with a conventional strategy of piling money solely into close races, Democrats could have picked up as many as 50 House seats, roughly 20 more than they won that year.[151][152] In late November 2006, Carville proposed a truce of sorts.[153]\n\nCarville was the executive producer of the 2006 film All the King's Men, starring Sean Penn and Anthony Hopkins, which is loosely based on the life of Louisiana Governor Huey Long.\n\nIn January, 2009, Carville predicted the execution of a peace agreement between Israel and Syria in the following 18 months, noting it would be a foreign policy priority for the incoming Obama administration.[154] For several months in 2010, then Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu participated in secret, American-brokered discussions with Syria toward a peace treaty based on a full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights. The Arab Spring ensued the following year, and the treaty never came to fruition.[155]\n\nOn March 4, 2009, Politico reported that Carville, Paul Begala, and Rahm Emanuel were the architects of the Democratic Party's strategy to cast conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh as the face of the Republican Party.[156] Carville was particularly critical of Limbaugh for saying he wanted Barack Obama to \"fail\".\n\nCarville was a regular contributor with Stan Greenberg to the weekly Carville-Greenberg Memo at The National Memo.\n\nHillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign [ edit ]\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton on the stump in New Hampshire in June 2007\n\nCarville advised Hillary Clinton during her 2008 presidential campaign. In remarks about then rival candidate, Senator Barack Obama, Carville declared in 2007 that Barack Obama was the Democratic candidate \"most likely to explode or implode.\"[157]\n\nOn March 22, 2008, Carville compared New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, who had just endorsed Barack Obama for the nomination, to Judas Iscariot, calling this \"an act of betrayal.\" Carville remarked, \"Mr. Richardson's endorsement came right around the anniversary of the day when Judas sold out for 30 pieces of silver, so I think the timing is appropriate, if ironic,\" referring to Holy week. Richardson had served President Bill Clinton as his Energy Secretary and Ambassador to the United Nations so Carville believed Richardson owed an endorsement to Senator Clinton. Carville also claimed Richardson assured many in the Clinton campaign that he would at least remain neutral and abstain from taking sides.[158] Richardson denied Carville's account, arguing that he had not made any promises to remain neutral. Richardson claims that his decision to endorse Obama was \"clinched\" by his speech on race relations following the swirl of controversy surrounding Obama's former pastor Jeremiah Wright.[159] Carville went on to note, \"I doubt if Governor Richardson and I will be terribly close in the future,\" Carville said,[160] but \"I've had my say...I got one in the wheelhouse and I tagged it.\"\n\nEven as Clinton's campaign began to lose steam, Carville remained both loyal and positive in his public positions, rarely veering off message and stoutly defending the candidate. However, on May 13, 2008 a few hours before the primary in West Virginia, Carville remarked to an audience at Furman University in South Carolina, \"I'm for Senator Clinton but I think the great likelihood is that Obama will be the nominee.\"[161] The moment marked a shift from his previous and often determinedly optimistic comments about the state of Clinton's campaign.\n\nAfter Barack Obama's clear lead for victory in the Democratic presidential campaign on June 3, James Carville said he was ready to open up his wallet to help Obama build a political war chest to take on John McCain in November.[citation needed]\n\n2010s [ edit ]\n\nCarville and former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin at a 2016 Polticon forum\n\nCarville was retained by Palantir Technologies as a paid adviser in 2011, and was instrumental in bringing about Palantir's collaboration with the New Orleans Police Department to quietly deploy predictive policing software in New Orleans.[162][163]\n\nCarville has criticized Obama's political style and demeanor over the years. On November 18th, 2010, Carville spoke to an audience at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast and remarked: \"If Hillary gave up one of her balls and gave it to Obama, he'd have two.\"[164] Carville made a similar remark to political journalist Eleanor Clift during the midst of the primaries in May, 2008, insinuating that Hillary Clinton was a tougher candidate, remarking: \"If she gave him one of her cojones, they'd both have two.\"[165]\n\nIn November 2013, in light of President Barack Obama's declining approval poll numbers, Carville commented \"I think the best thing he can do is take a toke on the mayor of Toronto's crack pipe, because his numbers are about 48.\"[166]\n\nOn October 21, 2018, Carville participated with Fox News pundit Tucker Carlson at the 2018 PoltiCon in Los Angeles in \"A conversation with Eddie Izzard\", an event chaired by the British comedian.[167]\n\nCarville joined the faculty of Louisiana State University's Manship School of Mass Communication in January 2018. His work at the Manship School was supported by philanthropic gifts.[168] He has also lectured in political science at Tulane University.[169]\n\nIn 2019, political pundit Mark Halperin consulted with Carville for his upcoming book, How to Beat Trump: America's Top Political Strategists on What It Will Take. Carville was asked what he would tell Halperin's sexual assault victims, who have expressed disappointment and outrage that so many top Democrats were willing to talk with someone accused of such serious allegations, and remarked: \"I know he's been accused by a lot of people and lost his job. The guy called me and asked me to speak to him on a topic that I obviously care about. And I spoke to him.\"[170]\n\n2020s [ edit ]\n\nMichael Bennet's 2020 presidential campaign [ edit ]\n\nCarville campaigning with 2020 presidential candidate Michael Bennet in New Hampshire\n\nIn January 2020, Carville endorsed Colorado Senator Michael Bennet's ultimately unsuccessful campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination.[171] Carville appeared on stage with Bennet leading up to the 2020 New Hampshire Democratic presidential primary at his political events in the state. Carville remarked of Bennet during the campaign season: \"This is John Kennedy recloned, you can't get any better than this guy!\"[172] Bennet, who leaned hard on Carville's endorsement, garnered 963 votes in New Hampshire, or 0.3% of 300,022 total Democratic ballots cast in a year of record-shattering turnout.[173][174][175]\n\n2020 election cycle [ edit ]\n\nCarville has also entered the podcast business, and, along with Al Hunt hosts 2020 Politics War Room, which purports to offer \"a backstage pass to impeachment and the 2020 Election.\"[176] He continues to make frequent appearances with Brian Williams in MSNBC cable news programming to comment on the 2020 Democratic debates, caucuses and primaries, and the trajectory of the 2020 Democratic nomination and general election.\n\nIn February 2020, Carville suggested jettisoning the Democratic presidential primaries and caucuses, letting House Speaker Nancy Pelosi select the Democratic Party's presidential and vice-presidential candidates, and suggested Mitt Romney should \"resign from the Senate to save the Democratic Party's ass, and run our convention.\" Carville further added he might cast a write in vote for Nancy Pelosi when he votes in Louisiana.[176]\n\nIn February 2020 media appearances and interviews, against a backdrop of presidential candidate Bernie Sanders' rise in the polls, Carville expressed his displeasure at the prospect of Sanders being nominated, branded Sanders as a \"communist\" and pejoratively labeled Sanders' base of support as a \"cult\", warning of the \"end of days\" if Sanders were to win the Democratic nomination.[177][178] Carville used his media appearances surrounding the dustup to rail against the ascendance of progressive populist Democratic policy positions such as student loan debt forgiveness[179] and \"people voting from jail cells.\"[180] Carville also decried banning hydraulic fracking for shale gas.[181]\n\nIn November 2020, Carville predicted that the result of the presidential election would be known by 10 p.m. on election day. After the Associated Press took an additional four days to declare the winner, Politico named Carville's prediction among \"the most audacious, confident and spectacularly incorrect prognostications about the year\".[182]\n\nPennsylvania Senate election, 2022 [ edit ]\n\nIn 2022, Carville led the \"Penn Progress\" Super Pac,[183][184] which spent the entirety of its funds in support of Rep. Conor Lamb's bid for the U.S. Senate seat vacated by retiring senator Pat Toomey.[185] Lamb worked closely with Carville's SuperPac, and participated in donor calls Carville arranged. [186][187]\n\nCarville's Super PAC bankrolled TV ads which sought to portray one of Lamb's primary opponents, Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman as a \"self-described democratic socialist.\" Within a day of airing, PolitiFact and Factcheck.org called the attack ad false,[188] The Philadelphia Inquirer commented that Fetterman had never actually described himself that way,[189] the ABC affiliate in Philadelphia, stopped broadcasting the ad,[190] and Senator Elizabeth Warren called on Lamb to disavow it.[191] Echoing a fanciful attack by Pennsylvania Republican Party chairman Val DiGiorgio, Carville himself re-tweeted news coverage on Fetterman being labeled a \"silver spoon socialist.\"[192][193]\n\nU.S. Presidential election, 2024 [ edit ]\n\nFollowing U.S. President Joe Biden's poor performance during the June 27, 2024 debate, Carville was among those who called for Biden to end his bid for re-election.[194] In an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on July 1, Carville stated, among other things, \"The country wants something new. Let them have it.\"[195]\n\nCarville's biographical documentary film Carville: Winning Is Everything, Stupid!, which debuted at the 2024 Telluride Film Festival before receiving a theatrical release on October 11, 2024, includes the 18 month period where he persuaded Biden to end his re-election.[196]\n\nPublic speaking [ edit ]\n\nIn 2004, The New York Times noted that Carville was making more than 100 speeches per year to various audiences, including business groups, colleges and universities and Democratic Party fundraising events. Charles Lewis, executive director at the Center for Public Integrity, a Washington research group, remarked that \"No political consultant has carved a space as unique as his.\" Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, said at the time: \"He's become a commodity of himself by design. He's a walking conglomerate.\" Joe Lockhart, a former press secretary to Bill Clinton, characterized Carville as \"a multimedia corporation, and he's been smart about it. He is a model of the future. This could not have happened pre-1992 when campaign consultants were viewed by a small audience. Now they are public celebrities.\"[197] Carville was noted to have been represented exclusively by the Washington Speakers Bureau, with a speaker's fee of $20,500 in 2004 to get him to the podium for an hour, plus first-class expenses and top accommodations.[198]\n\nCommercial endorsements and advertisements [ edit ]\n\nCarville had an array of commercial endorsements, and starred in print media and television advertisements for leading consumer brands including Coca-Cola, Little Debbie snacks, Maker's Mark bourbon, Heineken beer, Alka-Seltzer antacid, American Express credit cards, Nike shoes, the Cotton Council, and Ariba software.[197]\n\nIn 2000, through Bob Chlopak's and Peter Schechter's Chlopak, Leonard, Schechter & Associates (CLS), a Washington, DC-based public relations firm, Carville enjoyed a sponsorship with Playboy media and Captain Morgan rum, which included a trip to Hugh Hefner's Playboy mansion.[199]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nCarville is married to political consultant Mary Matalin, who worked for Republican George H. W. Bush on his 1992 presidential reelection campaign. Carville and Matalin were married in New Orleans in October 1993. They have two daughters. In 2008, Carville and Matalin relocated their family from Virginia to New Orleans.[200]\n\nCarville has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and has spoken publicly about ADHD for organizations like Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.[201][better source needed]\n\nCarville sold his house in Uptown New Orleans in May 2021. He temporarily relocated to Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, until moving back into New Orleans in June of 2021. Carville still owns his house in Bay St. Louis and frequently visits. In many of his appearances on cable news, he can be seen in his living room there.[202]\n\nPolitics War Room with James Carville & Al Hunt podcast [ edit ]\n\nIn 2019, Carville and Al Hunt launched the podcast.[203]\n\nBooks [ edit ]\n\nPolitics\n\nChildren's fiction\n\nLu and the Swamp Ghost (2004) with co-author Patricia McKissack and illustrator David Catrow\n\nFilm and television appearances [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]",

Hunter wants American citizens to see the version of his father that he knows \u2014 scrappy and in command of the facts \u2014 rather than the stumbling, ageing president citizens saw during the debate on June 27.\n\nThis person said that at least one of Biden's grandchildren expressed interest in getting more involved with the campaign, perhaps by talking with influencers on social media.\n\nAlso watch | Hunter Biden convicted in gun trial: Will the conviction impact Joe Biden's presidential race? \u00d7 Another person familiar with developments told the publication that the entire family was united.\n\n'Biden shouldn't run for president'\n\nAn increasing number of voters, including Democrats, do not think that Biden should be running for president following his debate with Trump, a survey from CBS News showed.\n\nAccording to the survey, most voters who said that Biden should not run have given the reason being his campaigning and his effectiveness in office, along with his age.\n\nTrump, by contrast, finds a wide view among Republicans that he should be running, the survey added.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)",

        "text": "Secretary Antony J. Blinken at a Conversation on U.S. Foreign Policy at the Brookings Institution\nSecretary Antony J. Blinken at a Conversation on U.S. Foreign Policy at the Brookings Institution\n\nMS ROUSE: Good morning, everyone. I\u2019m Cecilia Rouse. I\u2019m the president of the Brookings Institution. Thank you all who are joining us here today in Falk Auditorium and to the many more who are joining in online. It is my absolute pleasure to welcome you to a special conversation with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken for a wide-ranging discussion of the challenges and opportunities for American diplomacy around the world.\n\nTony, thank you for \u2013 so much for making the time to be with us this morning. We are so honored to welcome you back to Brookings. Secretary Blinken has served as the 71st U.S. Secretary of State since 2021. He has had a long and distinguished career in public service, beginning at the State Department during the Clinton Administration. Over the years, he has held important roles at the National Security Council, as staff director of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee under then-Senator Joe Biden, as national security advisor to then-Vice President Biden, and as deputy secretary of state during the Obama administration. We are especially grateful to engage with Secretary Blinken at this time of immense international challenges and just ahead of the 75th NATO summit, to be held here in Washington next week.\n\nThere is a lot of ground to cover in the foreign policy landscape: the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, strategic competition with China, and the influence of our very own elections this fall. In this discussion, we look forward to getting the Secretary\u2019s perspective on how the U.S. can use diplomacy as well as other tools to build a more peaceful world and address threats to democracy and stability.\n\nTo help us navigate these issues in the next 45 minutes, I\u2019m delighted to have Suzanne Maloney moderate the discussion. Suzanne is the vice president and director of the Foreign Policy program at Brookings. As a former advisor to senior department officials and a member of the policy planning staff, Suzanne knows well the challenges that the Secretary must confront.\n\nSo before we begin, I would like to recognize that today\u2019s event is part of Brookings\u2019 long-running Alan and Jane Batkin International Leaders Forum run by our Foreign Policy program. This program brings together world leaders and officials at Brookings for the thoughtful exchange of ideas on critical policy issues. Please note that we are streaming live and on the record. You can share your thoughts via social media using the hashtag #foreignpolicy. Following the conversation, we will have a brief Q&A and our staff will pass around mics in the room. For those viewing online, please send your questions to events@brookings.edu. Thank you, and I hand things over to Suzanne.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Thanks. (Applause.)\n\nMS MALONEY: Thanks, Cece, and thanks to all those of you in the room for waiting patiently as we got things underway here this morning, and especially to all those of you online. Secretary, it\u2019s wonderful to have you back here at Brookings again.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank you.\n\nMS MALONEY: It\u2019s been a little over a year since we last saw you in our halls, and you\u2019ve been awfully busy since that time. The United States is playing a critical role in coordinating with partners and allies around the world and dealing with two major wars, navigating a complex \u2013and at times turbulent relationship with China, and contending with a host of crises from Haiti, Sudan, North Korea and the South China Sea. I hope we\u2019ll have an opportunity to touch on some of these specific issues as we go.\n\nBut I really did want to start off at the 50,000-foot level around the state of the international system and the role of America in the world today. You and I both came of age at a time when the Cold War was ending, and we have spent the past 30 years at a \u2013 in a period that\u2019s been marked by many challenges: by horrific attacks on the American homeland, two major wars in the Middle East. But the world has also experienced significant progress during that period: lifting of large swaths of humanity out of poverty, reduction in the frequency and intensity of interstate conflict. And we seem to be building an order where cooperation and liberalization were bolstered by both economic interdependence and the waning of some adversarial ideologies.\n\nAnd yet, as you have previewed in a number of the speeches and remarks that you\u2019ve made since taking office, we\u2019re also now facing something of an inflection point. The Cold \u2013 post-Cold War era is giving way to something new. Can you describe the strategic landscape today and how the United States and the Biden administration have sought to address this complicated new era that we are finding ourselves in?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, thank you, Suzanne, and thanks to everyone for being here this morning. It\u2019s so good to see so many friends, colleagues, familiar faces, in this place where I\u2019ve spent a little bit of time over the past 30 years. It\u2019s always good to be back at Brookings.\n\nSo I think you\u2019re exactly right: we are at an inflection point. We are at a point where the post-Cold War era is over and there is a race, a competition on, to shape what comes next. We see that in the emergence or reemergence of great power competition. We see that in so many global challenges that have come to the fore and are interconnected. There\u2019s a greater multiplicity and complexity of challenges and interconnectedness of challenges than any time since I\u2019ve been doing this in the last 30 years. And the question is: How are we going to approach them? How are we going to try to shape them?\n\nWe come into this with a couple of premises. One is that when our country is not engaged, when we\u2019re not leading, then either one of two things. Either someone else is, and probably not in a way that advances our own interests and values, or maybe, just as bad, no one is, and then you tend to have vacuums that are more likely to be filled by bad things before they\u2019re filled with good things. So there\u2019s a premium on our engagement and on our leadership.\n\nBut the flip side is this: More than at any time since I\u2019ve been doing this this last 30 years, there\u2019s also a premium on finding new ways to cooperate, to collaborate, to communicate. Because we do not have \u2013 as powerful as we are \u2013 the capacity to meet these challenges effectively alone. And so we\u2019ve worked very hard to re-energize, to reinvigorate, and in many ways to reimagine these alliances and partnerships.\n\nI think, Suzanne, if you step back and look at the road that we\u2019ve traveled just over the last three and a half years, it\u2019s very easy to forget where we were three and a half years ago. Obviously, we had a global health crisis and a country that was quite literally paralyzed by COVID. We had an economic recession, the worst since the Great Depression \u2013 and not just here, of course, but globally. We had alliances and partnerships that were deeply damaged and frayed. We had China, that was moving forward in ways that were not being effectively addressed.\n\nAnd I think what we\u2019ve seen in the last few years is an extraordinary re-emergence here from \u2013 obviously from COVID, and putting that in the rearview mirror. Our own economy now, by far the most successful economy of the major democracies. GDP growth exceeds that of the next three countries combined. Major investments made \u2013 which I\u2019ll come to in one second \u2013 that are making a powerful difference; and, as I look around the world and go around the world, alliances, partnerships that are much stronger than they were just three and a half years ago.\n\nBasically, as we\u2019ve looked at it, we wanted to do two things, and the President\u2019s been determined to do two things: Make these investments in ourselves, which we\u2019ve done; but also make these investments in our alliances and partnerships, which we\u2019ve done. And the basic idea is when you do that, as we\u2019ve done, you can deal with the multiplicity of challenges from a position of strength, not a position of weakness. We live in a very dangerous world. We\u2019ve had all of these trends that have emerged \u2013 not just in the last few years, but over the last couple of decades, this move from the post-Cold War era into a new era, where of course you have extraordinary forces moving at a rapidity that we\u2019ve never seen \u2013 technology, information technology. And it creates, I think, for a lot of people a sense of destabilization, not knowing where your North Star is.\n\nBut in order to deal with that, doing it from a position of strength, investing at home, investing in our partnerships \u2013 that\u2019s the foundation that we\u2019ve set, and I think if you go through each of the different problem sets that we\u2019re facing, you can see how approaching them from a position of strength actually makes us more effective in delivering results and doing what the American people need us to do for them.\n\nMS MALONEY: I want to drill down a little bit on that point. We\u2019ve had on this stage both National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, and more recently Deputy National Security Advisor Daleep Singh, both times in conversations with Brookings economists, both times talking about industrial policy, about economic statecraft. And that has been a major element of the administration\u2019s approach to so many of the challenges that we face around the world. Can you tell us a little bit about how it is that the foreign policy bureaucracy has now really taken on economics as a core element of both strength at home and strength abroad?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, we\u2019re seized with this because we have to be, for two reasons: One, yes, I see this every place I go. Our strength at home manifests itself directly and clearly in our strength abroad. As country after country has seen the kinds of investments we\u2019ve made in ourselves \u2013 whether it\u2019s in our own infrastructure, to make sure that our roads, our bridges, our communications are leading the way; when they look at what we\u2019ve done with the CHIPS and Science Act, the investment in the most critical technology for the 21st century; when they look at what we\u2019ve done with the IRA, which despite some early challenges now I think is seen incredibly positively by most countries around the world; the investments we\u2019re making in the kind of technology and the kind of manufacturing that\u2019s going to dominate 21st-century economies \u2013 that is seen as a very positive proof point for the United States. And it increases the desire of countries around the world to work with us.\n\nWhat have we seen in the last three and a half years? We\u2019ve seen more foreign direct investment coming into this country than at any time in our history. And in three and a half years, we have more than a trillion dollars in foreign direct investment, which exceeds by almost a quarter of a trillion dollars what we saw in the previous four years. That\u2019s a sign of strength, that\u2019s a sign of attractiveness of the United States.\n\nBut as we\u2019re going around the world, we also have to make sure that we get the flip side right. So one of the challenges that we have right now \u2013 I was in China recently. We have deep concerns, as you know, about China\u2019s overcapacity, trying to export their way out of their own economic challenges, and doing it in a way that saturates our market in critical industries, in critical sectors, where we\u2019re investing right now in goods that are underpriced and designed basically to price out our own manufacturers from these sectors, from these industries \u2013 whether it\u2019s solar panels, whether it\u2019s electric vehicles, electric vehicle batteries, et cetera. Our job, our responsibility is to make sure that we\u2019re defending our workers, defending our industries, and defending our communities. And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing.\n\nBut here\u2019s the difference: It\u2019s one thing when we\u2019re doing this alone. It\u2019s one thing when the United States is carrying that fight as 20, 25 percent of the world\u2019s GDP. When we\u2019re aligned with others, when we\u2019re working with Europeans, when we\u2019re working with Asian partners and other partners, all of whom have some \u2013 are facing some of the same challenges, and all of the sudden we\u2019re aligning 50 or 60 percent of the world\u2019s GDP against this problem, we\u2019re going to be a lot more effective. And that\u2019s the other big thing that I think we\u2019ve seen over the last three and a half years: a much greater alignment, a much greater convergence between us and key partners in Europe, in Asia, and beyond on how to tackle some of these challenges, including some of the challenges posed by China, and of course, the challenges posed by Russia.\n\nMS MALONEY: I do want to come to the question of alliances in just a moment to talk more about the upcoming NATO summit, but I did want to ask you about an issue that is much in the news these days, especially over the course of the past couple of days. Since the debate between President Biden and former President Trump, there has been a sense of strong discussion and lots of views being elicited. You have worked with President Joe Biden for decades. Can you tell us what you think friends and foes around the world should know about American leadership today under President Biden?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, I think what the world knows, the world has experienced over three and a half years \u2013 not one night \u2013 is exactly the kind of leadership that he\u2019s brought to bear on problems that are common for so many countries, particularly so many of the democracies around the world. And as I\u2019ve seen it, again, going around the world, there\u2019s a desire, there\u2019s a thirst for American engagement, for American leadership. Even when we have disagreements with countries, they still want us in this and even leading to try to get to a better place. And they\u2019ve seen a president who has reinvested America \u2013 reinvested America in the world, reinvested in these alliances, in these partnerships, in ways that they seek and want.\n\nIf you look at surveys around the world for what they\u2019re worth, you see again and again and again that confidence in American leadership has gone up dramatically over the last three and a half years. That doesn\u2019t just happen. It\u2019s the product of choices. It\u2019s the product of policies that we pursue. It\u2019s the product of our engagement. And they see President Biden having led the way in all of those different areas and in ways that are bringing people together and focused in the same way on the challenges that we have before us and that are common to so many other countries.\n\nSo what I\u2019m \u2013 what I\u2019m seeing, what I\u2019m hearing is, again, people are looking at the last three and a half years. They\u2019re looking at policies. They\u2019re looking at policy choices. And for the most part, they like the choices and the policies that this president is pursuing.\n\nMS MALONEY: Well, as we\u2019ve talked about, alliances are critical. The NATO summit is coming up in just a week, celebrating 75 years of that Alliance, and we\u2019ll do it here in Washington. But there are also real questions about the future of NATO, about the place of Ukraine. And this administration has done an amazing job, I think, in foreseeing the crisis that was to come, mobilizing friends and allies around the world; but we are at a point where the Ukrainians don\u2019t appear to be making progress on the battlefield. The war appears to be ground to something of a standstill in terms of territory lost and gained. And the Ukrainians themselves are obviously quite frustrated about their \u2013 the level of assistance that they\u2019ve received from the West \u2013 grateful, but also frustrated.\n\nAnd there was an interview yesterday in which President Volodymyr Zelenskyy talked about the sense that he has that Ukraine and the West have different understandings of what victory means. Can you give us a sense of what you see as victory, what the NATO Alliance is prepared to commit to do in terms of ensuring that there is, in fact, a victory in Ukraine that preserves Ukrainian sovereignty and that positions the West in an advantageous way vis-\u00e0-vis Russia?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Sure. And let\u2019s remember where we started, where we were \u2013 again, very important and easy to forget. In February of 2022, as the Russians attacked Ukraine, the real fear, the real concern was that they would succeed in their objective. And remember what Putin\u2019s objective was: It was to literally erase Ukraine from the map, to end its future as an independent country, to subsume it into the greater Russia. That hasn\u2019t happened and will not happen, and that\u2019s because of two things. It\u2019s because, of course, of the extraordinary courage and resilience of Ukrainians, but it\u2019s also because 50 countries, more than 50 countries, came together \u2013 led by the United States \u2013 in support of Ukraine, in its defense. So that\u2019s already a huge success, because given where we were and given where this could have gone, where people thought it would go, it hasn\u2019t gone there and it\u2019s not going to go there.\n\nBut as we look ahead, I think we have to focus on, yes, this question: What is success? And for me, for us, I think success is very clear. It\u2019s a Ukraine that is a strong, successful country, increasingly integrated with the West, and a country that can stand on its own feet militarily, economically, democratically. And we have the policies in place to make it \u2013 to make sure that that\u2019s exactly what happens.\n\nMilitarily, yes, of course, Ukraine has to deal with the ongoing aggression right now. And again, we have so many countries that continue to rally to its side, to make sure that it has what it needs, when it needs it to continue to ward off the Russian aggression. But it\u2019s also critical that Ukraine develop the capability to deter and defend against aggression going forward over many years. President Biden led the way in getting now more than 30 countries to agree to negotiate bilateral security agreements with Ukraine over a decade.\n\nAnd these agreements \u2013 now, I think nearly 20 have actually been negotiated and signed, including by the President and President Zelenskyy just a few weeks ago in Italy on the margins of the G7 \u2013 these are long-term commitments to helping Ukraine develop a strong deterrent and defense capacity. They also tell Vladimir Putin that he can\u2019t outwait Ukraine, he can\u2019t outwait all of Ukraine\u2019s partners. At the same time, Ukraine is developing its own defense industrial base in a way that will enable it to help provide for itself.\n\nAnd we\u2019re trying to drive private sector investment into Ukraine to make sure that its economy can grow and thrive. We\u2019ve already seen through the Black Sea that Ukraine is exporting as much as it was before February of 2022. There is extraordinary potential in Ukraine\u2019s economy with the right investment. Now, of course, for both its military capacity and its economic capacity, you\u2019ve got to make sure that you have air defenses in place to try to protect the areas in which you\u2019re making investments. We\u2019re driving that. I think you\u2019ll see more news on that in the coming weeks as we get to the NATO summit actually next week.\n\nAnd then finally, standing strongly democratically. The fact that the European Union has opened the accession process with Ukraine is the best guarantee that Ukraine will continue to make the necessary reforms to strengthen and deepen its democracy.\n\nThe end result is a successful country and a country that as it stands on its own in these three areas is the strongest possible rebuke to Vladimir Putin.\n\nMS MALONEY: Well, you\u2019ve obviously done a lot to both rely upon and invest in the transatlantic relationship in managing both the challenge of Ukraine and the larger challenge of Russia. That is a relationship that\u2019s underpinned by a long history, deep mutual interests, but also some sense of shared values. How do you sort of look at the future of that relationship at a time where we do see the rise of right-wing parties and their potential impact on the viability of that Alliance and the effectiveness of that Alliance? We\u2019ve just seen the results of the first round of elections in France, a country that you know well. How concerned are you about changing trends of populism and right-wing governments that might come to the fore in Europe?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: So I think first, again, to put things in focus, just looking at the state of the Alliance itself, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, we\u2019ll have a 75th anniversary party here in Washington in a week\u2019s time. And, of course, we want to celebrate 75 years of the most successful defensive alliance in history. But the main purpose is to focus on the way forward for this Alliance, and I think it\u2019s a very opportune time to remind people of why NATO matters, why it\u2019s so important, and why the investments that we and so many other countries are making in it make a difference.\n\nAnd it really comes back to something very basic that was at the heart of the formation of the Alliance to begin with, and that\u2019s the power of collective defense. The power of Article 5 that says an attack on one is an attack on all is the strongest possible deterrent to aggression, the strongest and most effective way to prevent war in the first place, to avoid conflict in the first place, because any would-be aggressor knows that an attack on any one member means they\u2019re going to have to deal with every member of the Alliance. And so I think reminding all of our citizens of the importance of that and how it\u2019s been so successful for 75 years and how it remains foundational to our security going forward is an important moment.\n\nWe have an Alliance that is bigger than it was just a few years ago, now 32 members \u2013 Finland and Sweden \u2013 that I think for most people that would have been unimaginable just a few years ago. We have an Alliance that\u2019s stronger and has greater investment in it than it\u2019s ever had. We now have 23 countries that are meeting the 2 percent of GDP committed to defense mark that was set at the Wales Summit back in 2014. There were just nine countries in 2021 that met the mark. We\u2019re now at 23, an 18 percent increase in defense investment by the Allies across the Alliance.\n\nAnd also, a thing that \u2013 things that people in this room know very well but that may be a little bit harder to translate for so many of our citizens, a very deliberate and effective effort to make sure that the Alliance in its plans, in its programs, in its posture was effectively positioned to deal with the threats of this moment. And you\u2019ll see more of that at the summit. Those plans are now in place. They\u2019re being resourced and the Alliance is moving to make sure that we have the right defenses across the Alliance where they\u2019re needed, where they\u2019re mattered.\n\nSo this has been a clear trajectory for the last three and a half years. I don\u2019t actually see that changing irrespective of the politics of the moment in Europe. We have very strong allies, very strong partners. We just came from Italy, where Italy has played a major and very effective role in continuing to strengthen the Alliance. I think you\u2019ve heard affirmations from various political parties in Europe of their ongoing commitment to it irrespective of where they\u2019re coming from. So I have confidence that we\u2019ll continue to carry that forward. And the reason, again, for that is because it\u2019s manifestly in the interests of the people that all of us have to represent.\n\nMS MALONEY: I\u2019d like to shift now to China. Obviously, this has been a big focus of the administration\u2019s attention over the course of the past three and a half years. There have been moments of profound tension \u2013 the spy balloon amongst them \u2013 and there have been at least some efforts to try to stabilize the relationship, to invest in improving and strengthening the high-level communication channels that have existed and that have been expanded. What is your sense of how long that relationship can be stabilized? Are we \u2013 we are in a competitive situation with the Chinese. We are going to find moments of friction all over the world. Are we able, in fact, to sustain that kind of stability, or are we likely to cycle through in a kind of erratic phase of crisis to stabilization and back and forth?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: So I think that there\u2019s an expectation, both from the American people and from people around the world, that we\u2019ll do everything we can to manage what is arguably the most complex and consequential relationship of any in the world, manage it responsibly. And that means a few things. It means being very clear and standing up effectively to the areas where we have profound disagreements and would take the world in different directions, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. It also means trying to find wherever we can areas of cooperation where it\u2019s clearly in the interests of our people, Chinese people, people around the world for us to cooperate. We\u2019ve done that too, and I\u2019ll come back to that in a second.\n\nAnd it means not only recognizing but embracing the fact that, yes, we are in an intense competition, an intense competition to shape what the international environment looks like over the coming decades. And for Americans, there\u2019s nothing pejorative about the word \u201ccompetition.\u201d It\u2019s actually at the heart of our own system, provided it\u2019s fair and provided that we approach it effectively.\n\nAnd this comes back to the basic foundational propositions that President Biden had coming in. Whether it\u2019s China, whether it\u2019s any of these other challenges, we\u2019re going to approach it from a position of strength. We\u2019re going to approach it having made investments in ourselves that put us in a much stronger position in dealing with some of the challenges that China poses. We\u2019re going to approach it having reinvested in our alliances and partnerships and having reimagined some of them in order to be genuinely fit for purpose, because we know we\u2019re so much more effective in dealing with these challenges if we\u2019re doing it with others. And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve done.\n\nSo I think we\u2019re in \u2013 we\u2019re at a place now that we were not at three and a half years ago, four years ago, where we can approach this with tremendous confidence, acknowledging the difficulties, acknowledging the challenges, but knowing that we\u2019ve made the right investments in ourselves and that we\u2019ve made the right investments in allies and partners. As I\u2019m looking at Europe, as I\u2019m looking at critical partners in Asia, as I said before, the convergence in the approach \u2013 both the shared recognition of what the challenge is and, increasingly, a shared view on what to do about it \u2013 that\u2019s much greater than it\u2019s ever been.\n\nThere\u2019s something else that\u2019s changed, and I think, again, you\u2019ll see this at the NATO summit. We have four partners from the Indo-Pacific coming to the NATO summit, as they have for the last three years: Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Korea. This is one manifestation and one recognition of something that really is new, which is that increasingly partners in Europe see challenges halfway around the world in Asia as being relevant to them, just as partners in Asia see challenges halfway around the world in Europe as being relevant to them. Prime Minister Kishida put it best in the wake of the Russian aggression against Ukraine. He said what happens in Europe today could happen in Asia tomorrow.\n\nAnd, of course, you see the relationship between Russia and China that has profound repercussions for Europe, when unfortunately you have China making in effect investments in Russia\u2019s defense industrial base in ways that are allowing it to continue the aggression \u2013 not providing arms directly to Russia, but providing all the inputs necessary for it to sustain this war: 70 percent of the machine tools imported by China \u2013 excuse me, by Russia \u2013 coming from China; 90 percent of the microelectronics being imported by Russia coming from China; a massive production now that we\u2019ve seen of tanks, of munitions, of missiles, again, enabled by this defense industrial base despite the important impact that sanctions and export controls have had.\n\nWell, for Europe, that means that one of the \u2013 arguably the biggest security threat that they face, the biggest since the end of the Cold War, China\u2019s playing a role in fueling that. Our partners in Asia, again, understand that if you allow aggression to go unchecked anywhere, it becomes a greater threat everywhere. A would-be aggressor who sees that Russia\u2019s being allowed to proceed with impunity in Europe may get their own ideas in a very different part of the world. So we now have \u2013 and, of course, we have the relationship between Russia and North Korea that\u2019s evolved, as well as with Iran.\n\nSo you now see \u2013 and this has also been a very deliberate part of our policy \u2013 a breaking down of the silos between European alliances, Asian alliances, and even more broadly as we work in countries \u2013 and not just countries \u2013 other partners from other parts of the world. I think that\u2019s going to create a very powerful edifice with these fit-for-purpose coalitions \u2013 different sizes, different shapes, focused on different discrete challenges where different countries may bring specific things to the table. That\u2019s part of the new landscape, the new geometry that we\u2019ve put in place.\n\nMS MALONEY: I want to ask you just a little bit about the \u2013 how you assess Chinese intentions. They\u2019re obviously working to sustain the Russian war effort in Ukraine. They have invested in a huge military \u2013 conventional military buildup as well as a nuclear buildup. You said that the United States is approaching the relationship from a position of strength and confidence, and we\u2019re prepared to compete. Are the Chinese looking to compete or are they looking to dominate?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, look, I think China\u2019s objectives are clear. Over time, over the coming decades, they would like to be the leading country, the dominant country, in the international system militarily, economically, diplomatically. That\u2019s clear. And if their vision for the world actually matched ours or matched many other countries, that would be one thing. But they have a different vision, a different vision of what that future looks like. And so we disagree, and we\u2019re going to compete very vigorously to make sure that we\u2019re the ones who are effectively shaping that future.\n\nNow, again, this is something that\u2019s \u2013 that defies being put on a bumper sticker. You can\u2019t simply put it on the back of your car. The complexity of it, the fact that our countries and so many of our societies are so intertwined, means that, again, there are going to be areas where we\u2019re in vigorous competition. There are areas where we\u2019re clearly going to be contesting. But there are also areas where we\u2019re going to be cooperating because, again, it\u2019s in our mutual interest. And there\u2019s a demand signal from countries around the world.\n\nOne example, and we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ll see where this goes. The number one killer of Americans aged 18 to 49 is fentanyl, a synthetic opioid \u2013 not car accidents, not heart attacks or cancer or guns. Fentanyl. And of course, we know that much of the fentanyl that\u2019s coming into this country is the product of perfectly legal chemicals, or precursors, being manufactured halfway around the world in China, being sent close to our borders in Mexico, and then being diverted and synthesized into an opioid that comes in and kills Americans. Forty percent of Americans \u2013 40 percent, nearly half the country \u2013 knows someone who has died from an opioid overdose. That\u2019s the magnitude of the problem.\n\nSo there are two ways of dealing with this. One is to simply go as hard as we can to stop, disrupt, disable, these networks, the companies that are engaged in this practice. And of course, we\u2019ve done that and we\u2019ll continue to do that. But the other way is to try to elicit greater cooperation, and that\u2019s also exactly what President Biden has done. When he met with President Xi in \u2013 at the end of last year, San Francisco, on the margins of APEC, one of the big subjects was exactly this, fentanyl, synthetic opioids.\n\nAnd one of the propositions that he put to President Xi was this: Look, this problem that we\u2019re facing, where America\u2019s been really the canary in the coal mine, is now spreading to many other parts of the world. Markets are so saturated here that the criminal enterprises that are engaged in this have worked to make markets in other places \u2013 in Asia, in Europe, in Latin America. And you\u2019re going to have more and more countries insisting that you engage responsibly in dealing with this challenge. So whether you want to do something with us or for us almost doesn\u2019t matter because so many others are going to be insisting that you do.\n\nAnd what we\u2019re seen \u2013 and so we want to work together on this, and we\u2019d like to see Chinese leadership on this. And we have seen real progress, not yet sufficient. We have to see over time if it\u2019s sustained and it makes a difference. But in terms of putting forward new regulations, in terms of taking down some of the companies that were illicitly engaged in the diversion of these precursors, these ingredients for fentanyl, prosecuting people who are engaged in this practice, setting up a working group with us to try to make sure that we\u2019re focused on it day in day out \u2013 that\u2019s happened and that\u2019s good. That\u2019s progress.\n\nWe also put together, and this gets back to these coalitions that we\u2019re trying to form precisely because this problem is spreading around the world and more and more countries are concerned about it, as well as with other kinds of drugs \u2013 ketamine, methamphetamines, others that are afflicting so many societies. We know we have to deal with this collectively because it\u2019s the definition of a transnational problem. The United States put together a coalition that now includes more than 150 countries and organizations where we are meeting almost day in day out, developing best practices, developing common approaches, and working to make a difference to stop the flows of these precursors and other things that are going into what is a devastating killer.\n\nSo I cite that only because I think it\u2019s so important that we don\u2019t lose sight of the fact that the complexity of the challenges, the complexity of the relationship, is such that we have to be able to act on it in each of these different areas: the competition, the contestation, the cooperation.\n\nMS MALONEY: Thank you. I want to switch to another part of the world and to another transnational threat, that of terrorism. You\u2019ve spent an awful lot of time in the Middle East since October 7th and the horrific attacks that killed more than 1,200 Israelis and took another 250 Israelis hostage and dual nationals. You\u2019ve been deeply involved with the diplomatic effort to try to bring an end to the war and to bring about the release of those still held against their will in Gaza.\n\nPresident Biden put forward an announcement just about a month ago of a plan that would have \u2013 that would lead to a durable ceasefire over phases and in the release of those remaining hostages. What is your sense of the likelihood that that plan can in fact come to fruition? And if it cannot, is there a plan B?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: I think the proposal that President Biden put forward is achievable, doable, which doesn\u2019t mean it will be achieved, doesn\u2019t mean it will be done, but it can be and it should be. And what we saw after he put out the proposal is quite remarkable. We\u2019ve seen virtually the entire world come together in support of that proposal, country after country standing up, saying, yes, we support this; this is the way forward. This is the way to end the conflict in Gaza. This is the way to get the hostages home. This is the way to put us on a path to more durable security, more durable peace, a better future for Palestinians, for Israelis, and actually for the entire region.\n\nAnd so everyone came together in support with one exception, and that was Hamas, which came back with a \u2013 most charitably a \u201cyes, but,\u201d trying to impose new conditions, moving the line, actually coming back on positions it had already agreed to and trying to \u2013 trying to get more. So we\u2019ve been in an intense effort with the Egyptians, with the Qataris to see if we could close the gaps that Hamas created in not saying yes to a proposal that everyone, including the Israelis, had said yes to. And we\u2019re working that almost literally as we speak.\n\nI believe that it is, yes, achievable and it would be the best play forward, the quickest way to end the conflict in Gaza, to stop the violence, to massively surge assistance, to get everyone home, including American hostages. But it\u2019s also true that one individual, likely buried hundreds of feet underground in Gaza, has the decision-making power to say yes or no. And right now, in not saying yes, Mr. Sinwar is not only holding on to the Israeli, American, and other hostages; he\u2019s continuing to make a hostage of Palestinian children, women, and men who are caught in a horrific crossfire of Hamas\u2019s making.\n\nSo the question that I can\u2019t answer for you is will he get to yes. The world is looking for it. The world is asking for it. The world is demanding it.\n\nNow, if not, of course, we\u2019re looking at what comes next, and I think what\u2019s critical is this. We\u2019ll see. We\u2019ve heard the Israelis talk about a significant downshift in their operations in Gaza. It remains to be seen. We do know this: One way or another, when this conflict ends, it cannot and must not end with a vacuum in Gaza. It has to end in a way that makes sure that there are clear, coherent, achievable plans for Gaza\u2019s governance, for its security, and of course to start to help people to rebuild their lives that have been so decimated and destroyed.\n\nWe\u2019ve been working over the last months with partners throughout the region to develop those plans, and as I said a couple of weeks ago when I was last in the region, a lot of that work has now turned into concrete ideas, concrete proposals that we\u2019re sharing with partners in the region \u2013 again, as we speak \u2013 to try to flesh things out and to try to make sure that we have the broadest possible agreement on what the right way forward is.\n\nSo the post-conflict plans are critical because if we get to a moment where the conflict really does shift dramatically, and hopefully the best possible thing would be the ceasefire, if we\u2019re not ready, if the region\u2019s not ready, then you\u2019re going to have a vacuum. And as I said before, vacuums tend to get filled by bad things before they get filled with good things.\n\nAnd we know that there are three things that are unacceptable for Gaza\u2019s future: an Israeli occupation; Hamas perpetuating its leadership; or chaos, anarchy, lawlessness, which is what we\u2019re seeing in big parts of Gaza today. Absent concrete plans to have an alternative to that, that \u2013 one of those three things is going to happen. And given all of the extraordinary suffering that we\u2019ve seen to date, that should be unacceptable, and it\u2019s unacceptable to us.\n\nMS MALONEY: And the plans that you\u2019ve been discussing with regional partners and others, are they ready to go? If for some reason Sinwar were to suddenly have a flash of humanity and accept the plan for a ceasefire and release the hostages, would we have \u2013 be able to move immediately to put the security, the governance, and the start of a reconstruction program in place? Or are we likely to be outpaced by other adversaries in the region who in past conflicts have moved more quickly than the international community?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, we\u2019re determined not to be outpaced, which is exactly why we\u2019re leaning into this. It\u2019s exactly why we\u2019ve been calling on so many of the concerned countries to engage in this effort. We really started back in January with many Arab partners on this. We\u2019ve told the Israelis that we expect them to develop their own plans, their own ideas. And we\u2019ve not seen enough of that from Israel. But no, precisely because we don\u2019t want to be caught off guard by this. This is exactly what all of our diplomats are deeply engaged in as we speak so that we are ready when we get the moment, and we need to get that moment as quickly as possible.\n\nMS MALONEY: One last question before I turn it over to the audience for just a few questions before we unfortunately will have to let Secretary Blinken go back to his very busy day. We have with us in the audience former U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon Jeff Feltman. We were speaking before the festivities began here about the prospects for significant action in Lebanon. The Israelis seem to be signaling that quite heavily right now, particularly as they downshift in Gaza, that they will have more capabilities to apply to dealing with a threat that is posed by Hizballah that has forced at least 55,000 Israelis out of their homes in the north. How imminent do you rate that threat, and what is it that the United States is doing to try to develop diplomatic alternatives to a military solution to Hizballah, which we know has been quite elusive over the decades?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: One of our primary objectives from day one \u2013 since October \u2013 was to do everything we could to make sure that this conflict didn\u2019t spread, didn\u2019t escalate, including and notably to the north, to Lebanon, to Hizballah, and then maybe beyond. And so this too is a place of intense focus. And I think you have a paradox in this moment, which is that at least in our judgement none of the main actors actually want a war. Israel doesn\u2019t want a war, although they may well be prepared to engage in one if necessary from their perspective to protect their interests, but they don\u2019t want one. I don\u2019t believe Hizballah actually wants a war. Lebanon certainly doesn\u2019t want a war because it would be the leading victim in such a war. And I don\u2019t believe that Iran wants a war, in part because it wants to make sure that Hizballah\u2019s not destroyed and that it can hold onto Hizballah as a card if it needs it, if it ever gets into a direct conflict with Israel. So on the one hand, no one actually wants a war.\n\nOn the other hand, you have forces \u2013 momentum that may be leading in that direction and which we are determined to try to arrest. You have as you said, Suzanne, 60,000 or so Israelis who have been forced from their homes in northern Israel. Israel has affectively lost sovereignty in the northern quadrant of its country because people don\u2019t feel safe to go to their homes. You have many Lebanese in southern Lebanon who have also been chased from their homes. And absent doing something about the insecurity, people won\u2019t have the confidence to go back. And that requires two things. It requires first and foremost, of course, stopping the firing across the border that\u2019s endangering people, but it also requires an agreement reached through diplomacy to try to deal with some of the elements that are causing this ongoing insecurity, including making sure that forces, for example, are pulled back so that they can\u2019t endanger people every single day and that people have the confidence to proceed.\n\nHere, again, the United States has been deeply engaged in trying to advance this diplomacy, but it also underscores why a ceasefire in Gaza is so critical. Hizballah, of course, has tied what it\u2019s doing to the situation in Gaza and has said that if there\u2019s a ceasefire in Gaza, it will stop firing into Israel. Now, that\u2019s \u2013 it shouldn\u2019t be firing to begin with. It\u2019s wrong in and of itself. But it\u2019s also a reality. So it only underscores why getting that ceasefire could also be critical to further enabling the diplomacy to try to create conditions in which the diplomacy can really resolve this problem, get people back to their homes in Israel, in southern Lebanon, and have something that\u2019s more enduring in terms of keeping things calm.\n\nBy the way, Red Sea \u2013 the Houthis \u2013 same thing. Iran, Iranian-aligned militia groups \u2013 so much of this is tied to Gaza, and I think it underscores why it\u2019s clearly in the strategic interests of Israel as well to effectively bring this to a close.\n\nMS MALONEY: Thank you so much. We have just two minutes so I\u2019m going to try to take two very, very quick questions from our audience here in sequence and then leave it to Secretary Blinken to close us out.\n\nIf I can give my colleague, Lynn Kuok, our Lee Kuan Yew Chair for Southeast Asia Studies here at Brookings, the first question.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you very much, Suzanne, and thank you, Secretary Blinken. You mentioned several times the greater convergence with Asian partners. That, I think, may well be the case for northeast Asia \u2013 and you mentioned how Japan and South Korea are joining the NATO summit, and of course, there\u2019s strong recognition that the two theaters \u2013 the Indo-Pacific as well as Euro-Atlantic \u2013 are linked. But I would suggest that the picture is rather less clear in Southeast Asia. Many of the countries there have not taken a strong stance on Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, and in a recent poll China for the very first time ever has edged past the United States in being the region\u2019s choice of partner. If the region were forced to choose, how do you think the \u2013 how do you think the U.S. losing ground to China in Southeast Asia hurts U.S. goals in the broader Indo-Pacific region? And what is being done about it? Thank you.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: So I\u2019m seeing something different. And I acknowledge the complexity of it. And you\u2019re right, it\u2019s not a uniform picture, but I\u2019m seeing something different. Look at the relationship \u2013 again, just over the last few years \u2013 that\u2019s evolved between the United States and the Philippines. Look at the relationship that\u2019s evolved between the United States and Vietnam \u2013 and in different, sometimes quieter ways, relationships with other countries in Southeast Asia. I think we\u2019re in a very different place, and I think it\u2019s the product of a recognition on the part of a number of countries at some of the challenges that China poses to them, and that they have a real issue with \u2013 notably, China\u2019s action in the South China Sea, which affects the interests of many countries. We see that most prominently with the Philippines, but it\u2019s of course not just the Philippines.\n\nI think countries also recognize that the number-one provider of foreign direct investment in those countries is actually the United States. We understandably talk a lot about trade \u2013 that\u2019s important \u2013 but countries also see that the FDI that\u2019s going to them and coming from the United States is making a huge difference in the kinds of investments they can make in their own future. And this is something that they not only want to sustain, they want to build.\n\nAnd look, we\u2019ve been very clear with many partners and many countries: We\u2019re not asking countries to choose, we\u2019re simply trying to make sure that we\u2019re providing a clear choice, and what I believe in most cases is actually a better choice. The more we\u2019re able to do that, the more they see that, I have no doubt where they\u2019ll go. Now, again, you \u2013 sometimes that\u2019s a little bit more quiet. Sometimes it\u2019s a little bit more vocal. But the trajectory is clear.\n\nThe last thing I\u2019ll say on this is this: There is also room for everyone, which is to say if there are investments that are being made in infrastructure, in connectivity, in the future, that investment is desperately needed. As long as it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s the kind of investment that creates a race to the top, not a race to the bottom, not piling debt on country after country, not bringing in your own workers to build a project, not doing something that turns out to have really shoddy standards so that it falls apart in a few years, not ignoring the environment, not ignoring the rights of workers \u2013 if that\u2019s the kind of investment that\u2019s being made, then bring it on, it\u2019s great \u2013 from anywhere, including from China.\n\nI think countries, though, are also eyes-wide-open about the fact that when it comes to China, there is a fusion between the military and civilian sectors, and anything that quote/unquote \u201ccivilian investment\u201d does automatically becomes the property of the state and the property of the military. And that\u2019s of concern to countries as well.\n\nSo I see us, again, in a very different place than we were just a few years ago in these relationships, in these partnerships \u2013 both individually with a number of countries, but also with some of the critical institutions like ASEAN, where we\u2019ve had extraordinary ASEAN summits, including here in Washington, that President Biden has hosted, to continue to build those relationships. And then individual countries in the region are also part of different collections of countries and organizations that we put together to deal with discrete problems.\n\nMany of these countries want support, assistance with their own maritime domain awareness \u2013 a fancy way of saying what\u2019s happening in the seas around them, upon which they\u2019re so dependent. We see many countries afflicted with the scourge of illegal, unregulated fishing, where industries are being decimated. We and other countries have provided assistance there so that they can gain control of their own seas and their own waters. All of these things are making a difference every day, and of course, climate\u2019s a whole other subject where so many countries are looking for partnership and the kind of partnership that we\u2019re working to provide.\n\nMS MALONEY: I think we have time for one more question. I\u2019m looking for someone from our early career staff here at Brookings, perhaps. I see a hand up right there, and I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t call on you by name, but a mike will be coming to you in just a moment.\n\nQUESTION: Hi. Sopiko, a research analyst at Brookings, originally from Georgia. Thank you for the discussion. And Secretary Blinken, as we approach the 75th NATO summit in Washington, D.C., South Caucasus remains a region of strategic importance. In the light of the recent developments, including ongoing tension between Armenia and Azerbaijan, Georgia\u2019s upcoming election in October 2024, so-called foreign agent law, infrastructure deals in the Black Sea with China, and shifting geopolitical dynamics \u2013 meaning reduced Russia influence and increased Western engagement in Armenia \u2013 how does the U.S. view the influence and interests of the global powers in the region? Thank you so much.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Thanks. Well, you\u2019re very right to point to the region and to point to a tremendous amount of movement in the region. And we have, I think, both real concerns but also real opportunities. You mentioned the foreign agent law in Georgia. We and many other countries have not only expressed our deep concerns about it, especially its passage; we\u2019ve taken action to manifest those concerns. And I think you\u2019re likely to see more of that. I think it\u2019s clearly antithetical to the European direction that Georgia wants to take, and that clearly the majority of the Georgian people want to take.\n\nArmenia and Azerbaijan \u2013 there is an extraordinary opportunity, potential to realize a peace agreement between the countries that ends decades of conflict and actually creates in the region, I think, a tremendous opportunity for economic connectivity, for economic growth, for connecting countries both east, west, north, and south. Azerbaijan has a critical role to play in that. We have invested intensely in our own \u2013 with our own diplomacy in trying to help bring Azerbaijan and Armenia to a peace agreement. We\u2019ve done that in very close collaboration, coordination with the European Union, and I think that that\u2019s something that really is within reach. I was speaking just about a week ago to President Aliyev on this. I think that\u2019s achievable, and it\u2019s manifestly in the interests of both Azerbaijan and Armenia, as well as the broader region.\n\nSo we\u2019re attuned to the challenges, including some of the ones you\u2019ve expressed in Georgia. We\u2019re also very focused on some of the opportunity, and the opportunity is real. Thank you.\n\nMS MALONEY: Before I close out our conversation today, I want to ask all of you to help us by staying in your seats while we bring Secretary Blinken and his colleagues to their vehicles, and so if you could just stay put in just a moment. But first let me \u2013 please join me in thanking Secretary Blinken, his amazing team, and the amazing team at Brookings that made this possible. (Applause.)",

        "text": "What does Trump\u2019s Supreme Court immunity decision mean?\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) ruled that Donald Trump is immune from prosecution for acts he committed within his constitutional powers as president.\n\nThe ruling applies to anyone who holds the position of US president. However, a president can be prosecuted for acts committed in a personal capacity.\n\nWhile questions of presidential immunity have arisen before, such as during Richard Nixon\u2019s Watergate scandal and Bill Clinton\u2019s sexual assault lawsuit, this is the first time a former US president has been indicted on criminal charges.\n\nThe latest ruling further delays the Washington criminal case against Trump on charges that he was involved in attempting to overturn his 2020 presidential election loss and inciting the US Capitol riots on January 6, 2021. The case had been referred to the Supreme Court to determine the issue of immunity. It will now return to the lower court.\n\nThis is the first time the SCOTUS has formally ruled that former presidents may be protected from criminal charges.\n\nDescribed by Trump as a \u201cBIG WIN\u201d on Truth Social, a social media platform owned by the Republican leader, but as a \u201cdangerous precedent\u201d by President Joe Biden, here is more about the historic 6-3 SCOTUS ruling on immunity:\n\nWhat does the Supreme Court\u2019s Trump immunity verdict say?\n\nSix Supreme Court justices \u2013 all appointed by Republican presidents \u2013 of nine agreed that if the president takes any action within the powers granted to him through the constitution, he cannot be prosecuted.\n\nThe US Constitution grants the president powers, including the ability to issue pardons, veto or sign bills, nominate high officials including cabinet members and Supreme Court justices, and direct the military after a congressional declaration of war on a foreign nation.\n\nThe verdict additionally grants presidents presumptive immunity \u201cfrom criminal prosecution for a President\u2019s acts within the outer perimeter of his official responsibility\u201d, meaning a president is presumed to enjoy immunity from prosecution if his action pertains even just a small amount to his official status.\n\nFurthermore, the court ruled that if a president is prosecuted for an act carried out in a personal capacity, the prosecution cannot refer to the president\u2019s official actions in evidence.\n\nWho dissented in the Trump immunity case?\n\nThree justices \u2013 Sonia Sotomayor, Ketanji Brown Jackson and Elena Kagan \u2013 disagreed with the SCOTUS opinion, issuing a 29-page dissent.\n\nLed by Sotomayor, the dissent said, \u201cWith fear for our democracy, I dissent.\u201d\n\nDoes this verdict grant full immunity to a US president?\n\nThe immunity verdict does not technically place Trump above the law, because he (and any former president) can still be prosecuted for unofficial acts not pertaining to his presidential capacity.\n\nHowever, critics argue that, in practice, it could grant a former president complete immunity.\n\nThe SCOTUS opinion grants presumptive immunity, making it difficult to discern between acts committed in a personal or presidential capacity.\n\nMany critics say it will be too difficult to differentiate actions by a president in their \u201cpersonal\u201d capacity from those in their \u201cofficial\u201d capacity.\n\n\u201cUnder this Court\u2019s opinion, the only thing that will stop a president from abusing their power is their own sense of restraint and people in the executive branch who may not follow their orders,\u201d Chris Edelson, an assistant professor of government at American University, told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cWe face the imminent prospect that a would-be dictator could take office if Trump wins the election this fall.\u201d\n\nWhat does this mean for Trump\u2019s election subversion case?\n\nLikely, Trump cannot be prosecuted over allegations that he pressured Vice President Mike Pence to reject certification of Biden\u2019s win on January 6, 2021. This allegation forms part of the Washington case against Trump.\n\nMoreover, he cannot be prosecuted for seeking to pressure the Department of Justice to investigate unfounded claims of election fraud, which also formed part of the case.\n\nWhat happens next in the election subversion case?\n\nTrump\u2019s election subversion case goes back to District Judge Tanya Chutkan of the lower court in Washington, DC to determine which acts Trump should be prosecuted for.\n\nContrary to Trump\u2019s wishes, SCOTUS did not dismiss his indictment that alleges he illegally schemed to cling to power after losing the election. The indictment was filed in August 2023 by Special Counsel Jack Smith. It accuses Trump of four felonies, some punishable with up to 20 years in prison.\n\nBesides granting Trump presumptive immunity for pressuring Pence, the conservative SCOTUS justices also truncated the allegation that Trump tried to use the investigative power of the Department of Justice to overturn election results.\n\nJudge Chutkan now needs to analyse and determine whether other actions cited in the indictment fall under official conduct for which Trump would be immune from prosecution.\n\nTrump\u2019s communications to his supporters which the case alleges incited the January 6, 2021 Capitol riots will also be analysed to determine whether they fall under official conduct. This includes his posts on X and a speech he made.\n\nIt is currently uncertain what far-reaching consequences the SCOTUS opinion will have for the lower courts in the longer term.\n\nWhat sorts of acts could a US president get away with now?\n\nThe opinion issued by the three dissenting justices lists \u201cnightmare\u201d scenarios in which presidents could misuse immunity, such as organising a military coup to hold on to power or ordering the assassination of a political rival.\n\n\u201cIn every use of official power, the President is now a king above the law,\u201d Justice Sotomayor wrote in her part of the dissenting opinion.\n\n\u2018This new official-acts immunity now \u201clies about like a loaded weapon\u201d for any president to place his own interests\u2026.above the interests of the nation.\u201d Sonia Sotomayor\u2019s dissent is among the most strongly-worded and chilling in Supreme Court history. pic.twitter.com/64dCXJaJvy \u2014 Nick Bryant (@NickBryantNY) July 1, 2024\n\nCould Trump have convictions overturned or dismiss other cases against him?\n\nWith the ruling, Trump could achieve his legal strategy \u2013 delay the case proceedings until the election is over. A trial before the election is now highly unlikely.\n\nIf Trump wins the election, he could potentially order a pardon for himself or seek the dismissal of the case and the other cases against him by appointing an attorney general who is sympathetic to him.\n\nTrump\u2019s legal team has already applied for his conviction in a New York court of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records relating to a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels to be overturned. The defence team has also requested that his sentencing hearing, originally scheduled for July 11, be delayed.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers say some of the evidence used in this case \u2013 such as those relating to public statements made by Trump \u2013 is now excluded by the Supreme Court\u2019s immunity ruling and, therefore, should not have been used at trial.\n\nWhether Trump\u2019s legal arguments are upheld has yet to be seen.\n\nHow have been the reactions to the Supreme Court immunity verdict?\n\nDonald Trump celebrated the ruling in a post on Truth Social. Shortly after the decision, he wrote: \u201cBIG WIN FOR OUR CONSTITUTION AND DEMOCRACY. PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN!\u201d\n\ncelebrated the ruling in a post on Truth Social. Shortly after the decision, he wrote: \u201cBIG WIN FOR OUR CONSTITUTION AND DEMOCRACY. PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN!\u201d Joe Biden blasted the ruling in a White House video message on Monday saying: \u201cNo one is above the law. Not even the President of United States. But with today\u2019s Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity that fundamentally changed.\u201d He warned that the ruling sets a \u201cdangerous precedent because the power of the office will no longer be constrained by the law, even including the Supreme Court of the United States. The only limits will be self-imposed by the president alone\u201d.\n\nHillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee in the 2016 presidential race, posted on X referring to the assenting justices as the \u201cMAGA wing of the Supreme Court\u201d.\n\nI agree with Justice Sotomayor about the immunity ruling from the MAGA wing of the Supreme Court: \u201cWith fear for our democracy, I dissent.\u201d It will be up to the American people this November to hold Donald Trump accountable. \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) July 1, 2024\n\nMike Johnson, Republican House speaker, lauded the ruling in an X post on Monday saying: \u201cToday\u2019s ruling by the court is a victory for former President Trump and all future presidents, and another defeat for President Biden\u2019s weaponised Department of Justice and Jack Smith.\u201d He was referring to what some Republicans say is the use of the court system against Trump by Democrats in an act of \u201clawfare\u201d.\n\nToday\u2019s ruling by the Court is a victory for former President Trump and all future presidents, and another defeat for President Biden\u2019s weaponized Department of Justice and Jack Smith. The Court clearly stated that presidents are entitled to immunity for their official acts.\u2026 \u2014 Speaker Mike Johnson (@SpeakerJohnson) July 1, 2024\n\nChuck Schumer, Democratic Senate leader, posted several times on X condemning the ruling, calling the Court \u201cMAGA SCOTUS\u201d, a reference to Trump\u2019s Make America Great Again (MAGA) campaign. \u201cTreason or incitement of an insurrection should not be considered a core constitutional power afforded to a president,\u201d he wrote. He also shared an excerpt from the justices\u2019 dissent.\n\nThis disgraceful decision by the MAGA SCOTUS\u2014which is comprised of 3 justices appointed by Trump himself\u2014enables the former President to weaken our democracy by breaking the law. It undermines SCOTUS's credibility and suggests political influence trumps all in our courts today. https://t.co/wCNI42U5Ki \u2014 Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) July 1, 2024\n\nMonday also saw protests outside the Supreme Court by Americans opposing the ruling.",

Many of them have called for his replacement. However, the US Democratic Party may find it difficult to find his replacement, considering various political calculations. In this regard, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock may be the perfect fit as Democrats are concerned about the outcome of the upcoming presidential poll. While many surveys found that the Democrats favor Vice-President Kamala Harris and the Governor of California Gavin Newson, there are some challenges with both these candidates.Many of the Democrats do favor Harris but the US Vice-President is not known for her campaigning abilities. Her presidential bid in 2020 fizzled out in the early stages. While she does not have any cognitive decline, she has her own communication problems. Many times, she is unable to communicate clearly and this leaves many listeners bemused.Gavin Newson on the other hand is hoping to contest the US Presidential Election in 2028. He is a front runner but he has certain challenges he has to encounter. His track record on governance has been questioned by his critics who point out that more than one-third of all homeless population in the US resides in the state of California. Further, there is increasing crimes in the state which is considered to be the hi-tech state with many companies in the tech sector being based out of the Silicon Valley.For the Democrats, replacing a white man who is a president and a non-white vice-president will be a tough task ahead. They are likely to lose the support from their traditional supporters including those from the black community.This is where the Whitmer-Warnock combination will help the Democrats. Firstly, both the members are young enough to articulate their views and distinguish themselves from their predecessors. Secondly, the party needs to satisfy independent moderates and lastly, it needs to include a black and a woman who can help the party retain its vote share.Whitmer has been elected twice as the Governor of Michigan and Warnock has won representing Georgia in the US Senate. He had earlier served as a pastor. These reasons support both Whitmer and Warnock as potential candidates in the upcoming poll.She has ruled out a career in politics and has supported Biden. Further, she lacks the administrative experience and may not be able to muster the support of the Democrats and other voters.An individual can hold office for 2 terms. Further, each of these terms is for a period for 4 years each.",

        "text": "Analysis: The Supreme Court just gave presidents a superpower. Here\u2019s its explanation\nA version of this story appears in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nWith its immunity ruling on Monday, the Supreme Court granted former President Donald Trump\u2019s wish of all but guaranteeing that his criminal trial for trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election will not go to trial before the 2024 election in November.\n\nIt also granted presidents in general a definitive \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d from prosecution for core official acts and said presidents should be presumed immune for a much more expansive list of acts.\n\nIn the view of the majority comprised of the six conservative justices on the court, the decision does not place presidents in general, and Trump in particular, above the law. But the three liberals dissented with a warning about how elevating a president will affect American democracy.\n\nThe decision has the near-term result of delaying Trump\u2019s trial while a court in Washington, DC, considers which criminal activity that Trump is accused of can be considered \u201cunofficial.\u201d It also has the long-term effect of placing presidents in a different system of justice than other Americans.\n\nHere are key lines from a landmark ruling:\n\nWhat is this new immunity?\n\nChief Justice John Roberts explains it in the majority opinion as including absolute immunity for some actions and a presumption of immunity for others.\n\nWe conclude that under our constitutional structure of separated powers, the nature of Presidential power requires that a former President have some immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts during his tenure in office. At least with respect to the President\u2019s exercise of his core constitutional powers, this immunity must be absolute. As for his remaining official actions, he is also entitled to immunity. At the current stage of proceedings in this case, however, we need not and do not decide whether that immunity must be absolute, or instead whether a presumptive immunity is sufficient. John Roberts in the majority opinion\n\nWhy does a president need this immunity?\n\nSo that he can act boldly as president and take actions without fear of later prosecution clouding his judgement, according to the court. Here\u2019s Roberts:\n\nPotential criminal liability, and the peculiar public opprobrium that attaches to criminal proceedings, are plainly more likely to distort Presidential decisionmaking than the potential payment of civil damages.\n\nThe hesitation to execute the duties of his office fearlessly and fairly that might result when a President is making decisions under \u201ca pall of potential prosecution,\u201d \u2026 raises \u201cunique risks to the effective functioning of government.\u201d\n\nWhat does it say in the Constitution about presidents getting special immunity?\n\nNothing. But that\u2019s no problem, according to Roberts.\n\nTrue, there is no \u201cPresidential immunity clause\u201d in the Constitution. But there is no \u201c\u2018separation of powers clause\u2019\u201d either. \u2026 Yet that doctrine is undoubtedly carved into the Constitution\u2019s text by its three articles separating powers and vesting the Executive power solely in the President.\n\nHow far does this immunity extend?\n\nA president gets \u201cat least a presumptive immunity\u201d even for acts \u201cwithin the outer perimeter of his official responsibility,\u201d according to the court. But it\u2019s careful to add that he gets no immunity for \u201cunofficial acts\u201d \u2013 and despite the broad reach of the immunity, the court argues presidents are still accountable.\n\nThe President enjoys no immunity for his unofficial acts, and not everything the President does is official. The President is not above the law. But Congress may not criminalize the President\u2019s conduct in carrying out the responsibilities of the Executive Branch under the Constitution.\n\nAre any of the things Trump is accused of in special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s indictment outside this blanket of immunity?\n\nDuring oral arguments in the case back in April, Trump\u2019s attorney, John Sauer, told Justice Amy Coney Barrett that multiple elements of the indictment would indeed be \u201cprivate,\u201d or unofficial, acts. These include, for instance, getting an outside attorney to organize slates of false electors.\n\nBarrett, in a concurring opinion on Monday, said she would make clear in the decision what was official versus unofficial. But the majority takes no position and wants the trial court to go through the allegations individually. Trump can then appeal whatever the trial court decides. Here\u2019s Roberts:\n\n\u2026 the current stage of the proceedings in this case does not require us to decide whether this immunity is presumptive or absolute. \u2026 Because we need not decide that question today, we do not decide it.\n\nDoes the majority tell the trial court what might be official or not?\n\nThe majority gives quite a bit of detail.\n\nTrump has \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d for any instructions or pressure he exerted on his acting attorney general, for instance. Plus, the court won\u2019t allow as evidence any interviews with people who worked in the administration (nullifying much of the evidence gathered by the House select committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, events). And it also won\u2019t let a court consider a president\u2019s motives for taking an action.\n\nSuch an inquiry would risk exposing even the most obvious instances of official conduct to judicial examination on the mere allegation of improper purpose, thereby intruding on the Article II interests that immunity seeks to protect.\n\nIt\u2019s an open question for the lower court to decide if Trump\u2019s pressure on then-Vice President Mike Pence to disregard the 2020 election results involved \u201cofficial conduct,\u201d but the Supreme Court put that pressure in the \u201cpresumptively immune\u201d category.\n\nWe accordingly remand to the District Court to determine in the first instance\u2014with the benefit of briefing we lack\u2014whether Trump\u2019s conduct in this area qualifies as official or unofficial.\n\nThe majority thinks Trump\u2019s tweets encouraging people to go to the Capitol and pressure Pence are within the \u201couter perimeter of his official responsibilities,\u201d but they\u2019re not sure and they expect it will be challenging for the lower court to muddle through these questions.\n\nWhy can\u2019t a jury make these decisions?\n\nJuries can\u2019t even consider official acts in terms of a prosecution, according to the Supreme Court.\n\nAllowing prosecutors to ask or suggest that the jury probe official acts for which the President is immune would thus raise a unique risk that the jurors\u2019 deliberations will be prejudiced by their views of the President\u2019s policies and performance while in office. The prosaic tools on which the Government would have courts rely are an inadequate safeguard against the peculiar constitutional concerns implicated in the prosecution of a former President.\n\nSo the Supreme Court gave Trump everything he wanted?\n\nIt certainly embraced Trump\u2019s theory of immunity and pretty much guaranteed the trial will not happen before the election, although the majority says they were restrained since they rejected his request to completely dismiss the case.\n\nTrump asserts a far broader immunity than the limited one we have recognized. He contends that the indictment must be dismissed because the Impeachment Judgment Clause requires that impeachment and Senate conviction precede a President\u2019s criminal prosecution.\n\nSo there is a special system of justice for presidents?\n\nThe president is more than a person, according to Roberts.\n\nLike everyone else, the President is subject to prosecution in his unofficial capacity. But unlike anyone else, the President is a branch of government, and the Constitution vests in him sweeping powers and duties. Accounting for that reality\u2014and ensuring that the President may exercise those powers forcefully, as the Framers anticipated he would\u2014does not place him above the law; it preserves the basic structure of the Constitution from which that law derives.\n\nThe majority dismisses warnings about a president operating above the laws as \u201cfear mongering on the basis of extreme hypotheticals.\u201d It\u2019s more important to protect the president from political prosecutions, the court says.\n\nThe dissents overlook the more likely prospect of an Executive Branch that cannibalizes itself, with each successive President free to prosecute his predecessors, yet unable to boldly and fearlessly carry out his duties for fear that he may be next. \u2026 The enfeebling of the Presidency and our Government that would result from such a cycle of factional strife is exactly what the Framers intended to avoid.\n\nRoberts borrows from Trump\u2019s attorneys when he quotes George Washington\u2019s farewell address, in which he warns about factions. The problem with that particular quote, as I found earlier this year, is that Washington also warned about elevating a person above the law.\n\nDoes the court mention the politics of today?\n\nRoberts says the court\u2019s considerations are more far-reaching than what\u2019s happening at the moment.\n\nThis case poses a question of lasting significance: When may a former President be prosecuted for official acts taken during his Presidency? Our Nation has never before needed an answer. But in addressing that question today, unlike the political branches and the public at large, we cannot afford to fixate exclusively, or even primarily, on present exigencies. In a case like this one, focusing on \u201ctransient results\u201d may have profound consequences for the separation of powers and for the future of our Republic.\n\nDid it say anything about Smith?\n\nThe majority did not weigh in on the brewing argument among conservatives that Smith should not even have a job and that his role as a special counsel is unconstitutional. But Justice Clarence Thomas endorsed the idea in a concurring opinion.\n\nIn this case, there has been much discussion about ensuring that a President \u201cis not above the law.\u201d But, as the Court explains, the President\u2019s immunity from prosecution for his official acts is the law. \u2026 In that same vein, the Constitution also secures liberty by separating the powers to create and fill offices. And, there are serious questions whether the Attorney General has violated that structure by creating an office of the Special Counsel that has not been established by law.\n\nWhat did Barrett say about alternate electors?\n\nBarrett, a Trump appointee, wrote her own concurrence in which she disagreed with the majority on some key points. She said they could easily have expressed that some of Trump\u2019s conduct was unofficial.\n\nSorting private from official conduct sometimes will be difficult\u2014but not always. Take the President\u2019s alleged attempt to organize alternative slates of electors. \u2026 In my view, that conduct is private and therefore not entitled to protection. \u2026 a President has no legal authority\u2014and thus no official capacity\u2014to influence how the States appoint their electors. I see no plausible argument for barring prosecution of that alleged conduct.\n\nWhat was in the blistering dissent?\n\nWriting for the three liberals on the court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor blasted the majority as inventing an \u201catextual, ahistorical, and unjustifiable immunity that puts the President above the law.\u201d She said the court makes it difficult to imagine what might be \u201cunofficial\u201d conduct on the part of the president.\n\nIn sum, the majority today endorses an expansive vision of Presidential immunity that was never recognized by the Founders, any sitting President, the Executive Branch, or even President Trump\u2019s lawyers, until now. Settled understandings of the Constitution are of little use to the majority in this case, and so it ignores them. \u2026 In fact, the majority\u2019s dividing line between \u201cofficial\u201d and \u201cunofficial\u201d conduct narrows the conduct considered \u201cunofficial\u201d almost to a nullity.\n\nThe majority \u201cpays lip service\u201d to the idea that presidents are not above the law \u201cbut it then proceeds to place former Presidents beyond the reach of the federal criminal laws for any abuse of official power.\u201d\n\nHow far does Sotomayor say presidents can now go?\n\nAs far as they want, she says.\n\nThe President of the United States is the most powerful person in the country, and possibly the world. When he uses his official powers in any way, under the majority\u2019s reasoning, he now will be insulated from criminal prosecution. Orders the Navy\u2019s Seal Team 6 to assassinate a political rival? Immune. Organizes a military coup to hold onto power? Immune. Takes a bribe in exchange for a pardon? Immune. Immune, immune, immune.\n\n\u2026 Even if these nightmare scenarios never play out, and I pray they never do, the damage has been done. The relationship between the President and the people he serves has shifted irrevocably. In every use of official power, the President is now a king above the law.\n\nSotomayor ends her missive like this:",

        "text": "Iran's 2024 election: Will the presidential run-off vote lead Iran back toward the West, or Russia and China?\nOver the weekend, Iranians voted to elect a new president to replace Ibrahim Raisi, who was killed in a helicopter crash in May. At least, some Iranians did.\n\nVoter turnout was barely 40%, the lowest in Iran's presidential electoral history. Millions of Iranians, disillusioned by decades of undelivered political promises, simply stayed home on voting day. When it was all over, neither of the two leading candidates \u2014 the more moderate Masoud Pazeshkian nor hardliner Saeed Jalili \u2014 had won more than 50% of the vote, and the right to claim the presidency.\n\nThat means there will be a second, run-off round of voting on July 5, with only those two men on the ballot.\n\nCBS News senior foreign correspondent Elizabeth Palmer sat down in Tehran after the first round with CBS News' long-time Iran producer, Seyed Bathaei, to discuss the candidates, their ability to improve people's lives, and how they might influence the trajectory of Iran's relations with the West.\n\nWhat follows is a transcript of their discussion, which has been edited for clarity and to remove repetition. You can watch the video of the conversation in the player at the top of this page.\n\nElizabeth Palmer: We're headed for a run-off between the two main candidates from this first round. Tell us a little bit about them \u2014 first of all, Mr. Jalili.\n\nSeyed Bathaei: Well, Mr. Jalili is being called a hardliner. He himself likes to be called a principlist. He was a tough [nuclear] negotiator long ago\u2026 known for his tough stance against the West. So many people believe that if he becomes the Iranian president, then Iran probably will have much more trouble with the West.\n\nPalmer: How does Mr. Jalili propose to fix the economy, if it's not by trying to thaw things with the West and the U.S.?\n\nBathaei: He has promised that they would rely on local resources rather than looking to the West to solve problems, meaning that even if the nuclear deal is not renegotiated, Iran can still get along okay.\n\nPalmer: By being radically self-sufficient? A sort of a 100% made-in-Iran policy?\n\nBathaei: Yes. Also focussing on how Iran now has got many strong, powerful friends \u2014 Russia and China. Iran really relies on these relationships\u2026[which is] being called a pivot to the East.\n\nPalmer: So, Mr. Jalili would be comfortable looking for support from the East, especially Russia and China and in effect turning his back on the West, America and Europe?\n\nBathaei: Iranian officials \u2014 the whole administration \u2014 have said that this is the West's fault, because the West backed away from the nuclear deal, and that the West who was not happy with the results of the negotiations. They say the West was never seriously engaged, economically, with Iran. So, Iran is now looking to the East instead.\n\nPalmer: But the deal did ease sanctions a little bit and life did improve somewhat. How do they explain that?\n\nBathaei: That is the argument of people who are disappointed with the administration, and they want some changes, and this is what Mr. Pezeshkian, the other candidate, the moderate, has promised.\n\nPalmer: Tell us a little bit about him.\n\nPresidential candidates Masoud Pezeshkian and Saeed Jalili attend an election debate at a television studio in Tehran, Iran, July 1, 2024. Morteza Fakhri Nezhad/IRIB/WANA/Handout via REUTERS\n\nBathaei: Mr. Pezeshkian is a long-time member of parliament. A heart surgeon himself, he was for some time the Minister of Health and has promised to repair, as much as he can, the relationship with the West. He believes that rules on many issues people have protested against over the last two years, including the wearing of the hijab, should be eased. Some people believe that he can deliver, but many also think that within the framework of Iran's present constitution, he will not be able to keep many of those promises.\n\nPalmer: What power does the President actually have, given that the big national strategy is set by the Supreme Leader?\n\nBathaei: Well, as you know\u2026., in Iran, a president is almost equal to a vice president in Western democracies. The president can set the tone and has some limited administrative power, but they cannot change foreign policy, for example.\n\nPalmer: Does it matter to the average citizen who the president is? Do you feel it in your life?\n\nBathaei: Well, the nation is divided. Some people think that yes, they matter, because they \u2026[implement] rules and regulations. But maybe those who didn't participate in yesterday's election believe that, no, the president doesn't matter, because nothing will change anyway.\n\nPalmer: Now that this race has been distilled to two candidates, on opposite ends of the spectrum, is it likely to push all kinds of people to the polls for the second round? Those who didn't come out in the first, perhaps?\n\nBathaei: I think that's what both candidates are counting on. But Iranians are so unpredictable, so who knows? Next Friday a lot of people might show up to decide who the next president is, and maybe the result might trigger some changes, even if they're small.\n\nPalmer: Would you say that economic well-being is the number one issue for most voters, many of whom have been burdened by sanctions?\n\nBathaei: Yes, I believe the economy is the most important matter. People who go to the polling stations want to be able to put food on the table, to be able to support their families, to be able to support their children through school. But we also have many young people, intellectuals, university students, who want to have better relationships with the West so that they can go and spend time there, to study or visit their families. They also want hardline rules, like those governing women's dress code and music, to be eased.\n\nPalmer: Those issues are very contentious. As you mentioned, they were at the root of the big uprisings in 2022. Does a president actually have the power to change those things, or to adjust or to lighten the burden of such rules?\n\nBathaei: Well, many people believe so. There are of course things that cannot be drastically changed, even if the president wants to, because of religion. The Islamic Republic of Iran cannot denounce the hijab, for example, but it could definitely change how the laws surrounding it are implemented.\n\nPalmer: Stricter or not so strict, it's a question of degree?\n\nBathaei: Yes, and how people chanting in the streets are treated.\n\nPalmer: So just allowing a little bit of dissent to show, a little bit of the people's demands and dissatisfaction, is something a president could do, as opposed to ordering a harsh crackdown?\n\nBathaei: Yes, I think so. It's not expected that the next president will go and make friends with the U.S. or be an ally with the West, but definitely, the little steps in either direction matter.",

        "text": "Election 2024 Mobile Political Spam Texts Volume Jumps 3X\nW. Stuart Jones and Adam McNeil\n\nU.S. voters\u2019 appetite for digital information about the 2024 presidential election is growing. But as they consume news via digital media, including from mobile messaging channels, they must keep in mind that cybercriminals may be impersonating the sources that they trust.\n\nResearch helps to explain why attackers are so focused on exploiting users via these channels. Most U.S. adults (60%) prefer to get their news through digital media. An even higher percentage (86%) will often or sometimes consume news via a smartphone, tablet or computer. And most of the U.S. voting population (97%) has access to mobile messaging.\n\nMany users have a high level of trust in mobile messaging. However, the effects of smishing, impersonation, unwanted spam and excessive political messaging puts this trust at risk. And while many voters today are aware of fake news and political impersonation in social media, they may not know that there\u2019s a heightened risk for harm from mobile messaging and email-based impersonation tactics.\n\nElection-related smishing tactics on the rise\n\nThe use of mobile-based political messaging has skyrocketed as a way for campaigns and legitimate organizations and interest groups to reach voters. At the same time, bad actors are aggressively using the mobile messaging channel for impersonation, smishing, fraud and unwanted spam. Proofpoint research shows that U.S. smishing (text message-based phishing) attacks have increased more than 7% over the past nine months compared with the prior nine months.\n\nWe compared the reported mobile political spam volumes for the first five months of the 2024 presidential election year to volumes in the same period of the 2022 midterm election year. The volumes in 2024 were 3X greater than those in 2022.\n\nUnwanted political texts skyrocket after Trump guilty verdict\n\nIn the 48-hour period after the guilty verdict in former President Donald J. Trump\u2019s \u201chush money\u201d trial, Proofpoint threat engineers saw a 240% increase in subscriber reports of unwanted political messaging. Report volumes reached into the tens of millions.\n\nA sample of a Top 10 by volume, unwanted political message after the guilty verdict.\n\nA graph that shows the relative change in unwanted political messages after the guilty verdict.\n\nSimple steps to avoid risk of malicious, unsolicited political texts\n\nThis election season, voters need to proactively protect themselves against impersonation attacks. And mobile operators need to protect their end users, too. In fact, we must all maintain a healthy level of skepticism. We need to approach unsolicited messages across mobile, email and social media with extreme caution\u2014especially when a sender asks us to take urgent action.\n\nTo reduce your risk of exposure to malicious mobile messaging, follow some best practices. Do not open message attachments. And do not click on sent links. Instead, if you want to access a known website, enter the URL in your device\u2019s browser. Be sure to thoroughly examine all election-related digital messages to confirm that they do not pose a risk.\n\nHow Proofpoint can help\n\nProofpoint is committed to reducing the risk of fraud and unwanted messaging that falls outside acceptable use policies to help protect trust in the mobile channel. We have the world\u2019s most extensive threat intelligence. And we protect over 1.6 billion email and mobile accounts.\n\nFor mobile network operators, we are uniquely positioned to provide automated and predictive mobile messaging protection with offerings from Cloudmark, a Proofpoint company.

        "text": "Harvard Republican Club Endorses Donald Trump in 2024 Presidential Election\nThe Harvard Republican Club endorsed former U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday, the second time the club has endorsed Trump after snubbing his campaign during the 2016 election cycle.\n\nHarvard Republican Club President Michael Oved \u201925 announced the endorsement in an email to club members late Monday. The decision came after an internal vote among the club\u2019s registered voters, as well as a vote of its board, according to Oved. Oved said roughly 90 percent of voters in the club-wide election voted to endorse Trump.\n\n\u201cIn this race, Donald Trump is the most qualified candidate to lead our nation as President of the United States,\u201d Oved wrote in a statement. \u201cThe Harvard Republican Club is proud to formally endorse him.\u201d\n\nThe endorsement represents a yearslong evolution of the Harvard Republican Club from \u201cNever Trump\u201d conservatism to falling in line with the rest of the GOP establishment in embracing Trump.\n\nIn 2016, 80 percent of club members voted against endorsing Trump, and the club issued a statement that asserted Trump\u2019s rhetoric \u201cis poisoning our country and our children.\u201d In 2020, the club threw their support behind Trump and lauded several of his \u201cmarquee accomplishments,\u201d but reserved some qualms around his policy stances.\n\nBut this year, the club offered nothing but praise for Trump \u2014 along with sharp criticisms of U.S. President Joe Biden.\n\nThe HRC wrote in a press release that Trump \u201cis the only candidate with the mental capacity to run our country,\u201d citing Thursday\u2019s presidential debate between Trump and Biden. Biden\u2019s disastrous debate performance put his campaign on the defensive and amplified concerns about his ability to serve another four years in office.\n\n\u201cEven liberal media outlets were amazed at Biden\u2019s poor performance and bemoaned his repeated stumbling, loss of words, and inability to properly discuss his own policies,\u201d the HRC wrote. \u201cMillions of Americans \u2013 including this Board \u2013 are left wondering: under a Biden presidency, who is really running the country?\u201d\n\nTrump spokesperson Steven Cheung wrote in an emailed statement that Trump was \u201cuniting the entire party and all Americans together to defeat\u201d Biden.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNotably, the HRC\u2019s press release avoided any mention of Trump\u2019s conviction last month on 34 felony counts. The press release also did not address another set of Trump\u2019s favored talking points: his claims that the 2020 election was \u201cstolen\u201d and his defense of the rioters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to protest Biden\u2019s election victory.\n\nInstead, the press release touted the Trump administration\u2019s policy agenda, including the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which permanently cut the corporate tax rate and temporarily lowered rates for some individual tax brackets.\n\nThe HRC also praised Trump\u2019s work towards \u201ccurbing illegal immigration and building the border wall\u201d and his \u201ccommitment to protecting the Second Amendment.\u201d\n\nThe press release also focused on Trump\u2019s completion of the Supreme Court\u2019s six-to-three conservative majority, applauding cases like Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard \u2014 where the Court declared race conscious admissions unconstitutional \u2014 and Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade and left policy on abortion up to state governments.\n\nIn an interview, Oved pointed to the policy-heavy statement as a way to broaden the appeal of Trump and the GOP, describing it as \u201can explanation that\u2019s designed not just for the Harvard student body, not just for Republicans, but for Democrats, for independents, for moderates.\u201d\n\n\u201cEspecially on college campuses, you see students and sometimes even professors who simply don\u2019t understand how it can be that people actually support President Trump,\u201d Oved said.\n\n\u201cOutlining it all in this endorsement really is a way for us to show them this is what we believe \u2014 and we properly sourced it all,\u201d he added.\n\nConservative students represent a small minority of Harvard\u2019s student body, and Trump supporters an even smaller part. In The Crimson\u2019s September survey of Harvard\u2019s Class of 2027, only 8.4 percent of respondents described themselves as conservative or very conservative.\n\nOnly 3.6 percent of students said they viewed Trump favorably, a decrease from 7.1 percent in 2020. However, just 39.8 percent of the Class of 2027 viewed Biden favorably compared to 90.1 percent of the Class of 2024 in 2020. This year\u2019s poll marks a sharp decline in support for either candidate as the 2024 election approaches.\n\n\u2014Staff writer Elyse C. Goncalves can be reached at elyse.goncalves@thecrimson.com.

        "text": "Vice President of Kansas Company Pleads Guilty to Crimes Related to Scheme to Illegally Export U.S. Avionics Equipment to Russia and Russian End Users\nDouglas Edward Robertson, 56, of Olathe, Kansas, the former vice president of KanRus Trading Company Inc., pleaded guilty today for his role in a years-long conspiracy to circumvent U.S. export laws by filing false export forms with the U.S. government and, after Russia\u2019s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, continuing to sell and export sophisticated and controlled avionics equipment to customers in Russia without the required licenses from the U.S. Department of Commerce.\n\n\u201cRobertson, by his own admission, conspired to sell advanced U.S. avionics equipment to Russian customers in violation of U.S. law,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General for National Security Matthew G. Olsen. \u201cThe Justice Department will not tolerate those who seek to undermine the effectiveness of export controls that protect critical U.S. technology and deter Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\u201cRobertson\u2019s guilty plea is reflective of the strong evidence gathered against him by federal investigators and the solid case presented by federal prosecutors,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Kate E. Brubacher for the District of Kansas. \u201cOur nation is both proud and grateful to these men and women at the Department of Justice who seek to protect the United States and our national security interests from adversaries both foreign and domestic.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose who seek to profit by illegally selling sophisticated U.S. technology to our adversaries are putting the national security of our country at risk and that cannot be tolerated,\u201d said Executive Assistant Director Robert Wells of the FBI\u2019s National Security Branch. \u201cIt is appalling that the defendant schemed to smuggle avionics equipment to customers overseas including Russia, a nation engaged in a long-running military conflict with Ukraine. The FBI will work with our partners to stop the illegal flow of sensitive U.S. equipment and technology to foreign adversaries.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou might think that smuggling sensitive U.S.-origin technology to Russia, including to their Federal Security Service (FSB), means we\u2019re not in Kansas anymore. Unfortunately, in this case, we were,\u201d said Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement Matthew A. Axelrod. \u201cWe will continue to hold individuals everywhere, including those at the highest rungs of the corporate ladder, accountable when they violate our laws by lying on forms and transshipping items through third countries.\u201d\n\nAccording to court documents, as part of his guilty plea, Robertson admitted that between 2020 and when he was arrested in March 2023, he conspired with others \u2013 including co-defendants Cyril Gregory Buyanovsky of Lawrence, Kansas, and Oleg Chistyakov, aka Olegs \u010citsjakovs, of Riga, Latvia, \u2013 to smuggle U.S.-origin avionics equipment to end users in Russia, as well as Russian end users in other foreign countries by, among other actions, knowingly filing false export forms and failing to file required export forms with the U.S. government. In these forms, Robertson and his conspirators lied about the exports\u2019 value, end users, and end destinations.\n\nRobertson further admitted that on at least one occasion in 2021, he, Buyanovsky, and Chistyakov smuggled a repaired Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) to the FSB by removing the FSB sticker from the device before sending the device to a U.S. company to be repaired and then exporting the TCAS back to the FSB in Russia. At the time, the FSB was sanctioned by the U.S. Department of Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control for its interference in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election.\n\nRobertson further admitted that after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 and the U.S. government tightened export controls concerning Russia, he, co-defendants Buyanovsky and Chistyakov, and other conspirators continued to purchase and export U.S.-origin avionics equipment to customers in Russia and took numerous steps to hide their illegal activity from law enforcement, including by lying to U.S. suppliers about the intended end users; shipping goods through intermediary companies in Armenia, Laos, the United Arab Emirates, and Cyprus; continuing to file false export forms with the U.S. government; and using foreign bank accounts in countries other than Russia, such as Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Cyprus, the United Arab Emirates, and the Czech Republic, to promote their illegal export activity.\n\nOn Dec. 6, 2023, the U.S. Department of Commerce added many of the entities and individuals involved in KanRus and Robertson\u2019s illegal export scheme to the Commerce Department\u2019s Entity List as part of the U.S. government\u2019s interagency efforts to dismantle Russian procurement networks designed to circumvent U.S. export controls and sanctions imposed in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The Entity List imposes specific license requirements on all listed individuals and entities.\n\nIn December 2023, Buyanovsky, the former President and owner of KanRus, pleaded guilty to conspiracy and money laundering and consented to the forfeiture of over $450,000 worth of avionics equipment and accessories, and a $50,000 personal forfeiture judgment.\n\nOn March 19, Chistyakov, a former KanRus broker, was arrested in Riga, Latvia, for his role in the illegal smuggling scheme. Chistyakov remains detained in Latvia pending extradition proceedings.\n\nAs a result of today\u2019s guilty plea, Robertson faces a statutory maximum penalty of five years in prison for the conspiracy count, 20 years in prison for each of the two Export Control Reform Act counts, and 20 years in prison for the money laundering count. A sentencing hearing is scheduled for Oct. 3.\n\nThe FBI and the Department of Commerce\u2019s Office of Export Enforcement are investigating the case. The Latvian authorities are assisting the investigation. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection provided substantial assistance.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorneys Scott Rask and Ryan Huschka for the District of Kansas and Trial Attorney Adam Barry of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting the case. The Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs is providing valuable assistance.\n\nThe investigation was coordinated through the Justice Department\u2019s Task Force KleptoCapture, an interagency law enforcement task force dedicated to enforcing the sweeping sanctions, export controls and economic countermeasures that the United States, along with its foreign allies and partners, has imposed in response to Russia\u2019s unprovoked military invasion of Ukraine. Announced by the Attorney General on March 2, 2022, and under the leadership of the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, the task force will continue to leverage all of the department\u2019s tools and authorities to combat efforts to evade or undermine the collective actions taken by the U.S. government in response to Russian military aggression.",

        "text": "Trump\u2019s Attacks on DEI Reveal Administration's Agenda for Second Term\nThe 2024 Trump campaign\u2019s \u201canti-white racism\u201d rhetoric threatens to unravel decades of progress on racial equality and civil rights. The ACLU outlines our plan to fight back.\n\nThis piece was published before Joe Biden withdrew from the 2024 presidential election and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to represent the Democratic Party. No significant facts have been changed or added. When Donald Trump\u2019s administration ended in 2020, two-thirds of Americans believed that Trump had increased racial tensions in the U.S. The Trump administration's sustained assault on political, civic, and legal efforts to promote racial justice and the administration\u2019s transparent pursuit of an agenda based on white supremacy had pushed the country to its breaking point. Today, Trump and his supporters have doubled down on this agenda. As part of a larger backlash against racial justice efforts that ignited in the aftermath of the 2020 killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor, the 2025 Presidential Transition Project has now made its anti- diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies a cornerstone of their continued attacks on racial equity and free speech. In addition to abandoning civil rights enforcement on behalf of marginalized groups, Trump and his supporters plan to intensify right wing attacks on education, employment, and economic opportunity initiatives, and to censor academic discussions about race, gender, and systemic oppression. At the ACLU, we won\u2019t retreat. We\u2019re prepared to challenge the Trump administration\u2019s policies at every level of government. Learn more in our breakdown:\n\nTrump on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\n\nThe Facts: Based on Trump\u2019s campaign promises \u2013 and the detailed policy proposals of Project 2025 \u2013 we can expect a second Trump administration to supercharge efforts to reverse gains in civil rights and racial justice in America. Specifically, Trump has promised to continue his attacks on so-called \u201cdivisive concepts\u201d and take federal funding from schools with curricula, books, or classes that address race, racism, gender, and sexuality. Trump has also promised to eliminate school administrator positions that oversee DEI initiatives, and to resuscitate the discredited 1776 Commission, which was a presidential advisory committee created in September 2020 by then-President Trump that was tasked with \u201crestoring patriotic education in schools.\u201d Emboldened by the 2023 repeal of affirmative action in college admissions, a second Trump administration intends to abandon efforts to advance and legally defend affirmative action and DEI policies within military academies, federal minority contracting programs, and other federal programs shown to open opportunities \u2013 as well as create inclusive education and workplace environments \u2013 unfairly denied to people of color, women, and other marginalized groups. On the regulatory side, a second Trump administration would not only refuse to enforce civil rights regulations on behalf of individuals from historically marginalized groups, but to actively weaken these protections in housing, education, health care, and other essential resources. Ultimately, Trump has made clear that his goal is to eradicate all programs designed to address profound and persistent inequalities in American life \u2013 with the effect of further entrenching, and indeed worsening, systemic inequality. Why It Matters: Policies that seek to eradicate DEI programs, restrict conversations about race or gender in the classroom, or otherwise attack civil rights efforts are not only unlawful, but undermine our ability to repair decades of discriminatory practices and thrive as a nation. At the state level, we know that efforts to ban books or school curricula addressing the reality of systemic discrimination not only trample on students\u2019 and educators\u2019 constitutional rights, especially their First Amendment rights, but also threaten the retention and academic success of all students. At the federal level, we know that a second Trump administration would dismantle or refuse to enforce critical DEI programs and initiatives that date back decades. In public health, for example, there are significant disparities in care that are closely linked to structural racism. To remedy historical discrimination and address health outcome disparities, public and private scholarship and fellowship programs have been set up to support pathways to the medical profession for underrepresented medical professionals. Without support for these programs, the race-gap in healthcare would only widen.\n\nTrump on DEI and Anti-Discrimination Law The Trump campaign\u2019s rhetoric threatens to unravel decades of racial equality progress. We plan to fight back.\n\nSource: American Civil Liberties Union",

        "text": "Could Democrats replace President Joe Biden as the party's nominee?\nBiden is the only candidate who is eligible for nomination at this stage.\n\nUnless President Joe Biden removes himself from the 2024 presidential race, it's essentially impossible for any other candidate to earn the Democratic nomination, according to party rules. And even if he does leave, it would be challenging to confirm a replacement.\n\nFollowing Biden's debate performance on Thursday, a groundswell of panic from political observers -- including from some Democrats -- triggered discussion over the possibility of replacing Biden at the top of the party's ticket in November.\n\nBiden -- who has maintained he plans to remain in the race -- is set to soon be formally nominated as the Democratic presidential nominee. Biden will be nominated at a virtual convention between the dates of July 21 and Aug. 7, party members decided during a vote last month -- a move that rectifies a conflict over election deadlines in Ohio, which complicated the president's ballot access in that state. It also puts the virtual convention before the party's Aug. 19 in-person convention.\n\nIf Biden remains in the race, there is only one real option for forcibly ousting him as the nominee at this stage: for more than 1,976 out of the more than 3,894 individuals who have already selected to be Biden's pledged delegates to refrain from voting on for him on the first ballot during the Democratic National Committee's virtual nomination. Then, there would be a sort of \"brokered convention\" with the involvement of unpledged delegates on additional rounds of balloting.\n\nBut there are several reasons why this scenario would be far-fetched, including the will of delegates and the technicalities of several party rules.\n\nDemocrat candidate President Joe Biden speaks during a presidential debate with Republican candidate, former President Donald Trump, in Atlanta, on June 27, 2024. Brian Snyder/Reuters\n\nLongtime members of the party who have worked closely on writing rules changes in the past tell ABC News that they have been actively discussing how it would work to change rules should the nominee need to be replaced, however. And some DNC and state party members have argued that a delegate selection of the nominee, in the event of an open convention, would be hugely undemocratic because voters would not be involved in the process at this stage.\n\nIf Biden remains in the race\n\nMost of Biden's delegates, which were finalized at the completion of delegate selection on June 22, were chosen on a state-by-state basis as top supporters of the president and are unlikely to shift their backing, according to conversations between ABC News and national and state party leaders, along with seven individual delegates.\n\n\"That's not even remotely a topic of conversation,\" said Aaron Sims, a Biden delegate in Nevada, said of changing his vote from Biden.\n\n\"We were a little bit worried about [his debate], but we think that so far, he's run a really great campaign. You know, we're four months away from the election, and the idea of changing -- shifting to someone brand new that we have to introduce to the country, it would just be so much of a cluster that I don't think it's doable. I think ... we would actually be forfeiting the election if we did that,\" Sims added.\n\nThere is still technically a chance that any of these delegates could change their minds, however.\n\n\"I am still supporting President Biden until this moment,\" Sami Khaldi, a Biden delegate from Michigan, told ABC News.\n\nBut Khaldi added that he was \"definitely monitoring the situation very closely.\"\n\n\"If he will do much better on the campaign trail, we see that he's still a strong candidate, I'll support him. Otherwise, we will have a different discussion later on with the rest of the Democratic Party.\"\n\nAn LED sign located on the United Center displays a DNC 2024 logo and information outside the United Center, the venue for the upcoming Democratic National Convention (DNC), during a media walk through of the facility in Chicago, May 22, 2024. Jim Vondruska/Reuters, FILE\n\nUnlike Republican delegates, Democratic delegates are \"pledged\" rather than \"bound\" to a candidate, and party rules say that delegates \"shall in all good conscience\" reflect the views of those who elected them. There is no official penalty if a delegate votes differently.\n\nThe party could vote during one of their upcoming committee meetings to create some sort of penalty for pledged delegates who don't support Biden. But as of now, there will be no punishment.\n\nIf a Biden delegate sits out of the first round of balloting instead of backing the president, their vote would simply not count.\n\nBut if that delegate supports another candidate -- or even backs former candidate Dean Phillips, who earned three delegates from Ohio, or Jason Palmer, who earned three delegates from American Samoa, their votes would just be counted as \"present.\"\n\nThis is because Biden is the sole candidate who is officially eligible for nomination at this stage, according to the party, which cites party rules that will be formalized on Aug. 19.\n\nOne of the rules requires that a presidential candidate has \"established substantial support for their nomination,\" and has a proven track record as a Democrat who is faithful to the interests of the party. The rule states that the candidate must publicly affirm -- in writing -- that they are a Democrat, which comes with any of the other necessary eligibility requirements on a state level. That written affirmation needs to have been accepted by the DNC's Rules and Bylaws Committee, too.\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee Joe Biden delivers his acceptance speech on the fourth night of the Democratic National Convention from the Chase Center, Aug. 20, 2020, in Wilmington, Del. Win Mcnamee/Getty Images\n\nAnother rule echoes that sentiment, along with requiring the candidate must be registered to vote and that they were registered during the last election. It also means the candidate should be a bona fide Democrat \"as determined by the National Chairperson\" of the DNC.\n\nThe temporary rules also state that each nomination request must be accompanied by a petition including between 300 and 600 delegate signatures, not more than 50 of which may come from one delegation. A delegate may not sign more than one petition -- over 99% of delegates are pledged already to Biden so they would be unable to nominate another candidate.\n\nIf there were more \"present\" votes than Biden votes, the opportunity for a \"brokered\" convention arises (though virtually, as voting will take place). This would happen because Biden would be unable to secure the majority of the pledged delegates on the first ballot.\n\nBut the party would be at a loss for who they would be able to replace him, as no other candidate is eligible for nomination at this time.\n\nAgain, thousands of these pledged delegates would have to revolt in order to make any sort of impact on Biden's nomination.\n\n\"I don't anticipate there being a real groundswell of opposition at the convention. I mean, he has 99% of the pledged delegates. It would take, you know, thousands of delegates all converging and opposing him at once, against the sitting president of the United States,\" election law expert Derek Muller, a professor at Notre Dame, told ABC News.\n\nAnd because Biden's nomination will occur even earlier now (ahead of the party's in-person convention beginning on Aug. 19) -- and virtually -- Muller said the likelihood of any real opposition is even smaller.\n\n\"To the extent they're doing that even earlier and continue to adhere to that process, I think it's just deeply unlikely that it would result in anyone except Biden. Again, I think it really would take him voluntarily stepping down, for most -- for any of these serious scenarios to play out realistically,\" Muller said.\n\nIf Biden drops out\n\nOn the off-chance that Biden drops out of the race ahead of the nomination -- without a rule change -- many delegates who were assigned to Biden would likely go into the Democratic convention uncommitted, according to Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and member of the DNC.\n\nThese delegates would not automatically shift to Vice President Kamala Harris. The presidential and vice presidential ballots are separate at the Democratic convention.\n\nIndividual delegates would suddenly have a lot of influence on whom their party nominates.\n\nHarris -- as Biden's running mate -- would be a natural, even likely, destination for many Democratic delegates if Biden does leave the race.\n\nLara Brown, a political scientist and author of \"Jockeying for the American Presidency: The Political Opportunism of Aspirants,\" told ABC News in January that she does not believe that the Democratic convention would be all that contested in the event Biden passed away. There could be a symbolic first ballot vote for Biden, \"then essentially, [the convention could] create a point of order \u2026 and then do a second ballot,\" likely for Harris to be the nominee, Brown said.\n\nBut there remains the possibility of other options, including high-profile governors as well as members of Congress or Biden's cabinet.\n\nAn unclear variable still exists here, however, as no other candidate other than Biden is officially eligible for nomination without a party rule change.\n\nABC News' MaryAlice Parks and Oren Oppenheim contributed to this report.",

        "text": "A Bugatti, a first lady and the fake stories aimed at Americans\nA Bugatti car, a first lady and the fake stories aimed at Americans\n\nX John Mark Dougan, an American ex-cop, now lives in Moscow and runs a network of AI-powered fake news sites\n\nA network of Russia-based websites masquerading as local American newspapers is pumping out fake stories as part of an AI-powered operation that is increasingly targeting the US election, a BBC investigation can reveal. A former Florida police officer who relocated to Moscow is one of the key figures behind it. The following would have been a bombshell report - if it were true. Olena Zelenska, the first lady of Ukraine, allegedly bought a rare Bugatti Tourbillon sports car for 4.5m euros ($4.8m; \u00a33.8m) while visiting Paris for D-Day commemorations in June. The source of the funds was supposedly American military aid money. The story appeared on an obscure French website just days ago - and was swiftly debunked. Experts pointed out strange anomalies on the invoice posted online. A whistleblower cited in the story appeared only in an oddly edited video that may have been artificially created. Bugatti issued a sharp denial, calling it \"fake news\", and its Paris dealership threatened legal action against the people behind the false story. But before the truth could even get its shoes on, the lie had gone viral. Influencers had already picked up the false story and spread it widely. One X user, the pro-Russia, pro-Donald Trump activist Jackson Hinkle, posted a link seen by more than 6.5m people. Several other accounts spread the story to millions more X users \u2013 at least 12m in total, according to the site\u2019s metrics. It was a fake story, on a fake news website, designed to spread widely online, with its origins in a Russia-based disinformation operation BBC Verify first revealed last year - at which point the operation appeared to be trying to undermine Ukraine\u2019s government.\n\nSeveral errors - including spelling mistakes, punctuation and the use of English - were noticed on this fake invoice. But it still spread widely online\n\nOur latest investigation, carried out over more than six months and involving the examination of hundreds of articles across dozens of websites, found that the operation has a new target - American voters. Dozens of bogus stories tracked by the BBC appear aimed at influencing US voters and sowing distrust ahead of November\u2019s election. Some have been roundly ignored but others have been shared by influencers and members of the US Congress. The story of the Bugatti hit many of the top themes of the operation \u2013 Ukrainian corruption, US aid spending, and the inner workings of French high society. Another fake which went viral earlier this year was more directly aimed at American politics. It was published on a website called The Houston Post \u2013 one of dozens of sites with American-sounding names which are in reality run from Moscow - and alleged that the FBI illegally wiretapped Donald Trump\u2019s Florida resort. It played neatly into Trump\u2019s allegations that the legal system is unfairly stacked against him, that there is a conspiracy to thwart his campaign, and that his opponents are using dirty tricks to undermine him. Mr Trump himself has accused the FBI of snooping on his conversations. Experts say that the operation is just one part of a much larger ongoing effort, led from Moscow, to spread disinformation during the US election campaign. While no hard evidence has emerged that these particular fake news websites are run by the Russian state, researchers say the scale and sophistication of the operation is broadly similar to previous Kremlin-backed efforts to spread disinformation in the West. \u201cRussia will be involved in the US 2024 election, as will others,\u201d said Chris Krebs, who as the director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency was responsible for ensuring the integrity of the 2020 presidential election. \u201cWe're already seeing them - from a broader information operations perspective on social media and elsewhere - enter the fray, pushing against already contentious points in US politics,\u201d he said. The BBC contacted the Russian Foreign Ministry and Russia\u2019s US and UK embassies, but received no response. We also attempted to contact Mr Hinkle for comment.\n\nHow the fakes spread\n\nChicago Chronicle The real Chicago Chronicle (top) had its heyday in the late 1800s. Below, the logo of the fake news site which appeared online in the last few months\n\nSince state-backed disinformation campaigns and money-making \u201cfake news\u201d operations attracted attention during the 2016 US election campaign, disinformation merchants have had to get more creative both in spreading their content and making it seem credible. The operation investigated by BBC Verify uses artificial intelligence to generate thousands of news articles, posted to dozens of sites with names meant to sound quintessentially American \u2013 Houston Post, Chicago Crier, Boston Times, DC Weekly and others. Some use the names of real newspapers that went out of business years or decades ago.\n\nMost of the stories on these sites are not outright fakes. Instead, they are based on real news stories from other sites apparently rewritten by artificial intelligence software. In some instances, instructions to the AI engines were visible on the finished stories, such as: \u201cPlease rewrite this article taking a conservative stance\u201d.\n\nAn example of instructions to an AI program - mistakenly left on a story on one of the fake news sites\n\nThe stories are attributed to hundreds of fake journalists with made-up names and in some cases, profile pictures taken from elsewhere on the internet. For instance, a photo of best-selling writer Judy Batalion was used on multiple stories on a website called DC Weekly, \u201cwritten\u201d by an online persona called \u201cJessica Devlin\u201d. \u201cI was totally confused,\u201d Ms Batalion told the BBC. \u201cI still don't really understand what my photo was doing on this website.\u201d Ms Batalion said she assumed the photo had been copied and pasted from her LinkedIn profile. \u201cI had no contact with this website,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's made me more self-conscious about the fact that any photo of yourself online can be used by someone else.\u201d\n\nJudy Batalion Judy Batalion had nothing to do with the fake news operation, but her photo was one of several that were copied-and-pasted from elsewhere on the internet in order to make the network's reporters seem real.\n\nThe sheer number of stories - thousands each week - along with their repetition across different websites, indicates that the process of posting AI-generated content is automated. Casual browsers could easily come away with the impression that the sites are thriving sources of legitimate news about politics and hot-button social issues. However, interspersed within this tsunami of content is the real meat of the operation - fake stories aimed increasingly at American audiences. The stories often blend American and Ukrainian political issues - for instance one claimed that a worker for a Ukrainian propaganda outfit was dismayed to find that she was assigned tasks designed to knock down Donald Trump and bolster President Biden. Another report invented a New York shopping trip made by Ukraine\u2019s first lady, and alleged she was racist towards staff at a jewellery store. The BBC has found that forged documents and fake YouTube videos were used to bolster both false stories. Some of the fakes break out and get high rates of engagement on social media, said Clement Briens, senior threat intelligence analyst at cybersecurity company Recorded Future. His company says that 120 websites were registered by the operation - which it calls CopyCop - over just three days in May. And the network is just one of a number of Russia-based disinformation operations. Other experts - at Microsoft, Clemson University, and at Newsguard, a company that tracks misinformation sites - have also been tracking the network. Newsguard says it has counted at least 170 sites connected to the operation. \u201cInitially, the operation seemed small,\u201d said McKenzie Sadeghi, Newsguard\u2019s AI and foreign influence editor. \u201cAs each week passed it seemed to be growing significantly in terms of size and reach. People in Russia would regularly cite and boost these narratives, via Russian state TV, Kremlin officials and Kremlin influencers. \u201cThere's about a new narrative originating from this network almost every week or two,\u201d she said.\n\nMaking the fake appear real\n\nTo further bolster the credibility of the fake stories, operatives create YouTube videos, often featuring people who claim to be \u201cwhistleblowers\u201d or \u201cindependent journalists\u201d. In some cases the videos are narrated by actors \u2013 in others it appears they are AI-generated voices. Several of the videos appear to be shot against a similar-looking background, further suggesting a co-ordinated effort to spread fake news stories. The videos aren\u2019t themselves meant to go viral, and have very few views on YouTube. Instead, the videos are quoted as \u201csources\u201d and cited in text stories on the fake newspaper websites.\n\nYouTube The fake YouTube 'whistleblower' who was cited as a source in the false story about the alleged FBI wiretap of Donald Trump\n\nFor instance, the story about the Ukrainian information operation allegedly targeting the Trump campaign cited a YouTube video which purported to include shots from an office in Kyiv, where fake campaign posters were visible on the walls. Links to the stories are then posted on Telegram channels and other social media accounts. Eventually, the sensational \u201cscoops\u201d - which, like the Trump wiretap story and a slew of earlier stories about Ukrainian corruption, often repeat themes already popular among patriotic Russians and some supporters of Donald Trump - can reach both Russian influencers and audiences in the West. Although only a few rise to the highest levels of prominence, some have spread to millions \u2013 and to powerful people. A story which originated on DC Weekly, claiming that Ukrainian officials bought yachts with US military aid, was repeated by several members of Congress, including Senator J D Vance and Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene. Mr Vance is one of a handful of politicians mentioned as a potential vice-presidential running mate for Donald Trump.\n\nThe former US cop\n\nOne of the key people involved in the operation is John Mark Dougan, a former US Marine who worked as a police officer in Florida and Maine in the 2000s. Mr Dougan later set up a website designed to collect leaked information about his former employer, the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office. In a harbinger of his activities in Russia, Mr Dougan\u2019s site published authentic information including the home addresses of police officers, alongside fake stories and rumours. The FBI raided his apartment in 2016, at which point he fled to Moscow. He has since written books, reported from occupied parts of Ukraine and has made appearances on Russian think tank panels, at military events and on a TV station owned by Russia\u2019s ministry of defence. In text message conversations with the BBC, Mr Dougan has flatly denied being involved with the websites. On Tuesday, he denied any knowledge of the story about the Bugatti sports car. But at other times he has bragged about his prowess in spreading fake news. At one point he also implied that his activities are a form of revenge against American authorities. \u201cFor me it\u2019s a game,\" he said. \u201cAnd a little payback.\u201d At another point he said: \u201cMy YouTube channel received many strikes for misinformation\u201d for his reporting from Ukraine, raising the prospect of his channel being taken offline. \u201cSo if they want to say misinformation, well, let\u2019s do it right,\u201d he texted.\n\nX (Twitter) Mr Dougan has chronicled his trips to Ukraine on his social media feeds and on appearances on Russian state TV\n\nA large body of digital evidence also shows connections between the former police officer and the Russia-based websites. The BBC and experts we consulted traced IP addresses and other digital information back to websites run by Dougan. At one point a story on the DC Weekly site, written in response to a New York Times piece which mentioned Dougan, was attributed to \u201cAn American Citizen, the owner of these sites,\u201d and stated: \u201cI am the owner, an American citizen, a US military veteran, born and raised in the United States.\u201d The article signed off with Dougan\u2019s email address. Shortly after we reported on Mr Dougan\u2019s activities in a previous story, a fake version of the BBC website briefly appeared online. It was linked through digital markers to his network.\n\nMr Dougan is most likely not the only person working on the influence operation and who funds it remains unclear. \u201cI think it's important not to overplay his role in this campaign,\" said Darren Linvill, co-director of Clemson University\u2019s Media Forensic Hub, which has been tracking the network. \u201cHe may be just a bit of a bit player and a useful dupe, because he's an American.\u201d Despite his appearances on state-run media and at government-linked think tanks, Mr Dougan denies he is being paid by the Kremlin. \u201cI have never been paid a single dime by the Russian government,\u201d he said via text message.\n\nTargeting the US election\n\nThe operation that Dougan is involved in has increasingly shifted its focus from stories about the war in Ukraine to stories about American and British politics. The false article about the FBI and the alleged wiretap at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort was one of the first stories produced by the network that was entirely about US politics, with no mention of Ukraine or Russia. Clint Watts, who leads Microsoft\u2019s Digital Threat Analysis Center, said that the operation often blends together issues with salience both in Ukraine and the West. Mr Watts said that the volume of content being posted and the increasing sophistication of Russia-based efforts could potentially pose a significant problem in the run-up to November\u2019s election. \u201cThey're not getting mass distribution every single time,\u201d he said, but noted that several attempts made each week could lead to false narratives taking hold in the \u201cinformation ocean\u201d of a major election campaign. \u201cIt can have an outsized impact\", and stories from the network can take off very quickly, he said. \u201cGone are the days of Russia purchasing ads in roubles, or having pretty obvious trolls that are sitting in a factory in St. Petersburg,\u201d said Nina Jankowicz, head of the American Sunlight Project, a non-profit organisation attempting to combat the spread of disinformation. Ms Jankowicz was briefly director of the short-lived US Disinformation Governance Board, a branch of the Department of Homeland Security designed to tackle false information. \u201cNow we're seeing a lot more information laundering,\u201d she said - using a term referring to the recycling of fake or misleading stories into the mainstream in order to obscure their ultimate source.\n\nWhere it goes next\n\nYouTube A YouTube video narrated by an AI-generated voice was planted as the source for the false story that Mr Zelensky bought a \u00a320m mansion from King Charles III\n\nMicrosoft researchers also say the operation is attempting to spread stories about UK politics \u2013 with an eye on Thursday\u2019s general election \u2013 and the Paris Olympics. One fake story \u2013 which appeared on the website called the London Crier \u2013 claimed that Mr Zelensky bought a mansion owned by King Charles III at a bargain price. It was seen by hundreds of thousands of users on X, and shared by an official Russian embassy account. YouTube removed an AI-narrated video posted by an obscure channel that was used as the source of the false story after it was flagged by BBC Verify. And Mr Dougan hinted at even bigger plans when asked whether increased attention on his activities would slow the spread of his false stories. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he said, \u201cthe game is being upped.\u201d",

The selections through the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program will help state, Tribal, local and territorial governments address current and future risks from natural disasters including extreme heat, wildfires, drought, hurricanes, earthquakes and increased flooding.\n\n\u201cEvery American community faces risks from extreme weather, and the DHS workforce and our partners across the Administration will always be there for communities in their time of need,\u201d said Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas. \u201cInvesting in preparedness and resilience today can help keep our country safe tomorrow. Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program grants are a lifeline for communities across the country, funding projects big and small -- from major flood mitigation projects to shaded bus shelters. The impact of these projects will ultimately be measured in lives saved and disasters averted.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already seen an unprecedented level of extreme weather events this season, and with more expected on the way, we\u2019re encouraged to see increased interest in communities applying for FEMA\u2019s BRIC program,\u201d said FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell. \u201cThanks to extra funding from President Biden\u2019s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, FEMA is now better situated to help communities, especially those that are disadvantaged and disproportionately impacted by climate change, invest in resilience. FEMA will remain focused on getting these critical infrastructure dollars to the communities that need it the most.\u201d\n\nThis effort highlights the importance of FEMA\u2019s continued commitment to putting \u201cpeople first\u201d and helping communities, families, and businesses build climate resilience. It also aligns with the 2024 FEMA Year of Resilience theme to build capacity to withstand tomorrow\u2019s hazards.\n\nTo strengthen America\u2019s climate resilience, President Biden secured more than $50 billion for climate resilience and adaptation through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act and established a National Climate Resilience Framework, which is advancing locally tailored, community-driven climate resilience strategies. President Biden\u2019s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law contributed approximately $398 million to today\u2019s announcement. Overall, the President\u2019s Investing in America agenda provides FEMA nearly $7 billion to help communities proactively reduce their vulnerability to climate-fueled events and natural hazards.\n\nOf the approximately $674 million in 56 national competition selections, more than half of the selections use nature-based solutions and other natural ways to combat climate change, restore and protect wetlands and to harness nature to enhance climate resilience. FEMA announced this funding opportunity in October 2023 alongside an $800 million Flood Mitigation Assistance opportunity. Selections for Flood Mitigation Assistance will be made later this year.\n\nThis year\u2019s selections cover a variety of natural hazards, including extreme heat, flooding and earthquakes. The top three funded project types are:\n\nFlood control for $395 million across 28 projects, designed to eliminate or reduce flood damage;\n\nUtility and infrastructure protection for $237 million across 30 projects, like elevating pumping stations, enhancing power poles, strengthening water towers and floodproofing utility plants;\n\nBuilding code-related projects for $55 million across 129 projects for enforcement and adoption of more modern, hazard-resistant building codes. This is the greatest number of projects FEMA has ever selected for building code-related activities in a grant cycle. These funds were reserved as a non-competitive set-aside for states, Tribes and territories, resulting in a 180% increase in requests for adoption and enforcement funding.\n\nBelow is a sample of selections from across the nation of projects that cover these hazards. The full list of selections can be found at FEMA.gov:\n\nThe Eastwick Near-Term Flood Barrier Project, led by the Philadelphia Office of Sustainability, will boost resilience by mitigating flood risks in Eastwick. Eastwick, a previous recipient of non-financial BRIC technical assistance, is vulnerable to a number of flooding sources.\n\nShaded bus shelters in Washington, D.C. will mitigate the effects of extreme heat. The project will install 20 shaded bus stops in urban heat islands to ensure bus users can access this essential community service during extreme heat days. By targeting public transit, the project will safeguard residents as they commute to work, run errands, fulfill other daily obligations and help to protect historically low-income communities from the effects of extreme heat.\n\nThe East Elmhurst Cloudburst project in New York City will use innovative control measures to manage extreme stormwater events and reduce local flooding. These include porous concrete parking and bike lanes, as well as green infrastructure and on-site storage.\n\nThe Magalia Dam retrofit project in Paradise, California, will build seismic resilience. The project will reinforce the dam to better withstand earthquakes so the dam can continue providing its critical benefits.\n\nThe Slaughterhouse Creek Flood Mitigation project in Montana will include channel improvements and culvert replacements. The project will have an improved channel designed to contain flooding.\n\nWest Virginia is a first-time BRIC national competition applicant. The Rand Flooding Storm Sewer Improvements project will upgrade community infrastructure to address critical drainage issues.\n\nThe Southern Crisfield Flood Mitigation. Crisfield, Maryland -- a previous selection for Direct Technical Assistance -- aims to boost resilience by improving flood protection through a 5-mile-long tidal flood protection barrier and a new internal drainage system. This project will improve flood protection, stormwater management and wetland health.\n\nDecatur, Georgia, make major roadways safer from floods and improve access for emergency vehicles. The current culverts can lead to roads becoming impassable or washed-out during storms. This grant will upgrade culverts on major roadways to stay open during severe weather.\n\nA blend of nature-based solutions and infrastructure improvements will boost flood resilience along the Big Ditch stream corridor in the city of Goldsboro, North Carolina. The project will upgrade road culverts and expand a restored floodplain. This will make homes safer from flooding as well as improve water quality and provide new wildlife habitat and more equitable access to recreational resources.\n\nAssistance for States, Territories and Tribal Nations\n\nBeyond the national competition, FEMA selected an additional 600 projects totaling $208 million. In addition to a maximum $2 million for every state and territory, these funds also include approximately $55 million for building code activities and $67 million for Tribal Nations. Another $116 million for states, Tribes, territories and the District of Columbia to administer these grants brings to the total to $1 billion. For a complete list of selections, visit FEMA.gov.\n\nFEMA is also announcing 93 Tribes, local communities and territories across all 10 FEMA regions that will receive non-financial direct technical assistance to help build community-wide resilience through the BRIC program. This more than doubles the number of recipients from last year. Through the Direct Technical Assistance program, FEMA will provide guidance to disadvantaged communities facing climate risks to ensure no community is left behind in the opportunity to build climate resilience. For a full list of communities, visit FEMA.gov.\n\nTrends in Equity, Extreme Heat, Nature-Based Solutions and Other Top Funded Projects\n\nThese selections further underscore the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s commitment to equity and environmental justice. These awards will assist the most disadvantaged communities in building resilience to climate change and extreme weather events like hurricanes, flooding, tornadoes and extreme heat.\n\nExtreme Heat: Among the 656 projects, 12 selections will mitigate the effects of extreme heat for a total of nearly $13 million. In addition to the shaded bus stops in Washington, D.C, other examples include providing resilient power systems to places like saferooms and senior living and medical facilities that provide climate control. Given the growing risks posed by extreme heat impacts, FEMA encourages more States, Tribes and territories to apply for extreme heat projects during future grant cycles.\n\nJustice 40: Of the available funding, $587 million is benefitting Justice40 communities that are overburdened by pollution and marginalized by underinvestment. The Biden-Harris Administration's Justice40 Initiative aims to deliver 40% of funding to these communities. Since 2020, FEMA has seen an upward trend of exceeding its Justice40 goals. This year, disadvantaged communities accounted for 67% of the total selections and 70% of the national competition.\n\nCommunity Disaster Resilience Zones: Additionally, $127 million will benefit Community Disaster Resilience Zones. The Community Disaster Resilience Zones Act -- signed into law by President Biden in 2022 -- allows FEMA to identify U.S. Census tracts that are most at risk from the effects of natural hazards and climate change.\n\nNature-Based Solutions: For this grant cycle, 57% of selected projects incorporate nature-based solutions -- practices that weave natural features or processes into the built environment to promote resilience -- across nine FEMA regions. About 84% of those nature-based solution projects will be in Economically Disadvantaged Rural Communities, Community Disaster Resilience Zones or disadvantaged communities.",

        "text": "American Pride Remains Near Record Low\nRepublicans continue to express more pride in the U.S. than Democrats and independents\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. -- Two in five Americans, 41%, say they are \u201cextremely proud\u201d to be American, the fifth consecutive year this reading has been in the 38% to 43% range. Another 26% of U.S. adults say they are \u201cvery proud,\u201d also in line with recent years.\n\nThe 67% combined share of Americans who are extremely or very proud is consistent with readings since 2018 and among the lowest in Gallup\u2019s trend, just four percentage points above the record low of 63% in 2020. From 2001 through 2017, no fewer than 75% of U.S. adults said they were extremely or very proud, including majorities who were extremely proud.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nThe latest data are from a June 3-23 Gallup poll, which finds 18% of Americans say they are \u201cmoderately proud\u201d to be American, while 10% say they are \u201conly a little\u201d proud and 5% are \u201cnot at all\u201d proud.\n\nAmericans\u2019 national pride was highest after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001, when patriotism surged in the U.S. Extreme pride has been trending downward since 2015.\n\nMajority of Republicans, but Fewer Democrats and Independents, Extremely Proud\n\nRepublicans\u2019 pride in America has consistently outpaced that of Democrats, while independents\u2019 views have been closer to Democrats\u2019. Currently, 59% of Republicans, 34% of Democrats and 36% of independents say they are extremely proud to be American. The 25-point gap in extreme pride between Republicans and Democrats today is similar to the 28-point average gap since 2001. The latest difference between the two parties is less than half of the record-high gap -- 54 points in 2019 -- when an all-time low of 22% of Democrats expressed extreme pride.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans\u2019 current extreme pride is statistically tied with the group\u2019s 58% record low in 2022. Similarly, the percentage of independents with extreme national pride is near last year\u2019s 33%, the lowest for that group.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile the percentage of U.S. adults who say they are extremely proud to be American is near the lowest point on record, about two-thirds continue to be at least very proud. Republicans\u2019 national pride, though near its lowest point, remains high compared with Democrats\u2019 and independents\u2019, although all party groups are significantly less proud than they were 20 years ago.\n\nTo stay up to date with the latest Gallup News insights and updates, follow us on X @Gallup.\n\nLearn more about how the Gallup Poll Social Series works.\n\nView complete question responses and trends (PDF download).\n\n###Embeddable###",

        "text": "High court ruling on presidential immunity threatens the rule of law, scholars warn\nA U.S. Supreme Court decision Monday granting presidents broad immunity from prosecution gives those leaders the power to commit crimes under the guise of official action, posing a direct threat to democracy and the rule of law, UC Berkeley scholars said.\n\nIn a 6-3 ruling, the high court\u2019s conservative majority found that the nation\u2019s chief executive cannot be held legally liable for actions taken within the scope of official, core constitutional duties. Further, the justices ruled, courts cannot explore a president\u2019s motives when assessing whether a president had broken the law.\n\nErwin Chemerinsky Berkeley Law photo\n\nIn effect, the scholars said, the court put the president largely above the law in a way that was never written into the U.S. Constitution or established in more than 200 years of legal precedent. That could precipitate a crisis in the near term, they said, if former President Donald Trump wins re-election in November and uses the new protections with impunity to pursue his political opponents.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t expect such a broad definition of absolute immunity for a president for criminal acts,\u201d said Berkeley Law Dean Erwin Chemerinsky, one of the nation\u2019s preeminent constitutional scholars. \u201cWhile the court leaves many issues unresolved, it is a dramatic and stunning affirmation of broad, absolute immunity for a president.\u201d\n\nBerkeley political scientist Terri Bimes, a scholar in the history and operation of the U.S. presidency, called the court\u2019s ruling \u201cdangerous.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe decision seems to permit the president to use the power of the office to commit acts that are illegal, that are criminal,\u201d Bimes said. \u201cThe fact that these actions are being taken in the name of the presidency, that they\u2019re official acts, makes them immune from prosecution. That is really problematic.\u201d\n\nTerri Bimes Brittany Hosea-Small for UC Berkeley\n\nBroadly considered, they said, the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling could fundamentally change the presidency, dramatically increasing its power and making the nation more vulnerable to authoritarian leaders who might pursue power by any means necessary.\n\nThe ruling issued Monday was the culmination of a Supreme Court term in which the court majority advanced a range of conservative and right-wing interests: on gun rights, environmental protection, and on the federal system that regulates everything from health care to food safety and climate change.\n\nThe case of Trump v. United States arose after the former president was indicted in federal court for using a variety of legal maneuvers and political arm-twisting in an effort to overturn his loss to Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 election.\n\nTrump sought to dismiss the indictments, arguing that he had absolute immunity because he was acting in his official capacity as president. But both the U.S.. District Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals rejected his arguments, saying that presidents are not above the law.\n\nFor Trump, a legal win \u2014 and a political win\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s majority \u2014 with three of the six conservatives appointed in Trump\u2019s single term \u2014 determined that a president of any party needs assurance of broad immunity to carry out decisions without fear of political retaliation.\n\nIf the president were to call out the Navy Seals to assassinate a political rival, since he\u2019s using his power as commander in chief, that would be absolute immunity. Erwin Chemerinsky\n\nYesterday\u2019s ruling gave presidents immunity for official acts, and said explicitly that the president\u2019s motives were not relevant as they usually would be in a criminal prosecution.\n\n\u201cIf the president were to call out the Navy Seals to assassinate a political rival, since he\u2019s using his power as commander in chief, that would be absolute immunity,\u201d Chemerinsky explained. \u201cThe president could use the Department of Justice to seek retribution and engage in politically motivated prosecutions \u2014 that would be protected by absolute immunity.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s certainly a gray area in terms of things that are at the outer reaches of a president\u2019s power. But even there, the Supreme Court says there\u2019s presumptive absolute immunity.\u201d\n\nIn Trump\u2019s specific case, that would seem to remove legal liability for pressuring Mike Pence, when he was vice president, to not certify the 2020 election, Chemerinsky said, or for urging supporters to march on the Capitol as the certification was taking place.\n\nBerkeley scholars suggested that new U.S. Supreme Court ruling would give a re-elected President Donald Trump wide authority to engage in corrupt, anti-democratic behavior. White House photo by Tia Dufour\n\nThe court suggested Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure state officials to change the vote outcome in their states might not have been an official act, because it was not part of his official duties. It sent the case back to the District Court to reassess the indictments, all but assuring that the cases would not be resolved before this November\u2019s election.\n\nFears of a president unleashed and unrestrained\n\nThe outcome left both Chemerinsky and Bimes worried about how the former president would proceed if he\u2019s re-elected.\n\nThis ruling seems to suggest that if the president is acting in his official capacity, then it\u2019s OK to engage in election subversion. \u2026 I think that\u2019s dangerous. Terri Bimes\n\nSaid Chemerinsky: \u201cWhen it comes to Donald Trump, who has threatened to use the Justice Department for retribution, he now knows that no matter how baseless his political motive, he has absolute immunity.\u201d\n\nFor example, if he is returned to the White House, he could order the Justice Department to drop the investigation. Or he could pardon himself.\n\n\u201cIf he does win,\u201d Bimes said, \u201cin his second term, we could see a power-hungry Donald Trump unleashed from norms and really pushing to make the presidential office his own, and to do his own bidding.\n\n\u201cThis ruling seems to suggest that if the president is acting in his official capacity, then it\u2019s OK to engage in election subversion. \u2026 I think that\u2019s dangerous.\u201d\n\nMore broadly, Bimes worried that the court\u2019s decision could transform the office and the power of the presidency far beyond Trump, giving the president enormous powers never before defined or enumerated in the Constitution.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the ideal imagined by the nation\u2019s founders, she said. In the early days of the nation, the president was expected to be a leader of elevated integrity.\n\n\u201cThey just fought the Revolutionary War against King George III,\u201d she recounted. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want a monarch. They didn\u2019t want an executive who was above the law.\u201d\n\nInstead, the founders envisioned a sort of \u201cpatriot king,\u201d she explained, \u201ca president who would be above the fray, who would not be engaged in factional conflicts, would not be going after his enemies.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, she continued, \u201cthere was this idea that Congress was more powerful than the presidency. It was the president who should be deferential to the Congress. That\u2019s no longer the case.\u201d\n\nIf the courts don\u2019t restrain a rogue president, who will?\n\nIn modern times, the presidency has accumulated more power \u2014 enough to make the office practically independent of Congress and of political parties. The personal character and integrity of the president becomes essential, and without that, there are fewer constraints on unethical or corrupt actions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more of a personal office,\u201d Bimes said. \u201cThe president can use all the powers of the presidency for whatever he wants.\u201d\n\nThat also separates the president from accountability. Trump and his allies have been able to undermine the electoral process through constant, false claims of fraud, Bimes said.

        "text": "Donald Trump, Joe Biden and dementia: Why not to diagnose from a distance\n4 reasons NOT to diagnose dementia from afar\n\n1. The diagnosis often wrong\n\nThere are lots of reasons why a person may appear momentarily confused or forgetful, show poor judgement, or behave strangely.\n\n\n\nSometimes there may be a medical reason, but often there is a straightforward explanation that doesn\u2019t require them to have a neurological condition. They may be tired or jet-lagged, they may have had a glass of wine, they may have an infection, or they may just not have a very good grasp of the topic being discussed. These are all perfectly possible without the need to raise dementia.\n\nDementia is a very specific form of cognitive impairment \u2013 just one of many possible reasons why someone might not be able to think or remember things clearly.\n\nA diagnosis of dementia can only be made after a thorough assessment by a health professional. This involves taking a detailed medical history, carrying out a range of tests, and most often arranging a brain scan.\n\nIt\u2019s not possible to diagnose a person just by watching them on TV. It\u2019s fine to say that a candidate appears to be struggling, or that they seem forgetful or confused. However, it\u2019s not possible to reliably state the underlying cause of these problems without a proper clinical assessment.\n\n2. It stigmatises people living with dementia\n\nWhen an older politician is accused of having dementia, it\u2019s often done to smear their character, question their policies, or seek to disqualify them from holding office. The tone tends to be negative, demeaning and often hateful \u2013 particularly on social media platforms.\n\n\n\nThis reinforces outdated stereotypes of dementia being a condition that, of itself, disqualifies a person from participating in their community or having a voice that\u2019s worth listening to.\n\nHearing dementia being weaponised in this way is both hurtful and unhelpful to people with dementia and their families, who live with the condition every day and often struggle to have their voices heard.\n\nWe want a society in which people living with dementia feel understood, valued, and able to play an active role in their community. This is not helped when people use unsubstantiated allegations of dementia or mental health conditions to belittle or humiliate politicians they don\u2019t like or agree with.\n\n3. It normalises unhelpful language\n\nAs with any sensitive medical condition, the language we use around dementia is important. Language affects the way that people living with dementia are treated by others.\n\nAllegations of dementia in the media often contain lazy or outdated medical terms like \u2018demented\u2019, \u2018senile\u2019, or \u2018addled\u2019. These terms are no longer used by dementia professionals because our understanding of the condition has now advanced well beyond these crude terms.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, they continue to be used in the media, which makes it harder for people to have a proper understanding of what dementia is. This can have a real impact when it comes to getting a diagnosis and then discussing it with family and friends.\n\n\n\nPeople don\u2019t want to be thought of as \u2018senile\u2019 or \u2018losing their marbles\u2019. They want to be supported to live well with a devastating brain disease.\n\n\n\nIf someone does have a diagnosis of dementia, we need to still see them as a person worthy of inclusion, dignity and respect. We should never use their dementia as a label to define or devalue who they are.\n\n4. Diagnosing without a proper medical assessment is unethical\n\nThe current likely presidential candidates, Joe Biden and Donald Trump, are by no means the first politicians to be challenged about dementia or their mental health.\n\n\n\nIn 1964, a magazine article was written about presidential candidate Barry Goldwater that carried the headline \u201c1,189 Psychiatrists say Goldwater is Psychologically Unfit to be President!\u201d The article quoted an informal poll of US psychiatrists, none of whom had actually met the candidate.\n\n\n\nGoldwater lost the election and successfully sued the magazine for making untrue allegations. Out of this case came the \u2018Goldwater Rule\u2019, which to this day strongly discourages psychiatrists from trying to diagnose a person without ever meeting them or doing a proper assessment.\n\n\n\nThe rule states: \u201c...it is unethical for a psychiatrist to offer a professional opinion unless he or she has conducted an examination and has been granted proper authorization for such a statement.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlthough the Goldwater Rule is often broken, it remains an essential piece of ethical guidance for any health professional or expert who might be tempted to diagnose a person without ever meeting them.",

The Center will again bring its expertise to the November 2024 U.S. election.\n\nThe Center\u2019s work emphasizes strengthening trust in the U.S. election system and encouraging citizens to address disagreements in a civil manner.\n\n\u201cThe environment in the United States has changed in ways that have prompted us to expand our programming,\u201d said Barbara Smith, the Carter Center\u2019s vice president of peace programs. \u201cWe believe we can help forge a better path for American democracy than what we\u2019ve seen in recent years.\u201d\n\nThe Carter Center has a hard-earned reputation as a fair, impartial observer of elections overseas. It brought its electoral expertise to a U.S. election for the first time by observing Georgia\u2019s post-election risk-limiting audit in 2020, and its domestic focus has grown ever since.\n\nA Georgia voter marks her ballot in November 2022. The Carter Center is working to give U.S. voters confidence in the electoral system for this November.\n\nWhile not taking political positions itself, the Center for the past three years has been recruiting right-leaning and left-leaning leaders in six swing states \u2014 Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, and Wisconsin \u2014 to bring all kinds of Americans together for civil, fact-based discussions about issues.\n\n\u201cFor too many Americans, the hallmarks of U.S. politics today are polarization, misinformation, disinformation, and distrust of election systems,\u201d said David Carroll, director of the Center\u2019s Democracy Program . \u201cOne way we hope to help is by demystifying the electoral process and highlighting its safeguards.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy did people riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021? Because they thought they were being disenfranchised,\u201d said Nathan Stock, Conflict Resolution Program associate director. \u201cSo what do you do about that? One step is to get trusted messengers to pass on better information about the nature of American elections.\u201d\n\nThe goal is to correct misinformation, search for common ground, and reduce fear of our fellow Americans.\n\n\u201cWe want people on opposite sides to acknowledge one another as human beings,\u201d Stock said. \u201cThey probably won\u2019t ever agree on the Second Amendment or abortion rights, but they can agree that protecting the functioning of our democratic republic is important.\u201d\n\nThe Carter Center recognizes the role that faith communities can play in the effort. It is building a network of religious leaders to work with their congregations to promote healthy conversations and tamp down dehumanizing language.\n\nThe Center\u2019s work has a legal angle as well, partnering with law schools and legal associations to provide lawyers in Georgia, Arizona, and Wisconsin with election-specific knowledge and skills. The effort aims to create a cadre of \u201ccitizen lawyers\u201d who can speak knowledgeably and persuasively about election processes in a way that helps restore public confidence in our elections\u2019 integrity and results, said Randolph Kent, associate director of the Center\u2019s Rule of Law Program.\n\nOn the front lines of that system are election workers, who have been subjected to threats and harassment in recent years. Recognizing the stress of the role, the Center has published a mental health wellness guide just for them.\n\nAs it always has, The Carter Center supports a set of widely accepted international election standards. These include ensuring that all citizens have an equal opportunity to exercise their voting rights. To that end, the Center backs efforts to ensure that voters with disabilities can access polling places, and to secure voting rights for Native Americans and people returning from incarceration.\n\nThe Carter Center also is working to demonstrate the important role that nonpartisan election observers can play in several U.S. states, with plans to support state-based actors in Montana, New Mexico, and California. The Center will provide guidelines and instruction to local organizations working to observe elections in these states.\n\n\u201cWe hope that these nonpartisan groups will provide well-documented public reports and actionable feedback and recommendations on how to improve electoral processes,\u201d Carroll said.\n\nRelated Resources\n\nCarter Center Democracy Program\n\nUnited States Elections",

        "text": "Justices rule Trump has some immunity from prosecution\nOPINION ANALYSIS\n\nJustices rule Trump has some immunity from prosecution\n\nBy Amy Howe\n\nat 12:26 pm\n\nThe justices handed a significant victory to former President Donald Trump in Trump v. United States on Monday. (Katie Barlow)\n\nThis article was updated on July 1 at 3:32 p.m.\n\nIn a historic decision, a divided Supreme Court on Monday ruled that former presidents can never be prosecuted for actions relating to the core powers of their office, and that there is at least a presumption that they have immunity for their official acts more broadly.\n\nThe decision left open the possibility that the charges brought against former President Donald Trump by Special Counsel Jack Smith \u2013 alleging that Trump conspired to overturn the results of the 2020 election \u2013 can still go forward to the extent that the charges are based on his private conduct, rather than his official acts.\n\nThe case now returns to the lower courts for them to determine whether the conduct at the center of the charges against Trump was official or unofficial \u2013 an inquiry that, even if it leads to the conclusion that the charges can proceed, will almost certainly further delay any trial in the case, which had originally been scheduled to begin on March 4, 2024 but is currently on hold.\n\nWriting for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts emphasized that the president \u201cis not above the law.\u201d But Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in a dissent joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, countered that if a future president \u201cmisuses official power for personal gain, the criminal law that the rest of us must abide will not provide a backstop.\u201d\n\nThe decision was the latest chapter in a case that began last year, when Trump was indicted on four counts arising from Smith\u2019s investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, attacks on the U.S. Capitol. The indictment contended that Trump created \u201cwidespread mistrust \u2026 through pervasive and destabilizing lies about election fraud\u201d and then conspired to undermine \u201ca bedrock function of the United States federal government: the nation\u2019s process of collecting, counting, and certifying the results of the presidential election.\u201d\n\nTrump asked Chutkan to throw out the charges against him, arguing that he is immune from prosecution because he was the president. Chutkan turned that request down in early December, explaining that the presidency does not \u201cconfer a lifelong \u2018get-out-of-jail-free\u2019 pass.\u201d\n\nSmith went to the Supreme Court later that month, asking the justices to weigh in on Trump\u2019s immunity without waiting for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to rule on Trump\u2019s appeal. But the justices declined to do so, and it was six weeks \u2013 Feb. 6, 2024 \u2013 before the court of appeals issued its opinion rejecting Trump\u2019s claim to immunity.\n\nTrump then came to the Supreme Court, seeking review of the D.C. Circuit\u2019s ruling. Two weeks later, the justices agreed to take up his case. They scheduled the argument for late April \u2013 putting the case on a faster track than it normally would have been, but a slower schedule than they had established for another case involving Trump, the challenge to Colorado\u2019s disqualification of the former president from its ballot for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attacks. That case was set for argument just over one month after the court announced that it would review the case in January, and the court issued its decision for Trump just under one month after the oral argument.\n\nIn a ruling on the last day before the Supreme Court\u2019s summer recess, and just over two months after the oral argument, a majority of the court rejected the D.C. Circuit\u2019s reasoning. As an initial matter, Roberts explained in his 43-page ruling, presidents have absolute immunity for their official acts when those acts relate to the core powers granted to them by the Constitution \u2013 for example, the power to issue pardons, veto legislation, recognize ambassadors, and make appointments.\n\nBut when it comes to the president\u2019s other official acts, Roberts continued, there is on one hand the concern that allowing criminal charges against a former president for his official acts would affect his decision-making while in office. \u201cA President inclined to take one course of action based on the public interest may instead opt for another, apprehensive that criminal penalties may befall him upon his departure from office,\u201d Roberts posited. On the other hand, Roberts noted, the public has an interest in \u201cfair and effective\u201d enforcement of criminal laws. Weighing those two sets of interests, Roberts concluded, a president should have immunity from criminal prosecution for his official \u2013 but not his unofficial \u2013 acts unless, at the very least, prosecutors can show that bringing such charges would not threaten the power and functioning of the executive branch.\n\nDetermining which acts are official and which are unofficial \u201ccan be difficult,\u201d Roberts conceded. He emphasized that the immunity that the court recognizes in its ruling on Monday takes a broad view of what constitutes a president\u2019s \u201cofficial responsibilities,\u201d \u201ccovering actions so long as they are not manifestly or palpably beyond his authority.\u201d In conducting the official/unofficial inquiry, Roberts added, courts cannot consider the president\u2019s motives, nor can they designate an act as unofficial simply because it allegedly violates the law.\n\nTurning to some of the specific allegations against Trump, the majority ruled that Trump cannot be prosecuted for his alleged efforts to \u201cleverage the Justice Department\u2019s power and authority to convince certain States to replace their legitimate electors with Trump\u2019s fraudulent slates of electors.\u201d\n\nWith regard to the allegation that Trump attempted to pressure his former vice president, Mike Pence, in his role as president of the senate, to reject the states\u2019 electoral votes or send them back to state legislatures, the court deemed Trump \u201cpresumptively immune\u201d from prosecution on the theory that the president and vice president are acting officially when they discuss their official responsibilities. On the other hand, Roberts observed, the vice president\u2019s role as president of the senate is not an executive branch role. The court therefore left it for the district court to decide whether prosecuting Trump for this conduct would intrude on the power and operation of the executive branch.\n\nThe court did the same for the allegations in the indictment regarding Trump\u2019s interactions with private individuals and state officials, attempting to convince them to change electoral votes in his favor, as well as Trump\u2019s tweets leading up to the Jan. 6 attacks and his speech on the Ellipse that day. Making this determination, Roberts wrote, will require \u201ca close analysis of the indictment\u2019s extensive and interrelated allegations.\u201d\n\nRoberts rejected the government\u2019s contention that, even if Trump has immunity for his official acts, prosecutors can still use evidence about those official acts to make their case to a jury \u2013 for example, to prove that Trump knew that his election-fraud claims were false. \u201cThat proposal,\u201d Roberts stressed, \u201cthreatens to eviscerate the immunity we have recognized. It would permit a prosecutor to do indirectly hat he cannot do directly \u2014 invite the jury to examine acts for which a President is immune from prosecution to nonetheless prove his liability on any charge.\u201d\n\nRoberts pushed back against the dissent by Sotomayor and a separate one by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, describing them as striking \u201ca chilling tone of doom that is wholly disproportionate to what the Court actually does today.\u201d He portrayed the ruling as a relatively narrow one that decides only \u201cthat immunity extends to official discussions between the President and his Attorney General, and then remand to the lower courts\u201d for them to determine whether the other acts alleged in the indictment are entitled to immunity.\n\nRoberts also sought to downplay the political significance of the court\u2019s ruling. He emphasized that although most people are focused on this case because of its potential impact on the charges against Trump, the Supreme Court \u201ccannot afford to fixate exclusively, or even primarily, on present exigencies.\u201d \u201cOur perspective,\u201d he wrote, \u201c must be more farsighted.\u201d\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas agreed with the majority\u2019s immunity ruling but wrote a separate concurring opinion in which he questioned the constitutionality of Jack Smith\u2019s appointment as special counsel. He observed that \u201c[n]o former President has faced criminal prosecution for his acts while in office in the more than 200 years since the founding of our country,\u201d \u201cdespite numerous past Presidents taking actions that many would argue constitute crimes.\u201d \u201cIf this unprecedented prosecution is to proceed,\u201d Thomas contended, \u201cit must be conducted by someone duly authorized to do so by the American people. The lower courts should thus answer these essential questions concerning the Special Counsel\u2019s appointment before proceeding.\u201d\n\nU.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who is overseeing the case brought by Smith in Florida alleging that Trump illegally kept classified documents after leaving office, heard oral arguments on that question last month.\n\nIn her own separate concurrence, Justice Amy Coney Barrett agreed with the majority \u201cthat the Constitution prohibits Congress from criminalizing a President\u2019s exercise\u201d of his core constitutional powers and \u201cclosely related conduct.\u201d But she would have courts approach the question of immunity for other official acts differently, by focusing first on whether the criminal law under which a former president is charged applies to his official acts and, if so, whether prosecuting the former president would interfere with his constitutional authority.\n\nApplying that principle to the facts of this case, she suggested that at least some of the conduct that serves as the basis for the charges against Trump \u2013 such as his request that the speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives hold a special session about election fraud claims \u2013 would not be immune. \u201cThe President,\u201d she concluded, \u201chas no authority over state legislatures or their leadership, so it is hard to see how prosecuting him for crimes committed when dealing with the Arizona House Speaker would unconstitutionally intrude on executive power.\u201d\n\nBarrett also disagreed with her colleagues in the majority on whether prosecutors can use evidence of a president\u2019s official acts. \u201cThe Constitution,\u201d she wrote, \u201cdoes not require blinding juries to the circumstances surrounding conduct for which Presidents can be held liable.\u201d She acknowledged the majority\u2019s concern that the use of such evidence could influence the jury, but she insisted that federal evidentiary rules and the trial courts can address those concerns on a case-by-case basis.\n\nIn her dissent, which (like Jackson\u2019s) notably did not use the traditional \u201crespectfully,\u201d Sotomayor contended that Monday\u2019s ruling \u201creshapes the institution of the Presidency.\u201d \u201cWhether described as presumptive or absolute,\u201d she wrote, \u201cunder the majority\u2019s rule, a President\u2019s use of any official power for any purpose, even the most corrupt, is immune from prosecution. That is just as bad as it sounds, and it is baseless.\u201d \u201cWith fear for our democracy,\u201d she concluded, \u201cI dissent.\u201d\n\nNothing in the text of the Constitution or the history of the United States supports the kind of immunity that the majority found in its opinion, Sotomayor maintained. To the contrary, she noted, the drafters of the Constitution did carve out a narrow immunity for members of Congress, and some state constitutions at the time did explicitly create criminal immunity for governors \u2013 but the drafters did not include any such provision for the president.\n\nIndeed, Sotomayor added, the drafters of the Constitution suggested that the president could face criminal prosecution, by indicating in the provision addressing impeachment that a president can be subject to prosecution even after impeachment.\n\nSotomayor contended that the majority\u2019s decision might sweep more broadly than her colleagues acknowledged. First, she argued that the line that Roberts drew between official and unofficial conduct \u201cnarrows the conduct considered \u2018unofficial\u2019 almost to a nullity. It says that whenever the President acts in a way that is not manifestly or palpably beyond his authority, he is taking official action.\u201d And the majority takes an \u201cexpansive view\u201d of the core powers of the presidency, she continued, that \u201cwill effectively insulate all sorts of noncore conduct from criminal prosecution.\u201d \u201cIn every use of official power,\u201d she concluded, \u201cthe President is now a king above the law.\u201d\n\nIn her own separate dissent, Jackson complained that Monday\u2019s ruling \u201chas unilaterally altered the balance of power between\u201d the three branches of government, giving more power to the courts and the executive branch at Congress\u2019s expense. And it \u201cundermines the constraints of the law as a deterrent for future Presidents who might otherwise abuse their power.\u201d She characterized the \u201cpractical consequences\u201d of the ruling as \u201ca five-alarm fire that threatens to consume democratic self-governance and the normal operations of our Government.\u201d\n\nThis article was originally published at Howe on the Court.",

        "text": "Supreme Court says Trump has absolute immunity for core acts only\nSupreme Court says Trump has absolute immunity for core acts only\n\ntoggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nIn a historic, consequential, and controversial decision on Monday, the Supreme Court granted substantial immunity from prosecution to former president Donald Trump on election subversion charges.\n\nThe decision almost certainly will delay his trial until after the November election, if it takes place at all. The vote was 6-to-3, with the court\u2019s Republican appointees all in the majority, and the Democratic appointees in fierce dissent.\n\nThe decision, written by Chief Justice John Roberts, established a broad new immunity from prosecution, not just for Trump, but for past and future presidents, too. Presidents may not be prosecuted for exercising their \u201ccore\u201d constitutional powers, and even in situations where former presidents might be prosecuted after leaving office, they are entitled to at least presumptive immunity from prosecution for official actions they took as president.\n\nSuch immunity is needed, said the chief justice, in order to protect an \u201cenergetic,\u201d and \u201cindependent executive,\u201d willing to take \u201cbold\u201d actions and make unpopular decisions when needed. And while Roberts said that private actions by a former president are not protected from prosecution, his opinion seemed to inexorably intertwine private and public actions.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe court, however, did not itself resolve whether any of the election subversion charges against Trump could go forward; rather, the justices sent the case back to the trial court judge to determine whether any of the charges against Trump are sufficiently private to survive\u2014in other words, not within his official purview as president. And it made it far more difficult to prosecute a former president by limiting the evidence a prosecutor could present.\n\nIn a brief statement to reporters on Monday, President Biden said that today\u2019s Supreme Court decision undermines the rule of law and sets a \u201cdangerous\u201d precedent.\n\n\u201cToday's decision almost certainly means that there are virtually no limits on what the president can do,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThe power of the office will no longer be constrained by the law, even including the Supreme Court of the United States. The only limits will be self-imposed by the president alone.\u201d\n\nStuart Gerson, a Republican who served in high-level Justice Department positions, put the effect of Monday\u2019s ruling this way: \u201cIt is impossible that this case will be resolved, if ever, before the election.\u201d\n\nIn short, he said, Trump got what he wanted: delay\n\nBut the former president actually got quite a bit more. The court made clear that if he is re-elected, he will be free to simply order the Justice Department to drop the charges against him, and that his pardon power is unlimited.\n\n\u201cMake no mistake,\u201d said Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in a passionate dissent from bench, \u201cthe majority gives President Trump all he asks for and more. \u2026.Whether described as presumptive or absolute, under the majority\u2019s rule, a president\u2019s use of any official power for any purpose, even the most corrupt, is immune from prosecution\u201d under this decision, she said.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nEven the most private and non-official act\u2014like bribery, she said\u2014is insulated because the president is commander in chief, and under the court\u2019s rules laid down Monday, even if bribery charges are brought against a former president, prosecutors could not present evidence of a quid pro quo, she said. The money may have been the quid, but the quo was an official act which presumptively is insulated from prosecution.\n\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett broke from her fellow conservatives on this important point, siding with the dissenters. \u201cThe Constitution,\u201d she said, \u201cdoes not require blinding juries to the circumstances\u201d of a presidents official, and allegedly illegal, action.\n\nMany constitutional scholars had expected a split decision in Monday\u2019s case, but few anticipated such a big win for Trump and for Executive power.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t think anyone imagined that they would draw the line in a way that so clearly put a thumb on the scale for a President and for this particular former president,\u201d said NYU law professor Melissa Murray. For instance, she observed, the court seemed to say that any time the President talked to the Vice President, that conversation was presumptively immune from being disclosed to a jury, regardless of how incriminating it may have been.\n\n\u201cIf I were in the Biden administration,\u201d Murray said, \u201cI would be running on this court\u2019s enormous capacity to stoke chaos.\u201d\n\nGeorgetown University law professor Stephen Vladeck seemed to second that view.\n\n\u201cThe next president probably gets to pick at least two, if not three, justices. Do we want that to be Donald Trump or want that to be Joe Biden? he asked, adding that \u201cthe court did nothing\u2026to make itself less of an issue in the election.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe originalists in the room were actually the liberals,\u201d said Yale law professor Akhil Amar, one of the country\u2019s leading constitutional scholars. He was flabbergasted by the decision, which he maintained is contrary to both the history and the text of the constitution.\n\nAmar said that the court, by barring any consideration of motives in a criminal case against a former president, violated both common sense and the words of the constitution.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t love the criminalization of politics and going after ex-officials, but I think here they really created a Frankenstein, he said. \u201cThere were ways of avoiding that without going nearly so far as they seemed to do.\u201d\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas, speaking for himself alone, took an even more far-reaching position than the court\u2019s other conservatives. He would have held the position of special prosecutor in the Justice Department is unconstitutional.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson joined Justice Sotomayor\u2019s dissent, but wrote separately, accusing the majority of planting \u201cthe seeds of absolute power\u201d for presidents, who until now had been constrained by the law. \u201cIf one man can be allowed to determine for himself what is the law, every man can,\u201d she wrote, in quoting Justice Louis Brandeis, and \u201cit invites anarchy.\u201d\n\nBoth Justices Jackson and Sotomayor did not end their dissents, with the usual, \u201cI respectfully dissent.\u201d Instead, they simply said they dissented.\n\nIn other actions Monday, the court dealt another severe blow to the power of government agencies to regulate. The key question in the case, Corner Post v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, was when exactly the clock starts and stops ticking for challenges to government regulations. By a vote of 6-to-3 along ideological lines, the court ruled against the government, and sided with business interests in elongating the period for challenging a final government regulation.\n\nPreviously, the rule was that the six-year statute of limitations began when the regulation became final. But on Monday, the court said that the an injured plaintiff could file a challenge to a final rule at any time he was injured, as long as it is within six years of the injury, not six years of the rule becoming final.\n\nWriting for the conservative majority, Justice Amy Coney Barret found it troubling that under the government\u2019s contrary view, \u201conly those fortunate enough to suffer an injury within six years of a rule\u2019s promulgation\u201d could sue while \u201c[e]veryone else \u2014 no matter how serious the injury or how illegal the rule \u2014 has no recourse.\u201d\n\nThe upshot of the court\u2019s holding is that that businesses, individuals, and corporate entities can challenge federal regulations long after they were initially promulgated and still be within the statute of limitations. That would appear to put on steroids last week\u2019s decision abolishing so-called Chevron deference, which for 40 years deferred to reasonable agency regulations when a law is ambiguous.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWriting in dissent for the court\u2019s three liberals, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson argued that by further opening the floodgates of litigation, Monday\u2019s ruling will increase the destabilizing effects of the court\u2019s decision last week to overturn the Chevron precedent.\n\n\u201cAt the end of a momentous Term, this much is clear,\u201d Jackson wrote. \u201cThe tsunami of lawsuits against agencies\u201d authorized by last week\u2019s decision and this one have \u201cthe potential to devastate the functioning of the Federal Government.\u201d\n\nAnd in a third major decision, the court declined to issue a final ruling in a set of major cases that challenged whether social media platforms, like newspapers and TV and radio networks, have a First Amendment right to decide what material to put on their platforms.\n\nBy a unanimous vote, the court instead voided two lower court decisions and sent the cases back to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and the Eleventh Circuit for further proceedings commensurate with the high court\u2019s instructions.\n\nWriting for the court, Justice Elena Kagan said that \u201cthere is much work to do below on both these cases\u201d and importantly, at the same time, she signaled that social media companies do have First Amendment rights to moderate content. \u201cThe editorial judgments influencing the content of\u201d Facebook\u2019s NewsFeed and YouTube\u2019s homepage are \u201cprotected expressive activity,\u201d said Kagan. She explicitly added that 5th Circuit\u2019s ruling, which upheld a ban on content moderation in Texas, \u201cwas wrong.\u201d Texas, she said, \u201cmay not interfere with those judgments simply because it would prefer a mix of messages.\u201d\n\nJordan Thomas contributed to this report",

        "text": "Trump NY sentencing delayed after U.S. Supreme Court presidential immunity ruling \u2022 Missouri Independent\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A New York judge agreed Tuesday to delay the criminal sentencing of former President Donald Trump in the state hush money case after Trump claimed the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s presidential immunity decision absolves him.\n\nNew York Justice Juan Merchan, who oversaw the case, ordered the delay until Sept. 18 so the court could hear arguments on how the Supreme Court\u2019s immunity decision on Monday impacts Trump\u2019s state-level convictions, according to court filings.\n\nTrump claims his 34 New York felony guilty verdicts violate Monday\u2019s high court ruling and should be thrown out, according to a letter to Merchan from Trump attorney Todd Blanche.\n\n\u201cThe verdicts in this case violate the presidential immunity doctrine and create grave risks of \u2018an Executive Branch that cannibalizes itself,\u2019\u201d Blanche wrote, adding that after further review, \u201cit will be manifest that the trial result cannot stand.\u201d\n\nA Manhattan jury on May 30 found the former president guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment made to a porn star in the weeks prior to the 2016 presidential election.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg agreed in a letter to Merchan to a two-week delay in Trump\u2019s sentencing, according to the court filings.\n\nTrump\u2019s team has until July 10 to file its argument. Bragg agreed to a July 24 deadline for his reply.\n\n\u201cAlthough we believe (the) defendant\u2019s arguments to be without merit, we do not oppose his request for leave to file and his putative request to adjourn sentencing pending determination of his motion,\u201d Bragg wrote Tuesday.\n\nMerchan scheduled the sentencing for July 11, just days before Trump is scheduled to be officially nominated as his party\u2019s 2024 presidential candidate at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. The new date pushes the sentencing less than two months before Election Day.\n\nPresidential immunity opinion\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in a 6-3 decision that former U.S. presidents enjoy absolute criminal immunity for \u201ccore Constitutional\u201d powers and are \u201centitled to at least presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official acts,\u201d but are not immune from criminal prosecution for \u201cunofficial acts.\u201d\n\nTrump escalated the question of presidential immunity to the Supreme Court after two lower courts denied his requests for immunity from federal criminal charges alleging he attempted to overturn the 2020 presidential election results during his last months in the Oval Office.\n\nThe justices\u2019 majority opinion ordered the 2020 election interference case back to the lower district court to decide whether Trump\u2019s actions were official or unofficial acts. Those actions include Trump\u2019s conversations with state officials about overturning election results and his social media posts claiming election fraud.\n\nNY verdict\n\nBlanche asked Merchan to \u201cset aside\u201d Trump\u2019s guilty verdict based on Monday\u2019s Supreme Court ruling in Trump v. United States, according to the July 1 letter.\n\nBlanche claimed that evidence presented by the prosecution against Trump during the New York case were likely \u201cofficial acts.\u201d\n\nThe New York state case centered on actions Trump took during his first year in office, including an Oval Office meeting to discuss financial transactions with his former personal attorney and checks that he personally signed.\n\n\u201cUnder (Trump v. U.S.), this official-acts evidence should never have been put before the jury,\u201d Blanche wrote.\n\n\u201cMoreover, as we argued previously, (Trump v. U.S.) forbids the \u2018[u]se of evidence about such [official] conduct, even when an indictment alleges only unofficial conduct.\u2019 This includes President Trump\u2019s \u2018Tweets\u2019 and \u2018public address[es],\u2019\u201d Blanche wrote, quoting directly from the Supreme Court opinion.\n\nNew York prosecutors presented mounds of evidence, including business records and witness testimony, during the seven-week trial illustrating that Trump repaid his former lawyer Michael Cohen for giving $130,000 to porn star Stormy Daniels prior to the 2016 election. Trump later recorded the payments as \u201clegal expenses\u201d and increased the amount to Cohen to account for taxes and a bonus.\n\nTestimony also revealed an Oval Office meeting Trump held with Cohen to discuss the repayment scheme, and evidence included nine checks bearing Trump\u2019s personal signature.",

        "text": "Joe Biden vs Donald Trump: Important Dates In 2024 US Presidential Race\nPresident Joe Biden, a Democrat, and Republican former President Donald Trump will face each other in the 2024 presidential election in what is expected to be a divisive and closely fought contest.\n\n2024\n\n- July 11: Trump, the first sitting or former U.S. president to be convicted of a crime, will be sentenced in the Manhattan hush money case where he was found guilty of falsifying documents to cover up a payment to silence a porn star. He denies wrongdoing and plans to appeal.\n\n- July 15-18: Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where the party formally chooses its candidate.\n\n- In late July or beyond: Vice President Kamala Harris has agreed to debate Trump's yet-to-be-announced running mate on CBS on either of the proposed dates of July 23 or Aug. 13. Trump has accepted a vice presidential debate to be held by Fox News.\n\nFox wrote to both campaigns suggesting July 23, Aug. 13 or other dates following the party conventions. Trump's campaign has yet to say whether his running mate would debate Harris on CBS. Nor has the Biden campaign said if Harris would debate on Fox.\n\n- By Aug. 7: The Democrats are set to hold a \"virtual roll call\" to nominate Biden. It will take place by Aug. 7, the original ballot certification deadline in Ohio, although that date has since been pushed back.\n\nBiden had been due to be officially nominated at the Democratic National Convention later in August.\n\n- Aug. 19-22: Democratic National Convention in Chicago.\n\n- Sept. 10: The second debate between Biden and Trump will be hosted by ABC.\n\n- Nov 5: Election Day\n\n- Later in November: It could take days for the election result to be known, especially if it is close and mail-in ballots are a factor.\n\n2025\n\n- Jan. 6: The vice president presides over the Electoral College vote count at a joint session of Congress, announces the results and declares who has been elected. Ahead of the count on Jan. 6, 2021, then-President Trump lambasted his vice president, Mike Pence, for refusing to try to prevent Congress from certifying Biden's win. On that day, the U.S. Capitol was attacked by rioters, and some people chanted, \"hang Mike Pence\" as they tried to stop the count. Both chambers of Congress later resumed their work and certified Biden's win.\n\nCongress has since passed the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act of 2022, which requires approval of one-fifth of the House and Senate to consider a challenge to a state's results - a much higher bar than existed before when any single lawmaker from each chamber could trigger a challenge.\n\n- Jan. 20: The inauguration of the election winner and their vice president takes place. At this ceremony, the victor and vice president are officially sworn into office.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Americans are split over the state of the American dream\n\u201cThe American dream\u201d is a century-old phrase used to describe the idea that anyone can achieve success in the United States through hard work and determination. Today, about half of Americans (53%) say that dream is still possible.\n\nHow we did this Pew Research Center asked Americans about their views of the American dream as part of a larger survey exploring their social and political attitudes. We surveyed 8,709 U.S. adults from April 8 to 14, 2024. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology. Here are the questions used for this analysis, along with responses, and its methodology.\n\nAnother 41% say the American dream was once possible for people to achieve \u2013 but is not anymore. And 6% say it was never possible, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey of 8,709 U.S. adults.\n\nWhile this is the first time the Center has asked about the American dream in this way, other surveys have long found that sizable shares of Americans are skeptical about the future of the American dream.\n\nWho believes the American dream is still possible?\n\nThere are relatively modest differences in views of the American dream by race and ethnicity, partisanship, and education. But there are wider divides by age and income.\n\nAge\n\nAmericans ages 50 and older are more likely than younger adults to say the American dream is still possible. About two-thirds of adults ages 65 and older (68%) say this, as do 61% of those 50 to 64.\n\nBy comparison, only about four-in-ten adults under 50 (42%) say it\u2019s still possible for people to achieve the American dream.\n\nIncome\n\nHigher-income Americans are also more likely than others to say the American dream is still achievable.\n\nWhile 64% of upper-income Americans say the American dream still exists, 39% of lower-income Americans say the same \u2013 a gap of 25 percentage points.\n\nMiddle-income Americans fall in between, with a 56% majority saying the American dream is still possible.\n\nRace and ethnicity\n\nRoughly half of Americans in each racial and ethnic group say the American dream remains possible. And while relatively few Americans \u2013 just 6% overall \u2013 say that the American dream was never possible, Black Americans are about twice as likely as those in other groups to say this (11%).\n\nPartisanship\n\nWhile 56% of Republicans and Republican leaners say the American dream is still possible to achieve, 50% of Democrats and Democratic leaners say the same.\n\nEducation\n\nA 57% majority of adults with a bachelor\u2019s degree or more education say the American dream remains possible, compared with 50% of those with less education.\n\nAge and income differences within both parties\n\nAge and income differences in views of the American dream persist within each political party.\n\nAge\n\nClear majorities of both Republicans (64%) and Democrats (67%) ages 50 and older say achieving the American dream is still possible.\n\nIn contrast, just 38% of Democrats under 50 and 48% of Republicans under 50 view the American dream as still possible.\n\nIncome\n\nIn both parties, upper-income Americans are about 25 points more likely than lower-income Americans to say it is still possible for people to achieve the American dream.\n\nDo people think they can achieve the American dream?\n\nAmericans are also divided over whether they think they personally can achieve the American dream. About three-in-ten (31%) say they\u2019ve achieved it, while a slightly larger share (36%) say they are on their way to achieving it. Another 30% say it\u2019s out of reach for them. These views are nearly identical to when the Center last asked this question in 2022.\n\nRace and ethnicity\n\nWhite adults (39%) are more likely than Black (15%) and Hispanic adults (19%), and about as likely as Asian adults (34%), to say they have already achieved the American dream.\n\nBlack (48%), Hispanic (47%) and Asian adults (46%) are more likely than White adults (29%) to say they are on their way to achieving it.\n\nParty\n\nRepublicans are more likely than Democrats to say they have achieved the American dream (38% vs. 28%). But Democrats are somewhat more likely than Republicans to say they\u2019re on the way to achieving it (38% vs. 34%). Democrats are also more likely than Republicans to view the American dream as personally out of reach.\n\nIncome and age\n\nOlder and higher-income Americans are more likely than younger and less wealthy Americans to say they have achieved or are within reach of the American dream. These patterns are similar to those for views about the American dream more generally.\n\nNote: Here are the questions used for this analysis, along with responses, and its methodology.",

It found that, for about 42 per cent of respondents, the political leadership in the US didn\u2019t make a difference to their desire to study. And 30 per cent expressed being more likely to choose to study in the US under a Trump presidency.\n\nThese results contrast with the 2016/17 Know Your Neighborhood report, when Donald Trump ran for, and won the US presidential election. At this time, 54 per cent of respondents were less likely to pursue studies in the US due to concerns about Trump\u2019s leadership and 32 per cent of respondents were indifferent. The 2024 report points out, though, that the declines in international students who went to the US after Trump\u2019s election was not nearly at the level expressed in the survey results.\n\nThe 2024 report also found that concerns about religious/racial discrimination, personal safety, and political instability had no influence on the desire to study abroad for 44 per cent of respondents.\n\nThe survey was conducted between 11 March and 19 April 2024 with almost 2500 respondents completing the survey.\n\nYou can download a copy of the Know Your Neighborhood 2024 Survey Summary Report here.",

        "text": "Trump NY sentencing delayed after U.S. Supreme Court presidential immunity ruling \u2022 Oregon Capital Chronicle\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A New York judge agreed Tuesday to delay the criminal sentencing of former President Donald Trump in the state hush money case after Trump claimed the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s presidential immunity decision absolves him.\n\nNew York Justice Juan Merchan, who oversaw the case, ordered the delay until Sept. 18 so the court could hear arguments on how the Supreme Court\u2019s immunity decision on Monday impacts Trump\u2019s state-level convictions, according to court filings.\n\nTrump claims his 34 New York felony guilty verdicts violate Monday\u2019s high court ruling and should be thrown out, according to a letter to Merchan from Trump attorney Todd Blanche.\n\n\u201cThe verdicts in this case violate the presidential immunity doctrine and create grave risks of \u2018an Executive Branch that cannibalizes itself,\u2019\u201d Blanche wrote, adding that after further review, \u201cit will be manifest that the trial result cannot stand.\u201d\n\nA Manhattan jury on May 30 found the former president guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment made to a porn star in the weeks prior to the 2016 presidential election.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg agreed in a letter to Merchan to a two-week delay in Trump\u2019s sentencing, according to the court filings.\n\nTrump\u2019s team has until July 10 to file its argument. Bragg agreed to a July 24 deadline for his reply.\n\n\u201cAlthough we believe (the) defendant\u2019s arguments to be without merit, we do not oppose his request for leave to file and his putative request to adjourn sentencing pending determination of his motion,\u201d Bragg wrote Tuesday.\n\nMerchan scheduled the sentencing for July 11, just days before Trump is scheduled to be officially nominated as his party\u2019s 2024 presidential candidate at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. The new date pushes the sentencing less than two months before Election Day.\n\nPresidential immunity opinion\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in a 6-3 decision that former U.S. presidents enjoy absolute criminal immunity for \u201ccore Constitutional\u201d powers and are \u201centitled to at least presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official acts,\u201d but are not immune from criminal prosecution for \u201cunofficial acts.\u201d\n\nTrump escalated the question of presidential immunity to the Supreme Court after two lower courts denied his requests for immunity from federal criminal charges alleging he attempted to overturn the 2020 presidential election results during his last months in the Oval Office.\n\nThe justices\u2019 majority opinion ordered the 2020 election interference case back to the lower district court to decide whether Trump\u2019s actions were official or unofficial acts. Those actions include Trump\u2019s conversations with state officials about overturning election results and his social media posts claiming election fraud.\n\nNY verdict\n\nBlanche asked Merchan to \u201cset aside\u201d Trump\u2019s guilty verdict based on Monday\u2019s Supreme Court ruling in Trump v. United States, according to the July 1 letter.\n\nBlanche claimed that evidence presented by the prosecution against Trump during the New York case were likely \u201cofficial acts.\u201d\n\nThe New York state case centered on actions Trump took during his first year in office, including an Oval Office meeting to discuss financial transactions with his former personal attorney and checks that he personally signed.\n\n\u201cUnder (Trump v. U.S.), this official-acts evidence should never have been put before the jury,\u201d Blanche wrote.\n\n\u201cMoreover, as we argued previously, (Trump v. U.S.) forbids the \u2018[u]se of evidence about such [official] conduct, even when an indictment alleges only unofficial conduct.\u2019 This includes President Trump\u2019s \u2018Tweets\u2019 and \u2018public address[es],\u2019\u201d Blanche wrote, quoting directly from the Supreme Court opinion.\n\nNew York prosecutors presented mounds of evidence, including business records and witness testimony, during the seven-week trial illustrating that Trump repaid his former lawyer Michael Cohen for giving $130,000 to porn star Stormy Daniels prior to the 2016 election. Trump later recorded the payments as \u201clegal expenses\u201d and increased the amount to Cohen to account for taxes and a bonus.\n\nTestimony also revealed an Oval Office meeting Trump held with Cohen to discuss the repayment scheme, and evidence included nine checks bearing Trump\u2019s personal signature.",

        "text": "Three Ways Statistics Impact Elections\nThree Ways Statistics Impact Elections\n\n125: that is the number of days until US Election Day, 2024. On November 5, the 47th president of the United States will be decided. So while campaigns are in full swing, and pollsters are making predictions, this blog focuses on the role of statistics in the election process.\n\nAt their most basic, elections allow citizens to exercise representative democracy by selecting individuals to occupy public office. Those selected then make critical decisions that impact citizens. And these ballots that officials tally are then transformed into statistical data, ultimately determining the election\u2019s result.\n\nHowever, statistics play a part in the election process long before voters cast their ballots. That is, officials use statistics to forecast election results, inform campaign strategy, and micro-target individuals.\n\nAn understanding of how statistics are used in elections, then, can enhance transparency for voters, as well as encourage all citizens to advocate for data privacy and security. Additionally, those interested in mathematics, statistical applications, and political science might be interested in learning about how statistics impact elections.\n\nStatistics in Politics\n\nThroughout history, statistics have played an important role in politics. Government bodies used statistics in the election process to support the formal decision-making processes that determine who will fill offices in the legislature. However, technological advancements, the accumulation of data, and the maturation of statistical models have made elections increasingly complex.\n\nFor example, in the past, politicians and their supporters would cast a wider net when campaigning for votes. But today, data analytics and digital resources allow parties to collect information about the public and then hyper-personalize campaign targeting. As a result, modern elections require statistical experts who can manage and leverage data while maintaining ethical standards related to trust, security, and privacy.\n\nBelow are the most obvious three ways that statistics impact elections.\n\nElection Forecasts\n\nThose creating election forecasts use legally available data and statistics to inform the public about the probable outcome of an upcoming election. Political statisticians recruit this data, along with reporting, historical patterns, and academic research to create a detailed account of the Senate and House forecasts.\n\nIn the United States, this process includes disclosing the favored party, estimating the number of seats in each House, and predicting whether the outcome will result in a majority government. In short, statisticians use a forecasting model to transform large data sets into meaningful predictions for future outcomes\n\n\n\nHow to Build an Election Forecast Model\n\nCreate a national database.\n\nClean and layer the data.\n\nPlug the data points into a predictive model for forecasting.\n\nForecasting in Action\n\nThe homepage of FiveThirtyEight on June 26, 2024 The popular website FiveThirtyEight, created by American statistician Nate Silver, is a staple of ABC News. The website\u2019s primary objectives are advancing public knowledge and promoting transparency around voting outcomes. To achieve these aims, it uses polling, economic, and demographic data to explore likely election outcomes. It also employs statisticians to build empirical statistical models for accurate election forecasts.\n\nAfter the data is collected, experts then input it into Nate Silver\u2019s forecast model. This model, which combines polling, economic, and demographic data, aims to provide an informed prediction rather than an unskilled guess.\n\nAnd the website regularly updates its predictions too. For instance, on June 26, 2024, the site, after running 100 simulations, predicted that President Joe Biden and Donald Trump each had a 50% chance of winning the election. However, on July 2, 538 changed the prediction to 50% for Trump and 49% for Biden. And as the election nears, and uncertainty decreases, 538 claims its predictions will grow more accurate. This site exemplifies just one popular election forecast tool.\n\nElection Campaign Strategy\n\nThe use of statistics in election campaigning has also changed dramatically. That is, historically, the only data that politicians and their supporters used to garner insights was that derived from the polls. In recent years, however, data and statistics have revolutionized election campaigns.\n\nToday\u2019s data-driven world offers campaign strategists a surplus of data points about past elections, voter preferences, and geopolitical influences. In addition, new communication platforms, such as social media, allow campaigns to profile their voters\u2019 identities and needs. Statisticians can also harness publicly available data to inform campaign messaging, political priorities, and outreach.\n\nCampaign research allows parties to investigate target audiences\u2019 behaviors, attitudes, values, and beliefs to test campaign messaging, creativity, and delivery. According to The Commons Social Change Library, statisticians use the following quantitative and qualitative research methods to inform campaign strategy.\n\nQuantitative Campaign Strategy Research Benchmark Polls\n\nIssue Polls\n\nLongitudinal Surveys\n\nMember Surveys\n\nCATI (computer-assisted telephone interview) polls\n\nDial-testing Qualitative Campaign Strategy Research Deep dive interviews\n\nFace-to-face focus groups\n\nOnline focus groups\n\nOnline communities\n\nOnce the previous research is complete, campaigners then test various messages. Alternatively, they might test the gap between their voters\u2019 current stances and the desirable action. This job is a laborious one. Campaigners must strive for creating winning messages that make impactful arguments, define important issues, expose the opposition\u2019s weak points, and tell compelling narratives.\n\nStatisticians with a marketing background may excel in this area of research and persuasion. Why? They already have the foundational skills needed to create data-driven campaign strategies, from initial research to distribution.\n\n\n\nMicrotargeting in Elections\n\nBefore advanced data and statistics, campaigns often involved grass-roots approaches. These included direct mail, home visits, radio, television, and out-of-home marketing campaigns (ex., billboards, posters, etc.). Today, campaigns can leverage social media, digital marketing, and advanced data analytics to reach voters on their devices and tailor personalized messaging. This latter strategy is otherwise known as microtargeting.\n\nSocial media apps collect information on users to create personalized messages. In microtargeting, the audience is segmented into specific groups, with each group receiving a message that speaks to their likes and needs. This profiling, though, is not new. Consumers are already accustomed to online stores such as Amazon, as well as social media (TikTok, Facebook) understanding their preferences. For instance, you purchase one book and Amazon recommends a similar one. You buy running shoes (a lot) and you\u2019re now in a fitness/running channel.\n\nSimilarly, political parties and election campaigns use microtargeting to communicate with voters about their initiatives. The goal is influencing voting outcomes in their favor.\n\nHow Microtargeting Works\n\nMicro-targeting uses statistics in a similar manner to that of election forecasting. First, statisticians collect and clean data points from a national database. Then, they layer on publicly available information, including email addresses, phone numbers, employment, education, purchasing patterns, IP addresses, etc.\n\nNext, statisticians use predictive models to indicate for whom a voter is likely to vote and how likely a voter is to change their voting preference. These models also predict how lifestyle choices, such as being single or married, might affect voting behaviors. Statisticians also investigate how voters\u2019 values align with topical issues like gun control, the climate crisis, abortion, immigration, and so on.\n\nAfter the analysis comes the categorization. Each group is sorted into different channels. Each audience (channel) then receives personalized campaign messaging based on their beliefs and inclinations. The purpose is delivering the right campaign message, to the right voter, at the right time. (At its roots, microtargeting is a very deliberate form of kairos. In rhetoric, kairos is the identification of the critical moment to deliver a finely tuned persuasive message or to take an action.)\n\nThe Risks of Microtargeting\n\nAdvanced microtargeting, of course, has its downsides. Take the most famous example, which began in 2014. Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm, obtained the private Facebook data of tens of millions of users. It then unethically sold psychological profiles of American voters to political campaigns.\n\nHow did this microtargeting scam work? 270,000 Facebook users played with the supposedly innocuous personality profile app called \u201cThis Is Your Digital Life.\u201d This app, created by scientist and psychologist Alexsandr Kogan, allegedly collected 5,000 data points from each participant.\n\nWhat\u2019s worse: participants didn\u2019t read between the lines. When users gave this third-party app permission to acquire their data, they also gave the app access to their friends\u2019 networks. The more friends = the more data exposed.\n\nKogan then sold this data to Cambridge Analytica. As a result, the company illegally compiled the data of about 87 million users who had not explicitly given Cambridge Analytica permission. The firm then used up to 50 million profiles for their predictive modeling. At the very least, the app developer breached Facebook\u2019s terms of service by giving the data to Cambridge Analytica. After investigations began, the incident started a heated, nationwide conversation about the ethical principles of data, political targeting, and power. And about Facebook, data security, and cybersecurity.\n\nStudy Applied Statistics at Michigan Tech.\n\nElection campaigning and increased microtargeting are very much still with us. Therefore, firms that generate value from personal data must consider the ways they acquire it, share it, protect it, and profit from it. Statisticians who work for these firms must also stay in line with ongoing legislative efforts that respect users\u2019 privacy and security.\n\nCurious about how statistics make a difference in elections? Are you fascinated by the data-driven side of political science? Do you want to ensure statistics are collected ethically?

        "text": "US election: Joe Biden's family urge president to stay in White House race as donors discuss alternative scenarios in Trump battle\nJoe Biden's family has urged the US president not to quit the election campaign, even as donors discussed the alternatives if he pulled out following his disastrous performance in last week's first presidential debate with Donald Trump.\n\nMr Biden's family discussed the future of his campaign when they met for a long-planned photo shoot at Camp David in Maryland on Sunday, and told him he should \"keep fighting\", NBC, Sky News' US partner said, quoting two sources familiar with the discussions.\n\nHis wife Jill Biden and Mr Biden's son, Hunter, the people whose opinions he values most, both insisted he should stay in the race as he's the best-placed candidate to defeat Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:44 'Biden, you are fired'\n\nIt was a view echoed by the rest of the family, who instead blamed the president's advisers for failing to prepare him properly.\n\nAround 40 of Biden's top financial backers were briefed by campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez, who told them most of the campaign's significant war chest would fall to Vice President Kamala Harris, with a smaller pool of money kept by the Democratic National Committee (DNC).\n\nIt was one of several meetings in recent days in which campaign managers have tried to shore up support for Mr Biden, whom, they insist, can still win November's election.\n\nBut a Biden victory appeared a long way away as the 81-year-old Democrat candidate paused and stumbled his way through a gruelling TV debate on Thursday in Atlanta, his performance dismissed as an \"unmitigated disaster\" by some in his own party.\n\nA poll of polls maintained by analysts FiveThirtyEight had the pair roughly neck and neck until the debate, but Donald Trump has since pulled ahead, if only by one percentage point. RealClearPolitics put Trump 1.9 percentage points in front.\n\nWatched by an estimated 51 million people, Mr Biden, whose age was already seen as a liability by voters, sounded raspy, trailed off, and at times gave convoluted answers during the debate.\n\nThe president's showing sparked alarm among supporters, donors and campaign surrogates, worried that Mr Biden's age, already targeted by Trump, 78, had caught up with him, and this was one campaign too far.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:32 Vice President: Biden had 'slow start'\n\nMr Biden's campaign has been working hard to persuade them that is not the case ever since.\n\nProminent Democrats made a public show of support for him on Sunday, among them congressman James Clyburn of South Carolina, who said: \"I do not believe that Joe Biden has a problem leading for the next four years.\"\n\nRead more from Sky News:\n\nNew York Times tells Biden to quit\n\nJoe Biden: Could the Democrats replace him?\n\nWho is Gavin Newsom?

        "text": "Joe Biden to withdraw from 2024 Presidential race amid criticism over debate fiasco? How Democratic allies voted\nWhile President Joe Biden was away at Camp David for a long-planned family gathering, key US Democratic leaders firmly supported him, rejecting calls for him to end his 2024 re-election campaign despite his faltering debate performance last week against former President Donald Trump, Voice of America (VOA) reported.\n\nBiden's Democratic supporters acknowledged the 81-year-old president's shortcomings during the nationally televised 90-minute debate. Biden struggled to complete sentences and mistakenly claimed to have ended Medicare, the government's health insurance program for older Americans in the debate.\n\nAlso Read | On this day: Key events on July 1\n\nA recent CBS-YouGov poll revealed that 72% of Americans believe Biden lacks the \"mental and cognitive health to serve as president,\" a seven-point decline from three weeks ago. However, national polling still shows a tight race between Biden and Trump.\n\nProminent Democratic officials dismissed suggestions from some party members and editorials in The New York Times and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that Biden should step aside for a younger candidate. \"The unfortunate truth is that Biden should withdraw from the race, for the good of the nation he has served so admirably for half a century,\" The Atlanta Journal-Constitution stated.\n\nGeorgia Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock countered on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" saying, \"Bad debates happen. The question is, 'Who has Donald Trump ever shown up for other than himself and people like himself?' I'm with Joe Biden, and it's our assignment to make sure that he gets over the finish line come November.\"\n\nRepresentative Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, a prominent Biden supporter, told CNN's \"State of the Union,\" \"I do not believe that Joe Biden has a problem leading for the next four years because he's done a great job of leading for the last three-and-a-half years. I always say that the best predictor of future behavior is past performance.\" He attributed Biden's debate performance to \"preparation overload.\"\n\nMaryland Governor Wes Moore commented on CBS's \"Face the Nation\" that \"the president had a difficult night just like every single one of us do\" but argued it should not force him out of the race. \"Joe Biden is not going to take himself out of this race, nor should he,\" he asserted.\n\nBiden's campaign echoed this sentiment in a fundraising appeal, warning that replacing him would lead to chaos before the August national party convention and jeopardize the election. Kate Bedingfield, a former Biden White House communications aide, told CNN that the campaign had raised $33 million since the debate.\n\nHowever, some Republicans saw Biden's continued candidacy as problematic. Reince Priebus, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, described Biden staying in the race as \"just all downside for Joe Biden,\" calling his debate performance \"an incoherent, almost impossible mess.\" Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, stated, \"He's a decent man. He's a failed president. He is compromised. That's the storyline here.\"\n\nAlso Read | Cement: Too early for the consolidation party",

        "text": "\u2018Dangerous precedent\u2019: Biden denounces court ruling on Trump immunity\nUS president warns Supreme Court\u2019s decision meant there were virtually no limits on what a president could do in office.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has denounced the United States Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity as a \u201cdangerous precedent\u201d that undermined the rule of law and called on the American people to \u201cdissent\u201d by rejecting Republican candidate Donald Trump in November\u2019s election.\n\nBiden issued the statement shortly after the highest US court ruled that Trump could not be prosecuted for any actions that were within his constitutional powers as president but could be for private acts. The decision is seen as a landmark ruling recognising for the first time any form of presidential immunity from prosecution.\n\nIn an address from the White House on Monday, Biden said the court decision meant Trump, his predecessor and challenger, was highly unlikely to go on trial before the November 5 presidential election for his role in seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 election that Biden won.\n\n\u201cThis nation was founded on the principle that there are no kings in America. Each, each of us is equal before the law. No one, no one is above the law. Not even the president of the United States,\u201d Biden said.\n\nHe said the court\u2019s decision meant there were now virtually no limits on what a president could do.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous precedent, because the power of the office will no longer be constrained by the law,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThe only limits will be self-imposed by the president alone.\u201d\n\n\u2018I dissent\u2019\n\nBiden said he sided with liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who wrote she feared for US democracy in her dissent in the 6-3 ruling by the conservative-leaning court. Three members of the court are Trump appointees.\n\n\u201cNow the American people will have to do what the court should have been willing to do, but will not. The American people will render judgement on Donald Trump\u2019s tenure,\u201d Biden said.\n\n\u201cI concur with Justice Sotomayor\u2019s dissent today,\u201d he added. \u201cSo should the American people dissent. I dissent. May God bless you all. May God help preserve our democracy,\u201d Biden said in closing.\n\nAsked on Fox News about Biden\u2019s remarks, House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, called them \u201cdespicable\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d and accused the president of \u201ctrying to undermine the Supreme Court\u201d.\n\nBiden is running for re-election against Trump, a rematch of the 2020 vote, and has been sharply critical of his rival\u2019s actions related to the January 6, 2021 raid on the US Capitol by Trump\u2019s supporters who believed his false claims that he had won the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cNow the man who sent that mob to the US Capitol is facing potential criminal conviction for what happened that day,\u201d Biden said. \u201cNow, because of today\u2019s decision, that is highly, highly unlikely. It\u2019s a terrible disservice to the people in this nation.\u201d\n\nDuring his brief remarks, the president did not take questions or mention the debate with Trump, his shaky performance triggering anxiety in the Democratic Party.",

        "text": "Pennsylvania election official on the greatest threat in the 2024 presidential election\nIn 2020, the crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania faced significant turmoil with election protests, court challenges and threats against election officials, including Republican Al Schmidt.\n\nSchmidt, who previously oversaw Philadelphia's elections as a commissioner and supervised the city's election, now holds the position of secretary of the commonwealth, the state's top election official.\n\nHe said the greatest threat to the 2024 presidential election is the high turnover rate among those officials who are responsible for running elections.\n\n\"Some people left because of the ugly environment with threats. Some people left because it was time for them to retire,\" said Schmidt.\n\nMore than 80 senior election officials across two-thirds of Pennsylvania's 67 counties have departed. When long-time election workers are replaced by less experienced individuals, the likelihood of errors in election administration increases, according to Schmidt.\n\nAn analysis of last year's general election in Pennsylvania found that ballot errors doubled in the state's municipal general elections from 2021 to 2023. These errors included incorrect instructions to voters on the number of candidates to vote for; duplicate ballots being sent to the same voter; races or candidates being left off the ballot; improper ballot instructions; and spelling mistakes.\n\n\"When you are running elections, there is no room for error, right? There's no redos or do-overs,\" said Schmidt, adding that remedial actions were put in place to ensure the accuracy of the results despite the mistakes.\n\nChris Spackman, the new director of elections for Dauphin County, will oversee his first presidential election this year. Spackman, who previously served as deputy director, feels well-supported in his new role, receiving guidance from fellow election directors and his predecessor.\n\nBut not all counties have the same level of support. In some counties in Pennsylvania and across the country, a single person is responsible for managing the entire election process. Ensuring the integrity of the vote in these cases often requires reliance on other departments or offices within the county.\n\n\"But in our experience, you have checks and balances built into this system to make sure election results are accurate and people can have confidence in those results,\" said Schmidt.\n\nA CBS News poll revealed that 72% of Pennsylvania Republicans do not consider President Biden the legitimate winner of the 2020 presidential election. Schmidt encouraged those with doubts to get more involved in the election process.\n\n\"When I meet people who are responsible for running elections, I don't know if they're Democrats, I don't know if they're Republicans, and I don't really care if they are or not. I care that they're running elections in a way that's free and fair and safe and secure,\" said Schmidt.\n\nLooking ahead to Nov. 6, the day after Election Day, Schmidt said he has one clear hope: that news agencies report, \"Election Day went smoothly in Pennsylvania.\"",

        "text": "Health care costs are a top concern for voters in the 2024 election\nAlthough overshadowed in the national political discourse by discussions about the importance of the economy, immigration, or abortion, voters have expressed that health care continues to be one of their highest priorities. In fact, a May 2024 poll by Pew found that health care was the third-highest issue priority for voters, garnering a robust 57% from respondents.\n\nThe salience of health care bodes well for Biden since he outperforms Trump on health care (39% trust Biden on health care, compared to 34% who prefer Trump), as seen from an ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted last month, consistent with most polls that show a similar modest advantage for Biden on the matter.\n\nThe importance of health care to voters is magnified when we consider that it is one of the factors compounding the economic stress Americans are facing, resulting in inflation and the rising cost of living outpacing all other issues in poll\n\nMost voters include the rising health care costs they are experiencing among other critical purchases they have to make. For example, a recent KFF tracking poll shows that health care tops the list of basic expenses Americans worry about\u2014even more than gas, food, and rent. In fact, nearly three in four adults in that KFF poll underscore that they\u2019re concerned about paying for unexpected medical bills and other health costs.\n\nHealth care and Latino voters\n\nHealth care resonates as a policy issue to many sub-groups of the larger electorate, including Latino voters who continue to trail other racial and ethnic groups in access to health insurance and medical care. A recent UnidosUS poll found health care to be third among policy priorities for registered Latino voters, behind only the rising cost of living and jobs/the economy.\n\nWhen Latino voters are asked to provide clarity on what they mean when they identify health care as a top priority, the cost of health care (premiums, deductibles, etc.) is the most commonly cited definition, followed by prescription costs, and then quality of care.\n\nAlthough discussions regarding Latino voting behavior focus largely on the potential shift of Latinos toward Trump and the Republican Party, interestingly, health care tends to be a particularly relevant policy issue among Latinos who are moving to the left in their partisan preferences. UnidosUS finds that a sizable 38% of Latino self-identified Republicans reporting greater openness to Democrats in 2024 identify health care as a top issue of concern, with premiums and prescription drug costs most often identified as the root of these Republicans\u2019 concerns.\n\nSharp differences in policy priorities for voters to consider\n\nWhile its name doesn\u2019t suggest landmark health policy, the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, included a provision allowing Medicare to negotiate prices for some of the most expensive drugs. The IRA also capped the total out-of-pocket spending for prescription drugs for all Medicare patients, dropping from roughly $3,500 to $2,000, while capping the price of insulin for those with diabetes at $35 a month. These are policy actions that can directly address the concerns of voters. The challenge for Biden continues to be connecting his policy advancements with voters and more effectively communicating these important reductions to health care costs.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act will continue to be a factor for voters some 14 years after it was passed by former President Obama. The popularity of the ACA makes this a dangerous environment for Republicans, as former President Trump has suggested he would repeal the law if elected. The KFF poll found that more adults want to see the program expanded rather than scaled back, and there has been a recent surge in insurance enrollments, with a record 21.3 million people signed up for coverage already in 2024\u2014a quarter of those being new consumers of health insurance. Compounding the political pressure for Republicans in 2024, this increase in enrollments has been higher in red states, with annual increases of 80% in West Virginia, 75% in Louisiana, and 62% in Ohio, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\n\nAlthough former President Trump has said he wouldn\u2019t cut Medicare spending, Democrats will likely seek to associate him with other Republicans who support constraining the program\u2019s costs. However, raising taxes on people making more than $400,000 a year to shore up Medicare\u2019s finances is one idea that received strong backing in a recent poll by the Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\nAs November 2024 approaches, other issues will likely continue to capture national headlines. Health care, however, just might be the issue that ultimately decides the election outcome. The candidate who can persuade the American public that they have the best plan to reduce the costs of health care expenditures will emerge victorious and has the opportunity to tackle the rising costs of health insurance, prescription drugs, and other medical costs.",

        "text": "First Democrat in Congress calls on Biden to withdraw from 2024 election after debate\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, became the first sitting Democrat in Congress to call for President Joe Biden to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race, citing his poor debate performance and the fact that he \u201chas trailed Donald Trump\u201d all year in surveys.\n\n\u201cOur overriding consideration must be who has the best hope of saving our democracy from an authoritarian takeover by a criminal and his gang. Too much is at stake to risk a Trump victory\u2014too great a risk to assume that what could not be turned around in a year, what was not turned around in the debate, can be turned around now,\" Doggett said in a statement Tuesday. \"President Biden saved our democracy by delivering us from Trump in 2020. He must not deliver us to Trump in 2024.\"\n\nWhile numerous Democrats have privately expressed concerns or suggested anonymously that Biden leave the race, Doggett, who is 77, is the first lawmaker to say it openly. He represents a blue district based in Austin and has served in Congress since 1995.\n\n\u201cI represent the heart of a congressional district once represented by Lyndon Johnson,\" he continued. \"Under very different circumstances, he made the painful decision to withdraw. President Biden should do the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am hopeful that he will make the painful and difficult decision to withdraw. I respectfully call on him to do so,\u201d he said.\n\nIt is unclear whether \u2014 or how many \u2014 Democratic lawmakers will follow suit as Biden and his team insist he will stay in the race and be the party\u2019s nominee. A Biden campaign official said he is \u201cstaying in\u201d and noted that other Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., have provided supportive statements standing behind Biden.\n\nDoggett emphasized that he believes Biden has \u201cachieved much for our country at home and abroad\u201d as president, but he added: \u201cWhile much of his work has been transformational, he pledged to be transitional. He has the opportunity to encourage a new generation of leaders from whom a nominee can be chosen to unite our country through an open, democratic process.\u201d\n\nRep. Lloyd Doggett. Tom Williams / CQ-Roll Call via Getty Images file\n\n\u201cPresident Biden has continued to run substantially behind Democratic senators in key states and in most polls has trailed Donald Trump. I had hoped that the debate would provide some momentum to change that. It did not. Instead of reassuring voters, the President failed to effectively defend his many accomplishments and expose Trump\u2019s many lies,\u201d Doggett said.\n\nHe argued that the Supreme Court\u2019s immunity ruling adds fresh urgency to the task of defeating Trump. \u201cThis week, with the Supreme Court creating 'a law-free zone around the President,' Trump, newly-empowered with immunity, could usher America into a long, dark, authoritarian era unchecked by either the courts or a submissive Republican Congress,\u201d Doggett said.\n\nAfter Doggett\u2019s call, Democratic candidate Adam Frisch, who is running in Colorado\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, also called on Biden to exit, saying neither he nor Trump should be running for president.\n\n\u201cWe deserve better. President Biden should do what\u2019s best for the country and withdraw from the race,\u201d said Frisch, who lost by a razor-thin margin to Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert in 2022.\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro \u2014 a Housing and Urban Development secretary in the Obama-Biden administration who clashed with Biden as a 2020 candidate \u2014 joined the calls on MSNBC, saying there is \u201ca stable of Democrats\u201d who would be more effective against Trump, including Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n\u201cHe is not the campaigner he was in 2020,\u201d Castro said. \u201cI believe there are stronger options out there for Democrats.\u201d\n\nRep. Jared Golden of Maine, one of five House Democrats who represent Trump districts, published an opinion piece in the Bangor Daily News saying: \u201cWhile I don\u2019t plan to vote for him, Donald Trump is going to win. And I\u2019m OK with that.\u201d\n\nHe said democracy \u201cwill be just fine\u201d under Trump.",

        "text": "\u2018Waiting in the wings\u2019: as Biden stumbles, Gavin Newsom\u2019s name is on everyone\u2019s lips\nTo paraphrase Jan Brady of the Brady Bunch, lately it\u2019s been \u201cNewsom, Newsom, Newsom\u201d all day long.\n\nHe\u2019s been at the Vatican for a climate summit, and in Alpharetta, Georgia, for a televised debate with Florida governor Ron DeSantis. He\u2019s all over the TV, actually \u2013 on Fox News and MSNBC, and in advertisements airing in Tennessee.\n\nAnd ever since Joe Biden\u2019s catastrophic performance at the first presidential debate on CNN, his name has popped up in nearly every list of possible successors. With just four months to go until the presidential election, chances that the president would step aside now are exceedingly remote \u2013 but that hasn\u2019t stopped the speculation. Online political betting odds that Gavin Newsom, the California governor, would end up at the top of the presidential ticket this year tripled to a one-in-four chance last week.\n\nFor the ambitious governor of the most populous US state, this crowning moment has been a long time in the making. For years, Newsom\u2019s flair for a photo op and steady pursuit of network news spots have fueled speculation about his presidential ambitions, and sparked scepticism among constituents who\u2019d rather he stick to his day job. Now, it seems, the man who has spent the last several years seeking a national stage has finally found himself at the centre of one.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s been clear that he\u2019s been waiting in the wings for some time,\u201d said Emily Hoeven, an opinion columnist at the San Francisco Chronicle and politics reporter who has followed Newsom\u2019s career closely. \u201cBut I think that now there is a far bigger opening for him than there ever has been.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Gavin Newsom, surrounded by the media following the first 2024 presidential election debate. Photograph: Michael Reynolds/EPA\n\nThe governor was swarmed by the press the moment the debate ended. \u201cIt was like human piranhas descending on the governor after the end of this debate,\u201d marvelled MSNBC host Alex Wagner, as she settled in for a post-debate interview with him.\n\nNewsom, who is top surrogate for Biden\u2019s 2024 campaign, waved away the buzz about whether he would replace Biden on the Democratic ticket. When Wagner asked about growing calls for Biden to step down, he quickly said such talk was \u201cunhelpful and unnecessary\u201d \u2013 before highlighting Biden\u2019s record on the economy and abortion, and the threats his opponent poses to the continuation of US democracy.\n\n\u201cI think what you\u2019ve seen is this, what Gavin Newsom has to say is really not so different from what Joe Biden has to say,\u201d said Bill Whalen, a policy fellow at the Hoover Institution thinktank in Palo Alto, California. \u201cBut he takes Joe Biden\u2019s message, and he delivers it much more effectively.\u201d\n\nFor Democrats across the US, Whalen said, Newsom is living out a dream scenario \u2013 leading a blue state with a Democratic supermajority in the legislature, where he can easily pass liberal reforms that would be nearly impossible to get through in other states or at a national level. \u201cA lot of what Democrats would love to do nationally, California is doing,\u201d Whalen said.\n\nIt has also helped that as California governor \u2013 one who handily defeated a recall campaign in 2021 \u2013 Newsom has amassed formidable political funds that he has been using not only to aid other Democratic candidates including Biden, but also his own political aspirations. Since his easy re-election in 2022, the governor has funnelled millions in campaign funds towards ads and appearances outside his home state.\n\nWhether he can translate that momentum into a successful national campaign remains uncertain, Whalen and other political analysts said.\n\nView image in fullscreen Gavin Newsom has waved off speculation that he wants Joe Biden\u2019s job. Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n\nWhile he has been busy pursuing the national limelight, his reputation at home has soured. Only 47% of likely voters in California approved of his job performance in a Public Policy Institute of California survey in June, down from 57% in March 2023.\n\nIt may not help Newsom\u2019s case that amid recent budget shortages, the state has been grappling with a spiralling homelessness crisis, an underperforming education system and growing economic inequality.\n\n\u201cI think that his actions demonstrate that his priorities are increasingly lying outside of California,\u201d said Hoeven. \u201cAnd I think that that is frustrating to Californians who obviously did not elect him to be the president.\u201d\n\nIn recent months, Newsom has appeared to abandon some of his more progressive political stances \u2013 including backtracking on support for supervised injection sites, vetoing a bill to decriminalize psychedelic mushrooms and occasionally siding with Republicans and against allies in the legislature \u2013 which some supporters have perceived as an appeal to swing voters.\n\nBut it remains unclear whether the liberal governor of a blue state will ever truly have what it takes to amass national support in an increasingly divided country. And while his powerful political connections have helped his star rise in California, it is unclear whether he will be able to shed a certain elitist affect that has dogged his campaigns here.\n\nThen there\u2019s the enduring image that\u2019s haunted the governor\u2019s political career for two decades: a photograph of Newsom stretched across a luxurious rug in Ann Getty\u2019s penthouse, with his ex-wife Kimberly Guilfoyle \u2013 who is now a rightwing TV personality and Donald Trump\u2019s daughter-in-law.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Democratic governor has sought out national opportunities such as a debate with Florida\u2019s Republican governor Ron DeSantis. Photograph: Robin Rayne/ZUMA Press Wire/Shutterstock\n\nIt will be easy for opponents to hearken back to the governor\u2019s infamously ill-timed visit to the Michelin-starred French Laundry restaurant amid a Covid-19 surge, or to point out his family\u2019s decision to move, part-time, from California\u2019s capitol in Sacramento to the wealthy Bay Area enclave of Marin \u2013 to enrol their child in a private academy.\n\nIn a recent bit on Jimmy Kimmel Live, comedian Josh Meyers plays \u201cyour lovin\u2019 Govin\u201d in a fake political ad where Meyers-as-Newsom attempts a bench press in his signature startup-chic navy business jacket and half-buttoned white shirt while promoting \u201clunar power\u201d. He huffs a vape and when someone asks for a hit he says: \u201cSure, but I only vape merlot\u201d without breaking out of his toothpaste commercial smile.\n\n\u201cThere is such a thing as perhaps being too attractive, or, more to the point, looking like the person whose photo comes with the new wallet that you buy at the department store,\u201d said Whalen. \u201cThat\u2019s Gavin Newsom.\u201d\n\nHoeven thinks back to Newsom\u2019s inauguration in 2023, when he led what was billed as an \u201canti-January 6 march to the capitol\u201d. He was meant to march about a quarter-mile, alongside supporters, down to the governor\u2019s office. \u201cBut in reality, there were these massive fences up on either side of the promenade, basically, so the average person could not participate or really even watch the parade,\u201d she recalled.\n\nThe governor walked only a little bit, before getting into a car. \u201cIt was emblematic of some of the ways that he\u2019s failed to connect, I think, with the average person,\u201d she said.",

Most voters think Democrats have a better chance of keeping the White House if Biden isn\u2019t the nominee, a CNN poll found this week. The BBC spoke to Democratic voters who reflected that concern but who also worried about the logistics of switching candidates this far into the campaign. As the party confronts this thorny question, we asked voters what they want to see Democrats do next and who they think could replace Mr Biden. Familiar names include Vice-President Kamala Harris, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, California Governor Gavin Newsom and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. We start with a voter who feels the Democratic party is not listening to its constituents and wants a fresh face atop the ticket in place of Mr Biden.\n\nThey give us these text messages \"Are you going to support President Biden for re-election?\" and I said \"no\". I don't want someone who doesn't have the ability to continue in office for a very long time. I'm just tired. They push who they think is going to get elected without listening to our voices. We want someone younger, we want someone who has new ideas, has new ways to engage the whole country. But at the same time, what do I do now? He should step aside. I'm hoping we get someone fresh, but I don't know who. Other candidates don't get the air time, so I have to do my own research. I want someone new. I wish he would step down. I wish he would recognize as president, you're the president of the people. Listen to the people, listen to us. I definitely have been watching the governor of Michigan [Whitmer]. I think we need a woman as president and that's who I would like on a ticket.\n\nKyle worries the Democratic party has no game plan and is dismissing voters' concerns about Biden's abilities. I think there has to be a serious discussion about Biden stepping down... In the end, it's up to Joe Biden, but I think at very least, there should be some other candidates floated to be able to to articulate what our our game plan is going forward... I think the more the party tries to tell the public to not believe what we saw during that debate, it's going to take me from believing we should maybe just deal with Biden to we need a change. A lot of Democratic voters feel gas lit. We're being asked to not believe what we saw, and being told that this is a one off, and we know that this is not a one-off. There's been a lot that's been accomplished, but if we can't articulate those messages, we can't win, which means that vision ceases to continue. The president - they affect down ballot races, and those down ballot races could mean catastrophe with what's at stake in this election. Gretchen Whitmer would be an excellent example of someone who could replace Biden, or Pete Buttigieg, but I think at this stage, it's difficult to say. But I think a Whitmer-Buttigieg ticket could win. We need people and Democratic candidates who are from Midwestern states or other states who know how to communicate a little bit better with people in their constituencies.\n\nThis voter thinks Biden never should have run for this second term, but he is concerned that it is too late in the process to replace Biden. On the one hand, I personally wouldn't mind him stepping down, but that does lead me to a lot of scepticism that whoever replaces him as the nominee would have the capabilities and momentum to beat Trump. It is a tough question of who could replace Biden. Realistically, I don't think my policy positions totally align with VP [Kamala] Harris, but I do think that, honestly, she'd probably be the best choice for president in terms of logistics, in terms of name recognition. If he were to step down, she's the clear successor. She's already part of the ticket. That said, I think if we could go back in time and rerun the primary system and actually have a proper voting primary with a field of candidates, I'd probably be more likely to lean towards someone who has a bit more support in the midwest and rust belt states. Someone like Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer or Illinois Governor JB Pritzker.\n\nSomething needs to happen. The Democrats need to have a moment of, \"hey, this is what we did wrong\". Let's have a conversation about if Biden is truly viable or not. Is he the best to beat Trump now? I don't think anyone can confidently say he is. Possibly Gavin Newsom is. He's primed himself as the best alternative, knowing that this opportunity would come up. If he runs, he's just a name that people can get behind. He has a face that people like. He has a great family. I just don't know another name in the Democratic Party who, at this stage of the race, could catch up. Gavin Newsom, who has primed himself to be in that position, or [Pennsylvania Governor] Josh Shapiro, who is an underdog that can really get there.\n\nThis voter, who is a progressive Democrat, would love to see Biden replaced on the Democratic ticket but worries that it's too late. I'm conflicted. Personally, yes, I think Biden should step down, but realistically and logistically, no - the primary is done. He has won the Democratic nomination, even though participation in the primaries for an incumbent president is more of a formality. You have other candidates, like Newsom, Whitmer, Pritzker, Harris, who could technically be good candidates to replace him, but the plan should have been put in place years ago, if not a year ago, in my opinion. Yeah, I would personally like to see Biden replaced, but I don't see how that would logistically happen. I would like to see Pritzker on the ticket. It seems to me that Newsom is the heir apparent, but I would say Pritzker and maybe Harris, or Harris-Pritzker. Pritzker has a more progressive policy that he's enacted in Illinois that could expand as a vision for the rest of the country. Biden's done a good job as president, and I think his legacy as a decent one-term caretaker president is at risk by trying to hold on to power. His legacy is absolutely in the gutter if he loses to Trump, in a landslide, which seems to be a possibility.\n\nIt's too late. We're too close to the election to have a switch. If there was a single person that everyone could immediately get behind, maybe. But I don't think that person exists right now. I think if Kamala Harris came in, there'd be all these people complaining about her. Or if Pete Buttigieg came in, people complaining about him. So I think right now, where we are right now, I think it's too late to switch. If Biden were to drop out, I like Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg. Kamala Harris has the most name recognition, so I like her quite a lot, but I know that she also turns a lot of people off. I would worry that she would cause people not to show up to vote, but I guess I would support her.\n\nJessica doesn't know how the Democrats can come back from Joe Biden's debate performance without replacing him. I want to see him replaced. I feel guilty or bad saying that or thinking that. If Joe Biden stays in the race, I'll be voting for Joe Biden. But I don't see how he can come back from that debate performance. There are a lot of people who folks would be genuinely excited to vote for and I think now it's really a feeling of dread. Gretchen Whitmer is a name that has been thrown around who I think would be great. Josh Shapiro is wonderful. Those are two that come to mind who I think people would be excited about. I'd be excited to vote for Josh Shapiro, I'd be excited to vote for Gretchen Whitmer, I'd be excited to vote for Gavin Newsom. I don't even know a ton about Gavin Newsom, but from what I do know, I think there would be a level of excitement just knowing we have somebody other than Joe Biden who is qualified and capable and dynamic and decades younger.",

        "text": "What a mess: Doddering Biden, scheming Supreme Court, vacuous Kansas lawmakers implicate all of us \u2022 Kansas Reflector\nFrom Thursday to Monday, we all saw a lot of consequences play out, plain as day.\n\nWe saw the consequence of two parties choosing men manifestly unfit to run for president. One a direct threat to our United States of America, the other barely able to string sentences together and staring blankly into the distance as if trying to process how he arrived there.\n\nWe saw the consequences of a U.S. Supreme Court packed with hard-right appointees, eager to hand over practically unchecked power to the man they (likely correctly) assume will be the next president.\n\nMost of all, we\u2019ve seen the consequences of a nation that has for too long gorged itself on cheap cynicism and infantile entertainment.\n\nWe picked Trump and Biden. We elected the U.S. representatives and senators who pass budgets and confirm nominees. We have gone along with all of this and have allowed our government to reach this exigency. Changing the situation doesn\u2019t require magic. It requires civic engagement and participation on a level with which most of us are unfamiliar.\n\nI can lay out what I think should happen.\n\nYes, obviously President Joe Biden needs to drop out. Yes, obviously Republicans should have never countenanced Donald Trump as their nominee after he attempted to overthrow the government he led. One of these situations can still be addressed, while the other one appears set in stone. So Democratic leaders need to decide where they stand.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision on presidential immunity can be understood as either dire or limited. I\u2019ve read chunks of Chief Justice John Robert\u2019s majority opinion, as well as Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor\u2019s dissent. They seem to be writing from different universes, never mind different planets. We have no way to know the consequences without time passing and observing how our presidents and courts react.\n\nNo one can change that. At least not right away.\n\nUnfortunately, Kansas has a limited role to play in this upcoming national election. The state will almost certainly vote for the Republican presidential nominee, as it has done in every election since 1964. That\u2019s what happens when the nation still abides by the absurd Electoral College system.\n\nYet we all have roles to play when it comes to our own state and communities. Elections at these levels matter, and local candidates can present stark choices. But you won\u2019t know about your options unless you pay attention.\n\nKansas Reflector reporters are interviewing candidates for statewide office. We will be running stories about candidates and what they hope to do.\n\nRead them. Read stories in your local newspaper or news website.\n\nLast month, I wrote about the grimness that hovered over the Kansas Legislature\u2019s not-so-special session. You remember that, right? When all the state lawmakers came back to pass a tax cut plan and big incentive packages for sports teams?\n\nThat session was a consequence, too. So was the dogged refusal of leaders to allow votes on Medicaid expansion or marijuana legalization.\n\nKansans elected those people. They supported leaders who would rather line the pockets of billionaires than look out for the 12% of Kansans who live in poverty. Every one of those people could be helped, if Kansans decided they wanted to do so. But we haven\u2019t.\n\nNo, here in the Sunflower State, voters hand over their brains and willpower to the various dark money groups sending out glossy mailers. In any other situation, in any other area of life, would you believe a piece of mail that arrives at your home from someone you don\u2019t know telling obvious lies about someone else? Of course not. It boggles my mind that these pieces of junk hold such sway in the world of Kansas politics.\n\nThey only hold that sway, of course, because voters let them.\n\nThe hateful inertia of Kansas politics and the blazing Dumpster fire of the presidential election are one and the same story.\n\nThey are both the story of politicians and voters too vacuous to challenge one another to do better. They are both the story of big money interests doing all they can to dominate the discussion and eliminate dissent. They are both the story of business conglomerates pumping us full of literal and figurative narcotics \u2014 anything to dull our realization that we have made these choices and bear responsibility for this world.\n\nWe can\u2019t fix this mess alone. But we can demand better from those hoping to represent us.\n\nNot tomorrow, not after the next election, not when it\u2019s our turn.\n\nNow.\n\nClay Wirestone is Kansas Reflector opinion editor.

        "text": "What happens if Biden or Trump leaves his party\u2019s ticket?\nThis fact check originally appeared on PolitiFact.\n\nPresident Joe Biden\u2019s debate performance, which was widely panned including by some Democrats, has led some in his party to fret about whether the 81-year-old can defeat the expected Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump, in November.\n\nREAD MORE: Debate-watchers in the Biden and Trump camps seem to agree on something: Biden had a bad night\n\nMeanwhile, though Trump\u2019s own status as presumptive nominee remains strong within his party, his pending sentencing on a 34-count felony conviction, and his age of 78, have raised similar questions among critics.\n\nWhat would happen if either candidate, for whatever reason, is unable to run as the nominee?\n\nIn an updated version of an article we published in February, we\u2019ll look at a rundown of several scenarios.\n\nWhat if the presumptive nominee gives up the nomination before the start of convention?\n\nBiden has shown no inclination to step down, either before or after the debate. At a Raleigh, North Carolina, event the day after the debate, Biden roared to supporters, \u201cWhen you get knocked down, you get back up!\u201d And leading party figures, notably former President Barack Obama, have expressed confidence in Biden as the party\u2019s presumptive nominee.\n\nUnless a wide swath of party leaders comes out publicly against Biden, the likelihood of a switch in nominees seems unlikely, despite the panic within some Democratic circles, political experts said.\n\nIf it did happen, much would hinge on timing, especially around the party conventions. Republicans will hold their convention in Milwaukee from July 15-18; the Democrats will hold theirs in Chicago from Aug. 19-22.\n\nBiden could forgo the nomination voluntarily. Although dislodging him against his will is theoretically possible, it\u2019s much less likely, because the process of choosing delegates means that the ones \u201cultimately selected are quite loyal\u201d to Biden, said Josh Putnam, a political scientist specializing in delegate selection rules and founder of the political consulting firm FHQ Strategies LLC.\n\nForcing Biden out of the nomination would depend on delegates using a party rule that says they can fail to back the candidate they represent \u201cin all good conscience.\u201d\n\nIn the scenario that Biden cedes the nomination on his own, the delegates allocated during the primary season would decide the successor. Because these delegates are almost entirely pledged to him, any Biden endorsement of a nominee would carry significant weight, though even pledged Biden delegates could choose to spurn his choice.\n\nREAD MORE: 3 key moments from CNN\u2019s Biden-Trump debate\n\nOne natural choice for a Biden endorsement would be Vice President Kamala Harris. But at this stage of the campaign, Harris would not automatically become the presidential nominee. The delegates would have to agree to that, and Harris might face competition for the nomination from other leading Democrats, such as prominent governors or senators. (If Harris was chosen as the presidential nominee, there would need to be a separate contest to select the vice presidential nominee.)\n\nIf there is a contest for the presidential nomination, it would initially play out within the 4,000 regular delegates. If one candidate secured a majority, he or she would get the nomination. If it went to a second ballot, another group of delegates \u2014 party leaders and elected officials known as \u201csuperdelegates\u201d \u2014 could weigh in and perhaps break the deadlock.\n\nBecause running mates can\u2019t hail from the same state, Gavin Newsom, the Democratic governor of California, would face an obstacle if he were to share the ticket with Harris. Both come from California, and that poses a similar problem with securing electoral college votes as Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., would have if he were to be tapped as the ticketmate for Trump, a fellow Floridian.\n\nThe Republican process would be broadly similar to that for the Democrats, but given the strength of Trump\u2019s support within the party, the possibility of him being forced off the ticket is considered even more remote.\n\nEither way, any vacancy that leaves an unsettled convention, rather than one that\u2019s carefully choreographed, as has been standard in recent decades, could become a political show for the ages, with furious backroom lobbying to secure delegate support.\n\nOne quirk this year is that, given concerns about an early deadline for ballot access in Ohio, Democrats are planning to formally nominate their candidate before the convention opens, rather than at the convention, where a roll call of the state delegations is typically a highlight. Though details of this advance nominating process are not finalized, that\u2019s supposed to happen by Aug. 7, or less than six weeks after the June 27 debate.\n\nWhat if the presumptive nominee is nominated at the convention but quits the presidential race before Election Day?\n\nIf Biden or Trump is approved as the nominee at their respective conventions but has to leave the ticket before Election Day on Nov. 5, the rules of succession would be different.\n\nFirst, if Biden were to die in office (or be made to relinquish the presidency because of incapacity under the 25th Amendment), Harris would become the incumbent president. Harris would also become president immediately if Biden were to simply resign as president.\n\nREAD MORE: On campaign trail, Harris defends Biden as Democrats panic over his debate performance\n\nWhat would this mean for the presidential nomination? On the Democratic side, the rules would empower the Democratic National Committee to name a successor. While Harris would not automatically become the nominee, that would be considered the most likely option, assuming she wanted the nod.\n\nIf Harris were elevated to presidential nominee, the same process would determine the new vice presidential nominee. This happened in 1972, when the DNC named Sargent Shriver as the vice presidential nominee after Missouri Sen. Thomas Eagleton left the ticket following revelations about his mental health.\n\nThe Republican rules are murkier. A reconvening of the national convention is possible, but the Republican National Committee could probably find an alternative mechanism, Putnam said. Regardless, \u201cit would not be as clean or as clear a move as the process on the Democratic side,\u201d Putnam said.\n\nWhat happens between the election of a president and their inauguration?\n\nIf a new president is elected but dies before inauguration, the duly elected vice president would become the next president. A new vice president to serve alongside the newly elevated president would need to be approved by the Senate and the House, as happened when Congress approved Nelson Rockefeller after Gerald Ford took over for Richard Nixon, who had resigned amid the Watergate scandal.\n\nThere\u2019s still room for more wackiness. According to The Washington Post, if the winner dies between when the electoral votes are cast and when Congress counts them Jan. 6, 2025, it\u2019s not entirely clear what would happen, even for the National Archives and Records Administration, whose job it is to know.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what would happen\u201d in that scenario, the agency says on its website.\n\nPolitiFact Staff Writer Marta Campabadal Graus contributed to this report.",

How likely is that? And what would happen if he did?\n\nAfter the first debate between US President Joe Biden and his presumptive challenger Donald Trump last Thursday night, it's no exaggeration to say that the liberal-leaning part of the country was in despair.\n\nAgain and again throughout the night, Biden sounded frail and delivered sentences that made no sense. Social media users joked that Vice President Kamala Harris should be \"subbed in\" during commercial breaks, and that the debate resembled a humiliating family fight.\n\nBiden was not able to dispel voters' concerns about his age during the first presidential debate on June 27 Image: Mike Blake/REUTERS\n\nSince then, Biden has blamed his performance on exhaustion from extensive international travel before the debate, and a little bit of calm has settled in.\n\n\"Where the time right after the debate saw a lot of nervous energy run through the party, the last couple of days have been a shoring up of the Democratic basis,\" Cathryn Cl\u00fcver Ashbrook, a German-American trans-Atlantic politics expert with the German Bertelsmann Foundation, told DW.\n\n\"And would-be candidates that were floated to replace Joe Biden immediately after the debate have come out very strongly in support of the president.\"\n\nCalifornia's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, who was among those being suggested as a replacement, said on US broadcaster MSNBC, \"You don\u2019t turn your back [on your candidate] because of one performance. What kind of party does that?\"\n\nNot everyone in the Democratic Party sees it the same way. Lloyd Doggett, a member of the US House of Representatives from Texas, became the first sitting Democrat in Congress to call for Biden to step back on Tuesday.\n\n\"Recognizing that, unlike Trump, President Biden's first commitment has always been to our country, not himself, I am hopeful that he will make the painful and difficult decision to withdraw,\" Doggett was quoted by The Associated Press news agency. \"I respectfully call on him to do so.\"\n\nHow likely is Biden to step down?\n\nDoggett is not a major player, but concerns about Biden's age have only gotten stronger since the debate last Thursday.\n\nSwitching out a candidate, especially a sitting president, this late in the race would be highly unusual. But it's not impossible.\n\n\"To replace a candidate at this point, ideally, he would step back himself,\" said Filippo Trevisan, an associate professor at American University's School of Communication in Washington. \"That would be simplest.\"\n\nTrevisan also said, though, that he does not see Biden, who has been in national politics all of his adult life, giving up on the chance to win a second term in the White House.\n\n\"Things could change over the next week when they look at poll numbers,\" said Trevisan, a US politics and campaign expert. \"But right now, based on what we've heard from [Biden] and his campaign team, I think it's highly unlikely he'd step down.\"\n\nOn Monday, the Biden campaign released an ad showing a forceful Biden talking to a crowd, saying, \"I know I'm not a young man, but I know how to do this job\u2026 and I know like millions of Americans know, when you get knocked down, you get back up.\"\n\nWhat would happen if Biden did step down?\n\nIn the primaries, supporters of the Democrats and Republicans cast ballots for who they want to be their candidate. Whoever wins in each of the 50 states receives the support of that state's delegates. At the Democratic National Convention in August, these delegates will vote on who will be the Democrat's presidential candidate. The vast majority of them are pledged to Biden. They are not legally required to vote for him, but by virtue of how the US primary process works, it's what is expected of them.\n\nIf Biden steps down, \"it's a free-for-all,\" said Trevisan. \"They could vote for whomever they want.\"\n\nThat's what is called an open convention, and delegates would vote according to their conscience. Democratic Party leadership would pick a candidate that they think has the best chance of winning the presidential election, and then try to get delegates to back him or her.\n\n\"I would say Harris really has the right of first refusal.,\" J. Miles Coleman, an election analyst with the University of Virginia Center for Politics, told DW right after the debate.\n\nBiden-Trump debate: Voters underwhelmed by TV clash To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nBut Trevisan said picking Harris in such a case might not actually be the best move.\n\n\"Her association with the Biden presidency could be a negative,\" he said. \"Her approval numbers are similar to Biden's.\"\n\nWhen a president becomes incapacitated while in office, for example, through a medical emergency, the vice president takes on the job. But Harris would not automatically become the candidate if the president were to step down ahead of the convention.\n\nPossible Biden replacements: Harris, Newsom, Whitmer\n\nA number of names have been floated, particularly in the days after the debate, for who could become the presidential candidate if Biden was out of the picture. In addition to Vice President Harris and California's Governor Newsom, there is also Governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan.\n\nWhitmer was first elected governor in 2018 and reelected in 2022. Her reelection was considered a big success \u2015 2022 was a midterm election under a Democratic president (Biden), and it's usually harder for candidates from the incumbent's party to win over voters. But Whitmer managed to win another term with a larger-than-expected margin and in the important battleground state of Michigan, which is not considered a sure-fire win state for Democrats like California or New York.\n\nBut just like other powerful Democrats, Whitmer has publicly supported Biden after the debate, writing on social media platform X that \"we need to reelect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.\"\n\nNancy Pelosi of California, who was speaker of the House for two terms and is somewhat of a grande dame in the Democratic Party, has called on both Biden and Trump to undergo tests for their health and mental acuity. But according to AP, she also emphasized that Biden is on \"top of his game, in terms of knowing the issues and what is at stake.\"\n\nCould another candidate be elected against Biden's will?\n\nWhat if Biden doesn't step down, but Democrats still want to install another candidate at the convention in August?\n\n\"That's not going to work unless the Democratic Party statutes are overruled or changed,\" said Cl\u00fcver Ashbrook of the Bertelsmann Foundation. The US, after all, \"have had primaries where Joe Biden has claimed 99% of the delegates. To willingly go against a delegate vote, that circumvents a democratic process. When the country is in a perilous moment in its own democracy, nobody is going to attempt that in the Democratic Party.\"\n\nIf Biden were to drop out even later \u2014 after the convention, for instance, over health reasons \u2014 not even the delegates could vote on a candidate. Instead, the Democratic National Committee would convene and decide on a candidate \u2015 something that would certainly fuel discussions on the state of US democracy.\n\nEdited by: Andreas Illmer",

        "text": "Polling Insight: 4 Takeaways About Black Women Voters in the 2024 Election\nFor decades, Black women have consistently been a reliable voting base for the Democratic Party, and in recent elections Democrats have garnered support from large majorities of Black women. However, the KFF Survey of Women Voters shows that many Black women do not feel either political party is looking out for their interests, and express dissatisfaction with their candidate options. Black women experienced disproportionate economic setbacks during the pandemic, with their unemployment rate outpacing that of men and women of other racial and ethnic groups. While pandemic-related unemployment has receded, rising inflation rates have created a scenario in which many families across the country struggle to afford basic household expenses, and Black women are more likely than White or Hispanic women to cite these struggles. This poll shows that, while Black women still largely support President Biden in 2024, some of his previous supporters say they don\u2019t plan to vote for him this fall. Among Black women voters, one quarter of those who voted for Joe Biden in 2020 now say they either plan to vote for Trump in 2024 (8%) or say they will not vote (14%). This analysis highlights the deciding factors and motivations for Black women fewer than six months before the 2024 election.\n\nThe analysis presented below is from a multi-mode probability based survey of women voters from state-level voter files, fielded May 23-June 5, 2024. The KFF Survey of Women Voters Dashboard includes more data from the survey, as well as the topline and full methodological details.\n\n#1: Black Women Continue to Identify with the Democratic Party, Though Some Say Neither Party Does a Better Job Looking Out for People Like Them\n\nBlack women voters largely identify as Democrats (67%) or lean toward the Democratic Party (10%) and a majority say that the Democratic Party does a better job than the Republican Party looking out for people like them (56%), but about one in three Black women (35%) say neither party looks out for people like them. Fewer Black women voters identify as Republicans (7%) or say that the Republican Party does a better job looking out for their interests (8%).\n\n#2: Inflation Is the Most Important Issue for Black Women Voters, and Most Disapprove of Biden\u2019s Handling of It\n\nAbout half of Black women voters say that inflation, including the rising cost of household expenses (53%) is the most important issue determining their vote in the 2024 presidential race. Ranking far behind this issue are threats to democracy (18%), abortion (12%) and gun policy (6%). Families across the U.S. have been hit hard by the rising cost of household expenses, and Black women voters especially report worrying about affording basic household items for themselves and their families, with about half or more saying they worry \u201ca lot\u201d about affording food (59%), utilities (53%), health care (51%), and housing costs (48%).\n\nReflecting on the past two presidencies, about one in four Black women voters say they have been better off financially while President Biden is in office (27%) and a similar share say they were better off under President Trump (22%). Half (50%) of Black women voters say which president is in office has made no difference in their financial situation.\n\nHalf of Black women say, regardless of who they intend to vote for, the Democratic Party does a better job addressing the cost of household expenses (51%), while few (8%) say the Republican Party does a better job, and four in ten (41%) say neither party does a better job. However, assessing Biden\u2019s handling of the issue of inflation, a majority (55%) of Democratic Black women voters disapprove, including one in four (25%) who say they disapprove \u201cstrongly.\u201d By contrast, majorities of Democratic Black women voters approve of Biden\u2019s handling of most other issues, including immigration, abortion and reproductive health care, student loan repayment, and the affordability of health care.\n\n#3: Black Women Voters Say Candidates\u2019 Personal Qualities Are More Important than Issues to their 2024 Vote\n\nWhen deciding who to vote for this fall, Black women voters put a lot of emphasis on the candidates\u2019 personal characteristics and experience. Two-thirds (64%) of Black women voters nationally say a candidates\u2019 personal characteristics, including their leadership ability, character, values, and experience will make the biggest difference to their vote, more than twice the share who say the candidates\u2019 stance on the issues matters most (29%). Reflecting on one of these personal characteristics, a majority of Black women voters say that President Biden respects women generally (57%) and the women he interacts with \u201ca lot\u201d (61%). Very few (4% and 2% respectively) say the same of former President Trump, while majorities say Trump respects women \u201cnot at all.\u201d\n\nPartisanship may play a larger role in some state specific contexts. Along with the national poll of women voters, the KFF Survey of Women Voters included a representative sample of women voters in Michigan, a key battleground state. While just 6% of Black women nationally say that the candidates\u2019 political party will make the biggest difference to their 2024 vote, this rises to one in five Black women voters in Michigan. On par with Black women nationally, Black women voters in Michigan give the Democratic Party the edge on their assessment of which political party does a better job looking out for people like them, the interests of women, addressing the cost of health care and the cost of household expenses.\n\n#4: Young Black Women Are Less Likely to Say They Will Vote in This Election Than Older Black Women; Many Say Their Dissatisfaction Is Due to Unfulfilled Promises\n\nSimilar majorities of Black women across age say they are dissatisfied with their options for president, but views of the candidates may be impacting younger Black women\u2019s decision to turn out more than older Black women. About three in four Black women ages 50 and older (77%) say they are \u201cabsolutely certain\u201d to vote. Fewer Black women under age 50 say they are certain to vote (49%), while one-third say there is a 50-50 chance (32%). Seven percent of Black women ages 18 to 49 say they probably or certainly will not vote in November.\n\nThis age difference among Black women reflects a broader pattern among women voters who identify as Democrats. Overall, younger Democratic women voters are more likely than their older counterparts to say they disapprove of the president\u2019s handling of issues and are less likely to say they plan to vote.\n\nWhen asked why they are not satisfied with President Biden as the Democratic nominee for president, many Democratic Black women voters cite answers related to Biden\u2019s age and ability to act as president, and cite unfulfilled campaign promises of the Biden administration.\n\nWhat is the main reason why you aren\u2019t satisfied with Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee for president? \u201cPresident Biden is not in sync with the overwhelming majority of the country on issues that directly affect economic security, housing, over policing, women\u2019s right to health autonomy and international relations that directly influence the safety of non-white identifying Americans.\u201d \u2013 47-year-old Black woman voter, Democratic-leaning independent, California \u201cPromises he made fell to wayside, feels like too little too late from him.\u201d \u2013 38-year-old Black woman, Democrat, Georgia \u201cConcerned about longevity. I feel like a younger Democratic candidate could fight for more and harder for our community.\u201d \u2013 28-year-old Black woman, Democrat, New York \u201cI realize that at his age, he is not the aggressive VP he once was. I don\u2019t think he is as sharp as he will need to be.\u201d \u2013 66-year-old Black woman, Democrat, Illinois\n\nWith pollsters forecasting a close presidential election, even slight advantages could tip the electoral balance in favor of either candidate. Black women voters have long been a strong base to the Democratic Party, and this poll finds their continued support for the party. However, if Black women do not feel adequately represented by the current leadership of the Democratic Party, including on issues most salient to them, they may not vote for Joe Biden in the fall. Young Black women are especially frustrated and dissatisfied with the current administration, which may tip the scales in favor of a Trump presidency.",

        "text": "Should the Democrats replace Joe Biden as presidential candidate? History says it's a risky move\nJoe Biden has jet lag. Joe Biden has a cold. Joe Biden was over-prepared. Joe Biden was under-prepared. Joe Biden has a stutter.\n\nDefenders of the president have trotted out plenty of excuses since last week's catastrophic first debate against Donald Trump, but they have left unsaid the glaringly obvious conclusion: Joe Biden is too old.\n\nAmerica's politicians are amongst the oldest in the world Photo shows A composite image of Mitch McConnel, Joe Biden, Donald Trump and Nancy Pelosi. In the lead-up to the US election, many are concerned that Biden and Trump, the two oldest people to ever run for office in the US, are running again. It's indicative of a broader issue \u2014 the average age of the US congress has been climbing for decades.\n\nAt the debate he shuffled stiffly to the podium, his voice rasping barely above a whisper, his mouth often agape, his eyes blank and staring. He failed to complete sentences and mixed up words, saying \"COVID\" when he meant \"insulin\" and \"Medicare\" when he actually meant \"COVID\".\n\nMore than anything, Biden failed to lay a glove on former president Donald Trump, allowing him to make dozens of false claims with impunity while being drawn into a infantile squabble over golf handicaps.\n\nIt was shockingly bad. When President Ronald Reagan had a sub-par first debate in 1984 against Walter Mondale, questions were asked about his age and fitness to serve another four years. At the time Reagan was 73 and his family now believes showing the first signs of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nBiden is now 81.\n\nMany Democrats thought Joe Biden was already too old to run for president in 2020 at the age of 77. That's why around two dozen other candidates \u2014 including the eventual vice president, Kamala Harris \u2014 ran against him.\n\nHeading into this year, despite being the only person to serve as president into their 80s, just one elected Democrat challenged Biden for renomination \u2014 little-known Minnesota Congressman Dean Phillips, who said he was running because Biden was too old. Phillips eventually won just four delegates, to Biden's 3,894.\n\nNow, after last week's debate, more than two-thirds of voters think Biden is too old to be president today, let alone in another four years and five months when his second term would notionally end.\n\nA handful of Democrats have publicly admitted to having serious doubts about Biden's fitness, while reports suggest privately many who have spent time with the president in recent months are concerned by his \"lapses\".\n\nIt wasn't mean to be this way.\n\nLoading...\n\nDid history scare off challengers to Biden's nomination?\n\nIn 2020 Biden seemed to imply he would only serve a single four-year term, referring to himself as a \"bridge\" and a \"transitional\" president. His decision last year to seek a second term came in the afterglow of a solid 2022 midterm election result where Democrats were boosted by the conservative Supreme Court's overturning of the constitutional right to have an abortion.\n\nBiden remained convinced that like 2020, he is the best-placed Democrat to defeat Donald Trump.\n\nBut there's another reason no high-profile Democrat challenged Biden. They all knew taking on an incumbent president for their party's nomination is almost certainly doomed to failure, and a failure that can also doom the president they challenge.\n\nIn 1980 Senator Ted Kennedy challenged incumbent President Jimmy Carter, pictured here with First Lady Rosalyn Carter in 1976, leaving him wounded politically. The Democrats lost the election. (AP, file)\n\nIn 1980, Senator Ted Kennedy mounted a progressive bid for the Democratic nomination against the more centrist incumbent President Jimmy Carter. Like Biden, Carter's popular support was dragged down by inflation and discontent over his handling of foreign affairs. Carter eventually saw off Kennedy's challenge but was wounded politically and crashed to defeat in the general election that November to Reagan.\n\nEven when a challenger forces the incumbent out of the race, failure has followed.\n\nTwice last century a Democratic president opted not to seek another term in office when confronted with dismal polls and primary challengers; Harry Truman in 1952 and Lyndon Johnson in 1968. Both then witnessed their successors, Adlai Stevenson in 1952 and Hubert Humphrey in 1968, go on to lose the election that followed.\n\nLoading\n\nCould Kamala Harris step in now?\n\nDisunity is death, they say, but sometimes so is staying the course when heading for defeat.\n\nAfter briefly retaking the lead in the average of national polls last week for the first time in nine months, Biden's horror debate has seen most polls swing against him. Some have shown him losing not just battleground states like Michigan and Pennsylvania, but previously safe Democratic states like New Hampshire.\n\nDesperate times may call for desperate measures, but what might that look like?\n\nThe hometown of Kamala Harris's maternal grandfather celebrated after she became US vice president. (AP: Aijaz Rahi)\n\nAs America's vice president, Kamala Harris is constitutionally the next in line. She is only ever a heartbeat away from the presidency, she has had to be prepared to take over the most powerful political office on earth at a moment's notice, as most recently Vice President Lyndon B Johnson did with the assassination of President Kennedy in November 1963.\n\nIf Joe Biden were to die or suffer a debilitating illness before January 20th 2025, Harris will become America's 47th president.\n\nIt is hard to imagine Democrats overlooking Harris as a substitute candidate if Biden withdraws from the presidential election, in part because brushing aside the first female and person of colour to become vice president (her mother is South Asian and father black) would risk alienating two key voter groups for Democrats. Having her as the nominee also ensures campaign funds raised by Biden-Harris remain with Harris-whoever.\n\nWhat other candidates are waiting in the wings?\n\nOther would-be Democratic nominees have been waging tactful shadow campaigns for months if not years \u2014 California Governor Gavin Newsom, Michigan's Governor Gretchen Whitmer, Illinois' J.B. Pritzker to name a few \u2014 and there are plenty of old rivals from 2020 who still see themselves sitting behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office: Senator Cory Booker, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Senator Amy Klobuchar.\n\nCould Joe Biden be replaced? Photo shows Joe Biden stands at a podium at the CNN presidential debate It was supposed to ease concerns about his mental and physical fitness, but instead Joe Biden's debate performance only enhanced them. Now, the pressure on the president to pull out of the election race is intensifying.\n\nAll of them would look and sound better than Biden did last week; some may even defy history and beat Donald Trump, who many voters also think is both too old and too criminal.\n\nBut for now, Biden is not budging, and the clock is ticking down fast.\n\nHe was due to be nominated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in mid-August, but a virtual formal nomination has been scheduled for mid-July in order to qualify for the ballot in Ohio.\n\nWill Harris, Newsom, Whitmer or any of the others mount a challenge before then, or will they stay loyal with their eyes fixed firmly on 2028?\n\nJohn Barron is co-host of ABCTV's Planet America and Fireside Chat programs.

        "text": "A long summer looms: PIMCO\u2019s Cantrill shares U.S. presidential election outlook\nSharing her latest commentary and analysis on the U.S. Presidential Election taking place this November, PIMCO\u2019s head of U.S. public policy, Libby Cantrill, reflects on last week\u2019s debate and assesses what it might mean for the election and for the markets\n\nOver the weekend, pundits continued to weigh in on the outlook for President Joe Biden\u2019s re-election prospects following Thursday\u2019s objectively awful debate performance. Biden not only failed to reassure swing voters that he is up for the job for another four years, but he also deflated his base and, for many, called into question whether he is up for the demands of the presidency even today.\n\nUnsurprisingly, election prediction markets have shifted, now favoring a Trump victory as a more likely outcome. Before Thursday, our view had been that the race was effectively a coin toss, but now we would agree that \u2013 with the caveat that a lot can still happen in the remaining four months \u2013 the odds undoubtedly favor former President Trump at this point, assuming Biden stays in the race. This could also have implications for down-ballot races in both the House and the Senate, and therefore on the direction of fiscal policy as well.\n\nOn whether Biden will stay in the race, the decision is his alone, not the Democratic Party\u2019s, not the donors\u2019, nor the pundits\u2019. Biden currently controls 99% of the delegates and what happens to those delegates is his decision. Of course, no candidate has ever withdrawn this late in the race; the party has planned its entire campaign around his candidacy; the mechanics of putting forth a new candidate are incredibly complicated; and there is no clear consensus alternative. All that said, while we believe the odds of Biden dropping out remain remote, they are certainly higher than they were before. If such an outcome comes to pass, we believe an announcement would be made within the next week or two.\n\nFor markets, the biggest takeaways from the debate are that deficits will remain high, the U.S. will stay hawkish on China, and tariffs are likely to go up, especially if Trump is reelected. The question is when this will be priced into markets.\n\nA rough night for the president\n\nIn the first \u2013 and potentially last \u2013 2024 presidential debate, President Biden not only underperformed the arguably low expectations set for him but also exacerbated what a majority of voters thought going into the night: He is simply too old to lead the country for four more years. Even during his better moments, Biden\u2019s performance was halting, and his clearly rehearsed lines were delivered in a hushed, hoarse voice; in his worst moments, he was downright unintelligible and incoherent. It was the opposite of his presentation at the State of the Union when he was confident, relaxed, and forceful.\n\nIn contrast, former President Trump was energetic and certainly more disciplined than his ugly performance in the first 2020 debate (a very low bar, to be sure). He often pivoted to his talking points, such as immigration.Given the outcome of last week\u2019s debate, the odds are that the Trump campaign will not agree to a second debate to avoid giving Biden an opportunity to recover. However, it remains a possibility.\n\nWhat could be more interesting \u2013 and carry higher stakes now \u2013 is the vice presidential debate scheduled for late July or August (exact date and opponent to Vice President Kamala Harris yet to be determined).\n\nThere was also (some) policy talk\n\nWhile debates tend to be much more about style than substance, there was some discussion on policy. For investors, we see three big takeaways:\n\nFirst, taxes got a lot of attention, previewing what will be a huge policy issue in Washington in 2025, when the Trump tax cuts are scheduled to expire. In Thursday\u2019s debate, Trump vowed (once again) to extend the tax cuts, while Biden (in a somewhat mangled way) said he would raise taxes on the rich while keeping the tax cuts for those making less than $400,000 annually. A Republican sweep of the White House and Congress is more likely after Thursday, so the chance of a full Trump tax cut extension that is not paid for is also more likely.\n\nSecond, there was no mention of deficit reduction or serious talk of entitlement reform, although Biden did indicate that he would support an increase in the payroll tax for those making more than $400,000. Neither candidate, nor either party, appears inclined to broach any major spending overhauls. Therefore, our view that the deficit will be the biggest loser of the election still stands, regardless of the outcome.\n\nThird, Trump once again doubled down on his tariff position, arguing that tariffs will reduce the deficit and be a win for America (and will not add to inflation). Since Trump\u2019s election in 2016, we have maintained that people should take him seriously on tariffs \u2013 he has been incredibly consistent on this issue his entire adult life. (See last month\u2019s Macro Signposts on the implications of tariffs for inflation and growth.)\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Biden\u2019s campaign?\n\nAlthough some observers speculated that the timing and format of the debate were a plan by Democrats to expose Biden\u2019s weakness and remove him from the ticket, this is simply not reality. After all, this is not the 1960s when the party, not the voters, ultimately determined the nominee. The reality is that Biden has won 99% of pledged delegates via the state primaries. Only Biden can decide to release them to vote for another candidate. While donors, pundits, friends, and Democratic insiders may call on Biden to drop out (and many others rally to defend him), the decision is his alone \u2013 and thus far, we see no indication that he is seriously contemplating stepping down.\n\nHypothetically, how would it work if Biden did drop out?\n\nTo step aside, Biden would need to announce that he will not accept the Democratic nomination and that he is releasing all of his pledged delegates. While he could suggest that these delegates support another candidate, such as Vice President Harris, he cannot force them to support a specific candidate once they are released.\n\nThis would theoretically lead to an \u201copen\u201d or \u201cbrokered\u201d Democratic Convention, starting on August 19. In this scenario, individuals would be nominated from the convention floor and try to convince the nearly 4,000 state delegates to support them. To secure the nomination, a candidate would need a simple majority of delegates (1,968 to be exact).\n\nIf no candidate earns the majority of votes on the first ballot, the process would go to a second ballot. This is where it could get interesting, as the so-called Super Delegates would be allowed to vote (until 2020, they could vote on the first ballot). These 739 individuals include members of Congress, governors, and senior party officials. At this stage, the party couldput its thumb on the scale to try to expedite an outcome.\n\nIn addition to the fact that Biden is unlikely to step down, there are other considerations:\n\nFirst, a change would need to occur within the next week or so. Although the convention is not until August, the Democratic National Committee has planned a roll call vote as early as mid-July.\n\nSecond, there is no clear consensus alternative to Biden. While Vice President Harris would be the most likely nominee, in our view, she has favorability ratings that are just as bad (if not worse) than Biden\u2019s. Although there are many up-and-coming Democratic governors, there is no clear alternative.\n\nThird, Democrats are trying to be the party of stability and no drama, and a contested convention would undermine that image. They are keen to avoid a repeat of the 1968 convention, which also took place in Chicago; it was marred by violence across the city and venomous speech and outrage among delegates. Then-Vice President Hubert Humphrey won the nomination, but lost the election.\n\nPost-debate polling\n\nPrior to Thursday\u2019s debate,Biden and Trump were effectively tied in the polls, with Trump leading in most key swing states. While Biden\u2019s polling has and will increasingly be hurt by the debate, the question remains: Who benefits? Will it be Trump, or a third-party candidate such as Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who, incidentally, could qualify for the debate stage in September? This possibility might be another reason why Trump would not be interested in debating again.\n\nAlso, how will the debate affect the down-ballot races? At this point, many of the Democratic candidates running in vulnerable House and Senate races have been outperforming Biden in the polls by several points. A key question is whether that will continue or if Biden\u2019s debate performance also affect those candidates, thereby increasing the odds of a Republican sweep come November.\n\nWhile debates rarely upend races, they can and do change voters\u2019 impressions and polling at the margins \u2013 which, in this case, could matter quite a bit.",

        "text": "A conservative leading the pro-Trump Project 2025 suggests there will be a new American Revolution\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The leader of a conservative think tank orchestrating plans for a massive overhaul of the federal government in the event of a Republican presidential win said that the country is in the midst of a \u201csecond American Revolution\u201d that will be bloodless \u201cif the left allows it to be.\u201d\n\nHeritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts made the comments Tuesday on Steve Bannon\u2019s \u201cWar Room\u201d podcast, adding that Republicans are \u201cin the process of taking this country back.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are \u201capoplectic right now\u201d because the right is winning, Roberts told former U.S. Rep. Dave Brat, one of the podcast\u2019s guest hosts as Bannon is serving a four-month prison term. \u201cAnd so I come full circle on this response and just want to encourage you with some substance that we are in the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be.\u201d\n\nRoberts\u2019 remarks shed light on how a group that promises to have significant influence over a possible second term for former President Donald Trump is thinking about this moment in American politics. The Heritage Foundation is spearheading Project 2025, a sweeping road map for a new GOP administration that includes plans for dismantling aspects of the federal government and ousting thousands of civil servants in favor of Trump loyalists who will carry out a hard-right agenda without complaint.\n\nHis call for revolution and vague reference to violence also unnerved some Democrats who interpreted it as threatening.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\n\u201cThis is chilling,\u201d former Democratic presidential candidate Marianne Williamson wrote on the social platform X. \u201cTheir idea of a second American Revolution is to undo the first one.\u201d\n\nJames Singer, a spokesperson for President Joe Biden\u2019s reelection campaign, pointed to this week\u2019s Fourth of July holiday in an emailed statement.\n\n\u201c248 years ago tomorrow America declared independence from a tyrannical king, and now Donald Trump and his allies want to make him one at our expense,\u201d Singer said, adding that Trump and his allies are \u201ddreaming of a violent revolution to destroy the very idea of America.\u201d\n\nRoberts, whose name Bannon recently floated to The New York Times as a potential chief of staff option for Trump, also said on the podcast that Republicans should be encouraged by the Supreme Court\u2019s recent immunity ruling.\n\nHe said Monday\u2019s decision \u2014 which gives presidents broad immunity from prosecution \u2014 is \u201cvital\u201d to ensure a president won\u2019t have to \u201csecond guess, triple guess every decision they\u2019re making in their official capacity.\u201d\n\nIn an emailed statement on Wednesday, Roberts reiterated his comments from the podcast, saying Americans \u201care in the process of carrying out the Second American Revolution to take power back from the elites and despotic bureaucrats.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese patriots are committed to peaceful revolution at the ballot box,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s the Left that has a long history of violence, so it\u2019s up to them to allow a peaceful transfer of power.\u201d\n\nRoberts pointed to the protests after the killing of George Floyd by police in 2020, some of which erupted into crime, vandalism and violence. Democrats, in turn, have accused their Republican counterparts of violence, using the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot in which Trump supporters tried to forcibly overturn his loss to President Joe Biden.\n\nHeidi Beirich, co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, said Roberts\u2019 comments about a \u201csecond American Revolution\u201d are \u201ca bit terrifying but also elucidating.\u201d The 1,000-page Project 2025 playbook calls for far-reaching changes in government, including rolling back protections for the LGBTQ community and infusing Christianity more deeply into society.\n\n\u201cRoberts, the Heritage Foundation, and its allies in Project 2025 want to reorder American society and fundamentally change it,\u201d Beirich said. \u201cHe\u2019s said the quiet part out loud.\u201d\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

        "text": "Would a second Trump presidency make the US more or less attractive to foreign students?\nA just-released global survey report from Intead and Studyportals, Know Your Neighbourhood, contains several surprising findings \u2013 including that a substantial segment of international students would be more likely to choose the US over other destinations if Donald Trump were to emerge the victor of the upcoming US election (5 November 2024) and become president for the second time.\n\nThe survey was conducted in March and April of 2024 and drew responses from almost 2,500 students in 106 countries. More than half (58%) were from Africa, 29% were from Asia, and 7% were from Europe; smaller numbers of students were from other regions. Most student respondents were interested in graduate (38%) or postgraduate programmes (37%) \u2013 especially programmes oriented in STEM subjects.\n\nMore than half of students were interested in STEM, while 27% were exploring Arts & Humanities and 20% were looking at Business & Finance programmes. Source: Intead/Studyportals\n\nCareer motivations a major driver, and many students want to take their skills back home\n\nAs usual, career motivations topped the list of reasons for why students were interested in study abroad, and a significant proportion of students were determined to bring skills acquired abroad home to their country. Learning English was also a common theme.\n\nTop motivations for study abroad. Source: Intead/Studyportals\n\nAlmost half of students aren\u2019t overly concerned about safety or discrimination\n\nMore than 4 in 10 students (44%) globally said they are not influenced by concerns about religious or racial discrimination, personal safety, or political instability when thinking about study abroad. This proportion rose significantly in Latin America, where three-quarters of respondents are unconcerned about discrimination or safety in a host country. More than 6 in 10 Latin Americans also said that safety issues in their own country are not a driver of their desire to study abroad.\n\nIntead/Studyportals researchers offer this hypothesis for the relatively low concern about safety and security:\n\n\u201cTaking into account both of these prompts, these respondents\u2019 generalized indifference may reflect the lifelong navigation of a complex, changeable socio-political environment of the countries\u2019 citizens, which can foster greater desensitization to changeability or alleged lack of security anywhere.\n\nWhile the percentage of respondents who cited \u2018some\u2019 to \u2018a lot\u2019 of influence remains high (66% collectively), the lack of reported concern about discrimination among nearly half of our respondents prompts us to reconsider the prevailing narratives surrounding international travel and how safety and acceptance actually impact these young adult travelers. While challenges of acceptance may exist, this substantial percentage of education-seekers are asserting their determination to pursue their academic goals regardless of their concerns about religious/racial discrimination, personal safety, and political instability.\u201d\n\nHow would a potential Trump presidency affect the US\u2019s appeal as a study destination?\n\nEight years ago, in the lead-up to the 2016 US presidential election, Intead/Studyportals ran a survey that found (1) a \u201csignificant distaste\u201d for then-nominee Donald Trump and (2) a preference for nominee Hilary Clinton. As we know, Trump won that election and during his presidential term (2016\u201320), he was strikingly committed to ensuring that Chinese and Muslim students felt unwelcome in the US. In 2017, in fact, his administration barred students in six Muslim-majority countries from coming to the US to study.\n\nUnder Trump, a trend of declining international enrolments in the US accelerated, and foreign enrolments reached an all-time low in 2020/21. That trend began reversing under President Biden and the number of foreign students in the US reached a near-record high in 2022/23. Recent IDP research has found that the US is now the frontrunner in terms of most-preferred study abroad destinations as policy changes in Australia, Canada, and the UK have diminished those countries\u2019 draw for international students.\n\nInternational enrolments in the US 2014\u201323. Source: WES\n\nWhile campaigning for the 2024 election, Trump has promised that \u201cthe most aggressive vetting process in U.S. history\u201d would ensure that only \u201cthe most skilled graduates who can make significant contributions to America\u201d will be permitted to remain after they complete their programmes. Needless to say, more restrictive policies would affect the US's competitiveness in international student markets.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s promises of heightened vigilance, and historically distrustful attitude towards immigrants and international students, do not seem to be deterring many prospective international students considering study in the US.\n\nWhen asked in this year\u2019s survey about their feelings about the upcoming November US election, 44% said that they would be more likely to study in the US if President Biden won \u2013 but a sizeable 30% said they would be more likely to do so if Donald Trump won. Moreover, 42% said it wouldn\u2019t make a difference one way or the other which candidate emerged as the victor.\n\nThis means that nearly three-quarters of respondents would not be deterred from studying in the US in the event of a second Trump presidency \u2013 a far greater proportion than the 28% who said they would be less likely to study in the US should Trump win the November election.\n\nPresident Biden is preferred over Trump by prospective international students \u2013 but not by a wide margin. Source: Intead/Studyportals\n\nRespondents\u2019 relatively mild reaction to a potential Trump victory is especially curious given that the bulk of survey participants came from Africa and Asia \u2013 the world regions with the largest number of Muslim-majority countries (and of course, China).\n\nThe Intead/Studyportals survey offered respondents an option to write in reasons for their feelings about each presidential nominee. In general, among those who favoured President Biden, the sense was that his presidency would mean \u201ca more traditional diplomatic and international relations approach, potentially fostering a more welcoming environment for international students.\u201d\n\nAs for the 30% who would be more likely to want to study in the US under a Trump presidency, written comments indicate that there is a sense that students envision better career prospects under Trump:\n\n\u201cWrite-in responses indicate that the economic growth and job creation, along with policies promoting American businesses that may accompany the Republican\u2019s leadership, could increase their career advancement and access to the US job market.\u201d\n\nIt bears noting that the US\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) has increased by 8.4% (when adjusted for inflation) in the four years of President Biden\u2019s administration, higher than the growth rate under former president Trump. But there is a longstanding notion in the US that Republicans (Trump\u2019s party) prioritise the economy more than Democrats (Biden\u2019s party) do, perhaps given Democrats\u2019 more liberal and progressive orientation.\n\nIntead/Studyportals researchers present this astute commentary:\n\n\u201cAdditionally, our experience leads us to imagine that Mr. Trump's America-first rhetoric and policies may appeal to students interested in patriotic ideologies or those seeking a more insular cultural experience. Following our logic further, to these respondents a Trump presidency might also imply that the US will be less involved in foreign affairs, and less inclined to intervene in other countries' internal issues\u2014a somewhat anti-imperial stance that could appeal to citizens of emerging/developing countries.\u201d\n\nA lot of students \u201cjust don\u2019t care\u201d about the result of the upcoming US election\n\nNearly half of surveyed students (42%) said that the political environment in the US does not make a difference to their motivation to study in the US. Intead/Studyportals researchers posit a number of theories about this finding, including the idea that the US political climate is such that students can hardly take the election seriously. Instead, they are simply focusing on the quality of US institutions and the desire for a good career.\n\nAre students becoming desensitised to political volatility in the US (and elsewhere)?\n\nThe Know Your Neighbourhood report includes the following striking graphic. Keep in mind that in 2016, the attack on the US Capitol Building (6 January 2021) by a mob of pro-Trump supporters unwilling to accept President Biden\u2019s electoral victory had not yet occurred. Nor had dozens of criminal charges and convictions against Trump yet proceeded through the courts. Still, student-respondents were twice as likely to say they would want to study in the US under Trump In 2024 as in 2016.\n\nPercentages of students saying they would be more likely to want to study in the US under a Trump presidency \u2013 2016 versus 2024. Source: Intead/Studyportals\n\nThe significantly larger proportion indicating increased interest in 2024 under Trump is in many ways astounding, especially given how Trump has approached the issue of international students in the past. But perhaps the finding can be viewed in a context of increasing youth apathy and/or cynicism about politics and politicians in general, as young people watch their world increasingly gripped by extreme weather and devastating wars. As the US heads toward the November election:\n\nThe Pew Research Centre has found that 3 in 10 people in 24 countries are in favour of authoritarian political systems \u2013 and this proportion rises in Asia and Africa. The poorer people are, the more likely they are to prefer authoritarian governments to democratically elected ones.\n\nChina and Russia, both run by ever-more controlling authoritarian regimes, are becoming more powerful around the world, and democratic countries in close proximity are feeling the pressure.\n\nIndia's democratic conventions have been challenged under President Modi.\n\nCuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela are run by dictators.\n\nT\u00fcrkiye's President Erdo\u011fan and Hungary\u2019s President Orb\u00e1n routinely block EU legislation, and democratic traditions in T\u00fcrkiye and Hungary have eroded in recent years under those leaders.\n\nMarine Le Pen\u2019s far-right party is gaining ground in France.\n\nOnly 12% of African countries are considered truly democratic.\n\nProspective students are living in an era where the idea of democracy is increasingly under pressure around the world. Amid this context, the idea that a US president who has promised to be \u201conly a dictator on Day 1\u201d may be sworn in on 5 November 2024 is not as shocking as it might once have been.\n\nIn the meantime, students still want to study in institutions that can give them the brightest future possible, and that overarching drive may be behind some of the more surprising findings of the Intead/Studyportals research.\n\nFor additional background, please see:",

No president has been more invested in empowering workers and expanding the labor movement than Joe Biden, who has stood with working people at every opportunity, including on the picket line. Under President Biden and Vice President Harris, workers are winning record contracts across the country with double-digit raises, new organizing is surging, good jobs are coming home to the United States, and pensions that millions of workers count on for retirement security are protected thanks to the American Rescue Plan. President Biden and Vice President Harris have delivered day after day for working people, taking on corporate greed to balance the scales for workers. Now it\u2019s time to finish the job with strong leadership for America\u2019s future and bold policies that will benefit working people for generations to come.\n\nPresident Biden and Vice President Harris have always had workers\u2019 backs\u2014and we will have theirs.\n\nContact: Steve Smith, 202-637-5018",

        "text": "US Presidential polls 2024: Kamala Harris favoured over Joe Biden, CNN poll shows; pressure grows for Biden to step down\nUS Presidential polls 2024: A recent CNN poll shows Vice President Kamala Harris has a better chance of winning the upcoming US presidential election in November than President Joe Biden. Biden's approval rating of 81 has dropped sharply following his poor debate performance in Atlanta last week against Donald Trump. Since the debate, there has been growing support within the Democratic Party for Biden to resign and allow another candidate to lead the charge for the crucial November 5 election.\n\nAccording to the CNN poll by SRS, Trump leads Biden by six points.\n\nThe poll also indicates that Harris is competitive against Trump in a theoretical matchup, with 47 per cent of registered voters favouring Trump and 45 per cent favouring Harris. This result falls within the margin of error, suggesting no definitive frontrunner in such a scenario.\n\nThe poll notes, \"Harris' slightly stronger performance against Trump is partly due to broader support among women (50% favour Harris over Trump compared to 44% for Biden against Trump) and independents (43% favour Harris vs 34% for Biden).\"\n\nBiden attributes poor debate performance to exhaustion from global travel. Speaking at a campaign event in Virginia on Tuesday evening without a teleprompter, Joe Biden acknowledged his debate performance was subpar, attributing it to lack of sleep. He mentioned his campaign had raised $38 million since the debate.\n\n\"I made a mistake. I travelled around the world a few times, through about 100 time zones ... before ... the debate. I didn't listen to my staff, so I returned and almost fell asleep on stage,\" Biden admitted. \"That's not an excuse, but it's an explanation.\"\n\nWhether Biden continues his 2024 bid for president after his halting debate performance against Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is primarily his decision, Democrats and political strategists have said.\n\nHowever, Biden is facing increasing pressure. Some donors have urged him to withdraw, and other Democrats are openly expressing doubts about his ability to defeat Trump in November.\n\nAccording to a House Democratic aide, 25 Democratic members of the House of Representatives are preparing to call for Biden to step aside. Another aide noted that moderate House Democrats from competitive districts are considering addressing their concerns to Biden directly after facing intense questioning from constituents this week.\n\n\"It appears that opinions are shifting,\" the source commented.\n\nAfter the debate, a Reuters/Ipsos poll indicated that one in three Democrats believes Biden should end his re-election campaign.\n\nBiden's verbal missteps and occasionally rambling responses during the debate have heightened concern.",

        "text": "This Is What the Twenty-fifth Amendment Was Designed For\nIn a live broadcast of \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d immediately after the Presidential debate last week, the comedian Jon Stewart joked about President Joe Biden\u2019s open-mouthed stare: \u201cA lot of people have resting Twenty-fifth Amendment face.\u201d A once obscure constitutional provision, the Twenty-fifth Amendment became familiar to the public during Donald Trump\u2019s Presidency, when there was constant chatter about his mental unfitness and incapacity. (I wrote about it for The New Yorker on five separate occasions.)\n\nThe Constitution allows a President who is \u201cunable to discharge the powers and duties of his office\u201d to step aside or be removed and have the Vice-President \u201cimmediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President.\u201d Soon after January 6, 2021, when a mob incited by Trump stormed the Capitol to disrupt the certification of Biden\u2019s win, Chuck Schumer, then the Senate Minority Leader, and Nancy Pelosi, then the Speaker of the House, said that Trump should be removed from office using the Twenty-fifth Amendment, with Schumer describing it as the most effective legal means of removing a President and saying that \u201cit can be done today.\u201d That did not happen. Now is really a good time for Democratic leaders to dust off their knowledge of the Amendment\u2014this time regarding their own party\u2019s President.\n\nThe widespread anxieties about Biden\u2019s age-related impairment have increased over time, only to be shushed by his allies. They became most plainly justified during his painful and prolonged public exposure on television during last week\u2019s debate. The fact that many prominent Democrats have yet to say the obvious and instead have told voters not to worry about one bad debate is a poignant national version of the denial that almost every family eventually goes through with respect to an aging patriarch or matriarch. This is clearly happening in Biden\u2019s own family, with his wife, Jill, and his son Hunter reportedly insisting that he continue his campaign, and with Hunter even said to have accompanied Biden to White House meetings. It is time for our leaders to realize that this is not in fact a family matter and take seriously their own constitutional responsibility to determine whether the President\u2014not the team around him\u2014has the capacity to govern.\n\nThe \u201cwill he or won\u2019t he\u201d speculation in the past few days has been about whether Biden will choose to step aside as the Democratic nominee in the Presidential race, which reflects a desire to leave the President to make the decision about whether he can beat Trump in November. This is misguided. First, it puts the cart before the horse: the initial question for any campaign should be whether the candidate has the ability to lead. Second, if Biden were to step aside as the nominee, we all know it would open up possibly catastrophic uncertainty about who the Democratic nominee will be, even if he were to indicate which candidate he preferred to take his place on the ticket. The chaotic process of quickly selecting a new nominee could consume Democrats and doom their chances in November. That makes it difficult for me to confidently wish for Biden to decide to step aside as the nominee\u2014and likely impossible for him, his family, and Democratic leaders to think it is the responsible thing to do at this point.\n\nBut there is a better path. Instead of making a choice between remaining on the ticket or stepping off of it, Biden should resign from the Presidency altogether as soon as possible. The Twenty-fifth Amendment says that in the case of the President\u2019s resignation, the Vice-President\u2014Kamala Harris\u2014becomes the President. (Harris would have to nominate a Vice-President, who would then take office upon being confirmed by both houses of Congress.) President Harris could then run as the incumbent\u2014a benefit to her candidacy that would also offer the stability we desperately need. We would not have to fret intensely about an open convention or anticipate a divisive and bruising fight over who the nominee will be. This allows an orderly transition\u2014in place of mayhem\u2014in which Biden cedes smoothly to Harris and sets the stage for a campaign season focussed on a version of the Biden-Harris Administration with Harris as its representative. By November, President Harris would already have had four months on the job. Biden and those who love him could campaign for her based on his Administration\u2019s record and accomplishments.\n\nIf Biden resigns soon, then there is little reason to discuss the ins and outs of the Twenty-fifth Amendment. If a permanent resignation seems too extreme for him to contemplate, the Amendment\u2019s Section Three provides a way for the President to cede the office to the Vice-President without the finality of a resignation. Biden can make \u201ca written declaration that he is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office,\u201d and Harris would become the acting President. That would still likely place Harris in the political position to immediately become the de-facto incumbent.\n\nBut if Biden resists either an outright resignation or a break for the rest of his term under the Twenty-fifth Amendment, then it would be time to look to Section Four of the Amendment, which covers removing the President involuntarily. The Vice-President and a majority of the Cabinet can declare that Biden \u201cis unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office,\u201d whereupon Harris would become the acting President. At that point, Biden could say that \u201cno inability exists\u201d and resume his office, but I can\u2019t imagine that he would do so after his Vice-President and Cabinet have taken such a step. (In that event, Harris and a majority of the Cabinet, or some \u201cother body as Congress may by law provide,\u201d could once again declare the President\u2019s inability, and he could be removed by a two-thirds vote in both houses.)\n\nI doubt it would ever have to get so far as involuntary removal. Indeed, the Twenty-fifth Amendment\u2019s removal mechanism is most useful right now for persuading Biden to leave the office voluntarily\u2014so that Harris can become the President for the remainder of the year. In 1974, a delegation from Congress went to the White House and told President Richard Nixon that he would be impeached if he did not resign, and he resigned the next day. Something similar needs to happen today, with Democratic leaders and Cabinet members talking to Biden about what they might be willing to do under the Twenty-fifth Amendment if he does not resign. This did not happen after President Woodrow Wilson had a stroke, in 1919; his wife Edith took over many of his duties until his second term ended, in 1921, and the American public was none the wiser. President Ronald Reagan began showing signs of Alzheimer\u2019s as early as three years into his first term, according to his son Ron\u2019s 2011 book, \u201cMy Father at 100.\u201d His family and staff managed to hide the symptoms from the public as long as he was in office. We should feel grateful that it is much harder to hide or credibly deny such impairment in a President today.",

        "text": "Libertarian party vice presidential candidate wants to be \u2018disruptor\u2019 in November election \u2022 Oklahoma Voice\nOKLAHOMA CITY \u2013 Although the Libertarian vice presidential candidate is not banking on a win, he is looking to be a \u201cdisruptor\u201d to November\u2019s election.\n\nMike ter Maat was picked to serve on the Libertarian presidential ticket in May, alongside Chase Oliver. They will face presumptive candidates former President Donald Trump, President Joe Biden and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.\n\nHe spoke with voters Tuesday night in Oklahoma City at a meet-and-greet.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s impossible for us to win the White House,\u201d ter Maat said. \u201cBut we recognize it\u2019s a long shot.\u201d\n\nKey points of the pair\u2019s platform include reshaping foreign policy by stopping aid, ending the Federal Reserve System and relinquishing government intervention into American lives as much as possible.\n\nTer Maat was a professional economist for 25 years before serving 11 years as a police officer.\n\nHe said his experience makes him qualified to tackle criminal justice reform and stop the war on drugs, which he said isn\u2019t aligned with American values.\n\nTer Maat previously ran an unsuccessful congressional campaign, garnering less than 1% of the vote in Florida\u2019s 20th district. Oliver has also run two unsuccessful congressional campaigns. In 2022, he caused a runoff in Georgia between Sen. Raphael Warnock and Herschel Walker, ter Maat said.\n\nThe Libertarian party has nominated a presidential candidate pair every election since 1972, according to ballotpedia.org. After turmoil at the Libertarian party\u2019s convention, Oliver and ter Maat were elected to be the face of the party in November\u2019s election.\n\nTer Maat said he doesn\u2019t view his candidacy as a spoiler.\n\n\u201cBut the real objective is to no longer allow the Republican and Democratic parties to just completely knee jerk, disregard our campaign, our philosophies, our candidates, our party, because that\u2019s the way it works now,\u201d ter Maat said.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the way Seth McKee, a political science professor at Oklahoma State University, sees it.\n\n\u201cMost of the time, if they do play much of a role, it is \u2018spoiler,\u2019 meaning they have no prayer of winning, but they can be pivotal in swinging the vote to one of the major candidates,\u201d McKee said.\n\nMcKee said third party candidates have the ability to get disenfranchised voters, who wouldn\u2019t otherwise vote, out to the polls.\n\nThis effect is less likely to have weight in Oklahoma, he said, which had all 77 counties vote for Trump in 2016 and 2020.\n\nRegistered Libertarians in Oklahoma make up less than 1% of voters, according to a January voter registration report.\n\nMcKee said registering with a third party is a \u201cdouble-edged sword.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a signal that they\u2019re upset with the two parties, but they\u2019re less likely to participate because they\u2019re upset with the two parties, so they undermine their own clout and influence by not being as participatory,\u201d McKee said.\n\nFor Chris Powell, state chair for the Libertarian party, the party\u2019s messaging needs to improve.\n\nDemocrats are \u201cbecoming an endangered species in rural areas,\u201d he said, which the party can capitalize on to reach those voters.\n\n\u201cIt just takes catching lightning in a bottle, a little bit, and people getting energized and getting on board,\u201d Powell said. \u201cThis election, as bad as the top of the ticket is for the two establishment parties, could be the catalyst for that.\u201d\n\nBeing a spoiler is not something David Greer is worried about.\n\nThe first elected Libertarian official in Oklahoma, Greer serves on the Dougherty City Council. Doughtery has 199 citizens, according to the 2020 census.\n\nGreer said he recognizes the smaller role the party currently plays, but that it holds an advantage with its candidate selection.\n\n\u201cWith elections like this, where the establishment parties aren\u2019t putting up good candidates because they don\u2019t have to, I think we\u2019re gonna get more looks our way and appear more appealing,\u201d Greer said.\n\nAfter Thursday\u2019s presidential debate on CNN, ter Maat said he thinks his and Oliver\u2019s odds are better heading into November.\n\nAlthough surprised by the nation\u2019s reaction to the debate, he said Biden\u2019s behavior is what he has observed for months.\n\nAs voters weigh their options, ter Maat said self-reflection is important.\n\n\u201cYou should vote for values in a candidate, in a ticket, that align with your own, and you should not be sending the signal to other parties and candidates that they\u2019re on the right track if you don\u2019t feel that they are.\u201d",

        "text": "No God, no big ads and no age debate: The UK election race is very different to America's\nBritain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, left, and U.S. President Joe Biden speak at the start of the meeting of the North Atlantic Council (NAC) during the NATO Summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, July 11, 2023. Paul Ellis | AP\n\nThe U.K. and U.S. have a lot in common \u2014 a shared language, history, democratic ideals and values. But when it comes to politics, us Brits do things very differently from our American friends. Those differences are plain to see as election campaigns ramp up in the U.K. and U.S., ahead of the British vote on July 4 and the U.S. ballot on Nov. 5. Of course, our political systems encompass different electoral procedures and processes, but there are other nuances to how the Brits and Americans do political races differently. Here are a handful of them:\n\n1) Campaigns\n\nBy the time a presidential election takes place in the United States, the electorate will have already endured months of seemingly endless electioneering \u2014 with the entire election campaign process from candidacies and the campaign trail to the actual presidential election and inauguration taking up to two years. In the U.K., the time frame between a prime minister calling a general election to the actual vote is just six weeks. American readers might, very reasonably, read that and weep.\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer boards his campaign 'battle bus' after holding a Q&A with students during a visit to Burton and South Derbyshire College in Burton-on-Trent, whilst campaigning for next month's General Election on July 4.

Stefan Rousseau - Pa Images | Pa Images | Getty Images\n\nWith such a tight window in which to win voters' support, the leaders of Britain's political parties dash about the U.K. on campaign \"battle buses\" as they try to visit as many constituencies as possible to persuade voters to elect the local party candidate as a member of Parliament (MP). The party that wins the most seats in the House of Commons (the British Parliament) usually forms the new government and its leader becomes prime minister. It sounds simple, and usually is, unless there's a \"hung parliament\" in which no political party wins a majority of seats. In that case, the largest party can either form a minority government or enter into a coalition government of two or more parties. Bobby Duffy, director of the Policy Institute at King's College London, told CNBC that there are many historical and structural differences between the countries when it comes to politics, and reasons why American campaigns are so much longer. \"The hugeness of the election in the U.S. is a function of the massive amounts of money at play to some degree. You do have to have these long periods of fundraising alongside campaigning and we just have completely different rules and structures around that.\"\n\n2) Election spending and ads\n\nMoney is certainly one of biggest differences between U.K. general elections and U.S. presidential elections. Stateside, billions of dollars can be fundraised and spent on campaign activities and political ads, far above that spent in the U.K. (after all, the parties in Britain only have six weeks in which to spend the money!). For a Brit, the money raised and spent by Republicans and Democrats during election campaigns is eye-watering. In April, the U.S. Federal Election Commission released data that showed that during the first 12 months of the 2024 election cycle (covering 2023), presidential candidates collected $374.9 million and disbursed $270.8 million, while political parties received $684.5 million and spent $595 million, and political action committees raised $3.7 billion and spent $3.1 billion, according to campaign finance reports filed with the commission. A number of political action committees, or PACs, raise money and make direct contributions to candidates' campaigns or parties. In the case of \"super PACs,\" committees raise and spend an unlimited amount of money in support of their preferred candidates, often funding large-scale ad campaigns.\n\nFormer U.S. President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump gestures during a campaign event in Philadelphia on June 22, 2024. Tom Brenner | Reuters\n\nIn the U.K., meanwhile, the Electoral Commission sets out strict rules on spending limits for political parties contesting the general election in Great Britain (made up of England, Wales and Scotland). In England, for example, the limit is whichever the greater is of \u00a31,458,440 ($1,845,098) or \u00a354,010 times the number of seats the party is contesting in each part of Britain. Parties can be fined, and often are, for breaching those limits. In the U.K., political advertising on TV and radio is not allowed, so U.K. voters are subjected to the somewhat quaint \"party political broadcasts\" during election campaigns. That's where parties are allocated broadcast slots, free of charge, on radio and TV channels in which they can set out their election pledges. The broadcasts are sporadic, however, and easy to miss, unlike the thousands of ads in the U.S.\n\n3) 'We don't do God'\n\nYou will never hear a British politician \u2014 at least not a mainstream one \u2014 mentioning God in a political speech or campaign. Ever. Religion, in general, is kept separate from politics in the U.K., a multifaith country but also one in which religious belief is declining, particularly among younger generations. Just under half (49%) of Britons surveyed in 2022 said they believed in God \u2014 down from three-quarters (75%) in 1981, according to a study by King's College London published last year. While it's common to hear U.S. politicians proclaim \"God bless America,\" jaws would drop in the U.K. if a British politician made such an expression of faith in a political speech. Political aides say the subject is better left alone.\n\nBritain's then-Prime Minister Tony Blair (R) and his official spokesperson Alastair Campbell, leave the Inverness Royal Academy after meeting schoolchildren there, in 2001. Ben Curtis - Pa Images | Pa Images | Getty Images\n\nAlastair Campbell, who served as the Labour Party's director of communications and strategy under former Prime Minister Tony Blair, reportedly interjected with the now famous phrase \"we don't do God,\" when Blair, then a member of the Church of England, was asked about his faith while in power. On another occasion, Blair was reportedly keen on ending a speech with the phrase \"God bless Britain\" but later said he was advised against it, noting that \"one of the civil servants said in a very po-faced way 'I just remind you prime minister, this is not America' in this very disapproving tone, so I gave up the idea.\" Blair converted to Catholicism on leaving office in 2007. An aversion to mixing politics and personal belief still runs deep in British public life, Dan Stevens, professor of politics at Exeter University, told CNBC, unlike in the U.S. \"They're just a much more religious society than we are. The U.K., along with much of Western Europe, is just so secular it's just not even something worth talking about. Whereas in America, although it is secularizing, particularly among younger people ... there is still this need for political candidates, including people like Donald Trump, to espouse some kind of religion to earn the electorate's trust.\"\n\n4) Age is just a number\n\nU.K. voters have been hearing a lot in the press about how U.S. election debates have focused on incumbent President Joe Biden's age. Indeed, British politicians look like whippersnappers when compared with the 81-year-old president and 78-year-old Republican candidate Trump.\n\nDemocratic Party presidential candidate U.S. President Joe Biden and Republican presidential candidate former U.S. President Donald Trump speak during a presidential debate in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., June 27, 2024 in a combination photo. Brian Snyder | Reuters\n\nIncumbent British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is a youngster in comparison, at a mere 44 years old while Keir Starmer, the leader of the Labour Party and, polls suggest, the man likely to become the next prime minister, is \"only\" 61. \"There are so much older candidates in the U.S.,\" the Policy Institute's Duffy told CNBC, describing it to a \"gerontocracy trend\" in which society is governed by old people. \"It's very different from around the world where we're actually seeing a decline in the age of world leaders.\" In the U.S., the age of the candidates reflects the decades it takes to build \"political capital and connections,\" Duffy said. With support for Biden shaken by his poor performance in a televised debate with Trump, it's that political capital and connections that appear to be keeping Biden's election campaign alive.\n\nAnother point of difference in British elections, and politics in general, is that \"morality issues\" are not prominent points of debate, dissent or divergence. Unlike the U.S., where the abortion debate, gun control and gay marriage are sources of contention, those debates are not hot topics in the U.K. where abortion is legal, gun ownership is rare and heavily restricted (critics would argue the U.K. has a knife crime problem instead), and gay marriage is (aside from among some members of the clergy) uncontested.\n\nAttendees hold large Pride flag at the 2023 LA Pride Parade on June 11, 2023 in Hollywood, California. (Photo by Rodin Eckenroth/Getty Images) Rodin Eckenroth | Getty Images\n\nSimilarly, \"identity politics\" and \"culture wars\" \u2014 the umbrella term for conflicts between often opposed political groupings with different cultural values and beliefs \u2014 are not so prominent in the U.K. But the U.K. does have our \"moments\" \u2014 the topics of immigration, transgender rights, the U.K.'s relationship with the European Union (yes, Brexit is still \"a thing\" eight years after a referendum on EU membership) and assisted dying are hot topics where divisions are evident among the British press and public. Still, such issues are seen as \"more of a personal rather than a party issue\" in the U.K., according to John Curtice, a top U.K. polling expert who has studied British social attitudes extensively. \"Moral issues of life and death are indeed taken out of our party politics, but other aspects of the argument between social liberals and social conservatives are not taken out, and it's become more important,\" he told CNBC.\n\n6) 'Absurd' diversions\n\nBritish political experts note that, unlike in the U.S., where broad political debates tend to remain the key focus, U.K. election campaigns can see more minor or fringe issues dominate the short election campaign. A betting scandal has erupted in Britain in recent weeks, for example, after several candidates for the Conservative Party, and a candidate for the opposing Labour Party, were found to have placed bets on the date of the general election before it was officially announced, and its outcome, leading to accusations of impropriety in public office. It's uncertain what amounts were staked, and those accused deny wrongdoing, though investigations have been launched by the U.K.'s gambling watchdog and the police.\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak (L) meets with a British D-Day veteran during the UK Ministry of Defence and the Royal British Legion's commemorative ceremony marking the 80th anniversary of the World War II \"D-Day\" Allied landings in Normandy, at the World War II British Normandy Memorial near the village of Ver-sur-Mer, which overlooks Gold Beach and Juno Beach in northwestern France, on June 6, 2024.

He told a Wisconsin radio station he made a \"mistake\" with his stumbling performance, but urged voters to instead judge him on his time in the White House. On Wednesday, as reports suggested he was weighing his future, he worked to calm senior Democrats including state governors and campaign staff. \u201cI'm the nominee of the Democratic Party. No one's pushing me out. I'm not leaving,\" he said in a call to the broader campaign, a source told BBC News. Mr Biden was joined on the call by Vice-President Kamala Harris, who reiterated her support. Speculation has mounted over whether she could replace the president as the party\u2019s candidate ahead of the November election. A fundraising email sent after the call by the Biden-Harris campaign was also bullish. \u201cLet me say this as clearly and simply as I can: I'm running,\u201d Mr Biden said. Can Biden be replaced as nominee? It's not easy\n\nThe names in the frame if Biden quits Questions have been swirling around whether the 81-year-old will continue with his campaign following a debate marked by verbal blanks and a weak voice. It sparked concern in Democratic circles around his fitness for office and his ability to win the election. Pressure on Mr Biden to drop out has only grown as more polls suggest his Republican rival\u2019s lead has widened. A New York Times poll conducted after the debate, which was published on Wednesday, suggested Trump was now holding his biggest lead yet at six points. And a separate poll published by the BBC\u2019s US partner CBS News suggested Trump has a three-point lead over Mr Biden in the crucial battleground states.\n\nName-calling and insults - key moments from Biden and Trump\u2019s debate\n\nThe damaging polling for Mr Biden has been compounded by some Democratic donors and lawmakers publicly calling on the president to stand aside. Among them are Ramesh Kapur, an Indian-American industrialist based in Massachusetts, who has organised fundraisers for Democrats since 1988. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for him to pass the torch,\u201d Mr Kapur told the BBC. \u201cI know he has the drive, but you can\u2019t fight Mother Nature.\u201d And two Democrats in Congress also called for a change at the top of the party\u2019s ticket. The second, Representative Raul Grijalva of Arizona, told the New York Times it was time for Democrats to \u201clook elsewhere\u201d. Despite this, the White House and the Biden campaign have vehemently denied reports he is actively weighing his future and say he is committed to defeating Trump for a second time on 5 November. The New York Times and CNN reported on Wednesday that Mr Biden had told an unnamed ally he was aware his re-election bid was in danger. His forthcoming appearances - including an ABC News interview and a Friday rally in Wisconsin - were hugely important to his campaign, he reportedly said.\n\nMore on the election\n\nA spokesperson rejected the reports as \u201cabsolutely false\u201d, shortly before White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said reports that he may drop out were untrue. Among the senior Democrats Mr Biden met on Wednesday was a group of 20 state governors from around the country, including California\u2019s Gavin Newsom and Michigan\u2019s Gretchen Whitmer. Both have been tipped as potential replacements if Mr Biden were to stand aside. \"The president has always had our backs, we\u2019re going to have his back as well,\" Maryland Governor Wes Moore told reporters after the meeting. CBS confirmed reports that Mr Biden told governors that he needs to get more sleep and curtail public events and meetings that stretch after 20:00, according to a participant in the meeting. Should Mr Biden step down, Ms Harris is still considered the most likely replacement. The 59-year-old has been hampered by poor approval ratings, but her support has increased among Democrats since the Biden-Trump debate. Amid the speculation, comments made by Trump indicated he could be switching his attention to attacking Ms Harris. In footage obtained by the Daily Beast - and shared online by Trump himself - he can be seen in a golf cart pouring scorn on Mr Biden, whom he describes as \"broken down\". He suggests that Ms Harris would be \"better\", though still \"pathetic\".\n\nEPA President Biden and Vice-President Harris presented a united front to Democrats on Wednesday (file image)",

        "text": "US Presidential Election 2024: Is Joe Biden planning not to contest the upcoming election?\nPolitical realities:\n\n\n\nBiden confident about his campaign:\n\n\n\nBiden\u2019s upcoming campaign:\n\n\n\nFAQs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(You can now subscribe to our\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel\n\nUS President Joe Biden is considering to end his campaign ahead of the US Presidential Election in 2024 and make way for another candidate from the Democratic Party . This is according to a report in The New York Times. It has been reported that the president is aware of the political realities and may want to step down. He has reportedly confided in private to some of his trusted aides. In public, he is brazening it out and refusing to step down. He has a series of political campaigns and a television interview planned during the weekend. The next few weeks will be critical for Biden as he tries to gain some lost territory.In the latest survey conducted by Siena College, Trump has a six-percentage point lead over Biden after the first presidential debate. Biden is believed to have told his aides that if the political situation remains the same and does not improve in the coming weeks, he may step down from the presidential race. Earlier before the debate, Trump had a marginal lead over Biden with a three-percentage point lead. This has now widened further.Many of the Democrats have called for Biden\u2019s replacement and it was earlier reported that some of the donors have given a two week grace period for Biden to recover from the loss and surge ahead in the national surveys.In an email to the donors, Biden acknowledged that the debate was particularly bad. However, he added that he is confident of getting re-elected and assured the donors and his supporters that the Democrats will recover in a short period of time. He said that he is running. This clarification came after news reports indicated that the president was stepping down and may not contest the upcoming presidential election.The coming weekend will be a busy time for Biden as he plans to launch a series of campaign related activities. Even before the weekend, the White House will be organizing a barbeque get together and fireworks to mark the American Independence Day on July 4. More than 1000 visitors have been invited to participate in this event.On Wednesday, he also met all the Democrat Governors and Congressmen and had a frank exchange of views on the current political campaign. This included some potential replacements including the Governor of California Gavin Newsom who have fully endorsed Biden\u2019s re-election bid.During the weekend, Biden will be campaigning in the two key swing states of Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. His interview with the ABC News will also be aired.In 1968, Lyndon B Johnson made a surprise announcement during a speech from the Oval Office saying that he will not be contesting the presidential election. He attributed this to the then Vietnam war. He said he had to focus on administrative and defense related issues rather than conduct an election campaign.This question assumes significance with Donald Trump who is seeking to re-enter the White House. Trump won the election in 2016 but lost the election in 2020. He is seeking to re-enter the White House in 2024. The only other candidate who has won the election in this manner is Grover Cleveland who served as the US President from 1884-1888. He lost the electoral college vote in 1888 and won the election in 1892.",

        "text": "This Fourth of July, it\u2019s hard to feel optimistic about the US. But I have hope | Margaret Sullivan\nIf you\u2019ve been paying even the slightest bit of attention, you know that the American Experiment took some gut punches over the last week.\n\nJoe Biden \u2013 long considered the best hope for preventing another disastrous Donald Trump term \u2013 had a shockingly bad debate performance, looking and sounding every minute of his 81 years.\n\nThe tainted supreme court then declared, in essence, that a president is above the law, at least when acting in an official capacity. And that came on top of other high court decisions that have blasted away at the foundations of democracy in the United States.\n\nAnd much of the mainstream news media continued their campaign of false equivalency \u2013 treating the president\u2019s age as a worse problem than Trump\u2019s criminality and authoritarian intentions.\n\nBut on this Fourth of July, I haven\u2019t given up hope that we will right ourselves. And I\u2019m far from alone.\n\nThere is encouraging news in every one of these troubled spheres \u2013 politics, justice and media.\n\nI asked one of my favorite thinkers, the author and scholar Ruth Ben-Ghiat, an expert in how democracies can wither under authoritarian rule, for some help. I talked to others, too, especially those who are protecting the vote, fostering good journalism and working for justice.\n\nHere\u2019s what Ben-Ghiat told me: \u201cPart of the reason for so much aggression from the GOP and the courts to take away our rights, including the right to free and fair elections, is because America is becoming more progressive, and Republicans cannot win without lies, threats and election interference, including assistance in that area from foreign powers.\u201d\n\nShe sees the US participating in \u201cthe global renaissance of mass nonviolent protest against authoritarianism\u201d and notes that, in 2017, we saw the biggest protest in the nation\u2019s history \u2013 the Women\u2019s March against Trump, which was then surpassed in 2020 by the Black Lives Matter protests, which involved more than 20 million people in multigenerational and multiracial demonstrations.\n\n\u201cThese mass protest movements had electoral consequences in the 2018 and 2022 midterm elections,\u201d she added, as many women, non-white and LGBTQ+ people were elected to office.\n\nBen-Ghiat is convinced that we are ripe for another round \u2013 and the stakes are higher than ever.\n\nOn the justice front, I\u2019m not suggesting that we somehow set aside the terrible and hugely consequential decision that gives a president \u2013 guess who in particular? \u2013 immunity for his official acts.\n\nBut at the same time, the courts, including the jury system, are often functioning admirably, if not flawlessly. Just over a month ago, Trump became the first former US president convicted of felonies. Trump allies who wanted to charge that the courts have been weaponized found it harder to make that argument less than two weeks later when Hunter Biden, too, was convicted in a jury trial.\n\nMainstream journalism, as noted, often disappoints. The moderators of the CNN debate clearly should have been empowered by their network bosses to challenge Trump\u2019s barrage of lies in real time. The stunning New York Times editorial calling for Biden to set aside his campaign for the good of the nation may have been well-reasoned, but it struck me as another example of targeting the president and letting Trump off the hook. To my knowledge, only the scrappy Philadelphia Inquirer has written a similar editorial about Trump.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Follow Margaret Sullivan Free newsletter Sign up to get email alerts every time Margaret Sullivan publishes a new column.

The media is baying for Biden\u2019s head, but \u2013 with some exceptions \u2013 seems mostly bemused by Trump or at least habituated to how dangerous he is.\n\nBut there\u2019s good news in journalism, too. Consider ProPublica\u2019s essential reporting on Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019s rotten ethics. Or the way many news outlets have revealed the threats of Project 2025 \u2013 the alarming and detailed plan by Trump allies to dismantle democratic norms should their leader win a second term.\n\nI\u2019m also heartened by young journalists who are making their way in a difficult career field.\n\n\u201cNo matter what problem we\u2019re talking about, good journalism is part of the solution,\u201d said Jelani Cobb, the dean of Columbia Journalism School (where I run a journalism ethics center). \u201cThe young journalists whom we have the privilege to work with here are some of the sharpest, most committed and talented that I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nTheir work \u201cwill be a ballast for democracy\u201d, Cobb told me, \u201ceven amid the giant challenges in front of us right now\u201d.\n\nMost of all, I\u2019m moved by the valiant efforts of many ordinary citizens. One friend, active in voter protection efforts, praised \u201call of the grassroots volunteers working to preserve democracy who I am sure will continue in all the ways possible if Trump wins\u201d. She mentioned the flood of small-dollar donations that followed Biden\u2019s debate debacle, and credited \u201cthe courageous judges, court personnel, jurors et al who are working, despite the risks to themselves, to see that justice is served in the cases against Trump\u201d.\n\nWill any of this matter when so much is going wrong and when the threats are so great? The screenwriter and former journalist David Simon offered a dour view this week: \u201cOur American experiment is so over.\u201d\n\nMore aligned with Ruth Ben-Ghiat\u2019s big-picture view and the others quoted here, I remain hopeful, if not optimistic about the future of the United States.\n\nOn 4 July, at least, let\u2019s remember that we\u2019ve come a long way, and the journey isn\u2019t yet complete.",

        "text": "Biden faces make-or-break stretch for his imperiled presidential campaign\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden on Thursday opened a critical stretch in his effort to salvage his imperiled reelection campaign, arguing the stakes extend far beyond his own political prospects to the future of the country\u2019s economy and democracy itself.\n\nThere is a growing sense that Biden may have just days to make a persuasive case that he is fit for office before Democratic support for him completely evaporates in the aftermath of his disastrous debate performance last week against Republican Donald Trump.\n\nWATCH: \u2018Look at the numbers\u2019: Democratic Rep. Doggett calls for Biden to drop out of race\n\nIn an interview with a Wisconsin radio station that aired Thursday, Biden said, \u201cThe stakes are really high. I know you know this. For democracy, for freedom \u2026 our economy, they\u2019re all on the line.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe president is the most powerful office in the world. But we need someone with wisdom and character.\u201d\n\nThe interview on the Earl Ingram Show on the Civic Media Radio Network, taped Wednesday, was the part of a media and public events blitz that the Democratic president and his staff have acknowledged as a make-or-break moment. Some financial backers were holding off or canceling upcoming fundraisers, according to a person familiar with the plans who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss private discussions.\n\nAfter hosting a July Fourth evening barbecue at the White House for military families, Biden is scheduled to campaign in Wisconsin on Friday and sit for an interview with ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos that will air as a prime-time special that night.\n\nHe plans to be in Philadelphia on Sunday and hold a full news conference during the NATO summit in Washington next week.\n\nIt is not a given that his campaign will survive even that long if he does not deliver a strong showing on ABC. Discussions that were once a whisper around who should step into his place should he bow out are growing louder.\n\nFor now, Biden is not ready to walk away and he has communicated that in conversations with Democratic governors, close allies and staffers from his campaign.\n\nBut time is short for a possible change. The Democratic National Committee announced weeks ago that it would hold a virtual roll call for a formal nomination before the party\u2019s national convention, which begins Aug. 19.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud to be running for reelection as a president who\u2019s made his promises and I\u2019ve kept them,\u201d Biden said in the radio interview.\n\n\u201cI had a bad night. A bad night. I screwed up,\u201d he said of the debate, where he gave halting and convoluted answers.\n\n\u201cBut 90 minutes on stage does not erase what I\u2019ve done for 3 1/2 years,\u201d he said in a different interview, with Philadelphia-area WURD Radio.\n\nIn his private conversations, Biden has focused on how to reverse the trajectory from his rocky debate and has emphasized the critical nature of this year\u2019s presidential election.\n\nDuring one call, when asked what would happen if his efforts to course correct do not work, Biden stressed that he understood how important the race is and that he would put the country first, according to a person who spoke directly with the president. The person was granted anonymity to discuss private conversations.\n\nBiden met for more than hour at the White House on Wednesday night, in person and virtually, with more than 20 Democratic governors. Afterward they described the conversation as \u201ccandid\u201d and said they were standing behind Biden despite being concerned about a Trump victory in November.\n\nDuring that meeting, Biden told leaders that he had been checked out by his doctor following his debate performance, according to two people familiar with the talks who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the private conversation. A few hours earlier, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre had said Biden had not been examined by the doctor.\n\nThe White House has blamed Biden\u2019s debate performance, where he appeared pale and his raspy voice trailed off at times, on a cold. Biden also said he had jet lag following back-to-back foreign trips that ended 12 days earlier.\n\nBiden\u2019s staff has resisted repeated calls to release more robust medical records for the 81-year-old president. After his last full physical in February, his doctor declared him fit for duty.\n\nTwo Democratic lawmakers have publicly called for Biden to drop out of the race. Most Democratic lawmakers, though, are taking a wait-and-see approach, holding out for a better idea of how the situation plays out through new polling and the interview. That\u2019s according to Democratic lawmakers who requested anonymity to speak bluntly about the president.\n\nSome have suggested Vice President Kamala Harris is emerging as the favorite to replace Biden if he were to withdraw. Those involved in private discussions acknowledge that Govs. Gavin Newsom of California and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan remain viable alternatives. But for some insiders, Harris is viewed as the best prospect to quickly unify the party and avoid a messy and divisive convention fight.\n\nTrump was seen on video declaring that Harris would be his new rival, saying, \u201cshe\u2019s so pathetic.\u201d It was unclear when he made the comments, which were posted on his social media account.\n\nEven as other Democratic allies have remained quiet since the debate, there is a growing private frustration about the Biden campaign\u2019s response at a crucial moment in the campaign \u2014 particularly in Biden waiting several days to do direct damage control with senior members of his own party.\n\nAssociated Press Writers Seung Min Kim, Lisa Mascaro and Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Where Biden\u2019s potential Democratic replacements stand on the Gaza war\nAs the US president faces calls to drop out of the race, Al Jazeera looks at who could take his place and what they have said about Gaza.\n\nWashington, DC \u2013 The political storm unleashed by last week\u2019s presidential debate in the United States is still raging despite the White House\u2019s assurances that President Joe Biden is not quitting the race.\n\nThe 81-year-old president\u2019s disastrous performance against his predecessor Donald Trump has fuelled questions about his viability as a candidate, if not his fitness for office. During the debate, observers noted Biden regularly lost his train of thought and appeared exhausted or confused.\n\nThat has spurred pressure for Biden to drop out and make room for a different candidate to represent the Democratic Party, as the presidential election approaches in November.\n\nMany of Biden\u2019s potential replacements, however, have voiced support for him, but that has done little to quiet speculation about the president\u2019s future.\n\nBefore the debate, Biden faced growing discontent among large segments of the Democratic base over his \u201cironclad\u201d support for Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, which has killed more than 38,000 Palestinians and sparked accusations of genocide.\n\nSo if a new Democratic candidate is nominated, repairing the fractures the war has caused in the party may be a top priority: Key demographics including young voters, progressives, Arabs and Muslims have all signalled discontent over the Gaza war.\n\nHere, Al Jazeera looks at what Biden\u2019s potential alternatives have said about the conflict.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris\n\nShould Biden drop out, Harris would be the frontrunner to replace him at the top of the Democratic ticket.\n\nA former senator representing California, Harris is the daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica. She ran unsuccessfully for president in 2020.\n\nAs vice president, Harris represents the Biden administration, which has unflinchingly supported the war on Gaza. Still, she was one of the first senior administration officials to use the word \u201cceasefire\u201d while calling for a truce in Gaza.\n\n\u201cGiven the immense scale of suffering in Gaza, there must be an immediate ceasefire for at least the next six weeks,\u201d Harris said in March.\n\nAround that time, NBC News \u2014 citing anonymous officials \u2014 reported that Harris would have taken a more forceful stance against the war if given the chance by the White House.\n\n\u201cThis is Biden\u2019s war. This is Biden\u2019s failure,\u201d one source said. \u201cI think she would have asked for a ceasefire a long time ago.\u201d\n\nPublicly, Harris has stressed that she is in complete alignment with Biden.\n\nThe vice president has been a fervent backer of Israel throughout her political career. In 2017, the first measure she co-sponsored as a senator was to condemn a United Nations Security Council resolution that denounced Israel\u2019s illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank.\n\nLater that year, she told the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) that she has a deep connection to Israel.\n\n\u201cHaving grown up in the [San Francisco] Bay Area, I fondly remember those Jewish National Fund boxes that we would use to collect donations to plant trees for Israel,\u201d Harris told an AIPAC conference.\n\nMichigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer\n\nAlmost immediately after last week\u2019s debate, commentators started floating the name of Whitmer as a possible replacement for Biden.\n\nA popular politician from a key swing state, Whitmer gained national prominence in 2020 when she clashed with then-President Trump over COVID-19 pandemic policies. She cruised to re-election two years later.\n\nAs governor, Whitmer rarely deals with foreign policy. But she has voiced support for Israel on several occasions.\n\n\u201cWe here in Michigan condemn this vile act of terrorism,\u201d she said during an event at a synagogue days after Hamas\u2019s October 7 attack in Israel. \u201cWe stand with Israel. And Israel has a right to defend itself.\u201d\n\nThe gathering saw Michigan elected officials hold hands as they sang and danced in support of Israel \u2014 a gesture that many in the state\u2019s large Arab community found offensive.\n\nIn recent months, Whitmer has also expressed sympathy for the loss of life in Gaza, but she declined to say whether the spiralling death toll among Palestinians would amount to a genocide.\n\n\u201cI am not going to weigh in where I know that a lot of these terms are used to inflame and divide us,\u201d she told NBC News earlier this year.\n\nIn April, Whitmer was asked by CNN whether she supports a permanent ceasefire in Gaza; she skirted the question.\n\n\u201cI believe that the hostages need to be released and that the violence needs to stop, and we need to really talk about rebuilding Gaza and supporting the Palestinians,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile campaigning for governor in 2018, Whitmer said she \u201cstrongly\u201d supports a Michigan law that penalises companies that boycott Israel.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom\n\nSince beating a recall effort in 2021, Newsom has been seen as a rising star in Democratic politics.\n\nA vocal defender of the Biden agenda, the former San Francisco mayor has acted as a surrogate for the president\u2019s campaign, making appearances in the media and at last week\u2019s debate.\n\nLike other US officials, Newsom strongly condemned the October 7 attack and travelled to Israel last year, where he expressed uncompromising support for the country.\n\n\u201cDespite the horror, what I saw and heard from the people of Israel was a profound sense of resilience. A commitment to community and common purpose, especially in these most difficult of times,\u201d he said in a statement after his trip on October 20. \u201cThat\u2019s the Israeli spirit. And it\u2019s also the California spirit.\u201d\n\nIsrael had killed nearly 4,400 Palestinians in Gaza by then \u2014 about four times the number of Israelis killed by Hamas on October 7.\n\nIn March, Newsom called for a ceasefire in Gaza in a letter addressed to California\u2019s Muslim, Arab and Palestinian communities.\n\n\u201cI condemn the ongoing and horrific loss of innocent civilian life in Gaza,\u201d he said at that time.\n\n\u201cI support President Biden\u2019s call for an immediate ceasefire as part of a deal to secure desperately needed relief for Gazan civilians and the release of hostages. I also unequivocally denounce Hamas\u2019s terrorist attack against Israel.\u201d\n\nPennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro\n\nWhile he may not have the national name recognition that his fellow governors Newsom and Whitmer enjoy, Shapiro is considered one of the top candidates to potentially replace Biden.\n\nThe governor, who previously served as Pennsylvania\u2019s attorney general, comfortably won his election in the Mid-Atlantic swing state in 2022. Since taking office, he has had positive approval ratings.\n\nWith regards to the war in Gaza, Shapiro has been a staunch supporter of Israel.\n\n\u201cThe whataboutism used by some to justify Hamas\u2019s unprovoked actions is ignorant and wrong,\u201d he said last year. \u201cThere is no moral equivalency here. Israel has a right to defend itself.\u201d\n\nShapiro has also been outspoken in denouncing what he describes as anti-Semitism by protesters who oppose the war in Gaza.\n\nIn April, he likened pro-Palestinian student protesters to the Ku Klux Klan. The campus protests, however, have been largely peaceful, and student leaders say accusations of anti-Semitism misrepresent their aim: to encourage their universities to divest from Israeli companies linked to the country\u2019s human rights abuses.\n\n\u201cWe have to query whether or not we would tolerate this if this were people dressed up in KKK outfits or KKK regalia making comments about people who are African American in our communities,\u201d Shapiro told CNN.\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg\n\nButtigieg mounted an unlikely presidential campaign in 2020 despite his thin resume, having only served as the mayor of a college town in Indiana. Nevertheless, he performed well in the early primaries before dropping out and endorsing Biden.\n\nIn 2021, he became the first openly gay cabinet secretary after the US Senate confirmed him to lead the Department of Transportation. But he has faced criticism over his response to several crises: There have been mass delays in civilian aviation, as well as a 2023 train derailment that caused a chemical spill in Ohio.\n\nBut liberal commentators describe him as an effective communicator who can push back against Republican arguments.\n\nIn a rare comment on the Gaza conflict earlier this year, Buttigieg suggested that he understands why many people voted \u201cuncommitted\u201d in the Michigan Democratic primaries to protest Biden\u2019s support for the war.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, I get it, and nobody can look at what is happening there and feel good,\u201d he told the Pod Save America podcast in February.\n\n\u201cThe other thing I\u2019ll say is that, right now, negotiations are under way to make sure that two things happen: an end to the killing and the return of the hostages.\u201d\n\nDuring his presidential run, Buttigieg expressed support for Israel.\n\nIn 2019, he also said the US should not \u201cfoot the bill\u201d for the possible annexation of the occupied West Bank by Israel.\n\nBut months later, he appeared to change his position. Asked whether he would pledge to place conditions on aid to Israel to prevent annexation, he said: \u201cIf you\u2019re asking me to commit to withdrawing American support for Israel, the answer is no.\u201d",

        "text": "US Presidential Election 2024: Joe Biden tells Democratic Governors about health check-up after debate\nAmid rising concerns over Joe Biden's health issues and his re-election bid after disaster in the first presidential debate against Donald Trump, the POTUS on Wednesday made a major disclosure about his medical check-up to over 20 Democratic governors.\n\nThe admission comes amid growing talk among Democrats that Biden should drop out of the race.\n\nAccording to Politico, Biden, 81, informed governors in a private meeting that he underwent a medical check-up after last week\u2019s debate.\n\nAlso Read | Sudden return of the Trump trade sends Treasury yields reeling\n\nThe report stated that Biden was asked about his physical condition by one of the governors, and the president mentioned that he had a check-up, asserting that he remains in good health.\n\nHowever, the report quoting people with knowledge of the discussion stated that the check-up was done by a White House physician due to lingering symptoms from his cold and did not include any major tests.\n\nPress secretary Karine Jean-Pierre sidestepped direct questions from reporters who asked if he\u2019d been examined since the debate, reported Politico.\n\nAlso Read | Joe Biden to continue to run for Democrats in the 2024 Presidential race\n\n\u201cThe president has regular annual physicals that we release in a thorough report. We\u2019re going to continue to do that,\u201d she added.\n\nMeanwhile, the Democratic governors of New York, Minnesota and Maryland said they would support President Joe Biden's re-election bid.\n\n\"The president has always had our backs. We're going to have his back as well,\" said Maryland Governor Wes Moore after a meeting with Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, reported Reuters.\n\nAlso Read | Prisoner feels for his liberator\u2026, Ramaswamy on democrats likely to drop Biden\n\nMoore said there was clearly work to do before the Nov. 5 election, but Biden had made it clear he would stay in the race.\n\n\"The president ... he's our nominee. The president is our party leader,\" Moore added.\n\nNew York Governor Kathy Hochul said she felt confident after the meeting and all the governors pledged their support to Biden.",

        "text": "Would Kamala Harris be a stronger candidate than Biden?\nOn Thursday, June 27, President Joe Biden had one of the worst debates for an incumbent president in recent memory. According to a 538/Ipsos poll conducted after the debate using Ipsos\u2019s KnowledgePanel, the average debate watcher thought the president did \u201cpoor\u201d (on a scale from \u201cterrible\u201d to \u201cexcellent\u201d), and only 21 percent thought he performed best in the debate. By contrast, although former President Donald Trump turned in just an \u201cabout average\u201d performance that included numerous lies, 60 percent of debate watchers told 538/Ipsos they thought he performed the best. And according to 538\u2019s average, Trump\u2019s margin in national polls has increased by 2 percentage points since the debate.\n\nIn the aftermath of Biden\u2019s performance, the president has faced a barrage of calls to drop out of the presidential race to make way for a Democrat with a better chance of defeating Trump. Following a slew of articles written by its op-ed columnists, for example, The New York Times editorial board wrote, \u201cThe greatest public service Mr. Biden can now perform is to announce that he will not continue to run for re-election.\u201d Even some elected Democrats have taken the extraordinary step of publicly suggesting he should step aside, with Rep. Lloyd Doggett writing on Tuesday, \u201cToo much is at stake to risk a Trump victory.\u201d\n\nIf Biden were to step aside, Vice President Kamala Harris is the most likely choice to replace him as the Democratic nominee \u2014 not necessarily because she is the best pick (this is impossible to test) but purely by virtue of her being first in line to the presidency. The million-dollar question, then, is whether Democrats would be better off with Harris as their nominee than with Biden.\n\nThat\u2019s ultimately an unanswerable question, given the unprecedented and hypothetical nature of such a switcheroo, but we can attempt to quantify Harris\u2019s odds of winning based on the (limited, imperfect) information we do have. So, as a thought experiment, we ran two different versions of the 538 presidential forecast with Harris as the Democratic nominee instead of Biden.\n\n538\u2019s election forecast, Harris-Trump edition\n\nLet\u2019s get one caveat out of the way: We don\u2019t have that many public polls testing Harris against Trump. From April 1 through July 2, just over a dozen polls asked about this alternative matchup. But we do have polls from all the major swing states, thanks largely to tracking from Morning Consult, and we have enough national surveys to calculate a Harris-versus-Trump national polling average \u2014 and thus to forecast how she would perform in states without any polls.\n\nFor the most part, national polls have shown Harris doing about the same as Biden in head-to-head polls against Trump. In a March Fox News poll for example, Trump led Harris by 6 points and Biden by 5 points (well within the survey\u2019s margin of error). And as recently as June 28, a Data for Progress poll showed the president and vice president each losing to Trump by 3 points (also within the margin of error). That said, a June 28-30 CNN/SSRS poll found Harris losing to Trump by only 2 points while Biden was trailing by 6. This was also within the margin of error but was nonetheless a bigger gap and could mark the beginning of a shift for Harris.\n\nWhen we plug all these polls into a polls-only version of the 538 forecasting model \u2014 which jettisons the economic and political priors our full model uses, giving us an apples-to-apples comparison between candidates \u2014 Harris has a slightly higher chance of winning the Electoral College than Biden, but it\u2019s not a significant difference: 38-in-100 versus 35-in-100. On a state-by-state level, Biden looks stronger than Harris in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, while Harris\u2019s odds are higher than Biden\u2019s in Nevada.\n\nHarris also does slightly better than Biden in our forecast of the national popular vote. The model forecasts that Trump would outpace Harris nationally by 1.5 points, while he would outrun Biden by 2.1 points. However, this could be an artifact of our model not having any Harris-versus-Trump polls that include independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who tends to take slightly more votes away from Democrats than Republicans when included in a poll.\n\nHowever, Harris\u2019s popular-vote edge is almost entirely negated by the bigger Electoral College bias against her. In our polls-only forecast pairing Biden against Trump, the Democratic candidate needs to win the popular vote by just 1.1 points to win the presidency. That\u2019s thanks to Biden doing better in Pennsylvania, the likeliest tipping-point state in our model. Harris, by contrast, would need to win the popular vote by 3.5-4 points to win Pennsylvania and, with it, the Electoral College.\n\nHowever, whether Harris would truly be a stronger candidate than Biden also depends on information besides the polls. In our full forecast model \u2014 which includes a variety of non-polling economic and political variables, which we call the \u201cfundamentals\u201d \u2014 Harris does much worse than Biden across the board. Whereas Biden has a 48-in-100 chance to win the Electoral College, Harris has only a 31-in-100 chance.\n\nThis is thanks in large part to the boost our model confers on Biden as the incumbent president, which is worth an extra point for Biden over Harris in our fundamentals-only forecast of the national popular vote. However, one factor our model does not consider is whether presidents\u2019 approval rating and economic growth impact incumbents running for reelection more than non-incumbents running from the same party, and that may actually push Harris\u2019s numbers over Biden\u2019s. In other words, your mileage may vary depending on how much you believe that Biden should get a boost because he\u2019s the sitting president. There is no objectively correct answer here; one of the reasons election forecasting is hard is that it requires judgment calls like these.\n\nSometimes, it makes sense to bet on uncertainty\n\nBiden\u2019s core problem may not be captured in current polls, however. As his critics said after the debate, concerns about age and competency do not go away with time; in fact, they tend to get worse. Our forecast for Biden today depends on many known knowns and known unknowns, and, unfortunately for Democrats, the known downsides for Biden currently outweigh the known upsides. Another way of saying this is that Biden\u2019s chief risk is a \u201chard\u201d risk (as opposed to a soft one) \u2014 a product of an immutable trait that voters are unlikely to overlook by November.\n\nReplacing Biden with Harris, by contrast, would introduce more uncertainty into the election; in other words, Democrats would be betting that her \u201csoft\u201d risks aren\u2019t as bad as Biden\u2019s. For example, Harris had one of the most left-leaning voting records during her time in the U.S. Senate, which could hurt her among moderate voters. Yet Biden already does poorly with moderates \u2014 and at current levels of political polarization, a cross-cutting issue like Biden\u2019s age may make more of a difference with swing voters, anyway, than any narrow disagreements about policy.\n\nAt the end of the day, any decisions about whom the Democratic Party nominates for president will \u2014 or should \u2014 take more than just the polls into account. Right now, there is a lot of uncertainty around the alternatives for Biden. We have few polls for Harris, for example, and other alternatives are less well known and have not been vetted at the level a president or vice president is scrutinized at (just ask South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem). Until recently, that uncertainty was enough to hold calls for a new Democratic nominee at bay. But just as uncertainty creates more downside for a party, it also creates more upside. Given what Democrats have now realized about Biden, they may be willing to take that risk.",

        "text": "Message for U.S. Citizens \u2013 Voting\nTo vote in the November 2024 election, U.S. citizens overseas need to have completed a Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) in 2024. Whether you are a first-time voter or have already received ballots and voted absentee in past elections, you must complete an FPCA each calendar year to ensure you can participate in elections as an overseas absentee voter.\n\nU.S. election ballots can be sent to the U.S. by the Consular Section on your behalf. Please drop off your unsealed ballot, addressed to your local election office, at the Consular Section any non-holiday Monday or Wednesday at 2:00pm. You do not need an appointment to drop off your ballot. You can only seal your envelope at the embassy.\n\nPlease submit your ballot well in advance of the election. Mail may take up to four weeks to reach its destination. U.S. citizens have the option to send the ballot via international courier services such as DHL or FedEx if you cannot submit your ballot before that timeline. Normal transit time for mail from Jordan to the United States is 10-14 days.\n\nEven if you have never voted while overseas before, the process is simple:\n\n1. Request your ballot. Complete a new Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) . You must complete a new FPCA after January 1, 2024, to ensure you receive your ballot for the 2024 elections. Submitting the FPCA allows you to request absentee ballots for all elections for federal offices (President, U.S. Senate, and U.S. House of Representatives) including primaries and special elections during the calendar year in which it is submitted. All local election officials in all U.S. states and territories accept the FPCA.\n\nYou can complete the FPCA online at FVAP.gov . The online voting assistant will ask you questions specific to your state. We encourage you to request your blank ballots be delivered electronically (by email, internet download, or fax, depending on your state). Include your email address on your FPCA to take advantage of the electronic ballot delivery option. Return the FPCA per the instructions on the website. The online voting assistant will tell you if your state allows the FPCA to be returned electronically or if you must submit a paper copy with original ink signature. If you must return a paper version, please follow the same instructions below for returning your ballot.\n\n2. Receive and complete your ballot. States are required to send out ballots 45 days before a regular election for federal office and generally send ballots at least 30 days before primary elections. For most states, you can confirm your registration and ballot delivery online .\n\n3. Return your completed ballot. While some states allow you to return your completed ballot electronically, others do not. If your state requires you to return paper voting forms or ballots to local election officials, you can do so free of charge at the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate. Place your ballot in a postage-paid return envelope, or in an envelope bearing sufficient domestic U.S. postage, and address it to the relevant local election officials. Do not seal the envelope until you deliver it to the embassy.\n\nResearch candidates and issues. Please see the FVAP links page for resources you can use to research candidates and issues. FVAP regularly sends information about election dates and deadlines through their Voting Alerts. Email vote@fvap.gov to subscribe or follow FVAP on Facebook or Twitter .\n\nLearn more at the Federal Voting Assistance Program\u2019s (FVAP) website, FVAP.gov . If you have any questions about the process of voting while overseas, please visit the Learn more at the Federal Voting Assistance Program\u2019s (FVAP) website, FVAP.gov . If you have any questions about the process of voting while overseas, please visit the Embassy Amman website .\n\nRemember, your vote counts!\n\nU.S. Embassy Amman\n\nAmerican Citizens Services Unit",

        "text": "Joe Biden defiantly vows to stay in US presidential race\nJoe Biden has defiantly vowed to keep running for re-election after rejecting pressure from within the Democratic Party to withdraw after a disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump.\n\n\"Let me say this as clearly as I possibly can, as simply and straightforward as I can: I am running,\" the president said, according to a top aide who posted his comment on X.\n\n\"I'm not leaving. I'm in this race to the end, and we're going to win,\" he added, NBC News reported, citing a campaign official on the call.\n\nRead more: The key moments in the first US presidential election debate\n\nOn the call, Mr Biden also called for his party to unify, telling them \"when Democrats unite, we will always win, just as we beat Donald Trump in 2020, we're going to beat him again in 2024\".\n\nIt comes after The New York Times reported the 81-year-old US president had told an ally he was weighing up whether to run against Mr Trump in November's US election.\n\nOn Tuesday Mr Biden said he \"nearly fell asleep\" during last week's first presidential debate, during which commentators widely said he performed poorly.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, which called for President Biden to step aside after the debate, an anonymous \"key ally\" of the president said: \"He knows if he has two more events like that, we're in a different place\" by the weekend.\n\nThey emphasised the president is still fighting for re-election but he understands his next few appearances are pivotal.\n\nAnother anonymous adviser told the New York Times the president was \"well aware of the political challenge he faces\".\n\nAfter the report was published, White House spokesperson Andrew Bates wrote on social media: \"This claim is absolutely false.\"\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:49 US voters react to Biden debate\n\nMr Biden put his performance down to travel exhaustion after going \"around the world a couple of times\" shortly before the debate.\n\nThe US president admitted he \"wasn't very smart\" for having travelled extensively in the weeks leading up to the first TV debate of the election campaign in Atlanta.\n\nHis performance was such that friends and foes alike have told him to quit the race for the White House.\n\nBiden's response so far looks 'more like frailty than fighter' James Matthews US correspondent @jamesmatthewsky Among the screaming headlines is the line that will scream loudest to Joe Biden, Democrats and those deciding his future. The media company \u201cPuck\u201d reports that Democratic polling shows he\u2019s losing support in key battleground states in the wake of the TV debate. Places that were in his pocket, like New Hampshire, Virginia and New Mexico are now in play. Also, Biden is shown as trailing behind other alternative party candidates, including vice-president Kamala Harris, in hypothetical races against Donald Trump. More than anything, it is the voter\u2019s voice that will dictate Democratic choices about their leader. These early rumblings won\u2019t go unheard and, if amplified in the coming days, they will shift the gears in the drive for change. The race against Donald Trump has always been close but Democrats have taken heart from a Biden trajectory that showed signs of arcing upwards. Now the signs say something else. A sense of crisis around the president has become increasingly embedded in the Democratic party in the days since the stage showdown with Donald Trump. Many are as angry about the response to the debate as the debate itself and the sentiment is shared among party members, elected officials and some donors. Their concern is that their man has had nearly a week to confound concerns around his well-being and has, seemingly, ignored the political necessity to do so. There have been public appearances but the president has been stage-managed to within an inch of his life. He hasn\u2019t answered a single question from a journalist and has delivered only pre-prepared statements, read from autocue. It\u2019s the look of an insulated, tele-prompted president and it looks more like frailty than fighter. It\u2019s infuriating a party looking for reassurance about their president\u2019s health and for his recognition that it needs delivered, urgently.\n\nMr Biden told supporters at a campaign event in Virginia on Tuesday: \"I decided to travel around the world a couple times, going through around 100 time zones.\"\n\nFollow Sky News on WhatsApp Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky News Tap here\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nHe added he \"didn't listen\" to his staff, \"came back and nearly fell asleep on stage\".\n\n\"That's no excuse but it is an explanation,\" he added while admitting: \"I didn't have my best night.\"",

        "text": "Supreme Court Grants Trump, Future Presidents a Blank Check to Break the Law\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision to grant presidents immunity from prosecution for criminal acts committed while in office not only gives Donald Trump a free pass for his past crimes, but sets a dangerous precedent for all future presidents. Before Trump, no one had even argued that presidents are absolutely immune from criminal liability after they leave office. Indeed, every president \u2013 including Trump himself \u2013 assumed the opposite. In his impeachment trial Trump\u2019s lawyers argued against impeachment by conceding that an acquittal would not be the end of potential accountability, because he could be criminally prosecuted after he left office. That concession was in line with all prior presidents\u2019 acceptance that the United States is a place where all citizens, including the president, are equal under the law. No more. In Trump v. United States, the court\u2019s Republican-appointed justices \u2014 including the three Trump appointees \u2014 announced a brand new constitutional immunity from criminal liability for presidents\u2019 \u201cofficial acts,\u201d or anything a president may do using the powers of the office. The court\u2019s decision ensures that future presidents \u2014 including Trump himself should he win reelection in November \u2014 will know that they can escape criminal accountability for blatantly criminal acts, no matter how corrupt. Even acts that strike at the heart of our democracy, like resisting the peaceful transition of power, could not be prosecuted. The court tried to cast its opinion as restrained, emphasizing that it rejected former President Trump\u2019s most extreme claim: that presidents can only be prosecuted for crimes for which they had already been impeached. But as Justice Sonia Sotomayor pointed out in a powerful dissent, there is nothing measured about the opinion or its consequences. The court grants absolute immunity against criminal prosecution for any of a president\u2019s \u201ccore\u201d executive acts, which the court went on to define as including any use of the Justice Department\u2014an ostensibly and traditionally independent agency\u2013for criminal investigation. And it grants \u201cpresumptive\u201d immunity for any acts within the \u201couter perimeter of his official responsibility.\u201d While the latter immunity is in theory rebuttable, the court set such a high standard for rebutting it that it may be effectively absolute as well.\n\nThe court did hold that a president can be prosecuted for unofficial, purely private acts, a proposition even Trump did not dispute. But the court\u2019s conception of official acts is strikingly broad. Worse, the court also held that official acts cannot even be used as evidence to support a crime committed in the president\u2019s personal capacity, making it even more difficult for prosecutors to indict a president even for purely private criminal acts. The court purports to leave much of the work of hashing out the details in Trump\u2019s case to lower courts. But the standards it announced will make holding any president criminally accountable extraordinarily difficult. The immediate consequence of the decision is that it sends the current federal prosecution of former President Trump for interfering in the 2020 election into disarray. True, that prosecution is not yet dead. Formally, the Supreme Court only conclusively disqualified one set of allegations \u2014 those involving Trump\u2019s communications to the Department of Justice \u2014 from the indictment. But as a practical matter, the fact-laden inquiry in which the district court must now engage, and any appeals thereto, will take many months if not years to resolve \u2014 all before any trial can commence. In addition, President Trump has already moved to wipe out his criminal conviction in New York State. As Justice Robert Jackson warned in his dissent in the notorious Korematsu case upholding the federal government\u2019s internment of Japanese Americans, the court\u2019s opinion sits like a loaded weapon for future presidents, who can now avoid criminal liability for all manner of criminal ends so long as they do so through arguably \u201cofficial\u201d authorities. As Justice Sotomayor wrote in her dissent:\n\nThe President of the United States is the most powerful person in the country, and possibly the world. When he uses his official powers in any way, under the majority\u2019s reasoning, he now will be insulated from criminal prosecution. Orders the Navy\u2019s Seal Team 6 to assassinate a political rival? Immune. Organizes a military coup to hold onto power? Immune. Takes a bribe in exchange for a pardon? Immune. Immune, immune, immune.\n\nIf former President Trump manages to win November\u2019s election, it does not take much imagination to see just what kinds of retribution, or worse, the court has now greenlighted him to pursue against his political enemies. But it\u2019s important to remember that while this decision removes the possibility of criminal accountability, other forms of accountability remain. As long as this misguided decision remains the law, we must fight presidential abuses of power in other ways. In particular, we must resist encroachments on our rights and liberties, criminal or otherwise, before they happen \u2014 through civil lawsuits, the ballot box, and in the halls of power across the country. During the Trump administration, we filed more than 400 legal actions to defend constitutional rights and liberties from his administration\u2019s unprecedented assaults \u2014 and often succeeded in halting illegal acts. If he is elected again, we will be ready to do the same. Already our teams have drafted our response to the civil liberties and civil rights abuses outlined in Trump\u2019s transition project, and we promise to challenge any acts \u2013 official or not \u2013 that violate the Constitution. The threat of criminal prosecution is an important incentive to keep presidents from breaking the law. It\u2019s largely gone now thanks to the Supreme Court. But it is only one form of accountability and constraint \u2014 one that, we should remember, had never been resorted to in the past. As they always have done, the courts can still enjoin illegal presidential behavior. Congress has important powers of oversight, the purse, and lawmaking that can check even a rogue president. And perhaps most important, by voting like our rights depend on it, we can all help ensure that future presidents will leave the court\u2019s loaded gun in its holster.",

        "text": "Critics say Iran presidential election runoff not competitive despite uncertainty about likely victor\nAs Iran stages a presidential election runoff on Friday, its critics say the West should not interpret uncertainty about the likely victor as an indication of a democratic contest between two competing loyalists of the Islamic republic\u2019s supreme leader.\n\nFriday\u2019s vote pits ultraconservative former Iranian nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili against the relatively moderate former Health Minister Masoud Pezeshkian. Official results from the June 28 first-round vote gave Pezeshkian 44% of the vote, four points ahead of Jalili, with two other ultraconservatives lagging behind. The inability of any candidate to clinch at least 50% of the vote triggered the runoff between the top two performers.\n\nMost of the Iranian electorate boycotted the first round, with the government reporting an official turnout of 40%.\n\nThe U.S. says the Islamic republic\u2019s elections are neither free nor fair because its ruling system disqualifies candidates deemed not sufficiently loyal to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The Iranian government also has a record of inflating turnout figures to boost its domestic legitimacy, according to independent research and advocacy groups such as U.S.-based United Against Nuclear Iran.\n\nUANI\u2019s director of research on Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Kasra Aarabi, co-authored a June 25 report asserting that a shadowy IRGC branch called the Baqiatallah Headquarters has been a leading force in rigging Iranian presidential and parliamentary elections. The report cited what it called primary Persian sources, including official IRGC material, presentations and recordings obtained from government offices.\n\nIn a statement to VOA, Iran's U.N. Mission in New York reacted to the UANI report by saying the Guardian Council, an Iranian body stacked with Khamenei loyalists who vet presidential candidates, is responsible for verifying the accuracy of elections and addressing complaints.\n\n\"Regarding the first round of the presidential election, the Guardian Council has confirmed the validity of the outcome,\u201d the statement said.\n\nAarabi discussed the potential of a manipulated vote and weak turnout for the presidential runoff election on Thursday\u2019s edition of VOA\u2019s Flashpoint Global Crises program.\n\nThe following interview transcript has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nVOA: Will we see the same kind of record low turnout that we saw in the election's first round?\n\nKasra Aarabi, United Against Nuclear Iran: We can expect this to happen again in the second round. Despite Khamenei trying hard to increase political participation and revive the manufactured, hard-liner-reformist dichotomy between Jalili and Pezeshkian, Iranians are not buying it. They no longer believe the Islamic republic can be reformed. They believe that Jalili and Pezeshkian are two sides of the same coin.\n\nIn spite of the low participation numbers, Khamenei has been relatively successful in creating the illusion of false competition inside the country for an external audience. If you look at Western media coverage of the election, he has been able to manufacture a bit of a buzz for this election. Although Iranians have not fallen into Khamenei\u2019s trap, at least some of the outside world has. So on that count, he will be partially satisfied.\n\nVOA: Given that relative moderate Pezeshkian got a bit more votes than ultraconservative Jalili in the first round, and we do not know how voters who picked the other two ultraconservative candidates may vote in the runoff, what does this uncertainty signify about the election?\n\nAarabi: When we consider the idea that Pezeshkian is a reformist who presents what some might call a golden opportunity for change, let's be real.\n\nPower in Iran is completely centralized in the hands of the supreme leader, his office \u2014 the Beit-e Rahbari \u2014 and the IRGC.\n\nAnd who is Pezeshkian? He endorsed and supported the paramilitary Basij forces who were suppressing Iranians in the streets in the 2022 Mahsa Amini anti-government protests. He played a key role in introducing the compulsory hijab for women and girls in universities and hospitals in the early years of the Islamic revolution. He expressed full support for the IRGC and even wore Revolutionary Guard outfits. He is not a reformist by any count, but he adopted this veneer of reformism.\n\nVOA: Would you say that there is any meaningful difference between Pezeshkian and Jalili?\n\nAarabi: There is no meaningful difference in terms of substance, because all strategic policy is determined by Khamenei. He has been ruling Iran in absolute terms for more than 30 years.\n\nAppearance is perhaps the only thing that is different. With Jalili, you get the true essence of the Islamic republic and its real face. With the narrative built around Pezeshkian, you get a masked individual and a veneer of reformism. Iranians inside the country do not buy this anymore. The popular Persian slogan inside Iran has been: \"Hard-liner, reformist, your time is up, the game is over.\" That is why people are boycotting the elections.\n\nOutside Iran, the illusion of a so-called reformist Iranian president could shape Western policy toward the Islamic republic and could lead to an easing of pressure on the regime. I think Western powers are so determined to hold on to this idea that the Islamic republic can be reformed, that a \"reformist\" president would prompt them to change their Iran policy. But it would not change the Iranian regime's policy, because that policy is in the hands of the supreme leader. He has made it very clear that the regime is becoming more aggressive, more ideological and more strategically reckless.",

        "text": "Not Just Trump: America\u2019s Growing Problem With Race\nDuring the first presidential debate of the 2024 race, former President Donald Trump once again used racially charged rhetoric, this time to attack President Joe Biden as a \u201cvery bad Palestinian.\u201d The former president followed it up the next day by repeating the same smear against Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. Only a few days earlier, Trump doubled down on his disparaging rhetoric aimed at undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe former president\u2019s incendiary remarks and track record on race make it easy to personalize the challenge his nativist presidential campaign poses to America\u2019s multi-racial and multi-ethnic nation. Trump, however, is not operating in a vacuum. Instead, the former president is feeding off the enduring undercurrents of racism in our society, our politics, and our institutions. Evidence is often hiding in plain sight. Consider the decisions and actions of our judicial system, state governments, and national politicians.\n\nFor instance, in late May, the Supreme Court upheld South Carolina\u2019s racially determined gerrymandering of congressional constituencies. That decision followed a U.S. appeals court ruling last year that limits the ability of individuals or organizations to sue under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which protects against racial discrimination. The governor of Virginia has vetoed laws meant to strip tax exempt status from organizations commemorating the Confederacy, and a state school board restored names celebrating Confederate generals to public schools. Nearly 90 percent of House Republicans (192 Members in all) voted in June to restore a racist monument \u2013 featuring a Black female slave holding the child of a white Confederate officer \u2013 to Arlington National Cemetery. The effort was narrowly defeated after just two dozen Republicans joined every Democrat in rejecting it.\n\nThere are initiatives across multiple states to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs while portraying White Americans as the true victims of racism. National opinion leaders such as Elon Musk and former Fox News host Tucker Carlson have spread the white nationalist \u201cGreat Replacement\u201d theory, which holds that white Americans are deliberately being replaced with immigrants of color. The governors in Texas and Florida regularly use language more suited to an armed conflict than governing, as they attack the Biden administration\u2019s immigration reforms and attempt to justify increasingly restrictive legislation against irregular migrants, almost all non-white. Senior Trump aide Stephen Miller reportedly plans to focus on alleged \u201canti-white racism\u201d should the former president win a second term in November. Nationwide, antisemitism and anti-Muslim discrimination are on the rise.\n\nBiden has begun pushing back against the challenge of resurgent racism in our society. In his address on antisemitism at the Holocaust Memorial Museum in May, as well as in his recent commencement speeches for Howard University and Morehouse College, the President called out \u201cthe poison of white supremacy.\u201d In his remarks on the occasion of a Juneteenth concert at the White House, Biden spoke again in general terms about \u201cold ghosts in new garments\u201d seeking \u201cto erase and rewrite history.\u201d\n\nBut as the examples above indicate, the specifics also matter: the challenge is national, systemic, and sustained, threatening minorities across the United States.\n\n*****\n\nIn another era, Trump\u2019s statements about immigrants poisoning the national bloodstream, as well as his plans to oversee a mass deportation of undocumented migrants, comments about Israel-hating Jews, vow to ban Muslims from entering the country, and racist smears aimed at his political rivals would have disqualified him from becoming the presidential nominee of a major party.\n\nNot now. Crowds at Trump rallies cheer his messaging \u2013 and there is little to no pushback from establishment Republicans, even those who supposedly oppose the former president.\n\nTrump critics like former presidential candidate Nikki Haley, former Attorney General William Barr, New Hampshire governor Chris Sununu have all endorsed Trump, claiming that President Biden is a bigger threat to the country. Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell has also endorsed Trump, remaining silent as the former president insults his Asian-American spouse with an ethnic slur. Some Republicans who are themselves minorities counterattack when racist trends within the party are pointed out, as was the case with Senator Tim Scott, who claimed \u201cthe most racist [people] in this country are liberals.\u201d Haley has also adopted a dismissive attitude, stating that the United States has \u201cnever been a racist country.\u201d\n\nIt is not enough to rationalize, as Senator Rubio did in reference to Trump, that \u201che doesn\u2019t talk like a traditional politician.\u201d At a certain point, the now ubiquitous prevalence of racialist speech should be a cause of profound concern for the nation. Nor is this simply a matter of troubling language.\n\n*****\n\nPoliticians at the national and state levels are rewriting our history of slavery and race relations. Florida has led the charge, revising its educational curriculum to suggest the institution was of benefit to the enslaved. Eighteen states are imposing constraints on how race is taught in schools. These revisionist efforts are aimed at changing how we perceive minorities not just in the past, but also in modern America.\n\nOn the Supreme Court, Justice Samuel Alito disparaged both self-identification and the role of race in history when he asked the value of a student saying, \u201cI\u2019m Hispanic, I\u2019m African American, I\u2019m Asian?\u201d Some of the justices are unwilling to question the notion of a \u201ccolor-blind Constitution,\u201d which enshrined the principle of Black lives being worth less than white ones, as they also sidestep the court\u2019s own long history of supporting discrimination.\n\nThe Court\u2019s 2023 decision on affirmative action opened the doors to a flood of efforts to eliminate DEI in education, government, and the private sector. One can acknowledge the debate on DEI and affirmative action programs yet still recognize the continuing need to remove the barriers to equality of opportunity. Instead, DEI programs are being terminated in their entirety at public universities in Florida and Alabama, with more than twenty states possibly following suit. The U.S. House of Representatives has quietly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion. Companies are also looking at whether they need to continue with DEI programs.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation blueprint (Project 2025) for a second Trump administration goes further, advocating the end of all DEI in government, as has the former president. In Congress, the \u201cDismantle DEI Act\u201d was introduced by Republicans on June 12, stating in part, that \u201cthe DEI agenda is a destructive ideology that breeds hatred and racial division.\u201d\n\nConcurrently, state restrictions on voter registration, voting day procedures, and the rights of election officials to certify results are gaining pace. Fourteen states enacted restrictive voting laws in 2023, according to the Brennan Center. The efforts are national, though Alabama\u2019s elimination of majority Black districts was so egregious it was blocked by the Supreme Court.\n\nMore generally, the targeting of minorities has become more widespread since the 2020 COVID pandemic, when Americans of Asian descent faced racial harassment. Two years after the conviction of officers for the murder of George Floyd, police killings were at a decade high in 2023, with Blacks again representing a disproportionate number of the victims. American Jews fear for their safety. Arab Americans express a similar sentiment.\n\n*****\n\nMainstream national media covering the presidential campaign, and not wishing to appear partisan, struggles to offer balanced coverage of the candidates\u2019 approach to race. The fact is, however, that white supremacy, as Jennifer Rubin writes, is a subtext of the Trump presidential campaign, with little or no pushback from the mainstream leadership of his party. It may be impolitic to suggest that racial animus is a motivating factor for a critical mass of voters this year, but polling suggests that this is indeed the case\n\nThere is no indication that attempts to use race as a divider in our national politics will stop anytime soon, raising the stakes of the presidential choice facing Americans on November 5. The consequences for minorities in a second Trump administration could be devastating.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Senator Bill Cassidy (R-La.) had endorsed Trump. He has not endorsed the former president.\n\nImage: Former U.S. President Donald Trump sits at the defendant\u2019s table for his trial for allegedly covering up hush money payments at Manhattan Criminal Court on April 22, 2024 in New York City.

        "text": "Project 2025 head says 'second American Revolution' will be 'bloodless if the left allows'\nThe president of The Heritage Foundation, a right-wing think tank, said the Supreme Court\u2019s presidential immunity ruling is encouraging and that the group, known for Project 2025, is already in the process of \u201ctaking the country back.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are in the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be,\u201d Kevin Roberts said in an interview on Steve Bannon\u2019s \u201cWar Room\u201d podcast on Tuesday.\n\nThe Supreme Court granted former President Donald Trump limited immunity from prosecution for official acts in the ruling that split the justices 6-3 along ideological lines. Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the ruling dangerously expands the chief executive\u2019s power and makes presidents \u201ca king above the law.\u201d\n\nRoberts said Monday\u2019s decision is vital to ensuring a president won\u2019t have to \u201csecond guess, triple guess every decision they\u2019re making.\u201d He also alluded that it will help usher in Project 2025 if Trump wins reelection in November.\n\nThe 2025 Presidential Transition Project, as it is otherwise known, is a detailed 900-page \u201cMandate for Leadership\u201d that lays out an administration-in-waiting for the next conservative president. It seeks to redefine the executive branch, including overhauling several government agencies and replacing civil servants with political appointees. The plan has critics up in arms and concerned about its \u201capocalyptic\u201d and \u201cauthoritarian\u201d nature.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\n\u201cIn spite of all this nonsense from the left, we are going to win. We\u2019re in the process of taking this country back,\u201d Roberts said Tuesday. \u201cThe reason that they are apoplectic right now, the reason that so many anchors on MSNBC, for example, are losing their minds daily is because our side is winning.\u201d\n\nRoberts\u2019s appearance on \u201cWar Room\u201d raised red flags for Democrats, who reacted with concern to his comments.\n\nJames Singer, a spokesperson for the Biden-Harris 2024 campaign, responded in a statement drawing attention to the Fourth of July.\n\n\u201c248 years ago tomorrow, America declared independence from a tyrannical king, and now Donald Trump and his allies want to make him one at our expense,\u201d Singer said. \u201cthey are dreaming of a violent revolution to destroy the very idea of America.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to USA TODAY Wednesday afternoon, Roberts alleged that it is organized groups on the left that \u201chave the capacity to carry out violent riots.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmericans in 2024 are in the process of carrying out the Second American Revolution to take power back from the elites and despotic bureaucrats,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cThese patriots are committed to peaceful revolution at the ballot box.\u201d\n\nPerennial political candidate and spiritual leader Marianne Williamson also responded on X, formerly Twitter, adding, \u201cThis is chilling.

        "text": "Bookmakers Put Their Money On Kamala Harris As Biden\u2019s Odds Tank In Betting Markets\nTopline\n\nThe betting markets believe President Joe Biden\u2019s poor performance in last week\u2019s presidential debate has not only severely dented his chances of beating former President Donald Trump in November\u2019s elections, but also raised the possibility of him being replaced on the ballot by his running mate and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThe betting markets predict Vice President Kamala Harris is best poise to replace President Joe ... [+] Biden on ballot if he drops out of the race. Getty Images\n\nKey Facts\n\nAccording to the prediction market platform Polymarket, Biden\u2019s becoming the Democratic nominee for November\u2019s election tanked from a fairly assured 90% on Thursday morning to 49% as of early Wednesday. After some fluctuations over the weekend, a steep decline from 78% to 49% occurred on Tuesday itself, as the former president faced some pushback from within the Democratic party. As Biden\u2019s chances have fallen, the betting market is putting its money on Harris, whose odds have risen from 1% before the debate to 35% early Wednesday, according to Polymarket. Another prediction platform taking bets on the election, PredictIt, has given Biden even worse odds of 40 cents per share (equating to a 40% chance), putting him on par with Harris\u2014after the president was steadily above 84 cents per share last week before the debate. After being behind California Gov. Gavin Newsom following the debate, the vice president surged ahead of all other potential Democratic nominees on PredictIt\u2019s market\u2014going from 14 cents a share on Monday to 40 cents on Wednesday.\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We\u2019re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day\u2019s headlines. Text \u201cAlerts\u201d to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\n\nSurprising Fact\n\nWhile the betting market on PredictIt suggests Biden fell behind Trump in the presidential race in mid-May, the president\u2019s shaky debate performance appears to have convinced bookmakers he has a worse chance than Harris of winning the November election. Wednesday morning\u2019s odds for the question \u201cWho will win the 2024 US presidential election?\u201d show Trump leading with a 58% chance, followed by the vice president at 21% and Biden at 19%.\n\nBig Number\n\n53%. That is the betting market\u2019s prediction on the chances of Biden dropping out of the presidential race before the Democratic convention, according to Polymarket.\n\nTangent\n\nWhile Harris is the bookmaker\u2019s favorite to replace Biden if he drops out, a Reuters-Ipsos poll suggests voters believe a different Democratic candidate has the best chance of beating Trump in November. In a survey conducted early this week, former First Lady Michelle Obama emerged as the only candidate comfortably ahead of Trump in a direct match. The former first lady, however, has repeatedly said she has no interest in running for president. While Biden and Trump are at an even 40% each in a head-to-head, Obama polled 11 points ahead of Trump at 50% to 39%. In the same poll nearly a third of all Democrat voters (32%) said Biden should drop out of the race after his debate performance.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nKamala Harris Leads Major Biden Alternatives In Polls\u2014Here\u2019s How The President\u2019s Top Replacements Are Polling (Forbes)\n\nCan Democrats Replace Biden?

The source of the funds was supposedly American military aid money.\n\nThe story appeared on an obscure French website just days ago - and was swiftly debunked.\n\nExperts pointed out strange anomalies on the invoice posted online. A whistleblower cited in the story appeared only in an oddly edited video that may have been artificially created. Bugatti issued a sharp denial, calling it \"fake news\", external, and its Paris dealership threatened legal action against the people behind the false story.\n\nBut before the truth could even get its shoes on, the lie had gone viral. Influencers had already picked up the false story and spread it widely.\n\nOne X user, the pro-Russia, pro-Donald Trump activist Jackson Hinkle, posted a link seen by more than 6.5m people. Several other accounts spread the story to millions more X users \u2013 at least 12m in total, according to the site\u2019s metrics.\n\nIt was a fake story, on a fake news website, designed to spread widely online, with its origins in a Russia-based disinformation operation BBC Verify first revealed last year - at which point the operation appeared to be trying to undermine Ukraine\u2019s government.",

        "text": "Why Joe Biden Should Stay in the Race\nPresident Joe Biden\u2019s performance during the June 27 debate with former President Donald Trump inspired panic among some supporters. In its wake, some have called for Biden to bow out of the 2024 election in favor either of Vice President Kamala Harris or a range of the party\u2019s rising stars including swing-state governors Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, J.B. Pritzker of Illinois, and Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania.\n\nImage American University Professor Allan Lichtman, PhD \u201973 / Wiki Commons\n\nNot so fast says American University Professor Allan Lichtman , PhD \u201973. Lichtman, who has correctly predicted the results of 9 of the last 10 presidential elections using a system he developed in 1981 with mathematician Vladimir Keilis-Borok, says that Democrats\u2019 prospects for victory in November would be far worse if Biden stepped aside. In this conversation with Havard Griffin GSAS Communications, he asserts that it would be a \u201chuge mistake\u201d to forfeit the electoral advantages of incumbency and of having a candidate who has had no serious challenges from within his own party.\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity, correctness, and length.\n\nBefore we get to your model, do you have concerns about Biden\u2019s ability to campaign effectively and to handle the presidency at his age?\n\nSure I have some concerns, but not about his ability to campaign effectively. He had some excellent, energetic events after the debate. He delivered one of the great State of the Union addresses just a few months ago when he was able to ad-lib and respond to the audience. It was a bravura performance.\n\nEven so . . .\n\nLook, I'm not a neurologist\u2014and neither are the critics going after Joe Biden. They have no basis to offer an opinion on Biden\u2019s cognitive capacities. Beyond that, what all these folks share in common is that none of them have a track record in predicting elections, and yet they claim to know what the Democrats must do to win.\n\nLet me read you a couple of headlines: \u201cDebate Debacle,\u201d \u201cGreat Concern at Democratic Headquarters.\u201d Those aren\u2019t headlines from after last Thursday\u2019s debate; those are from after Barack Obama\u2019s performance in the first presidential debate of 2012. Afterward, a CNN poll showed that 72 percent of viewers thought Obama lost, which was worse than the 67 percent who thought Biden lost last Thursday. And, of course, Obama went on to win an electoral college landslide, 332 to 206. On the other hand, when Hillary Clinton won all three debates in 2016\u2014and then again after the Access Hollywood tape\u2014the pundits said Trump was finished. Now they\u2019re telling us Biden\u2019s finished after one debate. It's nonsense.\n\nHow many times in the last 120 years has the party holding the White House prevailed in the elections where the incumbent didn\u2019t run? Never.\n\n\u2014Allan Lichtman\n\nYou mentioned having a track record in predicting presidential elections. You\u2019ve correctly predicted nine of the last ten using a system of 13 key factors : party mandate, contest, incumbency, serious third-party campaign, short-term economy, long-term economy, policy change, social unrest, scandal, foreign/military failure, foreign/military success, incumbent charisma, and challenger charisma. If 8 of the 13 are favorable to the incumbent, they win. If less than eight are favorable, they lose. So why does the model lead you to argue that Biden should stay in the race?\n\nThe keys gauge the strength and performance of the White House party. That is, they're premised on the finding that American presidential elections are votes up or down on the strength and performance of the party in power.\n\nBiden checks off two keys; obviously, he\u2019s an incumbent and his path to the nomination was uncontested. That means that 6 of the remaining 11 keys would have to be negative in order to predict the Democrats\u2019 defeat. If Biden gets bumped, the Democrats lose the incumbency key and the party contest key because there's no heir apparent. That means only four more keys would have to be unfavorable.\n\nBut let's leave aside the keys and look at history. How many times in the last 120 years has the party holding the White House prevailed in the elections where the incumbent didn\u2019t run as in 1920, 1952, 1968, 2008, or 2016? Never. It\u2019s a sure prescription for defeat. In effect, those calling for Biden to step aside want to recreate the same set of circumstances that led to defeat in 2016.\n\nIf the odds are still in favor of the incumbent, why hasn't it shown up in the polls?\n\nPolls are snapshots, not predictors. Remember, the pollsters assured us Hillary Clinton was bound to win in 2016. In fact, the Princeton Election Consortium said there was a 99 percent chance that Clinton would win. The eminent professor, Sam Wang, said, \u201cIf I'm wrong I'll eat a bug on national TV.\u201d And he did. The last Gallup poll showed Romney beating Obama in 2012. So, I don't use the polls for prediction.\n\nThis is a particularly fluid election. We have the debate. We're going to have the sentencing of Donald Trump on July 11. We may have a mini-trial on his immunity claim in New York. We have two conventions coming up. So, even if you believe the polls, it's way too early.\n\nFinally, could things be different this time? Take a look at the economy, for instance. Unemployment is at or near a 50-year low, GDP is strong, the stock market is at or near an all-time high, inflation has cooled, and real wages have risen for those who need it most. And yet many Americans believe the economy is in recession . Is it possible that traditional criteria won\u2019t be as predictive at a time when perceptions and data are diverging?\n\nI\u2019m a historian not a psychic. It's always possible, in any given year, that events could be so different that they break the pattern of history. But the keys are very robust. Developmentally they go back to 1860\u2014the horse and buggy days when Abe Lincoln was elected. Predictively, they go back to 1984 when Ronald Reagan was elected to a second term.\n\nWhat I think you're putting your finger on outside the context of the keys is a horrendous message deficit on the part of the Democrats. That was partly what we saw in the debate. It wasn't just Biden not being a great debater. It was that whoever prepared him didn't create a good message. And that's why there's this disconnect between the reality of the economy and a lot of perceptions. I've been screaming about the Democratic deficit in messaging for years. They don't seem to hear it.",

Michelle Obama's office has again confirmed that she will not run for president in 2024.(AFP)\n\nThis comes amidst Democrats' concerns regarding the rerun of 81-year-old Biden following his disastrous presidential debate performance and worries around his mental and physical fitness. They believe these concerns may well be resolved if they manage to convince Michelle Obama to declare her candidacy.\n\nAccording to NBC News, Michelle's office has again confirmed that she will not run for president in 2024. \u201cAs former First Lady Michelle Obama has expressed several times over the years, she will not be running for president.\u201d\n\nCalling politics \u201chard\u201d, she said: \u201cIt's got to be in your soul, because it is so important. It is not in my soul.\u201d\n\nMichelle intends to support the Biden campaign, focusing on voter turnout.\n\nIs Michelle Obama only Biden alternative to beat Trump?\n\nMichelle Obama, 60, is the only potential opponent who can defeat Republican leader Donald Trump in the 2024 White House race, as per a new poll.\n\nAccording to a Reuters and Ipsos poll, the former first lady would defeat Trump, 78, by ten points, and no other contender could defeat the former president.\n\nLast week, Biden made a number of verbal blunders during the catastrophic debate performance in which US President.\n\nMichelle's support skyrocketed despite previously declaring that she wouldn't run for office and continue to support Biden's reelection.\n\nWhen asked which Democratic candidate they would prefer, half of the respondents stated they would vote for Michelle, while only 39% indicated they would vote for Trump.\n\nIf Biden steps down from the race, the front-runners who can succeed him include Gavin Newsom or Kamala Harris. However, they were polled significantly lower than Trump.\n\nAccording to the poll, one in three Democrats believe that the president should withdraw from the campaign following the CNN debate. However, no well-known elected Democrat performed any better than Biden. Nearly fifty percent of the respondents surveyed felt that Trump should withdraw from the race, while three out of five believe that Biden should.\n\nAlso Read: Biden mocks Trump for thinking he had the 'greatest economy in the world'\n\nBiden admits he fell asleep on stage\n\nBiden blamed his poor debate performance on two international travels in June that involved \"going through 100 time zones\". He made this claim during a meeting with his family members and confidants at Camp David.\n\n\u201d[I] didn\u2019t listen to my staff and came back and nearly fell asleep on stage,\u201d he stated while attributing his lackluster performance to jet lag. \u201cThat\u2019s no excuse but it is an explanation.\u201d",

The Guardian explains that the ruling exempts Trump from criminal prosecution \u201cfor all acts that can be interpreted as part of the official course of his 'core' duties, and 'presumptive' immunity for all other official acts.\u201d Current US President Joe Biden denounced the ruling.\n\nThe court cases came on the back of the 6 January 2021 insurrection, which saw Trump supporters storm the Capitol Building, which is where the US Congress meets to write laws, and where US Presidents are inaugurated.\n\nSuch a ruling sets a worrying precedent not only for Trump, but for future abuses of power from US Presidents.\n\nGreen light for dictatorship\n\nProfessor Inderjeet Parmar, Professor of International Politics at City, University of London, researches and teaches US foreign policy and global politics. He is the co-author of \u201cAnglo-American Power in the Wake of Brexit and America First\" (Routledge, 2023).\n\nIn reaction to the news, and offering a historical precedent for how Biden can fight the ruling, he said:\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling gives the green light for a dictatorship in the US. The ruling is a subversion of the constitution and democratic norms of accountability.\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court has now provided a green light for presidents to do whatever they deem fit to \u2018defend\u2019 the republic against \u2018enemies\u2019, whether they are real or politically imagined.\n\n\n\nSuch presidential immunity is unprecedented and may be used to build an effective dictatorship in the United States.\n\n\n\nThe appetite for democracy, constitutional norms, and checks and balances among US elites is dying. Democracy only just made it through on January 6, 2021.\n\n\n\nThis ruling means the US is unable to claim to be a beacon of democracy in the world, and an opponent of authoritarianism.\n\n\n\nIt further underlines the level of unreliability, instability and volatility of US politics. As the world\u2019s lead state, it also sends signals that normalises authoritarianism worldwide.\n\n\n\nTrump has already vowed revenge on his political opponents and to act like a dictator if re-elected.\n\n\n\nThis will be seen as cementing the power of Trump and his Republican party and will embolden him and his supporters.\n\n\n\nBiden could do more than simply disavow the ruling. He has the power to appoint more supreme court justices to balance out the Conservative bench. President Roosevelt used this tactic back in 1937, when the Supreme Court ruled against aspects of his New Deal programme.\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling in handing such great power to a president reverses the critique of an imperial presidency and paves the way to a potential dictatorship.\n\n\n\nIn the 1970s, there was a backlash against the idea of an \u2018imperial presidency\u2019 in the US, and a desire to curb the power of the White House, particularly after Watergate, Vietnam, and the secret bombing of Cambodia and Laos that led to tens of thousands of deaths.\n\n\n\nThe Justice Sotomayor has said that \u2018the President is now a king above the law.\u2019 In 1977, President Nixon said about his abuse of power: \u201cwhen the President does it, that means it is not illegal\u201d. This was widely considered to demonstrate Richard Nixon\u2019s criminal character. Now it has been declared by the highest court to be the new normal.\n\nA major setback for democracy with a ripple effect far beyond Trump Dr Andrew Payne, Lecturer in Foreign Policy and Security at City, University of London recently won the Neustadt Book Prize 2023 for his book \u201cWar on the Ballot: How the Election Cycle Shapes Presidential Decision-Making in War\u201d (Columbia, 2023).

        "text": "Message for U.S. Citizens: Celebrate Democracy this July 4th by ensuring you are prepared to vote in the 2024 U.S. Election\nTo vote in the November 2024 election, U.S. citizens overseas need to have completed a Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) in 2024. Whether you are a first-time voter or have already received ballots and voted absentee in past elections, you must complete an FPCA each calendar year to ensure you can participate in elections as an overseas absentee voter.\n\nYou can always get voting assistance from the embassy/consulate or drop off your completed voting forms and ballots, addressed to your local election officials, during the following hours:\n\nMonday thru Thursday, 0900 \u2013 1700\n\nFriday, 0900 \u2013 1130\n\nNormal transit time from Nouakchott to the United States is 14-21 days.\n\nEven if you have never voted while overseas before, the process is easy.\n\n1. Request your ballot. Complete a new Federal Post Card Application (FPCA). You must complete a new FPCA after January 1, 2024, to ensure you receive your ballot for the 2024 elections. Submitting the FPCA allows you to request absentee ballots for all elections for federal offices (President, U.S. Senate, and U.S. House of Representatives) including primaries and special elections during the calendar year in which it is submitted. All local election officials in all U.S. states and territories accept the FPCA.\n\nYou can complete the FPCA online at FVAP.gov. The online voting assistant will ask you questions specific to your state. We encourage you to request your blank ballots be delivered electronically (by email, internet download, or fax, depending on your state). Include your email address on your FPCA to take advantage of the electronic ballot delivery option. Return the FPCA per the instructions on the website. The online voting assistant will tell you if your state allows the FPCA to be returned electronically or if you must submit a paper copy with original ink signature. If you must return a paper version, please follow the same instructions below for returning your ballot.\n\n2. Receive and complete your ballot. States are required to send out ballots 45 days before a regular election for federal office and generally send ballots at least 30 days before primary elections. For most states, you can confirm your registration and ballot delivery online.\n\n3. Return your completed ballot. While some states allow you to return your completed ballot electronically, others do not. If your state requires you to return paper voting forms or ballots to local election officials, you can do so free of charge at the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate. Place your ballot in a postage-paid return envelope, or in an envelope bearing sufficient domestic U.S. postage, and address it to the relevant local election officials.\n\n4. Research candidates and issues. Please see the FVAP links page for resources you can use to research candidates and issues.

Abigail Disney, an heiress to the Disney family fortune, told business news channel CNBC that she did not believe Mr Biden could win against Trump.\n\nShe said her intent to pull support was rooted in \u201crealism, not disrespect\u201d.\n\n\u201cBiden is a good man and has served his country admirably, but the stakes are far too high.\"\n\nThe consequences of defeat in November \"will be genuinely dire\u201d, she added.\n\nMs Disney has given thousands of dollars to left-leaning political groups this year, according to Federal Election Commission records. But a spokesperson for the Biden campaign told BBC News she has not donated to the campaign directly this cycle.\n\nA handful of other wealthy donors have conveyed similar intent.\n\nPhilanthropist Gideon Stein told the New York Times that his family was withholding $3.5m (\u00a32.8m) to non-profit and political organisations active in the presidential race unless Mr Biden steps aside.\n\nHollywood producer Damon Lindelof, who has donated more than $100,000 to Democrats this election cycle, wrote a public essay in Deadline urging other donors to withhold their funds until there is a change.\n\nThe brother of Barack Obama's former chief of staff, Hollywood agent Ari Emanuel, told a conference in Colorado that withholding funding was the key to ensuring Mr Biden's exit from the race, the Financial Times reported on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe lifeblood to a campaign is money, and maybe the only way . . . is if the money starts drying up,\u201d he said, according to the newspaper.",

        "text": "Interview | Shanto Iyengar on affective polarisation in US and European politics\nOn 27-28 June, the European Governance and Politics Programme hosted Professor Shanto Iyengar, who delivered the keynote speech at the workshop titled 'Towards affective depolarisation? Finding remedies to affective polarisation in democracies.'\n\nShanto Iyengar is William Robertson Coe Professor and Professor of Political Science and of Communication, Director of the Communication at Stanford University. He is also currently the co-principal investigator of the American National Elections Studies.\n\nIn the interview with Dietlind Stolle, James McGill Professor in Political Science at McGill University, Iyengar shared insights on affective polarisation in US and European politics, the media's role, and the spillover of polarisation into daily life, including education, public health, and misinformation.\n\nRegarding whether the presidential debate could influence voter opinions, Iyengar stated, \u201cThe country [US] is highly polarised. This has happened over the last 50 or 60 years and it has reached the point where two political parties see each other as existential threats... So my sense is that the debate, given the polarised state of American politics, it\u2019s not going to change anyone\u2019s opinion.\u201d He noted that the only voters potentially swayed by the debate are the independent ones, who make up only about 15-17% of the electorate.\n\nIyengar also examined the European political landscape, highlighting immigration as a common divisive issue on both continents. \u201cIt is that which has led to the rise of populist movements and populist parties, and therefore you [Europe] have now a very similar intense argumentation over this issue which increases people\u2019s emotional stake that they have in politics.\u201d He further explained the differences between US and European party systems, signaling that the issue of affective polarisation in Europe is more complicated.\n\nWhen discussing the spillover of affective polarisation, Iyengar remarked, \u201cThe divide has spread into entirely non-political debates. People are now dating co-partisans... About 80% of American households today, if you have two adults living together, they have the same party registration.\u201d\n\nRegarding whether this phenomenon is \u2018treatable\u2019, Iyengar suggested, \u201cI think the next step, logically, is to get a causal dynamics... And my view is that you have to look at the media environment as the fundamental cause.\u201d\n\nA full recording of Professor Shanto Iyengar\u2019s keynote speech, titled 'Affective polarisation: assessing the state of the field' is available on the European Governance Programme\u2019s YouTube channel.",

        "text": "Swing states: Why these 7 states could decide the 2024 presidential election\narticle\n\nFor many U.S. states that consistently vote red or blue in presidential elections , the outcome is no surprise. But for some states, the electoral votes remain very much up for grabs.\n\nThe 2024 presidential election \u2013 a rematch of President Joe Biden vs. former President Donald Trump \u2013 there are seven states expected to be political battlegrounds with their outcomes too close to predict.\n\nIt takes 270 electoral votes to win the White House, and these swing states have a collective 93 votes that could ultimately decide who will take the White House.\n\nHere are the key battleground states to pay attention to as voters head to the polls on Tuesday, Nov. 5, 2024:\n\nWhat\u2019s a swing state, again?\n\nA \"swing state\" in U.S. presidential elections is a state that could \"swing\" to either Democratic or Republican candidates. This means such candidates often make frequent campaign visits and spend a considerable amount of time and resources in an effort to win there.\n\nSuch states tend to be predictors of the overall presidential winner \u2013 such as Florida, which famously became the deciding state in the 2000 election between Republican Texas Gov. George W. Bush and incumbent Democratic Vice President Al Gore.\n\nSeveral other states have also been reliable indicators of overall results, according to USAFacts , a nonprofit site sharing easy-to-read government data.\n\nSince 2000, five states \u2014 Colorado , Florida , Nevada , Ohio , and Virginia \u2014 have matched the eventual winner in all but one presidential election, USAFacts said.\n\nPrevious swing states leaning red in 2024\n\nThe U.S. states given \"swing\" status have also changed over time. Florida and Ohio , for example, both appear to be moving \"stage right\" in 2024 after being battlegrounds in the past.\n\n\"Both Ohio and Florida seem likely Republican this time around,\" said Prof. Aubrey Jewett, a University of Central Florida political science professor.\n\n\"Florida seems to have surged strong Republican in the past four years re-electing Republican Governor DeSantis by almost 20 points (after winning his first term by less than 1%) and seeing Republicans take a lead in voter registration of more than 900,000 after being behind by 100,000 about 3 years ago,\" Jewett added.\n\nMeanwhile, Ohio voted for Trump in 2020 by 8 points, so it \"seems likely to vote for him again,\" Jewett said.\n\nNo states seemed to have moved from competitive status to left-leaning or Democratic, Jewett noted.\n\nWhat are the 2024 swing states?\n\nHere are the seven swing states to watch in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nArizona (Electoral votes: 11)\n\nArizona has long been considered reliably red and has almost exclusively chosen Republicans in presidential elections.\n\nBut the state is transforming rapidly and increasingly becoming a battleground state ahead of the 2024 election, according to experts.\n\nMany point to Biden\u2019s 2020 win as a key indicator of the state\u2019s \"purple\" status. Despite its narrow margin, Biden won the state by 0.3%, and his 49.4% support was the highest level for a Democratic candidate since 1964.\n\n\"Arizona is absolutely, fully purple,\" David Byler, elections data expert and chief of research at Noble Predictive Insights told FOX Television Stations. \"It's one of the most \u2013 if not the most \u2013 purple states on the map.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Top issues for Arizona voters in the 2024 presidential election\n\nGeorgia (Electoral votes: 16)\n\nGeorgia has been a fairly-reliable Republican state during each presidential election cycle in recent history, but 2020 showed the state can swing from red to blue \u2013 when Biden won by a very slim margin of 12,670 votes, or 0.25% of the roughly 5 million ballots cast.\n\nBefore that, the Peach State hadn\u2019t voted for a Democratic president since Bill Clinton in 1992.\n\nThere are a plethora of issues at the top of Georgians\u2019 minds ahead of November, but none more so than inflation, according to experts.\n\n\"For two years, (inflation) has been very consistently at the top of Georgians\u2019 minds,\" explained Brian Robinson, former spokesperson for Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal and president of Robinson Republica Communications.\n\n\"It is something that is driving a lot of the movement away from Biden and including from many of those people who voted for him in 2020, a sense that their lives aren't as good as they were four years ago, pre-COVID, that things are tight and and the incumbent gets the blame for that,\" Robinson added.\n\nREAD MORE: Top issues for Georgia voters in the 2024 presidential election\n\nMichigan (Electoral votes: 15)\n\nMichigan's status as a pivotal swing state in 2024 stems from its recent electoral history and the intense focus it receives from presidential candidates, experts say.\n\nThe state has traditionally been a Democratic stronghold, supporting blue candidates from 1992 to 2012.\n\nHowever, it surprised many by flipping to Trump in 2016 \u2013 marking the first time a Republican presidential candidate carried the state since George H.W. Bush in 1988.\n\nTrump's success in the Wolverine State was driven by his appeal to White working-class voters, particularly in rural areas and former industrial hubs.\n\nHis promises to revive manufacturing jobs and renegotiate trade deals resonated deeply in a state historically reliant on the auto industry. His unorthodox campaign style and ability to connect with voters who felt disillusioned by traditional politics also played a crucial role.\n\nMichigan's surprising flip in 2016 underscored its status as a key battleground state, making it a focal point for both parties in subsequent elections.\n\nREAD MORE: Top issues for Michigan voters in the 2024 presidential election\n\nNevada (Electoral votes: 6)\n\nNevada only has six electoral college votes, but the state is still considered an important swing state leading into the 2024 election \u2013 likely coming down to Republicans\u2019 and Democrats\u2019 abilities to mobilize voters.\n\n\"We are the perfect puzzle piece to fit in given where we think these other swing states might land, and we can have a decisive difference,\" University of Nevada Las Vegas associate professor Rebecca Gill told FOX Television Stations.\n\n\"One of the reasons Nevada tends to be so important is that we have close margins in terms of Republicans and Democrats performing in these statewide elections and a lot of it depends on each camp's ability to determine who comes out to vote, so it\u2019s really a mobilization game,\" Gill added.\n\nParticularly, turnout among younger voters in the Silver State will be critical.\n\n\"There\u2019s a lot of buzz right now about young voters being disaffected with Biden, particularly with issues related to (the Israel-Hamas conflict),\" Gill explained, noting how the topic has been focused on frequently by the news media.\n\n\"If you look at the young voters, the things that they are concerned about\u2026 they can\u2019t afford to buy a house, they might have trouble even affording their rent, so economics are a big issue,\" she said.\n\nREAD MORE: Top issues for Nevada voters in the 2024 presidential election\n\nNorth Carolina (Electoral votes: 16)\n\nPolitical insiders believe the race between Biden and Trump is going to be extremely close in North Carolina , a state \"that's almost always extraordinarily close,\" according to UNC-Chapel Hill Political Science Professor Marc Hetherington.\n\n\"It's odd if the presidential election comes out with one candidate winning by more than 3% of the vote, 3.5% of the vote,\" Hetherington told FOX Television Stations.\n\nThe candidate who wins the Tar Heel state will be the one who\u2019s able to deliver clear messages on issues that matter to the people \u2013 including abortion, immigration, and the economy.\n\n\"If you take a look at the numbers, the percentage of people in North Carolina who say jobs in the economy are the most important thing to them, that's the winner by far,\" Hetherington explained. \"That's what everybody agrees on whether they're Republicans or Democrats about what's important.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Top issues for North Carolina voters in the 2024 presidential election\n\nPennsylvania (Electoral votes: 19)\n\nOf all the battleground states in 2024, Pennsylvania has the most electoral votes up for grabs.\n\nTrump took the state by a razor-thin, 0.5% margin in 2016, and Biden edged out a win over Trump in 2020 by a little more than a 1% margin. If the election were held today, political observers in the Keystone State say it\u2019s hard to predict who would come out on top.\n\n\"When you look at the key swing states in this particular election cycle, Pennsylvania stands out,\" Christopher Borick, a political science professor and director of Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion, told FOX Television Stations.\n\nThere are few places in the country as evenly-divided as Pennsylvania, too. The state House, which has 203 members, has a one-member Democratic majority. And in the state Senate, Republicans have a hold there by only three members.\n\n\"It's an incredibly divided state, which reflects what Pennsylvania is,\" Borick explained. \"It has a very large urban area in the southeast, around Philadelphia, also a fairly mid-sized urban area in the Pittsburgh area out west. But it also has one of the largest rural populations in the entire United States.\"\n\nAnd like many states, inflation/the economy , reproductive rights and border security are at the top of voters\u2019 minds.\n\nREAD MORE: Top issues for Pennsylvania voters in the 2024 presidential election\n\nWisconsin (Electoral votes: 10)\n\nIn Wisconsin , four of the past six presidential elections have been decided by less than a percentage point \u2013 earning the state a reputation for turning out extremely close margins.\n\nTrump broke the so-called \"blue wall\" and won Wisconsin in 2016, the first time a Republican presidential candidate had done so since President Ronald Reagan in 1984.\n\n\"It's one of just a handful of states that has been won by Trump in 2016 and lost in 2020,\" explained Julia Azari, a political science professor at Marquette University. \"And historically, it's been just a very competitive state.\"\n\nWisconsin\u2019s local elections in 2022, which include re-electing a Republican senator and Democratic governor, reinforced how much of a toss-up the vote can be, experts say.\n\nREAD MORE: Top issues for Wisconsin voters in the 2024 presidential election\n\nWhat other states could be competitive in 2024?\n\nRepublicans also have some hopes that Trump may be competitive in Virginia and Minnesota .\n\nMinnesota hasn\u2019t voted for a Republican for president since 1972, while Virginia last voted red in the presidential election in 2004.\n\n\"Early polling in both states suggest it is close, but recent history suggests Democrats should win those two states,\" Jewett noted.\n\n\"Virginia did vote for a Republican governor in 2021, although Democrats did better in the 2023 legislative elections,\" Jewett told FOX Television Stations.\n\n\"Republicans also think they may have a chance in New Jersey, although that seems less likely than Virginia to me.\"\n\nThis story was reported from Cincinnati.",

        "text": "Wisconsin Supreme Court will allow expanded use of ballot drop boxes this fall, reversing 2022 decision\nMADISON, Wis. (AP) \u2014 The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled Friday that officials can place ballot drop boxes around their communities in this fall\u2019s elections, overturning its own ruling two years ago limiting their use in the presidential swing state.\n\nThe court limited the use of drop boxes in July 2022, ruling then that they could be placed only in local election clerks\u2019 offices and no one other than the voter could return a ballot in person.\n\nWATCH: Biden holds campaign rally in Wisconsin as economy adds healthy 206,000 jobs\n\nConservatives controlled the court at that time, but Janet Protasiewicz\u2019s election victory in April 2023 flipped the court to liberal control. Seeing an opening, Priorities USA, a progressive voter mobilization group, asked the court in February to revisit the decision.\n\nAt least 29 other states allow for absentee ballot drop boxes, according to the U.S. Vote Foundation, and expanded use in Wisconsin could have major implications in the presidential race.\n\nWisconsin again figures to be a crucial swing state after President Joe Biden barely won it in 2020 and Donald Trump narrowly took it in 2016. Democrats believe that making it easier to vote absentee will boost turnout for their side.\n\nThe justices announced in March they would review the ban on drop boxes but wouldn\u2019t consider any other parts of the case. The move drew the ire of the court\u2019s conservatives, who accused the liberals of trying to give Democrats an advantage this fall. Democratic Gov. Tony Evers in April urged the court to again allow drop boxes.\n\nThe court ruled 4-3 on Friday that drop boxes can be utilized in any location.\n\nJustice Ann Walsh Bradley, one of the court\u2019s four liberal justices, wrote for the majority that placing a ballot in a drop box set up and maintained by a local election clerk is no different than giving the ballot to the clerk, regardless of the box\u2019s location. Local clerks have great discretion in how they administer elections and that extends to using and locating drop boxes, she added.\n\n\u201cOur decision today does not force or require that any municipal clerks use drop boxes,\u201d Bradley wrote. \u201cIt merely acknowledges what (state law) has always meant: that clerks may lawfully utilize secure drop boxes in an exercise of their statutorily-conferred discretion.\u201d\n\nAll three conservative justices dissented. Justice Rebecca Bradley wrote that the liberals are simply trying to advance their political agenda and criticized them for ignoring the precedent set by the 2022 ruling.\n\n\u201cThe majority in this case overrules (the 2022 decision) not because it is legally erroneous, but because the majority finds it politically inconvenient,\u201d Bradley wrote. \u201cThe majority\u2019s activism marks another triumph of political power over legal principle in this court.\u201d\n\nWATCH: How a small Wisconsin community is responding to a recent migrant surge\n\nThe popularity of absentee voting exploded during the pandemic in 2020, with more than 40% of all voters casting mail ballots, a record high. At least 500 drop boxes were set up in more than 430 communities for the election that year, including more than a dozen each in Madison and Milwaukee \u2014 the state\u2019s two most heavily Democratic cities.\n\nTrump and Republicans have alleged that drop boxes facilitated cheating, even though they offered no evidence. Democrats, election officials and some Republicans argued the boxes are secure and an Associated Press survey of state election officials across the U.S. revealed no cases of fraud, vandalism or theft that could have affected the results in 2020.\n\nRepublicans who control the Wisconsin Legislature intervened in the case, arguing that the justices should leave the 2022 ruling alone. Their attorney, Misha Tseytlin, didn\u2019t immediately respond to an email seeking comment Friday.\n\nMatt Fisher, a spokesperson for the state Republican Party, called the decision a \u201csetback.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis latest attempt by leftist justices to placate their far-left backers will not go unanswered by voters,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nDane County Clerk Scott McDonell, who administers elections in the state\u2019s most Democratic county, called drop boxes a \u201ccommon sense tool.\u201d He said they make the election process more convenient and easier for rural and disabled voters and help reduce that number of ballots that arrive after election day too late to be counted.\n\n\u201cHaving drop boxes in place for the 2024 elections in August and November will encourage civic participation in our democracy,\u201d McDonell said in a statement.",

        "text": "2024 U.K. election is set to overhaul British politics. Here's what to know as Labour projected to win.\nLondon \u2014 British voters voted Thursday in the United Kingdom's first general election since 2019, with an exit poll projecting the Labour Party notching 410 seats for a decisive win over the Conservative Party.\n\nAmong those seen heading to their local polling stations were incumbent Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, whom Conservative Party voters were forecast to boot from power after 14 years running the government, and his chief rival and likely replacement, Labour Party leader Keir Starmer.\n\nHere's what to know about the 2024 British general election.\n\nWho is up for election in the U.K.?\n\nBritish voters were not directly electing a new leader on Thursday. Under the United Kingdom's parliamentary system, voters choose their local representatives for the lower house of Parliament, the House of Commons.\n\nOn Thursday, there are 650 parliamentary seats up for grabs, each of which will be occupied by one Member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons. For any single party to win an outright majority in the Commons, it would need to win at least 326 seats \u2014 over half of those available. Any party that does that gets to form the next government, with its leader becoming the prime minister.\n\nAn exit poll projected the Conservative Party garnered just 131 seats, with the Labour Party forecast to win 410 seats.\n\n[Yes, King Charles III is Britain's formal head of state. You can read here about what limited power that actually conveys.]\n\nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his wife Akshata Murty walk outside a polling station before casting their votes in the general election, in Northallerton, northeast England, July 4, 2024. Temilade Adelaja/REUTERS\n\nParliament was formally dissolved on May 30 when Sunak called the election, as is procedure, but prior to that, Sunak's long-ruling Conservative Party held an outright majority of 345 seats, giving it significant power to set the policy agenda.\n\nThe U.K. has what is called a first-past-the-post system, which means voters receive a ballot paper with a list of candidates from different parties and select only one of their choice. The candidate from each constituency with the most votes wins the seat \u2014 with no specific threshold required. So if, for instance, there are six candidates in a particular race, they will all be from different parties, and even if the candidate with the most votes only wins 25% of the total, they still win the seat.\n\nIf a voter believes their favorite candidate has a low chance of winning, they can choose to vote tactically and put their X next to another candidate's name \u2014 effectively a second choice \u2014 if they feel that candidate has a better chance of winning. This tactic is generally seen as a way for a voter to help block a candidate deemed highly unfavorable, but who stands a reasonable chance of winning, from gaining the seat in a race.\n\nIn practice, this system means that a political party could win a healthy share of votes on a national level but not win a proportional share of the seats. Smaller political parties in the U.K. have long argued that the first-past-the-post electoral system has thus helped to cement the power of Britain's two biggest parties \u2014 the incumbent, right-leaning Conservative Party, often called the Tories, and their main rivals, the more left-leaning Labour Party.\n\nLabour Party leader Keir Starmer speaks during a live TV debate with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, seen in the background, in Nottingham, England, June 26, 2024, in the build-up to the U.K. general election. PHIL NOBLE/POOL/AFP/Getty\n\nWhat is the U.K. election timeline?\n\nVoting begins in the U.K. general election on Thursday morning, and most constituency results are expected by early Friday morning, although this may take longer in some more rural parts of the country \u2014 particularly if the vote tally is close or subject to a recount.\n\nThere is usually an early indicator of the overall results of a U.K. general election as a joint exit poll is released by British broadcasters Sky News, ITV and CBS News' partner network BBC News immediately after the polls close. That poll projected Labour's victory.\n\nThe exit poll generally provides an accurate representation of the final results and can be expected by about 10 p.m. on Thursday local time (5 p.m. Eastern).\n\nU.K. election predictions and polling data\n\nPolls and political analysts have predicted for many weeks that Labour will sweep to a landslide majority in Parliament. If the latest polling data proves accurate, Sunak's 18-month tenure will end and Britons will wake up Friday morning to a new party in charge of the country for the first time in 14 years.\n\nThose 14 years of Conservative rule have been marked by political and economic turmoil, with a rotating cast of five Conservative prime ministers occupying 10 Downing Street in the last eight years alone.\n\nThe latest polling by the major independent data analysis group YouGov shows Labour in the lead by a 17-point margin, with 39% of those polled saying they intend to vote for Labour versus 22% of the public who say they will cast their votes for the Conservatives.\n\nLabour candidates are projected to win 430 seats in the House of Commons, which would be a massive 228-seat gain for the party. The Conservatives are projected to hold onto just 130 seats, which would be a seismic loss of 235 seats.\n\nWho is Keir Starmer, the likely next prime minister?\n\nStarmer was elected by party members to lead Labour in 2020, right after the party suffered its worst general election defeat in 85 years. He immediately declared it his mission to make the party \"electable\" again.\n\nFour years later Starmer, 61, is poised to take Britain's top job.\n\nHe's faced frequent criticism for a perceived lack of charisma, but his efforts to drag Labour back toward the center of British politics to give it broader voter appeal seems to have paid off.\n\nBritain's opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer and his wife Victoria Starmer walk outside a polling station during the general election, in London, England, July 4, 2024. Claudia Greco/REUTERS\n\nThroughout his leadership of the party, Starmer has methodically frozen out elements of Labour's far-left, socialist-leaning wing, which ran the party under previous leader Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nStarmer's deliberate shift from socialism to centrism has been criticized by pundits and voters who hew to the left, and Labour may lose some votes to smaller parties such as the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party but, given the polling, it seems to have been a winning strategy overall.\n\nIs Britain bucking the trend of Europe's shift to the right?\n\nThe expected shift to a center-left Labour government in Britain bucks the trend in Europe, as far-right parties have been on the rise across the continent in recent years.\n\nIn the first round of voting in France's parliamentary elections on Sunday, Marine Le Pen's far-right, anti-immigration National Rally Party moved within reach of becoming the largest political party in France. The party took a third of the votes in a first round that drew a historically high turnout.\n\nIf voters maintain that trend in the decisive second round of voting on July 7, it will mark an unprecedented shift to the right for the French.\n\nLast month's European parliamentary elections also saw a record number of far-right legislators win seats, with right wing candidates across Europe's three main economies \u2014 Italy, France and Germany \u2014 making gains by campaigning on opposition to issues including immigration, support for Ukraine and green environmental policies.\n\nWhile a Labour victory would be a move against those political winds on the continent, Britain has also seen a surge in support for far-right candidates in this election cycle.\n\nNigel Farage may be familiar to Americans as an ally of former President Donald Trump. His firebrand anti-immigrant rhetoric became hugely influential in the movement that led to Britain's \"Brexit\" from the European Union.\n\nAfter decades languishing on the far-right fringe of British politics, unable to win a seat in Parliament despite eight previous attempts, Farage looks set this year to finally claim the seat for his local constituency of Clacton, in southeast England.\n\nA photo posted by British politician Nigel Farage on Nov. 12, 2016 shows him standing with Donald Trump at Trump Tower in Manhattan after a private meeting with the then-U.S. president-elect. Nigel Farage/Twitter\n\nFarage's far-right Reform Party is only projected to pick up a total of about five seats in Parliament, including Farage's own, but YouGov projects overall support for Reform nationally at about 15% of the electorate, and from its current position with zero seats in the House of Commons, it seems the party is heading for a significant increase in popularity.\n\nPolitical analysts say Reform's anti-immigrant messaging is largely eating into the Conservative Party's vote share.\n\nSo while Farage won't be taking power anytime soon, it looks like he is about to step back into the limelight of British politics and, with a sizable share of public support, he may find himself wielding an outsized influence on the politics of Britain's Conservative Party as it tries to rebuild itself in the wake of what could be a devastating election.\n\nCBS News' Frank Andrews contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Iran holds runoff presidential vote pitting hard-liner against reformist after record low turnout\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 Iran held a runoff presidential election on Friday that pitted a hard-line former nuclear negotiator against a reformist lawmaker after the first round of voting saw the lowest turnout in the Islamic Republic\u2019s history.\n\nInitial results early Saturday put reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian ahead of hard-liner Saeed Jalili, though it wasn\u2019t clear how many people voted in the contest.\n\nGovernment officials up to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei predicted a higher participation rate as voting got underway, with state television airing images of modest lines at some polling centers across the country.\n\nHowever, online videos purported to show some polls empty while a survey of several dozen sites in the capital, Tehran, saw light traffic amid a heavy security presence on the streets.\n\nPolls closed after midnight, after voting was repeatedly extended by authorities as is tradition in Iran. Mohsen Eslami, an election spokesman, said Pezeshkian had 8.6 million votes, leading Jalili\u2019s 7.5 million. He gave no total turnout figure as counting continued through the night.\n\nKhamenei has insisted the low turnout from the first round on June 28 did not represent a referendum on Iran\u2019s Shiite theocracy. However, many remain disillusioned as Iran has been beset by years under crushing economic sanctions, bloody security force crackdowns on mass protests and tensions with the West over Tehran\u2019s advancing nuclear program enriching uranium closer than ever to weapons-grade levels.\n\n\u201cI want to save the country from isolation we are stuck in, and from lies and the violence against women because Iranian women don\u2019t deserve to be beaten up and insulted on the street by extremists who want to destroy the country by cutting ties with big countries,\u201d voter Ghazaal Bakhtiari said. \u201cWe should have ties with America and powerful nations.\u201d\n\nJalili has a recalcitrant reputation among Western diplomats during negotiations over Iran\u2019s nuclear program, something that is paired with concern at home over his hard-line views on Iran\u2019s mandatory headscarf, or hijab. Pezeshkian, a heart surgeon, has campaigned on relaxing hijab enforcement and reaching out to the West, though he too for decades has supported Khamenei and Iran\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard.\n\nPezeshkian\u2019s supporters have been warning Jalili will bring a \u201cTaliban\u201d-style government into Tehran, while Jalili has criticized Pezeshkian for running a campaign of fear-mongering.\n\nBoth contenders voted Friday in southern Tehran, home to many poor neighborhoods. Though Pezeshkian came out on top in the first round of voting on June 28, Jalili has been trying to secure the votes of people who supported hard-line parliamentary speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, who came in third and later endorsed the former negotiator.\n\nPezeshkian offered no comments after voting, walking out with former Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, who struck Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. A rambunctious crowd surrounded the men, shouting: \u201cThe nation\u2019s hope comes!\u201d\n\nBoth Pezeshkian and Jalili hope to replace the 63-year-old late President Ebrahim Raisi died in a May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country\u2019s foreign minister and several other officials.\n\nJalili voted at another polling station, surrounded by a crowd shouting: \u201cRaisi, your way continues!\u201d\n\n\u201cToday the entire world admits that it\u2019s the people who decide who\u2019s president for the next four years,\u201d Jalili said afterward. \u201cThis is your right to decide which person, which path and which approach should rule the country in the next four years.\u201d\n\nBut as has been the case since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women and those calling for radical change have been barred from the ballot while the vote itself had no oversight from internationally recognized monitors. The country\u2019s Interior Ministry, in charge of police, oversees the result.\n\nThere have been calls for a boycott, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi, though potential voters in Iran appear to have made the decision not to participate last week on their own as there\u2019s no widely accepted opposition movement operating within or outside of the country.\n\nKhamenei cast one of the election\u2019s first votes Friday from his residence, TV cameras and photographers capturing him dropping the ballot into the box. He insisted those who didn\u2019t vote last week were not boycotting the government.\n\n\u201cI have heard that people\u2019s enthusiasm is more than before,\u201c Khamenei said. \u201cGod willing, people vote and choose the best\u201d candidate.\n\nOne voter, 27-year-old Yaghoub Mohammadi, said he voted for Jalili in both rounds.\n\n\u201cHe is clean, without depending on powerful people in the establishment,\u201d Mohammadi said. \u201cHe represents those who have no access to power.\u201d\n\nBy Friday night, both hard-line and reformist figures urged the public to vote as lines remained light in Tehran.\n\n\u201cUntil a few hours ago I was reluctant to vote,\u201d said Ahmad Safari, a 55-year-old shopkeeper and father of three daughters who voted despite skipping the first round. \u201cBut I decided to vote for Pezeshkian because of my children. Maybe they\u2019ll have a better future.\u201d\n\nThe vote comes as wider tensions have gripped the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. In April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel over the war in Gaza, while militia groups that Tehran arms in the region \u2014 such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels \u2014 are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks.\n\nIran also continues to enrich uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build several nuclear weapons, should it choose to do so. And while Khamenei remains the final decision-maker on matters of state, whichever man ends up winning the presidency could bend the country\u2019s foreign policy toward either confrontation or collaboration with the West.\n\nMore than 61 million Iranians over the age of 18 were eligible to vote, with about 18 million of them between 18 to 30. Voting was to end at 6 p.m. but was extended until midnight to boost participation.\n\nRaisi, who died in the May helicopter crash, was seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Khamenei and a potential successor as supreme leader.\n\nStill, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf, or hijab.\n\n___\n\nKarimi reported from Tehran, Iran.

        "text": "2024 presidential election: See how LDS, other religious groups\u2019 views on Biden have shifted\nJoe Biden may be the most religiously observant U.S. president in generations \u2014 a good thing for the devout Catholic who may need a Hail Mary to improve his standing with voters of faith between now and November\u2019s election.\n\nAccording to data collected by the Cooperative Election Study, the 46th president has lost ground among adherents of nearly every major religious group \u2014 Latter-day Saints in particular \u2014 since 2021.\n\nThat year, nearly a third of U.S. members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints said they approved of Biden\u2019s job as president. By 2023, that number had dropped to 1 in 5, a shift that could spell trouble for the incumbent in, say, the swing state of Arizona, home to more than 442,000 Latter-day Saints.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to look at these numbers and point to any religious group that feels more warmly toward President Biden today than they did back in 2021,\u201d Ryan Burge, associate professor of political science at Eastern Illinois University, said in his weekly newsletter summarizing the survey data. \u201cThere are some that have held steady, but none that are clearly trending in his direction.\u201d\n\nLatter-day Saints and Biden\n\nPresident Joe Biden's approval rating with religious groups\n\nThat Biden\u2019s approval rating has slumped among the country\u2019s religious groups is, in and of itself, unremarkable. The incumbent has been underwater nationwide since fall 2021.\n\nThe real question, Notre Dame\u2019s David Campbell said, is why the plunge \u2014 11 percentage points \u2014 has been so steep with Latter-day Saints. Indeed, only Muslims, at 12 percentage points, saw a bigger decline in that period.\n\n(Both of those shifts fell outside the survey\u2019s margins of error of 7.8 percentage points for Latter-day Saints and 9 percentage points for Muslims.)\n\nCampbell believes the answer has to do with the other guy.\n\n\u201cLatter-day Saints have never been very supportive of [former President Donald] Trump,\u201d the political scientist said. \u201cHe\u2019s always struggled [with them], at least compared to other heavily Republican [religious] groups.\u201d\n\n(Kenny Holston | The New York Times) Former President Donald Trump speaks during the first 2024 presidential election debate with President Joe Biden at CNN's headquarters in Atlanta, on Thursday, June 27, 2024. The former president and convicted felon has always \"struggled\" with Latter-day Saint voters when compared to other Republican-heavy religious groups, political scientist David Campbell said.\n\nGiven this, he posited that Latter-day Saints were probably more likely to have given Biden the thumbs-up in 2021 when the Trump presidency was still top of mind. As time passed and the memory faded, however, their answers likely began to better reflect their true feelings about Biden, not Biden in comparison to Trump.\n\n\u201cThey are moving back to what we would expect from a heavily Republican group,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter all, you\u2019re asking them about a Democratic president and one who has not been especially popular.\u201d\n\nMuslims and Biden\n\nWhen asked what she thought was hurting Biden\u2019s standing among Muslims, Satin Tashnizi, executive director of Emerald Project, a nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting and empowering young Muslims, didn\u2019t hesitate.\n\nThe community, she said, feels \u201cincredibly betrayed\u201d by the current commander in chief and his handling of the \u201cgenocide of Palestinians\u201d in Gaza, including the ongoing shipment of arms to Israel.\n\n(Satin Tashnizi) Satin Tashnizi, co-founder and executive director of the Emerald Project, believes many American Muslims feel \u201cincredibly betrayed\u201d by President Joe Biden due to his ongoing support of Israel despite widespread casualties in Gaza.\n\n\u201c[As a candidate,] Biden expressed a lot of support for the Muslim community and talked about how Trump\u2019s Islamophobic policies were unacceptable,\u201d Tashnizi said. \u201cIt\u2019s now crystal clear that there\u2019s an inherent lack of value for Palestinian life.\u201d\n\nOf course, not all Palestinians are Muslims (and Muslims, Tashnizi stressed, \u201cdon\u2019t only care about other Muslims\u201d). But the fact that the overwhelming majority are means their suffering feels deeply personal, especially among those with relatives in Gaza.\n\n\u201cOur president,\u201d she said, \u201cis signing off on bomb shipments to kill people who are our family members. It\u2019s soul-crushing.\u201d\n\nJewish survey respondents, in contrast, logged a 1-point decrease in their view of Biden between 2021 and 2023 \u2014 well within the group\u2019s margin of error of 5.3 percentage points.\n\nWhat it all means for the 2024 election\n\nIn traditional campaign years, pollsters do not generally look to Latter-day Saints and Muslims to sway elections. But if 2024 looks anything like 2020, then the final result could come down to thin margins in places like Arizona and Michigan, home to sizable populations of Latter-day Saints and Muslims, respectively.\n\nEven more worrisome for Biden, however, is the 9-point decline in approval among one of the most consequential religious groups of the 81-year-old\u2019s victory almost four years ago: Black Protestants. These historically reliable Democrats are widely believed to have been pivotal in securing Biden not only his first term but also the 2020 nomination.\n\n\u201cLoss of enthusiasm for Joe Biden among Black Protestants,\u201d Campbell said, \u201ccould be devastating for the Biden campaign.\u201d\n\n(The survey\u2019s margin of error for this group was 3.5 percentage points.)\n\nOther liberal-leaning groups that also saw Biden\u2019s approval sink during the three-year period included atheists (down 9 points), non-white Catholics (down 7 points) and those who identify as \u201cnothing in particular,\u201d also known as \u201cnones\u201d (down 7 points).\n\nWhite Catholics, who have mostly leaned Republican in the past 40 years, ticked up 3 points, while mainline Protestants, one of the country\u2019s most politically diverse groups, held steady.\n\nNonetheless, at 39% and 43%, both groups \u201cjust don\u2019t like him very much,\u201d Burge writes. \u201cAnd do I need to remind anyone that Biden is a white Catholic?\u201d\n\n(The survey\u2019s error margins for these groups ranged from 1.7 percentage points to 3.3 percentage points.)\n\nPolls vs. votes\n\nThen again, Americans vote for candidates they\u2019re unenthusiastic about all the time.\n\n\u201cOn a survey, asking about presidential approval is different from asking who someone is going to vote for,\u201d said Lisa Argyle, a political scientist at LDS Church-owned Brigham Young University. \u201cIt\u2019s possible for someone to strongly like both candidates, or \u2014 as seems to be more common in this election cycle \u2014 to dislike both candidates. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily give us any clear indication of whom they are going to vote for.\u201d\n\n(Lisa Argyle) Lisa Argyle, assistant professor of political science at Brigham Young University and a faculty scholar with the Center for the Study of Elections and Democracy, said just because people disapprove of the sitting president doesn't mean they won't vote for the incumbent.\n\nStill, Argyle said, it\u2019s \u201cunlikely\u201d that Biden, who recently turned in a widely panned debate performance against Trump, now a convicted felon, will do better with Latter-day Saints in the upcoming election when compared with 2020, when a survey showed about 65% of U.S. members voted for the GOP nominee.\n\nFor her part, Tashnizi said she plans to vote for a third-party candidate this fall after casting her ballot for Biden in 2020.\n\n\u201cI just can\u2019t do it,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt\u2019s not political; it\u2019s visceral. Voting for Biden [or Trump] feels like betraying your bloodline.\u201d",

        "text": "Commentary: Under Biden or Trump, the US will be an increasingly unreliable partner in Asia\nThe Trump immunity ruling potentially revolutionises the US president\u2019s accountability before the law. The Court has stipulated that the president now has \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d for \u201cofficial acts\u201d performed in his capacity as president. \u201cOfficial acts\u201d are left undefined, ensuring plenty of future litigation about what is and isn\u2019t \u201cofficial\u201d.\n\nBut it appears to effectively put the president above the law while in office. Trump\u2019s lawyers even argued that the president could execute a political rival as an \u201cofficial act\u201d. This contradicts the spirit of the American Revolution and the framing of the US Constitution which explicitly sought to limit executive, monarchical power.\n\nHad this holding existed in 1972, for example, the Watergate investigation of former US president Richard Nixon would likely not have been possible. There is widespread anxiety over how Trump would use this latitude if he returns to office next year.\n\nTRUMP AND TURMOIL\n\nA return of Trump to the US presidency promises substantial turmoil in US domestic politics, worsening US foreign policy confusion.\n\nAt home, Trump has promised an angry, vengeful return to the presidency. He has spoken of jailing his opponents, a massive crackdown on illegal immigration and urban crime, and using government agencies against perceived liberal critics like the media and academia.\n\nThis will likely activate widespread resistance, as it did in his first term. But this time the stakes will be higher and the conflict sharper. Protests and street violence seem likely.\n\nThis domestic chaos will distract Washington and wash into US foreign policy. Many Trump domestic initiatives will land in court and his administration will face protest and resistance from the start, making it even harder to focus Trump on foreign policy.",

        "text": "How the 2024 election could have looked with proportional representation\nBut what if we had used the same electoral system they use for the Scottish and Welsh Parliaments instead? With the Additional Member System (AMS) you choose a constituency candidate and have a second vote for your preferred party to represent you regionally. You can cast both votes for the same party or vote for different parties in your constituency and regional ballots. Regional seats are then allocated to parties on a proportional basis, taking into account the constituency MPs each party won.\n\nIt is important to note from the outset that it is impossible to predict with certainty what electoral results under different voting systems would be. This projection is merely an indication of what the results of this general election \u2013 conducted under FPTP \u2013 could have looked like using a different electoral system.\n\nIt is of course impossible to account for the other changes that would accompany a switch to an alternative electoral system, such as changes in voter behaviour, party campaigning, or the number of parties standing candidates.\n\nOur projection shows a result that is more in line with how we voted at the 2024 general election. Based on our projection, the Labour Party is still the largest party, but more in line with their percentage of the vote.\n\nWhile Labour have fewer seats, the Conservatives, Liberal Democrats, SNP, Green Party and Reform UK have shares far closer to their share of the vote.\n\nNo government should be able to win a big majority on a minority of the vote. Westminster\u2019s voting system is warping our politics and we\u2019re all paying the price. Under a proportional voting system, seats more closely match votes, so we can all have more impact on what happens in Westminster.",

        "text": "Meet the Democrats seen as up-and-comers for 2028 \u2014 or maybe sooner\nPresident Biden is adamant that he will continue his 2024 reelection bid \u2014 despite calls from some Democrats to consider dropping out because they\u2019re worried his dismal debate performance last week means the party will lose in November.\n\nRep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, was the first congressional Democrat to publicly call on Biden to step aside. Other leaders in the party have said Biden is best placed to take on former President Donald Trump.\n\nBut overall, the conversation has brought up a key question for the party: if not Biden, then who?\n\nSeveral Democrats believed to have presidential ambitions for the 2028 election have now been thrown into the spotlight as potential Biden replacements for 2024 \u2014 though all of them have declared they support the president\u2019s run.\n\nDemocratic operatives like Adrianne Shropshire, who leads BlackPAC, have said taking Biden off the top of the ticket is a bad idea for these contenders now \u2014 and in the future.\n\n\u201cWhat they don\u2019t want to do is find themselves in a place four years from now, eight years from now, when they\u2019re trying to run, and Americans, including Democrats, have lost confidence in the party itself to manage itself,\u201d Shropshire said.\n\nHere\u2019s a list of some of the names being floated:\n\nVice President Kamala Harris\n\nAlready number two on the ticket, there are several current and former Democratic leaders who have said Harris is the obvious, and only, choice to replace Biden. Harris, 59, has a national profile and name recognition that other contenders wouldn\u2019t have time to build before November.\n\nShe\u2019s been a consistently high fundraiser for Biden and the party. She has also been traveling more for the campaign, with events aimed at engaging with voters of color, younger voters and women \u2014 especially on issues of reproductive rights, a focal point for the Biden campaign since the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs ruling in 2022.\n\nHarris, like Biden, has struggled with low approval ratings. Early on as vice president, she stumbled in her handling of the root causes of migration. But she has built up her foreign policy chops. Some in the party like close Biden ally Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., and progressive Rep. Summer Lee, D-Pa., have said they would back Harris if Biden were to step aside.\n\nHarris, though, has not wavered in supporting Biden, telling a CBS reporter this week, \u201cJoe Biden is our nominee. We beat Trump once and we are going to beat him again.\u201d\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom\n\nA former mayor of San Francisco, Newsom, 56, is in his second term as governor \u2014 surviving a recall election in 2021. He is known for his progressive policies, including prisoner rehabilitation, public safe drug-use clinics for overdose patients and new legal strategies to promote gun control.\n\nNewsom has long been an adversary to conservatives, debating Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis last year in a primetime debate on Fox News. He has worked to raise his profile with trips around the country, as well as to Israel and China.\n\nThere have been some scandals in his political career dating back before his first gubernatorial run in 2008, but he remains a top party leader who has remained loyal to Biden, and helping raise money for the campaign. After the presidential debate in Atlanta, Newsom was in the spin room for the Biden campaign, defending the president.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer\n\nWhitmer, a co-chair of the Biden campaign, gained national attention during the COVID-19 pandemic with strict lockdown guidelines. Three men were later convicted for supporting a plot to kidnap her because of her COVID policies.\n\nAs governor of a critical swing state, Whitmer has championed gun safety legislation, electric car manufacturing and abortion rights. Whitmer, 52, has repeatedly pledged her support for Biden in 2024. Her forthcoming political memoir, \u201cTrue Gretch,\u201d will be released this July, and may boost her national profile further.",

        "text": "Defiant Biden says no intention to exit presidential race in TV interview\nUS president says his recent debacle in a televised debate with Donald Trump was due to \u2018exhaustion\u2019 and a \u2018bad cold\u2019.\n\nUnited States President Joe Biden has used a much-anticipated interview with ABC News to reiterate that he is the candidate to beat Donald Trump in November\u2019s presidential election, again describing his recent disastrous debate as \u201ca bad episode\u201d.\n\nBiden, 81, told ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos in a taped interview that aired on Friday evening that he has \u201ca cognitive test every single day\u201d, referring to the tasks he faces daily as president.\n\n\u201cEvery day, I\u2019ve had tests. Everything I do,\u201d he said. \u201cI just had a bad night. I don\u2019t know why.\u201d\n\nStephanopoulos asked whether the debate debacle \u201cwas a bad episode or a sign of a more serious condition\u201d.\n\nHe also questioned whether Biden was being realistic in his belief that he could beat Trump, 78, given the gap opening in opinion polls between the two candidates and growing concern among Democrats that Biden should step aside.\n\nA recent Reuters/Ipsos poll found that one in three Democrats want Biden to quit the race.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone is more qualified,\u201d Biden said in the interview, blaming his June 27 debate performance on exhaustion and a \u201creally bad cold\u201d.\n\nThe polls, Biden said, were inaccurate.\n\nAsked whether he was more frail, Biden said, \u201cNo\u201d.\n\nAsked also whether he would drop out if fellow Democrats in Congress said he was hurting their re-election chances in November, Biden said: \u201cIf the Lord Almighty comes out and tells me that, I might do that.\u201d\n\nThe 22-minute interview, which ABC said was not cut or edited, was being closely watched by Democrats concerned about the president\u2019s ability to serve another four years, or beat Trump, a Republican, in the election.\n\nYet even before it aired in full, the interview seemed to do little to assuage Americans\u2019 worries about Biden\u2019s age and fitness to stand for election.\n\nReporting from Washington, DC, on Saturday, Al Jazeera\u2019s Mike Hanna said the general takeaway from the ABC News interview is that Biden \u201cdidn\u2019t make any mistakes, but equally, that he didn\u2019t necessarily convince those who were doubting his ability to govern in the future\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere is support for Biden among many Democrats,\u201d Hanna said. \u201cThere are some who reportedly are concerned and are \u2026 trying to move him out.\u201d\n\nA handful of Democratic Party donors and business leaders are making their displeasure with Biden\u2019s candidacy known loudly, halting funding or looking at possible alternative candidates.\n\nI\u2019ve seen enough: It hard to imagine this good man beating Trump and serving four more years in the most demanding job on earth. You see it too, Biden Dems. You\u2019ve seen it for months. You\u2019re doing your boss and your country a grave disservice. https://t.co/E2UN4Fvgl4 \u2014 Ron Fournier (@ron_fournier) July 5, 2024\n\nSome of Biden\u2019s closest political allies, including top Democrat and former House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have raised questions about his health.\n\n\u201cIt hard to imagine this good man beating Trump and serving four more years in the most demanding job on earth,\u201d Ron Fournier, a former White House correspondent, said on social media alongside a clip of the ABC interview.\n\nMassachusetts Governor Maura Healey, the rare Democratic governor not to come out in support of the president in recent days, in a statement on Friday asked Biden to weigh his decision to run carefully.\n\n\u201cPresident Biden saved our democracy in 2020 and has done an outstanding job over the last four years,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe best way forward right now is a decision for the president to make. Over the coming days, I urge him to listen to the American people and carefully evaluate whether he remains our best hope to defeat Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday morning, Democratic Congresswoman Angie Craig also directly called on Biden to nix his re-election campaign.\n\n\u201cI do not believe that the President can effectively campaign and win against Donald Trump,\u201d Craig said in a statement, adding that \u201cthere is too much at stake to risk a second Donald Trump presidency\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I respectfully call on President Biden to step aside as the Democratic nominee for a second term as President and allow for a new generation of leaders to step forward.\u201d",

While he has refused to step down and informed his supporters that his campaign shall continue, there are a growing number of Democrats who point out that the president\u2019s health and his disastrous performance in the first presidential debate are concerns that can no longer be ignored. In such a scenario, the party is building a consensus around Vice-President Kamala Harris . Though she is trailing behind Trump , party insiders point out that she has the ability to defeat him in the months ahead.Kamala Harris, according to many Democrats is the best person to replace Biden on the ballot box. She has served as an Attorney in California and is articulate on many issues. She has been taking on Trump on the issue of Abortion rights and other legal issues. She lashed out at Trump and said that he would use the Department of Justice to go after his political opponents, if he wins the election.She has been actively involved in the election and has been campaigning across the country. As compared to other Democrats such as Gavin Newsom, her fellow Californian, she has a nation-wide appeal and is a known face in many of the critical states. It is believed that she has the ability to win across many states.After Biden\u2019s cognitive decline, many have also started looking for a younger candidate. Biden is 81 and Trump is 78. In comparison, the Vice-President is only 59-years-old. She also has the support among the Blacks, Youth and Women. Presently, the Democrats are looking to shore up their support among these sections of the voters and Harris may the perfect candidate for it.Presently, she has wider support among the Women, Youth and the Blacks as compared to Trump who has the greater support among the members of the Hispanic community.Kamala Harris may not have the political acumen to contest the presidential election. She had earlier pulled out of the Democratic Party primaries in 2020 even before the first vote was cast. She has also expressed her support for Biden\u2019s re-election campaign.California Governor Gavin Newsom is one of the candidates who may replace Biden. However, VP Kamala Harris is emerging as the strongest candidate in the race.The Constitution declares the Vice-President to be the President of the Senate. They also preside over the office of the President if there any vacancies.",

        "text": "Biden dismisses age questions in interview as he tries to salvage reelection effort\nMADISON, Wis. (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden, fighting to save his endangered reelection effort, used a highly anticipated TV interview to repeatedly reject taking an independent medical evaluation that would show voters he is up for serving another term in office while blaming his disastrous debate performance on a \u201cbad episode\u201d and saying there were \u201cno indications of any serious condition.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, I have a cognitive test every single day,\u201d Biden told ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos, referring to the tasks he faces daily in a rigorous job. \u201cEvery day, I have that test. Everything I do. You know, not only am I campaigning, but I\u2019m running the world.\u201d\n\nThe 81-year-old Biden made it through the 22-minute interview Friday without any major blunders that would inflict further damage to his imperiled candidacy. But it appeared unlikely to fully tamp down concerns about his age and fitness for another four years and his ability to defeat Donald Trump in November.\n\nOn Saturday, another Democratic lawmaker joined close to a half dozen in saying Biden should not run again. Rep. Angie Craig of Minnesota said that given what she saw and heard in the debate, and Biden\u2019s \u201clack of a forceful response\u201d afterward, he should step aside \u201cand allow for a new generation of leaders to step forward.\u201d\n\nCraig posted one of the Democrats\u2019 key suburban wins in the 2018 midterms and could be a barometer for districts that were vital for Biden in 2020.\n\nThe interview left Biden in a standoff against a not-insignificant faction of his party with four months to go until Election Day, and with just weeks until the Democratic National Convention. The drawn-out spectacle could benefit Biden\u2019s efforts to remain in the race by limiting the party\u2019s options to replace him. But it also could be a distraction from vital efforts to frame the 2024 race as a referendum on Trump.\n\nDuring the interview, Biden insisted he was not more frail than earlier in his presidency. He said he undergoes \u201congoing assessment\u201d by his personal doctors and they \u201cdon\u2019t hesitate to tell me\u201d if something is wrong.\n\n\u201cCan I run the 100 in 10 flat? No. But I\u2019m still in good shape,\u201d Biden said.\n\nAs for the debate, \u201cI didn\u2019t listen to my instincts in terms of preparing,\u201d Biden said.\n\nBiden suggested that Trump\u2019s disruptions \u2014 from just a few feet away \u2014 had flustered him: \u201cI realized that, even when I was answering a question and they turned his mic off, he was still shouting and I let it distract me. I\u2019m not blaming it on that. But I realized that I just wasn\u2019t in control.\u201d\n\nAt times, Biden rambled during the interview, which ABC said aired in full and without edits. At one point, he started to explain his debate performance, then veered to a New York Times poll, then pivoted to the lies Trump told during the debate. Biden also referred to the midterm \u201cred wave\u201d as occurring in 2020, rather than 2022.\n\nAsked how he might turn the race around, Biden argued that one key would be large and energetic rallies like the one he held Friday in Wisconsin. When reminded that Trump routinely draws larger crowds, the president laid into his opponent.\n\n\u201cTrump is a pathological liar,\u201d Biden said, accusing Trump of bungling the federal response to the COVID pandemic and failing to create jobs. \u201cYou ever see something that Trump did that benefited someone else and not him?\u201d\n\nThe interview, paired with a weekend campaign in battleground Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, was part of Biden\u2019s rigorous effort to course correct from his rocky debate performance. But internal party frustrations continue to fester, with one influential Democratic senator working on a nascent push to encourage the president to exit the race and Democrats quietly chatting about where they would go next if the president drops out \u2014 or what it would mean if he stays in.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s President Biden\u2019s decision whether or not he remains in the race. Voters select our nominee and they chose him,\u201d said California Rep. Ro Khanna, a member of the Biden campaign\u2019s national advisory board that works as a gathering of his top surrogates. \u201cNow, he needs to prove to those voters that he is up to the job and that will require more than just this one interview.\u201d\n\nOne Democrat who watched said they found Biden to be still shaky under controlled conditions and predicted more will call on him to leave the race.\n\nStill, in Wisconsin, Biden was focused on proving his capacity to serve another term. When asked whether he would halt his campaign, he told reporters he was \u201ccompletely ruling that out\u201d and said he is \u201cpositive\u201d he could serve another four years. At a rally in front of hundreds of supporters he acknowledged his subpar debate performance but insisted, \u201cI am running, and I\u2019m going to win again.\u201d\n\nWhile private angst among Democratic lawmakers, donors and strategists has been running deep since the debate, most in the party have held public fire as they wait to see if the president can restore confidence with his weekend travel and his handling of the interview. Top Biden campaign officials were texting lawmakers encouraging them to refrain from public comments about the situation and give the president a chance to respond, according to a Democrat granted anonymity to discuss the situation.\n\nTo that end, Sen. Mark Warner reached out to fellow senators throughout this week to discuss whether to ask Biden to exit the race, according to three people familiar with the effort who requested anonymity to talk about private conversations. The Virginia Democrat\u2019s moves are notable given his chairmanship of the Senate Intelligence Committee and his reputation as a lawmaker who is supportive of Biden and has working relationships with colleagues in both parties. Warner\u2019s effort was first reported by The Washington Post.\n\nThe strategy remains fluid. One of the people with knowledge of Warner\u2019s effort said there are enough Senate Democrats concerned enough about Biden\u2019s capacity to run for reelection to take some sort of action, although there was yet no consensus on what that plan would be. Some of the Democratic senators could meet as soon as Monday on how to move forward.\n\nThe top Democrats on House committees are planning to meet virtually Sunday to discuss the situation, according to a person familiar with the gathering granted anonymity to talk about it.\n\nAt least five House Democrats have called for Biden to step down as the nominee. While not going that far, Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey said in a carefully worded statement Friday that Biden now has a decision to make on \u201cthe best way forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cI urge him to listen to the American people and carefully evaluate whether he remains our best hope to defeat Donald Trump,\u201d Healey said.\n\nIn the interview, Biden was asked how he might be persuaded to leave the race. He laughed and replied, \u201cIf the Lord Almighty comes down and tells me that, I might do that.\u201d\n\nThere were also a few signs of discontent at Biden\u2019s campaign rally Friday, with one person onstage waving a sign that read \u201cPass the torch Joe\u201d as the president came out. His motorcade was also greeted at the middle school by a few people urging him to move on.\n\nBut Rebecca Green, a 52-year-old environmental scientist from Madison, said she found Biden\u2019s energy reassuring. \u201cWe were just waiting for him to come out strong and fighting again, the way we know he is.\u201d\n\nMany Democratic lawmakers, who are hearing from constituents at home during the holiday week, are deeply frustrated and split on whether Biden should stay or go. Privately, discussions among the House Democrats flared this week as word spread that some of them were drafting public letters suggesting the president should quit the race.\n\nBiden appears to have pulled his family closer while attempting to prove that he\u2019s still the Democrats\u2019 best option.\n\nThe ubiquitous presence of Hunter Biden in the West Wing since the debate has become an uncomfortable dynamic for many staffers, according to two Democrats close to the White House who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter.\n\nFor many staffers, the sight of Hunter Biden, just weeks after his conviction on felony gun charges, taking a larger role in advising his father has been unsettling and a questionable choice, they said.\n\nIn a hastily organized gathering with more than 20 Democratic governors Wednesday evening, Biden acknowledged he needs to sleep more and limit evening events so he can be rested for the job. In trying to explain away those comments, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre stressed that Biden \u201cworks around the clock\u201d but that he \u201calso recognizes the importance of striking a balance and taking care of himself.\u201d\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who attended the meeting, said Biden \u201ccertainly engaged with us on complicated matters.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut then again, this is something that he needs to not just reassure Democratic governors on, but he needs to reassure the American people,\u201d Beshear said.\n\n___\n\nKim reported from Washington.

        "text": "Moderate Masoud Pezeshkian wins Iran's presidential runoff election\nReformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian won Iran's runoff presidential election Saturday, besting hard-liner Saeed Jalili by promising to reach out to the West and ease enforcement on the country's mandatory headscarf law after years of sanctions and protests squeezing the Islamic Republic.\n\nPezeshkian promised no radical changes to Iran's Shiite theocracy in his campaign and long has held Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as the final arbiter of all matters of state in the country. But even Pezeshkian's modest aims will be challenged by an Iranian government still largely held by hard-liners, the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, and Western fears over Tehran enriching uranium to near-weapons-grade levels.\n\nA vote count offered by authorities put Pezeshkian as the winner with 16.3 million votes to Jalili's 13.5 million in Friday's election.\n\nIranian reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian speaks at his rally for the presidential elections in Tehran, Iran, on July 3, 2024. Fatemeh Bahrami/Anadolu via Getty Images\n\nSupporters of Pezeshkian, a heart surgeon and longtime lawmaker, entered the streets of Tehran and other cities before dawn to celebrate as his lead grew over Jalili, a hard-line former nuclear negotiator.\n\nBut Pezeshkian's win still sees Iran at a delicate moment, with tensions high in the Mideast over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, Iran's advancing nuclear program, and a looming U.S. election that could put any chance of a detente between Tehran and Washington at risk.\n\nThe first round of voting June 28 saw the lowest turnout in the history of the Islamic Republic since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Iranian officials have long pointed to turnout as a sign of support for the country's Shiite theocracy, which has been under strain after years of sanctions crushing Iran's economy, mass demonstrations and intense crackdowns on all dissent.\n\nGovernment officials up to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei predicted a higher participation rate as voting got underway, with state television airing images of modest lines at some polling centers across the country.\n\nHowever, online videos purported to show some polls empty while a survey of several dozen sites in the capital, Tehran, saw light traffic amid a heavy security presence on the streets.\n\nThe election came amid heightened regional tensions. In April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel over the war in Gaza, while militia groups that Tehran arms in the region \u2014 such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels \u2014 are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks.\n\nIran is also enriching uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build several nuclear weapons, should it choose to do so. And while Khamenei remains the final decision-maker on matters of state, whichever man ends up winning the presidency could bend the country's foreign policy toward either confrontation or collaboration with the West.\n\nThe campaign also repeatedly touched on what would happen if former President Donald Trump, who unilaterally withdrew America from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018, won the November election. Iran has held indirect talks with President Joe Biden's administration, though there's been no clear movement back toward constraining Tehran's nuclear program for the lifting of economic sanctions.\n\nMore than 61 million Iranians over the age of 18 were eligible to vote, with about 18 million of them between 18 and 30. Voting was to end at 6 p.m. but was extended until midnight to boost participation.\n\nThe late President Ebrahim Raisi, who died in a May helicopter crash, was seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Khamenei and a potential successor as supreme leader.\n\nStill, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf, or hijab.",

        "text": "Reformist Masoud Pezeshkian wins Iran presidential election\nThe reformist Masoud Pezeshkian has pulled off a stunning victory in the Iranian presidential runoff, reflecting deep dissatisfaction with the direction of the country in recent years and opening potential new avenues of cooperation with the west.\n\nPezeshkian won 16,384,403 votes to defeat the ultra-conservative Saeed Jalili, who received 13,538,179 votes, on a final turnout of 49.8% \u2013 a big increase on the record low turnout of 39% recorded in the first round. In the first round, Pezeshkian came top, defeating three Conservative rivals. The turnout included more than 1m invalid votes.\n\nPezeshkian has been an advocate of letting women choose whether to wear the hijab and ending internet restrictions that require the population to use VPN connections to avoid government censorship. He said after his victory: \u201cThe difficult path ahead will not be smooth except with your companionship, empathy and trust.\u201d\n\nUnder the slogan \u201cFor Iran\u201d, Pezeshkian had promised to be a voice of the voiceless, saying protests must not be met with the police baton. Although some regard him as naive in high politics, a large part of his campaign was deliberately framed around his personal integrity, as well as his absence from ministerial office for the past decade. There were immediate calls from his backers to release political prisoners from jails, a symbol of the pent-up demands he may struggle to satisfy.\n\nPezeshkian faces a minefield in trying to bring about change, and although he has said he is loyal to Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, he has also said he will resign if he feels he is being thwarted, and will then call on the population to withdraw from the political process.\n\nThe precise powers of the president in the field of foreign policy are disputed, but Pezeshkian argued in successive, often acrimonious TV debates that he could not bring about change, including the lowering of 40% inflation, unless he could secure the lifting of some sanctions, which would require a less confrontational approach to international relations.\n\nDuring the campaign, he said Iran had found itself inside an economic cage as a result of its foreign policy, and needed to be more cooperative to see if sanctions could be lifted.\n\nHis in effect running mate in the campaign had been the former foreign minister Javad Zarif, who negotiated the nuclear deal in 2015 that led to a lifting of sanctions before Donald Trump pulled the US out of the plan in 2018.\n\nZarif said sanctions meant Iran had been bypassed. The stock market rose on the news of the reformist victory.\n\nJalili, a former nuclear negotiator close to the supreme leader, had claimed Iran could thrive by building stronger economic ties away from the west. Far from Iran being a cage, he said, Iran was a sanctuary.\n\nPezeshkian\u2019s victory is all the more remarkable since no reformist was allowed to stand in the last presidential election in 2021, and it was thought the high tide of Iranian reformism had long passed, with many voters convinced there was no point going to the polls since a \u201cshadow government\u201d took all the decisions.\n\nThe repression of the \u201cwomen, life, freedom\u201d protests in 2022 only added to a sense that the path to change through the ballot box was closed. Many senior reformists from the green movement as well as political prisoners inside Evin jail had called for a boycott.\n\nBut after Pezeshkian topped the first round \u2013 defying the rule of Iranian politics that reformists lose if turnout is low \u2013 his campaign team grew in confidence that he could win if more voters took part in the runoff.\n\nIt also became clear that supporters of the more centrist conservative Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf were not going to transfer their votes to Jalili, with whom they had sharp ideological differences. Zarif urged the abstentionists to vote, saying: \u201cThose who did not participate in the first round, you sent your message in the first period, now you must complete your message with your presence.\u201d\n\nAnother leading Pezeshkian backer, the former communications minister Mohammad-Javad Azari Jahromi, said: \u201cWe must prove the people are the people, not those who consider themselves guardians of the people.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday evening, reformists became nervous that a sudden surge in late votes was a sign of the regime seeking to rig the result, something it has been accused of doing before. There were reports that government funds were being used to send clerics into rural villages to solidify support in Jalili heartlands.\n\nBut then late on Saturday, government news channels leaked that Pezeshkian had won before the Iranian election headquarters declared him the official victor, sending his supporters into the streets of Tehran.\n\nAbout 5,000 had attended his final election rally in a football stadium in Tehran, suggesting his campaign might not have sparked the support he needed among abstentionists. After a quiet campaign in the capital, his jubilant supporters poured on to the streets of Tehran to celebrate a victory that few saw coming.\n\nIn parliamentary elections earlier this year marked by low turnout, the conservatives trounced reformists. Ghalibaf\u2019s authority as speaker of the parliament has, meanwhile, been weakened by his defeat in the presidential elections. The political complexion of the parliament will be one of the many obstacles facing the new president since it has the power to impeach ministers.\n\nThe first round of voting on 28 June had the lowest turnout in the history of the Islamic Republic since the 1979 revolution. Iranian officials have long pointed to turnout as a symbol of the legitimacy for the country\u2019s Shia theocracy, but Khamenei said those who stayed away from the polls had not done so due to opposition to the regime.\n\nThe snap presidential election was caused by the death of Ebrahim Raisi, the incumbent, in a helicopter crash in May. Raisi had been seen as a potential successor to the 85-year-old supreme leader, and his death has thrown that succession into disarray. The decision is taken by an 88-strong body, the assembly of experts.\n\nThe west will now have to make a judgment on whether to help Pezeshkian or maintain the blanket of sanctions due to the continued escalation of Iran\u2019s nuclear programme, and its support for Hezbollah in Lebanon and Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels.\n\nIran is enriching uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build several nuclear weapons, but does not yet have the warheads or missile technology.\n\nIt is also providing Russia with drones for use in Ukraine. Pezeshkian\u2019s second foreign policy adviser alongside Zarif was a former ambassador to Moscow, Mehdi Sanei.\n\nThe US state department said the election would not lead to any change in the US approach to Iran. The US officials pointed to the boycott of the elections by a large part of Iranian voters and wrote: \u201cThe elections in Iran were not free and fair. As a result, a significant number of Iranians chose not to participate at all.\u201d\n\nThe statement added: \u201cWe have no expectation that these elections will lead to a fundamental change in Iran\u2019s path or greater respect for the human rights of citizens. As the candidates themselves have said, Iran\u2019s policy is determined by the leader.\u201d",

        "text": "The United States and the Venezuelan Election\nIt would no doubt be wrong and unfair to argue that the Biden administration is seeking to undermine Venezuela\u2019s democratic opposition forces, but it\u2019s hard to escape entertaining that speculation this month.\n\nThe last meeting between U.S. and Maduro regime officials \u2013before this month- was in April. Since then the regime has worked hard to ensure that the July 28 presidential election is not fair. For example, it barred the leading opposition candidate, Maria Corina Machado, from running, and in May the regime revoked its invitation to the EU to observe the election. And as an article in Americas Quarterly noted, \u201cNicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s regime is also taking steps to block Venezuelans\u2019 access to ballot boxes at home and abroad.\u201d\n\nOn July 3rd, the EU issued a statement in which it \u201cexpresses its deep concern with the decisions intended to prevent members of the opposition from exercising their core political rights, as has been the case of Mar\u00eda Corina Machado and other political figures. These decisions undermine democracy and the rule of law and will only deepen the longstanding political and social crisis in Venezuela.\u201d\n\nPressure Points Abrams gives his take on U.S. foreign policy, with special focus on the Middle East and democracy and human rights issues.\n\nYet the United States sought a meeting with Maduro regime officials, and it was held (virtually) on July 3. To repeat, it was not Maduro who sought the meeting but the United States. Why? According to Reuters, a White House spokesman said of Wednesday's meeting that \"We discussed a wide range of issues and continued to urge competitive and inclusive elections on July 28 in Venezuela.\u201d\n\nUrging free elections on Nicolas Maduro is about as useful as urging them on Cuba\u2019s president. Meanwhile, the lawyer and scholar Rocio San Miguel, seized by police on February 9, remains in the hellish El Helicoide prison\u2014detained, as Amnesty International put it, \u201cfor defending human rights in Venezuela.\u201d One hopes, without much confidence, that among the \u201cwide range of issues\u201d raised in the U.S.-Maduro talks was her detention\u2014and that of hundreds of other political prisoners.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s oil production rose from around 400,000 barrels per day when President Biden entered office to double that today\u2014a period in which repression also grew steadily. During 2023, as Reuters reported, \u201cVenezuela's oil exports increased 12%...to almost 700,000 barrels per day (bpd) as the United States eased sanctions\u2026.\u201d Production increases continued in 2024, and \u201cUS oil giant Chevron, which received a limited license to reactivate extraction and sales from its Venezuelan operations in November 2022, recently announced plans to drill 30 new wells in the crude-rich Orinoco Oil Belt.\u201d\n\nWhy is this in the interest of the United States? With global crude oil production of over 80 million barrels per day, and total liquid fuels production over 100 million barrels per day, these Venezuelan increases in production will not affect U.S. and global oil prices, so any Biden administration thinking that concessions to Maduro will help keep U.S. gasoline prices down until the U.S. election is simply foolish. Equally foolish is the notion that such meetings with Maduro regime officials will produce improved human rights conditions or a free election.\n\nWhat they can do is undermine the democratic opposition. I wonder if the opposition was consulted by the Biden administration and asked if they thought holding such a meeting three weeks before the Venezuelan election was wise. I wonder if there was a serious meeting between U.S. officials and opposition leaders to discuss the positions U.S. officials would take with the regime: what priorities, what strategies? I wonder if there has been or will be a full report to the democratic opposition leaders as to what transpired between U.S. officials and Maduro\u2019s representatives. Given the Biden administration\u2019s treatment of the opposition in the last three and half years, one is entitled to harbor doubts.\n\nI will be delighted to withdraw all this criticism if the election on July 28 is remotely fair and the opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez is \u201cpermitted\u201d to win. Every poll shows him way ahead. Then the Biden administration can assist in a smooth transition back to democracy in Venezuela and critics like me will apologize. But it is far more likely that the regime will claim victory, and then what will the Biden administration do? Recognize the failure of its policies, reimpose sanctions, and seek to organize the democracies of Latin America and the rest of the world against the regime? Or will it slowly make its peace with Maduro, lifting more sanctions and eventually sending a U.S. ambassador back to Caracas and allowing Maduro to take over the Venezuelan embassy in Washington?\n\nThat\u2019s no doubt Maduro\u2019s thinking. Perhaps in the July 3 meeting, U.S. officials not only demanded a free election, but also spoke about transitions (accompanied by amnesties) that would ease Maduro and his cohorts out, and promised to launch a powerful new effort against the regime if it steals the election. Perhaps U.S. officials explained how a transition could be made to work, while theft of the election would bring down retribution. Perhaps--and I wish I believed that. But looking at the Biden administration\u2019s record on Venezuela over the last three and a half years, the signs unfortunately point in a different direction.",

        "text": "Analysis: There is no direct precedent for Biden dropping out now. Here\u2019s the history\nCNN \u2014\n\nIt is not unprecedented for an incumbent president to abandon his reelection campaign. But it is rare, and no president until President Joe Biden has been pressured out of a reelection campaign out of concerns about his mental fitness.\n\nOne warning bell for Democrats who assume that a nominee younger than Biden \u2013 he has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris \u2013 would do better against former President Donald Trump: Republicans won the two most recent elections in which presidents eligible for reelection bowed out of their campaigns.\n\nDemocrats Harry S. Truman and Lyndon B. Johnson were succeeded by Republicans. A more immediate problem for Democrats is that Biden\u2019s departure is the latest such decision in history.\n\nJohnson and Truman left under pressure, handed the White House over to the other party\n\nComparisons between Biden and any of these presidents are not perfect. Neither Truman nor Johnson faced serious questions about their ability to do the job. Biden does.\n\nBoth Johnson and Truman, like Biden, were former lawmakers and former vice presidents. Unlike Biden, both had assumed the presidency after a death or assassination. Both Johnson and Truman then won the White House in their own right.\n\nBut both Johnson and Truman faced competition for their party\u2019s nomination in 1952 and 1968 respectively. Both were embarrassed by a subpar showing in the New Hampshire primary, and both announced in the spring that they would not seek reelection.\n\nTruman made the announcement that he would not be running during a speech in Washington that was broadcast nationwide, while Johnson made his announcement in a televised address from the White House.\n\nBiden was never under any real pressure from Democrats to stand down earlier this year, and he faced only token opposition for the Democratic nomination. Nearly all of the delegates to the Democratic National Convention are pledged to him. In other words, Truman and Johnson both avoided a bruising primary by ending their reelection campaigns. Biden had the Democratic nomination sewn up, and he chose to give it up.\n\nRepublicans, with help from their war hero nominee Dwight Eisenhower, won the White House, the Senate and the House in 1952, when Truman decided not to run again. Johnson\u2019s decision not to run created a scramble for the Democratic nomination. Ultimately, Vice President Hubert Humphrey won the honor at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Humphrey would go on to lose the White House to Richard Nixon, but Democrats kept control of the House and the Senate.\n\nRoosevelt and Coolidge left on high notes, and their party kept the White House\n\nTheodore Roosevelt and Calvin Coolidge were Republicans who assumed the presidency after an assassination or death, and both chose to leave the presidency after serving one full term and most of another.\n\nRoosevelt later regretted his pledge not to run again in 1908. He left office extremely popular and well respected and handed the White House off to his hand-picked successor, fellow Republican William Howard Taft. But Roosevelt was so aggravated by Taft\u2019s performance and the direction of the GOP that he challenged Taft for the Republican nomination in the next presidential election.\ufeff When Roosevelt could not get the nomination at the GOP convention, he ran as a third-party Progressive, or Bull Moose, candidate and beat Taft at the ballot box, although both lost to Democrat Woodrow Wilson.\n\nCoolidge assumed the presidency when Warren G. Harding died of a heart attack in San Francisco. Coolidge then won the White House on his own. Never happy as president, he suffered loss during his time in office when his son died tragically after playing tennis at the White House. Coolidge also handed the presidency off to a fellow Republican, Herbert Hoover.\n\nCoolidge disclosed his decision not to run on handwritten strips of paper given to reporters during his summer vacation the year before the election. The curt statement \u2013 \u201cI do not choose to run for President in 1928\u201d \u2013 caught everyone by surprise.\n\nThree 19th-century presidents pledged to serve one term\n\nDespite an active and successful presidency, James K. Polk\u2019s Democrats lost the White House after he stepped aside from the 1848 election. The Whig Party ran a war hero, Zachary Taylor, and former President Martin Van Buren ran as a third-party candidate. Taylor won, taking the White House from the Democrats.\n\nJames Buchanan promised in his inaugural address in 1857 that he would not run again. He said:\n\nHaving determined not to become a candidate for reelection, I shall have no motive to influence my conduct in administering the government, except the desire ably and faithfully to serve my country and to live in grateful memory of my countrymen.\n\nBuchanan, who was in office when Southern states protested Abraham Lincoln\u2019s 1860 election victory by seceding, does not live in grateful memory of many historians. He\u2019s viewed as one of the worst American presidents.\n\nDemocrats lost control of the White House and the Senate in 1860, and Lincoln became the first Republican president.\n\nRutherford B. Hayes, a Republican, promised to serve one term and did so after the disputed 1876 presidential election, by which a compromise handed Hayes the White House but also essentially ended Reconstruction.\n\nReforming the civil service was a major issue of the day, and it played into Hayes\u2019 decision, according to his letter accepting the Republican nomination in 1876.\n\n\u2026 believing that the restoration of the civil service, to the system established by Washington and followed by the early Presidents, can best be accomplished by an Executive who is under no temptation to use the patronage of his office, to promote his own re-election, I desire to perform what I regard as a duty, in stating now my inflexible purpose, if elected, not to be a candidate for election to a second term.\n\nRepublicans picked James Garfield at their 1880 convention to succeed Hayes, and Garfield not only won the White House but his party gained control of both the House and the Senate.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.",

        "text": "Would Marco Rubio need to move out Florida if Trump picks him for vice president?\nThe Constitution states a a ticket's candidates can't reside in the same state.\n\nWould Marco Rubio need to move out Florida if Trump picks him for vice president?\n\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio is said to be among the top candidates former President Donald Trump is considering as his pick for vice president, but there's a major obstacle standing in his way: his Florida address.\n\nRubio is viewed as an individual who could help Trump attract Hispanic voters and has substantial experience in foreign policy as vice chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence and the senior member of the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\nHowever, the 12th Amendment to the Constitution states that presidential and vice presidential candidates running on the same ticket \"shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves.\" Currently, both Trump and Rubio claim residency in Florida.\n\nIt boils down to electors -- the party loyalists nominated by a state's political party to pledge support to the nominee. The Electoral College is made up of 538 of these electors, and 270 electoral votes are needed for a candidate to clinch the White House. The number of electors apportioned to states is based on population -- and Florida has a crucial 30 electoral votes.\n\nThe 12th Amendment was added to the Constitution in 1804 to modify the Electoral College process -- specifically how the president and vice president are selected at once.\n\nSenator Marco Rubio speaks during a campaign rally for former President Donald Trump at West Palm Convention Center, in West Palm Beach, FL, June 14, 2024. Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIf Trump selected Rubio as his running mate, electors from Florida could not vote for both Trump and Rubio under the 12th Amendment. But it would be perfectly fine for electors from the other 49 states to vote for both. Most states give all their electoral votes to whichever candidate wins that state's popular vote.\n\n\"So, it is not prohibited to have both candidates from the same state; it just sacrifices their chances of winning a full slate of electoral votes from their home state,\" Thomas Berry, a legal fellow at the Robert A. Levy Center for Constitutional Studies and the editor-in-chief of the Cato Supreme Court Review, told ABC News.\n\nLaurence Tribe, professor emeritus of constitutional law at Harvard University, told ABC News that in \"concrete terms\" this means that \"none of Florida's 30 electoral votes may be cast this December for both Trump and Rubio unless Rubio or Trump 'ceases to be an inhabitant' of Florida before Dec. 17, 2024,\" which is when the electoral college votes.\n\nIt's doubtful that Trump would change his residency from Florida, having made it his primary residence in 2019, changing it from New York. So, it would fall on Rubio to change his residency.\n\n\"Thus, it follows that Trump can't select Rubio as his running mate without sacrificing those crucial 30 votes toward his needed 270, which he of course wouldn't do unless Rubio abandons his Florida residence before the election,\" Tribe said.\n\nThere is a precedent of a vice presidential pick changing their residency to secure their state's electoral vote. In the 2000 presidential election, former Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney changed his residency from Texas to Wyoming to be on the ticket with former President George W. Bush.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump stands with Sen. Marco Rubio during a rally at the Miami-Dade County Fair and Exposition in Miami, FL, Nov. 6, 2022. Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nTribe also says that there is a possibility that Rubio could still maintain his Senate seat even if he does change his Florida residency.\n\n\"Article I, Section 3 merely requires that a senator 'when elected' be 'an Inhabitant of that State for which he shall be chosen,' and Rubio was indeed an inhabitant of Florida when elected to his current term, his third, in November 2022,\" Tribe said.\n\n\"Despite the constitutional anomaly of someone serving as a senator of a state that he no longer inhabits, if Rubio could convince people that he no longer is a Florida resident, then Trump could legally pick him.\"\n\nDue to his ties to Nevada, that state has been rumored as a possible residency for Rubio to select. The Florida senator spent time in Nevada as a child when his family lived there for several years between 1979 and 1985.\n\nThe Trump campaign is also making a play for the state, a crucial battleground that went for the former president in 2016 and President Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nIn June, while campaigning in Las Vegas, Trump called for eliminating taxes on workers' tips, a crucial source of income for those working in Nevada's tourism industry.\n\nHowever, Rubio has remained mum on changing his residency to secure a spot on Trump's presidential ticket. Following the first presidential debate, ABC News asked Rubio if he would change his residency.\n\n\"Nice try,\" Rubio replied.\n\nABC's Isabella Murray contributed to this report",

        "text": "Opinion | Don\u2019t Doubt NATO. It Saved My People.\nSome in the United States have downplayed the importance of NATO. Many European partners worry that after the U.S. presidential election in November, the American commitment to the alliance will wane. But as NATO prepares for the start of its summit in Washington on Tuesday, marking 75 years since its birth, I would like to remind the world of how NATO is etched into the cultural and political identity of one country in Europe: my own, Kosovo.\n\nIn 1999, a ruthless Serbian campaign led by the Serb leader and Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic brought massacres, rapes and the expulsion of about half of Kosovo\u2019s majority Albanian population. It was a humanitarian disaster. NATO\u2019s sustained aerial bombardment of Serb forces and positions put a stop to the horror. The alliance sent in nearly 50,000 troops immediately after.\n\nWho among my people could forget the sight of NATO soldiers being cheered as they arrived? Over the past 25 years, as NATO helped liberate Kosovo and maintained the peace, we in return built democracy to foster this peace from within. We declared our independence in 2008, an idea that will resonate with Americans who have just celebrated their Independence Day. Most of the world now recognizes the nation known as Kosovo, although I prefer the Albanian spelling, Kosova.\n\nThere was little doubt to us, given the fresh memories of genocide in Rwanda and Bosnia, that the situation in Kosovo would have deteriorated rapidly without NATO. As a Kosovar, it is painful even to imagine how much worse it could have become.",

Timothy Mellon, heir to the Mellon banking fortune, is the leading donor in the 2024 election cycle, having donated more than $100 million so far.\n\nWith a $50 million donation on May 31, his total contribution to Trump\u2019s main super PAC exceeded $75 million. The remaining $25 million went to American Values 2024, a super PAC backing Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s independent bid for the Oval Office.\n\nFind out who is funding each campaign and the amounts they donated. Don\u2019t see the list? Click here for our top donor list.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nA few weeks before Mellon\u2019s donation, Republican mega-donors Elizabeth and Richard Uihlein made their first significant contribution of $10 million to Make America Great Again Inc., Trump's main super PAC. The Uihleins are also major backers of Club for Growth Action, a super PAC that supports candidates advocating for lower taxes and reduced government spending. Over the past few decades, only a handful of donors have spent more money than the Uihleins in conservative politics.\n\nKelcy Warren, a Texas billionaire and co-founder of the pipeline company Energy Transfer, made a $5 million donation on May 29, a day before the conviction. Warren is a big donor to America First Action Inc., a group that promotes Trump\u2019s policies led by Linda McMahon, who is the second largest Trump donor after Mellon in this election cycle.\n\nOn the Democratic side, billionaire Michael Bloomberg donated $19 million to Future Forward PAC, which backs President Joe Biden. In May, billionaires James Simons and Fred Eychaner donated another $6.6 million and $2 million, respectively. The group, which ended May with $92 million in cash on hand, plans to run a $250 million ad campaign from the fall through election day in the battleground states.\n\nKennedy Jr.\u2019s main super PAC raised just $281,503 in May, with hedge fund manager Robert Bishop contributing $175,000 of the total.\n\nWhile these outside groups can\u2019t coordinate with the campaign, they can raise unlimited amounts of money and spend as much as they like.\n\nOn the back of his conviction, the Trump campaign outraised Biden in May, narrowing the funding gap between the two campaigns. As USA TODAY reported last month, Trump and the Republican National Committee, which is led by the Trump family after a management shakeup, raised $141 million in May, outraising Biden\u2019s campaign and the Democratic National Committee by $56 million, according to the numbers from the two campaigns. These numbers can be independently confirmed once quarterly reports are filed with the FEC around mid-July.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign entered June with $116.6 million in cash on hand, while Biden\u2019s campaign entered with $91.6 million in cash on hand.\n\nWe have been tracking the campaign finance reports since February. Here are the links to our previous reports:\n\nJune: Timothy Mellon donated another $15 million to super PACs backing Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in April\n\nMay: Biden\u2019s campaign maintained a significant fundraising lead over Trump in March, ending the month with $85.5 million in cash on hand\n\nMarch: President Joe Biden significantly expanded his fundraising lead over former President Donald Trump in February\n\nFebruary: President Biden\u2019s campaign committee had nearly double the cash on hand compared to Trump\u2019s as of the end of January",

        "text": "Iran election 2024: Reformist Pezeshkian wins presidential runoff election, defeating Jalili\nReformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian won Iran\u2019s runoff presidential election Saturday, besting hard-liner Saeed Jalili by promising to reach out to the West and ease enforcement on the country\u2019s mandatory headscarf law after years of sanctions and protests squeezing the Islamic Republic.\n\nMr. Pezeshkian promised no radical changes to Iran\u2019s Shiite theocracy in his campaign and long has held Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as the final arbiter of all matters of state in the country. But even Mr. Pezeshkian\u2019s modest aims will be challenged by an Iranian government still largely held by hard-liners, the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, and Western fears over Tehran enriching uranium to near-weapons-grade levels.\n\nEditorial | Waiting for the reformist: On the Iran election\n\nA vote count offered by authorities put Mr. Pezeshkian as the winner with 16.3 million votes to Jalili\u2019s 13.5 million in Friday\u2019s election. Overall, Iran\u2019s Interior Ministry said 30 million people voted in an election held without internationally recognized monitors.\n\nSupporters of Mr. Pezeshkian, a heart surgeon and longtime lawmaker, entered the streets of Tehran and other cities before dawn to celebrate as his lead grew over Jalili, a hard-line former nuclear negotiator.\n\nBut Mr. Pezeshkian\u2019s win still sees Iran at a delicate moment, with tensions high in the Mideast over the Israel-Hamas war, Iran\u2019s advancing nuclear program, and a looming election in the United States that could put any chance of a detente between Tehran and Washington at risk. Mr. Pezeshkian\u2019s victory also wasn\u2019t a rout of Jalili, meaning he\u2019ll have to carefully navigate Iran\u2019s internal politics as the doctor has never held a sensitive, high-level security post.\n\nThe first round of voting June 28 saw the lowest turnout in the history of the Islamic Republic since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Iranian officials have long pointed to turnout as a sign of support for the country\u2019s Shiite theocracy, which has been under strain after years of sanctions crushing Iran\u2019s economy, mass demonstrations and intense crackdowns on all dissent.\n\nGovernment officials up to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei predicted a higher participation rate as voting got underway, with state television airing images of modest lines at some polling centers across the country.\n\nHowever, online videos purported to show some polls empty while a survey of several dozen sites in the capital, Tehran, saw light traffic amid a heavy security presence on the streets.\n\nAuthorities put the turnout in Friday\u2019s election at 49.6%, still historically low for an Iranian presidential election. They counted 607,575 voided votes in the contest \u2014 which often are a sign of protest by those who feel obligated to cast a ballot but reject both candidates.\n\nThe election came amid heightened regional tensions. In April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel over the war in Gaza, while militia groups that Tehran arms in the region \u2014 such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels \u2014 are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks.\n\nIran is also enriching uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build several nuclear weapons, should it choose to do so. And while Khamenei remains the final decision-maker on matters of state, whichever man ends up winning the presidency could bend the country\u2019s foreign policy toward either confrontation or collaboration with the West.\n\nThe campaign also repeatedly touched on what would happen if former President Donald Trump, who unilaterally withdrew America from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018, won the November election. Iran has held indirect talks with President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, though there\u2019s been no clear movement back toward constraining Tehran\u2019s nuclear program for the lifting of economic sanctions.\n\nThough identifying with reformists and relative moderates within Iran\u2019s theocracy during the campaign, Pezeshkian at the same time honored Iran\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, on one occasion wearing its uniform to parliament. He repeatedly criticized the United States and praised the Guard for shooting down an American drone in 2019, saying it \u201cdelivered a strong punch in the mouth of the Americans and proved to them that our country will not surrender.\u201d\n\nMore than 61 million Iranians over the age of 18 were eligible to vote, with about 18 million of them between 18 and 30. Voting was to end at 6 p.m. but was extended until midnight to boost participation.\n\nThe late President Ebrahim Raisi, who died in a May helicopter crash, was seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Khamenei and a potential successor as supreme leader.\n\nStill, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf, or hijab.",

        "text": "Landslide victory\nElection result wherein a party or candidate wins by a large margin\n\nA landslide victory is an election result in which the winning candidate or party achieves a decisive victory by an overwhelming margin, securing a very large majority of votes or seats far beyond the typical competitive outcome.[1][2][3][4] The term became popular in the 1800s to describe a victory in which the opposition is \"buried\",[1] similar to the way in which a geological landslide buries whatever is in its path. A landslide victory for one party is often accompanied by an electoral wipeout for the opposition, as the overwhelming support for the winning side inflicts a decisive loss on its rivals. What qualifies as a landslide victory can vary depending on the type of electoral system, as the term does not entail a precise, technical, or universally agreed-upon measurement. Instead, it is used informally in everyday language, making it subject to interpretation. Even within a single electoral system, there is no consensus on the exact margin that constitutes a landslide victory.[1]\n\nA landslide victory implies a powerful expression of popular will and a ringing endorsement by the electorate for the winner\u2019s political platform. Such a decisive outcome can lead the winner to interpret it as a mandate or a tacit authorization from the public to implement their proposed policies and pursue their agenda with confidence. Emboldened by the result, the winner may undertake ambitious reforms or significant policy shifts to reflect the electorate\u2019s desire for meaningful change.[5]\n\nA combination of factors\u2013such as charismatic leadership, a favorable shift in public sentiment driven by dissatisfaction with the status quo, strategic electoral campaigning and a positive media portrayal\u2013can create the conditions necessary for a landslide victory. Such a victory may fundamentally reshape the political landscape of a country, for example Franklin D. Roosevelt's election as US president in 1932.[6] In this imbalanced landscape, the winning party could implement policies more easily, facing little resistance, while the severely weakened opposition may struggle to perform essential checks and balances.\n\nNotable examples [ edit ]\n\nAustralia [ edit ]\n\nLocal and mayoral elections:\n\nState and territory elections:\n\n2021 Western Australian state election \u2013 Mark McGowan led the Labor Party to win 53 out of the 59 seats in the lower house. The Labor Party had a primary vote of 59.92% and a two-party-preferred vote of 69.68%. The National Party won 4 seats and the Liberal Party won 2 seats, making the National Party the official opposition, the first time they had held this status since the 1940s. To date, the election is the most decisive result at any Australian state or federal election since Federation, in terms of both percentage of lower house seats controlled by the governing party (89.8%) and two-party preferred margin.

Seats won by Labor are in red, seats won by the Liberals are in blue and seats won by the Nationals are in green.\n\nBarbados [ edit ]\n\nIn Barbadian general elections, a landslide victory involves a large swing from one party to another as well as one party winning a large majority in parliament. Landslide victories have usually occurred after a long period of government from one particular party and a change in the popular mood.\n\nBrazil [ edit ]\n\nMap by municipalities of FHC's landslide victory in 1998.\n\nCanada [ edit ]\n\nA map of the vote by province in 1940 shows the scale of the Liberals' landslide victory.\n\nA map of the vote by province in 1984 shows the scale of the Progressive Conservatives' landslide victory.\n\nIn a Canadian federal election, a landslide victory occurs when a political party gains a significant majority of the House of Commons of Canada.\n\nLandslide victories may also occur during provincial elections, and territorial elections in Yukon. Landslide victories are not possible for territorial elections in the Northwest Territories, and Nunavut, as its members are elected without reference to political parties, operating as a consensus government.\n\nNational landslide victories [ edit ]\n\nThe following Canadian federal elections resulted in landslide victories:[11]\n\n1874 \u2013 The Liberals won 133 seats while the Conservatives won just 73 seats.\n\n1878 \u2013 The Conservatives won 137 seats while the Liberals won just 69 seats.\n\n1882 \u2013 The Conservatives won 139 seats while the Liberals won just 71 seats.\n\n1900 \u2013 The Liberals won 132 seats while the Conservatives won just 81.\n\n1904 \u2013 The Liberals won 139 seats while the Conservatives won just 75.\n\n1908 \u2013 The Liberals won 133 seats while the Conservatives won just 85.\n\n1911 \u2013 The Conservatives won 133 seats while the Liberals won just 86.\n\n1917 \u2013 The Conservatives won 153 seats while the Liberals won just 82.\n\n1930 \u2013 The Conservatives won 137 seats while the Liberals won just 91.\n\n1935 \u2013 The Liberals won 171 seats while the Conservatives won just 39.\n\n1940 \u2013 The Liberals won 178 seats while the Progressive Conservatives won just 39.\n\n1949 \u2013 The Liberals won 190 seats while the Progressive Conservatives won just 41.\n\n1953 \u2013 The Liberals won 171 seats while the Progressive Conservatives won just 51.\n\n1958 \u2013 The Progressive Conservatives won 208 seats while the Liberals won just 48.\n\n1968 \u2013 The Liberals won 155 seats while the Progressive Conservatives won just 72.\n\n1984 \u2013 The Progressive Conservatives won 211 seats while the Liberals won just 40.\n\n1993 \u2013 The Liberals won 177 seats while the Bloc Qu\u00e9becois, which ran only in Quebec, won 54. The ruling Progressive Conservatives dropped from 154 to 2. This is considered as the last landslide Canadian federal election.\n\nProvincial examples [ edit ]\n\nCosta Rica [ edit ]\n\nCroatia [ edit ]\n\nResults in all of Croatia's counties: the counties in blue voted for Tu\u0111man, and Istria County voted for Gotovac (marked in yellow).\n\nDominica [ edit ]\n\nFiji [ edit ]\n\nFinland [ edit ]\n\nFrance [ edit ]\n\nOnly include those after 1958.\n\nFrench Polynesia [ edit ]\n\nGrenada [ edit ]\n\nIn Grenadian general elections, a landslide victory involves a large swing from one party to another as well as one party winning a large majority in parliament. Landslide victories have usually occurred after a long period of government from one particular party and a change in the popular mood.\n\nHong Kong [ edit ]\n\nLegislative Council elections:\n\n1991 \u2013 The pro-democracy camp won 16 of the 18 directly elected geographical constituency seats, with a coalition of the United Democrats of Hong Kong and the Meeting Point taking 14 of the seats.\n\n1995 \u2013 The pro-democracy camp swept 16 of the 20 directly elected geographical constituency seats in which the Democratic Party alone took 12 directly elected seats.\n\n2021 \u2013 The pro-Beijing camp took 89 out of 90 seats in the Legislative Council. Many democratic candidates had been barred from running, and turnout was extremely low.\n\nLocal elections:\n\n2019 \u2013 The pro-democracy camp seized control of 17 of the 18 District Councils, tripling their seats from about 124 to 389. The pro-Beijing parties and independents won only 61 seats, a loss of 242 seats, received their largest defeat in history.\n\nHungary [ edit ]\n\n2010 \u2013 Fidesz\u2013KDNP won 262 of the 386 seats thus being the first party to win a super-majority since 1990.\n\n2022 \u2013 Despite an electoral alliance of almost all opposition parties, Fidesz\u2013KDNP won 135 of the 199 seats thus winning a super-majority for the fourth time in a row.\n\nIreland [ edit ]\n\nThe 1977 Irish general election, which elected members of the 21st D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann on 16 June 1977, resulted in a landslide win for the main opposition party Fianna F\u00e1il. The election saw the party win 84 seats in the 148 D\u00e1il, receiving 50.6% of all first preference votes cast. The incumbent Fine Gael/Labour National Coalition government was defeated, with Fianna F\u00e1il gaining a 20-seat majority in the lower house of the Oireachtas (Ireland's national parliament). This was the last time a single political party won an outright majority in an Irish general election.\n\nItaly [ edit ]\n\n2005 Italian regional elections \u2013 The Union centre-left coalition won the presidency in 12 out of 14 regions that were holding elections that year. After this election the centre-left controlled the presidency in 16 out of Italy's 20 regions.\n\n2020 Venetian regional election \u2013 Incumbent president of Veneto Luca Zaia (Lega) won carrying 76.79% of the vote, five times as many as his main opponent Arturo Lorenzoni's (PD) 15.72%.\n\nJamaica [ edit ]\n\nIn Jamaican elections, a landslide victory involves a large swing from one party to another as well as one party winning a large majority in parliament. Landslide victories have usually occurred after a long period of government from one particular party and a change in the popular mood.\n\nMalaysia [ edit ]\n\nMexico [ edit ]\n\nMonaco [ edit ]\n\nMonaco is traditionally dominated by conservative parties with only two cases in which left-of-centre parties won any seats (1963 and 1973).\n\nNew Zealand [ edit ]\n\nUntil 1993, New Zealand used the traditional first-past-the-post system as in the U.K. to determine representation in its Parliament. Thus, landslide elections at that time were defined in an identical fashion, i.e. where one party got an overwhelming majority of the seats. Since 1996, New Zealand has used the mixed member proportional system as in Germany, making landslides much less likely.[17]\n\nFirst past the post\n\nMMP\n\nPapua New Guinea [ edit ]\n\nParaguay [ edit ]\n\nPhilippines [ edit ]\n\nRamon Magsaysay (light green)'s 1953 landslide victory.\n\nIn 1941, the Nacionalista Party won the presidency, vice presidency, all seats in the Senate, and all but 3 seats in the House of Representatives. This was the biggest landslide in Philippine history. The legislators didn't serve until 1945 though, due to World War II.\n\nStarting in 1987, the Philippines evolved into a multi-party system, and coupled with the introduction of party-list elections in 1998, no party was able to win a landslide, much less a majority of seats, in the House of Representatives since then. This has also meant, until 2022, that no presidential and vice presidential election winner won a majority of votes, although, in 1998, the winners were described as having landslide victories, despite winning less than a majority of votes, due to large winning margins. Senatorial landslides are more possible though in midterm elections, as voters are usually presented with two distinct choices. The 2022 presidential election was the first landslide since 1987.\n\nPresidential and vice presidential elections\n\nIn the Philippines, while there are presidential tickets, the positions of president and vice president are elected separately.\n\nSenate\n\nHouse of Representatives\n\nPortugal [ edit ]\n\nLegislative Elections\n\nDistrict map that shows the scale of the 1991 Social Democrats' landslide victory.\n\nDistrict map that shows the scale of the 2022 Socialists' landslide victory.\n\nPresidential Elections\n\nAzorean Regional Elections\n\nMadeiran Regional Elections\n\nAlberto Jo\u00e3o Jardim, member of the Social Democratic Party (PSD) was the president of the Madeira region from 1978 to 2015. During this period of time, landslide victories for the Social Democrats were the norm. In 2015, the party, now led by Miguel Albuquerque, also achieved a landslide victory.\n\nSamoa [ edit ]\n\nSlovakia [ edit ]\n\nSpain [ edit ]\n\nBasque Country [ edit ]\n\n2001 \u2013 Juan Jose Ibarretxe's Basque National Party-Basque Solidarity (PNV-EA) alliance won 33 seats and 42.2% of the share, 20 percentage points ahead of PP. The result is the best performance for the top voted list in a Basque regional election. With a record turnout of 79%, PNV-EA obtained more than 600,000 votes. PNV-EA also won more seats than PP (19) and PSE-EE (13) together, and was able to secure a working majority in parliament.\n\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines [ edit ]\n\nA landslide victory in the elections of St. Vincent and the Grenadines involves a large swing from one party to another as well as one party winning a large majority in parliament. Landslide victories have usually occurred after a long period of government from one particular party and a change in the popular mood.\n\nTaiwan [ edit ]\n\nIn the 2020 election, the Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen won 8.17 million votes, 57.1% of the votes cast, a historic landslide victory.\n\nPresidential and Legislative Election held on the same day\n\nTrinidad and Tobago [ edit ]\n\nIn Trinidad and Tobago's elections, a landslide victory involves a large swing from one party to another as well as one party winning a large majority in parliament. Landslide victories have usually occurred after a long period of government from one particular party and a change in the popular mood. Party politics and the political structure in Trinidad and Tobago has generally run along ethnic lines with most Afro-Trinidadians supporting the People's National Movement (PNM) and most Indo-Trinidadians supporting various Indian-majority parties, such as the current United National Congress (UNC) or its predecessors.\n\nTobago\n\nUkraine [ edit ]\n\n2019 Ukrainian presidential election \u2013 Volodymyr Zelenskyy won all regions but one and 73.22% of the popular vote in the second round of the election, unseating incumbent Petro Poroshenko, who received 24.45% of the popular vote.\n\nUnited Kingdom [ edit ]\n\nThis map shows the Conservative Party landslide victory in 2019.\n\nThis map shows the Labour Party landslide victory in 2024.\n\nIn UK General Elections, a landslide victory involves winning a large majority in parliament and often goes with a large swing from one party to another as well. Landslide victories have usually occurred after a long period of government from one particular party and a change in the popular mood. In the past a majority of over 100 was regarded as the technical hurdle to be defined as a landslide, as that allows the government freedom to easily enact its policies in parliament. In more recent times, the label 'landslide' has been applied in numerous press articles to victories which would not previously have been regarded as such, for example the Conservative Party majority of 80 in 2019. Its current usage is more as political commentary rather than technical definition and is a reflection of the strength of the party's ability to put its programme through parliament.[24][25][26][27]\n\nThe largest landslide by any single party in the UK parliament, since universal suffrage was introduced, was the majority of 179 won by Tony Blair's Labour Party in 1997.\n\nNotable landslide election results\n\nUnited States [ edit ]\n\nThe map of the Electoral College in 1936 shows the scale of Franklin D. Roosevelt's landslide victory.\n\nThe map of the Electoral College in 1964 shows the scale of Lyndon B. Johnson's landslide victory.\n\nThe map of the Electoral College in 1972 shows the scale of Richard Nixon's landslide victory.\n\nThe map of the Electoral College in 1984 shows the scale of Ronald Reagan's landslide victory.\n\nA landslide victory in U.S. Presidential elections occurs when a candidate has an overwhelming majority in the Electoral College.\n\nSee also [ edit ]",

        "text": "Biden campaigns in Pennsylvania as Democrats discuss his candidacy\nUS President Joe Biden campaigns in Pennsylvania despite rising Democratic pressure to end re-election bid after weak debate performance.\n\nUnited States President Joe Biden is on a campaign trail in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania as he fights to save his endangered re-election effort following a June 27 disastrous debate performance against his rival Donald Trump.\n\nBiden, 81, has vowed to stay in the race and win the November 5 presidential election, despite growing calls from fellow Democrats to end his campaign.\n\nOn Sunday, Biden attended a predominantly Black Mount Airy Church of God in Christ in northwest Philadelphia, where he entered the gold-chandeliered sanctuary to applause and a cry of \u201cLet him know we are with him!\u201d\n\nLater in the day, he will travel to the nearby state capital, Harrisburg, for an ice cream social event with union members and local Democrats, his campaign said on Sunday.\n\nThis is Biden\u2019s 10th visit to Pennsylvania during the 2024 election cycle. On Saturday, he spoke with the national co-chairs of his campaign, the White House said, without providing any details.\n\nIn a taped interview with news anchor George Stephanopoulos, which aired on Friday evening, Biden said only the \u201cLord Almighty\u201d could persuade him to drop out, dismissing the prospect that Democratic leaders could join forces to try to talk him into standing down.\n\nDespite his performance, Biden\u2019s family has encouraged him to remain in the race.\n\nRising pressure to step down\n\nThe president is struggling to put down a slow-boil uprising among some congressional Democrats and some influential donors who fear he lacks the capacity to defeat Trump in light of the debate.\n\nPressure from the US Congress seems likely to ramp up in the coming days as lawmakers return to Washington from a holiday recess, and donors mull their willingness to keep funding his campaign.\n\nFive US lawmakers have called for Biden to end his re-election bid, including Representative Angie Craig of Minnesota, the first Democratic member of the House of Representatives from a battleground district, with others reportedly poised to join in.\n\n\u201cGiven what I saw and heard from the President during last week\u2019s debate in Atlanta, coupled with the lack of a forceful response from the President himself following that debate, I do not believe that the President can effectively campaign and win against Donald Trump,\u201d Craig, a top 2024 target of House Republican efforts, posted on X.\n\nTwo letters are circulating among House Democrats calling for Biden to step aside, House Democratic sources have said.\n\nUS Senator Mark Warner of Virginia was contacting some fellow Democratic senators to invite them to a possible meeting on Monday to discuss Biden\u2019s campaign. Biden told reporters he had spoken with 20 congressional Democrats, who urged him to stay on, and said he knew of no senators ready to join Warner.\n\nThe political crisis is also unfolding as Biden prepares to host dozens of world leaders at a high-stakes NATO summit in Washington on Tuesday and hold a rare solo news conference.\n\nThe trip to Pennsylvania is part of a July voter outreach blitz by the Democratic Party that includes a $50m paid media campaign aimed at events such as the Olympic Games and travel by Biden, his wife, Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband to every battleground state.\n\nThe campaign said it aims to have volunteers and staff knock on more than three million voters\u2019 doors in July and August.",

        "text": "This Nebraska congressional district could be the key to the presidential election\nFor Joe Biden and Donald Trump, the road to the White House runs through battleground states clustered along the Great Lakes, and in the fast-growing \u201csun belt\u201d of the south. But if the election turns out to be extremely close, the two candidates\u2019 fortunes may hinge on a few hundred thousand voters clustered in a single congressional district in the middle of the country.\n\nThis lesser-known front can be found in Nebraska, one of only two states in the country, along with Maine, that allocate a portion of their electoral votes by congressional district, rather than giving all of them to the winner of the state.\n\nIn 2020, Biden became the first Democrat in 12 years to win Nebraska\u2019s second congressional district, which encompasses the largest city, Omaha, and its suburbs. The pressure to win a majority of its voters is expected to be even higher this year, as Biden looks to fend off a resurgent Trump while reassuring Democrats that he can still do the job after his troubling performance in their first debate.\n\nWhile much of the candidates\u2019 attention is focused on the seven swing states expected to decide the election (Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, Arizona, North Carolina and Georgia) the Biden campaign also counts winning the Nebraska district as among its priorities \u2013 so much so that some Trump allies are encouraging the state\u2019s Republican lawmakers to change their rules to ensure the former president wins the entirety of its electoral votes.\n\n\u201cI think the district is probably going to get more attention this time than it did even in 2020,\u201d said Ryan Horn, a Republican media strategist who splits his time between Omaha and Washington DC.\n\nTrump is too extreme for the second congressional district Jane Kleeb, chair of the Nebraska Democratic party\n\nThough Biden won its vote in 2020, the district was then not essential to his victory, since he also triumphed in all the battleground states that Trump had won four years earlier, albeit narrowly. But polls indicate the Democrat\u2019s standing with voters has weakened since then, and it is not difficult to imagine a scenario in which the race does come down to the urbanized and relatively diverse district spread across three counties on Nebraska\u2019s eastern flank.\n\nIf Trump wins Arizona, Georgia and Nevada and a Republican-leaning district in Maine, but Biden wins the three traditionally Democratic Great Lakes states and Nebraska\u2019s congressional district, that would give the president the 270 votes he needs to clinch re-election. But if the Nebraska district flips to Trump, that would tie the candidates with 269 electoral votes each, and the House of Representatives would determine the election\u2019s outcome. Each state\u2019s delegation would get one vote, and Republicans would have the advantage: the GOP controls 26 delegations and Democrats 22, while two are tied.\n\nUnlike in the battleground states, there are few publicly available polls of the second congressional district\u2019s voters. In interviews, local Democrats and the Biden campaign sounded optimistic about the president\u2019s chances of once again winning what they call Nebraska\u2019s \u201cblue dot\u201d.\n\n\u201cTrump is too extreme for the second congressional district,\u201d said Jane Kleeb, chair of the Nebraska Democratic party.\n\nThe state began splitting its electoral votes in the 1992 election, and prior to 2020, the district had only once before supported a Democrat, giving Barack Obama a one-percentage-point victory in 2008. Four years ago, Biden beat Trump by a six-percentage-point margin in the region of more than 650,000 people, which in addition to African American and Hispanic communities includes many of the sorts of suburbs that have become key to Democratic victories nationwide.\n\nIn March, second gentleman Doug Emhoff made a visit to Omaha focused on reproductive rights \u2013 an issue on which Democrats hope to rally voters nationwide, even in conservative states. The party is also backing efforts to get initiatives legalizing medical cannabis and protecting abortion access onto Nebraska\u2019s November ballot.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what infrastructure the Trump campaign has deployed in the district, and spokespeople for the former president did not respond to emails seeking comment. Republicans are the dominant party statewide, controlling the legislature, the governor\u2019s mansion and the entire congressional delegation, but the state party has been gripped by infighting ever since officials casting themselves as more aligned with Trump took over two years ago.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Berkshire Hathaway building in Omaha, Nebraska, on 1 May 2009.

While he views the outcome as unlikely, Hibbing said the concerted effort by Trump and his supporters to cast Biden\u2019s victory four years ago as illegitimate serves as as a poor omen for what would happen if the district were pivotal to the election outcome.\n\n\u201cIf they made a big to-do out of things when it wasn\u2019t close, what [is it] going to look like if it really should come down to just one district? I think it would be bad,\u201d he said.",

Biden said only the \u201cLord Almighty\u201d telling him to do so would prompt him to leave the race.\n\nBut Democratic leaders, donors and pundits continue to question whether Biden can continue in the race. If Biden were to shift course and step down \u2013 Harris appears to hold most of the cards over a raft of potential Democratic candidates including California Governor Gavin Newsom, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Transport Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nThe sitting veep would likely be the only one who could short-circuit a truncated nomination squabble that could turn the Democratic National Convention into a circular firing squad.\n\nAs the first black woman to serve as vice-president, Harris could make a powerful case that passing over her would be an unacceptable snub to the most loyal Democratic voters. Harris, 59, is also much more widely known than any of her potential rivals. Many believe she has the chops to successfully take the case to former president Donald Trump, who is widely despised and feared by Democratic voters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like apples and oranges,\u201d said Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the potential nominees.",

They advocated Christian pro-life family values and a ban on abortion in speeches that were pro-gun and anti-drug.",

Already, a number of left-wing politicians have ruled out supporting any potential bid for prime minister he might decide to make.\n\nThe NFP lays claim to the right to nominate a prime minister and while they are short of an absolute majority, Macron will only be able to nominate someone who is likely to receive support from a number of political factions.\n\nOver in the presidential camp, 30 executives from Macron's Renaissance party are meeting at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e this afternoon in order to take stock of the situation.\n\nAs for the National Rally, it is unlikely to find enough support among other parties and groupings to put forward a candidate from within its ranks.",

        "text": "Reformist Pezeshkian beats hard-liner to win Iran presidential election, promising outreach to West\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 Reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian won Iran\u2019s runoff presidential election Saturday, besting hard-liner Saeed Jalili by promising to reach out to the West and ease enforcement on the country\u2019s mandatory headscarf law after years of sanctions and protests squeezing the Islamic Republic.\n\nPezeshkian promised no radical changes to Iran\u2019s Shiite theocracy in his campaign and long has held Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as the final arbiter of all matters of state in the country. But even Pezeshkian\u2019s modest aims will be challenged by an Iranian government still largely held by hard-liners, the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, and Western fears over Tehran enriching uranium to near-weapons-grade levels with enough of a stockpile to produce several nuclear weapons if it chose.\n\nA vote count offered by authorities put Pezeshkian as the winner with 16.3 million votes to Jalili\u2019s 13.5 million in Friday\u2019s election. Overall, Iran\u2019s Interior Ministry said 30 million people voted in an election held without internationally recognized monitors, representing a turnout of 49.6% \u2014 higher than the historic low of the June 28 first round vote but lower than other presidential races.\n\nSupporters of Pezeshkian, a heart surgeon and longtime lawmaker, entered the streets of Tehran and other cities before dawn to celebrate as his lead grew over Jalili, a hard-line former nuclear negotiator. Pezeshkian later traveled to the mausoleum of the late Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of the 1979 Islamic Revolution, and addressed journalists in a chaotic event.\n\n\u201cIn this election, I didn\u2019t give you false promises. I did not lie,\u201d Pezeshkian said. \u201cIt\u2019s been many years after the revolution that we come to the podium, we make promises and we fail to fulfill them. This is the biggest problem we have.\u201d\n\nPezeshkian\u2019s win still sees Iran at a delicate moment, with tensions high in the Mideast and a looming election in the United States that could put any chance of a detente between Tehran and Washington at risk. Pezeshkian\u2019s victory also wasn\u2019t a rout of Jalili, meaning he\u2019ll have to carefully navigate Iran\u2019s internal politics as the doctor has never held a sensitive, high-level security post.\n\nGovernment officials up to Khameni, the supreme leader, predicted higher turnout as voting got underway, with state television airing images of modest lines at some polling centers. However, online videos purported to show some polls empty while a survey of several dozen sites in Tehran saw light traffic and a heavy security presence on the streets.\n\nAuthorities counted 607,575 voided votes \u2014 which often are a sign of protest by those who feel obligated to cast a ballot but reject both candidates.\n\nKhamenei praised the turnout Saturday despite what he alleged was a boycott campaign \u201corchestrated by the enemies of the Iranian nation to induce despair and a feeling of hopelessness.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would like to recommend Dr. Pezeshkian, the elected president, put his trust in God, the Compassionate, and set his vision on high, bright horizons,\u201d Khamenei added.\n\nVoters expressed a guarded optimism.\n\nA woman casts her vote for the presidential election in a polling station at the shrine of Saint Saleh in northern Tehran, Iran, Friday, July 5, 2024.

In April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel over the war in Gaza, while militia groups armed by Tehran \u2014 such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels \u2014 are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks.\n\nWhile Khamenei remains the final decision-maker on matters of state, Pezeshkian could bend the country\u2019s foreign policy toward either confrontation or collaboration with the West.\n\nCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, which has reached a detente with Iran, sent his congratulations to Pezeshkian that stressed his \u201ckeenness to develop and deepen the relations that bring our two countries and peoples together.\u201d Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has relied on Iranian-made drones in his war on Ukraine, similarly congratulated Pezeshkian.\n\nResponding to questions from The Associated Press, the U.S. State Department called the Iranian election \u201cnot free or fair\u201d and noted that \u201ca significant number of Iranians chose not to participate at all.\u201d\n\nCandidate for the Iran\u2019s presidential election Saeed Jalili, a hard-line former nuclear negotiator, casts his vote for the presidential runoff election at a polling station in Qarchak near Tehran, Iran, Friday, July 5, 2024.

Iran has held indirect talks with President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, though there\u2019s been no clear movement back toward constraining Tehran\u2019s nuclear program for the lifting of economic sanctions.\n\nPezeshkian\u2019s win saw Iran\u2019s rial strengthen Saturday against the U.S. dollar, trading 603,000 to $1, down from 615,000 on Thursday. The rial traded 32,000 to $1 at the time the 2015 nuclear deal was reached.\n\nThough identifying with reformists and relative moderates within Iran\u2019s theocracy during the campaign, Pezeshkian at the same time honored Iran\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, on one occasion wearing its uniform to parliament. He repeatedly criticized the United States and praised the Guard for shooting down an American drone in 2019, saying it \u201cdelivered a strong punch in the mouth of the Americans and proved to them that our country will not surrender.\u201d\n\nThe late President Ebrahim Raisi, whose death in a May helicopter crash sparked the early election, was seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Khamenei and a potential successor as supreme leader.\n\nStill, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf, or hijab.\n\n___\n\nVahdat reported from Tehran, Iran.

Dave Brat of Virginia hosted the show for Bannon, who is serving a four-month prison term.\n\n\u201cWe are in the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be,\u201d Roberts said.\n\nThose comments were widely circulated online and assailed by Biden\u2019s campaign, which accused Trump and his allies of \u201cdreaming of a violent revolution to destroy the very idea of America.\u201d\n\nSome of the people involved in Project 2025 are former senior administration officials. The project\u2019s director is Paul Dans, who served as chief of staff at the U.S. Office of Personnel Management under Trump. Trump\u2019s campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt was featured in one of Project 2025\u2019s videos.\n\nJohn McEntee, a former director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office in the Trump administration, is a senior adviser. McEntee told the conservative news site The Daily Wire earlier this year that Project 2025\u2019s team would integrate a lot of its work with the campaign after the summer when Trump would announce his transition team.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments on Project 2025 come before the Republican Party\u2019s meetings this coming week to begin to draft its party platform.\n\nProject 2025 has been preparing its own 180-day agenda for the next administration that it plans to share privately, rather than as part of its public-facing book of priorities for a Republican president. A key Trump ally, Russ Vought, who contributed to Project 2025 and is drafting this final pillar, is also on the Republican National Committee\u2019s platform writing committee.\n\nProject 2025 said in a statement it not tied to a specific candidate or campaign.\n\n\u201cWe are a coalition of more than 110 conservative groups advocating policy and personnel recommendations for the next conservative president,\u201d it said. \u201cBut it is ultimately up to that president, who we believe will be President Trump, to decide which recommendations to implement.\u201d\n\nA Biden campaign spokesperson said Project 2025 staff members are also leading the Republican policy platform. \u201cProject 2025 is the extreme policy and personnel playbook for Trump\u2019s second term that should scare the hell out of the American people,\u201d said Ammar Moussa.\n\nOn Thursday, as the country celebrated Independence Day and Biden prepared for his television interview after his halting debate performance, the president\u2019s campaign posted on X a shot from the dystopian TV drama \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d showing a group of women in the show\u2019s red dresses and white hats standing in formation by a reflecting pool with a cross at the far end where the Washington Monument should be. The story revolves around women who are stripped of their identities and forced to give birth to children for other couples in a totalitarian regime.\n\n\u201cFourth of July under Trump\u2019s Project 2025,\u201d the post said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Jill Colvin in New York and Lisa Mascaro in Washington contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Republicans ramp up attacks on Harris as talk of replacing Biden on 2024 ticket intensifies\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 For years it\u2019s been a Republican scare tactic.\n\nA vote to reelect President Joe Biden, the GOP often charges, is really a vote for Vice President Kamala Harris. It\u2019s an attack line sometimes tinged with racist and misogynist undertones and often macabre imagery.\n\nBut after Biden\u2019s dismal performance at last week\u2019s presidential debate, which has sparked Democratic calls for him to step aside, what was once dismissed as a far-right conspiracy \u2014 Harris replacing Biden \u2014 could now have a chance of coming to pass. And Republicans, including Donald Trump, are ramping up their attacks.\n\nWATCH: Big donors signal desire for Biden to leave the race as he doubles down on staying in\n\nTrump and his allies have been rolling out new attack lines against Harris, insulting her abilities, painting her as Biden\u2019s chief enabler and accusing her of being part of a coverup of his health. It\u2019s an effort, campaign officials insist, that is not a reflection of their concerns about a potential change at the top of the ticket, given Biden\u2019s insistence he is not leaving the race.\n\nBut in a post marking Independence Day on his Truth Social site Thursday, Trump singled out Harris, calling her his \u201cpotentially new Democrat Challenger\u201d and giving her a new derisive nickname: \u201cLaffin\u2019 Kamala Harris.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe did poorly in the Democrat Nominating process, starting out at Number Two, and ending up defeated and dropping out, even before getting to Iowa, but that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not a \u2018highly talented\u2019 politician! Just ask her Mentor, the Great Willie Brown of San Francisco,\u201d he wrote. (Harris dated Brown in the mid-1990s.)\n\nThe post came after Trump campaign senior advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles released a statement earlier this week that offered a different, but similar, moniker, calling her Biden\u2019s \u201cCackling Copilot Kamala Harris.\u201d\n\nTrump also posted an expletive-laced video, which was first been reported by the Daily Beast, in which he was captured on the golf course calling Biden an \u201cold broken down pile of crap\u201d and declaring that he\u2019d driven the president from the race. (Trump, in interviews, has repeatedly said he did not expect Biden to be pushed aside.)\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s quitting the race,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd that means we have Kamala. I think she\u2019s going to be better. She\u2019s so bad. She\u2019s so pathetic,\u201d he said.\n\nAllies have also joined the attacks, painting Harris as a chief defender of Biden\u2019s faculties and accusing her of lying to the American public.\n\nBiden, the White House and his campaign insist he has no plans to drop out of the race. During an interview with ABC News that aired Friday night he said that only \u201cthe Lord Almighty\u201d would drive him from the race.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre pushed back against the tenor of attacks against Harris, particularly Trump\u2019s decision to invoke a decades-old relationship and other sexist rhetoric.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s gross, I think it\u2019s disturbing,\u201d Jean-Pierre told reporters Friday aboard Air Force One. \u201cShe should be respected in the role that she has as vice president. She should be respected like any other vice president before her who was in that room. It is appalling that, I\u2019m going to be careful here, that a former president is saying that about a current vice president. And we should call that out \u2014 it is not OK.\u201d\n\nIt remains unclear how Harris would fare against Trump, compared to Biden. Replacing a candidate this late in a presidential cycle \u2014 much less an incumbent president who has already sailed through the Democratic Party\u2019s primaries \u2014 would be unprecedented in modern history, and the mechanics are complicated and potentially messy.\n\nREAD MORE: 3 reasons it would be tough for Democrats to replace Joe Biden on the presidential ticket\n\nPolling shows that Harris\u2019 favorability ratings are similar to Biden\u2019s and Trump\u2019s. A June AP-NORC poll found about 4 in 10 Americans have a favorable opinion of her. But the share of those who have an unfavorable opinion is slightly lower than for Trump and Biden, and about 1 in 10 have no opinion of her yet.\n\nHarris, at 59 years old, would be a marked generational contrast to Trump, who is 78 years old and has also shown signs of aging. As the first woman, the first Black person and the first person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president, she would also chart a potentially barrier-breaking candidacy that could draw the support of women, minority voters and younger people \u2014 groups with whom Trump has been working to make significant inroads.\n\nHarris has also been the Biden administration\u2019s leading voice on abortion rights, an animating issue for Democrats since the overturning of Roe v. Wade that could again motivate turnout this fall.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign, however, said it was confident in Trump\u2019s chances regardless of his opponent and dismissed the idea that Harris might pose a greater challenge to Trump, seeing her as a more polarizing figure than the president.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump will beat any Democrat on November 5th because he has a proven record and a agenda to Make America Great Again,\u201d LaCivita and Wiles said in their statement.\n\nOne campaign official suggested the focus on Harris was more of a reflection of the current media focus on the Democratic ticket than a belief that she will ultimately replace Biden.\n\nWhile the party has plenty of opposition research on Harris at the ready thanks to her 2020 campaign and her years as vice president, at the end of the day, they argue, the Biden record is the Harris record, and if she were to replace Biden, Trump aides wouldn\u2019t face a totally different race.\n\nHarris, for instance, was tapped by Biden to lead the administration\u2019s response to drivers of the border crisis, tying her to one of his weakest issues. And if he does drop out, they argue, voters will have issues trusting the administration, Harris and the press for not shedding light on Biden\u2019s weaknesses sooner.\n\n\u201cThe economy\u2019s still the economy, the border\u2019s still the border, there\u2019s still global conflicts,\u201d said Trump campaign spokesperson Danielle Alvarez. \u201cAnd changing the person at the top of the ticket doesn\u2019t change those realities for American voters.\u201d\n\nAssociated Press writers Linley Sanders and Josh Boak contributed to this report from Washington.",

        "text": "Dear Elites (of Both Parties), the People Will Take It From Here, Thanks - The New York Times\nI first learned about the opioid crisis three presidential elections ago, in the fall of 2011. I was the domestic policy director for Mitt Romney\u2019s campaign and questions began trickling in from the New Hampshire team: What\u2019s our plan?\n\nBy then, opioids had been fueling the deadliest drug epidemic in American history for years. I am ashamed to say I did not know what they were. Opioids, as in opium? I looked it up online. Pills of some kind. Tell them it\u2019s a priority, and President Obama isn\u2019t working. That year saw nearly 23,000 deaths from opioid overdoses nationwide.\n\nI was no outlier. America\u2019s political class was in the final stages of self-righteous detachment from the economic and social conditions of the nation it ruled. The infamous bitter clinger and \u201c47 percent\u201d comments by Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney captured the atmosphere well: delivered at private fund-raisers in San Francisco in 2008 and Boca Raton in 2012, evincing disdain for the voters who lived in between. The opioid crisis gained more attention in the years after the election, particularly in 2015, with Anne Case and Angus Deaton\u2019s research on deaths of despair.\n\nOf course, 2015\u2019s most notable political development was Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign launch and subsequent steamrolling of 16 Republican primary opponents committed to party orthodoxy. In the 2016 general election he narrowly defeated the former first lady, senator and secretary of state Hillary Clinton, who didn\u2019t need her own views of Americans leaked: In public remarks, she gleefully classified half of the voters who supported Mr. Trump as \u201cdeplorables,\u201d as her audience laughed and applauded. That year saw more than 42,000 deaths from opioid overdoses.",

But the prospect of a second Trump presidency brings uncertainty to DACA holders. Aspen Public Radio's Halle Zander has more.\n\nHALLE ZANDER, BYLINE: Luz Galaviz is in Salt Lake City's airport, waiting to board her plane to Mexico City.\n\nLUZ GALAVIZ: It is your home. But at the same time, like, it's like a foreign country to you.\n\nZANDER: Galaviz is an elementary school teacher in Rifle, Colo., and she hasn't been to Mexico, the country where she was born, since she first left 25 years ago. She was 5 years old.\n\nGALAVIZ: I'm visualizing the landing there and just looking at the buildings, the architecture, the people, like we talked about. I really want to just, like, dive into the culture.\n\nZANDER: DACA recipients aren't allowed to travel abroad. But Galaviz applied and received permission to attend a leadership conference in Mexico. She can do it through a special permit called advance parole. That means the agency that issues green cards and other visas allows her to travel internationally for a set period of time. That allows Galaviz to continue seeking a secure status in the U.S. upon her return.\n\nGALAVIZ: I've seen lawyers in the past just to kind of see, like, where I'm at in the process, and I don't know. It's such a tricky situation. It could be, like, another work visa of another type.\n\nZANDER: DACA doesn't provide a path to citizenship. However, trips like this can actually help DACA recipients like her get the next best thing. When immigrants cross the border without going through customs and border patrol, they don't have a legal entry on record, which most green card and visa applications require. But with advance parole, travellers go through airports and are interviewed by customs when they return, checking that box. It's a step in the right direction for many, but come November, it may be off the table.\n\nJULIA GELATT: I think if President Trump is reelected, he will try to end the DACA program again.\n\nZANDER: That's Julia Gelatt of the Migration Policy Institute. She says, in 2017, former President Trump tried to repeal DACA, and advance parole applications weren't granted either. But legal challenges protected the program. Gelatt says, next time, Trump could be more successful since he's likely learned from his previous mistakes.\n\nGELATT: Part of the reason that his move to end DACA was blocked by the courts was that he did it through fast procedures rather than going through a full regulatory process. I anticipate that a future Trump administration might try to end the program in a more durable way.\n\nZANDER: Gelatt says, a lot of DACA holders will probably try to rush their advance parole applications in the next few months in case Trump takes office again. But advance parole doesn't guarantee someone's return. It's issued by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. But the agency that inspects travelers at the border is customs, and they ultimately get to decide who can and can't enter the country.\n\nGELATT: So I could imagine that it would be quite scary for somebody to travel abroad on advance parole with DACA in the early days of a Trump administration, not knowing what changes were about to come.\n\nZANDER: People traveling with advance parole even now go through a lot of anxiety since their return isn't guaranteed. Galaviz went through a wide range of emotions during her trip.\n\nGALAVIZ: And just, like, seeing the people, it made me think about all the reasons why people leave, like, why my parents left.\n\nZANDER: She made it through customs and got back to the U.S. safely last month. Galaviz laughs easily, but when looking ahead and talking about the upcoming election, she becomes very somber.\n\nGALAVIZ: I'm, like, petrified about what's going to happen.\n\nZANDER: But Galaviz is accustomed to waiting for election results like this and living her life in the meantime.

        "text": "Who could potentially replace President Joe Biden?\nThe US president and his backers are scrambling to assure voters of his mental fitness after the presidential debate.\n\nCalls are mounting for US President Joe Biden to step aside as the Democratic Party candidate, following his poor performance in a presidential debate against Republican candidate Donald Trump.\n\nThe 81-year-old president\u2019s faltering presentation during the June 27 debate has sparked questions and doubts about his ability to lead for another four years. During the debate, Biden appeared to lose his train of thought and at times looked exhausted or confused.\n\nA damage control campaign has since followed, with the president and his backers scrambling to assure voters that he is fit and won\u2019t be stepping aside.\n\nBut some within the Democratic camp seem dissatisfied; the list of representatives calling for a Biden drop-out is now growing.\n\nHere\u2019s what we know about how the debate has affected Biden and who a replacement candidate might be:\n\nWhy did the debate affect Biden?\n\nThe most significant impact of Biden\u2019s debate performance is that it intensified doubts about his capacity \u2013 which now threatens his ability to win the presidential elections in November, experts note. That adds to simmering dissatisfaction with how Biden\u2019s government has handled inflation, the Gaza war and immigration on the southern border with Mexico.\n\nAn Ipsos poll showed that after the presidential debate, voter confidence in Biden\u2019s mental fitness dropped from 28 percent to 20 percent.\n\nPresidential debates have been an important part of US elections since first airing in 1960 and have proved crucial in shifting voters towards the better speaker.\n\nAfter the Sunday debate, voter preferences have shifted towards Trump by an average of 3.5 points, according to one analysis by the Brookings Institution, a US think-tank. Prior to the debate, Trump was ahead of Biden by an average of 1.5 points.\n\nAnother opinion poll by Ipsos showed that post-debate voter support for both candidates was tied at 40 percent.\n\nAnalysts say even small shifts are crucial in what\u2019s set to be a tight election in a country deeply polarised along political ideologies.\n\nWhich Democrats have called for Biden to be replaced?\n\nWithin the Democratic Party, five members of the US House of Representatives have called for Biden to step aside: Representatives Seth Moulton (Massachusetts), Lloyd Doggett (Texas), Raul Grijalva (Arizona), Mike Quigley (Illinois) and Angie Craig (Minnesota).\n\nOn Sunday, a separate group of Democrats at a virtual meeting convened by the House minority leader, Representative Hakeem Jeffries (New York), discussed how to pressure Biden to step aside, according to The Associated Press.\n\nWhat happens if Biden drops out of the race?\n\nIt\u2019s nearly unprecedented for a nominee to step down so close to the elections. If that happens, Democrats would have to field another candidate.\n\nPresident Biden could step down and simply nominate Vice President Kamala Harris to carry on, but her approval ratings have not been much higher than Biden\u2019s, casting doubt on her ability to floor Trump.\n\nHowever, Harris would inherit Biden\u2019s campaign funds, whereas any other nominees would be starting their campaigns from scratch, campaign finance lawyer Steve Roberts told The Hill.\n\nIf Biden steps down before the August 19-22 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, one of the more likely scenarios is that the party will nominate another candidate to run in his place. Democrats last used this method in 1968, after the leading candidate, Senator Robert F Kennedy, was assassinated just weeks before the convention.\n\nThe Democratic Party could also force Biden out by invoking the 25th Amendment, which provides that if the president dies, is disabled or resigns, the vice president assumes the role. The VP and a majority of Democrats in Congress could invoke the act by declaring to the speaker of the house and the Senate that the president is not fit, and should be removed. The president could contest this declaration. If the VP and a majority of lawmakers disagree, the matter would be put to a two-thirds majority vote in Congress.\n\nCould donors force Biden to quit?\n\nDonors have considerable power, but it\u2019s unclear how they might affect a potential nomination.\n\nSome donors to the Biden campaign have joined the list of people asking Biden to step down, including former PayPal CEO William \u201cBill\u201d Harris.\n\nHarris, who donated $620,000 to the Biden campaign in 2020, told reporters last week that Biden\u2019s departure is \u201cinevitable\u201d. Harris is now leading a group of donors pledging $2m to fund a series of debates among Democratic candidates that would set the stage for another candidate to be selected.\n\nSome are threatening to withhold donations to the Democrats until Biden steps down, putting pressure not just on the president, but the entire party.\n\nIn an opinion piece on the website Deadline, Hollywood producer Damon Lindelof urged fellow donors to impose a \u201cDEMbargo\u201d.\n\nLindelof wrote: \u201cWhen they text you asking for cash, text back that you\u2019re not giving them a penny and you won\u2019t change your mind until there\u2019s change at the top of the ticket.\u201d\n\nFor now, there have been no such calls from the Biden campaign\u2019s biggest donors. Political action group Future Forward USA Action and venture capital firms Greylock Partners and Sequoia Capital are the top three donors for the Biden campaign, according to the website OpenSecrets.\n\nWho could replace Biden and how would they fare against Trump?\n\nSome have put forward Michelle Obama as a likely nominee, but the former first lady has repeatedly said \u201cno\u201d. Yet 50 percent of those polled said they would vote for Obama if she were on the ticket, putting her seven points ahead of Trump.\n\nMore likely candidates, however, include:",

Image credit: Michigan State Historic Preservation Office\n\nWith Michigan poised to be a pivotal state in the 2024 presidential election, Detroiters have weighed in on their priorities for the U.S. government.\n\nCost of living and inflation is the issue Detroiters mentioned most when asked about the top issues they want the U.S. government to address, according to a new report from the University of Michigan\u2019s Detroit Metro Area Communities Study, with support from Poverty Solutions.\n\nDMACS partnered with Outlier Media to survey 1,100 Detroit residents in April about their intentions to vote and priorities for the government in 2024. Information about Detroiters\u2019 priorities was collected via open-ended questions, so residents responded in their own words without the limitations of a set of response options. Survey results were weighted to reflect the city\u2019s population as a whole.\n\nThe survey found that 20% of Detroit households cited cost of living and inflation as one of the top two priorities for federal government officials, and survey respondents called for federal action to: \u201cbring prices back down,\u201d \u201cregulate the price of food, gas, utilities,\u201d and \u201clower prices on groceries and gas.\u201d\n\nCrime and safety was the next most frequently mentioned broad issue that Detroiters want U.S. federal officials to address, with 14.8% citing it as one of their top two priorities. Health care came in third, with 14.5% of Detroiters indicating that health care access or quality should be a top priority for the U.S. government. People mentioned the need for \u201cuniversal health care,\u201d \u201cgreat health care for all without red tape,\u201d and \u201c(better support and services for) mental health.\u201d\n\nMara Cecilia Ostfeld\n\n\u201cDetroit is the largest city in Michigan and will have significant influence over the state\u2019s election outcomes for the presidential race as well as filling the U.S. Senate seat previously held by Debbie Stabenow,\u201d said Mara Ostfeld, a faculty lead for DMACS. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial to understand what Detroiters are looking for from the federal government right now.\u201d\n\nThe survey found large gaps in the importance assigned to different issues across ethnoracial groups. Cost of living and inflation is the most frequently mentioned issue for the U.S. government to address among Black (20%) and Latino Detroiters (26%), compared to 11% of white Detroiters. For white Detroiters, health care is the most frequently mentioned issue (24%); health care was also a top priority for 23% of Latino residents, compared to 12% of Black residents.\n\n\u201cDetroiters want neighborhood sustainability, economic development and a say in their communities. The federal government has an obligation to be responsive to the clear priorities laid out by Detroit residents,\u201d said Donna Givens Davidson, president and CEO of the Eastside Community Network, which develops people, places and plans for sustainable growth on Detroit\u2019s east side.\n\nLooking at priorities for the U.S. government by Detroiters\u2019 income level, cost of living and inflation remained a top priority across income groups.\n\nYucheng Fan\n\n\u201cIt may be counterintuitive, but Detroiters with higher household incomes were no less likely to mention cost of living and inflation as a top priority for U.S. elected officials than Detroiters with lower household incomes,\u201d said DMACS data manager Yucheng Fan. \u201cWe saw more variation across income levels in the degree of importance placed on homelessness, crime and safety, quality jobs, and housing\n\nEleven percent of Detroiters with annual household incomes of less than $30,000 listed homelessness as one of their top priorities for the U.S. government to address, compared to 4% of Detroiters with annual household incomes above $30,000.\n\nCrime and safety, quality jobs and housing are far less likely to be viewed as top issues for the U.S. government to address among higher-income Detroiters, relative to those with lower annual household incomes.\n\nLooking at priorities by age group, equal shares of Detroiters 65 and older (14%) want the U.S. government to prioritize addressing border and immigration policy, health care, crime and safety, and cost of living and inflation.\n\nAmong Detroiters under 65, the cost of living and inflation stood apart as the issue mentioned more than any other, with 23% of people under 40 and 21% of people aged 40-64 saying it\u2019s a top priority.",

Demographically, disengaged voters more often are younger, more often are women, and are less likely to have a college degree than politically engaged voters. Although for most of the last decade these voters have been more supportive of Donald Trump, net support among disengaged voters for Joe Biden relative to Trump has increased 16 percentage points since Trump\u2019s felony conviction.\n\nWho are disengaged voters?\n\nAlthough Americans have been characterized as uniquely engaged in civics and political society, this characterization does not apply to all voters. Politically disengaged voters \u2014 often called low information voters \u2014 can be thought of as people who might vote but do not follow politics closely and may have little civic knowledge.\n\nSo who counts as a disengaged voter? It can be a fuzzy concept, and there is no consensus on exactly how to define it. First, disengaged voters are often limited to those who say they are registered to vote, though some polling organizations have more complex ways of determining whether or not someone is likely to vote. When talking about disengagement, or having low information, academics often use brief tests of political knowledge, such as asking whether people know the length of a U.S. senator\u2019s term. Pollsters sometimes use political knowledge tests, but more often they simply ask how much people report following political news. For reference, about 20% of registered voters say they pay attention to politics \"only now and then\" or \"hardly at all,\" while the rest say they follow politics at least some of the time. But are self-reports of following political news the same as testing political knowledge? While not exactly the same, they may be effectively interchangeable for defining disengaged voters. That is, people who follow politics less will most likely have lower political knowledge, and vice versa.\n\nTo explore how similar these measures of political engagement are, a recent YouGov survey tested respondents\u2019 political knowledge and also asked them how much they pay attention to politics in general and to the 2024 election specifically. Respondents were asked 23 questions about politics in general and the 2024 presidential election, including who the Democratic and Republican candidates for president are, which political party controls the House of Representatives and which controls the Senate, which party generally supports various policies, whether the national political conventions have happened yet, and whether each presidential candidate is facing legal issues such as being convicted of a crime.\n\nIf we think of disengaged voters as those who do not follow politics and lack political knowledge, then people who say they have lower political engagement should score lower, on average, on political knowledge tests. Results support this: Registered voters who say they follow political news only now and then or hardly at all score an average of 54% on the political knowledge test, almost 20 points lower than the average score for all registered voters (72%). Similarly, those who are paying little attention to the 2024 election score 56%. The largest percentage of registered voters know the date of the next U.S. election, with 95% correctly identifying it as this year. The fewest voters \u2014 40% \u2014 knew that at the time of the poll, the Democratic vice presidential candidate had been officially announced (and 88% of them knew it was Kamala Harris).\n\nPolitical knowledge scores, attention to political news in general, and attention to the 2024 election each correlate with each other at a level of above r = 0.5, meaning that people who pay more attention to politics are more likely to score highly on political knowledge tests and vice versa. Essentially, these measures increase together, indicating that they are closely related aspects of political engagement. Despite sometimes being conflated with low education, the extent to which one follows political news is a better predictor of political knowledge test scores than education level is, aligning with previous research finding that disengaged or low information voters are not merely those with less education.",

        "text": "The American Presidency Project\n2024 GOP PLATFORM\n\nMAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\n\nDedication:\n\nTo the Forgotten Men and Women of America\n\nPREAMBLE\n\nAmerica First:\n\nA Return to Common Sense\n\nOur Nation's History is filled with the stories of brave men and women who gave everything they had to build America into the Greatest Nation in the History of the World. Generations of American Patriots have summoned the American Spirit of Strength, Determination, and Love of Country to overcome seemingly insurmountable challenges. The American People have proven time and again that we can overcome any obstacle and any force pitted against us.\n\nIn the early days of our Republic, the Founding Generation defeated what was then the most powerful Empire the World had ever seen. In the 20th Century, America vanquished Nazism and Fascism, and then triumphed over Soviet Communism after forty-four years of the Cold War.\n\nBut now we are a Nation in SERIOUS DECLINE. Our future, our identity, and our very way of life are under threat like never before. Today we must once again call upon the same American Spirit that led us to prevail through every challenge of the past if we are going to lead our Nation to a brighter future.\n\nFor decades, our politicians sold our jobs and livelihoods to the highest bidders overseas with unfair Trade Deals and a blind faith in the siren song of globalism. They insulated themselves from criticism and the consequences of their own bad actions, allowing our Borders to be overrun, our cities to be overtaken by crime, our System of Justice to be weaponized, and our young people to develop a sense of hopelessness and despair. They rejected our History and our Values. Quite simply, they did everything in their power to destroy our Country.\n\nIn 2016, President Donald J. Trump was elected as an unapologetic Champion of the American People. He reignited the American Spirit and called on us to renew our National Pride. His Policies spurred Historic Economic Growth, Job Creation, and a Resurgence of American Manufacturing. President Trump and the Republican Party led America out of the pessimism induced by decades of failed leadership, showing us that the American People want Greatness for our Country again.\n\nYet after nearly four years of the Biden administration, America is now rocked by Raging Inflation, Open Borders, Rampant Crime, Attacks on our Children, and Global Conflict, Chaos, and Instability.\n\nLike the Heroes who built and defended this Nation before us, we will never give up. We will restore our Nation of, by, and for the People. We will Make America Great Again.\n\nWe will be a Nation based on Truth, Justice, and Common Sense.\n\nCommon Sense tells us clearly, in President Trump's words, that \"If we don't have a Border, we don't have a Country.\" Restoring sensible Border Security and Immigration Policy requires many steps, all of which would have been and indeed were taken for granted by prior Generations as obviously necessary and good. We must secure our Southern Border by completing the Border Wall that President Trump started. Hundreds of miles have already been built and work magnificently. The remaining Wall construction can be completed quickly, effectively, and inexpensively. We must also vigilantly check those who enter our Country by other routes and ensure that no one can enter our Country who does not have the Legal Right to do so, and we must deport the millions of illegal Migrants who Joe Biden has deliberately encouraged to invade our Country. We will start by prioritizing the most dangerous criminals and working with local Police. We must not allow Biden's Migrant Invasion to alter our Country. It must not stand. Under the Trump Administration and a Republican Congress, it will be defeated immediately.\n\nCommon Sense tells us clearly that if we don't have Domestic Manufacturing with low Inflation, not only will our Economy\u2014and even our Military Equipment and Supplies\u2014be at the mercy of Foreign Nations, but our Towns, Communities, and People cannot thrive. The Republican Party must return to its roots as the Party of Industry, Manufacturing, Infrastructure, and Workers. President Trump's economic policy to end Inflation and return Manufacturing Jobs is not only what the American Economy and American Workers need right now, it is also what they want right now.\n\nCommon Sense tells us clearly that we must unleash American Energy if we want to destroy Inflation and rapidly bring down prices, build the Greatest Economy in History, revive our Defense Industrial Base, fuel Emerging Industries, and establish the United States as the Manufacturing Superpower of the World. We will DRILL, BABY, DRILL and we will become Energy Independent, and even Dominant again. The United States has more liquid gold under our feet than any other Nation, and it's not even close. The Republican Party will harness that potential to power our future.\n\nCommon Sense tells us clearly that if we don't have a Strong Military, we won't be able to defend our interests and we will be at the mercy of Hostile Nations. The Policy of the Republican Party must be to ensure that America's Military is the strongest and best-equipped in the World\u2014and that our Government uses that great strength sparingly, and only in clear instances where our National Interests are threatened.\n\nCommon Sense tells us clearly that the Republican Party must stand for Equal Treatment for All. Likewise, the Republican Party must ensure the equal application of law to all regardless of political affiliation or personal beliefs. Recent Democrat-led political persecutions threaten to destroy 250 years of American Principle and Practice and must be stopped.\n\nAmerica needs determined Republican Leadership at every level of Government to address the core threats to our very survival: Our disastrously Open Border, our weakened Economy, crippling restrictions on American Energy Production, our depleted Military, attacks on the American System of Justice, and much more.\n\nTo make clear our commitment, we offer to the American people the 2024 GOP Platform to Make America Great Again! It is a forward-looking Agenda that begins with the following twenty promises that we will accomplish very quickly when we win the White House and Republican Majorities in the House and Senate.\n\nSEAL THE BORDER, AND STOP THE MIGRANT INVASION CARRY OUT THE LARGEST DEPORTATION OPERATION IN AMERICAN HISTORY END INFLATION, AND MAKE AMERICA AFFORDABLE AGAIN MAKE AMERICA THE DOMINANT ENERGY PRODUCER IN THE WORLD, BY FAR!

GOVERNMENT OF, BY, AND FOR THE PEOPLE.\n\n10. RETURN TO PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH.\n\nCHAPTER ONE: DEFEAT INFLATION AND QUICKLY BRING DOWN ALL PRICES\n\nOur Commitment:\n\nThe Republican Party will reverse the worst Inflation crisis in four decades that has crushed the middle class, devastated family budgets, and pushed the dream of homeownership out of reach for millions. We will defeat Inflation, tackle the cost-of-living crisis, improve fiscal sanity, restore price stability, and quickly bring down prices.\n\nInflation is a crushing tax on American families. History shows that Inflation will not magically disappear while policies remain the same. We commit to unleashing American Energy, reining in wasteful spending, cutting excessive Regulations, securing our Borders, and restoring Peace through Strength. Together, we will restore Prosperity, ensure Economic Security, and build a brighter future for American Workers and their families. Our dedication to these Policies will make America stronger, more resilient, and more prosperous than ever before.\n\n1. Unleash American Energy\n\nUnder President Trump, the U.S. became the Number One Producer of Oil and Natural Gas in the World \u2014 and we will soon be again by lifting restrictions on American Energy Production and terminating the Socialist Green New Deal. Republicans will unleash Energy Production from all sources, including nuclear, to immediately slash Inflation and power American homes, cars, and factories with reliable, abundant, and affordable Energy.\n\n2. Rein in Wasteful Federal Spending\n\nRepublicans will immediately stabilize the Economy by slashing wasteful Government spending and promoting Economic Growth.\n\n3. Cut Costly and Burdensome Regulations\n\nRepublicans will reinstate President Trump's Deregulation Policies, which saved Americans $11,000 per household, and end Democrats' regulatory onslaught that disproportionately harms low- and middle-income households.\n\n4. Stop Illegal Immigration\n\nRepublicans will secure the Border, deport Illegal Aliens, and reverse the Democrats' Open Borders Policies that have driven up the cost of Housing, Education, and Healthcare for American families.\n\n5. Restore Peace through Strength\n\nWar breeds Inflation while geopolitical stability brings price stability. Republicans will end the global chaos and restore Peace through Strength, reducing geopolitical risks and lowering commodity prices.\n\nCHAPTER TWO: SEAL THE BORDER, AND STOP THE MIGRANT INVASION\n\nOur Commitment:\n\nRepublicans offer an aggressive plan to stop the open-border policies that have opened the floodgates to a tidal wave of illegal Aliens, deadly drugs, and Migrant Crime. We will end the Invasion at the Southern Border, restore Law and Order, protect American Sovereignty, and deliver a Safe and Prosperous Future for all Americans.\n\n1. Secure the Border\n\nRepublicans will restore every Border Policy of the Trump administration and halt all releases of Illegal Aliens into the interior. We will complete the Border Wall, shift massive portions of Federal Law Enforcement to Immigration Enforcement, and use advanced technology to monitor and secure the Border. We will use all resources needed to stop the Invasion\u2014including moving thousands of Troops currently stationed overseas to our own Southern Border. We will deploy the U.S. Navy to impose a full Fentanyl Blockade on the waters of our Region\u2014boarding and inspecting ships to look for fentanyl and fentanyl precursors. Before we defend the Borders of Foreign Countries, we must first secure the Border of our Country.\n\n2. Enforce Immigration Laws\n\nRepublicans will strengthen ICE, increase penalties for illegal entry and overstaying Visas, and reinstate \"Remain in Mexico\" and other Policies that helped reduce Illegal Immigration by historic lows in President Trump's first term. We will also invoke the Alien Enemies Act to remove all known or suspected gang members, drug dealers, or cartel members from the United States, ending the scourge of Illegal Alien gang violence once and for all. We will bring back the Travel Ban, and use Title 42 to end the child trafficking crisis by returning all trafficked children to their families in their Home Countries immediately.\n\n3. Begin Largest Deportation Program in American History\n\nPresident Trump and Republicans will reverse the Democrats' destructive Open Borders Policies that have allowed criminal gangs and Illegal Aliens from around the World to roam the United States without consequences. The Republican Party is committed to sending Illegal Aliens back home and removing those who have violated our Laws.\n\n4. Strict Vetting\n\nRepublicans will use existing Federal Law to keep foreign Christian-hating Communists, Marxists, and Socialists out of America. Those who join our Country must love our Country. We will use extreme vetting to ensure that jihadists and jihadist sympathizers are not admitted.\n\n5. Stop Sanctuary Cities\n\nRepublicans will cut federal Funding to sanctuary jurisdictions that release dangerous Illegal Alien criminals onto our streets, rather than handing them over to ICE. We will require local cooperation with Federal Immigration Enforcement.\n\n6. Ensure Our Legal Immigration System Puts American Workers First\n\nRepublicans will prioritize Merit-based immigration, ensuring those admitted to our Country contribute positively to our Society and Economy, and never become a drain on Public Resources. We will end Chain Migration, and put American Workers first!\n\nCHAPTER THREE: BUILD THE GREATEST ECONOMY IN HISTORY\n\nOur Commitment:\n\nAmerican Workers are the most productive, talented, and innovative on Earth. The only thing holding them back is the suffocating policies of the Democrat Party. Our America First Economic Agenda rests on five pillars: Slashing Regulations, cutting Taxes, securing Fair Trade Deals, ensuring Reliable and Abundant Low Cost Energy, and championing Innovation. Together, we will restore Economic Prosperity and Opportunity for all Americans.\n\n1. Cut Regulations\n\nRepublicans will slash Regulations that stifle Jobs, Freedom, Innovation and make everything more expensive. We will implement Transparency and Common Sense in rulemaking.\n\n2. Make Trump Tax Cuts Permanent and No Tax on Tips\n\nRepublicans will make permanent the provisions of the Trump Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that doubled the standard deduction, expanded the Child Tax Credit, and spurred Economic Growth for all Americans. We will eliminate Taxes on Tips for millions of Restaurant and Hospitality Workers, and pursue additional Tax Cuts.\n\n3. Fair and Reciprocal Trade Deals\n\nRepublicans will continue forging an America First Trade Policy as set forth in Chapter 5, standing up to Countries that cheat and prioritizing American Producers over Foreign Outsourcers. We will bring our critical Supply Chains back home. President Trump turned American Trade Policy around, protecting U.S. Producers, and renegotiating failed agreements.\n\n4. Reliable and Abundant Low Cost Energy\n\nRepublicans will increase Energy Production across the board, streamline permitting, and end market-distorting restrictions on Oil, Natural Gas, and Coal. The Republican Party will once again make America Energy Independent, and then Energy Dominant, lowering Energy prices even below the record lows achieved during President Trump's first term.\n\n5. Champion Innovation\n\nRepublicans will pave the way for future Economic Greatness by leading the World in Emerging Industries.\n\nCrypto\n\nRepublicans will end Democrats' unlawful and unAmerican Crypto crackdown and oppose the creation of a Central Bank Digital Currency. We will defend the right to mine Bitcoin, and ensure every American has the right to self-custody of their Digital Assets, and transact free from Government Surveillance and Control.\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI)\n\nWe will repeal Joe Biden's dangerous Executive Order that hinders AI Innovation, and imposes Radical Leftwing ideas on the development of this technology. In its place, Republicans support AI Development rooted in Free Speech and Human Flourishing.\n\nExpanding Freedom, Prosperity and Safety in Space\n\nUnder Republican Leadership, the United States will create a robust Manufacturing Industry in Near Earth Orbit, send American Astronauts back to the Moon, and onward to Mars, and enhance partnerships with the rapidly expanding Commercial Space sector to revolutionize our ability to access, live in, and develop assets in Space.\n\nCHAPTER FOUR: BRING BACK THE AMERICAN DREAM AND MAKE IT AFFORDABLE AGAIN FOR FAMILIES, YOUNG PEOPLE, AND EVERYONE\n\nOur Commitment:\n\nRepublicans offer a plan to make the American Dream affordable again. We commit to reducing Housing, Education, and Healthcare costs, while lowering everyday expenses, and increasing opportunities.\n\n1. Housing Affordability\n\nTo help new home buyers, Republicans will reduce mortgage rates by slashing Inflation, open limited portions of Federal Lands to allow for new home construction, promote homeownership through Tax Incentives and support for first-time buyers, and cut unnecessary Regulations that raise housing costs.\n\n2. Accessible Higher Education\n\nTo reduce the cost of Higher Education, Republicans will support the creation of additional, drastically more affordable alternatives to a traditional four-year College degree.\n\n3. Affordable Healthcare\n\nHealthcare and prescription drug costs are out of control. Republicans will increase Transparency, promote Choice and Competition, and expand access to new Affordable Healthcare and prescription drug options. We will protect Medicare, and ensure Seniors receive the care they need without being burdened by excessive costs.\n\n4. Lower Everyday Costs\n\nRepublicans will reduce the Regulatory burden, lower Energy costs, and promote Economic Policies that drive down the cost of living and prices for everyday goods and services.\n\nCHAPTER FIVE: PROTECT AMERICAN WORKERS AND FARMERS FROM UNFAIR TRADE\n\nOur Commitment:\n\nThe Republican Party stands for a patriotic \"America First\" Economic Policy. Republicans offer a robust plan to protect American Workers, Farmers, and Industries from unfair Foreign Competition. We commit to rebalancing Trade, securing Strategic Independence, and revitalizing Manufacturing. We will prioritize Domestic Production, and ensure National Independence in essential goods and services. Together, we will build a Strong, Self-reliant, and Prosperous America.\n\n1. Rebalance Trade\n\nOur Trade deficit in goods has grown to over $1 Trillion Dollars a year. Republicans will support baseline Tariffs on Foreign-made goods, pass the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act, and respond to unfair Trading practices. As Tariffs on Foreign Producers go up, Taxes on American Workers, Families, and Businesses can come down.\n\n2. Secure Strategic Independence from China\n\nRepublicans will revoke China's Most Favored Nation status, phase out imports of essential goods, and stop China from buying American Real Estate and Industries.\n\n3. Save the American Auto Industry\n\nRepublicans will revive the U.S. Auto Industry by reversing harmful Regulations, canceling Biden's Electric Vehicle and other Mandates, and preventing the importation of Chinese vehicles.\n\n4. Bring Home Critical Supply Chains\n\nRepublicans will bring critical Supply Chains back to the U.S., ensuring National Security and Economic Stability, while also creating Jobs and raising Wages for American Workers.\n\n5. Buy American and Hire American\n\nRepublicans will strengthen Buy American and Hire American Policies, banning companies that outsource jobs from doing business with the Federal Government.\n\n6. Become the Manufacturing Superpower\n\nBy protecting American Workers from unfair Foreign Competition and unleashing American Energy, Republicans will restore American Manufacturing, creating Jobs, Wealth, and Investment.\n\nCHAPTER SIX: PROTECT SENIORS\n\nOur Commitment:\n\nPresident Trump has made absolutely clear that he will not cut one penny from Medicare or Social Security. American Citizens work hard their whole lives, contributing to Social Security and Medicare. These programs are promises to our Seniors, ensuring they can live their golden years with dignity. Republicans will protect these vital programs and ensure Economic Stability. We will work with our Great Seniors, in order to allow them to be active and healthy. We commit to safeguarding the future for our Seniors and all American families.\n\n1. Protect Social Security\n\nSocial Security is a lifeline for millions of Retirees, yet corrupt politicians have robbed Social Security to fund their pet projects. Republicans will restore Economic Stability to ensure the long-term sustainability of Social Security.\n\n2. Strengthen Medicare\n\nRepublicans will protect Medicare's finances from being financially crushed by the Democrat plan to add tens of millions of new illegal immigrants to the rolls of Medicare. We vow to strengthen Medicare for future generations.\n\n3. Support Active and Healthy Living\n\nRepublicans will support increased focus on Chronic Disease prevention and management, Long-Term Care, and Benefit flexibility. We will expand access to Primary Care and support Policies that help Seniors remain in their homes and maintain Financial Security.\n\n4. Protect Care at Home for the Elderly\n\nRepublicans will shift resources back to at-home Senior Care, overturn disincentives that lead to Care Worker shortages, and support unpaid Family Caregivers through Tax Credits and reduced red tape.\n\n5. Protect Economic Foundations for Supporting Seniors\n\nRepublicans will tackle Inflation, unleash American Energy, restore Economic Growth, and secure our Borders to preserve Social Security and Medicare funding for the next Generation and beyond. We will ensure these programs remain solvent long into the future by reversing harmful Democrat policies and unleashing a new Economic Boom.\n\nCHAPTER SEVEN: CULTIVATE GREAT K-12 SCHOOLS LEADING TO GREAT JOBS AND GREAT LIVES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE\n\nOur Commitment:\n\nRepublicans offer a plan to cultivate great K-12 schools, ensure safe learning environments free from political meddling, and restore Parental Rights. We commit to an Education System that empowers students, supports families, and promotes American Values. Our Education System must prepare students for successful lives and well-paying jobs.\n\n1. Great Principals and Great Teachers\n\nRepublicans will support schools that focus on Excellence and Parental Rights. We will support ending Teacher Tenure, adopting Merit pay, and allowing various publicly supported Educational models.\n\n2. Universal School Choice\n\nRepublicans believe families should be empowered to choose the best Education for their children. We support Universal School Choice in every State in America. We will expand 529 Education Savings Accounts and support Homeschooling Families equally.\n\n3. Prepare Students for Jobs and Careers\n\nRepublicans will emphasize Education to prepare students for great jobs and careers, supporting project-based learning and schools that offer meaningful work experience. We will expose politicized education models and fund proven career training programs.\n\n4. Safe, Secure, and Drug-Free Schools\n\nRepublicans will support overhauling standards on school discipline, advocate for immediate suspension of violent students, and support hardening schools to help keep violence away from our places of learning.\n\n5. Restore Parental Rights\n\nRepublicans will restore Parental Rights in Education, and enforce our Civil Rights Laws to stop schools from discriminating on the basis of Race. We trust Parents!\n\n6. Knowledge and Skills, Not CRT and Gender Indoctrination\n\nRepublicans will ensure children are taught fundamentals like Reading, History, Science, and Math, not Leftwing propaganda. We will defund schools that engage in inappropriate political indoctrination of our children using Federal Taxpayer Dollars.\n\n7. Promote Love of Country with Authentic Civics Education\n\nRepublicans will reinstate the 1776 Commission, promote Fair and Patriotic Civics Education, and veto efforts to nationalize Civics Education. We will support schools that teach America's Founding Principles and Western Civilization.\n\n8. Freedom to Pray\n\nRepublicans will champion the First Amendment Right to Pray and Read the Bible in school, and stand up to those who violate the Religious Freedoms of American students.\n\n9. Return Education to the States\n\nThe United States spends more money per pupil on Education than any other Country in the World, and yet we are at the bottom of every educational list in terms of results. We are going to close the Department of Education in Washington, D.C. and send it back to the States, where it belongs, and let the States run our educational system as it should be run. Our Great Teachers, who are so important to the future wellbeing of our Country, will be cherished and protected by the Republican Party so that they can do the job of educating our students that they so dearly want to do. It is our goal to bring Education in the United States to the highest level, one that it has never attained before!\n\nCHAPTER EIGHT: BRING COMMON SENSE TO GOVERNMENT AND RENEW THE PILLARS OF AMERICAN CIVILIZATION\n\nOur Commitment:\n\nRepublicans offer a plan to renew American Civilization with Common Sense Policies that supports families, restores Law and Order, cares for Veterans, promotes beauty, and honors American History. We commit to strengthening the Foundations of our Society for a brighter future.\n\n1. Empower American Families\n\nRepublicans will promote a Culture that values the Sanctity of Marriage, the blessings of childhood, the foundational role of families, and supports working parents. We will end policies that punish families.\n\n2. Rebuild Our Cities and Restore Law and Order\n\nRepublicans will restore safety in our neighborhoods by replenishing Police Departments, restoring Common Sense Policing, and protecting Officers from frivolous lawsuits. We will stand up to Marxist Prosecutors, vigorously defend the Right of every American to live in peace, and we will compassionately address homelessness to restore order to our streets.\n\n3. Make Washington D.C. the Safest and Most Beautiful Capital City\n\nRepublicans will reassert greater Federal Control over Washington, DC to restore Law and Order in our Capital City, and ensure Federal Buildings and Monuments are well-maintained.\n\n4. Take Care of Our Veterans\n\nRepublicans will end luxury housing and Taxpayer benefits for Illegal Immigrants and use those savings to shelter and treat homeless Veterans. We will restore Trump Administration reforms to expand Veterans' Healthcare Choices, protect Whistleblowers, and hold accountable poorly performing employees not giving our Veterans the care they deserve.\n\n5. Make Colleges and Universities Sane and Affordable\n\nRepublicans will fire Radical Left accreditors, drive down Tuition costs, restore Due Process protections, and pursue Civil Rights cases against Schools that discriminate.\n\n6. Combat Antisemitism\n\nRepublicans condemn antisemitism, and support revoking Visas of Foreign Nationals who support terrorism and jihadism. We will hold accountable those who perpetrate violence against Jewish people.\n\n7. Overcome the Crisis in Liberal Arts Education\n\nRepublicans support the restoration of Classic Liberal Arts Education.\n\n8. Restore American Beauty\n\nRepublicans will promote beauty in Public Architecture and preserve our Natural Treasures. We will build cherished symbols of our Nation, and restore genuine Conservation efforts.\n\n9. Honor American History\n\nRepublicans celebrate our Great American Heroes and are proud that the Story of America makes everyone free. We will organize a National Celebration to mark the 250th Anniversary of the Founding of the United States of America.\n\nCHAPTER NINE: GOVERNMENT OF, BY, AND FOR THE PEOPLE\n\nOur Commitment:\n\nRepublicans will offer a clear, precise, and USA oriented plan to stop the Radical Left Democrats' Weaponization of Government and its Assault on American Liberty. We will restore Government of, by, and for the People, ensuring Accountability, protecting Individual Liberties, and fixing our once very corrupt Elections. We commit to upholding the Constitution of the United States, appointing judges who respect the rule of law, and defending the Rights of all Americans to Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. We will maintain the Supreme Court as it was always meant to be, at 9 Justices. We will not allow the Democrat Party to increase this number, as they would like to do, by 4, 6, 8, 10, and even 12 Justices. We will block them at every turn.\n\n1. Republicans Will Stop Woke and Weaponized Government\n\nWe will hold accountable those who have misused the power of Government to unjustly prosecute their Political Opponents. We will declassify Government records, root out wrongdoers, and fire corrupt employees.\n\n2. Republicans Will Dismantle Censorship & Protect Free Speech\n\nWe will ban the Federal Government from colluding with anyone to censor Lawful Speech, defund institutions engaged in censorship, and hold accountable all bureaucrats involved with illegal censoring. We will protect Free Speech online.\n\n3. Republicans Will Defend Religious Liberty\n\nWe are the defenders of the First Amendment Right to Religious Liberty. It protects the Right not only to Worship according to the dictates of Conscience, but also to act in accordance with those Beliefs, not just in places of Worship, but in everyday life. Our ranks include men and women from every Faith and Tradition, and we respect the Right of every American to follow his or her deeply held Beliefs. To protect Religious Liberty, Republicans support a new Federal Task Force on Fighting Anti-Christian Bias that will investigate all forms of illegal discrimination, harassment, and persecution against Christians in America.\n\n4. Republicans Will Protect and Defend a Vote of the People, from within the States, on the Issue of Life\n\nWe proudly stand for families and Life. We believe that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no person can be denied Life or Liberty without Due Process, and that the States are, therefore, free to pass Laws protecting those Rights. After 51 years, because of us, that power has been given to the States and to a vote of the People. We will oppose Late Term Abortion, while supporting mothers and policies that advance Prenatal Care, access to Birth Control, and IVF (fertility treatments).\n\n5. Republicans Will End Left-wing Gender Insanity\n\nWe will keep men out of women's sports, ban Taxpayer funding for sex change surgeries, and stop Taxpayer-funded Schools from promoting gender transition, reverse Biden's radical rewrite of Title IX Education Regulations, and restore protections for women and girls.\n\n6.

        "text": "French Parliamentary Elections 2024: Macron Faces Reality Check and Limits to His Vision\nAll eyes were on France this weekend as the country voted on the new composition of the parliament. Following the defeat of his party in the European Parliament elections in June, French President Emmanuel Macron called snap elections in a bid to shore up his support and ensure he could continue his second term from a position of power. The first round of these snap elections a week ago resulted in disaster and panic for Macron\u2019s centrist party, which slumped to third place. The National Rally, France\u2019s far-right party that has openly questioned the country\u2019s NATO and EU memberships, was the clear winner from the first round as the top party, with widespread concerns they would perform as well in round two. In the last week, Macron\u2019s centrists and the left alliance, the New Popular Front (NPF), scrambled with one goal\u2013prevent the National Rally from entering government. In the end, the two parties kept the National Rally from gaining power, but now Macron is likely facing a hung parliament and political gridlock. In the coming weeks, Macron and the left-wing alliance will either try to form a minority government, enter into an uneasy coalition with a cohabitation government (with the prime minister role held by the left), or a technocratic government of experts may emerge as the only viable path forward. The rebalance of power after the elections will limit Macron's ambitions and leadership, impacting attempts to create a more geopolitical European Union and limiting French support for Ukraine.\n\nWhat led Macron to call snap elections?\n\nWhat led Macron to call for parliamentary elections in the first place? He was only recently voted into his second term in 2022 and the next elections are not scheduled until 2027. The European Parliament elections in June and his party\u2019s poor performance prompted the decision, amidst the groundswell of the far-right National Rally party, which came in first with 31.4% of the vote. The National Rally received the highest vote share in the party\u2019s history and twice as much as Macron\u2019s party in the European Parliament elections. Macron\u2019s unexpected decision to call for snap legislative elections in the aftermath of this historic defeat took everyone by surprise. In the 2022 election cycle, Macron\u2019s coalition failed to win an outright parliamentary majority, leading to difficulty passing certain bills. To pass controversial bills like his pension reform, Macron has increasingly had to bypass Parliament and resort to presidential decree, which has provoked outrage in opposition parties and in public opinion.\n\nWhat did he hope to achieve with these snap parliamentary elections? One theory holds that Macron was gambling that he could defeat the \u201cextremist\u201d parties by exposing them to the government. As Marine Le Pen, leader of the National Rally, is increasingly seen as a viable candidate for president in 2027 with Macron unable to stand for a third term, this election forced her party into the limelight ahead of this critical presidential election. Out of office, both the hard left and the far-right have been able to rail against Macron\u2019s policies and make promises of their own. Macron\u2019s plan could have been to bet that once in office, they will run into constraints and may find themselves unable to deliver on their promises, or risk being viewed as incompetent. The rationale was that relinquishing some power now may give Macron\u2019s party a better chance of retaining power in 2027 for someone else from Macron\u2019s centrist party to run for office.\n\nAnother theory suggests France might soon have been forced to the polls anyway. Every time Macron passes a law by presidential decree, under article 49.3 of the French Constitution the Parliament can hold a vote of confidence in his government. Perhaps Macron considered that the government may not have survived another vote of confidence, and he judged better to call for snap elections himself rather than being pushed into it. Macron was under no obligation to dissolve Parliament, even if the European vote reduced his credibility for the three remaining years of his presidential term. He, however, believed that a dissolution had become inevitable and that a snap election was the only way to respect the will of the people. Macron presented this election to voters as a stark choice between him or the political extremes.\n\nFrance votes and rejects the far-right\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, the left-wing alliance shocked onlookers and took the top place in the parliamentary elections. No single party had an outright majority, but the centrists and leftists succeeded in bumping the far-right from first place to third place. The National Rally party still gained more than 50 seats since France last held parliamentary elections in 2022\u2013a worrying trend showing the party may not have won this battle, but the war is far from over.\n\nFrance now finds itself in a state of political paralysis and gridlock. Macron\u2019s Prime Minister, Gabriel Attal, offered his resignation but Macron asked him to help oversee a caretaker government through the Olympics. In the ensuing weeks, a new prime minister from the left-wing New Popular Front will be chosen, which leads to what is called a cohabitation in France. A cohabitation between a president from one party and a prime minister from another is uncommon in modern French political history. It happened most recently when Jacques Chirac, a center-right Gaullist, governed with a Socialist prime minister, Lionel Jospin, between 1997 and 2002. Although the ideological discrepancy between a president and a prime minister would have been more severe if the prime minister was from the National Rally, the far-left may prove equally difficult to cooperate with for Macron. The New Popular Front, consisting of multiple left-leaning parties encompassing a wide array of disparate views, did not receive enough votes for a majority government. In the ensuing weeks, a minority government may attempt to govern (with the possibility of a vote of no confidence in the National Assembly). The NPF has ruled out entering into a coalition government with the centrists. They will seek to implement their agenda, including radical reforms to the French economy in direct opposition to Macron\u2019s recent changes to the retirement age and pension reform. The left-wing alliance were united under a common banner to prevent the National Rally from winning, but now their internal divisions are already on display as they decide who to put forward as their prime minister.\n\nThe choice of prime minister will directly impact Macron\u2019s leadership at home and abroad. There is a division of labor between the president and the prime minister in France. The former has the monopoly over foreign policy while the latter oversees domestic policy. The prime minister has core national defense responsibilities, and control over the budget and the administration. While the president has broad abilities to govern by presidential decree, the approval of Parliament, especially of the National Assembly, is required on most major domestic policy changes and key pieces of legislation, including spending bills. Moreover, the National Assembly members can topple a French cabinet with a no-confidence vote, and it gets the final word if the two houses of Parliament disagree on a bill. The composition of the National Assembly therefore determines how France is governed. Although Macron would retain some powers over foreign policy and would remain commander-in-chief, the next prime minister would likely constrain Macron. Fundamentally, the new prime minister would likely come from the left-wing alliance with different priorities and policies running in parallel or at odds with Macron\u2019s. This state of paralysis will impact Macron\u2019s leadership on the EU level and limit the numerous initiatives he has undertaken to increase European strategic autonomy.\n\nWhat does this mean for Macron\u2019s vision for Europe?\n\nDespite the National Rally not coming out on top, Macron will still confront a Parliament questioning his policies. On the EU agenda, Macron has been energetically pro-European, and has been seen as a major driver of strengthening European defense cooperation, including the European pillar of NATO. Macron\u2019s view is that the EU is being severely tested by the Russian war in Ukraine, and that the way forward is to unite and pool its military and industrial resources. This view about the dire need to defend and support Ukraine is overall shared by the New Popular Front, despite some nuances and disagreements between the parties forming the coalition. However, the EU agenda of the New Popular Front differs from the President\u2019s on a number of issues, such as trade, the Common Agriculture Policy, the fight against climate change, and taxation. Indeed, the left-wing alliance is more radical and ambitious, but the reality is that it would be even more complex to reach political consensus on those files with the new fragmented National Assembly. When it comes to the National Rally\u2019s agenda, they have stated nations should reassert themselves against European federalism and against globalization. The party wants to strictly control borders, resist what they denounce as \u201cpunitive\u201d ecological measures emanating from Brussels that it says drive up prices, and prevent what it sees as the dilution of nationhood through immigration. The National Rally is overall skeptical of France\u2019s engagement with both the EU and NATO. However, without an actively engaged France, both would be significantly weakened, especially the EU. Macron\u2019s gamble\u2013likely leading to institutional blockade\u2013therefore risked plunging France into political, social, and economic turmoil.\n\nFrance is not the only country reeling from the recent European Parliament elections\u2013the German Chancellor Scholz\u2019s governing three-party coalition suffered a crushing blow as well. The fact that France could be facing a prolonged governmental crisis is bad news for the Franco-German engine of the EU. As EU institutions are transitioning to a new Commission with the new five year-mandate, the EU will need strong support from member states, especially France, to tackle pressing global challenges. The newly revitalized Weimar Triangle format\u2013 that includes France, Germany, and Poland\u2013will be under increased strain. The triumvirate will need to rise above the fallout of the European Parliament elections to support Ukraine, EU enlargement, institutional reform to make an enlarged union function more effectively, strengthen the EU defense industry, and the next seven-year budget. A weakened or constrained government in France and Germany is not a good sign for EU progress on any of those issues.\n\nAlthough the elections could have gone much worse for President Macron, this by no means was a victory for his centrist party nor for his vision of a stronger Europe. Macron\u2019s centrists and the left-wing New Popular Front succeeded in keeping the National Rally from fully enfeebling Macron\u2019s next three years in the presidency. Once the dust settles and a new prime minister is appointed, Macron will have to determine how much of his vision he can act on and he will likely need to limit some of his ambition. Ultimately, the National Rally has been defeated but is not gone forever, there is a very real chance that their wave of support will continue to gain momentum on the way to the next major elections in 2027.",

        "text": "Democrats look towards Kamala Harris\nDemocrats look to Kamala Harris - but could she beat Trump?\n\nBBC\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, US Vice-President Kamala Harris sat on stage at a black cultural festival in New Orleans, talking about her life story and what she felt she had achieved in the White House. It was the kind of event that the first female, black and South Asian American vice-president has regularly attended throughout her three-and-a-half years as Joe Biden\u2019s deputy, usually trailed by a small press pack dwarfed by that which follows the president himself. But as panicked Democrats a thousand miles away in Washington weighed replacing 81-year-old Joe Biden as the party\u2019s candidate for November\u2019s election following his woeful and sometimes incomprehensible debate performance against Donald Trump, the number of reporters trailing Ms Harris had swelled to dozens. On stage and through her travels this weekend, the vice-president did not address swirling questions about Mr Biden\u2019s fitness for office and whether he should withdraw and hand the baton to her. But in discussing ambition and how to forge your own path with her audience in New Orleans, she encouraged the crowd not to listen to naysayers. \u201cPeople in your life will tell you, though, it\u2019s not your time. It\u2019s not your turn. Nobody like you has done it before,\" she said. \"Don\u2019t you ever listen to that.\" Since the disastrous CNN debate on 27 June, she has repeatedly defended her boss, arguing that his record as president shouldn\u2019t be outweighed by 90 minutes on a debate stage. Mr Biden himself has struck a defiant tone and fiercely insisted that he will remain the nominee. Yet as calls grow louder for the president to step aside, some high-profile Democrats are unifying behind 59-year-old Ms Harris as the natural candidate to replace him. On Sunday, congressman Adam Schiff of California told NBC's Meet The Press that either Mr Biden had to be able to \u201cwin overwhelmingly or he has to pass the torch to someone who can\u201d. Kamala Harris, he added, could \u201cvery well win overwhelmingly\u201d against Trump. That\u2019s a proposition that has raised eyebrows among some Democrats, including Biden allies, who see in Ms Harris a vice-president who failed in her bid for the 2020 Democratic nomination before the first ballot was even cast and who has struggled with an uneven record and low approval ratings throughout her time in the White House. Against that, senior Democratic lawmakers like Mr Schiff and South Carolina congressman Jim Clyburn have been floating Ms Harris as the obvious successor should Mr Biden ultimately bow to party pressure.\n\nGetty Images Some Democratic heavyweights have thrown their support behind Kamala Harris should Joe Biden step aside\n\nSupporters point to a handful of polls that suggest she would perform better than the president in a hypothetical match-up against Donald Trump, and they argue she has the national profile, campaign infrastructure and appeal to younger voters that could make the transition seamless four months before election day. An elevation to the top of the ticket would be a remarkable turnaround for a woman not long ago seen as a political weakness by senior figures in the Biden White House. Even Mr Biden himself reportedly described her as a \u201cwork in progress\" during their first months in office. But Jamal Simmons, a longtime Democratic strategist and Harris\u2019s former communications director, said she had long been underestimated. \u201cWhether she\u2019s a partner to the president or she has to lead the ticket, she is somebody who Republicans and the Trump campaign need to take seriously,\u201d Mr Simmons told the BBC. Since the debate and its fall-out, Ms Harris has altered her schedule to stick close to the president. She appeared at a heavily-scrutinised meeting last Wednesday where Mr Biden sought to reassure powerful Democratic governors about his fitness for office. And a day later, on the Fourth of July - America\u2019s Independence Day - she abandoned her usual tradition of grilling hotdogs for firefighters and Secret Service agents at her Los Angeles home to be by Mr Biden\u2019s side at the White House celebrations. The former top prosecutor has focused on criticising Trump in public appearances since the debate, pressing the case as to why voters should believe he is a threat to democracy and women\u2019s rights. At the same time, she has offered nothing but steadfast support for Mr Biden. Vice-presidents always need to strike a delicate balancing act between ambition and loyalty, but Ms Harris knows that this is not a moment where she can show any daylight between her and the president.\n\nGetty Images Her unpopularity as vice-president is a worry to Democrats assessing if Harris can actually beat Donald Trump\n\nKamala Harris is, however, far from the only alternative to Mr Biden being discussed. The list of potential Biden replacements ranges from a cadre of popular governors - Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Gavin Newsom of California, Pennsylvania\u2019s Josh Shapiro and Illinois\u2019 JB Pritzker - to Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and California congressman Ro Khanna. Ms Harris and her staff have refused to engage in public speculation. But her team is keenly aware of the behind-the-scenes conversations taking place as some party members coalesce behind her. A memo circulated online, purportedly written by Democratic operatives, laid out a detailed argument to promote Ms Harris despite her \u201creal political weaknesses\u201d. Trying to choose anyone other than her would throw the campaign into disarray and keep \"Democratic bickering\" in the media spotlight for months, it argues. If Mr Biden were to give up the nomination, the idea of the Democrats passing over Ms Harris in favour of another candidate appalls many on the left of the party and in its powerful black caucus. In that situation, \"this party should not in any way do anything to work around Ms Harris\", Mr Clyburn, one of the most prominent black lawmakers in Congress, told MSNBC last week. Republicans, too, have acknowledged Ms Harris would be the frontrunner to replace Mr Biden. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina warned on Sunday that Republicans must be ready for a \u201cdramatically different race\u201d should Ms Harris - whom he described as a \u201cvigorous\u201d candidate - become the nominee. Mr Graham emphasised her progressive California brand, suggesting she was closer in policy terms to left-wing firebrand Bernie Sanders than Joe Biden, in what appeared to be a glimpse of a Republican attack line should she become the candidate. For his part, Donald Trump has called her \u201cpathetic\u201d in the days since the debate. But ultimately the only question that matters for many Democrats - including deep-pocketed donors - is if she has a better chance of beating Trump than Joe Biden does. And that is deeply uncertain. Harris backers point to a recent CNN poll suggesting she would fare better than the president against Trump in November. In a head-to-head contest, Ms Harris trailed the Republican by only two points, while Mr Biden lagged six points behind him. The poll also suggested Ms Harris performed better than Mr Biden with independent voters and women. But many polling experts dismiss such hypothetical surveys, noting voter sentiment would change if Mr Biden actually decided to step aside and the Democrats entertained other potential candidates. One Democratic pollster close to the Biden campaign acknowledged that Ms Harris may have more potential to expand the party\u2019s voter base than the president, but was sceptical about how much of a difference she would make. Surveys pitting her against Trump at this stage \u201cdon\u2019t mean anything\u201d, said the person, who requested anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to the media.\n\nGetty Images Kamala Harris debated Trump's former VP Mike Pence during the 2020 presidential election after Joe Biden made her his running mate\n\nMs Harris, the child of an Indian mother and Jamaican father, performs better in surveys than Mr Biden with black, Latino and young voters - critical constituencies that allies say she could energise as the nominee. But whether she would actually boost turnout among younger voters of colour is another uncertain question. \u201cThis is just a wait and see moment,\u201d the pollster said. Some in the party are also asking whether Ms Harris\u2019 progressive reputation risks losing the union and blue-collar voters in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin that Mr Biden narrowly won in 2020 and which both parties need to secure a win in November. Should she take over the ticket, some Democrats have suggested that Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania or Governor Roy Cooper of North Carolina could be picked as running mate to capture centrist voters in Midwestern states. Given the ages of Joe Biden and Donald Trump, voters are paying far more attention to the VP candidate of both parties in this election cycle, said Celinda Lake, a veteran Democratic pollster who worked for the 2020 Biden campaign. On the Republican side, Trump has yet to announce his running mate, although many speculate he\u2019ll pick North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum or Ohio Senator JD Vance. Deep concerns among some Democrats about Harris's strength as a presidential candidate date back to her unsuccesful 2020 bid for the party's nomination, in which she landed blows on Mr Biden in an early debate but then crashed out before the first caucuses in Iowa. Critics said she struggled to define herself as a candidate, a sentiment that has lingered throughout her tenure as vice-president. She had a shaky start in the White House, marked by high-profile interview slip-ups, low approval ratings and staff turnover. She was also tasked with overseeing the administration\u2019s strategy to reduce migration over the US southern border, which increased to record levels over the last three years and remains a major vulnerability for the campaign. Those early stumbles led Ms Harris to be more cautious about her public appearances but many voters perceive her as ineffective and absent. \u201cPeople need to know more about her, what economic issues she is strong on and they need to be reminded of the role she\u2019s played,\u201d Ms Lake said. Over the last year, Ms Harris has found stable footing as the administration\u2019s leading voice on abortion rights, an issue that proved successful for Democrats during the 2022 midterm elections and one the party hopes will win back more voters in November. As a former prosecutor who handled sexual violence cases, she has invoked personal stories of working with women who miscarried in the bathroom or were turned away at hospitals as she\u2019s tried to mobilise voters around the issue. On the campaign trail, she has also sought to capitalise on other issues that resonate with young voters, including student debt forgiveness, climate change and gun violence. The White House, too, has made a concerted effort to promote her more forcefully. Still, she faces an uphill battle to change longstanding voter scepticism - her approval ratings hover around 37% in polling averages compiled by FiveThirtyEight - a level similar to both Mr Biden and Trump. And unless Mr Biden himself caves to the mounting party pressure to step down, grassroots Democratic supporters themselves seem resigned to supporting the current ticket.\n\nAt the Essence festival in New Orleans, Iam Christian Tucker, a 41-year-old small business owner from New Orleans, said she didn\u2019t care, ultimately, who the nominee was. She said she liked Kamala Harris, but she wasn\u2019t sure if a black female president could win election. \u201cI\u2019m voting against Donald Trump more than anything,\u201d she told the BBC. Greg Hovel, 67, who attended a rally for President Biden in Madison, Wisconsin, last week, said he supported Ms Harris in the 2020 primary and \u201chas always been a fan,\u201d though he cautioned there is \u201ca lot of anti-woman sentiment in this country.\u201d \u201cI think she would make an excellent president,\u201d Mr Hovel said. \u201cBut I still think Biden can win.\u201d Mike Wendling contributed to this report from Madison, Wisconsin.

        "text": "Read Biden\u2019s full letter to congressional Democrats declining to leave the 2024 presidential race\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden, in a letter to congressional Democrats, stood firm against calls for him to drop his candidacy and called for an \u201cend\u201d to the intraparty drama that has torn apart Democrats since his dismal public debate performance.\n\nRead the full letter by clicking the document below.\n\nBiden\u2019s efforts to shore up a deeply anxious Democratic Party came Monday as lawmakers are returning to Washington and confronting a choice: decide whether to work to revive his campaign or edge out the party leader, a make-or-break time for his reelection and their own political futures.\n\nBiden wrote in the two-page letter that \u201cthe question of how to move forward has been well-aired for over a week now. And it\u2019s time for it to end.\u201d He stressed that the party has \u201cone job,\u201d which is to defeat presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in November.\n\n\u201cWe have 42 days to the Democratic Convention and 119 days to the general election,\u201d Biden said in the letter, distributed by his reelection campaign. \u201cAny weakening of resolve or lack of clarity about the task ahead only helps Trump and hurts us. It\u2019s time to come together, move forward as a unified party, and defeat Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Biden hits campaign trail in battleground Pennsylvania amid growing calls to step aside\n\nAnxiety is running high as top-ranking Democratic lawmakers are joining calls for Biden to step aside despite his defiance. At the same time, some of the president\u2019s most staunch supporters are redoubling the fight for Biden\u2019s presidency, insisting there\u2019s no one better to beat Trump in what many see as among the most important elections of a lifetime.\n\nAs lawmakers weigh whether Biden should stay or go, there appear to be no easy answers.\n\nIt\u2019s a tenuous and highly volatile juncture for the president\u2019s party. Democrats who have worked alongside Biden for years \u2014 if not decades \u2014 and cherished his life\u2019s work on policy priorities are now entertaining uncomfortable questions about his political future. And it\u2019s unfolding as Biden hosts world leaders for the NATO summit this week in Washington.\n\nTime is not on their side, almost a month from the Democratic National Convention and just a week before Republicans gather in Milwaukee to renominate Trump as their presidential pick. Many Democrats are arguing the attention needs to be focused instead on the former president\u2019s felony conviction in the hush money case and pending federal charges in his effort to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nIt\u2019s what Biden himself might call an inflection point. As he defiantly says he will only step aside if the Lord almighty comes and tells him to, Democrats in the House and Senate are deciding how hard they want to fight the president to change course, or if they want to change course at all.\n\nIn an effort to \u201cget on the same page,\u201d House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries is convening lawmakers for private meetings before he shows his own preference, according to a person familiar with the situation and granted anonymity to discuss it. He plans to gather Democrats on Monday whose bids for reelection are most vulnerable.\n\nBut a private call Sunday of some 15 top House committee members exposed the deepening divide as at least four more Democrats \u2014 Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York, Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, Rep. Adam Smith of Washington state and Rep. Mark Takano of California \u2014 privately said Biden should step aside.\n\nNadler, as the most senior ranking member on the call, was the first person to speak up and say that Biden should step aside, according to a person familiar with the call who was granted anonymity to discuss it. He did so aware of his seniority and that it would allow others to join him.\n\nMany others on the call raised concerns about Biden\u2019s capability and chance of winning reelection, even if they stopped short of saying Biden should step out of the race.\n\nStill other members, including Rep. Maxine Waters of California and Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia, both leaders in the Congressional Black Caucus, spoke forcefully in support of Biden, as did Rep. Richard Neal of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the powerful Ways and Means Committee.\n\nAnd several lawmakers appeared frustrated that leadership was not providing direction or a path forward, according to people familiar with the call. One Democratic lawmaker said regardless of the decision, the situation has to \u201cend now,\u201d one of the people said.\n\nNeal said afterward that the bottom line is Biden beat Trump in 2020 and \u201che\u2019ll do it again in November.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Republicans ramp up attacks on Harris as talk of replacing Biden on 2024 ticket intensifies\n\nThe upheaval also is testing a new generation of leaders, headed by Jeffries and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. Both New Yorkers have refrained from publicly directing lawmakers on a path forward as they balance diverse opinions in their ranks.\n\nBehind the scenes is Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, who continues to field calls from lawmakers seeking advice about the situation, and is widely viewed as the one to watch for any ultimate decision on Biden\u2019s future because of her proximity to the president and vote-counting skills in party politics.\n\nPelosi spoke up last week, saying Biden\u2019s debate performance raised \u201clegitimate\u201d questions he needed to answer, but she has remained supportive of the president. And Biden called her last week when he reached out to other party leaders.\n\nWhen Biden\u2019s prime-time ABC interview on Friday appeared to do little to calm worried Democrats, and some said made the situation worse, Pelosi stepped forward to publicly praise Biden on social media as a \u201cgreat President who continues to deliver for America\u2019s kitchen table.\u201d She added, \u201cand we\u2019re not done yet!\u201d\n\nSchumer has kept a lower profile throughout the ordeal but will convene Democratic senators Tuesday for their weekly lunch when senators are certain to air many views.\n\nOne Democrat, Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, had intended to gather senators Monday to discuss Biden privately, but a person familiar with his thinking said those conversations will take place in Tuesday\u2019s regular caucus luncheon with all Democratic senators.\n\nAnother Democrat, Sen. Alex Padilla of California, said it was \u201ctime to quit the hand-wringing and get back to door knocking.\u201d\n\nPadilla spoke with Biden over the weekend, and urged his campaign to \u201clet Joe be Joe.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven the debate, I think the campaign has no choice,\u201d Padilla said Sunday, explaining that Biden needs to hold town halls and unscripted events to show voters \u201cthe Joe Biden I know, and that most people in American have come to grow and love.\u201d\n\nWATCH: \u2018Look at the numbers\u2019: Democratic Rep. Doggett calls for Biden to drop out of race\n\nWhile some deep-pocketed donors may be showing discomfort, strategists working on House and Senate races said they posted record fundraising as donors view congressional Democrats as a \u201cfirewall\u201d and last line of defense against Trump.\n\nHouse Democrats have had some of their better fundraising days yet, including a $3 million haul last Friday night after the debate at an event with former President Barack Obama and Jeffries in New York City. That\u2019s on top of $1.3 million that rolled into the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee during the debate and its immediate aftermath.\n\nSenate Democrats are also seeing a \u201csurge\u201d of support, according to a national Democrat with knowledge of Senate races.\n\nAs Democratic candidates campaign alongside Biden, the advice has been to focus on building their own brands and amplifying the way the work that\u2019s done in Congress affects their local districts.\n\n\u2014 Lisa Mascaro, Associated Press\n\nAssociated Press writers Farnoush Amiri, Kevin Freking, Seung Min Kim and Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.",

She tops the list of the probables if Biden pulls out of the race for the White House. This question was being asked because though she is campaigning for the Democrats, she mentioned Joe Biden's name only once in her about half an hour interview with 'Essence Fest'. The black women\u2019s magazine held the event on Saturday in New Orleans. Kamala Harris has hit the headlines and many fellow Democrats have put pressure on Biden to withdraw and allow the vice president to challenge Republican contender Donald Trump since his reportedly pathetic performance on the June 27 presidential debate.Kamala Harris explained Joe Biden administration\u2019s achievements and slammed the former president, but mentioned the president by his name only once in passing. She emphasized the achievement of the Democratic Party . She told the gathering, \"In 122 days, we each have the power to decide what kind of country we want to live in.\u201dKamala Harris' behavior starkly contrasted with the Congressional Black Caucus members who repeatedly defended the president by his name. Black leaders gathered in New Orleans made it clear that Joe Biden should continue his fight, but if eventually he withdraws, Kamala Harris should be elevated rather than considering governors like Gavin Newsom of California or Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan. Both of them are white.According to AP, Black Democratic consultant Antjuan Seawright pointed out that the pressure on Biden to pull out is coming from white Democrats or non-white minorities other than Black Democrats . Rep. Joyce Beatty, D-Ohio said that the US got a Black vice president so it should not be twisted. He emphasized that he would for the Biden-Harris team because the blacks would have someone in the White House fighting for them and making a difference.In an event organized by the black women\u2019s magazine 'Essence Fest' on Saturday in New Orleans, Kamala Harris talked for about half an hour, but she mentioned Joe Biden by his name only once. She kept on explaining the work done by the Democrat president.Black Democrat leaders gathered in New Orleans emphasized that Joe Biden should continue his fight, but if eventually he withdraws, Kamala Harris should be elevated rather than considering governors like Gavin Newsom of California or Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan.",

        "text": "Could Kamala Harris defeat Donald Trump in the US presidential election?\nWhat has sparked the discussion about Biden stepping aside for Harris?\n\nWhy do some believe Kamala Harris could be a strong candidate?\n\nHow does Harris perform against Trump in recent polls?\n\nWhat challenges might Harris face if she were the nominee?\n\nWhat do Harris's supporters say about her capabilities in a debate against Trump?\n\nWhat is the overall sentiment among Democrats about Harris replacing Biden?\n\nAs President Joe Biden continues his campaign for reelection, there are growing concerns within the Democratic Party about his viability as a candidate due to his age and performance during the first debate against Donald Trump . Some Democratic leaders and supporters have suggested that Vice President Kamala Harris might be a better option to face off against Trump in the 2024 election.This has led to a debate about whether Harris could defeat Trump if Biden were to step aside.Here is all you need to know about prospects and chances of Harris if she contests against Trump:The discussion gained momentum after President Biden faced intensified scrutiny regarding his fitness for another term. During a recent campaign trip in Pennsylvania, Biden urged unity among his supporters, but some leading congressional Democrats privately suggested it might be time for him to abandon his reelection bid. As the party remains divided, with some Democrats advocating for Biden to stay and others urging him to step aside, the possibility of Harris stepping in as the candidate has become a significant topic of conversation.Supporters of Harris argue that she has the potential to energize key Democratic-leaning groups, including Black voters , young voters, and those dissatisfied with Biden's handling of certain issues. Harris has also become a prominent voice on reproductive rights following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v Wade. Former Democratic Congressman Tim Ryan stated, \"She would energize the Black, brown, and Asian Pacific members of our coalition...she would immediately pull the dispirited youth of our country back into the fold.\"Recent polls suggest that Harris could fare better against Trump than Biden. A CNN poll found that while Trump leads Biden by six percentage points (49% to 43%), Harris trails Trump by a narrower margin (47% to 45%), within the margin of error. Another Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Harris and Trump nearly tied, with 42% supporting Harris and 43% backing Trump. Harris also showed strength among independents and moderate voters in these polls.Harris's tenure as Vice President has had its ups and downs, with early challenges and criticisms, particularly regarding her handling of immigration and voting rights issues. Some Democratic donors worry about her association with the far-left wing of the party, which they believe could alienate moderate and independent voters. Dmitri Mehlhorn, a fundraiser and adviser, said, \"Her greatest weakness is that her public brand has been associated with the far left wing of the Democratic Party ... and the left wing of the Democratic party cannot win a national election.\"Supporters believe Harris's prosecutorial background could be a significant advantage in a head-to-head debate with Trump. Dmitri Mehlhorn commented, \"She is incredibly focused and forceful and smart, and if she prosecutes the case against the criminality of Donald Trump, she will rip him apart.\"While there is no consensus, influential Democrats like House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Rep Jim Clyburn have indicated that Harris could be the best option if Biden steps aside. Civil rights leader Rev. Al Sharpton emphasized Harris's loyalty and the potential consequences of bypassing her, stating, \u201cShe\u2019s a loyal Democrat. I think the question is whether the Democratic Party will be loyal to women and loyal to Blacks, who have been loyal to them as symbolized by her.\u201d",

        "text": "Biden gets support from key lawmakers as he tells Democrats he won\u2019t step aside after debate\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden stood firm Monday against calls for him to drop his reelection candidacy and called for an end to the intraparty drama that has torn apart Democrats since his dismal debate performance last month, as key lawmakers expressed support for him to remain in the 2024 presidential race.\n\nAs anxious congressional Democrats returned to Washington weighing whether to work to revive his campaign or to try to edge him out, Biden sent them an open letter aiming to silence their skepticism of his fitness to lead the country for another four years. He insisted he wasn\u2019t leaving the race and stressed that the party has \u201cone job,\u201d which is to defeat presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in November.\n\nAfter a week of false starts, a coordinated effort by Biden and his campaign to shore up Democratic support appeared to be paying off, though he had by no means silenced his doubters. By late Monday, a sudden rush of public support from Democrats emerged \u2014 or at least some tempering of criticism \u2014 as Biden allies appeared to be trying to overpower the public and private voices calling on him to step aside.\n\nBiden wrote in the two-page letter that \u201cthe question of how to move forward has been well-aired for over a week now. And it\u2019s time for it to end.\u201d\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\n\u201cWe have 42 days to the Democratic Convention and 119 days to the general election,\u201d Biden said in the letter, distributed by his reelection campaign. \u201cAny weakening of resolve or lack of clarity about the task ahead only helps Trump and hurts us. It\u2019s time to come together, move forward as a unified party, and defeat Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nBiden followed up the letter with a phone interview with MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d show, in which he insisted that \u201caverage Democrats\u201d want him to stay in the race and said he was frustrated by the calls from party officials for him to step aside.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re big names, but I don\u2019t care what those big names think,\u201d Biden said.\n\nHe threw the gauntlet at his critics, saying if they\u2019re serious they ought to \u201cannounce for president, challenge me at the convention\u201d or rally behind him against Trump. Later, Biden joined a call with members of his national finance committee, while first lady Jill Biden campaigned for her husband in a three-state swing focused on engaging veterans and military families.\n\n\u201cFor all the talk out there about this race, Joe has made it clear that he\u2019s all in,\u201d she told a military crowd in Wilmington, North Carolina. \u201cThat\u2019s the decision that he\u2019s made, and just as he has always supported my career, I am all in, too.\u201d\n\nDemocratic voters are split on whether Biden should remain the Democratic Party\u2019s nominee for president, or whether there should be a different Democratic nominee, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, more prominent voices lined up behind Biden, including the chair of the House\u2019s Congressional Progressive Caucus, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, who was not ready to cast aside the president, saying that the threat of a second Trump presidency remains too high. Yet one of the most endangered Democrats this election cycle, Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, said in a statement, \u201cPresident Biden has got to prove to the American people \u2014 including me \u2014 that he\u2019s up to the job for another four years.\u201d\n\nHowever, Biden\u2019s letter left some House Democrats, who want to hear directly from Biden himself, furious, according to one House aide granted anonymity to discuss the situation. Lawmakers particularly bristled at being cast as out of touch with voters since representatives in particular have been home in their districts listening to voters.\n\nBiden met virtually Monday with the Congressional Black Caucus \u2014 one of his staunchest blocs of supporters in Congress \u2014 for 30 minutes. He told the group about his policy proposals for a second term, expressed gratitude to members for their support and repeatedly criticized Trump, according to a person familiar with the call and granted anonymity.\n\nWhile not every member of the Black caucus spoke up, no one spoke out against the president, the person said.\n\nBiden is also expected to meet this week with members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said Jayapal.\n\nMeanwhile, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden had undergone three neurological exams while in the White House as part of his annual physical exams \u2014 and no more \u2014 and said the president has not been diagnosed with or treated for Parkinson\u2019s.\n\nThe drama is playing out with just over a month until the Democratic National Convention and just a week before Republicans gather in Milwaukee to renominate Trump as their presidential pick.\n\nRep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., part of a newer generation of progressive lawmakers, said she backed Biden and expressed worry that Democrats were taking their eye off defeating Trump. \u201cWe\u2019re losing the plot here,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother prominent voice in the Congressional Black Caucus, Rep. Maxine Waters of California, said those opposing Biden \u201ccan speak for themselves or what they want to do, but I know what I\u2019m doing because I\u2019m a big Biden supporter.\u201d\n\nAnd Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee, said: \u201cI\u2019m tired of all this speculation. I just want to concentrate on the fact that we have to defeat Trump.\u201d\n\nTrump, for his part, predicted that Biden would remain in the race. \u201cIt looks to me like he may very well stay in,\u201d he told Fox News Channel\u2019s Sean Hannity on Monday. \u201cHe\u2019s got an ego and he doesn\u2019t want to quit. He doesn\u2019t want to do that.\u201d\n\nHouse Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, who has publicly stood by Biden even as he weighs how to address the concerns of many in his conference, said \u201csame answer\u201d Monday after an evening meeting the Capitol when asked if he supported Biden.\n\nAt the same time, other House Democrats almost ran from questions. Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., told reporters as she exited a leadership meeting that she was off to another meeting about the Great Lakes, and a group of House Democrats, including Reps. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia and Lauren Underwood of Illinois, changed the subject, declining to answer question as they ducked into an elevator.\n\nRep. Adam Smith of Washington, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, went public Monday with his call for Biden to step aside, saying it would be \u201ca mistake\u201d if Biden continues his campaign. \u201cI\u2019m calling on President Biden to step down,\u201d Smith said on social media.\n\nBiden\u2019s allies said they expected more direct engagement from the president with lawmakers \u2014 like the CBC virtual meeting \u2014 as he scrambles to shore up his candidacy. On a call Saturday with his campaign co-chairs, Biden repeatedly asked them who else needs to hear from him, who else he needs to engage with and who still has unanswered questions or concerns, according to Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del.\n\n\u201cHe is out there doing his job as a candidate and doing his job as president,\u201d Coons said.\n\nRep. Annie Kuster of New Hampshire, the chair of the New Democrat Coalition, has asked House leadership to invite Biden to speak to the entire Democratic caucus.\n\nIf the president\u2019s going to stay in the race, \u201cthen help us respond to questions from our constituents,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s so much easier to say, I was with him.\u201d\n\nRep. Nanette Barragan of California, the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, who supports Biden and campaigned recent with the first lady in Pennsylvania, said Biden \u201cshould talk to as many members as possible.\u201d\n\nSenators returning to Washington Monday were generally reluctant to criticize Biden, and many said they were waiting for the Democratic caucus meeting on Tuesday to hear concerns. It was still unclear if any Senate Democrats would publicly call for Biden to go, even as many have expressed deep concerns in private conversations over the last 10 days.\n\n\u201cHe ran an excellent campaign, and he\u2019s been an excellent president,\u201d said Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet. \u201cAnd I think what everybody is trying to satisfy is that\u2019s the same trajectory and path that we\u2019re on today.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer would not answer questions about Biden\u2019s reelection as he entered the Capitol on Monday, but he told reporters, \u201cAs I\u2019ve said before, I\u2019m for Joe.\u201d\n\nAnother Democrat, Sen. Alex Padilla of California, said it was \u201ctime to quit the hand-wringing and get back to door knocking.\u201d\n\nWhile some deep-pocketed donors may be showing discomfort, strategists working on House and Senate races said they have posted record fundraising as donors view congressional Democrats as a \u201cfirewall\u201d and last line of defense against Trump.\n\n__\n\nAssociated Press writers Farnoush Amiri, Kevin Freking, Darlene Superville, Jill Colvin and Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Project 2025: What It Is and What It Means for K-12 If Trump Wins\nProject 2025, a 900-page conservative policy agenda that proposes eliminating the U.S. Department of Education, has become a dominating force in the 2024 election campaign as President Joe Biden and Democrats use it to make their case against former President Donald Trump.\n\nBiden\u2019s team has referred to Project 2025 as a \u201cmanifesto infused with MAGA ideology\u201d that \u201cshould scare every single American\u201d and has mentioned it in dozens of recent news releases. Its creators frame it as an effort to bring \u201cself-government to the American people,\u201d according to the Washington Post. Meanwhile, the Trump campaign recently has tried to distance itself from the initiative.\n\nFor K-12 schools, the agenda proposes a complete restructure of governance at the federal level and the eventual elimination of a key federal funding source: Title I, which provides grants to schools with large populations of low-income students.\n\nThe central premise of the plan\u2019s education agenda is to scale back the federal government\u2019s role in education policy \u201cto that of a statistics-gathering agency that disseminates information to the states.\u201d\n\nThe Heritage Foundation, a conservative policy think tank, created the agenda as part of its Project 2025: Presidential Transition Project initiative.\n\nThe project has brought together former Trump administration officials and other allies of the former president, along with conservative advocacy organizations, to develop a playbook to start implementing on day one of a conservative presidential administration. It provides a detailed plan for virtually every corner of the federal government, and the initiative includes a database of potential staffers for a conservative administration.\n\nOf the policy agenda\u2019s 900 pages, 44 are dedicated to the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nThe agenda seeks to advance private school choice and parents\u2019 rights policies that have already become popular in many Republican-led states. But it would also change the entire fabric of federal education policymaking and how federal education laws are enforced by eliminating the Education Department and devolving the federal education functions that remain to other agencies.\n\nAside from eliminating the Education Department, here are some of the project\u2019s other proposals:\n\n\n\nPassing a federal parents\u2019 bill of rights similar to those passed in a number of Republican-led states, which the Project 2025 agenda says would give parents stronger standing in court \u201cwhen the federal government enforces any policy against parents in a way that undermines their right and responsibility to raise, educate, and care for their children\";\n\nTransitioning Title I to a \u201cno-strings-attached\u201d block grant administered by state education departments\u2014which could allow the funds to flow directly to parents in the form of education savings accounts to be used for private school and other educational expenses\u2014before phasing it out over the next decade;\n\nDistributing special education funds under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act to school districts as \u201cno-strings-attached\u201d block grants or directly into education savings accounts for parents to use on private school and other educational expenses;\n\nScaling back the federal government\u2019s ability to enforce civil rights laws like Title IX, which prohibits sex-based discrimination, and Title VI, which prohibits race-based discrimination by moving enforcement of those laws to the Justice Department and requiring that the federal government litigate potential violations in court, rather than through the more common route of negotiating settlements with school districts to change their practices;\n\nScrapping the Biden administration\u2019s Title IX revision , which would explicitly prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity;\n\n, which would explicitly prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity; Allowing states to opt out of federal education programs and devoting their share of federal education funds \u201ctoward any lawful education purpose under state law.\u201d The agenda asserts that federal education programs\u2019 \u201cregulatory burden far exceeds the federal government\u2019s less than 10 percent financing share of K\u201312 education.\u201d\n\nSee Also Open image caption Close image caption Former President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally, March 9, 2024, in Rome, Ga. Allies of the former president have assembled a detailed policy agenda for every corner of the federal government with the idea that it would be ready for a conservative president to use at the start of a new term next year. Mike Stewart/AP Federal What Would Happen to K-12 in a 2nd Trump Term? A Detailed Policy Agenda Offers Clues Remove Save to favorites\n\nSome of the proposals, including eliminating the Education Department, enacting a federal parents\u2019 bill of rights, and creating a universal federal school choice program, would require the approval of Congress, likely an uphill battle if Democrats control either the U.S. Senate or U.S. House of Representatives. But much of the agenda could be implemented through executive action.\n\nTrump, who is the presumed nominee for the Republican party, has said that Project 2025 does not reflect his policy agenda and has tried to distance himself from the proposal in recent weeks. In a post on his Truth Social platform on July 5, Trump said he has \u201cno idea who is behind it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI disagree with some of the things they\u2019re saying and some of the things they\u2019re saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal,\u201d Trump wrote.\n\nHowever, when it comes to education, Trump\u2019s actual policy proposals reflect much of what is written in Project 2025. On his website, Trump has promoted a potential federal parents\u2019 bill of rights, criticized the Biden administration for its Title IX revision, and proposed universal school choice programs.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t go so far as to suggest eliminating the Education Department, but he says he will \u201cfind and remove the radicals who have infiltrated\u201d the agency.",

        "text": "Tyler Perry on 2024 Election: \u201cWhat Is Important to Me Is That America Remains a Democracy\u201d\nTyler Perry weighed in on where his loyalties are in the 2024 presidential election on Monday evening.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you what\u2019s important to me, and I want you to hear me clearly when I say this,\u201d Perry told The Hollywood Reporter, when asked whether he was supporting Biden\u2019s re-election bid, at the New York premiere of Divorce in the Black on Monday evening. \u201cWhat is important to me is that America remains a democracy that is free from anyone that is trying to change that or is trying to have the power of a dictator or a king. So I\u2019m supporting anyone who stands against that.\u201d\n\nPerry supported Joe Biden and running mate Kamala Harris in the 2020 election. Now, his less specific comments come as some in Hollywood have pushed back against the president\u2019s bid for a second term. Influential entertainment industry figures such as Reed Hastings, Abigail Disney, Rob Reiner and more have called on Biden to drop out of the race (though Reiner seemed to walk back those comments in a post on X (formerly known as Twitter) on Monday). Many of those calling for Biden to drop out have cited the president\u2019s shaky performance at last month\u2019s debate as cause for concern, arguing Biden is too old to seek re-election.\n\nNevertheless, Perry\u2019s remarks echo the Democratic talking points that Trump said he\u2019d be a dictator on day one and that democracy is at stake in this election. His remarks also come after last week\u2019s Supreme Court opinion that gave former presidents immunity from prosecution for official acts, a decision that Biden and other Democrats have blasted as empowering the commander-in-chief to break the law.\n\nAlso at the premiere, held at the Regal Times Square movie theater, Perry spoke about his takeaways from making a film that goes behind the statistics about divorce.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I learned as much as I wanted to teach,\u201d the writer-director-producer said. \u201cLetting things go and not trying to hold onto \u2026 loving someone into a place that they are not able to go to is so important.\u201d\n\nDivorce in the Black, starring Meagan Good and Cory Hardrict, follows Good\u2019s Ava, a young bank professional whose husband (Hardrict) abandons a marriage she is determined to fight for, revealing his bad behavior that destroyed their relationship and her ability to love. It starts streaming on Amazon\u2019s Prime Video on Thursday.\n\nGood, accompanied by boyfriend Jonathan Majors, and Hardrict were also in attendance at the premiere along with co-stars Taylor Polidore, Richard Lawson, Debbi Morgan, Shannon Wallace and Joseph Lee Anderson.",

        "text": "Joe Biden drops out of presidential race: story of another US president who stepped aside\nAfter weeks of speculation, the incumbent US President Joe Biden announced Sunday (July 21) on X that he will withdraw from the US presidential elections. This announcement comes after weeks of speculation and after multiple calls by members of the Democratic Party to step aside, following a disastrous performance in the first televised presidential debate of the election season.\n\nThis move does have a precedent: he is not the first Democratic incumbent to have dropped out of the race just months before the presidential elections. On March 31, 1968, President Lyndon B Johnson announced he would not run for another term. This decision did not end well for the Democrats. Here is the story.\n\nWorn down by war\n\nThe story of Johnson\u2019s decision begins in the fields and jungles of Vietnam. Johnson inherited the war (and the White House) from his predecessor John F Kennedy, after the latter\u2019s assassination on November 22, 1963.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite his personal skepticism about the expansion of US involvement in the war, after assuming office, Johnson did not depart from the path set by his predecessor. By March 1965, he had sanctioned the landing of the first American combat troops in Vietnam, and an intense aerial bombing campaign.\n\nUS troop deployment in Vietnam continually went up under Johnson, from around 180,000 in 1965 to over 500,000 by 1968. More than 35,000 US troops were killed in action in this period.\n\nAs a highly organised, countrywide anti-war movement took shape, support for the war \u2014 and Johnson \u2014 plummetted. According to UC Santa Barbara\u2019s American Presidency Project, in March 1965, Johnson enjoyed an approval rating of 68-69%. By the end of 1966 this had fallen to 44%. At the same time, his disapproval rating had risen to 47% up from around 21% in March 1965. By the time Johnson left office in 1968, his approval rating was 36% and disapproval rating 52%.\n\nJohnson drops out\n\nAmidst growing popular disaffection, schisms began to emerge within the Democratic party. In 1967, Senator Eugene McCarthy decided to run against Johnson in the Democratic primary as an anti-war alternative to the President.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFew took Mccarthy\u2019s candidacy seriously until March 12, 1968, when the senator nearly pulled off an improbable upset in the New Hampshire primary. He won 42% of the vote compared to Johnson\u2019s 49%. Smelling blood in the water, Robert Kennedy, JFK\u2019s brother and also a war critic, decided to enter the race.\n\nThe primaries were now set to become a proper three-way fight, with Johnson under unprecedented pressure. People wanted change, and as the incumbent, Johnson represented the status quo. While he would likely have won the nomination anyway, he soon dropped out.\n\nOn March 30, Johnson ended a televised address, in which he announced a de-escalation in Vietnam hostilities (also unexpected), with a huge surprise.\n\n\u201cWith America\u2019s sons in the fields far away\u2026 I do not believe that I should devote an hour or a day of my time to any personal partisan causes\u2026 Accordingly, I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your President,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nDemocrats in disarray\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Richard Nixon cruised to the Republican nomination, the Democrats witnessed among the most hotly contested primaries in history. In the fray were three candidates \u2014 Kennedy, McCarthy, and Hubert Humphrey, Johnson\u2019s vice president and the the \u2018establishment candidate\u2019.\n\nBased on popular discontent with the war, either Kennedy or McCarthy should have been frontrunners. By August, when the Democratic National Convention was to be held in Chicago, McCarthy had secured almost 39% of the primary vote, whereas Kennedy had gotten above 30%. Humphrey had won a paltry 2.2% of the primary vote.\n\nAt the time, however, Democratic primaries were not all that democratic. Only 15 states chose their delegates via open primaries, with almost three-fifth of all delegates selected by party leaders in closed caucuses. Humphrey had secured the support of enough of these delegates to get him elected. Moreover, in June, after winning both the California and South Dakota primaries, Kennedy was shot dead, clearing the way for Humphrey to collect more delegates via backroom deals.\n\nThe Democratic convention was a catastrophe. Numerous organised groups had planned to disrupt proceedings, and over 20,000 police personnel were mobilised to keep things under check. The police roughed up McCarthy\u2019s delegates when they tried to stage a walkout. Outside the venue, it clashed with protestors throughout the days of the convention. Hundreds of injuries would be reported, including to innocent bystanders and press personnel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, the uninspiring and rather unpopular Humphrey became the Democratic presidential nominee. But with his party in disarray, he never stood a chance in the November election. Nixon comfortably defeated Humphrey, carrying 32 states, and 301 electoral votes compared to Humphrey\u2019s 191.\n\nHumphrey\u2019s nomination, despite lack of popular support, eventually led to a reform in the Democratic nomination process.",

        "text": "What the polls show 11 days after the Biden-Trump debate\nPresident Joe Biden was trailing former President Donald Trump \u2014 albeit within the margin of error \u2014 in many national and battleground polls before Biden\u2019s debate debacle.\n\nNow Biden is trailing by 1 to 2 points more in some surveys, but the movement is still within the margin of error, and few of the results reflect a radically altered race \u2014 though in our polarized and tightly divided politics, the campaign could very well hinge on such margins.\n\nThat\u2019s the polling takeaway 11 days after Biden\u2019s disastrous debate performance as a handful of Democrats have called for him to exit the race and a defiant Biden insists he\u2019s remaining in the campaign. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d he said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d\n\nAnd that minimal change in the polling mirrors what surveys found after Trump\u2019s criminal conviction in late May \u2014 slight movement of the sort that could matter a lot in a close presidential campaign but nothing suggesting a fundamentally changed race compared to what came before.\n\nTake the national polls. Before the debate, Trump was ahead of Biden by 1 point among likely voters in the CBS News/YouGov poll. Now his lead is 2 points \u2014 within the margin of error.\n\nIn CNN\u2019s national poll before the debate, in April, Trump was up by 6 points. After the debate? It was an identical 6 points.\n\nThe biggest movement came from the national New York Times/Siena College poll, but even that movement didn\u2019t suggest a sea change in the race over two weeks. Before the debate, according to that survey, Trump was ahead of Biden by 6 points among registered voters and 4 points among likely voters.\n\nAfter the debate, Trump\u2019s lead was 8 points among registered voters and 6 points among likely voters. That\u2019s a 2-point shift in Trump\u2019s direction.\n\nBattleground polls also show stability\n\nThen there\u2019s the battleground-state polling. Bloomberg News/Morning Consult polls released over the weekend found a mostly stable race, with Trump slightly ahead in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina and Pennsylvania and with Biden up in Michigan and Wisconsin. All of the results were within the margin of error, except Trump\u2019s 7-point lead in Pennsylvania.\n\n(That having been said, it\u2019s difficult to reconcile Biden\u2019s being down by 7 points in Pennsylvania but ahead by 5 points in that Bloomberg/Morning Consult polling.)\n\nThe exception to the stable polling was a Saint Anselm College poll of New Hampshire, which found Trump narrowly ahead, though well within the margin of error, in a multi-candidate field there. Remember, Democrats have won New Hampshire in every presidential election since 2000.\n\nWhile the topline results don\u2019t paint a picture of a fundamentally changed race, what has changed quickly in the polling since the debate are perceptions of Biden\u2019s health.\n\nThe CBS/YouGov poll finds the share of voters believing Biden has the mental and cognitive health to be president dropped from 35% in June to 27% after the debate \u2014 a larger change than what the CBS poll found in the horse race.\n\nImportant questions to ask\n\nNational Democrats are panicked after Biden\u2019s debate performance and its aftermath \u2014 with good reason.\n\nBut the polling raises important questions: Why weren\u2019t they panicked before the debate, when the numbers were already showing Biden facing a difficult road to re-election? Are national Democrats and progressive media voices simply catching up to where many voters had previously been about his age and health?\n\nAre most voters locked into their perceptions of both Biden and Trump, which explains why seismic events \u2014 like Trump\u2019s conviction or Biden\u2019s debate performance \u2014 have barely budged the poll numbers?\n\nAnd is it possible that another seismic event could shift the race a few points in the other direction for the voters who aren\u2019t locked in?\n\nAfter all, at least four events so far have slightly moved numbers in this stable race over the past year \u2014 the Israel-Hamas war, the aftermath of Biden\u2019s State of the Union address, Trump\u2019s conviction and the June 27 debate.\n\nWill there be another? You can probably count on it.",

        "text": "Doris Kearns Goodwin on what history may tell Joe Biden\nBy now, you know where things stand: President Biden says he's all-in. And no one \u2013 well, almost no one \u2013 can convince him otherwise. Asked by George Stephanopoulos of ABC News last Friday whether, if he were convinced he could not defeat Donald Trump, he would stand down, Mr. Biden replied, \"Well, it depends \u2013 if the Lord Almighty comes out and tells me that, I might do that!\"\n\nOn Friday he told a cheering crowd in Madison, Wisconsin, \"Let me say this as clearly as I can: I'm staying in the race.\"\n\nPresident Biden's decision comes as some Democrats are urging the 81-year-old to get out following last month's debate.\n\nBut beyond the headlines of hand-wringing in Washington, this moment also has the whiff of history. Two past presidents offer Mr. Biden a playbook of sorts of how to handle tough questions about age, stamina, and politics in a reelection campaign. \"I think history gives us two ways of thinking about this extraordinary moment,\" said Doris Kearns Goodwin.\n\nIn 1944, she notes, Franklin D. Roosevelt, facing concerns about his health, was determined to stay in the race for a fourth term as World War II raged. \"He decided that he had to stay in the race for the good of the country, because he felt that in a certain sense that he was like a soldier who could not give up his post if the country decided they wanted him to run,\" Goodwin said.\n\nFDR made an effort to show the country he had energy, though it wasn't always easy. \"He looked much older than he actually was,\" Goodwin said. \"He was only 62 years old. The presidency ages everybody. But he knew what he was facing, and he made the decision that somehow, even with that ill health, that he was the one who was best-equipped, and he barrelled through. So, he made a decision that he was going to go out among the people.\"\n\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt wave to the crowd as they wind up their Presidential campaign tour in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., November 6, 1944. FDR was elected to a fourth term as president. Charles Hoff/NY Daily News Archive via Getty Images\n\nThen in 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson made the decision to withdraw as pressure mounted, announcing on March 31, after the New Hampshire primary, that he would not seek nor accept his party's nomination for president. \"He decided, for the good of the country, that he was in such difficulty, that he wanted to bring peace in Vietnam. Thunderstruck was the country by that decision,\" Goodwin said. \"But it was for the good of the country, he believed, and there was an extraordinary reaction to it. He said he was happier than he'd been in his entire presidency.\"\n\nAs with FDR and LBJ, Biden's challenge, she said, is showing the American people he's up to it, not just with a single interview, but by showing command of what is, perhaps, the hardest job in the world.\n\n\"President Biden has a right to be proud of, is that he has a character that has humility,\" Goodwin said. \"He's had resilience. He has empathy toward other people, toward parts of the country, toward people in trouble, and he's had accountability and responsibility. So, I think, keeping that idea that what he wants most of all is for that character to be remaining and be part of his legacy will factor into how he decides this thing. Only he can really decide that. It's a really hard decision he's going to have to make in these days and weeks ahead.\"\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nStory produced by Jon Carras.

        "text": "Historian who predicted 9 of the last 10 elections says Dems shouldn't rebel against Biden\nAllan Lichtman, a historian who has correctly predicted the results of nine of the 10 most recent presidential elections, said Sunday that if Democratic delegates rebel against President Joe Biden and choose another Democratic nominee, it could spell chaos for the party.\n\nThere's no indication that Democratic delegates in large numbers would opt for another candidate to lead the party in November's election. But \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d host Shannon Bream asked Lichtman what obligations Democratic delegates have \u201cif President Biden says he\u2019s not going to leave the ticket.\u201d\n\nBiden overwhelmingly won Democratic primaries in all 50 states this year, racking up thousands of delegates ahead of the party's convention next month.\n\n\u201cDelegates could, in fact, decide to replace President Biden, but based on history, that would be a disaster to have a convention brawl,\u201d Lichtman, a professor at American University, argued on Sunday.\n\nBut the historian\u2019s comments come as some Democrats have called on Biden to drop out of 2024 race after his rocky debate performance against former President Donald Trump last month.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nLichtman has correctly predicted the outcome of almost every election over the last half century, except for the race in 2000, using a series of 13 historical factors or \u201ckeys.\u201d\n\nThe system includes four factors based on politics, seven on performance, and two on candidate personality. Lichtman said the incumbent party would need to lose six of those actors, or \u201ckeys,\u201d to lose the White House.\n\nThe keys range from whether a candidate is an incumbent president to the state of the economy and the presence of third-party hopefuls.\n\nDebate performance, however, is not one of the factors that determines the outcome of an election, Lichtman has previously argued. The professor said Sunday that Biden has already ticked two of the 13 keys, giving him an advantage over potential Democratic challengers. Those include already being an incumbent president and there being no \u201cparty contest\u201d this year for Democrats.\n\nLichtman warned that Democrats could risk \u201csetting up the same situation that led to the election of Donald Trump in the first place in 2016, an open seat with no incumbent running and a party contest.\u201d\n\nBiden has vowed that he\u2019s staying in the 2024 race, and only a handful of Democratic lawmakers have publicly called on him to pass the torch.\n\nContributing: Karissa Waddick, USA TODAY",

        "text": "What Is a Brokered Convention?\nEvery four years, Republicans and Democrats hold national conventions to choose their nominees for president of the United States. Since the 1970s, the process has played out in predictable ways. Going into the summer convention season, there\u2019s usually a clear winner of state primaries and caucuses, making the official nomination process largely ceremonial.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t always the case. The history of U.S. presidential elections is filled with conventions that were anything but predictable. Before the mid-20th century, it often took multiple rounds of hotly contested voting for a party to pick its nominee. Those were known as \u201cbrokered\u201d conventions, because the winner was ultimately determined by backroom deals struck by political power brokers.\n\n\u201cBrokered conventions used to happen a lot,\u201d says Andrew Rudalevige, a professor of government at Bowdoin College. \u201cIn the pre-primary era, delegates weren\u2019t pledged to a candidate going into the convention. You\u2019d have the first ballot where everybody voted for their favorite candidate and then you\u2019d really get down to business. It was pretty common for there to be a lot of horse trading on the convention floor.\u201d\n\nPresidential Election Facts\n\nOrigins of National Party Conventions\n\nThe Founding Fathers were opposed to the formation of political parties, and there are no rules or instructions in the Constitution for how to choose or nominate candidates for president. Instead, political parties and national party conventions were created in response to the system laid out in the Constitution for electing the president\u2014the electoral college.\n\nArticle II, Section 1 explains that the president is chosen by electors from each state (equal to their total number of senators and representatives in Congress). To become president, a candidate must win a majority of all electoral votes. If no candidate wins more than 50 percent of the electoral vote, the decision goes to the House of Representatives.\n\nAmerica 101: What is the Electoral College?\n\nPolitical parties formed almost immediately after George Washington left office, but it was often the case that multiple members of the same party ran for president. By splitting the vote, none of them won a majority, sending the election to the House.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened in 1824, when four Democratic-Republicans ran for president, including John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay and Andrew Jackson. Jackson received the most electoral votes, but not enough to reach a majority. When the decision went to the House, Clay\u2014who was Speaker of the House\u2014convinced his allies to rally around Adams, denying Jackson the presidency.\n\nJackson was furious and won a rematch against Adams in 1828, but Jackson\u2019s policies proved so divisive that his enemies formed a new anti-Jackson political party called the National Republicans. It was the National Republicans who held the first major national political convention in 1831 and nominated Clay.\n\nPrior to this, presidential candidates were nominated through a series of party caucuses in state legislatures and Congress. With improved communication in the early 19th century, political news and information traveled faster. Party officials organized national conventions to rally nationwide support behind a single nominee for president.\n\nJackson\u2019s supporters punched back against Clay by organizing the first Democratic National Convention in 1832. The modern Republican party, which formed in opposition to the spread of slavery in the western territories, held its first national convention in 1856.\n\nConvention Delegates and How They're Chosen\n\nThe nomination process at national party conventions is similar to the electoral college. Each state is allocated a certain number of delegates. The candidate who receives a majority of votes out of all the delegates wins the party\u2019s nomination. In the 2024 election, Democrats need at least 1,968 delegates to secure the nomination. Republicans need at least 1,215 delegates to win their party\u2019s nomination.\n\nThe Democratic and Republican parties are free to make up their own rules when it comes to the process for choosing a presidential nominee. Over time, those rules have changed considerably, particularly when it comes to the allocation of delegates.\n\nBefore 1972, delegates to both the Democratic and Republican national conventions were free to pick whichever candidate they preferred. A lot of states held primaries and caucuses, but the results of those primary elections weren\u2019t \u201cbinding.\u201d Delegates to both party conventions didn\u2019t have to go with the presidential candidate who won their state\u2019s primary.\n\nThat changed after the disastrous 1968 Democratic National Convention, where anti-war demonstrators protested the nomination of Hubert Humphrey, the establishment candidate. Humphrey didn\u2019t participate in any state primaries, but he still won the nomination, which infuriated progressive voters.\n\n1968 Riots at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago\n\nAfter Humphrey lost badly to Richard Nixon, the Democratic National Committee changed its convention rules in 1972. Democratic delegates were now bound by the results of their state primary or caucus. Each Democratic candidate is now awarded a set number of delegates based on the percentage of the state primary vote that they won. The Republicans followed suit and changed their convention rules so that most of their delegates are also bound or \u201cpledged\u201d to state primary election results.\n\nWhat Causes a Brokered Convention?\n\nToday, since almost all convention delegates are tied to the winner of their state\u2019s primary, there isn\u2019t much mystery as to how delegates will vote at each party\u2019s national convention. If a candidate wins a majority of the primary vote, they are all but guaranteed to secure their party\u2019s nomination.\n\nIn the past, though, there was no such guarantee. Many national party conventions were deeply divided, and it required multiple rounds of voting\u2014and plenty of passionate debate and political horse trading\u2014before delegates settled on a nominee.\n\nOf the 60 national conventions (30 Democratic and 30 Republican) held between 1868 and 1984, 18 of them qualified as brokered conventions (10 Democratic and eight Republican), according to Pew Research. A brokered convention is any convention that requires more than one round of ballots to choose a nominee.\n\n\u201cYou have factions within the parties,\u201d says Rudalevige. \u201cThey were trading delegates for political favors and trying to build coalitions. It was not uncommon for voting to go into multiple ballots.\u201d\n\nThe record-holder was the 1924 Democratic National Convention, which dragged on for 16 days. Back then, Democrats required a two-thirds vote to secure the nomination, not just a simple majority. With the vote evenly split between two fierce political enemies, Democratic delegates voted a whopping 103 times before reaching a consensus. In the end, neither of the frontrunners won. The nomination went to an unknown \u201cdark horse\u201d candidate named John W. Davis.\n\nThe last brokered convention happened more than 70 years ago. Coming into the 1952 Democratic National Convention, Senator Estes Kefauver had won 12 state primaries and was the clear frontrunner. But party officials were angry that Kefauver\u2019s televised hearings about organized crime had implicated some prominent Democrats. So they threw their support behind write-in candidate Adlai Stevenson, who won the nomination after three rounds of ballots.\n\nWhen Delegates are 'Unbound'\n\nEven though it\u2019s been decades since a party nomination was even seriously contested\u2014Jimmy Carter and Edward Kennedy came close in 1980\u2014it\u2019s still possible to have a brokered convention. That\u2019s because the rules tying delegates to primaries are thrown out if voting goes beyond the first ballot.\n\nAt the Democratic National Convention, if no candidate wins a majority of the delegates in the first round of voting, all delegates are \u201cunbound,\u201d meaning they can now vote for anyone they want, just like the old days. According to DNC rules, \u201cEligible delegates may vote for the candidate of their choice whether or not the name of such candidate was placed in nomination.\u201d The only qualification is that the candidate is a registered Democrat.\n\nThere is one additional twist for Democrats: If ballots go into a second round, then so-called \u201cSuperdelegates\u201d are allowed to vote, too. Superdelegates include Democratic party officials, elected officeholders like members of Congress and governors, and even former presidents. Superdelegates were created to bring some order to the 1984 convention after the mess between Carter and Kennedy in 1980. Superdelegates used to vote in the first round of ballots, too, but that changed in 2016.\n\nThe Republican National Committee has the same rule for its national convention. Roughly 7 percent of Republican delegates are \u201cunpledged\u201d to begin with, but if voting goes to a second round, then all delegates are freed from loyalty to the results of their state primaries.\n\nRudalevige notes that even in the first round of ballots, it\u2019s not technically \u201cillegal\u201d for a delegate to vote against his or her \u201cpledged\u201d candidate, but it\u2019s probably political suicide.\n\n\u201cEverybody who goes to these party conventions is a pretty loyal party member,\u201d says Rudalevige. \u201cThey\u2019re active within the party. They want a future within the party. Going back on their word would be a pretty good way to ruin that future.\u201d",

        "text": "Trump's campaign still owes El Paso over $500K for 2019 rally, other cities also unpaid\nDonald Trump still owes several cities money from past campaign rallies, including El Paso.\n\nInformation compiled in 2019 from the shows that at least 12 cities were owed money, showing El Paso was owed the most.\n\nLaura Cruz-Acosta, communications director for the City of El Paso confirmed Trump has an outstanding balance of $569,204.63 which includes a one-time late fee of $98,787.58 for his February 2019 visit.\n\nIt was primarily for law enforcement purposes and safety and security the health and wellness of the community as much as the health and wellness of those who were visiting us,\u201d Cruz-Acosta said.\n\nCruz-Acosta said the city has continued to try and contact the Trump campaign for payment and has sought the help of lawyers.\n\n\u201cThe city council actually took action in order to hire the Law Offices of Snapper Carr. The purpose of that was to advocate on behalf of the city to be able to obtain the funding that is owed to the city,\u201d she said.\n\nKFOX14 asked if the lack of payment has affected city finances or if they\u2019ve had to make up that money.\n\n\u201cThe impact to the community is at this point really not something that is going to impact our day-to-day operations, but it is something that we continue to seek out,\u201d Cruz-Acosta said.\n\nKFOX14 also tried contacting the Trump campaign via its website and only received an automatic response.\n\n\n\nWe also reached out to the other 11 cities on the CPI named as still being owed money, these cities are:\n\n\n\nTucson, Arizona Mesa, Arizona Albuquerque, New Mexico Spokane, Washington Eau Claire, Wisconsin Billings, Montana Erie, Pennsylvania Lebanon, Ohio Green Bay, Wisconsin Burlington, Vermont Minneapolis, Minnesota\n\nTwo responded. The police chief in Billings told KFOX14 Trump owes the city $45,900 for his 2018 visit.\n\nCity officials in Green Bay sent an invoice showing he owes $9,380 for his 2016 rally but was in the city just this year in March and the city is still waiting for the more than $33,000 payment for that visit.\n\nKFOX14 asked Cruz-Acosta if any other political visitors have current outstanding balances in El Paso and she said no.\n\nAs far as what would happen if Trump planned a visit to El Paso for his current 2024 presidential campaign, Cruz-Acosta said the city doesn\u2019t think he will make a stop here.\n\n\u201cLikely I can't foresee the visitor coming,\" she said.\n\nFor further legal efforts to get the money collected, Cruz-Acosta said city council would have to make that decision and direct the city attorney.\n\nto receive the top interesting stories from in and around our community once daily to your inbox.\n\n",

He was introduced by his father as \u201cmy boy,\u201d and the presumptive nominee said his son is going to college.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a very special guy,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the first time he\u2019s done it. That\u2019s the first time. Right?\u201d\n\nSupporters cheered loudly and stood up trying to catch a glimpse of him as Trump asked him to stand up.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re pretty popular,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have you. Welcome to the scene, Barron.\u201d\n\nThe Republican party of Florida had announced Barron would be a delegate at the Republican National Convention next week. But two days later the office of former first lady Melania Trump said he would not be able to make it.\n\nIn this entry published July 9, 2024, the Associated Press erroneously quoted former president Donald Trump that his son had just started dating. Trump said that his son had just turned 18.",

In it, I shared my thoughts about this moment in our campaign. It\u2019s time to come together, move forward as a unified party, and defeat Donald Trump. pic.twitter.com/ABtAaJrr0n \u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) July 8, 2024\n\nIn an interview with MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe show later on Monday, Biden insisted that party elites, rather than \u201caverage Democrats\u201d, are driving calls for him to quit the race.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re big names, but I don\u2019t care what those big names think. They were wrong in 2020. They were wrong in 2022 about the red wave. They were wrong in 2024,\u201d Biden said.\n\n\u201cCome out with me and watch people react.\u201d\n\nAt a later media briefing, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre denied that Biden is being treated for Parkinson\u2019s disease following media reports that a specialist in the illness visited the White House at least eight times between August and March.\n\n\u201cHas the president been treated for Parkinson\u2019s? No. Is he being treated for Parkinson\u2019s? No, he\u2019s not. Is he taking medication for Parkinson\u2019s? No,\u201d Jean-Pierre said.\n\nJean-Pierre refused to answer questions about the purpose of the visits by Kevin Cannard, a doctor at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, citing privacy and security concerns.\n\nJean-Pierre, however, pointed to Biden\u2019s most recent doctor\u2019s letter, issued in February, which said \u201can extremely detailed neurologic exam\u201d found no signs consistent with a stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson\u2019s or ascending lateral sclerosis.\n\nPolitical commentators and Democratic legislators have raised concerns over Biden\u2019s ability to serve a second term in office after he delivered a disastrous performance in a debate against Trump on January 27.\n\nThe Democratic president appeared exhausted and lost his train of thought during the event, prompting questions about his health and viability as a candidate in November\u2019s election.\n\nAdam Smith, a Congressman in the state of Washington, on Monday became the sixth Democratic lawmaker to publicly call on Biden to step aside.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s performance in the debate was alarming to watch and the American people have made it clear they no longer see him as a credible candidate to serve four more years as president,\u201d Smith said in a statement.\n\n\u201cSince the debate, the president has not seriously addressed these concerns.\u201d\n\nUS media outlets have reported that more Democrats also have expressed concerns privately.\n\nBiden faces a tough election battle against Trump, with recent opinion polls showing the former Republican president in the lead in key swing states, including Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nOpinion polls have consistently shown that most voters believe that Biden is too old to serve a second term.\n\nWhile Biden has come under mounting pressure from within his own party, he has so far managed to keep most of the Democratic top brass publicly onside.\n\nProminent Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and influential progressive Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, on Monday reiterated their support for the president.\n\nReporting from the White House on Monday afternoon, Al Jazeera\u2019s Kimberly Halkett said Democratic Party leaders on Capitol Hill are in \u201clistening mode\u201d.\n\nThey will be meeting on Tuesday for a weekly policy luncheon, Halkett reported, and this week\u2019s talks will be geared towards figuring out the party\u2019s next steps.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re hearing is there\u2019s kind of an unofficial deadline,\u201d she said. \u201cJoe Biden has really until this Friday to prove to the Democratic Party that he can do this job.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic Party will formally announce its 2024 presidential candidate at the party\u2019s national convention in Chicago in August.\n\nRepublicans, for their part, are set to confirm Trump \u2013 who in May became the first ex-president ever convicted of a crime in US history \u2013 as their candidate at the party\u2019s convention next week.",

        "text": "U.S. Embassy in Switzerland and Liechtenstein\nU.S. Embassy Bern, Switzerland\n\nTo vote in the November 2024 election, U.S. citizens overseas need to have completed a Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) in 2024. Whether you are a first-time voter or have already received ballots and voted absentee in past elections, you must complete an FPCA each calendar year to ensure you can participate in elections as an overseas absentee voter.\n\nIf you would like to drop off your completed FPCA for delivery to the United States via diplomatic pouch or to learn more about overseas voting, the U.S. Embassy Bern is organizing the following event:\n\nEvent: Voting Assistance for U.S. Citizens\n\nLocation: U.S. Consular Agency Geneva, Rue Francois-Versonnex 7, 1207 Geneva\n\nDate: Thursday, July 18, 15:30 \u2013 16:30\n\nWho: All U.S. Citizens Eligible to Vote\n\nJoin us for a presentation on overseas voting, including registration instructions, and an opportunity to ask your voting questions directly to the Embassy\u2019s voting assistance team.\n\nPlease note that U.S. embassies are not polling places or registration offices, therefore you will not be able to vote or complete your registration at this event. Voting information is already available on the Absentee Voting Information for U.S. Citizens Abroad page of the Embassy\u2019s website.\n\nRegistration is required.\n\nIf you can\u2019t make it to this event, you can mail your ballot request FPCA or completed ballot placed into a second envelope to: U.S. Embassy Bern, CONS/ACS/Voting, P.O. Box, 3001 Bern, Switzerland for return to the United States. It must be addressed to your local election officials and have sufficient U.S. postage, or be in a postage-paid envelope. A postage-paid envelope is available on the FVAP website. Normal transit time for mail from Switzerland to the United States is 14 days.\n\nEven if you have never voted while overseas before, the process is easy:\n\nRequest your ballot. Complete a new Federal Post Card Application (FPCA). You must complete a new FPCA after January 1, 2024, to ensure you receive your ballot for the 2024 elections. Submitting the FPCA allows you to request absentee ballots for all elections for federal offices (President, U.S. Senate, and U.S. House of Representatives) including primaries and special elections during the calendar year in which it is submitted. All local election officials in all U.S. states and territories accept the FPCA.\n\nYou can complete the FPCA online at FVAP.gov. The online voting assistant will ask you questions specific to your state. We encourage you to request your blank ballots be delivered electronically (by email, internet download, or fax, depending on your state). Include your email address on your FPCA to take advantage of the electronic ballot delivery option. Return the FPCA per the instructions on the website. The online voting assistant will tell you if your state allows the FPCA to be returned electronically or if you must submit a paper copy with original ink signature. If you must return a paper version, please follow the same instructions below for returning your ballot.\n\nReceive and complete your ballot. States are required to send out ballots 45 days before a regular election for federal office and generally send ballots at least 30 days before primary elections. For most states, you can confirm your registration and ballot delivery online.\n\nReturn your completed ballot. While some states allow you to return your completed ballot electronically, others do not. If your state requires you to return paper voting forms or ballots to local election officials, you can do so free of charge at the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate. Place your ballot in a postage-paid return envelope, or in an envelope bearing sufficient domestic U.S. postage, and address it to the relevant local election officials.\n\nResearch candidates and issues. Please see the FVAP links page for resources you can use to research candidates and issues. FVAP regularly sends information about election dates and deadlines through their Voting Alerts. Email vote@fvap.gov to subscribe or follow FVAP on Facebook or Twitter.\n\nLearn more at the Federal Voting Assistance Program\u2019s (FVAP) website, FVAP.gov.

While many in the House of Representatives have openly voiced their concerns against Biden after the first presidential debate , those in the Senate have remained quiet till day. This may change soon. There are multiple reports indicating that various Senators belonging to the Democratic Party have gathered in Washington to discuss the political situation in the country. There are also growing number of Senators who are demanding answers from Biden and sought assurances on the way forward. This has been reported by The Hill.Senator Tina Smith said that there are many concerns and the way forward is definitely not going to be easy. Many of the Senators including Michael Bennet have said that the electors have sought answers pertaining to Biden\u2019s health and also are keen to know if the president intends to contest the upcoming election. He said that many were fine with one bad debate against Trump but were worried if there is a larger problem.Many other Senators are keen to have a frank discussion on this topic in the coming days and feel that time is running out ahead of the election in November. Senators Jon Tester and Sherrod Brown have said that Biden has to convince them of his capabilities to win the election and finish a second term in office.Meanwhile there are Senators including the Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Dick Durbin who have supported the president.Biden has been meeting many law makers and has been addressing their concerns pertaining to his health. He has stated that he does not intend to step down and will contest the upcoming election.There will be the Senate Democratic Conference on Tuesday when Democratic Party Senators will be meeting and holding frank discussions on this topic. Senator Mark Warner wanted to hold a meeting on Monday itself but cancelled it after a meeting on Tuesday was scheduled.At the time of the election, their support makes a difference among the voters. The voters look up to the advice provided by these Senators who enjoy the local support in their states.He has won the primaries convincingly and this makes it tough for his party to deny him a nomination. Further, the rules are clear and there could be a loophole which can be used to deny him a nomination.",

        "text": "How Donald Trump's Election Lies and Other Anti-Voter Policies Will Continue to Impact Our Democracy\nIf re-elected in November, he and his allies have promised to take actions that would disenfranchise millions, suppress the right to vote, and limit voting access.\n\nThis piece was published before Joe Biden withdrew from the 2024 presidential election and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to represent the Democratic Party. No significant facts have been changed or added. Donald Trump\u2019s claim that the 2020 election was \u201cstolen\u201d from him is not only a lie\u2014no widespread voter fraud was detected in that election\u2014it\u2019s a lie that breeds public mistrust in our electoral system. Today, he is already casting doubt on the 2024 election, saying he will accept the results \u201cif everything is honest.\u201d The implication is that if Trump loses then the election may not have been honest, and that a free and fair election this November is only one in which he wins. A second Trump administration will likely perpetuate policies that undermine our electoral systems. As outlined in Project 2025 policies, evidenced on the campaign trail and in interviews, if Trump is reelected, his administration will likely attempt to manipulate the 2030 census to deny representation and federal resources to millions; abuse executive power to suppress voting and interfere with elections; and roll back federal progress on voting access. In a country that has a long history of voter suppression and continues to struggle with voter turnout, four years of constant attacks on our voting rights risks long-term, pervasive harm. At the ACLU, we\u2019re fighting back. We defeated the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to manipulate our electoral process before, and we\u2019ll use every tool at our disposal to do so again. Learn more in our breakdown:\n\nTrump on Voting Rights\n\nThe Facts: During a second term, not only would Trump seek to intimidate and disenfranchise marginalized voters, he would lay the groundwork to further question election outcomes that are adverse to him and his allies. Trump is likely to deploy the Department of Justice (DOJ) and other federal agencies to launch bad-faith investigations into voters and election officials, including against those he believes \u201crigged\u201d the 2020 election. A second Trump administration is also likely to make good on earlier promises to send federal law enforcement to voting locations\u2014a move that would serve just one purpose: to suppress voter turnout by intimidating voters. Importantly, a second Trump administration would likely attempt to manipulate the 2030 census by adding a citizenship question. Census population counts impact apportionment of representatives, funding, and other resource allocation. Additionally, the Trump administration would also seek to reverse nonpartisan federal efforts to promote and expand access to voting, particularly for marginalized communities. That includes rescinding Executive Order 14019, which focuses on increasing language access, mitigating barriers for individuals with disabilities, and increasing voter education and registration opportunities under the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA). Why It Matters: A second Trump administration\u2019s efforts to undermine the right to vote will have consequences far beyond the 2024 election. Since the census is conducted every 10 years, manipulation of the census and apportionment will deny millions of voters equal representation and fair resource allocation for at least a decade. Trump\u2019s likely plan to add a citizenship question to exclude noncitizens from apportionment would result in significant undercounting of historically vulnerable or underrepresented populations, specifically Latine and Asian communities and those living in urban areas, which would have reverberating negative impacts on district maps and allocation of funding. Furthermore, Trump has stated that whether the upcoming election may be challenged is subject to the \u201cfairness of the election\u201d and whether he wins. This rhetoric yet again demonstrates a willingness to potentially abuse executive powers.\n\nTrump on Voting Rights A second Trump administration will make it harder for Americans to vote. The ACLU will use every tool at our disposal to fight back.\n\nSource: American Civil Liberties Union",

        "text": "Can Iran\u2019s New President Change the Regime\u2019s Confrontational Foreign Policy?\nThe election of Masoud Pezeshkian as the president of Iran creates an opportunity, albeit only a limited one, for Iran to move away from its absolutist anti-Western foreign policy. Pezeshkian, a cardiologist, former health minister, and member of the Iranian parliament, defeated the ultraconservative former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili in the July 5 runoff election to replace President Ebrahim Raisi following his fatal helicopter crash in late May. Amid an economic downturn and political disenchantment, Pezeshkian\u2019s win signals the Iranian public\u2019s desire for change. In addition to social and economic promises, Pezeshkian\u2019s campaign focused in part on a new foreign policy for Iran, prioritizing the removal of sanctions, which in turn means cutting a deal with the United States. Overtures from Iran\u2019s new president should not be rejected even though expectations should be limited given the president\u2019s continued subjugation to the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has long seen the United States as hostile to Iran and mostly favored a hardline stance.\n\nForeign Policy Continuity\n\nIran\u2019s system empowers the supreme leader, and this is especially true in foreign policy. The president\u2019s official powers are largely confined to domestic issues, with the supreme leader maintaining control over key foreign policy decisions. In addition, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) veterans occupy numerous defense, security, and foreign policy positions, pushing policy in an anti-U.S. and anti-Israel direction.\n\nThe April back-and-forth with Israel, the first time the two countries directly and openly attacked each other despite 35 years of enmity, suggests that the regime is more confrontational than in the past. However, under Raisi, Iran was also trying to ease its diplomatic isolation and improve ties with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states. This move, certainly blessed by the supreme leader, will probably continue under President-Elect Pezeshkian.\n\nThroughout his presidential campaign, Pezeshkian emphasized the importance of reviving the Iranian nuclear deal, in part to bolster Iran\u2019s flagging economy. However, Khamenei\u2019s comments from election week attempted to undercut Pezeshkian\u2019s calls for cooperation with the United States on nuclear issues. Offering a thinly veiled warning to Pezeshkian ahead of the first round of elections, Khamenei stated that anyone who believes \u201call ways to progress\u201d come from the United States should not be supported. Khamenei\u2019s rhetoric tempers expectations of renewed cooperation between Iran and the West, despite Pezeshkian\u2019s best efforts.\n\nOne important shift in Iran\u2019s foreign policy over recent years is its improved cooperation with Russia and China following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Iran has provided military support to Russia, and Russia and Iran have moved closer to each other politically and militarily. Tehran also joined a free trade agreement with the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union. Iran is likely counting on greater Russian, and perhaps Chinese, military and economic support as well as diplomatic backing in the future.\n\nImpact of Sanctions on Iran\n\nIran has been under a wide variety of sanctions due to its nuclear program, support for terrorism, and human rights record. Iran\u2019s leaders have long stressed autarky, and it is difficult to disentangle the impact of sanctions versus corruption and general economic mismanagement. When the Trump administration reimposed many sanctions in 2018, Iran\u2019s economy cratered, and its oil exports plummeted. The Biden administration has eased some sanctions, but Iran\u2019s economy suffers from high inflation (reaching 40 percent in February 2024), even though it has been able to restore most of its oil production. One of the bigger effects of sanctions is indirect: discouraging foreign direct investment in Iran.\n\nBecause of the pain of sanctions, removing them has been a priority of Iranian leaders. Khamenei\u2019s rhetoric is defiant, but he has allowed other officials to explore opportunities for sanctions relief. As Pezeshkian\u2019s election makes clear, the Iranian people also favor efforts to pursue the lifting of sanctions, blaming them for some of Iran\u2019s economic pain.\n\nAlthough sanctions have hurt Iran, there are trade-offs for the United States. Western sanctions have increased incentives for Iran to trade with and otherwise rely on Russia and China. In addition, former U.S. government official Vali Nasr has argued that sanctions have weakened the independent private sector and middle class and enabled the regime to reward its supporters with access to foreign currency and economic opportunities, thus increasing the regime\u2019s power vis-\u00e0-vis society.\n\nImpact of the U.S. Presidential Election\n\nThe 2024 U.S. presidential election may have a greater impact on Iran\u2019s foreign policy than Iran\u2019s own presidential election. If President Biden is reelected (or if another Democratic leader wins, should Biden step aside), the administration would be likely to pursue a nuclear deal with Iran and try to reduce Iran\u2019s destabilization efforts in the Middle East. Politically, however, the Biden administration has found it difficult to move forward with a renewal of the Iran nuclear agreement or other serious negotiations, as this would lead to criticism that the administration is rewarding Iran despite its support for terrorism. Biden might be more willing to expend political capital in a second term to make concessions to Iran, but in general this is unlikely given the overall difficulty of negotiations and his prioritization of Europe and especially Asia over the Middle East.\n\nPresident Trump and his advisers in the past favored a \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign that, as its name suggests, opposes negotiations and favors economic pressure in particular. Trump may also improve U.S.-Russia ties, which would in turn decrease Moscow\u2019s incentives to work with Tehran.\n\nTrump, however, may be less likely to provide military support to U.S. Arab allies against Iran. The Biden administration worked closely with Israel, Jordan, and Gulf states to shoot down Iranian drones and missiles when Iran attacked Israel in April 2024. In contrast, Iran attacked Saudi Arabian oil processing facilities in 2019, a target long considered a \u201cred line\u201d for multiple American administrations, and the Trump administration did nothing, infuriating Saudi leaders, who had previously been supportive of Trump. Overall, Trump in his first administration was more skeptical of the use of military force and of involvement in the Middle East outside of support for Israel.\n\nFurther restrictions on Iranian oil sales have complications for any U.S. administration. Successful restrictions would increase the overall price of oil at a time when the United States and other countries are sensitive to inflation. In addition, higher oil prices increase revenues for Russia, which is more of a priority under President Biden than is Iran.\n\nPezeshkian\u2019s election is a step in the right direction for Iran, and it is worth testing the waters to see if he is permitted to try to improve relations with the United States and its allies. The new president\u2019s power is limited, however, and uncertain U.S. politics also make any significant change in relations less likely.\n\nDaniel Byman is a senior fellow with the Warfare, Irregular Threats, and Terrorism Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, D.C.

The findings from each exam have been released to the public.\u201d\n\nJean-Pierre had been asked in Tuesday\u2019s White House press briefing whether neurologist Cannard\u2019s meeting with the president\u2019s physician, O\u2019Connor, on January 17 was \u201crelated to care for the president himself.\u201d (CNN previously confirmed via White House visitors\u2019 logs that the two men had met in January at the White House).\n\nJean-Pierre answered: \u201cI can say that it was not.\u201d\n\nThe reference in Jean-Pierre\u2019s new statement blaming the fact that a specific date had not been mentioned in the reporter\u2019s question does not pass muster. Cannard was listed on the White House visitors logs multiple times over the past year, but only once \u2013 in January \u2013 shown to have met with O\u2019Connor. The reason for that particular visit had been a focus of multiple questions in Monday\u2019s White House press briefing.\n\nJean-Pierre\u2019s correction reveals that Cannard had not only met with O\u2019Connor in relation to the president in January, but that he had examined the president during that visit as a part of his annual medical exam.\n\nThis is not the first time that Jean-Pierre\u2019s answers to questions related to the president\u2019s health since his disastrous debate performance last month have required clarification.\n\nBiden was examined by his physician in the days following last month\u2019s CNN presidential debate, the White House told CNN last week \u2014 despite having previously said that the president has had no medical exams since his February physical and had not been \u201cchecked out by the doctor\u201d for his cold around the debate.",

        "text": "Russia is starting to try to influence US presidential race, intelligence official says\nRussia has begun attempting to influence the outcome of the 2024 U.S. presidential election, a U.S. intelligence official said on Tuesday, with Moscow\u2019s preferred candidate seemingly being former President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to see Russia target specific voter demographics, promote divisive narratives and denigrate specific politicians,\u201d an official from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told reporters during a press call.\n\n\u201cWe have not observed a shift in Russia\u2019s preferences for the presidential race from past elections, given the role the U.S. is playing with regard to Ukraine and broader policy toward Russia,\u201d the official later added.\n\nThe clandestine community eventually concluded that the Kremlin\u2019s efforts to sway the 2016 and 2020 presidential races were undertaken to tilt the contest in favor of Trump.\n\nA second ODNI official told reporters \u201cwe have conducted outreach with the presidential campaigns and with the candidates.\u201d\n\nThe first ODNI official said Moscow is \u201dusing a variety of approaches to bolster its messaging and lend an air of authenticity to its efforts,\u201d including outsourcing work to commercial firms to conceal its involvement. Influence actors are also planning to covertly use social media to amplify narratives in American swing states to diminish U.S. support for Ukraine.\n\nIn one instance, officials observed a Russian influence organization try to appeal to U.S. audiences through encrypted direct messaging channels \u2014 though the official did not specify which ones.\n\nThe assessment comes the same day as two other election security-related efforts by the federal government.\n\nIn a statement, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said Iranian actors are penetrating pro-Gaza protests in the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe have observed actors tied to Iran\u2019s government posing as activists online, seeking to encourage protests, and even providing financial support to protesters,\u201d according to Haines, who was pressed on the issue when she testified before the Senate in May.\n\nAmericans being targeted by Tehran\u2019s campaign \u201cmay not be aware that they are interacting with or receiving support from a foreign government,\u201d she noted. \u201cWe urge all Americans to remain vigilant as they engage online with accounts and actors they do not personally know.\u201d\n\nIn addition, U.S. and international authorities seized a Russian artificial intelligence bot farm that spewed disinformation.\n\nSpeaking on the Tuesday call with the ODNI official, an FBI official described the action as \u201celection adjacent,\u201d noting one of the examples given by law enforcement was one of the bots commenting on a candidate\u2019s post. Rather, much of the activity was \u201cfocused on Ukraine discussions and trying to produce a favorable outcome with respect to that for the Russian government.\u201d\n\nThe ODNI official said Moscow\u2019s approach to U.S. elections has become \u201cmore sophisticated\u201d after the 2016 and 2020 cycles, including understanding that \u201ctargeting swing state voters is particularly valuable to them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat doesn't mean to say that they're perfect or fully successful,\u201d the official told reporters, adding the spy community doesn\u2019t track the actual effectiveness of foreign influence campaigns.\n\n\u201cIt's more to just say that they recognize the limitations of their own approach.\u201d\n\nThe other two in the \u2018Big Three\u2019\n\nWhile Russia has started making moves against Election Day, China likely does not plan to influence the presidential race \u201cfor now\u201d because \u201cit sees little gain in choosing between two parties that it perceives as both seeking to contain Beijing,\u201d the ODNI official said.\n\nStill, Chinese officials will follow whether either major political party changes its platform or makes a particular statement that China believes is \u201csignificant enough to risk the potential blowback that they may face if they were to influence or seek to influence the election.\u201d\n\nU.S. officials are also watching if China might seek to influence select down ballot races, as it did in the 2022 midterm elections, ranging from the federal and state level all the way, potentially, to local contests, the ODNI official said.\n\nIn addition, Beijing is looking to expand its ability to collect and monitor data on all major U.S social media platforms \u201cprobably to better understand and eventually manipulate public opinion.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the official labeled Iran a \u201cchaos agent\u201d \u2014 a moniker used by another intelligence official last month.\n\nThe clandestine community will provide additional election security updates heading into November, including the 100-day mark later this month, as well as at 60 and 30 days out from Election Day.\n\nSenate Intelligence Committee Chair Mark Warner (D-VA), who has been critical of the spy community\u2019s public outreach efforts on election security, praised today\u2019s briefing.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that these updates \u2013 in addition to efforts by civil society and the private sector \u2013 will serve to better inform and prepare the public,\u201d he said in a statement.",

        "text": "July 8, 2024, presidential debate and election news\nPresident Joe Biden called in to MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d Monday as he looks to turn the tide on mounting criticism from members of his own party and do more \u201coff-the-cuff,\u201d unscripted engagements to quell concerns about his age.\n\nA defiant Biden pledged he wasn\u2019t going anywhere and derided those Democrats calling for him to step down as part of the \u201celite.\u201d\n\nBiden offered a confusing response to a question about his letter to Hill Democrats calling for unity, lambasting former President Donald Trump for being on the golf course after the debate. Trump has largely stayed under the radar while Biden battles the news cycle.\n\n\u201cWell, look \u2013 Democrats \u2013 Joe, let me say it this way, the reason I\u2019ve been on the road so much, all over the country, while Trump is riding around in a golf cart, filling out his golf card before, golf card before he even hits the ball \u2013 but anyway, he hasn\u2019t been anywhere in 10 days, I\u2019ve been all over the country No. 1,\u201d he said.\n\nHe continued: \u201cAnd I\u2019ve gone over a country for several reasons. One, to make sure my instinct was right about the party still wanting me to be the nominee. And all the data, all the data shows that the average Democrat out there who voted, 14 million of them who\u2019ve voted for me, still want me to be the nominee, No. 1.\u201d\n\nThe president was also asked to respond to criticism of a response he gave to ABC News Friday to a question about how he\u2019d feel in January if Trump won.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll feel as long as I gave it my all and I did the good as job as I know I can do, that\u2019s what this is about,\u201d Biden said Friday.\n\nHe dismissed the growing concerns from those who have said it was not a satisfactory answer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an option and I\u2019ve not lost and I haven\u2019t lost. I beat him last time, I beat him this time. Look at his performance at debates,\u201d Biden said. \u201cHe\u2019s just a liar, and he hasn\u2019t done a damn thing since the debate.\u201d\n\nAsked how he would reassure voters that he wouldn\u2019t have another night like his performance in the presidential debate, he said, \u201cLook at my career,\u201d adding that he has \u201cnot had many of those nights.\u201d",

        "text": "Joe Biden commits to staying in the race \u2013 like Nixon, his biggest threat comes from within his own party\nPresident Joe Biden is strongly reaffirming his commitment to stay in the presidential race \u2013 despite a growing number of calls from politicians and voters for him to step down, following a highly criticized debate performance in June 2024.\n\nAfter Biden said in an ABC news interview that only \u201cthe Lord Almighty\u201d could convince him to drop out, he wrote a letter on July 8 to congressional Democrats declaring that \u201cI am firmly committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nThis comes as additional prominent Democratic politicians are reportedly \u2013 and mostly privately \u2013 calling for Biden to exit the race.\n\nBiden has been consistent in saying he\u2019s staying in the race, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily tell the whole story. The Conversation\u2019s Politics and Society Editor Amy Lieberman spoke with Philip Klinkner, a scholar of American politics and the presidency at Hamilton College, to better understand what factors might influence what Biden says and his ultimate decision to stay in the race or not.\n\nCan we take Biden\u2019s words about staying in the race at face value? Do they reflect what\u2019s happening behind the scenes?\n\nBiden obviously knows that his support among Democrats \u2013 mostly elected Democrats in Congress, governors and others \u2013 is slipping. He knows that if he shows signs of indecision, that could lead to less support from Democrat politicians, which would cause even more waffling. He is trying to present a brave front as a way to kind of stem any defections, doubts and bleeding. So far, that hasn\u2019t really had the intended effect.\n\nEach day we see a trickle of Democrats in Congress who have called for Biden to step aside. Biden\u2019s approach may have kept this trickle from becoming a deluge, but it could become a deluge at any time.\n\nWhat factors are these politicians considering as they decide whether to back Biden or not?\n\nThere is a range of considerations. One argument is that Biden is obviously flawed, but is there anyone out there who would be a better nominee against Trump? Another factor is that Biden has been a Washington, D.C. fixture for decades. Many of these people are friends with him and have worked with him. They don\u2019t necessarily want to be the friend who turns on him in the end.\n\nThe other factor is that if Biden is not going anywhere, these politicians don\u2019t want to be the one who calls for him to leave. Then, Biden and the folks who work around him could later say, \u201cYou abandoned me when I needed you most.\u201d\n\nHave we seen politicians previously who emphatically committed to staying in a race before they abruptly changed their minds?\n\nPoliticians are always fully committed to some course of action until they are not, and they often express this in the most absolute terms.\n\nIn 1972, Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern selected Thomas Eagleton as his vice president running mate. News then came out that Eagleton had been treated for depression and had electroconvulsive therapy. At the time, attitudes toward mental illness were not as accepting as they are today, and McGovern and Eagleton faced a lot of criticism. McGovern first said he was behind Eagleton \u201c1,000%,\u201d and then a few days later he cut him loose and dropped him from the ticket.\n\nUntil a day or two before Richard Nixon resigned as president in August 1974, he said he would never do it. For more than a year, people were calling on Nixon to resign following the Watergate scandal, in which Nixon operatives were caught trying to bug the Democratic National Committee headquarters. These calls amplified after the Saturday Night Massacre in October 1973, when he fired a special prosecutor and accepted the resignations of the two top officials in the Department of Justice \u2013 the attorney general and deputy attorney general \u2013 who were involved with investigating Watergate.\n\nWhat was the critical moment in these two cases?\n\nIn Nixon\u2019s case \u2013 and as Biden could be be facing now \u2013 the support of his own party collapsed. Top congressional Republicans went to the White House and said, \u201cLook, you will be impeached if you don\u2019t step down.\u201d Nixon famously asked Senator Barry Goldwater about what his support in the Senate looked like. Goldwater said, \u201cThere\u2019s not more than 15 senators for you.\u201d\n\nWith Eagleton and McGovern, the lack of support from within their party was also a key factor that led to the switch in vice presidential candidate.\n\nIn Biden\u2019s case, I think that having senior Democrats like Congressman Jerry Nadler saying, even in private calls, that he should step down will lead to him quitting the race. Biden can only handle so much of that because the more that goes on, the more it gives room and safety for other Democrats to come out.\n\nIs there more going on behind the scenes that\u2019s convinced Biden and his allies that he should stay in the race?\n\nThere has been some exaggeration in how bad Biden\u2019s poll numbers actually are. Yes, Biden has dipped in the polls, but it has not been a free fall and it is still a very close race. Historically, what we tend to see is that if a politician takes a hit in the polls because of a particular incident, it tends to be pretty short-lived. What the Biden people are likely thinking is, \u2018Yes, we took a hit in the polls after the debate, but if you give it two weeks, the race will return to where it was before the debate.\u2019\n\nWhen Trump got convicted on 34 felony counts in May 2024, that just barely moved the poll numbers. People may not be happy with the choice of Trump versus Biden, but most people know who they are going to pick in that circumstance.\n\nMost people running for office are pretty immune to attacks from the other party. What hurts the most is when people in your own party start to criticize you.\n\nThat is what is happening here with Biden. The Biden people are saying that if everyone just got on board, we would not see any dip in the polls.",

        "text": "How to vote in the 2024 Massachusetts primary and general elections\nWant to read up on your options for Nov. 5? Here\u2019s the latest guide from GBH News.\n\nFrom ballot questions to U.S. senator to president, Massachusetts voters will soon get the opportunity to make their voices heard in the state primary on Sept. 3, and the general presidential election on Nov. 5. Here\u2019s your step-by-step guide to exercise your civic duty.\n\n\n\nImportant dates\n\nMark these key dates on your calendar:\n\n\n\nAug. 24, 2024 : Deadline to register to vote for Massachusetts primary\n\n: Deadline to register to vote for Massachusetts primary Aug. 26, 2024 : Deadline to apply for vote by mail in the state primary\n\n: Deadline to apply for vote by mail in the state primary Sept. 3, 2024 : Massachusetts primary. Polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.\n\n: Massachusetts primary. Polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Oct. 26, 2024 : Deadline to register to vote for general election\n\n: Deadline to register to vote for general election Oct. 29, 2024 : Deadline to apply for vote by mail for general election\n\n: Deadline to apply for vote by mail for general election Nov. 5, 2024: General election. Polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.\n\nHow to register to vote for the primary and general elections\n\nThe first step to vote in the 2024 Massachusetts primary or the presidential election is to make sure you are registered. If you\u2019ve never registered before, recently became a citizen or if you\u2019ve moved since the last time you voted, even if it\u2019s within the same district, you need to register to vote.\n\nYou can register to vote online , by mail or in person. Learn more here to access the necessary forms , or check with your local election office. You\u2019ll need to provide a license, state ID or social security number to register.\n\nDid you know? About 63% of voters in Massachusetts are not enrolled in a political party.\n\nWhen you register to vote, you\u2019ll be asked if you want to enroll in a party or stay unenrolled. If you want to switch parties, you will need to re-register.\n\nAnyone can register, as long as you are:\n\n\n\n18 years old, or will be 18 by the time of the election (you can pre-register when you\u2019re 16)\n\nA U.S. citizen and resident of Massachusetts\n\nNot incarcerated for a felony\n\nIf you\u2019re doing certain things at the Registry of Motor Vehicles or MassHealth , such as applying to renew your driver\u2019s license or applying for MassHealth benefits, you may be automatically registered to vote. But if you\u2019ve moved recently, you still need to re-register.\n\nDeadlines: You must register by Aug. 24 to vote in Massachusetts\u2019 primary and by Oct. 26 for the general election.\n\nIssues, ballot questions and candidates on your ballot\n\nIn the September primary, you\u2019ll be voting for each party\u2019s nominee for U.S. senator, the seat currently held by Elizabeth Warren, who is seeking re-election. You\u2019ll also see races depending on your district, such as U.S. representative, governor\u2019s council, state representative, clerk court positions and several other offices.\n\nDid you know? According to a GBH News/CommonWealth Beacon poll released in April, Massachusetts voters say the top issue facing the state is immigration, followed by housing, and inflation and the cost of living.\n\nMany of the Democratic candidates are running unopposed in the primary, including Warren. Republicans have several nominees on the ballot for senator, including Robert Antonellis, an engineer, Ian Cain, president of the Quincy City Council and John Deaton, a lawyer and cryptocurrency advocate.\n\nIn the general election, you\u2019ll be voting on those same races as well as for president. Massachusetts voters will also weigh in on several ballot questions \u2014 which could include a measure about wages for tipped workers, rights for gig economy workers like Uber and Lyft drivers, whether to remove MCAS requirements for graduation, and whether to legalize psychedelic drugs.\n\nYou can preview your ballot here.\n\nYour options for voting\n\nOnce you\u2019ve registered, done your research on the issues and candidates, it\u2019s time to vote. Massachusetts has lots of options for you to decide what works best for you.\n\nAny voter can vote in the primary as long as you\u2019re registered, regardless of whether you\u2019re registered with a specific party; same for the general election.\n\nAbsentee voting and vote by mail\n\nIf you won\u2019t be home on Election Day, are serving in the military or living overseas , are currently incarcerated, or you have religious beliefs or a disability that prevent you from voting in person at your polling place, you may be eligible to vote with an absentee ballot. You can apply by mail, email or fax through your local election office. You\u2019d be using the same ballots as voters who vote by mail and need to meet the same deadlines.\n\nDid you know? The VOTES Act was passed in 2022, aimed to make voting easier, including allowing voters with disabilities to vote electronically.\n\nIt also made mail-in voting permanent for all voters.\n\nAll other voters are entitled to vote by mail for any reason, as long as you\u2019re already registered to vote. You should be sent an application in the mail before the election and you can also apply online .\n\nDeadlines: You must apply to vote absentee or by mail by Aug. 26 to cast a ballot in the Massachusetts primary. For the general election, you must apply to vote absentee or by mail no later than Oct. 29.\n\nOfficials urge voters to apply as early as they can to allow enough time for the mail to arrive. While you\u2019re waiting, you can use the online ballot tracker to follow the status of your ballot.\n\nYou can also choose to return your mail-in ballots in person at your city or town\u2019s local election office or ballot drop boxes \u2014 but not your polling location on Election Day. View Boston\u2019s locations around the city.\n\nEarly voting\n\nIf you prefer to vote in person, you can get a head start and vote early, no reason needed. Early voting for the primary will take place in Boston from Saturday, Aug. 24 to Friday, Aug. 30 . You don\u2019t need to vote at your designated polling location, unlike on Election Day. Locations will be announced soon.\n\nVote in person on Election Day\n\nYou can always vote in person on Election Day, Sept. 3 for the Massachusetts primary and Nov. 5 for the presidential election. Polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Find your polling location here and view your ballot. In most cases, you will not be asked to show an ID to vote.\n\nHow to vote if you\u2019re a college student\n\nIf you\u2019re a college student in Massachusetts, you have a choice on where you vote: At your permanent address in your home state, or at your student address, whether it\u2019s an off-campus address or a dorm. Registering to vote on your campus address does not impact your financial aid or your parents\u2019 tax dependent status. Just remember you can only be registered at one address, and you need to re-register every time you change addresses.\n\nGBH News\u2019 Politics IRL gives young voters to share their thoughts on the 2024 presidential election, and issues like abortion and the economy.\n\nIf you do want to vote at your college address, follow all of the above steps to register before Election Day. If you want to vote at your permanent address, you probably have to vote absentee, so check with your home election office and make sure you apply for a ballot early.\n\nMany colleges in the state, including UMass , provide resources and host registration drives to help students get involved in the democratic process in the leadup to an election, so check with your school.\n\nHow to vote if you have a disability\n\nMassachusetts requires that all polling locations are physically accessible, which should include accessible parking and entrances. Poll workers should be trained to assist voters with disabilities. Every location should have an AutoMARK voting machine for voters to cast their ballot independently. You also have the right to bring someone with you to help in any part of voting.",

        "text": "Russian election meddlers hurting Biden, helping Trump, US intelligence warns\nRussia is turning to a familiar playbook in its attempt to sway the outcome of the upcoming U.S. presidential election, looking for ways to boost the candidacy of former President Donald Trump by disparaging the campaign of incumbent President Joe Biden, according to American intelligence officials.\n\nA new assessment of threats to the November election, shared Tuesday, does not mention either candidate by name. But an intelligence official told reporters that the Kremlin view of the U.S. political landscape has not changed from previous election cycles.\n\n\"We have not observed a shift in Russia's preferences for the presidential race from past elections,\" the official told reporters, agreeing to discuss the intelligence only on the condition of anonymity.\n\nThe official said that preference has been further cemented by \u201cthe role the U.S. is playing with regard to Ukraine and broader policy toward Russia.\u201d\n\nThe caution from U.S. intelligence officials comes nearly four years after it issued a similar warning about the 2020 presidential elections, which pitted then-President Trump against Biden.\n\nMoscow was using \u201ca range of measures to primarily denigrate former Vice President Biden and what it sees as an anti-Russia \u2018establishment,\u2019\u201d William Evanina, the then-head of the U.S. National Counterintelligence and Security Center, said at the time.\n\n\u201cSome Kremlin-linked actors are also seeking to boost President Trump\u2019s candidacy on social media and Russian television,\u201d he added.\n\nA declassified post-election assessment, released in March 2021, reaffirmed the initial findings. Russian President Vladimir Putin authorized \"influence operations aimed at denigrating President Biden's candidacy and the Democratic Party\" while offering support for Trump, the report said.\n\nU.S. intelligence officials said they have been in contact with both presidential campaigns and the candidates but declined to share what sort of information may have been shared.\n\nTrump pushback\n\nThe Trump campaign Tuesday rejected the U.S. intelligence assessment as backward.\n\n\"Vladimir Putin endorsed Joe Biden for President because he knows Biden is weak and can easily be bullied, as evidenced by Putin's years-long invasion of Ukraine,\u201d national press secretary Karoline Leavitt told VOA in an email.\n\n\u201cWhen President Trump was in the Oval Office, Russia and all of America's adversaries were deterred, because they feared how the United States would respond,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe only people in America who don't see this clear contrast between Biden's ineffective weakness versus Trump's effective peace through strength approach are the left-wing stenographers in the mainstream media who write false narratives about Donald Trump for a living,\" she added.\n\nThe Biden campaign has so far not responded to questions from VOA about the new U.S. assessment.\n\nRussian sophistication\n\nRussian officials also have not yet responded to requests for comment on the latest allegations, which accuse the Kremlin of using a \u201cwhole of government\u201d approach to see Trump and other American candidates perceived as favorable to Moscow win in November.\n\n\u201cMoscow is using a variety of approaches to bolster its messaging and lend an air of authenticity to its efforts,\u201d the U.S. intelligence official said. \"This includes outsourcing its efforts to commercial firms to hide its hand and laundering narratives through influential U.S. voices.\"\n\nRussia\u2019s efforts also appear focused on targeting U.S. voters in so-called swing states, states most likely to impact the outcome of the presidential election, officials said.\n\nSome of those efforts have already come to light.\n\nRussia and AI\n\nEarlier Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Justice announced the seizure of two internet domains and of another 968 accounts on the X social media platform, part of what officials described an artificial intelligence-driven venture by Russian intelligence and Russia\u2019s state-run RT news network.\n\nA Justice Department statement said Russian intelligence and RT used specific AI software to create authentic-looking social media accounts to mimic U.S. individuals, \u201cwhich the operators then used to promote messages in support of Russian government objectives.\u201d\n\nA joint advisory, issued simultaneously by the U.S., Canada and the Netherlands, warned Russia was in the process of expanding the AI-fueled influence operation to other social media platforms.\n\nThe U.S. intelligence official who spoke to reporters Tuesday described such use of AI as a \u201cmalign influence accelerant,\u201d and warned the technology had already been deployed, likely by China, in the run-up to Taiwan\u2019s elections this past January.\n\nChina waiting\n\nFor now, though, U.S. intelligence officials see few indications Beijing is seeking to interfere in U.S. elections, as it did in 2020 and 2022.\n\nChina \u201csees little gain in choosing between two parties that are perceived as both seeking to contain Beijing,\" said the U.S. intelligence official, noting things could change.\n\n\u201cThe PRC is seeking to expand its ability to collect and monitor data on U.S. social media platforms, probably to better understand and eventually manipulate public opinion,\u201d the official said. \u201cIn addition, we are watching for whether China might seek to influence select down-ballot races as it did in the 2022 midterm elections.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese Embassy in Washington, which has denied previous U.S. allegations, responded by calling the U.S. \u201cthe biggest disseminator of disinformation.\u201d\n\n\u201cChina has no intention and will not interfere in the US election, and we hope that the US side will not make an issue of China in the election,\u201d spokesperson Liu Pengyu told VOA in an email.\n\n\u2018Chaos agent\u2019\n\nThe new U.S. election threat assessment warns that in addition to concerns about Russia and China, there is growing evidence Iran is seeking to play the role of a \u201cchaos agent\u201d in the upcoming U.S. vote.\n\n\u201cIran seeks to stoke social divisions and undermine confidence in U.S. democratic institutions around the elections,\u201d according to an unclassified version of the assessment.\n\nIt also warned that Tehran \u201chas demonstrated a long-standing interest in exploiting U.S. political and societal tensions through various means, including social media.\u201d\n\nAs an example, officials Tuesday pointed to newly declassified intelligence showing Iran trying to exploit pro-Gaza protests across the U.S.\n\n\"We have observed actors tied to Iran\u2019s government posing as activists online, seeking to encourage protests, and even providing financial support to protesters,\" said National Intelligence Director Avril Haines.\n\nHaines cautioned, though, that Americans who interacted with the Iranian actors \u201cmay not be aware that they are interacting with or receiving support from a foreign government.\"\n\nIranian officials have not yet responded to VOA\u2019s request for comment.\n\n",

        "text": "Republicans call Trump\u2019s move to distance himself from Project 2025 \u2018preposterous\u2019\nDonald Trump\u2019s \u201cpreposterous\u201d efforts to disavow Project 2025, a rightwing blueprint for a radical takeover of the US government if the former president is re-elected in November, have been derided by former Republican figures.\n\nThe Project 2025 plan includes calls for replacing civil servants with Trump loyalists, eliminating the education department, putting the justice department under the president\u2019s thumb and banning the abortion pill.\n\nDemocrats have made concerted efforts to say the 900-plus page document from the conservative Heritage Foundation thinktank would be representative of a second Trump presidency.\n\nBut although it was written by former members of Trump\u2019s first administration, and he regularly echoes its policies in his speeches, last week Trump tried to disown the initiative.\n\nPosting on his Truth Social website, the presumptive Republican nominee claimed to \u201cknow nothing about Project 2025\u201d and have \u201cno idea who is behind it\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cI disagree with some of the things they\u2019re saying and some of the things they\u2019re saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal. Anything they do, I wish them luck, but I have nothing to do with them.\u201d\n\nOlivia Troye, a former White House adviser to Mike Pence who sat in on policy sessions during Trump\u2019s first presidency, said Trump\u2019s attempt to distance himself from Project 2025 was driven by a recognition that its deeply controversial policy prescriptions could sink his election bid.\n\n\u201cThis is preposterous if you look at the collaborators and the authors of this plan,\u201d she told CNN when asked whether Trump\u2019s denial was credible. \u201cA lot of these people\u2026served in Trump\u2019s cabinet during his administration. There are people that I worked with. I sat in those policy meetings with them.\u201d\n\nTroye identified various figures \u2013 including John McEntee, who was Trump\u2019s director of White House personnel, Stephen Miller, a senior adviser in his first administration, Ben Carson, the housing and urban development secretary in his cabinet, and Ken Cuccinelli, a former deputy secretary of homeland security \u2013 as among the project\u2019s leading architects.\n\nCarson has been \u201cout there on the campaign trail\u201d with Trump, she said.\n\n\u201cI think what this is telling us is that Donald Trump knows that what is written in this plan is so extreme that it is damaging to his possibility of getting elected, and that\u2019s what he\u2019s concerned about.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly how do you \u2018disagree\u2019 with something you \u2018know nothing about\u2019 or \u2018have no idea\u2019 who is behind, saying or doing the thing you disagree with?\u201d said former RNC chair and current MSNBC host Michael Steele in echoing Troye\u2019s derision.\n\n\u201cAnd how exactly don\u2019t you know that Project 2025 director Paul Dans served as your chief of staff at the Office of Personnel Management, and associate director Spencer Chretien served as your special assistant and associate director of presidential personnel?\u201d\n\nAmong the plan\u2019s more drastic proposals are to fire thousands of permanent civil servants and replace them with hired conservative Trump loyalists, dismantling the federal education department, asserting presidential power over the justice department \u2013 which is nominally independent \u2013 and a ban on the abortion pill.\n\nThe Democrats, currently in the throes of a fierce internal debate over whether to retain Joe Biden as their presidential candidate, have settled on trying to make Project 2025 a household phrase in a drive to illustrate what a second Trump presidency would mean.\n\nTroye said the project should be seen as a threat not just to Democrats but to moderate conservatives, too.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Because there\u2019s no oversight when they do that. They\u2019ve learned all the lessons during the first Trump term, and that is what is frightening here. I think we need to be paying attention to this, and no amount of distancing by Donald Trump should be believed \u2026I sat in [on] policy-making meetings with these people.\u201d\n\nTrump surrogates have tried to back up his effort to separate himself from the project, with Marco Rubio, a Republican senator from Florida who has been touted as a possible running mate for Trump, claiming in a Sunday interview with CNN that there was no connection between Project 2025 and Trump.\n\n\u201cThinktanks do thinktank stuff. They come up with ideas, they say things,\u201d he said. \u201cBut our party\u2019s candidate for president is Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nHe also dismissed the importance of comments by the Heritage Foundation\u2019s president, Kevin Roberts, who said in an interview with Steve Bannon\u2019s War Room podcast last week that conservative-driven \u201csecond American revolution\u201d will be bloodless \u201cif the left allows it to be\u201d \u2013 viewed by many Democrats as an implied threat of political violence.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not running for president,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cOur candidate\u2019s Donald Trump. I didn\u2019t see Donald Trump say that.\u201d\n\nThe denials appear to be undermined by close studies of the personnel involved in the document\u2019s formulation.\n\nOf the 38 people involved in the writing and editing of Project 2025, 31 of them were nominated to positions in Trump\u2019s administration or transition team \u2013 meaning 81% of the document\u2019s creators held formal roles in Trump\u2019s presidency.",

        "text": "Russia aims to undermine Biden in November election, intel officials say\nRussia\u2019s efforts to influence this year\u2019s U.S. election through information warfare have the same aim as in previous elections \u2014 to undermine President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign and the Democratic Party and weaken public confidence in the electoral process, intelligence officials said Tuesday.\n\nRussia\u2019s election influence operations, which include covert social media accounts and encrypted direct messaging channels, are targeting key voter groups in swing states to exploit political divisions in the U.S. and erode support for Ukraine in the aftermath of Russia\u2019s invasion, officials with the Office of the Director National Intelligence, or ODNI, told reporters.\n\nAsked whether Russia\u2019s information campaign is trying to boost or undermine one of the presidential candidates, an ODNI official said: \"We have not observed a shift in Russia\u2019s preferences for the presidential race from past elections, given the role the U.S. is playing with regard to Ukraine and broader policy toward Russia.\"\n\nIn its assessments of previous elections dating to 2016, the intelligence community concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime sought to sway American public opinion in favor of Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy and denigrate the Democratic Party and its presidential nominees.\n\nFormer U.S. intelligence officials and regional analysts say the Kremlin has long viewed Trump as more sympathetic to Russia, citing his frequently expressed skepticism toward the NATO alliance, his reluctance to criticize Putin and his critical portrayal of Ukraine\u2019s government.\n\nThe Justice Department said Tuesday that Russian actors had created an artificial intelligence-enhanced social media bot farm to spread disinformation in the U.S. and abroad. The U.S., Canada and the Netherlands issued a cybersecurity joint advisory warning companies about the Russian social media bot farm and how to identify the technology it uses.\n\nRussia, China and Iran are the \u201cBig Three\u201d players when it comes to election influence efforts, the ODNI official said. \u201cRussia is a pre-eminent threat, Iran is a chaos agent, and China is holding fire on the presidential race,\u201d the official said.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to see Russia target specific voter demographics, promote divisive narratives and denigrate specific politicians. Moscow seeks to shape electoral outcomes, undermine electoral integrity and amplify domestic divisions,\u201d the ODNI official said.\n\n\u201cTo accomplish this, Moscow is using a variety of approaches to bolster its messaging and lend an air of authenticity to its efforts. This includes outsourcing its efforts to commercial firms to hide its hand and laundering narratives through influential U.S. voices,\u201d the official said.\n\nChina is taking a more cautious approach than Russia, as it believes both political parties are \u201cseeking to contain Beijing,\u201d the official said. But China\u2019s information operations are aimed at influencing public opinion more broadly, and it is trying \u201cto expand its ability to collect and monitor data on U.S. social media platforms, probably to better understand and eventually manipulate public opinion,\u201d the official said.\n\nChina\u2019s information operations are being carried out on TikTok, as well as other social media sites, the official added.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies are looking to see whether China will try to shape the outcomes of specific congressional races, as it did in the 2022 midterm elections, the official said.\n\nThe emergence of AI technology is an \u201caccelerant\u201d for election influence efforts by foreign actors, the official said, allowing the rapid creation of false content that appears authentic.\n\nIn the run-up to the November election, U.S. agencies will be looking out for foreign actors to create deepfakes of politicians, \u201cto flood the information space with false or misleading information\u201d and \u201cto sow doubt about what is real,\u201d the official said.\n\nIn Taiwan\u2019s elections in January, operatives most likely linked to the Chinese government posted dozens of videos online featuring AI-generated newscasters describing purported scandals about Taiwan\u2019s president at the time, the official said. And in India\u2019s recent elections, millions of people clicked on AI-generated ads purporting to show Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other politicians, both living and dead, talking about controversial issues, the official added.\n\nU.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies are also tracking information operations that are not necessarily directly tied to the election but illustrate how foreign governments try to seize on certain issues to worsen divisions in the U.S. or embarrass the U.S. government.\n\nIn an example of \u201celection adjacent\u201d information warfare, Iran has sought to amplify domestic criticism of U.S. policy on the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, National Intelligence Director Avril Haines said in a statement earlier Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIn recent weeks, Iranian government actors have sought to opportunistically take advantage of ongoing protests regarding the war in Gaza, using a playbook we\u2019ve seen other actors use over the years,\u201d Haines said. \u201cWe have observed actors tied to Iran\u2019s government posing as activists online, seeking to encourage protests and even providing financial support to protesters.\u201d\n\nHaines acknowledged that Americans \u201cin good faith\u201d take part in protests over the conflict in Gaza and that freedom to express diverse opinions is \u201cessential to our democracy.\u201d She added that \u201cit is also important to warn of foreign actors who seek to exploit our debate for their own purposes.\u201d\n\nHer statement about Iran\u2019s influence activities and the ODNI\u2019s news briefing on the election \u201cthreat landscape\u201d are part of a new effort by the intelligence community to keep the public informed about foreign efforts to influence America\u2019s democratic processes, officials said.\n\nLawmakers have urged U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies to take a more proactive approach and alert the public about foreign interference efforts. The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner, D-Va., praised the agencies\u2019 latest efforts.\n\n\u201cI have long pushed the intelligence community to be more open with the public about the complex and serious foreign influence threats targeting the United States \u2014 particularly in the context of U.S. elections. Today\u2019s press briefing is a strong step in that direction,\u201d Warner said in a statement.",

        "text": "Voter Purges\nWhen election officials delete names from the voter rolls in an effort to remove outdated registrations or ineligible registrants, this action is called a \u201cpurge.\u201d Sometimes officials accidentally purge eligible voters. As a result, these voters may not receive their usual absentee ballot or may show up to vote on Election Day and find that they can\u2019t cast a regular ballot.\n\nOver the last two decades, jurisdictions have substantially increased the rate at which they purge voter rolls. According to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, over 19 million voters were removed from the rolls between 2020 and 2022. That is an increase of 21 percent compared with 2014\u201316, which was already an increase of 33 percent from the number of voters removed between 2006 and 2008. Heightening the risk of inaccurate purges, election denial groups have been challenging voters\u2019 eligibility on a massive scale and pressuring officials to investigate large numbers of voters based on outdated or unreliable information.\n\nThe Brennan Center advocates to ensure that voter purges are nondiscriminatory and do not disenfranchise eligible voters.",

        "text": "Justice Department Leads Efforts Among Federal, International, and Private Sector Partners to Disrupt Covert Russian Government-Operated Social Media Bot Farm\nNote: View the affidavit for search of 968 X accounts here and affidavit for domains seizure here.\n\nThe Justice Department today announced the seizure of two domain names and the search of 968 social media accounts used by Russian actors to create an AI-enhanced social media bot farm that spread disinformation in the United States and abroad. The social media bot farm used elements of AI to create fictitious social media profiles \u2014 often purporting to belong to individuals in the United States \u2014 which the operators then used to promote messages in support of Russian government objectives, according to affidavits unsealed today.\n\nIn conjunction with the domain seizures and search warrant announced today, the FBI and the Cyber National Mission Force (CNMF), in partnership with Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS), the Netherlands General Intelligence and Security Service (AIVD), Netherlands Military Intelligence and Security Service (MIVD), and Netherlands Police released a joint cybersecurity advisory detailing the technology behind the social media bot farm, including details regarding how the bot farm\u2019s creators leveraged their bespoke AI system in furtherance of the scheme. The advisory will allow social media platforms and researchers to identify and prevent the Russian government\u2019s further use of the technology. In addition, X Corp. (formerly, Twitter) voluntarily suspended the remaining bot accounts identified in the court documents for terms of service violations.\n\n\u201cWith these actions, the Justice Department has disrupted a Russian-government backed, AI-enabled propaganda campaign to use a bot farm to spread disinformation in the United States and abroad,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. \u201cAs the Russian government continues to wage its brutal war in Ukraine and threatens democracies around the world, the Justice Department will continue to deploy all of our legal authorities to counter Russian aggression and protect the American people.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s action demonstrates that the Justice Department and our partners will not tolerate Russian government actors and their agents deploying AI to sow disinformation and fuel division among Americans,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. \u201cAs malign actors accelerate their criminal misuse of AI, the Justice Department will respond and we will prioritize disruptive actions with our international partners and the private sector. We will not hesitate to shut down bot farms, seize illegally obtained internet domains, and take the fight to our adversaries.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s actions represent a first in disrupting a Russian-sponsored Generative AI-enhanced social media bot farm,\u201d said FBI Director Christopher Wray. \u201cRussia intended to use this bot farm to disseminate AI-generated foreign disinformation, scaling their work with the assistance of AI to undermine our partners in Ukraine and influence geopolitical narratives favorable to the Russian government. The FBI is committed to working with our partners and deploying joint, sequenced operations to strategically disrupt our most dangerous adversaries and their use of cutting-edge technology for nefarious purposes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe support all civic engagement, civil dialogue, and a robust exchange of ideas,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Gary Restaino for the District of Arizona. \u201cBut those ideas should be generated by Americans, for Americans. The disruption announced today protects us from those who use unlawful means to seek to mislead our citizens and our communities.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe disruption announced today is the result of a combined response with our international partners to a serious and unique threat,\u201d said Acting U.S. Attorney Morris Pasqual for the Northern District of Illinois. \u201cMultiple U.S. and foreign governmental components worked closely and efficiently to address the threat and develop and execute a mitigation strategy. Through vigorous enforcement efforts and collaborative international partnerships, the Justice Department works tirelessly to disrupt criminal cyber activity.\u201d\n\nOverview\n\nAccording to court documents, a bot farm is an enhanced software package which allows for the creation of false personas on social media platforms. Bot farms are enhanced by integrating components which contain artificial intelligence, such as image production or text generation.\n\nAs described in the affidavits filed in support of the warrants, development of the social media bot farm was organized by an individual identified in Russia (Individual A). In early 2022, Individual A worked as the deputy editor-in-chief at RT, a state-run Russian news organization based in Moscow. Since at least 2022, RT leadership sought the development of alternative means for distributing information beyond RT\u2019s standard television news broadcasts. In response, Individual A led the development of software that was able to create and to operate a social media bot farm. As planned, the social media bot farm would create fictitious online personas for social media accounts, through which RT, or any operator of the bot farm, could distribute information on a wide-scale basis. The development was executed by Individual B and others, who hid their identities and location (Russia) while beginning to purchase infrastructure for the social media bot farm in April 2022.\n\nIn early 2023, with the approval and financial support of the Presidential Administration of Russia (aka the Kremlin), a Russian FSB officer (FSB Officer 1) created and led a private intelligence organization (P.I.O.), as explained in the affidavits. The P.I.O.\u2019s membership was comprised of, among others, employees at RT, including Individual A. The true purpose of the P.I.O. was to advance the mission of the FSB and the Russian government, including by spreading disinformation through the social media accounts created by the bot farm.\n\nAccording to the affidavits, FSB Officer 1, Individual A, and other members of the PIO had access to the social media bot farm. The following are examples of Russian-government narratives that the bot farm posted on X in October and November 2023:\n\nA purported U.S. constituent replied to a candidate for federal office\u2019s social media posts regarding the conflict in Ukraine with a video of President Putin justifying Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine;\n\nA purported resident of Minneapolis, Minnesota, posted a video of President Putin discussing his belief that certain geographic areas of Poland, Ukraine, and Lithuania were \u201cgifts\u201d to those countries from the Russian forces that liberated them from Nazi control during World War II;\n\nA purported U.S. resident of a city identified only as \u201cGresham,\u201d posted a video claiming that the number of foreign fighters embedded with Ukrainian forces was significantly lower than public estimates;\n\nThe same purported individual posted a video of President Putin claiming that the war in Ukraine is not a territorial conflict or a matter of geopolitical balance, but rather the \u201cprinciples on which the New World Order will be based.\u201d\n\nTo register the fictitious social media accounts, the social media bot farm relied on private email servers, which in turn relied on the two domain names seized by the FBI. An individual who controls an internet domain can create email accounts using the domain. For example, an individual controlling the domain name www.example.com can create email accounts using @example.com (e.g., EmailAddress@example.com). Here, the actors obtained and controlled the domain names \u201cmlrtr.com\u201d and \u201cotanmail.com\u201d from a U.S.-based provider. They then used those domains to create the email servers that ultimately allowed them to create fictitious social media accounts using the bot farm software.\n\nThe FSB\u2019s use of U.S.-based domain names, which the software used to register the bots, violates the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. In addition, the accompanying payments for that infrastructure violate federal money laundering laws.\n\nThe Justice Department commends members of the private sector who coordinated with law enforcement efforts on this disruption, including X for its voluntary efforts to suspend the identified bot accounts from its platform. Prior to the government\u2019s action, X identified and suspended a significant number of the bot accounts.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s investigation is ongoing.\n\nThe National Security Division\u2019s National Security Cyber Section, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Arizona, and U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Illinois are prosecuting the case, with valuable assistance from the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.",

        "text": "This Media Bias Detector Analyzes News Reports in Real Time\nThe following article was originally published on Penn Today.\n\nThe 2024 U.S. presidential debates kicked off June 27, with President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump sharing the stage for the first time in four years. Duncan Watts, a computational social scientist from the University of Pennsylvania, considers this an ideal moment to test a tool his lab has been developing during the last six months: the Media Bias Detector.\n\n\u201cThe debates offer a real-time, high-stakes environment to observe and analyze how media outlets present and potentially skew the same event,\u201d says Watts, a Penn Integrates Knowledge Professor with appointments in the Annenberg School for Communication, School of Engineering and Applied Science, and Wharton School. \u201cWe wanted to equip regular people with a powerful, useful resource to better understand how major events, like this election, are being reported on.\u201d\n\nThe Media Bias Detector uses artificial intelligence to analyze articles from major news publishers, categorizing them by topic, detecting events, and examining factors like tone, partisan lean, and fact selection.\n\nWatts and a few members of his team at the Computational Social Science Lab (CSSLab) discuss their motivations for creating the Media Bias Detector, rationale for launching this tool ahead of the presidential debates, and key insights from the project.\n\nWhat Sparked the Debate Around Media Narratives\n\nWatts says the idea of the Detector has been brewing for years, long before he joined Penn in 2019, when he\u2019d read articles on topics he happened to have expertise in and started to realize that \u201csome of this is just complete hogwash,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cBut that really got me thinking: What about the stuff that I don\u2019t know about? Is that all just fine, and the only problematic information out there is just the stuff I happen to know about?\u2019\u201d\n\nWatts also cites anecdotes from early in his career when he\u2019d talk to reporters who clearly knew what they wanted to say before reporting the piece. \u201cI\u2019d offer a perspective that didn\u2019t fit their preselected narrative, so they would just not quote me, which was kind of frustrating,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, I think I\u2019ve always had some concerns about how media can distort the world through the lens of presenting a particular set of facts in a particular order.\u201d\n\nBut, as with many people, Watts says, \u201cthose concerns grew following the coverage of the 2016 election. It made me think that media bias might actually be a big problem, not just a nuisance in my little corner of the information landscape.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe wanted to equip regular people with a powerful, useful resource to better understand how major events, like this election, are being reported on.\u201d\u2014 Duncan Watts\n\nTo that end, Watts started investigating how some of the ways information related to the election and other global events circa 2016 were covered and began to see that media narratives about \u201cmisinformation,\u201d \u201cfake news,\u201d and \u201cecho chambers\u2019 were in and of themselves misleading and in some instances \u201coverblown.\u201d\n\nA recent study led by Watts from CSSLab published in Nature reviews years of behavioral science research on the effects of exposure to false and radical online content online, and finds that such exposure is minimal for most, save the most extreme people.\n\nIn the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election, Watts says, many people maligned the echo chambers they believed they saw taking over social media. People with like-minded friends were all sharing content online with the same political bent, amplifying a singular set of messages and leading to greater polarization overall.\n\nHowever, according to research led by Watts, just 4% of Americans actually fell into such echo chambers online. But the number for television was much higher, with 17% of people in the U.S. consuming TV news from only partisan left- or right-leaning sources, news diets they tend to maintain month over month.\n\nThese experiences led Watts to believe there was a problem with how media presents information, but it seemed out of reach to build something that could consolidate news articles in real time with a high degree of granularity and let people know where the biases were.\n\n\u201cThe methods that could do this sort of classification at scale didn\u2019t work sufficiently well until the latest generation of large language models (LLMs) arrived towards the end of 2022,\u201d Watts says. \u201cThe popularization of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT truly changed the game and made it possible for our team to design the Detector around OpenAI\u2019s GPT infrastructure.\u201d\n\nLeveraging LLMs to Build the Media Bias Detector\n\nPlaying crucial roles in leveraging these LLMs to build the Detector were Samar Haider, a fourth-year PhD student in the School of Engineering and Applied Science; Amir Tohidi, a postdoctoral researcher in the CSSLab; and Yuxuan Zhang, the lab\u2019s data scientist.\n\nHaider, who focuses on the intersection of natural language processing and computational social science, explains that the team \u201cgives GPT the article and asks it to say which of a list of topics it belongs to and, for events, to compare the meaning or semantic similarity of the text.\u201d\n\nTo manage this massive influx of data, the team developed its own pipeline.\n\n\u201cWe then break the process into two parts: categorizing articles by topics using GPT and clustering articles into events using a sliding window approach to compare their text,\u201d Tohidi says. \u201cThis method allows the Detector to not only label articles accurately but also to detect emerging topics and events in real time.\u201d\n\nHowever, Tohidi says human judgment remains a critical component of their system. Every week, research assistants read a subset of articles to verify GPT\u2019s labels, ensuring they maintain high accuracy and can adjust for any errors they may encounter along the way.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re currently scraping 10 major news websites every few hours and pulling the top 10 articles, which is a few hundred articles per publisher per day, and processing all of that data. We\u2019re planning to increase it to the top 30 articles for our future versions to better represent media coverage. It\u2019s a massive task,\u201d Zhang says, \u201cbut it\u2019s essential for keeping the tool up to date and reliable.\u201d\n\nUnderstanding the Biases in Media Coverage\n\nHaider notes that in building the tool he has come to appreciate the power of biases in language, such as when the same set of facts can convey different messages depending on how writers use them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just incredibly fascinating to see how these subtle differences in the way you can report on an event, like how you put sentences together or the words you can use, can lead to changes for the reader that journalists might not realize because of their own biases,\u201d Haider says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about detecting bias but understanding how these subtle cues can influence the reader\u2019s perception.\u201d\n\nWatts says that, while the current version of the Detector doesn\u2019t have this feature integrated yet, he, too, has come to see how much of an impact small decisions in reporting can have.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about detecting bias but understanding how these subtle cues can influence the reader\u2019s perception.\u201d\u2014 Samar Haider\n\nHe notes that in watching how this component can take in the facts and generate articles, some with a positive spin and others negative, \u201cit is a little spooky to see how much you can alter things without lying. But it\u2019s also potentially a really cool feature that can write differently biased synthetic articles about events on the fly.\u201d\n\nWatts says that there is no shortage of people who love to criticize journalists and that he isn\u2019t trying to add fuel to the fire or create an AI tool to replace reporters. Rather, he and the CSSLab have created the Media Bias Detector in recognition of the importance of journalism.\n\n\u201cJournalists are crucial, as the fourth estate,\u201d Watts says. \u201cWe want this tool to hold up a data-driven mirror to current journalistic practices, both good and bad, and to help the public and journalists themselves better understand the biases present in media coverage.\u201d\n\nHe emphasizes the importance of high-quality journalism in democratic societies and hopes the Detector will help improve transparency and accountability in news reporting.",

The plain fact is that only one party in America\u2019s two-party system is ready to defend our constitutional order anymore. The other party is interested only in gaining and holding power for the sake of it.\n\nThe G.O.P.\u2019s moral emptiness is manifested in several ways. The party has been purged of virtually every Republican politician unwilling to submit to its Dear Leader \u2014 Donald Trump, who attempted to overturn our last presidential election. The wife of a Republican-appointed Supreme Court justice advocated overturning the results of the election on utterly bogus grounds, which shows you just how little respect that party now has for our sacred institutions. And it is ready to renominate Trump even though many of those who worked most intimately with him in his first term \u2014 including his vice president, secretary of defense, secretary of state, chief of staff, national security adviser, press secretary, communications director and attorney general \u2014 have warned the country in speeches, interviews and memoirs that Trump is erratic, immoral and someone who must never be let near the White House again.",

        "text": "The $240 million question: Who gets Joe Biden's campaign money if he drops out?\nIf President Joe Biden exits the 2024 race, he'll leave behind hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign funds. He currently has $240 million split across a group of fundraising committees, according to Biden's campaign, which refers to its joint operation as Team Biden-Harris.\n\nThat's far more than sits in the war chests of any alternative Democratic nominee, including high-profile governors who have been campaigning nationally to fundraise for their own PACs.\n\nBut where the money trail would lead from there is unclear, because nothing like this has happened before. Even when President Lyndon B. Johnson dropped out of the 1968 presidential election, current campaign finance laws did not exist.\n\nHere's a rundown of where Team Biden-Harris' campaign money is stashed and where it would go if the president dropped out.\n\nBiden for President\n\nThis is the primary campaign committee for President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, and it had $91.6 million in the bank at the end of May. The conventional wisdom is that Harris would inherit this money if she became the nominee because her name is on the campaign's formation documents. And federal law says money of a presidential campaign also belongs to the vice presidential nominee.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nDan Weiner, the director of the Brennan Center for Justice's Elections & Government Program, cautioned that the law leaves a lot of gray area. \"It\u2019s not crystal clear because I\u2019m not sure if the people who drafted the Federal Election Campaign Act anticipated this situation,\" he said.\n\nIf Harris indeed gets the money, this would be Harris' only existing funding source. Her old war chests from her 2020 run for president and 2016 run for US Senate have both been zeroed out and deactivated.\n\nDemocratic National Committee\n\nThe Democratic Party ended May with $65.2 million in its campaign war chest. While this money has become synonymous with Biden's presidential campaign, political parties use their money to support whoever their nominee is. That means that if Biden drops out of the campaign, this money would likely be used to support the campaign of whoever wins the nomination at the August convention.\n\n\"The DNC keeps that money and would presumably use it for the Democratic nominee, whether it\u2019s President Biden or someone else,\" Weiner said. \"And I want to emphasize right now that all signs point to \u2014 it\u2019s going to be President Biden.\"\n\nJoint fundraising committees\n\nBiden has three joint fundraising committees that pull in donations through a single account and then distribute them among many other PACs, ranging from his presidential campaign to local Democratic parties and the campaigns of members of Congress. At the end of March, Biden Victory Fund had $41.1 million; Biden Action Fund had $19.4 million; and Democratic Grassroots Victory Fund had $1.6 million.\n\nJoint fundraising committees are authorized by the groups receiving the money, and they form with written agreements saying how much money goes to each of those groups. That means, for example, that part of the Biden Victory Fund money belongs to Biden for President.\n\nHowever, it's common for these types of committees to file new paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to change how much money is allocated to which groups, and they might do that if Biden dropped out of the race.\n\nSuper PACs\n\nThe main super PAC supporting Biden is Future Forward, which ended May with $92.4 million in cash. Because super PACs are legally required to operate independently from candidates, Biden wouldn't have any official say in how this money is spent.\n\nThe leaders of Future Forward or any other super PACs currently supporting Biden may decide to spend the money on helping elect the new Democratic candidate for president, transfer the money to another super PAC, or refund the money to the donors.\n\nNewsom, Pritzker, Whitmer have small sums\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom ended December with $3.5 million in his 2022 gubernatorial campaign account. His national super PAC, Campaign for Democracy Group, ended March with $6 million, and the affiliated Campaign for Democracy PAC ended March with $6.2 million.\n\nIllinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker ended March with $7.7 million in his state account for governor. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's gubernatorial campaign ended December with about $400,000 in the bank, and her Fight Like Hell PAC ended March with $1.8 million.\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg had $1.4 million in his Win the Era PAC at the end of March.",

        "text": "Republicans, Democrats continue to differ sharply on voting access\nSix-in-ten Americans say any U.S. voter should have the option to vote early or absentee without having to document a reason, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey.\n\nBut there are wide partisan divides on this question:\n\n82% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say early or absentee voting should be available to any voter without the need for an excuse.\n\n62% of Republicans and Republican leaners say these voting methods should only be available to those who have a documented reason for not voting in person on Election Day.\n\nBoth early and absentee voting are far more common today than in prior decades. In the 2022 midterm election, fewer than half of voters cast their ballots in person on Election Day. And in 2020 \u2013 the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic \u2013 only about a quarter did so.\n\nHow we did this Pew Research Center conducted this analysis to understand how Americans view early and absentee voting ahead of the 2024 presidential election. For this analysis, we surveyed 8,638 U.S. adults from May 13 to 19, 2024. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology. Here are the questions used for this analysis, along with responses, and its methodology.\n\nHow views of no-excuse early and absentee voting have changed in recent years\n\nAmericans are now less likely to support no-excuse early or absentee voting than they were prior to the 2020 election. This is the result of shifting views among Republicans.\n\nIn 2018, when we first asked this question, a 57% majority of Republicans said that any voter should have the option to vote early or by absentee ballot without having to document a reason. They are now 20 percentage points less likely to say this.\n\nIn contrast, Democrats\u2019 views on this question are essentially unchanged over the past six years. Since 2018, about eight-in-ten Democrats have said no-excuse early or absentee voting should be available to any voter.\n\nHow views of no-excuse early and absentee voting differ by state\n\nAmericans who live in states where mail-in ballots will automatically be sent to every voter this November are more likely to have a favorable view of no-excuse early or absentee voting than those who live in states where voters have to request absentee ballots.\n\nAbout seven-in-ten adults in states with universal mail-in ballot access (69%) say any voter should have the option to vote early or absentee without having to document a reason.\n\nThis view is shared by a narrower 59% majority of Americans living in states where ballots are not automatically mailed, but where any voter can request a mail-in ballot without an excuse.\n\n55% of adults in states that require a valid excuse to vote by mail say no-excuse early or absentee voting should be available to all voters.\n\nViews differ within each party, but differences are more pronounced among Republicans: Nearly half of Republicans living in states where every voter receives a mail-in ballot (47%) favor no-excuse early or absentee voting, compared with 34% of Republicans living in states where a voter must request a mail-in ballot.\n\nRegardless of a state\u2019s policies, Democrats are substantially more likely than Republicans to back no-excuse early and absentee voting.\n\nHow views of voting access differ by demographic factors, ideology\n\nThere are moderate differences in views of no-excuse early or absentee voting by race and ethnicity, age, and education.\n\nRace and ethnicity\n\nNearly three-quarters of Black adults (74%) say any voter should have the option to vote early or absentee without an excuse. Smaller majorities of White (59%), Asian (59%) and Hispanic (56%) adults say the same.\n\nAge\n\nAdults younger than 30 are more likely than those in older age groups to support no-excuse early or absentee voting.\n\nEducation\n\nRoughly seven-in-ten Americans with a postgraduate degree (71%) favor no-excuse early or absentee voting. This compares with 67% of college graduates, 60% of those who have some college experience but no four-year degree, and 52% of Americans with a high school degree or less education.\n\nParty and ideology\n\nIn both parties, views differ by ideology:\n\nLiberal Democrats are 17 points more likely than conservative or moderate Democrats to back no-excuse early or absentee voting (92% vs. 75%).\n\nModerate and liberal Republicans are 15 points more likely than conservative Republicans to support these voting methods (47% vs. 32%).\n\nWould making it easier to vote have an effect on election security?\n\nDemographic and ideological differences also surface on the question of whether elections would be less secure if the rules were changed to make it easier to register and vote.\n\nRace and ethnicity\n\nAbout three-quarters of Black adults (74%) say that changing the rules in this way would not make elections any less secure. About six-in-ten Asian adults say this (62%), as do 56% of Hispanic adults and 55% of White adults.\n\nAge\n\nAdults under 50 are modestly more likely than those ages 50 and older to say that changing election rules would not make elections any less secure (61% vs. 55%).\n\nEducation\n\nAmericans with at least a four-year college degree are 10 points more likely than those without a degree to say this (64% vs. 54%).\n\nParty and ideology\n\nAround nine-in-ten liberal Democrats (91%) say that changing the rules to make it easier to vote would not make elections less secure. A smaller majority of conservative and moderate Democrats (70%) also say this.\n\nBy contrast, nearly seven-in-ten conservative Republicans (69%) say that elections would be less secure if the rules were changed to make it easier to register and vote. A narrower majority of moderate and liberal Republicans (54%) say this.\n\nCategorizing state voting laws To categorize states by their voting laws, we relied on data from the National Conference of State Legislatures. We accessed this data on July 3, 2024, and it was last updated on Dec. 20, 2023.\n\nNote: Here are the questions used for this analysis, along with responses, and its methodology.",

        "text": "The cases against fake electors and where they stand - CREW\nAs part of Donald Trump and his allies\u2019 nationwide effort to undermine the 2020 presidential election, 84 total fake electors across seven states signed false electoral certificates claiming that Trump won the election in their states. As of July 2024, fake electors from Arizona, Georgia, Michigan and Nevada have been charged with crimes, and the remaining fake electors in New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin do not currently face charges.\n\nClick here to jump straight to the table\n\nIn Arizona, the final three fake electors involved in efforts to illegally overturn the 2020 presidential election were arraigned on June 18, 2024. Atrial date has been set for January 5, 2026. In total, 11 fake electors and seven Trump aides including former Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani and former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows are facing charges for their involvement in Arizona. On August 7, Lorraine Pellegrino, one of the 11 fake electors, pleaded guilty to the charge of filing a false instrument.\n\nAt least three of the 16 fake electors in Georgia have been indicted and face prosecution, while eight have agreed to immunity deals. Lieutenant Governor Burt Jones, who was a state senator at the time he allegedly falsified electoral certificates, is facing a special investigation by a state prosecutor.\n\nA Michigan trial court is receiving ongoing witness testimony including from James Renner, a fake elector who entered a deal with the government. The remaining 15 fake electors may or may not be charged\u2014notably, prosecutors must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the fake electors knew they were breaking the law when they signed the fraudulent certificates, and Renner has testified that he and the other defendants were unaware that what they were doing was illegal.\n\nThe case against Nevada\u2019s six fake electors was dismissed on June 21, 2024 with the judge explaining that the cases needed to refiled in Douglas County, Nevada where the false electoral certificates were originally signed. The judge who dismissed the case without prejudice called the scheme \u201ca crime that has occurred in another jurisdiction.\u201d\n\nIn three other states, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, charges against the fake electors have not been filed. In both New Mexico and Pennsylvania the fake electors added a clause to their false electoral certificates saying that their votes should be counted only if a court found them to be valid electors. In Pennsylvania, that conditional clause makes it unlikely the fake electors will be criminally prosecuted, while the attorney general in New Mexico has explained that its state\u2019s laws criminalizing forgery do not cover signing false electoral certificates. In Wisconsin, the individuals who delivered the fake electoral certificates to Congress have been indicted, but charges have not been filed against the fake electors themselves. Because the fake electors themselves have yet to face criminal accountability, Wisconsin is therefore noted not to have filed charges against its fake electors in this tracker.\n\nThe dozens of indictments across the four states that have brought charges so far reflect the gravity of the fake electors\u2019 actions and the importance of accountability for those who participated. In order to best protect against another fake electors scheme in the future, all those who violated state and federal laws to undermine the 2020 election should be held legally accountable.\n\nThe table below reflects the current status of each state in regards to indicting its fake electors, including whether charges have been filed, the status of the cases, the number of fake electors and whether the fake electors had contact or were coordinating with the Trump campaign.",

        "text": "Biden news: Why I support\u2014but fear\u2014a Kamala Harris presidential run.\nUpdate, July 21, 2024, at 4:04 p.m.: Joe Biden has announced he has decided to end his run for president and subsequently endorsed Kamala Harris. Below, Jill Filipovic expressed her apprehension at a Harris candidacy in early July.\n\nLet\u2019s just come out and say it: The prospect of the vice president replacing Joe Biden on the 2024 ticket would be much easier if the vice president were a white guy.\n\nThis fact is foundationally, fundamentally unfair and deeply enraging. As much as conservatives are branding Harris a \u201cDEI candidate,\u201d the truth is that, in electoral politics, race and gender work overwhelmingly to the benefit of white men. The United States has had 235 years of unbroken male rule. In that same time, we have had one Black president\u2014a man of outstanding, once-in-a-generation political talents. Kamala Harris is the first female vice president, and the first female vice president of color, in a country where both houses of Congress remain largely white and largely male. A Harris win would usher the first woman, and the first woman of color, into the presidency\u2014a history-making possibility, and a deeply exciting one.\n\nBut then: 2016.\n\nThose of us who were sure Hillary Clinton would smoke Donald Trump may be uniquely ill-situated to evaluate Harris\u2019 potential candidacy. Here is a truly horrifying and humiliating admission: I was equal parts appalled and relieved when the Republican Party chose Donald Trump as their candidate, because while I thought selecting him certainly signaled a deep rot in the GOP base, I also thought he was the weakest, most beatable candidate the party had run in my lifetime. In other words, he was a uniquely helpful one to pit against a highly competent feminist woman. Coming at the tail end of the Obama years, I genuinely believed that Americans would watch Trump sputter incoherent nonsense, go on racist and misogynist rants, and demean his female rival, and they would watch Clinton put forward lucid, reasoned policy proposals and approach the office of the presidency with the dignity and respect it deserved, and that victory would be easy for her. Sure, lots of conservative voters didn\u2019t like her, and I was under no illusions that America had somehow solved sexism by electing a Black man and then seeing Democrats run a white woman. But Trump was such an obvious con man who said such disgusting things and comported himself like such an all-out bozo that I simply could not imagine a critical mass of Americans, no matter their politics, listening to him and concluding: This is the guy who should have the nuclear codes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd yes, Clinton did win the popular vote by a margin of nearly 3 million votes. But she still lost the election\u2014and I lost a whole lot of faith in the American public, and trust in my own perceptions of it.\n\nPerhaps the clearest takeaway from the 2016 election is that, faced with the prospect of a female president following a Black president, a huge number of mostly white American voters absolutely lost their minds. Yes, Clinton had drawbacks as a candidate. But a politics of rage coalesced around Clinton\u2019s candidacy that simply cannot be explained by the fact that, say, she\u2019s a liberal and leftists wanted a socialist (or she didn\u2019t campaign in Michigan.) Joe Biden, after all, ran as a centrist and with a legislative record more moderate than Clinton\u2019s a mere four years later and did not draw nearly the same level of unhinged ire. The misogyny that rained down on Clinton was mostly a right-wing storm, but there was a sexist tempest on the left, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s now 2024, and perhaps the country has changed. Maybe, after eight years of two old white men, the voters who fear and resent a woman in power have been duly pacified; some of them have probably died. The fear, though\u2014my fear\u2014is that the same dynamics that triggered a full-on post-Obama meltdown over Hillary Clinton will come roaring back if Harris is at the top of the ticket.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut then here is the rub: If we fear the candidacy-killing potential of racism and sexism too much, we create a self-fulfilling prophecy, and we hand forever rule to white men.\n\nThe risks of running Harris are different than the risks of running Biden again, but I am not convinced that they are larger. In fact, it\u2019s hard to argue that Harris is the weaker candidate at this stage. She is part of an administration that has accomplished a great deal, and she\u2019s the most visible member of that administration who is capable of talking about abortion, the one issue Democrats are strongest on. (She\u2019s also capable of simply talking for more than a few minutes at a time and past 8 p.m., which is a plus.) She has enough distance from Biden on foreign policy that she may be able to avoid being totally hamstrung by the Israel/Gaza issue, which deeply divides Democratic voters and seems guaranteed to disrupt the Democratic convention. Her weaknesses in 2020\u2014primarily her history as a tough-on-crime prosecutor, which was summed up by the leftist jeer of \u201cKamala is a cop\u201d\u2014were specific to an extremely odd election year, and look a whole lot more like assets in a 2024 race against a convicted felon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd from a purely practical perspective, one of the biggest benefits of elevating Harris on the ticket is that she will likely have an easier time using Biden-Harris campaign funds for her own run. There is little doubt Republicans will challenge her candidacy in court\u2014it should tell you something that many of them want Biden, not Harris, as the Democratic presidential nominee\u2014but the fact that she\u2019s already running with Biden certainly makes any replacement of him a simpler financial proposition.\n\nPlus, she\u2019s been nationally vetted. Perhaps the hyper-ambitious and well-groomed politicos whose names float to the top of the potential replacement pool are serially well-behaved Girl Scouts whose closets are as clean as their noses. Or perhaps they\u2019re John Edwards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s one more key way in which the America of 2024 is not the America of 2016: This America has experienced 2016 and its aftermath. Voters who thought they would see the first female president felt the shock and sting of her loss, a seismic event that spawned the Women\u2019s March, the #MeToo movement, and elections that put record numbers of women in office. Just a few years later, American voters also saw women\u2019s rights rolled back by a half-century (and in some states, to a time before women could vote) by unaccountable far-right Supreme Court justices, three of whom were appointed by the profoundly misogynist vulva grabber who beat out the woman who seemed poised to be the first in the White House.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVoters who care about women\u2019s rights know the stakes; we know, in a way we could not have known in 2016, just how hard it hits when we collectively butt up against America\u2019s oldest and strongest glass ceiling.\n\nSo yes, it\u2019s rational to be nervous about a potential Harris run, and to be nervous about factors that are entirely out of Harris\u2019 control. But it\u2019s not rational to conclude that, because one woman lost eight years ago, this woman can\u2019t win. Of course she can. We\u2014and the guy currently at the top of the ticket\u2014just need to give her a chance.",

        "text": "2024 French election results no big win for far-right, but next steps unclear. Here's what could happen.\nParis \u2014 Election results show French voters have chosen to give a broad leftist coalition the most parliamentary seats in pivotal legislative elections, keeping the far right away from power. Yet no party won an outright majority, putting France in an uncertain, unprecedented situation.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron's centrist alliance arrived in second position. The far-right, led by Marine Le Pen's National Rally party, came in third \u2014 still drastically increasing the number of seats it holds in the National Assembly, France's lower house of parliament.\n\nSupporters of the left gathered in central Paris Sunday night to heave a collective sigh of relief as exit polls showed the French far-right's dream of taking power had been dashed. As CBS News correspondent Elaine Cobbe reported, masked protestors clashed with police on the sidelines of the rally.\n\nWith the results split, no clear figure had emerged by Monday as a possible future prime minister.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron casts his ballot flanked by French First Lady Brigitte Macron at a polling station, to vote in the second round of French parliamentary elections in Le Touquet-Paris-Plage, France, July 7, 2024. MOHAMMED BADRA/POOL\n\nMacron says he will wait to decide his next steps, and he heads to Washington this week for a NATO summit. The new legislators can start work in parliament on Monday, and their first new session starts July 18.\n\nPrime minister offers resignation, Macron asks him to stick around\n\nPrime Minister Gabriel Attal offered his resignation on Monday but Macron instead asked him to remain \"temporarily\" as head of the government after the chaotic election results left the government in limbo. Attal has said he is ready to remain in the post during the upcoming Paris Olympics and for as long as needed.\n\nAttal's government will handle current affairs pending further political negotiations.\n\nMacron's office says he will \"wait for the new National Assembly to organize itself\" before making any decisions on the new government.\n\nThere is no firm timeline for when Macron must name a prime minister, and no firm rule that he has to pick someone from the largest party in parliament.\n\nThe president's term runs until 2027, and Macron has said he will not step down before its end.\n\nMacron is a weakened president, but he's still the president\n\nWith no majority and little possibility of implementing his own plans, Macron comes out weakened from the elections.\n\nIn line with France's Constitution, he still holds some powers over foreign policy, European affairs and defense and is in charge of negotiating and ratifying international treaties. The president is also the commander-in-chief of the country's armed forces and holds the nuclear codes.\n\nThere's a possibility the new prime minister would be unable or unwilling to seriously challenge Macron's defense and foreign policy powers and would focus instead on domestic politics.\n\nThe prime minister is accountable to parliament, leads the government and introduces bills.\n\nFrench election results to force compromise and consensus\n\nThree major political blocs emerged from the elections \u2014 yet none of them is close to the majority of at least 289 seats out of 577 required to form a government on its own. The National Assembly is the most important of France's two houses of parliament. It has the final say in the law-making process over the Senate, which is dominated by conservatives.\n\nWhile not uncommon in other European countries, modern France has never experienced a parliament with no dominant party. Such a situation requires lawmakers to build consensus across parties to agree on government positions and legislation.\n\nFrance's fractious politics and deep divisions over taxes, immigration and Mideast policy make that especially challenging.\n\nThis means Macron's centrist allies won't be able to implement their pro-business policies, including a promise to overhaul unemployment benefits. It could also make passing a budget more difficult.\n\nA coalition government? A government of experts?\n\nMacron may seek a deal with the moderate left to create a joint government. Such negotiations, if they happen, are expected to be very difficult because France has no tradition of this kind of arrangement.\n\nThe deal could take the form of a loose, informal alliance \u2014 which would likely be fragile.\n\nMacron has said he would not work with the hard-left France Unbowed party, but he could possibly stretch out a hand to the Socialists and the Greens. They may refuse to take it, however.\n\nHis government last week suspended a decree that would have diminished workers' rights to unemployment benefits, which has been interpretated as a gesture toward the left.\n\nIf he can't make a political deal, Macron could name a government of experts unaffiliated with political parties. Such a government would likely deal mostly with day-to-day affairs of keeping France running.\n\nComplicating matters: Any of those options would require parliamentary approval.\n\nThe left has been torn by divisions in the past months, especially after the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas on Israel.\n\nFrance Unbowed has been sharply criticized by other more moderate leftists for its stance on the conflict. Hard-left leaders have staunchly condemned the conduct of Israel's war with Hamas and accused it of pursuing genocide against Palestinians. They have faced accusations of antisemitism, which they strongly deny.\n\nThe Socialists ran independently for the European Union elections last month, winning about 14% of the votes, when France Unbowed got less than 10% and the Greens 5.5%.\n\nYet Macron's move to call snap legislative elections pushed leftist leaders to quickly agree on forming a new coalition, the New Popular Front.\n\nTheir joint platform promises to raise the minimum salary from 1,400 to 1,600 euros ($1,515 to $1,735), to pull back Macron's pension reform that increased the retirement age from 62 to 64 and to freeze prices of essential food products and energy. All that has financial markets worried.",

        "text": "House passes bill requiring proof of citizenship to vote, fanning a GOP election-year talking point\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday passed a proof-of-citizenship requirement for voter registration, a proposal Republicans have prioritized as an election-year talking point even as research shows noncitizens illegally registering and casting ballots in federal elections is exceptionally rare.\n\nThe legislation, approved largely along partisan lines but with a few Democrats voting in favor, is unlikely to advance through the Democratic-led Senate. The Biden administration also says it\u2019s strongly opposed because it says safeguards already are in place to verify voter eligibility and enforce the law against noncitizen voting.\n\nStill, the House vote will give Republicans an opportunity to bring attention to two of their central issues this year \u2014 border and election security.\n\nIt also provides an opportunity to fuel former President Donald Trump\u2019s claims that Democrats have encouraged the surge of migrants so they can register them to vote, which would be illegal. Noncitizens are not allowed to vote in federal elections, nor is it allowed for any statewide elections.\n\nWATCH: How right-wing disinformation is fueling conspiracy theories about the 2024 election\n\nResearch and audits in several states show there have been incidences of noncitizens who successfully registered to vote and cast ballots, but it happens rarely and is typically by mistake. States have mechanisms to check for it, although there isn\u2019t one standard protocol they all follow.\n\nRepublican House Speaker Mike Johnson, a key backer of the bill, said in a news conference earlier this week that the Democratic opposition means many Democrats \u201cwant illegals to participate in our federal elections; they want them to vote.\u201d\n\nDuring a speech Wednesday, he called the vote a \u201cgeneration-defining moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf just a small percentage, a fraction of a fraction of all those illegals that Joe Biden has brought in here to vote, if they do vote, it wouldn\u2019t just change one race,\u201d he said. \u201cIt might potentially change all of our races.\u201d\n\nOn his Truth Social platform this week, Trump suggested that Democrats are pushing to give noncitizen migrants the right to vote and urged Republicans to pass the legislation \u2014 the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act \u2014 or \u201cgo home and cry yourself to sleep.\u201d\n\nThe fixation on noncitizen voting is part of a broader and long-term Trump campaign strategy of casting doubt on the validity of an election should he lose, and he has consistently pushed that narrative during his campaign rallies this year. Last month in Las Vegas, he told supporters, \u201cThe only way they can beat us is to cheat.\u201d It also is part of a wider Republican campaign strategy, with GOP lawmakers across the country passing state legislation and putting noncitizen voting measures on state ballots for November.\n\nDemocrats and voting rights advocates have said the legislation is unnecessary because it\u2019s already a felony for noncitizens to register to vote in federal elections, punishable by fines, prison or deportation. Anyone registering must attest under penalty of perjury that they are a U.S. citizen. Noncitizens also are not allowed to cast ballots at the state level. A handful of municipalities allow them to vote in some local elections.\n\nThey also have pointed to surveys showing that millions of Americans don\u2019t have easy access to up-to-date documentary proof of citizenship, such as a birth certificate, naturalization certificate or passport, and therefore the bill could inhibit U.S. citizen voters who aren\u2019t able to further prove their status.\n\nDuring the Wednesday floor debate, Rep. Joe Morelle of New York, the top Democrat on the House Administration Committee, expressed concern that the bill would disenfranchise various American citizens.\n\nHe mentioned military members stationed abroad who couldn\u2019t show documentary proof of citizenship in person at an election office, as well as married women whose names have changed, Native Americans whose tribal IDs don\u2019t show their place of birth and natural disaster survivors who have lost their personal documents.\n\nMorelle said he doesn\u2019t see the bill as an attempt to maintain voter rolls, but as part of larger GOP-led plans to question the validity of the upcoming election.\n\n\u201cThe false claim that there is a conspiracy to register noncitizens is a pretext for trying to overturn the 2024 election, potentially leading to another tragedy on January 6th, 2025,\u201d he said.\n\nYet Republicans who support the bill say the unprecedented surge of migrants illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border creates too large a risk of noncitizens slipping through the cracks. They could purposely or inadvertently break the law to cast ballots that sway races amid narrow margins in November\u2019s elections.\n\n\u201cEvery illegal vote cancels out the vote of a legal American citizen,\u201d said Rep. Bryan Steil of Wisconsin, the Republican chair of the House Administration Committee.\n\nIf passed, the bill would require noncitizens to be removed from state voter rolls and require new applicants to provide documentary proof of U.S. citizenship. It also would require states to establish a process for applicants who can\u2019t show proof to provide other evidence beyond their attestation of citizenship, though it\u2019s unclear what that evidence could include.\n\nOhio Secretary of State Frank LaRose recently found 137 suspected noncitizens on the state\u2019s rolls \u2014 out of roughly 8 million voters \u2014 and said he was taking action to confirm and remove them.\n\nIn 2022, Georgia\u2019s Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, conducted an audit of his state\u2019s voter rolls specifically looking for noncitizens. His office found that 1,634 had attempted to register to vote over a period of 25 years, but election officials had caught all the applications and none had been able to register.\n\nIn North Carolina in 2016, an audit of elections found that 41 legal immigrants who had not yet become citizens cast ballots, out of 4.8 million total ballots cast. The votes didn\u2019t make a difference in any of the state\u2019s elections.\n\nIn a document supporting the bill, Johnson listed other examples of noncitizens who had been removed from the rolls in Boston and Virginia. The elections departments there didn\u2019t immediately answer questions from The Associated Press to verify the claims.\n\nSeveral secretaries of state, interviewed during their summer conference in Puerto Rico this week, said noncitizens attempting to register and vote is not a big problem in their state.\n\nKentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams, a Republican, said that his state already requires photo ID to vote and that most people use a driver\u2019s license.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really have a problem with this in my state,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\nUtah Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson, a Republican who oversees elections, said she supports the legislation in concept but provided a cautionary tale about how aggressively culling voter rolls can sometimes result in the removal of qualified voters. A few years ago, everyone in her household received mail ballots for a municipal election, except her. She had been removed from the rolls because she had been born in the Netherlands, where her father was stationed with the U.S. Air Force.\n\n\u201cI was the lieutenant governor, I was overseeing elections, and I got taken off because I was born in the Netherlands,\u201d she said, \u201cSo I think we definitely have those checks and balances in the state of Utah, maybe to an extreme.\u201d\n\nThe House vote comes days after the Republican National Committee released its party platform, which emphasizes border security issues and takes a stand against Democrats giving \u201cvoting rights\u201d to migrants living in the country illegally.\n\nRepublicans are expected to shine a light on their immigration and election integrity concerns at the Republican National Convention next week in Milwaukee, where Trump is scheduled to accept his third straight nomination for president.\n\nSwenson reported from New York.

        "text": "Most consumers lack familiarity with U.S. farm bill now under consideration\nBill contains provisions that receive bipartisan public support\n\nIn the latest Consumer Food Insights Report, Joseph Balagtas, professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University and director of the Center for Food Demand Analysis and Sustainability, looked closer at consumers\u2019 familiarity with and attitudes toward the U.S. farm bill. (Purdue Agricultural Communications photo/Kate Jacobson)\n\nWEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. \u2014 The general public has limited knowledge of the U.S. farm bill that politicians are debating on Capitol Hill, according to the June 2024 Consumer Food Insights (CFI) Report.\n\nThe survey-based report out of Purdue University\u2019s Center for Food Demand Analysis and Sustainability (CFDAS) assesses food spending, consumer satisfaction and values, support of agricultural and food policies, and trust in information sources. Purdue experts conducted and evaluated the survey, which included 1,200 consumers across the U.S.\n\n\u201cAround one-third of American adults have never heard of the bill, while a similar proportion has heard of the bill but do not know what programs it supports,\u201d said the report\u2019s lead author, Joseph Balagtas, professor of agricultural economics at Purdue and director of CFDAS. \u201cThe farm bill encompasses hundreds of millions of dollars and touches every part of the food system.\u201d\n\nNew survey questions last month explored consumer attitudes toward the farm bill, which the CFI team broke down by self-reported political ideology: liberal, moderate or conservative. The survey asked respondents to rank six broad policy areas aligned with the CFI\u2019s sustainable food purchasing (SFP) index subindicators in order from most to least prioritized.\n\nHow familiar are American adults with the U.S. farm bill, and what do they want it to prioritize?\n\nConsumer familiarity with the farm bill. Consumer Food Insights, June 2024. Source: Center for Food Demand Analysis and Sustainability.\n\nThe results reveal some similarities and some differences between what consumers want in the farm bill and what they value in their own food consumption.\n\n\u201cOur data show that consumers consistently rank taste, affordability and nutrition as the most important values when they shop for groceries. When we asked them to rank their priorities for the farm bill, affordability/economic sustainability and nutrition ranked high, as well,\u201d Balagtas said. \u201cBut taste was not a consumer priority for the farm bill. And while consumers do not rank environmental sustainability as an important value for their own food shopping, they do rank it highly as a priority for the farm bill.\u201d\n\nConsumers may hold certain beliefs, like that the climate and the environment are important to address at the policy level, he said. But their individual purchasing behavior might not reflect the same sentiment as their decisions that are guided more by taste and affordability.\n\nTwo key components of the farm bill \u2014 farm subsidies and government spending on food and nutrition assistance \u2014 are heavily debated topics in the political world. Even so, most American adults (about 70%) support both farm subsidies (which include reduced crop insurance premiums, price support and conservation incentives) and food and nutrition assistance spending such as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits.\n\n\u201cWhen breaking down the results by self-identified political ideology, we see that support is bipartisan,\u201d Balagtas said. \u201cThe majority of liberals, moderates and conservatives are in support of both farm subsidies and federal nutrition assistance.\u201d\n\nIn the previous month, there were no major changes in food spending and inflation expectations or estimates. When sorting inflation expectations and estimates by political ideology from June 2022 to June 2024, however, differences arise.\n\nDo American consumers support farmer subsidies?\n\nConsumer support for government spending on farmer subsidies. Consumer Food Insights, June 2024. Source: Center for Food Demand Analysis and Sustainability.\n\nDespite a downward trend in the consumer inflation estimates and expectations over time, those with liberal views have been more likely to estimate and predict a lower level of food inflation than moderate and conservative consumers. In June 2024, conservative consumers estimated that food prices had gone up almost twice as much as what liberal consumers estimate.\n\n\u201cGiven that inflation is a common talking point in political discussions and can be a polarizing issue, it will be worth revisiting inflation expectations and monitoring food prices in the months after the upcoming 2024 U.S. presidential election,\u201d said Elijah Bryant, a survey research analyst at CFDAS and one of the co-authors of the report. \u201cThis may provide further insight into whether political leanings influence these estimates.\u201d\n\nFood insecurity rose slightly to 13% in June. The reported rate of SNAP has been higher on average among liberals (20%) compared to moderates (17%) and conservatives (13%), according to the last 30 months of data.\n\n\u201cThe correlation between SNAP use and political leanings is in line with the degree of support these three groups show for government spending on food and nutrition assistance,\u201d Bryant said.\n\nDo American consumers support government spending on food and nutrition assistance?\n\nConsumer support for government spending on food and nutrition assistance. Consumer Food Insights, June 2024. Source: Center for Food Demand Analysis and Sustainability.\n\nThe SFP index rose two points, to 72, from March 2024. Americans continue to score higher for taste, economics and security sustainability, and relatively low on social and environmental sustainability.\n\n\u201cWe see some differences in food sustainability scores across political affiliations,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cLiberals on average have higher SFP scores than moderates and conservatives, driven largely by higher scores in environmental, social and nutritional sustainability.\u201d\n\nEating a vegetarian or vegan diet is more common among liberal consumers. The rate of vegetarianism or veganism among this group is around twice as high as it is among moderate and conservative consumers.\n\nLiberal consumers also report choosing unconventional food items more often than moderate and conservative consumers. Such items include cage-free eggs, plant-based proteins and organic foods.\n\n\u201cHowever, when it comes to recycling and reducing waste, we see similarities among consumers of all political views,\u201d Bryant said.\n\n\u201cUnderstandably, we see some differences in what consumers believe about the food system based on their political leanings,\u201d Bryant said. This especially applies to the level of agreement with statements about the link between the food system and the environment.\n\nA majority of liberal consumers believe eating less meat is better for the environment (70%) compared to only 31% of conservative consumers. Similarly, 71% of liberals think agriculture is a significant contributor to climate change relative to 29% of conservatives.\n\n\u201cHowever, most consumers agree that local food is better for the environment, regardless of political leanings,\u201d Bryant said.\n\nThe Center for Food Demand Analysis and Sustainability is part of Purdue\u2019s Next Moves in agriculture and food systems and uses innovative data analysis shared through user-friendly platforms to improve the food system. In addition to the Consumer Food Insights Report, the center offers a portfolio of online dashboards.\n\nAbout Purdue University\n\nPurdue University is a public research institution demonstrating excellence at scale.

Meanwhile, the laser-focus on Biden\u2019s fitness has created a perception of chaos and uncertainty in Washington that Moscow and Beijing could not be happier about.\n\nThe World This Week A weekly digest of the latest from CFR on the biggest foreign policy stories of the week, featuring briefs, opinions, and explainers.

The U.S. presidential election is not just a domestic affair. Biden\u2019s decision will have major consequences for U.S. foreign policy and global security.\n\nIf Biden leaves the race, it will inevitably raise questions about whether he is fit to serve the remainder of his term. Dropping out would render him a lame duck at home and on the international stage. It could also embolden adversaries to test the strength of America\u2019s resolve. That could mean another round of Iranian-backed Houthi rebel attacks on global shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden; a Russian escalation in Ukraine; an expanding threat from North Korea\u2019s nuclear arsenal and its arms trade with Russia; or Chinese provocations towards Taiwan or the Philippines. A U.S. president perceived as unable to do his job leaves the West without a steersman in dangerous times.\n\nIf Biden drops out, it will set off a messy succession process in the Democratic Party. The United States will be more consumed by party politics than if the race remains between Biden and Donald Trump. There has never been a case of a presumptive nominee dropping out so late in the game, and if Washington policymakers are consumed by a succession race, they won\u2019t have bandwidth to address international crises that may erupt in the run-up to November.\n\nAmong U.S. treaty allies in NATO, Japan, and South Korea, Biden\u2019s leaving the race would raise anxiety to entirely new levels. Biden has been a stable, reliable U.S. partner after the chaotic, unpredictable Trump presidency. Many allies have pinned their hopes on Biden\u2019s mantle of continuity with post-Cold War American foreign policy\u2014better the elderly president you know than the younger candidate you don\u2019t. In a world of increasing disorder, instability in the United States is not what allies want. But it is exactly what adversaries hope for.\n\nThere is a possibility, of course, that a younger, more forceful Democratic Party candidate could revive an image of strength and vitality, perhaps even turn the election around for the Democrats and burnish the U.S. image abroad as Barack Obama did in 2008, reassuring allies tired of George W. Bush\u2019s \u201cwith us or against us\u201d American unilateralism. John F. Kennedy, too, was young and relatively inexperienced, yet he arguably handled the Cuban Missile Crisis better than some of his more seasoned advisors might have.\n\nA compelling new Democratic candidate could also strengthen the image of American democracy worldwide. Selecting a new nominee would demonstrate that one of the oldest democracies in the world is a transparent system in which elites are responsive to the concerns of the population and an elected leader can be challenged publicly and by his party, unlike autocrats Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping. It is this principle of accountability that continues to make the democracy of the United States an attractive model around the world, despite its current polarization.\n\nBut everything would have to come together perfectly to make the best-case scenario possible: a dignified withdrawal of Biden, an orderly succession to another candidate who would be a strong and powerful Democratic Party challenger to Trump.\n\nIn reality, the likelihood of chaos and instability is probably higher at this late point in the race. For U.S. foreign policy and global security, the risk of Biden dropping out might outweigh the rewards\u2014as long as American friends and foes are convinced that he can still perform the toughest job in the world.",

Share Share Copy Link copied\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nX\n\nReddit\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nFlipboard\n\nPrint Read More\n\nOutgoing NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said he\u2019s not concerned about American commitment to the alliance if Trump is returned to the White House.\n\n\u201cThe United States is safer and stronger with NATO, and that\u2019s why I expect it to remain in NATO,\u201d he said, noting longstanding support for the alliance from former presidential administrations, particularly after it invoked its Article 5 mutual defense pact to support the U.S. following the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n\nHe noted that bipartisan support for NATO among U.S. lawmakers remains strong, including among Republicans who are backing Trump. But even when it comes to Trump\u2019s own complaints about NATO, Stoltenberg says those have been addressed.\n\nTrump has repeatedly questioned NATO\u2019s relevance, suggested that he might withdraw from the alliance or, short of that, has threatened not to defend allies who do not meet the 2% defense spending commitments. Twenty-three of the 32 allies now meet their pledge to spend at least 2% of their GDP on defense and most of the rest have plans to do so in the near future, he said.\n\n\u201cThe United States has been understood,\u201d Stoltenberg said. \u201cAllies have acted.\u201d",

        "text": "Opinion | George Clooney: I Love Joe Biden. But We Need a New Nominee.\nI\u2019m a lifelong Democrat; I make no apologies for that. I\u2019m proud of what my party represents and what it stands for. As part of my participation in the democratic process and in support of my chosen candidate, I have led some of the biggest fund-raisers in my party\u2019s history. Barack Obama in 2012. Hillary Clinton in 2016. Joe Biden in 2020. Last month I co-hosted the single largest fund-raiser supporting any Democratic candidate ever, for President Biden\u2019s re-election. I say all of this only to express how much I believe in this process and how profound I think this moment is.\n\nI love Joe Biden. As a senator. As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him. Believe in his character. Believe in his morals. In the last four years, he\u2019s won many of the battles he\u2019s faced.\n\nBut the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time. None of us can. It\u2019s devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe \u201cbig F-ing deal\u201d Biden of 2010. He wasn\u2019t even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\n\nWas he tired? Yes. A cold? Maybe. But our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn\u2019t see what we just saw. We\u2019re all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we\u2019ve opted to ignore every warning sign. The George Stephanopoulos interview only reinforced what we saw the week before. As Democrats, we collectively hold our breath or turn down the volume whenever we see the president, whom we respect, walk off Air Force One or walk back to a mic to answer an unscripted question.",

        "text": "Russia favours Trump win in 2024 election race, says US intelligence\nUS intelligence assessments found Russia tried to influence campaigns to help Trump win in 2016, and again in failed 2020 race against Joe Biden.\n\nRussia again favours Republican Donald Trump as its preferred candidate to win the US presidential election this year, a US intelligence official has said.\n\nThe official, briefing reporters on US election security, was careful not to name the former president and presumptive Republican nominee when asked who Moscow wants to see as the next US president.\n\nBut he indicated that Russia favoured Trump, adding that the US intelligence community had not changed its assessments of Moscow\u2019s preference from previous elections.\n\n\u201cWe have not observed a shift in Russia\u2019s preferences for the presidential race from past elections, given the role the US is playing with regard to Ukraine and broader policy toward Russia,\u201d the official from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) said on Tuesday.\n\nPrevious assessments found that Moscow had tried, through influence campaigns, to help Trump win in 2016 against Hillary Clinton and in the 2020 campaign which he lost to current US President Joe Biden.\n\nRussia\u2019s influence operations\n\nSo far the US has not detected plans by any country to \u201cdegrade or disrupt\u201d the country\u2019s ability to hold the presidential elections in November, officials said at the briefing attended by the ODNI, FBI, and the National Coordinator for Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience \u2013 an agency that conducts cyber-defence for the US government and private industry.\n\nBut Russia, the ODNI official said, continues through social media and other means to try to influence specific groups of US voters in battleground states by promoting \u201cdivisive narratives and denigrate specific politicians\u201d, whom he did not name.\n\n\u201cRussia is undertaking a whole of government approach to influence the election, including the presidential, Congress and public opinion,\u201d he said.\n\nMoscow \u201cdetermines which candidates they\u2019re willing to support or oppose largely based on their stance toward further US aid to Ukraine and related issues,\u201d said the official.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all the tactics we\u2019ve seen before, primarily through social media efforts\u201d and \u201cusing US voices to amplify their narratives\u201d, the official added.\n\nThe Trump election campaign responded to the assessment of Russian support saying Biden was weak on Russia, as evidenced by Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWhen President Trump was in the Oval Office, Russia and all of America\u2019s adversaries were deterred, because they feared how the United States would respond,\u201d Karoline Leavitt, the Trump campaign\u2019s press secretary, said in a statement.\n\nThe Russian embassy did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nTrump has frequently criticised the scale of US military support for Ukraine, which stands at some $60bn since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in 2022. He has also called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy \u201cthe greatest salesman ever\u201d.\n\nTwo of Trump\u2019s national security advisers have presented plans to end US military support to Ukraine unless Kyiv opens talks with Russia to end the war.",

        "text": "House GOP passes bill targeting noncitizen voting - already illegal in federal elections - in Trump-aligned push\nCNN \u2014\n\nHouse Republicans passed a bill on Wednesday that would require documentary proof of US citizenship to register to vote in federal elections, despite the fact that it is already illegal for noncitizens to vote in federal elections \u2013 a move that comes as former President Donald Trump and his allies continue to sow doubts over election integrity in the run-up to the 2024 elections.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson has been outspoken in support of the legislation and Trump has called for its passage. But critics say the push to require documents proving citizenship to vote could wrongfully disenfranchise citizens if they lack access to the types of documents that meet the requirement.\n\nIt\u2019s illegal for people who aren\u2019t US citizens to vote in federal contests, and experts say it rarely happens, given that violators face imprisonment and deportation. Opponents also warn the GOP focus on noncitizen voting could serve as a way to undermine the results of the 2024 presidential election if Republicans do not win the White House.\n\nThe bill is not expected to be taken up by the Democratic-controlled Senate and the Biden administration has said that it \u201cstrongly opposes\u201d the measure.\n\nIn addition to requiring documentary proof of citizenship for voter registration in federal elections, the bill also includes provisions for removing noncitizens from federal voter registration rolls.\n\nThe vote is part of a broader push by Trump allies and comes after Trump and Johnson raised concerns about the integrity of US elections in a joint appearance at Mar-a-Lago in April that featured false claims about voting and immigration.\n\nAt that event, Johnson raised baseless concerns about \u201cpotentially hundreds of thousands of votes\u201d being cast by undocumented immigrants in the November presidential election.\n\nOn Wednesday, Johnson said in a House floor speech ahead of the vote, \u201cWould we prefer to wait for fraud to happen and only do something after elections are finalized? No, we have to catch the fraud on the front end so there\u2019s no question about the integrity of our votes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere should be no objection to this legislation at all,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump said in a post on Truth Social on Tuesday that Republicans must pass the bill, writing, \u201cOur whole voting system is under siege.\u201d\n\nThe Biden administration has denounced the bill, saying in a statement earlier this week, \u201cThe alleged justification for this bill is based on easily disproven falsehoods. \u2026 States already have effective safeguards in place to verify voters\u2019 eligibility and maintain the accuracy of voter rolls. This bill would do nothing to safeguard our elections, but it would make it much harder for all eligible Americans to register to vote and increase the risk that eligible voters are purged from voter rolls.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Fredreka Schouten and Tierney Sneed contributed to this report.",

        "text": "U.S. House passes bill requiring proof of citizenship to vote in federal races \u2022 Missouri Independent\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill Wednesday that would require individuals registering to vote to provide proof of citizenship to participate in federal elections.\n\nThe legislation, passed 221-198, would also require states to check their voter rolls for registered noncitizens.\n\nThe Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, or SAVE, is intended to prevent noncitizens from voting. That act is already illegal, since under current U.S. law, only citizens can vote in federal elections, but the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 prohibits states from confirming citizenship status.\n\nVoting laws vary by state, with some states like Georgia and Wisconsin requiring photo identification and others, such as Pennsylvania and New Mexico, requiring no documentation at all.\n\nStates that do mandate photo identification or other documents use driver\u2019s licenses, military ID cards, student ID cards, birth certificates, tribal ID cards, or even a recent utility bill.\n\nThe SAVE Act, introduced by GOP Rep. Chip Roy of Texas in May, would require most individuals to have a passport to register to vote.\n\nOnly about 48% of U.S. citizens have a passport, according to State Department data. Driver\u2019s license and tribal ID cards typically do not prove a person\u2019s citizenship and couldn\u2019t be used to register under the SAVE Act.\n\nData also indicates that noncitizen voting is not a prevalent issue, as many House Republicans have said.\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, states such as North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, California, and Texas reviewed their voter rolls between 2016 and 2022. These audits found that fewer than 50 noncitizens in each state had voted in recent elections, out of upwards of 23 million total votes per state.\n\nThe measure is unlikely to advance in the Democratic-controlled Senate.\n\nPartisan divide\n\nHouse Republicans have stood staunchly in favor of Roy\u2019s bill, H.R.8281.\n\nOn the House floor Wednesday, Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, urged his colleagues to pass the bill, saying it was \u201cone of the most important votes that members of this chamber will ever take in their entire careers.\u201d\n\nLast month, Johnson\u2019s office released a 22-page report asserting the SAVE Act was critical for American election integrity.\n\nJohnson blamed the Democratic Party for keeping American \u201cborders wide open to every country on the planet,\u201d and claimed Democrats \u201cwant illegal aliens voting in our elections.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, the Biden administration issued a Statement of Administration Policy against the legislation, saying there is no cause for concern about noncitizen voting and that it would only hinder the voting rights of eligible Americans.\n\nRep. Joe Morelle of New York, the top Democrat on the House Administration Committee, urged his House colleagues during Wednesday floor debate to vote no on the bill, saying it would be devastating for all American voters.\n\n\u201cThis bill is about scaring Americans, this bill is about silencing Americans, this bill is about disenfranchising Americans,\u201d he said. \u201cThis bill is about further damaging the foundations of our democracy.\u201d\n\nBut House Administration Committee Chairman Bryan Steil backed the legislation during a Rules Committee hearing.\n\n\u201cIn the past few decades, Americans\u2019 faith in the integrity of our elections has eroded and it is Congress\u2019 responsibility to restore confidence in our election system,\u201d said Steil, a Wisconsin Republican. \u201cThe SAVE Act would do just that.\u201d\n\nRepublican Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana in a Monday press conference called the bill \u201ca safeguard to ensure that only American citizens vote in America\u2019s elections.\u201d\n\nElection implications\n\nDemocratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York during Wednesday floor debate alluded to the broader implications of the SAVE Act, looking towards the November election and the possibility of a second term for President Joe Biden.\n\nHe said Republicans could use the bill \u201cas a cover, already trying to set up an excuse for what may happen in November.\u201d\n\nVoting rights advocates have expressed concern over the SAVE Act, saying it contains many falsehoods and conspiracy theories that perpetuate extreme views.\n\nAt a Tuesday press conference hosted by America\u2019s Voice, an immigrant advocacy nonprofit, Sean Morales-Doyle from the Brennan Center for Justice said the bill plays into greater themes of racism and xenophobia.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also a very damaging lie with an ulterior motive: to lay the groundwork for challenging legitimate election results down the road,\u201d he said.\n\nOne House member equated the bill to a \u201cJim Crow poll tax\u201d during floor debate. Jennifer McClellan, a Virginia Democrat, said she \u201cis not aware of any single proof of citizenship document that doesn\u2019t cost an individual money to get it.\u201d\n\nWesley Hunt, a Republican from Texas, responded that \u201cJim Crow is over.\u201d",

        "text": "Gavin Newsom for president? Tallying up his assets and liabilities\n\ud83d\udcaa NEWSOM ASSETS\n\n1. He\u2019s a dynamic campaigner\n\nNewsom\u2019s classic good looks and charisma have always bolstered his political star power. (Never forget the infamous \u201cNew Kennedys\u201d profile in Harper\u2019s Bazaar in 2004, shortly after he became mayor of San Francisco.) But several observers said they were particularly impressed by how he has navigated a tough situation as a Biden surrogate over the past two weeks, defending the president on television immediately after the debate and then rallying Democratic crowds on the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt him by saying this, but he\u2019s a natural politician,\u201d said Bob Shrum, director of the USC Dornsife Center for the Political Future and an adviser on numerous presidential campaigns, including Democratic nominees Al Gore in 2000 and John Kerry in 2004.\n\nNewsom\u2019s defense of the Democratic position \u2014 even in direct confrontation with conservative opponents and sometimes out ahead of his own party \u2014 gives him the image of a fighter, which could appeal to liberal voters looking for a new leader.\n\n\u201cThe reason Gavin gets talked about is how dynamic he is, how polished he is in terms of talking about politics and policy,\u201d said Roger Salazar, a Democratic communications consultant who served as a spokesperson on Gore\u2019s 2000 campaign and is a Newsom appointee to a California commission for off-road vehicle recreation. \u201cHe\u2019s very strong on the stump and he doesn\u2019t back down.\u201d\n\nIt also carries potential benefits behind the scenes, ingratiating Newsom to the Democratic establishment that could clear a path for his future plans.\n\n\u201cBeing the loyal lieutenant and not appearing too ambitious will serve him to maybe buy some goodwill and become a legitimate heir apparent,\u201d said Jason Cabel Roe, a longtime GOP strategist in Michigan and former deputy campaign manager for Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential bid in 2007.\n\n2. He has a growing national fundraising base\n\nNewsom is a prolific fundraiser with experience building a war chest to boost himself and other Democrats nationally. It is one of his greatest strengths, rivaling any senator or governor who may be considering their own campaign for president, said Rose Kapolczynski, a longtime Democratic strategist working with Close the Gap California to elect more women legislators.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s raised tens of millions of dollars for his own campaigns and ballot measures. He\u2019s been an effective fundraising surrogate for Biden and others. And that\u2019s given him the opportunity to build a national fundraising network,\u201d Kapolczynski said. \u201cHe has a strong small donor network and he\u2019s certainly well-known to major donors across the country.\u201d\n\nNewsom\u2019s three federal committees, branded as the Campaign for Democracy, have raised $24 million for direct contributions to candidates, ad spending and more since launching in March last year, according to data from the Federal Elections Committee. Slightly more than half of that was transferred from his 2022 gubernatorial campaign.\n\n\u201cThe more that Republicans say California is a liberal hellhole, that helps him. He wants that.\u201d Mike Madrid, Republican political consultant\n\nMost of the cash comes from donors in California, the wealthiest state in the nation and the beating heart of its lucrative tech and entertainment industries, a CalMatters analysis found. But Newsom \u2014 who regularly travels the country to elevate Democrats in red states \u2014 has also expanded his reach from coast to coast.\n\nFor example, the Campaign for Democracy PAC, Newsom\u2019s political action committee contributing to Democratic parties and candidates, raised more than $10 million by March, about $6 million of which came from his gubernatorial account. An analysis of itemized contributions from donors who gave $200 or more suggests that more than 40% of the remaining funds came from outside California, across 46 other states.\n\nEstablishing the network now also shrewdly lays the groundwork for a potential future presidential campaign, giving Newsom a financial reserve to run ads and curry favor with other Democrats, said Bud Jackson, a longtime Democratic strategist in Washington, D.C., who spearheaded TV advertising efforts to recruit Wesley Clark and Barack Obama for president.\n\n\u201cIt sounds like they\u2019ve got their shit together,\u201d Jackson said.\n\n3. He\u2019s appealing to Democratic base voters\n\nIf Biden sticks around, the next Democratic presidential nominee will be chosen through the 2028 primaries. Those are decided by a more liberal subset of the electorate that may be drawn to a candidate like Newsom with a history of bold progressive governance \u2014 from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples as mayor of San Francisco in 2004 to declaring a moratorium on executions in California not long after he entered the governor\u2019s office in 2019.\n\nRather than the pocketbook appeal to the working class that propelled Bill Clinton, Democratic voters in the Trump era are searching for a leader with the proper worldview, said Mike Madrid, a Republican political consultant who worked on the anti-Trump Lincoln Project during the 2020 presidential campaign. Madrid believes Newsom is the frontrunner for the 2028 nomination because he has shown Democrats how to win with the cultural issues, such as abortion rights, that are most important to the party\u2019s core supporters.\n\n\u201cHe understands the Democratic base better than almost any Democrat of his generation, and that they are driven almost exclusively by cultural issues,\u201d said Madrid, who worked on the campaign for one of Newsom\u2019s gubernatorial rivals in 2018. \u201cI think he\u2019s a generational talent.\u201d\n\nAnd while candidates generally try to broaden their message during the general election, Madrid said the calculus for how to win has changed. In an increasingly divided electorate, where miniscule margins will decide the presidential race, energizing the base is just as important as winning over the ever-narrower slice of swing voters.\n\nThe constant attacks against Newsom and his \u201cCalifornia values\u201d by Trump, DeSantis and other Republicans actually benefit Newsom with the people who hate what those conservative politicians stand for, Madrid said.\n\n\u201cThe average Democratic voter across the country is not that different from the average California Democratic voter,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more that Republicans say California is a liberal hellhole, that helps him. He wants that.\u201d",

        "text": "2024 Asian American Voter Survey\nBackground\n\nThe 2018 and 2020 elections saw record increases in voter turnout among Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs). In 2020, Asian Americans saw a significant double-digit increase in presidential turnout (11 points) and also had the highest midterm turnout gain in 2018, a 14-point increase. In 2020, almost 60% (7.6 million) of the Asian American citizen age voting population turned out. In battleground states such as Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, the number of Asian Americans who cast their ballot in 2020 exceeded the presidential margin of victory.\n\n\n\nIn the past two decades, Asian Americans have also become one of the fastest-growing racial or ethnic groups in the United States. Between 2010 and 2020, the Asian population in the United States grew by 39%, and their population is projected to pass 35 million by 2060.\n\nRead more about the survey methodology at the bottom of this page here.\n\nKey Findings\n\nVoter Intent, Outreach, and Party Identification\n\n90% of Asian American registered voters say they plan to vote for President, Congress and other offices this November (compared to 93% in 2020 and 94% in 2016). Over two-thirds (68%) say they are absolutely certain they will vote this year.\n\nA smaller percent of young voters age 18-34 indicate they are planning to vote (85%) compared to older voters, with only 62% saying they are absolutely certain they will vote in November.\n\nNearly half of Asian American voters (46%) prefer voting by mail or dropping their ballot off, instead of voting in-person.\n\n42% of Asian American voters say they have not been contacted by either of the two major political parties this election season, including half (50%) who say they have not been contacted by the Democratic Party and 57% indicating not being contacted by the Republican Party.\n\n42% of Asian American voters identify as Democrats (compared to 44% in 2020), 22% identify as Republicans (compared to 23% in 2020) and 31% identify as Independent (compared to 25% in 2020)\n\nPresidential Favorability\n\nOver half of Asian American voters (51%) view Joe Biden \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d favorably while just over one-third (34%) say the same for Donald Trump. 43% say they have a \u201cvery\u201d unfavorable impression of Trump compared to under one-fourth (23%) who view Biden the same.\n\nIf the election were being held today, nearly half of Asian American voters (46%) say they would be inclined to vote for Joe Biden, versus 31% who are inclined to vote for Donald Trump. Nearly one in four (23%) would either vote for a third party candidate, are undecided or refused to answer.\n\nIn 2020, over half of Asian American voters (54%) intended to vote for Joe Biden, illustrating an 8 percentage point or 8.5% decrease since the last presidential election year.\n\nRegarding upcoming elections for the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, half of Asian American voters would vote for a Democratic candidate (50% and 51%, respectively) if the election were being held today \u2014 and 30% would vote for a Republican candidate.\n\nPolicy Priorities\n\nAsian American voters ranked jobs and the economy (86%), inflation (85%), healthcare (85%), crime (80%), education (80%), Social Security and Medicare (79%), and the cost of housing (78%) as issues that are \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d important in personally deciding how to vote in November. National security, gun control and immigration were also highly important issues.\n\nAsian American voters believe that the Democratic Party is doing a better job on issues of: abortion and reproductive rights (49% vs. 19%), healthcare (46% vs. 19%), racism (44% vs. 16%) and gun control (43% vs. 23%) as compared to the Republican Party. Conversely, Asian American voters believe the Republican Party is doing a better job on issues of: national security (36% vs. 28%), immigration (35% vs. 33%), inflation (33% vs. 28%), and crime (31% vs. 28%).\n\nWhen asked what issues would be enough to get them to the polls in November, regardless of how they feel about any particular candidate, Asian American voters indicated the following issues: jobs and the economy (84%), inflation (82%), healthcare (81%), Social Security and Medicare (76%), crime (74%), the cost of housing (72%), gun control (72%), national security (72%), immigration (71%), and education (71%).\n\nPolicy Views and Perspectives\n\nLanguage Access\n\n72% of Asian American voters speak a language other than English at home\n\nThree in four Asian American voters (75%) \u201cstrongly\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d agree translations and/or interpreters should be made available at the polls for voters who do not speak or read English well\n\nEducational Access\n\n84% of Asian American voters favor programs for people of color, including Asian Americans, to get better access to educational opportunities\n\n\n\nInclusive Curriculum\n\nThe vast majority of Asian American voters support the teaching of Asian American history (77%) and the history of all communities of color (74%) in public schools\n\nImmigration\n\nA two-thirds majority of Asian American voters (66%) support making it easier for immigrants to sponsor family members for visas\n\nHate Crimes, Harassment, Discrimination\n\nOver two-thirds of Asian American voters (68%) reported worrying about hate crimes, harassment, and discrimination \u201csometimes\u201d (38%), \u201csomewhat often\u201d (17%), or \u201cvery often\u201d (13%)\n\nSupport for Family Caregivers\n\nNearly one in four Asian American voters (24%) are currently providing care to an older or ill adult or someone with a disability\n\n70% of Asian American voters agree that Congress and the President should pass stronger legislation to support family caregivers\n\nSocial Security & Medicare\n\n76% of Asian American voters say Social Security and Medicare are strong enough issues to get them to the polls regardless of how they may feel about any particular candidate\n\n85% of Asian American voters agree, with 57% agreeing \u201cvery strongly, \u201dthat Congress and the President should make sure workers get the Social Security benefits they paid into\n\nGun Control\n\nOver three in four Asian American voters (77%) agree, with 53% agreeing \u201cvery strongly,\u201d that we should have stricter gun laws in the United States\n\nClimate Change\n\nOver two-thirds of Asian American voters (69%) agree that Congress and the president should pass stronger legislation to reduce the effects of climate change\n\nAbout the Asian American Voter Survey\n\nAlong with the growing presence of Asian American voters is a growing interest in the opinions and priorities of this electorate. The Asian American Voter Surveys (AAVS) are election-year surveys of registered AAPI voters, capturing the perspectives of voters and their priorities across various years. The AAVS began in 2014.\n\nAAVS 2024 Infographics Category Infographic Tag 2024 AAVS\n\nSurvey Methodology\n\nSampling\n\nFor this study, a total of 2,479 Asian Americans were surveyed. The study was conducted using mixed modes, self-administered responses via an online panel and telephone interviews of respondents selected from a classified list of Asian American voters for the six largest ethnic groups (Chinese, Indian, Filipino, Korean, Vietnamese, and Japanese). For the phone portion, 22 interviews were completed by landline, while 1,235 were completed via cell phone for a total of 1,257 surveys completed by phone. Another 1,222 surveys were completed using an online panel which was drawn from six panel partners targeting Asian American panelists. Respondents qualified for the survey if they indicated on a screener questionnaire that they were currently registered to vote at their present address.\n\nAAPI Data drew a telephone sample of individuals drawn from lists of registered voters provided by Catalist, with phone numbers and Asian ethnicity labels appended. For the purposes of this study, using registered voter lists was the most optimal strategy, both from the perspective of effectiveness as well as cost efficiency. The survey is conducted only among registered voters, and Catalist has built a strong reputation over the last decade with respect to having up-to-date voter registration records with appended information on phone numbers, as well as racial and ethnic classification based on administrative, survey, and modeled data.\n\nWeighting\n\nThe combined landline and cellphone sample is weighted to population estimates of the citizen voting age population (CVAP) of the six target Asian American groups (Chinese, Indian, Filipino, Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese) using raked weights or iterative proportional fitting. All population benchmarks were derived from the 2022 5-Year American Community Survey Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) produced by the U.S. Census Bureau with the following parameters: Ethnicity (row variable) by State of Residence, Age brackets (18 to 34, 35 to 49, 50 to 64, 65 and older), Gender, Educational attainment (Less than High School, High School, College, Postgraduate), and Nativity (Naturalized or Native Born) as tabulated from the ACS PUMS file. We also weighted for party distribution of registered voters by Asian ethnicity based on the party registration of respondents as revealed in administrative records on the phone file.",

        "text": "72% of Americans say the U.S. used to be a good example of democracy, but isn\u2019t anymore\nAhead of the November presidential election, just 19% of Americans say democracy in the United States is a good example for other countries to follow, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in April.\n\nThe most common view \u2013 held by 72% of Americans \u2013 is that democracy in the U.S. used to be a good example, but has not been in recent years. Another 8% of Americans say U.S. democracy has never been a good example for other countries to follow.\n\nAmericans are much more likely than people in other countries to say U.S. democracy used to be a good example. A median of 40% of adults across 34 other countries surveyed in 2024 take this view.\n\nHow we did this This Pew Research Center analysis examines views of American democracy among people in the United States and in 34 other countries we surveyed this year. For non-U.S. data, this analysis draws on nationally representative surveys of 40,566 adults conducted from Jan. 5 to May 21, 2024. All surveys were conducted over the phone with adults in Canada, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Surveys were conducted face-to-face in Argentina, Bangladesh, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ghana, Hungary, India, Israel, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Tunisia and Turkey. In Australia, we used a mixed-mode probability-based online panel. In the United States, we surveyed 3,600 adults from April 1 to April 7, 2024. Everyone who took part is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology. For more information on how people in 34 other countries view democracy in the United States, refer to our June report: \u201cGlobally, Biden Receives Higher Ratings Than Trump.\u201d Here is the question used for this analysis, along with responses, and its methodology.\n\nAmericans\u2019 views differ by age, party and voter status\n\nRelatively few Americans overall see the nation\u2019s democracy as a good example for other countries to follow. But adults ages 50 and older are more likely than those under 50 to hold this view. Younger adults, on the other hand, are more likely than older adults to say American democracy has never been a good example (11% vs. 4%).\n\nDemocrats and Democratic-leaning independents are somewhat more likely than Republicans and Republican leaners to see U.S. democracy as a good example (22% vs. 17%). This is nearly the reverse of where things stood in February 2021, when 24% of Republicans and 16% of Democrats saw democracy in the U.S. as a good example.\n\nOpinions also differ by voter status. Among Americans who are registered to vote, 21% see U.S. democracy as a good example, compared with 13% of those who are not registered to vote. Registered voters are also somewhat more likely to answer this question.\n\nGlobally, views of American democracy differ by country\n\nAs in the U.S., the most common view across the other countries we surveyed this year is that American democracy used to be a good example for other nations to follow, but has not been in recent years. However there are big differences by country.\n\nAround two-thirds of adults in Canada (67%) and Japan (65%) say democracy in the U.S. used to be a good example. By contrast, only 12% in Bangladesh, 18% in Ghana and 19% in India hold this view, though sizable shares in Bangladesh and India do not offer an opinion.\n\nElsewhere, large shares of the public take the view that U.S. democracy has never been a good example for other countries to follow. Around half of adults in Turkey (52%) say this, as do 45% in Tunisia.\n\nAnd like in the U.S., younger people in other countries are often more likely than their elders to say American democracy has never been a good example. In Greece, for instance, 54% of adults under 35 say this, compared with 34% of those 50 and older. There are also notable age gaps in Australia, Canada, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden.\n\nThis pattern is reversed in several other countries. Older adults in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Singapore and Turkey are more likely than younger people to say American democracy has never been a good example.\n\n(Read more about global views of U.S. democracy in our June report.)\n\nNote: Here is the question used for this analysis, along with responses, and its methodology.",

        "text": "US Vice Presidents Who Went on to Become President\nThe office of vice president\u2014the second-highest position in the executive branch, and first in the constitutional line of succession\u2014might seem like a good launching pad for a politician with aspirations of attaining the nation\u2019s highest office. But relatively few vice presidents\u2014just 15 of the 49 who served between 1789 and 2021\u2014became president, and eight of those did it by taking over after the death of a president, while another, Gerald R. Ford, rose to the office when his predecessor, Richard M. Nixon, resigned. Only six vice presidents managed to get elected president on their own.\n\n\u201cVice presidents are pretty successful at gaining their party\u2019s nomination for president,\u201d says John McGlennon, a professor at William & Mary university in Virginia, where he specializes in American politics. \u201cBut they\u2019re less successful at actually winning elections.\u201d\n\nOne prominent example is Hubert Humphrey, who served as Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s vice president and was chosen as the Democratic nominee at the 1968 Democratic Convention, but then lost the presidential election that fall. Other vice presidents who managed to win Democratic nomination\u2014Walter Mondale, VP under Jimmy Carter, and Al Gore, VP under Bill Clinton\u2014also failed in 1984 and 2000, respectively (although Gore managed to win the popular vote).\n\n\u201cSometimes voters are just ready to move on,\u201d McGlennon says.\n\nThe job also creates certain hindrances to future aspirations. \u201cThe nature of being vice president is to stay in the background,\u201d explains University of Richmond political science professor Christopher Miller. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to pivot from that to taking the spotlight and convincing people you deserve it.\u201d\n\nWhich VPs stand the best chance of being elected? Possibly, the ones who wait to run, so they can position themselves as challengers rather than incumbents.\n\n\u201cIf you look at modern history, two of three VPs who became president did so after a gap between their vice presidency and presidency: Nixon and Biden,\u201d says Gayle Alberda, an associate professor of politics at Fairfield University.\n\nHere are American vice presidents who became president\u2014despite the odds.\n\n1-2. John Adams and Thomas Jefferson\n\nThough George Washington easily won the first presidential election in 1789 with 69 electoral votes, under the rules of the time, runner-up John Adams, a fellow Federalist, legislator and diplomat from Massachusetts, was named vice president. Adams then won election in his own right in 1796, with Democratic-Republican party rival Thomas Jefferson finishing second, leaving the country in the odd position of having a president and VP from different political parties. In the highly partisan, nasty election of 1800, Jefferson eventually emerged victorious.\n\n3. Martin Van Buren\n\nPhotoQuest/Getty Images\n\nA New York politician, Martin Van Buren was appointed by Andrew Jackson as his Secretary of State. Van Buren proved adept at navigating the bitter rivalries within the Jackson administration, and during Jackson\u2019s second term from 1833 to 1837, Van Buren served as his vice president. In the election of 1836, Van Buren ran as a Democrat and defeated three Whig party candidates. Van Buren would serve just one term. With the economy mired in a severe downturn in 1840, Van Buren was beaten by Whig candidate William Henry Harrison.\n\n4. John Tyler\n\nJohn Tyler\n\nA former Representative and Senator from Virginia, John Tyler was elected as vice president on the Whig Party ticket in 1840 with William Henry Harrison. After Harrison died just 32 days after his inauguration in 1841, Tyler was sworn in to replace him.\n\nIn an effort to establish an orderly transition, Tyler kept Harrison\u2019s entire cabinet, but almost all of them resigned in protest after Tyler vetoed a bill to establish the Bank of the United States. Tyler opted not to run for reelection in 1844.\n\n5. Millard Fillmore\n\nBettmann Archive/Getty Images\n\nWhen the Whigs picked Gen. Zachary Taylor, a southern enslaver, as their presidential candidate in 1848, they tried to placate the abolitionists in their ranks by adding Millard Fillmore, a northerner. Taylor and Fillmore didn\u2019t even meet until after they\u2019d won the election, and they didn\u2019t get along, which led Taylor to shut out Fillmore from any real role in his administration. But after Taylor died in office in 1850, possibly of cholera, Fillmore found himself in charge.\n\nFillmore ran for reelection in 1856, but lost, and his poor performance led to the demise of the Whigs.\n\n6. Andrew Johnson\n\nCorbis/Getty Images President Andrew Johnson\n\nThe Tennessean Andew Johnson served in the U.S. House and Senate, where he supported slavery and states\u2019 rights, but opposed southern states\u2019 secession from the Union in 1861. Abraham Lincoln chose him as his running mate in 1864, when the Republicans joined forces with some Democrats in a \u201cUnion\u201d party ticket. When Lincoln was assassinated in 1865, Johnson, who also had been marked for death by the plotters, became president.\n\nIn 1868, Johnson became the first president ever to be impeached, when the House voted 126 to 47 to put him on trial in the Senate. Johnson managed to avoid conviction by a single vote, and served out his term.\n\n7. Chester A. Arthur\n\nChester A. Arthur\n\nVermont native Chester Arthur, a school principal and lawyer by trade, had little government experience except for a stint as collector of tariffs for the port of New York, where also he routinely collected salary kickbacks from employees to support the Republican Party. Presidential candidate James Garfield picked him for regional balance for the 1880 Republican ticket. But after Garfield was fatally shot by an emotionally disturbed assassin, Charles J. Giteau, in 1881, Arthur took Garfield\u2019s place.\n\nSome feared Arthur would act like a hack machine politician, but as president he showed a willingness to reform. He did, however, sign into law the Chinese Exclusion Act, a discriminatory bill banning Chinese immigration and forbidding Chinese immigrants from becoming U.S. citizens. Arthur lost his party\u2019s nomination in 1884.\n\n8. Theodore Roosevelt\n\nTeddy Roosevelt Becomes President\n\nA physical fitness buff and Spanish-American War hero, Teddy Roosevelt developed a reputation for fierce independence as New York governor. Republican party bosses tried to neutralize him by putting him on the 1900 ticket with William McKinley, figuring that he would have little leverage to advance his progressive agenda as VP. But when McKinley was assassinated in 1901, Roosevelt suddenly was the man in charge.\n\nTo gain support from industrialists, he held back on pushing progressive and reform policies at first, but after winning reelection in a landslide in 1904, he embarked on the ambitious \u201cSquare Deal\u201d program, which regulated industry, promoted social programs to help the poor, and set aside 200 million acres of wilderness for preservation. After he left office, Roosevelt grew disenchanted with his hand-picked successor, William Howard Taft, and ran unsuccessfully against him as a third-party candidate in 1912.\n\n9. Calvin Coolidge\n\nBettmann / Contributor/Getty Images Calvin Coolidge, 30th President, sitting at his desk.\n\nVermont native Calvin Coolidge served as the lieutenant governor and governor of Massachusetts before he was selected as Warren Harding\u2019s running mate in 1920. After Harding died of a heart attack in 1923, the notoriously cool and unemotional Coolidge was sworn in by his father, a justice of the peace. He ran successfully for reelection in 1924, with the slogan \u201cKeep Cool with Coolidge.\u201d\n\nA believer in trickle-down economics, Coolidge got Congress to cut taxes for the wealthy, but he did little to curb the stock-market speculation that led to a catastrophic crash in 1929 during the subsequent Herbert Hoover administration. He chose not to run for reelection in 1928, announcing his decision with a one-sentence typewritten statement that he never explained.\n\n10. Harry S. Truman\n\nBettmann Archive/Getty Images Harry S. Truman.\n\nMissouri native Harry Truman couldn\u2019t get into West Point because of his poor eyesight, and had to work on his family\u2019s farm instead, until his National Guard unit shipped out to fight in World War I. After the war, he rose in local Missouri politics and was elected to the U.S. Senate. Near the end of World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt chose Truman as his running mate on a 1944 Democratic ticket that won easily, but Truman served less than three months as VP before Roosevelt died and Truman replaced him.\n\nDespite his humble background and lack of education, Truman turned out to be one of the most consequential presidents in U.S. history, making the decision to drop atomic bombs on Japan to end the war. An aggressive internationalist, Truman went on to confront the Soviet Union and newly-communist China in the Cold War. Though his political fortunes were battered by high inflation and consumer goods shortages, Truman managed to win reelection in 1948, in a stunning political comeback. After communist North Korea invaded South Korea in 1950, Truman rallied the U.S. to the South\u2019s defense, but the bloody stalemate that ensued hurt Truman\u2019s popularity and contributed to his decision not to run for reelection in 1952.\n\n11. Lyndon B. Johnson\n\nLyndon Johnson, a Texan who served as Senate majority leader, was chosen by John F. Kennedy as his running mate when he was elected in 1960. Even so, Johnson was not in Kennedy's inner circle and held little influence. That all changed when Kennedy was assassinated on a visit to Dallas in 1963. Johnson, who was just two cars behind Kennedy in the motorcade, escaped injury, and he was sworn in on Air Force One later that afternoon.\n\nJohnson ran for reelection in Kennedy\u2019s place in 1964, and crushed Republican Barry Goldwater, who many voters perceived as too extreme. Johnson used his mandate to make massive changes in the social safety net, engineering passage of Medicare, pumping money into education and rebuilding cities, and also pushed through civil rights bills that outlawed discrimination in voting, interstate commerce and housing. But his escalation of the U.S. war against communist rebels in Vietnam proved unpopular, and Johnson eventually chose not to run in 1968.\n\n12. Richard M. Nixon\n\nNixon Wins Presidency\n\nRichard Nixon, a Californian who served in the House and Senate and then as Dwight Eisenhower\u2019s VP from 1953-1961, was unable to build on Eisenhower\u2019s popularity, and lost a close election in 1960 to Democrat John F. Kennedy. Nevertheless, Nixon managed to rebuild his political viability, and in 1968, won a narrow victory to the presidency in a three-way race with Democrat Hubert Humphrey and segregationist Alabama Gov. George Wallace.\n\nNixon went on to win reelection in 1972 in a rout over antiwar Democrat George McGovern. Nixon had many achievements as president, from ending the military draft to founding the Environmental Protection Agency and moving to establish normal diplomatic relations with the People\u2019s Republic of China. But the Watergate scandal sunk his political fortunes, and he became the first president to resign from office.\n\n13. Gerald R. Ford\n\nCorbis/Getty Images President Gerald Ford announcing his decision to pardon Richard Nixon of any crimes he may have committed during the Watergate scandal.\n\nGerald Ford, a veteran legislator from Michigan, replaced Spiro Agnew as Richard Nixon\u2019s vice president after Agnew was forced to resign in 1973 over allegations of corruption. In the summer of 1974, Ford replaced Nixon himself, who decided to quit rather than go through impeachment and a trial in the Senate. A month later, Ford pardoned his predecessor \u201cfor all offenses against the United States for which he, Richard Nixon, has committed or may have committed.\u201d That action was unpopular, and likely contributed to Ford\u2019s narrow loss to Democrat Jimmy Carter in 1976.\n\n14. George H.W. Bush\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush. Credit: Cynthia Johnson/Liaison/Getty Images George Bush waves to a crowd of supporters November 5, 1988. (Photo by Cynthia Johnson/Liaison)\n\nIn addition to serving two terms as Ronald Reagan\u2019s VP, George H.W. Bush had an impressive resume: a World War II Navy aviator, two terms in Congress, stints as UN Ambassador, chairman of the Republican National Committee, Chief of Liaison for the People\u2019s Republic of China, and Central Intelligence Agency director. Bush easily defeated the Democratic candidate, Massachusetts Gov. Mike Dukakis, in 1988.\n\nBush oversaw the end of the Cold War and also led an international coalition that expelled Iraqi dictator from neighboring Kuwait, which he had invaded. But Bush\u2019s reelection prospects were hurt by an economic downturn and the emergence of a charismatic Democratic rival, Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, as well as pushback from the far right in his own party. In 1992, he failed to win reelection.\n\n15. Joe Biden\n\nBiden, a Delaware resident who served for decades in the U.S. Senate, ran twice unsuccessfully for president before Barack Obama selected him as running mate in 2008. Biden decided not to run for president in 2016, in part due to the cancer death of his son, Beau. However, Biden eventually put together a winning multiracial coalition and won the presidency in the subsequent 2020 election, attracting more than 81 million votes.",

        "text": "David Zaslav Declines to Endorse Biden or Trump, Says It\u2019s More Important That Next U.S. President Supports M&A Deregulation\nDavid Zaslav, chief executive officer of Warner Bros. Discovery, did not state a preference about whether President Biden or Donald Trump win the 2024 election. Instead, his bigger concern is that whoever occupies in the White House greases the skids for more entertainment industry consolidation.\n\nAt Allen & Co.\u2019s annual summer meetup for billionaires and business moguls in Sun Valley, Idaho, Zaslav on Tuesday was asked about the presidential election. Zaslav told reporters at the gathering that it was more important to him that the next president is business-friendly rather than which candidate wins, per Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cWe just need an opportunity for deregulation, so companies can consolidate and do what we need to, to be even better,\u201d he said.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nDuring the 2020 election cycle, Zaslav donated more than $240,000 to Democrats, according to a USA Today report. That included a $100,000 donation to Nancy Pelosi\u2019s reelection campaign in 2019, according to Federal Election Commission records.\n\nUnder the Biden administration, the Justice Department and the FTC have been far more aggressive in seeking to use antitrust laws to crack down on alleged anticompetitive deals and business practices than the agencies were during Trump\u2019s time in office. In May 2024, for example, the DOJ sued Live Nation and Ticketmaster, seeking to split the two apart, for allegedly abusing monopoly power to dominate the ticketing business and thwart competition.\n\nZaslav has previously said that WBD-owned CNN needed become a news network that presents \u201cboth sides\u201d of every political issue rather than being a \u201cleft-leaning\u201d \u201cadvocacy network.\u201d Last year, Zaslav defended CNN\u2019s decision to host a town hall with Donald Trump, saying that Trump, as the Republican front-runner, \u201chas to be on our network.\u201d\n\nOn the topic of M&A, Zaslav at Sun Valley also weighed in on the pact reached by Shari Redstone and Paramount Global to merge with David Ellison\u2019s Skydance Media, saying that it\u2019s \u201cgood for the industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cGetting [Paramount Global] in solid hands and having them funded \u2014 it\u2019s a great company and a great heritage, so I think that\u2019s good for the industry,\u201d Zaslav said.\n\nZaslav in late 2023 had met with Bob Bakish (then CEO of Paramount) to briefly discuss the idea of merging WBD and Paramount Global but those talks did not go anywhere.\n\nAt an investment conference this spring, Zaslav said Warner Bros. Discovery will be \u201copportunistic\u201d in seeking M&A deals in the next two or three years. \u201cThere are a lot of players that are losing a lot of money,\u201d Zaslav said May 30 at the Bernstein 40th Annual Strategic Decisions Conference. \u201cThere\u2019ll be some players that want to get out of the business, that will look to consolidate their streaming businesses with others,\u201d he said, adding that he believes there will be four or five dominant global streaming platforms as things shake out.\n\nParamount Global\u2019s trio of co-CEOs who are currently running the company ahead of the expected Skydance deal close in Q3 2025 have said they are seeking out potential joint venture partnerships for Paramount+ in order to gain economies of scale. One potential dance partner is Warner Bros. Discovery, which is open to exploring a combination of Max and Paramount+.",

        "text": "Pundits: French, British elections carry lessons for U.S.\nRecent elections in France and the United Kingdom held some surprises and \u2014 political scientists say \u2014 some lessons for the political parties in the U.S. UK voters ousted the Conservative party in favor of center-left Labour, and French voters, apparently spooked by their initial steps toward the right, voted overwhelmingly against the far-right National Party. Polls had predicted the right would win. Some analysis of the elections concluded there is a winning trend worth noting, in particular for the American Democratic Party: To swing voters left, you must sacrifice some platforms \u2014 and some candidates. We asked UC Riverside political scientists whether they see lessons from the left-prevailing elections in France and the UK. Weighing in are political scientist Shaun Bowler, emeritus political science professor Max Neiman, and polling expert Andrew Crosby.\n\nQ: Should the notion of sacrificing candidates to win more broadly ring true for American political parties? Is President Biden the sacrifice Democrats must make in order to win?\n\nBowler: If it is indeed the case that \u2014 as Biden himself says \u2014 a Trump win is going to be bad for democracy in the U.S. \u2014 then the question of who is best able to defeat Trump is a serious one to ask. Biden seems to have answered that question with \u201cme.\u201d Of course he did. Like all political leaders, Biden will exist in a bubble. We see this in Trump as well. They are surrounded by people who only tell them what they want to hear. But as you can see a lot of people outside that bubble are unpersuaded.\n\nNeiman: In France and the UK, the role of political parties as organizations is far more critical than in the U.S. So the parties can act in more concerted and organized ways. Party members in the UK are also able to dump quickly their party leader. I imagine if for whatever reason a party leader was seen as a serious election liability, the party would dump her or him. Remember Liz Truss? She served as UK prime minister for 45 days after Boris Johnson resigned, because she was dumped by her party.\n\nOur system makes things much dicier should a presidential candidate be suddenly in deep political trouble AFTER the primaries. The process is much more diffuse and sloppy, even in the case where a candidate dies or becomes incapacitated. If things don\u2019t settle down before the Democratic Convention, there are many opportunities for a lot of chaos to happen if Biden\u2019s polling numbers are clearly dismal and he hasn\u2019t obviated the still-worsening disquiet about his candidacy.\n\nQ: The left triumphed in French and UK elections due to coalition-building. Does our two-party system make similar tactical strategies impossible?\n\nNeiman: There are no formal arrangements that Democrats can make, with or without Biden at the head of the ticket, with other \u201cparties.\u201d The \u201cNo Labels\u201d people are refusing to take a position, so far, on the national ticket. And, of course, the leaders of the RFK, Jr. campaign or the Green Party aren\u2019t very helpful in this either.\n\nIt is likely true that the largest group of voters is a combination of \u201cNever Trump\u201d or a \u201cNot Trump\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not voting for either guy,\u201d plus the Biden voters. If Biden or Democrats want to beat Trump, they\u2019ve got to maximize the pool of non-Trump voters. Getting them sufficiently alarmed about a second Trump Administration to motivate them to the polls and vote for Biden is the tough task Democrats have. And there are no institutional levers available in the way anti-far right leaders in the UK or Britain have.\n\nBowler: (In the past) squabbling between left (European) parties split the vote and enabled the extreme right to win power. In France this last election, it was political leaders who coordinated. In the UK, it was more that voters did so via \u201ctactical voting.\"\n\nQ: Polls overwhelmingly predicted a far-right win in France. What went wrong?\n\nCrosby: My initial take on this is that the polls actually got the results quite right for what they were designed to do. National Rally (NR) did in fact perform extremely well in the first round of voting (on June 30), and that was what most polls were designed to predict. What we then saw after the first round results was that a large number of candidates \u2014 literally in the hundreds \u2014 removed themselves from races to increase the chances that National Rally would not win in the second round. A good explanation of this reshuffling of the race is here.\n\nMost of the original polls were not designed to predict the new (and revised) second round race. We had an extremely limited number of polls that specifically examined the second round. The second round results underscore the need to have timely polls designed to measure the race as it stands as close to the election as possible. In fairness, the French system also makes accurate polling for the second round more difficult since the deadline to drop out of the race was less than a week before second-round voting.\n\nQ: In two-step/runoff/ranked-choice voting systems such as in France and the UK, voters rank candidates in order of preference (first choice, second choice, third choice, etc.) instead of choosing only one candidate, then there are runoffs until a majority winner emerges. What is the advantage of such voting systems for political parties?\n\nNeiman: The two-step process in France allows the left and center parties to consider the results of the first stage and act accordingly. The prospect of a far right victory looming close-by after the first stage no doubt frightened the hell out of folks and there was time for them to use the institutional features in France to organize against the far right. And because the party structure in UK is strong, they could get members to strategically drop from the ticket in ways to maximize the success of the left (Labour) in the UK.\n\nBowler: We don\u2019t have a runoff system like France where the first round gives everyone a lot of information about who should step down. Those options aren\u2019t open to the U.S. left. (The U.S. has) polls. These are generally pretty good, but they are not election results. Polling results can be spun and interpreted about what might happen. (Runoff) election results are what actually happens.",

        "text": "Disapproval of Israeli Action in Gaza Eases Slightly in U.S.\nWASHINGTON, D.C. -- Americans continue to be more likely to oppose than support Israel\u2019s military action in Gaza, but public backing has increased slightly since Gallup\u2019s prior reading in March. The 42% of U.S. adults who currently approve of the military campaign is up six percentage points, while the 48% who now disapprove is down seven points.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nThese findings are from a June 3-23 poll, which began after Israel\u2019s military campaign in the Gazan city of Rafah drew international criticism, and optimism about a potential hostage and cease-fire deal had faded. The poll was completed before an announcement that there had been significant new progress in reaching a cease-fire deal in the conflict.\n\nThe latest increase in Americans\u2019 approval of Israel\u2019s military action is largely the result of a 12-point increase among Republicans, to 76%, which is higher than the group\u2019s initial reading in the month after Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Meanwhile, Democrats\u2019 and independents\u2019 support in the June poll edged up five points each -- to 23% and 34%, respectively, with majorities of each group still expressing disapproval.\n\nIn Gallup\u2019s initial November reading, 50% of Americans approved of Israel\u2019s military action in response to the surprise attack by Hamas, and 45% disapproved. Republicans (71%) were much more supportive of Israel than Democrats (36%) and independents (47%) were, and they have continued to be in the ensuing months.\n\nAs the war progressed, the United Nations and others in the international community raised deep concern about the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Gaza. In March, U.S. adults\u2019 approval of Israel\u2019s efforts fell to 36%, with 55% disapproving. Although all party groups showed declines in approval of Israel\u2019s efforts, these were larger among Democrats and independents (-18 points each) than Republicans (-7 points).\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nAdults 55 and older (51%) and those aged 35 to 54 (43%) are more likely than their younger counterparts under 35 (27%) to approve of Israel\u2019s military action.\n\nMore Americans View Netanyahu Unfavorably Than Favorably\n\nSince 1997, Gallup has asked Americans for their views on Benjamin Netanyahu, who has served as Israel\u2019s prime minister (from 1996-1999, 2009-June 2021 and since November 2022) and now leads the most conservative government in the country's history. Until December 2023, Netanyahu had been viewed more positively than negatively by Americans in all readings except one, in 1997, when many were not familiar with him.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s unfavorable rating of 47% last December far outpaced his 33% favorable rating, and the current poll shows the continuation of that sharp reversal in the trend, with 45% of Americans now viewing him unfavorably and 35% favorably.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nRepublicans have consistently been more positive than Democrats or independents about Netanyahu. Republicans\u2019 latest favorable rating of him, 66%, is up 11 points since December and is the second highest for the group (the high was 73% in 2017). In contrast, the 12% of Democrats who view Netanyahu favorably is a new low dating back to 1999, and the 30% of independents with the same view ties that group\u2019s record low.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nThis low rating from rank-and-file Democrats mirrors what many Democratic leaders have voiced. Although the U.S. has continued to support Israel, President Joe Biden, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and other congressional Democrats have indicated concern about Israel\u2019s actions on a number of occasions.\n\nRepublican House Speaker Mike Johnson has invited Netanyahu to address a joint session of Congress later this month, and the prime minister is expected to meet with Biden when he comes to the U.S. Schumer, who in March publicly called for Netanyahu to hold new elections, has said he will attend the address out of respect for the broader U.S.-Israel relationship. However, some Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate have said they will not attend the address in protest.\n\nImplications\n\nMore Americans disapprove of Israel\u2019s military action in Gaza than approve, and their opinions of Netanyahu are also negative on balance. Republicans remain much more likely than Democrats and independents to approve of Israel\u2019s military action and to view Netanyahu favorably, consistent with the party groups\u2019 broader opinions of Israel and the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. With a possible cease-fire deal and Netanyahu\u2019s U.S. visit looming, Americans\u2019 views of Israel and its leader could shift again in the coming weeks.\n\nTo stay up to date with the latest Gallup News insights and updates, follow us on X @Gallup.\n\nLearn more about how the Gallup Poll Social Series works.\n\nView complete question responses and trends (PDF download).\n\n###Embeddable###",

        "text": "\u2018Blitz primary\u2019: the scenario that could turn replacing Biden into a \u2018riveting spectacle\u2019\nIn the morass in which the Democratic party now finds itself over Joe Biden\u2019s troubled presidential candidacy, a prominent narrative is that the party is confronted by two dire options: an aged and weakened Biden stumbles on to November, or he stands down, igniting an acrimonious and chaotic scramble for his replacement.\n\nEither way, Donald Trump wins.\n\nOver the past few days, however, energy has been building around a third, more optimistic solution. Advocates of this alternative model believe it could reinvigorate Democrats by putting the spotlight on young fresh talent, inspire the country with a powerful articulation of the party\u2019s values and, critically, prevent Trump from returning to the White House bent on unleashing a full-blown attack on American democracy.\n\nThe idea is being floated by a loose affiliation of Democratic party stalwarts, including former senior government officials and elected representatives, major donors, and current party officeholders. They are calling their plan the \u201cblitz primary\u201d\u2013 a quickfire, tightly controlled selection process that would culminate with a younger successor to Biden being nominated at next month\u2019s Democratic national convention.\n\n\u201cThe question is: how can we flip this disaster into something remarkable?\u201d said Ted Dintersmith, a venture capitalist and entrepreneur who is a leading proponent of the blitz primary idea. \u201cWhat would totally shift the national narrative, turning bad options into an opportunity?\u201d\n\nDintersmith, who in 2012 was appointed by Barack Obama to represent the US at the UN general assembly, estimates that about 70 prominent individuals have participated in the search for an alternative. Discussions have focused on how to move beyond the crisis in which the Democratic party has been propelled by Biden\u2019s lamentable performance in last month\u2019s presidential debate which has sown doubt both about the president\u2019s mental acuity and his electability.\n\nThe blitz primary is posited on Biden voluntarily stepping down as the party\u2019s nominee and playing an active role in the process. With his involvement, a shortlist of five to eight younger candidates would be identified, drawn from the Biden administration, Democratic state governors and other rising stars of the party.\n\nNames mentioned include Vice-President Kamala Harris; Governors Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Gavin Newsom of California, and Andy Beshear of Kentucky; the US senator from Georgia, Raphael Warnock; and Biden cabinet members such as the commerce secretary, Gina Raimondo, and the transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Kentucky governor, Andy Beshear, is one of the names mentioned as a potential younger candidate to replace Joe Biden if the president were to withdraw. Photograph: Timothy D Easley/AP\n\nA controversial aspect of the blitz primary model is that Harris would be required to compete on equal terms \u2013 there would be no anointing her as Biden\u2019s heir. Allan Katz, the former US ambassador to Portugal under Obama who has helped frame the blueprint, said that if she emerged as the nominee she would do so \u201cas a much stronger, much better candidate than if the nomination was just handed to her\u201d.\n\nThe younger generation of leaders would be introduced to the nation through a series of televised town halls running up to the convention in Chicago on 19 August. Moderators would be selected for their dynamic ability to attract large primetime audiences especially of younger voters, snatching back the media limelight from Trump.\n\nOprah Winfrey, Michelle Obama, the historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, and even Taylor Swift have been floated as fantasy interlocutors.\n\n\u201cIt would increase the number of Americans actually paying attention,\u201d said Rosa Brooks, a key advocate of the blitz primary who held senior positions in both the Obama and Bill Clinton administrations and was a volunteer policy adviser for Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign. She added: \u201cFor delegates it would be a chance for them to see how the candidates performed in front of the American people \u2013 because in the end this is about finding a candidate who is most likely to defeat Trump.\u201d\n\nBrooks pointed out that under party rules, if and when Biden agreed to withdraw he would release his 3,904 delegates who would then be free to pick a new nominee of their choice. Under the blitz primary formula, a vote would be staged before the Chicago convention to avoid the risk of an ugly and bruising spectacle at the event itself.\n\nSelection would be by ranked choice voting. Delegates would vote only once, but list all candidates in order of preference.\n\nView image in fullscreen Senator Raphael Warnock. Photograph: Alex Brandon/AP\n\nContenders would then be eliminated one by one, and their votes redistributed to those remaining, in a process that could be staggered over several days for maximum TV suspense and exposure. That would have the dual benefit of increasing public engagement, as well as ensuring that the final winner would have very broad appeal.\n\n\u201cIt would be a riveting spectacle,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cIt would be a way of getting people focused on the issue and the fact that the Democrats are not, in fact, a one-person party.\u201d\n\nBlitz primary advocates report that the model has proven to be popular among those they have tested it against. Brooks said that she has had private conversations with senior Biden administration officials who expressed support.\n\n\u201cPeople in very senior positions within the administration have said to us privately, \u2018Thank you, we\u2019re glad you\u2019re doing this. We need Biden to withdraw and we need some better process,\u2019\u201d Brooks said.\n\nThe architects of the blitz primary have no illusions about how difficult it would be to achieve \u2013 not least because the entire plan rests upon Biden agreeing to quit the race. So far he has shown no sign of doing that, stating in interviews and an open letter that he intends to stick it out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very long shot, I know, as there are a whole bunch of things that have to line up,\u201d Dintersmith said. \u201cBut our party is bursting with creative talent, and we have the ability to transform the election, energize the country, and come out of this in a better place as a nation than we are today.\u201d\n\nBrooks said: \u201cWe are up against a failure of imagination and courage \u2013 a failure to see that there are other possibilities if we are willing to move quickly and be creative. There are risks associated with that, of course, but there is a huge risk with the current approach \u2013 the risk of an autocrat determined to destroy democracy getting back into the White House.\u201d",

        "text": "US House to vote on bill to require proof of citizenship to vote despite no evidence of non-citizen ballots\nCongressional Republicans will vote this week on a bill to require people to show proof of citizenship to register to vote, a move that comes as they lay the groundwork for undermining election results in November.\n\nThe House will vote on the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility bill, or Save Act, which would make states require, in person, documents that prove a person is a US citizen when registering to vote. This can include a Real ID, passport or other kinds of identification that show a person\u2019s place of birth. It wouldn\u2019t include a standard drivers license as a sole form of identification and calls for a secondary proof of place of birth alongside it, like a birth certificate.\n\nIt also calls for states to remove non-citizens from their rolls and for the homeland security department to potentially start the deportation process for people unlawfully registered.\n\nThese changes, voting rights advocates warn, would prevent some US citizens from voting \u2013 such as those who don\u2019t have the proper documentation or the ability to provide it in person. The bill could lead to people who are able to vote, such as naturalized citizens, college students and tribal voters, being removed from voter rolls.\n\nIt is already illegal for non-citizens to vote in federal elections. It\u2019s also illegal to register to vote if you aren\u2019t eligible \u2013 federal voter registration forms require you to attest that you are a US citizen. Some local elections allow non-citizen participation, but it is not the norm. There is no evidence of widespread non-citizen voting.\n\nTrump pressured Congress to approve the bill on Tuesday, writing on Truth Social: \u201cRepublicans must pass the Save Act, or go home and cry yourself to sleep. Non citizen Illegal Migrants are getting the right to vote, being pushed by crooked Democrat Politicians who are not being stopped by an equally dishonest Justice Department. Our whole voting system is under siege.\u201d\n\nThe bill is unlikely to pass in the Democrat-controlled Senate or make it into law, as the Biden White House has said it does not approve of it. The White House said in a statement that it \u201cstrongly opposes\u201d the bill, indicating the president would veto it if it somehow made it to his desk.\n\n\u201cThis bill would do nothing to safeguard our elections, but it would make it much harder for all eligible Americans to register to vote and increase the risk that eligible voters are purged from voter rolls,\u201d the statement says.\n\nNon-citizen voting has become a key plank for Republicans as it combines two red-meat issues in the Trump era: illegal immigration and voter fraud. With an influx of asylum seekers coming into the country in the Biden administration, Trump and his allies have turned up the heat on non-citizen voting claims, a longtime Republican talking point.\n\nFar-right figures, including Cleta Mitchell, have formed a coalition to push the idea. Heritage Action, the political arm of the conservative thinktank behind Project 2025, considers approval of the Save Act a \u201ckey vote\u201d in its scorecard for lawmakers. Elon Musk, the owner of X, has promoted the bill as well, alluding to the death penalty as a consequence for people who didn\u2019t support the Save Act: \u201cThose who oppose this are traitors. All Caps: TRAITORS. What is the penalty for traitors again?\u201d\n\nProponents of the bill have not offered proof that rampant non-citizen voting, or even non-citizens registering to vote, is happening, relying instead on gut feelings. Mike Johnson, the House speaker, said during a press conference on the bill that \u201cwe all know \u2013 intuitively \u2013 that a lot of illegals are voting in federal elections. But it\u2019s not been something that is easily provable.\u201d\n\nThe bill is just one part of Republican efforts to go after perceived non-citizen voting. An executive order from Biden in 2021 that called on agencies to increase voter registration has become an unlikely source of pushback because of claims it could involve registering non-citizens. The Tennessee secretary of state sent out letters to some voters saying they needed to provide proof of citizenship, a move that is legally questionable at best and that voting rights advocates have said amounts to voter intimidation.\n\nSome states have tried to require proof of citizenship or otherwise attempted to remove potential non-citizens from the rolls, resulting in legal battles and erroneously identifying thousands of qualified voters for potential removal.\n\nThe US supreme court has said that states can\u2019t require proof of citizenship for federal elections. Arizona voters approved a law in 2004 to require such proof in order to vote there. But the top court ruled in 2013 that the state could only require it for state or local elections, setting up a bifurcated system for voting proof in Arizona.",

        "text": "Nigel Farage to support Donald Trump in upcoming US election\nFarage to support Trump in upcoming US election\n\n@Nigel_Farage Mr Farage was the first UK politician to meet Donald Trump after he became US president in 2016\n\nNigel Farage said becoming an MP meant he would spend less time in the US supporting Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, but believed the Republican's re-election was \u201cabsolutely vital\u201d for world peace. The Reform UK leader was elected as MP for Clacton, one of five seats his party secured at the 2024 general election. Mr Farage spoke at several rallies during Mr Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, but has told the BBC this time \u201cit\u2019ll be a couple of flying visits\u201d. \u201cI passionately believe that Trump is the right person to be the next president,\u201d Mr Farage said.\n\nStuart Woodward/BBC Nigel Farage was elected to the House of Commons on his eighth attempt\n\nTrump \u2018a peace-maker\u2019\n\nWars in Ukraine and the Middle East meant \u201cthe world is more dangerous now\u201d, Mr Farage said. He added: \u201cAmerica leads the Western world and therefore who becomes the next president matters to all of us. \u201cI think peace comes through strength, not through weakness. \u201c[Mr Trump] is, by instinct, a peace-maker, so I do believe his election and the future of NATO is absolutely vital.\u201d\n\nWhile on a visit to Jaywick, Mr Farage told the BBC it was \u201ca fair criticism\u201d that his time would be divided between local constituency issues and his national priorities. He said, however, he had already met with Tendring District Council leaders and had \u201ca base of local people working on the ground\u201d who he \u201ccan\u2019t do [the job] without\u201d. \u201cMost MPs have six or eight weeks of holiday a year - I\u2019ll have hardly any,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be lucky to get 10 days holiday in my next year. I work incredibly hard at whatever I do.\u201d Mr Farage also told the BBC how he \u201chadn\u2019t had time yet\u201d for house-hunting in Clacton since being elected, but had put \u201ca couple of feelers out\u201d. Mr Trump congratulated Mr Farage on social media following his election to Parliament.\n\nFollow Essex news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story?

        "text": "European leaders reaffirm commitment to NATO amid US presidential election uncertainty\nThe threat of Trump's potential return to the White House has increasingly raised questions in Brussels about Washington's continued commitment to the alliance.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAs NATO's anniversary summit in Washington kicked off, European leaders were quick to reiterate their increased spending for the alliance as the questions over the US' changing presidency and Ukraine's potential admission remain.\n\nOn the eve of the conference, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell noted that Europe had been increasing its contributions to the transatlantic alliance but did not hold back from questioning the US over its growing hesitance in helping out Ukraine.\n\n\"Allow me to remind you that the awakening of Europe \u2014 as much-needed as it is \u2014 should not imply that the US should rest easy,\" Borrell said on Tuesday before adding that Washington's deliberation over sending military support to Kyiv came \"with a bill (to pay) in terms of human lives lost\".\n\nLatvia's President Edgars Rink\u0113vi\u010ds said, \"there is a debate in the US that the US is doing a lot to support Ukraine and Europe is not doing enough. If you look at figures, it\u2019s actually a different picture. Europe is doing more than the US.\"\n\n\"We are taking security and defence seriously.\"\n\nThe cutting remarks from European leaders came as the US prepares for an election in which incumbent President Joe Biden will run against the former president and known NATO-sceptic Donald Trump.\n\nBiden has been straining to convince some members of his own party that he is the right candidate for the presidential race. Meanwhile, his reelection bid has been plagued with doubts surrounding his mental acuity following a disastrous debate in which many said he underperformed.\n\nThe threat of Trump's potential return to the White House has increasingly raised questions in Brussels about Washington's continued commitment to the alliance. Trump has previously been critical of the pact and its members, threatening to quit if other countries do not increase their spending.\n\nIn a campaign speech in February, Trump asserted that he would encourage Russia to do \"whatever they want\" to NATO members who did not meet their defence spending goals.\n\nConfirmation that Europe was taking its contributions to NATO seriously was echoed by others during the start of the summit, who took to X to express their support for the alliance, including the recent nominee to replace Borrell in his role as EU High Representative, Kaja Kallas.\n\n\"We shouldn't be afraid of our own strength,\" Kallas pointed out.\n\nUkraine's admission into the alliance\n\nElsewhere, countries tried to give assurances that Kyiv would eventually join the alliance \u2014 however, not until after Russia's war in Ukraine was over.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Ukraine's path to joining NATO is \"irreversible\" but fell short of committing to an actual timeline.\n\nOutgoing NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg echoed Blinken's words, telling reporters on Wednesday that Ukraine will join NATO, but it was \"too early to say when that will happen\u201d.\n\nA statement from the 32 allies this Wednesday is expected to further affirm the alliance's commitment to Ukraine, following Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's push for a clearly-worded guarantee that Ukraine can join the alliance.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHowever, some countries have opposed Ukraine's membership, saying that it would open the risk for allies of the alliance to be drawn into a wider war.\n\n\"It is clear to everyone that Ukraine's membership of NATO is still not a realistic option, as it would entail the risk of direct confrontation with Russia,\" Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 said.",

        "text": "Kylian Mbappe and George Clooney voice their political opinions. But do celebrity interventions have an impact on elections?\nKylian Mbappe and George Clooney voice their political opinions. But do celebrity interventions have an impact on elections? In France, soccer star Kylian Mbappe warned that the far-right being in government in France would be \u2018catastrophic\u2019. In the U.S., actor George Clooney is asking President Joe Biden to step aside. Soccer star Kylian Mbappe urged the French electorate not to put the country\u2019s government \u2018in the hands\u2019 of the far-right. Photo by Grzegorz Wajda / Sipa via AP Images\n\nLONDON \u2014 Soccer supremo Kylian Mbappe may not have been able to propel France to victory in Euro 2024 but did he score a personal political win by trying to derail the far-right\u2019s path to government?\n\nBefore the first round of voting in the National Assembly elections last month, Mbappe had urged France\u2019s young voters to reject extremism. His message did not stop National Rally, Marine Le Pen\u2019s anti-immigration party, from securing a third of all votes cast, putting it on track to form a government.\n\nWith Le Pen\u2019s far-right cohort on the march, Mbappe decided it was time for a more direct approach ahead of the second round of voting on July 7.\n\n\u201cWe cannot leave our country in the hands of these people, it is really urgent,\u201d the 25-year-old said during a press conference in Germany two days before polls opened. \u201cWe saw the results of the first round, it\u2019s catastrophic. We really hope that this will change and that everyone will mobilize to vote \u2026 and vote for the right side.\u201d\n\nMbappe did not get the result he wanted in the Euros, with Les Bleus crashing out after a 2-1 defeat to Spain in the semifinal on Tuesday. The outcome of the second round of voting in the parliamentary election will likely have been far more satisfying to him, however.\n\nNational Rally was pushed into third place as tactical voters rallied behind the New Popular Front, a left-wing coalition, and President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s second-place centrist Together alliance in a result that produced a hung parliament.\n\nIn the United States, actor George Clooney made headlines on Wednesday when he called on President Joe Biden to step aside in his race against former President Donald Trump.\n\nIn a New York Times guest essay, Clooney cited fears the 81-year-old Democratic president is ailing.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I\u2019ve spoken with in private,\u201d Clooney wrote.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe \u2018big F-ing deal\u2019 Biden of 2010,\u201d Clooney wrote. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\u201d\n\nCelebrity endorsements are common in the U.S. and they are becoming mainstream in the U.K. as well.\n\n\u201cLove, Actually\u201d and \u201cNotting Hill\u201d star Hugh Grant spent the 2019 general election campaigning for anti-Brexit candidates, while Robert Del Naja from British trip-hop group Massive Attack voiced support for Green Party leader Carla Denyer in her successful bid for election as a member of Parliament in last week\u2019s national vote.\n\nIn a culture where potential lawmakers have to try to shout above the daily noise of competing interests, Josephine Harmon, an assistant professor of political science at Northeastern University in London, says endorsements by popular celebrities can \u201cadd a bit of gold dust to a politician\u2019s status.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it helps them seem humanized and popular,\u201d Harmon says. \u201cUltimately, that is what politics is about and I think it can give politicians a boost if people associate them with a favored celebrity.\u201d\n\nCelebrities and other so-called \u201cinfluencers,\u201d with their huge social media followings and ability to generate headlines, can also broaden appeal for politicians slugging it out on the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, Taylor Swift came out for [U.S. President] Joe Biden and during the election [American rapper] Cardi B did a lot with Bernie Sanders,\u201d Harmon says.\n\n\u201cThat can clearly reach a younger audience who may not otherwise follow politics. \u201cIf you suddenly see it in your social media feed or on TikTok or wherever, and see your favorite celebrity has done an interview or had a conversation with a politician, that politician is much more likely to get traction just by having that entry into people\u2019s attention spans.\u201d",

        "text": "Russia interfering in 2024 election to help Trump, US intelligence officials say\nOfficials with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) have warned that Russia has launched a plan to interfere in the 2024 election to bolster the chances of former President Trump being re-elected.\n\nIn a briefing with reporters on Tuesday, ODNI officials said that Russia is the \"preeminent threat\" to the election and that while China doesn\u2019t plan to influence the outcome of the presidential race, the communist nation is being carefully monitored to see if it mingles in down-ballot races.\n\n\"It's all the tactics we've seen before, primarily through social media, efforts using influential U.S. voices to amplify their narratives and other tactics,\" an official said. \"And as far as who they're targeting, what we can say today is, Russia is sophisticated enough to know that, targeting swing state voters is, particularly valuable to them.\"\n\nWAPO ADMITS RUSSIAN TROLLS 'HAD LITTLE INFLUENCE ON 2016 VOTERS' AFTER YEARS HYPING THEIR ROLE IN TRUMP'S WIN\n\nOfficials said that the intelligence community expects Russia will increase its underhanded activities as U.S. election day gets closer in order to manipulate public opinion, underscoring the threat to America\u2019s political landscape.\n\nAlthough former President Trump was not named specifically, ODNI officials said that the Russian interference is mimicking what it says were similar preferences for U.S. presidential candidates seen in previous election cycles.\n\nRussia is \"undertaking a whole-of-government approach to influence the election, including the presidential race, Congress and public opinion,\" the official said, noting that Russia has grown \"more sophisticated\" over the years in election interference.\n\nThe Kremlin, officials said, is seeking to influence specific voting groups in swing states, as well as looking to promote divisive narratives and denigrate specific politicians, although no specifics were provided.\n\nAn official said that artificial intelligence (A.I.) is making it easier for Russia \u2013 and other actors \u2013 to interfere in the U.S. political syatem, since the technology allows Kremlin operatives to mimic American Southern or Midwestern accents.\n\n'PRO-RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE NETWORKS' EXIST IN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, BELGIAN PM SAYS\n\nThe Trump campaign and the Russian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital requests for comment.\n\n\"Foreign adversaries continue to experiment with and have adopted at least some generative AI tools to more quickly and cheaply generate authentic looking content tailored primarily for social media platforms that can target specific audiences including in the U.S.,\" an ODNI official said during the briefing, noting a heavy focus on its use by Russia and China.\n\nThe official added, \"China would be interested in down-ballot races down to the state and potentially local level. But to be clear, this is something we're watching at this time, rather than, actively seeing it as we did in the 2022 cycle. Right now, our assessment is focused that China doesn't perceive a benefit in supporting either candidate, or either party.\"\n\nThe official said that China is pulling data from TikTok and other social media platforms used in the U.S. in order to spread their influence narratives, as well as to collect publicly available data on users and public opinion.\n\nMeanwhile, the ODNI official said that Iran is seeking to stoke social divisions among the U.S. population and \"undermine confidence in the US democratic institutions around the elections.\"\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Avril Haines said Tuesday that Iran is attempting through social media to covertly stoke protests in the U.S. against the war in Gaza.\n\n\"We have observed actors tied to Iran\u2019s government posing as activists online, seeking to encourage protests, and even providing financial support to protesters,\" Haines said, adding that Americans protesting in good faith may not know they are being influenced by the Iranian regime.\n\n\"We urge all Americans to remain vigilant as they engage online with accounts and actors they do not personally know.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTuesday\u2019s briefing came on the same day that the Justice Department nabbed an alleged social media \"bot farm\" run by the Russian government that was being used to spread disinformation in the U.S. and other countries.\n\nThe Justice Department said it seized two domain names and identified 968 social media profiles used by Russian actors in the Netherlands to create AI-enhanced social media profiles to promote messages in support of Russian government objectives.\n\nOne of the fake messages posted on X, formerly Twitter, in 2023 included a video of Russian President Vladimir Putin justifying the country\u2019s actions in Ukraine, although the video only had a handful of views.\n\nFox News' Liz Friden contributed to this report.",

        "text": "US election: Kamala Harris becomes tempting alternative to Joe Biden\nKamala Harris arrives in Las Vegas on July 9, 2024. KEVIN LAMARQUE / REUTERS\n\nThis article was published on July 10, before Joe Biden's decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race.\n\nAbove all, her goal is not to fail, nor to expose herself to suspicions of disloyalty. Better to let others speculate on her d\u00e9but as a candidate, rather than as a running mate. Ever since US President Joe Biden's train wreck performance in a televised debate against Donald Trump on June 27, Kamala Harris has stood by him in solidarity. On Independence Day, a photo immortalized them, beaming, on the balcony of the White House residence, watching the fireworks.\n\nTwo days later, the vice president attended the Essence Festival of Culture in New Orleans. During a public conversation, she said nothing about the doubts that have beset the Democratic party about Biden's ability to run a campaign. Instead, she spoke with ease about her background and career, a story delivered on autopilot, and one she has refined over the years. Above all, she once again drew up an indictment \u2013 as a former magistrate \u2013 against Republican candidate Trump.\n\nThe Harris temptation is surfacing. It permeates the halls of Congress, raising questions among experts who pore over electoral maps and polls. Trump represents a danger to the rule of law and American democracy, but he is also a candidate with many vulnerabilities.\n\nTo exploit them, wouldn't it be better to endorse Harris, rather than Biden, who is so vulnerable and weakened? A few voices have publicly expressed their support. On July 7, Adam Schiff, a US House representative from California, suggested that Harris would be a \"phenomenal\" president. The next day, Adam Smith, his colleague from Washington state, was on CNN. He openly called on the president to step down, considering him \"not the best person to carry the Democratic message.\" \"The campaign strategy of 'be quiet and fall in line and let\u2019s ignore it' simply isn\u2019t working,\" said Smith, before adding, \"Personally, I think Kamala Harris would be a much better, stronger candidate.\"\n\nAs for Harris, she knows the fickleness of the press, which has long been very harsh with her, and the nervousness of her former colleagues in Congress, who are preoccupied with their re-election in November. However, her entourage has been vigilant: She must not leave other contenders with any hope.\n\nShe alone has a national presence, she alone has access to the campaign funds that have already been accumulated, she alone has already undergone the powerful crushing pressure of a presidential election. Two days after the televised debate, she attended a fundraising party in Los Angeles on June 29, at film director Rob Reiner's home. \"I am empirical proof of the promise of America,\" she said, brushing the debate aside in a few words, to focus on the Trump threat and the successes of the current administration. However, there was no personal defense of Biden. The message was simple: Make your comparisons, it's terrible on the other side.\n\nYou have 71.47% of this article left to read.

        "text": "US Election 2024: Poll shows Clinton-Harris ticket leading over Biden-Harris against Trump\nA recent poll conducted by the Democratic firm Bendixen & Amandi reveals shifting dynamics in the 2024 presidential race.\n\nAccording to the survey, Vice President Kamala Harris and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton currently have a better chance against former President Donald Trump than President Joe Biden.\n\nA recent poll reveals a tight race between Trump and Biden, with Trump leading by a single percentage point (43% to 42%). However, when paired against Trump, Harris and Clinton fare slightly better, with Harris leading 42% to 41% and Clinton leading 43% to 41%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, a hypothetical Clinton-Harris ticket appears to have a slight advantage over the current Biden-Harris pairing, with a 43% to 40% lead over Trump, as reported by The Independent.\n\nThe survey also found that among the 86% of likely voters who watched part of the June 27 debate between Biden and Trump, only 29% believe Biden has the stamina and mental capacity for another term, while 61% do not.\n\nAmidst growing speculation about President Biden\u2019s health, a memo to White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre has sparked further controversy.\n\nThe memo comes on the heels of a heated press briefing where Jean-Pierre categorically denied that Biden has been diagnosed with or is receiving treatment for Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe denial came in response to questions about Dr. Lawrence Cannard, a movement disorders specialist, visiting the White House multiple times.\n\nDespite the denial, a recent poll shows that only 33% of respondents believe Biden should continue as the Democratic nominee, while 52% think he should step down.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Biden\u2019s health and potential neurological issues continues to swirl, fueling debates about his fitness for office.\n\nFernand Amandi, the veteran Miami based pollster behind the survey, emphasized the growing concerns among voters regarding Biden\u2019s fitness for office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cVoters have significant concerns about President Biden\u2019s advanced age, and their concerns have only grown louder,\u201d Amandi said. He added, \u201cBut these concerns have not yet created a decisive advantage for Trump.\u201d\n\nThe survey also highlighted concerns about Biden\u2019s stamina and mental capacity.\n\nOut of 86% of likely voters who watched the recent debate between Biden and Trump, only 29% believe Biden has the necessary stamina and mental acuity for another term, while 61% disagree.\n\nAlso read | Biden\u2019s health sparks debate amid US presidential race\n\nThis has led to a stark division within the Democratic Party, with 52% of respondents believing Biden should step aside and only 33% supporting his continued candidacy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn contrast, the hypothetical Clinton-Harris ticket appears to be more appealing to voters.\n\nAmandi said, \u201cClinton-Harris is in the strongest position among potential Democratic tickets tested, showing a clear edge over the Biden-Harris pairing.\u201d\n\nThe survey results reflect a notable shift in voter sentiment, potentially reshaping the Democratic strategy as the 2024 election approaches.",

        "text": "The surprising economic upside to money in US politics\nInstead, the researchers find that Citizens United allowed more companies, especially those that were smaller and younger, to participate in the political process at the state level. This, in turn, diluted the power of established special interests, which had long relied on lobbying and personal ties to lawmakers to help sway policymaking. The court ruling also shook up state elections: Incumbent governors and state legislators lost their bids for re-election at higher rates, impacting Democrats and Republicans similarly.\n\nThe increased turnover shifted the focus of state policymaking, according to Buchak. Elected officials were more prone to adopt pro-growth laws and regulations, and avoid controversial social issues, to appeal to a broader voter base. The growth-focused agendas paid off as businesses expanded, lifting total output within states by 2 percent on average.\n\nBuchak calls the study results \u201cvery surprising,\u201d especially the finding that workers benefited directly from Citizens United \u2014 a result that challenges assumptions that big business and other deep-pocketed donors would gain the most from Citizens United.\n\n\u201cWe thought, like everyone else did, that Citizens United would help businesses and that workers would be worse off in the end,\u201d says Buchak, who is an associate professor of finance at Stanford Graduate School of Business. \u201cAs it turns out, both are better off.\u201d\n\nBiggest winners: New corporate donors\n\nWhen Buchak and his coauthors \u2014 Pat Akey of the University of Toronto, Tania Babina of Columbia Business School, and Ana-Maria Tenekedjieva of The Federal Reserve Board \u2014 set out to study how politics impacts workers versus employers, they found an ideal experiment in the Citizens United case: 23 states had campaign spending limits that the Supreme Court invalidated on the grounds that political donations constitute free speech. The remaining 27 states did not have restrictions, so they were unaffected by the decision.\n\nThe real-life split allowed the researchers to compare the two groups of states and link the economic outcomes they find to Citizens United. The researchers collected data from nearly 20 sources, including the Internal Revenue Service and The Bureau of Economic Analysis. They also ruled out other potential reasons for the increases, including the economic recovery from the 2008-09 financial crisis and the surge in oil and natural gas production beginning around 2010 known as the \u201cshale boom.\u201d\n\nThe researchers conclude that the economic benefits they identify were the direct result of Citizens United, which enabled new types of donors to seek political influence and increased turnover in state government. As politicians sought to appeal to a broader donor base, they were more likely to adopt more centrist policies focused on economic growth.\n\n\u201cCitizens United appears to have motivated politicians at the state level to avoid socially divisive issues like gay marriage and abortion and work together on economic policies that would at minimum deliver a small benefit to everybody,\u201d Buchak says.\n\nAmong the biggest beneficiaries of these pro-growth policies, the researchers find, were companies that either weren\u2019t around or weren\u2019t active in politics when the Citizens United decision came down.\n\nJobs and wages grew the most, they show, at companies that were 5 years-old or less. Earnings for workers at these companies grew almost twice as fast as incomes among employees of similarly sized older businesses. And among large businesses that had no known political connections prior to the court ruling, wages for workers grew more than they did for employees at large companies with longstanding political ties.\n\n\u201cThe turnover in state government that followed Citizens United appears to have led to laws and regulations that were most beneficial to companies that were no longer political outsiders,\u201d Buchak says.\n\nThe Citizens United paradox\n\nEven so, the study has a few important limitations. One is that the data analysis ends in 2016, when Donald Trump was elected president. The political landscape has changed significantly since, and it\u2019s not just that polarization has deepened and campaign spending has skyrocketed. Companies, for example, are more likely to take a stance on social issues, like Google\u2019s recent confrontation with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis over the state\u2019s so-called \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d law and the company\u2019s special tax status.\n\n\u201cA lot of issues in the 2024 election are very different today than from what they were when Trump was elected,\u201d Buchak cautions. \u201cPoliticians and coordinated special interests are much more engaged in social issues, and we don\u2019t yet know what the economic effects of that may be.\u201d\n\nAlso, although the study finds that Citizens United boosted wages, hiring, and business incomes, that doesn\u2019t mean that the pro-growth policies that enabled those benefits are necessarily beneficial in the long run.\n\nThere\u2019s one more critical caveat, says Buchak: He and his coauthors aren\u2019t saying that unlimited campaign donations \u2014 or even money in politics more broadly \u2014 are good for democracy just because, as their Citizens United analysis shows, they contributed to economic growth.\n\n\u201cIf no money and no outside influence in politics are the best-case scenario in a democracy,\u201d Buchak says, \u201cCitizens United took us from, say, 10th best to 9th best.\u201d",

        "text": "Amid Doubts About Biden\u2019s Mental Sharpness, Trump Leads Presidential Race\nRoughly 6 in 10 voters describe both Biden and Trump as \u2018embarrassing\u2019\n\nFormer President Donald Trump was in Philadelphia for a campaign rally on June 22, roughly three weeks after President Joe Biden held one in the same city May 29. (From left: Anna Moneymaker and Andrew Harnik, both Getty Images)\n\nHow we did this Pew Research Center conducted this study to understand Americans\u2019 views of the 2024 presidential election campaign. For this analysis, we surveyed 9,424 adults \u2013 including 7,729 registered voters \u2013 from July 1-7, 2024. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), a group of people recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses who have agreed to take surveys regularly. This kind of recruitment gives nearly all U.S. adults a chance of selection. Surveys were conducted either online or by telephone with a live interviewer. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other factors. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology. Here are the questions used for this report, the topline and the survey methodology.\n\nFollowing President Joe Biden\u2019s poor performance in the June 27 debate, former President Donald Trump holds a 4 percentage point lead over Biden among registered voters: 44% say that if the election were held today, they would vote for Trump; 40% would vote for Biden, while 15% support third-party candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nVoters\u2019 doubts about Biden\u2019s mental sharpness, while not new, have become the subject of intense focus following the debate.\n\nOnly about a quarter of voters (24%) say the phrase \u201cmentally sharp\u201d describes Biden very or fairly well; more than twice as many (58%) describe Trump as mentally sharp.\n\nThe share of voters describing Biden as mentally sharp has declined 6 points since January and is considerably lower than it was in 2020.\n\nThe new survey by Pew Research Center, conducted July 1-7 among 9,424 adults, including 7,729 registered voters, finds that both Biden and Trump are widely viewed as flawed, though in different ways. And nearly seven-in-ten voters (68%) say they are not satisfied with their choices for president.\n\nAmong the survey\u2019s major findings:\n\nMost voters describe Trump as \u201cmean-spirited.\u201d Trump trails Biden on honesty and, by a narrower margin, on empathy. And about twice as many voters describe Trump as mean-spirited (64%) as say that about Biden (31%).\n\nMajorities of voters describe both Biden and Trump as \u201cembarrassing,\u201d with identical shares (63% each) saying this about each candidate. A third or more of each candidate\u2019s supporters \u2013 37% of Biden supporters and 33% of Trump supporters \u2013 say their own candidate is embarrassing. (Read more about views of the candidates in Chapter 2.)\n\nThe state of the 2024 presidential race: While Trump leads the presidential race, 44% to 40% over Biden, 17% say they support Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (15%) or another candidate (2%).\n\nIf the choices are narrowed to Biden and Trump, Trump would hold a slight edge: 50% favor Trump, while 47% support Biden.\n\nAge\n\nTrump leads Biden among voters ages 50 and older by 48% to 39%, with 11% favoring Kennedy. Trump has a more modest edge among voters 30 to 49: 42% support Trump, while 37% back Biden and 19% favor Kennedy.\n\nBiden holds a wide advantage over Trump among voters under 30 (48% to 28%). About one-in-five voters (22%) in the youngest age group say they back Kennedy.\n\nRace and ethnicity\n\nTrump has an advantage among White voters (50% to 36% for Biden), while Biden holds a wide lead over Trump among Black voters (64% to 13%, with 21% supporting Kennedy).\n\nBiden and Trump are tied among Hispanic voters (36% each), while 24% support Kennedy. Biden has a wide lead over Trump among Asian voters (47% to 29%); 19% back Kennedy.\n\nPartisanship and the 2020 vote\n\nWhile both Biden and Trump draw support from large majorities of their own parties\u2019 voters, Trump is currently holding on to more of his 2020 voters than Biden.\n\nNearly nine-in-ten validated voters (88%) who backed Trump four years ago support him today. That compares with 79% of Biden\u2019s 2020 voters who currently support him. About one-in-seven (14%) of Biden\u2019s voters four years ago prefer Kennedy today; among Trump\u2019s 2020 voters, 8% say they\u2019re voting for Kennedy. (Read more about voters\u2019 preferences in Chapter 1.)\n\nRelated: Behind Biden\u2019s victory: An examination of the 2020 electorate, based on validated voters.\n\nBroad dissatisfaction with the 2024 campaign\n\nPew Research Center surveys over the past year have found widespread unhappiness over the state of American politics and the choices for president. In the new survey, voters render harsh judgments on the 2024 campaign:\n\n87% say that so far, the campaign does not make them feel proud of the country\n\n76% say it is not focused on important policy debates\n\n68% describe the campaign as too negative.\n\nMajorities of voters across demographic groups express dissatisfaction with the presidential candidates. However, Trump supporters are far more satisfied with their choices than are either Biden or Kennedy supporters.\n\nAbout half of Trump supporters (51%) say they are very or fairly satisfied with the presidential candidates, while nearly as many (48%) say they are not too or not at all satisfied.\n\nRoughly eight-in-ten Biden supporters (81%) and an even larger majority of Kennedy supporters (90%) express dissatisfaction with the candidates.\n\nA growing share of Biden supporters would replace both Biden and Trump on the ballot\n\nSince April, there has been a modest uptick in the share of voters who say that if given the chance, they would replace both Biden and Trump on the ballot. Currently, 53% favor replacing Biden and Trump with different candidates, up from 49% in April.\n\nThis shift has come entirely among Biden supporters. In fact, Trump supporters are less likely to favor replacing both candidates than they were in April.\n\nCurrently, 71% of Biden supporters say that if they had the ability to decide the major party candidates for the 2024 election, they would replace both Biden and Trump. Roughly a quarter (23%) say they would keep Biden and replace Trump, while smaller shares would keep Trump and replace Biden (2%) or keep both candidates (3%).\n\nIn April, a smaller majority of Biden supporters (62%) favored replacing both Biden and Trump.\n\nAmong Trump supporters, by contrast, the share who would replace both candidates has declined, from 35% to 26%. The share who wants to keep both candidates on the ballot has risen from 27% to 39%.\n\nKennedy supporters are far less politically engaged than Biden or Trump supporters. Across several measures of election engagement \u2013 motivation to vote, a belief that the stakes in the election are important, attention to the campaign \u2013 there are no meaningful differences between Biden and Trump supporters.\n\nBut Kennedy supporters stand out for their low levels of engagement. For example, 39% say it really matters who wins, which is only about half the shares of Biden (79%) and Trump supporters (78%). And just 21% of Kennedy supporters say they are extremely motivated to vote; again, that is much lower than Biden or Trump supporters (63% each). (Read more about voters\u2019 preferences in Chapter 1.)\n\nRelated: Third party and independent candidates often fall short of early polling numbers.\n\nTrump holds wide leads on immigration, the economy and foreign policy. Trump holds double-digit advantages over Biden on all three issues. His lead on immigration policy is 17 points: 52% of voters are very or somewhat confident in Trump, while 35% are confident in Biden. Biden leads by 8 points on working well with officials in the opposing party (40% to 32%) and by 4 points on making good decisions on abortion policy (48% to 44%). (Read more about voters\u2019 preferences on issues in Chapter 2.)\n\nJust 30% of Trump\u2019s supporters like the way he conducts himself. A majority of Trump supporters (55%) have mixed feelings about the way he conducts himself, while 15% don\u2019t like his conduct. Biden supporters express much more positive views about their candidate\u2019s conduct. Nearly six-in-ten (59%) like the way he conducts himself.\n\nBiden\u2019s ratings decline for mental sharpness and remain consistent for honesty. Only about half as many voters describe Biden as mentally sharp today (24%) as did so in October 2020 (46%), during the final month of that campaign. His ratings for mental sharpness have declined throughout his presidency. In April 2023, a third of voters said he was mentally sharp.\n\nTrump\u2019s ratings for mental sharpness are higher today than they were in 2020 (58% now, 50% then). By contrast, Biden\u2019s rating on honesty \u2013 currently 48% \u2013 is identical to his rating in 2020. The share describing Trump as honest also is little changed (36% now, 36% then).\n\nBiden\u2019s job approval among the general public: Roughly a third of Americans (32%) approve of Biden\u2019s job performance. His job rating has fluctuated modestly over the course of this year. The current measure is 3 points lower than in April and roughly the same as in January (33%). Since April, Biden\u2019s job rating has declined 4 points among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (from 65% to 61%). Just 5% of Republicans and Republican leaners approve, which is little changed over the past year.

        "text": "How Trump's Proposed Radical Expansion of Executive Power Will Impact Our Freedoms\nA second Trump administration threatens to use executive authority to further limit First Amendment freedoms, surveil Americans and undermine democracy.\n\nThis piece was published before Joe Biden withdrew from the 2024 presidential election and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to represent the Democratic Party. No significant facts have been changed or added. Donald Trump\u2019s four years in office were marked by gross abuses of executive power, including efforts to trample protest and dissent \u2014 key freedoms at the heart of our participatory democracy. He deployed federal agents and surveillance to silence Black Lives Matter protesters or anyone he deemed to oppose his policies, threatened to use his power as president to punish his political enemies, and attacked journalists who criticized him. If elected to a second term, we expect the Trump administration to double down on attempts to further limit our First Amendment rights and use the power of the federal government to attack political rivals, stifle dissent, and undermine checks and balances on presidential power. For more than 100 years, the ACLU has defended our most fundamental rights and freedoms \u2014 including our right to express ourselves free from government interference. We won\u2019t stop now. If Trump is reelected, we\u2019re prepared to use the courts, Congress, state and local power, and our organizing muscle to challenge unlawful attempts to surveil Americans, suppress speech, and undermine democracy. Learn more in our breakdown:\n\nTrump on Surveillance, Protest, & Free Speech\n\nThe Facts: In 2020, the Trump administration threatened to use force to quell protests, and actually did deploy federal agents and National Guard troops who arrested and used excessive force against protestors and journalists. If Trump secures a second term, this abuse of power is likely to recur and even escalate. Trump has already indicated that his administration would consider invoking the Insurrection Act to deploy the military to America\u2019s cities \u2014 potentially targeting those with large BIPOC and immigrant communities \u2014 to suppress the right to protest. Trump has also indicated that his administration would attack online free expression by forcing media companies and online platforms to carry conservatives\u2019 preferred speech. As president, with federal law enforcement agencies under his control, Trump could carry out attacks on advocacy organizations and individuals he opposes. Indeed, on the campaign trail, Trump has praised violent crackdowns on campus protests, aligning with his previous attacks on academic freedom. In particular, he has threatened to deport student protestors who are not U.S. citizens, merging his attacks on free speech with his attacks on immigration. We also expect Trump to use his authority to further target media members and the freedom of the press to suppress negative stories about him or his administration. Furthermore, Project 2025 has made clear that a second Trump administration intends to dismantle the already insufficient guardrails that prevent the president from abusing the executive branch\u2019s power. The Supreme Court already removed one such guardrail in Trump v. United States, ruling that the president cannot be criminally prosecuted for \u201cofficial acts,\u201d including using the Justice Department for his personal and political bidding. Trump can use a politicized Justice Department and the vast array of federal agencies to attack voters, protestors, journalists, abortion care providers and patients, his political opponents and any others he perceives as \u201cenemies.\u201d Even now, Trump allies in Congress are trying to use their investigative tools to chill free speech, including targeting civil society organizations and activists engaged in protected advocacy, such as opposing the war in Gaza or supporting LGBTQ rights. The dangers of the federal government targeting its opponents and vulnerable populations are multiplied by mass surveillance mechanisms that the ACLU has long fought to constrain. A second Trump administration could leverage surveillance programs such as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which authorizes the collection of communications between U.S. persons and people outside the United States, and which Congress has dangerously expanded to allow the government to search Americans\u2019 private communications and information without a warrant and without notice. Why It Matters: By punishing political enemies and stifling protest and dissent, a second Trump administration would break many of the checks and balances on the executive branch, and undermine the foundations of a functioning democracy. A second Trump administration will also pose a threat to our historic American tradition of robust, open political competition marked by spirited dissent and the foundational notion that the people have the final say.\n\nTrump on Surveillance, Protest, and Free Speech Though Donald Trump has threatened to abuse executive power if reelected, the ACLU will push leaders to champion civil rights and civil liberties.\n\nSource: American Civil Liberties Union",

In Joe Biden \u2019s case, a victory in three key swing states will be sufficient to ensure his return to the White House. This is according to John Ellis who is a political analyst. This has been reported by the Daily Express. This may renew Biden\u2019s campaign amidst a sense of despondency which had gripped the Democrats after the first presidential debate. There are also concerns pertaining to Biden\u2019s health. These concerns have prompted many of the legislators who have called on Biden to stand down and pave the way for another candidate from the Democrats to contest the upcoming presidential election John Ellis who is a well- known political analyst and founder of News Items said that there is only way in which Biden can beat Trump in the upcoming election . He added that if the election is about inflation, immigration and Biden\u2019s health concerns; Trump\u2019s victory is assured. On the other hand, if the issue is about abortion rights and Trump\u2019s views on the topic, Biden may win easily.He added that Biden is presently disadvantaged as the main electoral issue is that of his health and questions being raised regarding his continuation in office. Under these conditions, he can only win the election if he is able to convincingly win three critical swing states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.Presently, Biden is trailing in many of these swing states. According to the poll conducted by the Emerson College which has been sponsored by the Democrats, Biden is trailing behind Trump by at least four percentage point in six key swing states of Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona, Wisconsin and Nevada.In other national surveys, Biden is trailing behind Trump by six percentage points. The first presidential debate was disastrous for Biden. There are growing calls for his ouster from the ballot. There have been various calls to replace him on ballot box.Various national surveys which reflected a hypothetical competition between Trump and Michelle Obama reveals that the former first lady is leading by 11% against the former president. However, she has refused to contest the election.Joe Biden has still not decided to step down as the official presidential nominee of the party. If he does intend to step down, the other probable candidates are VP Kamala Harris, California Governor Gavin Newsom.",

        "text": "More Democrats call on Biden to step aside from 2024 race after his news conference\nAt least three more House Democrats called on President Joe Biden to withdraw from the presidential race Thursday after his first solo news conference in months following the NATO summit.\n\nEven though Biden\u2019s team felt optimistic about his performance, it remained unclear whether he did enough to repair the damage with members of his party who worry he no longer has what it takes to defeat Donald Trump and be effective for another four years.\n\nRep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., praised Biden as \u201ca remarkable leader of unparalleled public service\u201d but said it\u2019s time to go.\n\n\u201cThe 2024 election will define the future of American democracy, and we must put forth the strongest candidate possible to confront the threat posed by Trump\u2019s promised MAGA authoritarianism,\u201d Himes said in a statement. \u201cI no longer believe that is Joe Biden, and I hope that, as he has throughout a lifetime of public service, he will continue to put our nation first and, as he promised, make way for a new generation of leaders.\u201d\n\nBiden was asked about that promise during Thursday\u2019s news conference and said he needed to \u201cfinish\u201d the job he was given, arguing that he hadn\u2019t realized \u201cthe gravity of the situation I inherited in terms of the economy, our foreign policy and domestic division\" before he entered office.\n\nRep. Scott Peters, D-Calif., said in his own post-news conference statement that Biden\u2019s debate performance last month was \u201cnot a blip\u201d and that swing state polls have \u201cworsened alarmingly\u201d since then.\n\nPresident Biden during his press conference at the NATO Summit in Washington on Thursday. Artem Priakhin / SOPA Images via Reuters\n\n\u201cToday I ask President Biden to withdraw from the presidential campaign. The stakes are high, and we are on a losing course. My conscience requires me to speak up and put loyalty to the country and to democracy ahead of my great affection for, and loyalty to, the President and those around him,\u201d Peters said in a statement. \u201cWe must find a candidate from our deep bench of talent who can defeat Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nRep. Eric Sorensen, D-Ill., who is running for re-election in a competitive district in November, said he is \u201chopeful President Biden will step aside in his campaign for President\u201d and be replaced with \u201ca candidate for President who will communicate a positive vision for every person in this country.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn 2020, Joe Biden ran for President with the purpose of putting country over party. Today, I am asking him to do that again,\u201d Sorensen said in a statement.\n\nBut despite the new opposition, Biden\u2019s team felt good about his news conference and confident that it could stem the defections and reassure Democratic skeptics.\n\nA source in Biden\u2019s orbit said the news conference should comfort open-minded skeptics who had legitimate questions after the debate about Biden\u2019s ability to battle Trump, offer a second-term vision and lay out his contrasts with Trump on Project 2025, abortion rights, gun safety legislation and a fairer economic system.\n\nBiden world believes he stuck the landing, the source said.\n\nBut a Democratic official, who was forbidden from speaking publicly about the political dynamics of Biden\u2019s news conference, said he \u201cdid not do anything to reassure Democrats that he understands how dire his political situation is or that he has a realistic plan to win.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe seemed most comfortable talking about foreign policy issues like NATO, issues that swing voters in battleground states do not care about \u2014 at all,\u201d the Democratic official said. \u201cHe also had no message for the future. The case he presented for re-election was all about achievements from two years ago.\u201d\n\nWith the presidential nominating conventions approaching, a Democratic leadership aide said time is running out to sustain the intraparty fighting.\n\n\u201cThe week after next when [lawmakers] are back is the final make-or-break moment,\u201d the source said. \u201cIf Biden stays in at that point, we have to rally around him.\u201d",

        "text": "US House approves bill to ban non-citizens from voting in federal elections\nThe Republican-controlled US House of Representatives, fueled by Donald Trump\u2019s false claims about election fraud, approved a bill on Wednesday that would ban non-citizens from registering to vote in federal elections, a rare practice that is already illegal.\n\nLess than four months before Trump\u2019s 5 November election showdown with Democratic president Joe Biden, the House voted 221-198 to approval the measure, which is based on claims that people who have crossed the US-Mexico border illegally could cast ballots in this year\u2019s presidential and congressional elections.\n\nThe legislation now goes to the Democratic-led Senate, where it is likely to be dead on arrival.\n\nTitled the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, the bill would require those registering to vote to provide proof of US citizenship and compel states to purge suspected non-citizens from their voter rolls.\n\nIt is already a felony offense for a non-citizen to vote in a federal election, and independent studies have shown that such things happen only rarely.\n\nThe bill is opposed by Democrats, who describe it as a voter suppression effort targeted at key Democratic constituencies with a Trump-inspired message calculated to undermine overall public confidence in the US election system.\n\n\u201cThis bill would do nothing to safeguard our elections,\u201d the White House said in a statement this week. \u201cBut it would make it much harder for all eligible Americans to register to vote and increase the risk that eligible voters are purged from voter rolls.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have couched the bill in Trump-like apocalyptic rhetoric.\n\nThe House speaker, Mike Johnson, claimed in a floor speech ahead of the vote that failure to support the bill would \u201chand over our country to illegal aliens, cartel traffickers, and violent criminals and murderers\u201d.\n\nTrump, who favors the bill, continues to repeat false claims that the 2020 election was stolen through major voter fraud.\n\nJohnson, who relied on Trump\u2019s support to hold off a bid to oust him from leadership by Republican hardliner Marjorie Taylor Greene, unveiled plans for the legislation during an April joint press conference with the former president in Florida.\n\nJohnson and other Republicans have gone so far as to allege that Democrats are actively encouraging non-citizens to vote.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Trump used the study to support his claim that Democrat Hillary Clinton won the popular vote in the 2016 presidential election because of illegal ballots cast by non-citizens.\n\n\u201cThis is a scare tactic,\u201d said Wendy Weiser, who directs the democracy program at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. \u201cNon-citizens cannot vote in US elections. There are multiple layers of protections in place, including it being a crime under federal and state law.\u201d\n\nA Brennan Center study examined 42 jurisdictions, accounting for 23.5m votes in the 2016 presidential election, and found only 30 incidents of possible non-citizen voting, or 0.0001% of votes cast.",

You can thank the Founding Fathers\n\ntoggle caption Carolyn Kaster/AP\n\nOver the past two weeks, President Biden has been pilloried from all sides for his performance during the recent CNN presidential debate, perceived by many as weak and halting. And as his subsequent public appearances have done little to slow calls for him to bow out of the presidential race, a question has been on many voters' minds: Is it possible to be too old to be president?\n\nBiden and former President Donald Trump are the two oldest major-party candidates whom voters have ever encountered on their ballots. If Biden wins the election, he'll be 82 come Inauguration Day. Trump would be 78.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nLoading...\n\nAnd while age and mental acuity have a complicated relationship, the candidates' ages have affected voters' perceptions of how well they'd be able to do their jobs.\n\nThat was the case even before the debate: Only 15% of voters were at least \"very confident\" that Biden had the physical fitness required to be president, and 21% felt similarly about his mental fitness, according to an April Pew Research Center report. (Trump fared better, with 36% expressing that level of confidence in his physical fitness and 38% in his mental ability.)\n\ntoggle caption Mark Ralston/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe Founding Fathers certainly thought about presidential age centuries ago: It's baked into Article 2 of the U.S. Constitution, which requires that, among other things, a president be at least 35 years old. But while there's a limit on how young one can be to assume the office, there has never been a rule about how old a president could be.\n\nToday, nearly 80% of U.S. adults surveyed support having upper age limits for federal elected officials, including the president, according to Pew. But such a limit would have never occurred to the architects of the U.S. government in the 18th century, constitutional experts say, and there are huge barriers to those rules changing anytime soon.\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAge was but a number at the Constitutional Convention\n\nThe 1787 Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia was full of intense debates that shaped the Constitution and are memorable even now. It's easy to assume that the age requirement was similarly the product of a lot of time and deliberation. But that wasn't necessarily the case. After all, the Founders were busy constructing an entire government from scratch, says Julian Davis Mortenson, a constitutional law professor at the University of Michigan.\n\n\"There was literally an infinite array of things they had to resolve,\" he says. Case in point: Should there be an executive branch in the first place? Would there be one single president or multiple leaders? And how would they be chosen?\n\n\"And there's only so much bandwidth even over the course of a four- or five-month drafting process. Some of the things they thought about, they thought about a lot. And some of the things just didn't really come up.\"\n\nWhen the Founding Fathers settled on the idea of a single, powerful executive, it was clear that the role required someone trustworthy and capable enough to take up the mantle, Mortenson says.\n\nSo how to screen for that? The Founders came up with formal requirements that, in their minds, correlated with those qualities, says Buckner F. Melton Jr., a history professor at Middle Georgia State University. They'd have to be a resident of the U.S. for at least 14 years to ensure they were familiar with the laws and customs of the country, and they'd have to be a natural-born citizen to protect the presidency from outside influence.\n\nA minimum age limit was put into place because \"age was the best corollary they had for sound judgment, maturity and what we might refer to as wisdom,\" Melton says. And they picked 35 \u2014 slightly higher than the Senate requirement (30) and the House (25).\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSo if there was a floor, why wasn't there a ceiling? According to all the convention documentation, the idea wasn't floated at all, Melton says. He has a theory as to why: Life spans were much shorter back in that part of the 18th century, so the idea that someone could be in political office at an age when they might not be at their peak mental fitness probably did not occur to the Founders.\n\n\n\nPresidential age and mental capacity became increasingly relevant\n\nAs time went on, industrial-era medical advances like antibiotics and antiseptics meant that people tended to die later than they once did, Melton says. And as presidents started to live longer \u2014 and to have disabling medical emergencies \u2014 the question of capacity to serve started to emerge.\n\ntoggle caption Topical Press Agency/Getty Images/Hulton Archive\n\nPresident Woodrow Wilson, who had a stroke in 1919 at age 63 that \"seriously compromised\" his ability to work, became emblematic of that concern, Melton says. For the next year and a half of his presidency, Wilson was mostly bedridden, and his wife, Edith Wilson, and doctors played a large role in helping him with his presidential duties \u2014 all while the public was mostly left in the dark. (The extent to which they were assisting him with his presidential duties is the subject of some debate. Although Edith Wilson said in her autobiography that she \"never made a single decision regarding the disposition of public affairs,\" most historians agree she had a heavy hand in his decision-making.)\n\nIt became clear to those in Wilson's Cabinet that he wouldn't step aside from the role to let someone else, even his vice president, assume office, Mortenson says. And there wasn't much that anyone could do about it \u2014 after all, the Constitution mentioned what would happen when presidents died but not what would happen when their ability to serve became greatly diminished.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe question would continue to arise over the decades to come, particularly when President Franklin D. Roosevelt's health declined precipitously before he died in office in 1945, at age 63, and when President Dwight Eisenhower experienced a heart attack and other serious illnesses in the 1950s. But things reached a tipping point in 1963, when President John F. Kennedy was assassinated and Lyndon B. Johnson was sworn into office. There were concerns about the hardiness of the line of succession: At the time of the assassination, Johnson had experienced a near-fatal heart attack years earlier, and the speaker of the House and the president pro tempore of the Senate were 71 and 86, respectively.\n\ntoggle caption National Archives/Getty Images/Hulton Archive\n\n\"Once you have experience with concrete, real-world events prompting worry about something like what happens when the president can't do his job, you get political responses,\" Mortenson says. The response this time: the 25th Amendment, ratified by the states and adopted in 1967.\n\nAmong other things, the 25th Amendment lays out how a vice president would take over for a president unable to perform official duties. It also specifies the process through which a president unable to fulfill duties could be removed from office by the vice president, a majority of the Cabinet and a supermajority of Congress.\n\nThe removal portion of the amendment has never been invoked \u2014 even though this had reportedly been considered by at least some of President Ronald Reagan's advisers during his second term due to his alleged declining mental state. (He announced his diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in 1994, five years after he left the presidency. At the time, he was the oldest president to leave the Oval Office, at 77 years.) The matter was also raised in the wake of the Jan. 6 insurrection; Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Democrats from the House Judiciary Committee called for then-Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to strip Trump of his powers.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut this amendment is the closest we've come to politically addressing concerns about a president's age and mental faculties, Mortenson says.\n\n\n\nWhat would it take to install a presidential age limit?\n\nEven though polls show widespread support for age limits, the obstacles to changing the requirements for becoming the president are considerable. For a rule change to stand up in courts, the Constitution itself would need to be amended, Mortensen says.\n\nThe bar for passing an amendment is notoriously high \u2014 it needs to clear a two-thirds vote in the House and Senate, or two-thirds of the states can petition Congress to call a constitutional convention. From there, three-fourths of the country's state legislatures must ratify the amendment for it to become a part of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nIt seems unlikely that Congress would be amenable to making any changes to the presidential age requirement, Melton says, because serving as a representative or senator is often a stepping stone to the presidency.\n\n\"If Congress is going to be reluctant to impose age limits because they may see themselves as cutting themselves off from the White House by doing this, then a convention of the states will be the only way out,\" he says. \"And Congress has shown in the past that it is perfectly willing to throw up roadblocks to that process.\"\n\nIt's not just a question of politics \u2014 it's also a matter of neuroscience. There's the most basic question: What would the limit be? There's not one set age at which a person's cognitive abilities decline, and some people don't decline much at all. Alternatively, others \u2014 including Reagan's daughter \u2014 have proposed using some kind of cognitive test as a gauge.\n\n\"We would need to have to come up with some sort of good, empirical, verifiable, reliable tests on which there's a really good, strong consensus to decide when someone would be too old,\" Melton says. \"The other thing you could do, of course, is just go with a bright line and say, after age 70, that's it. We do that with retirements. Why not with the White House?\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWhatever the fix, voters seem to have come to a sort of consensus, he says. \"While the country is horribly divided right now \u2026 there is a type of weird uniformity where everyone realizes, whatever your politics are, a presidential candidate can be too old.\"",

        "text": "George Clooney calls for Joe Biden to quit presidential race\nTop Democratic fundraiser Clooney calls on Biden to drop out\n\nGetty Images Clooney said the Democrats will not win in November with Mr Biden\n\nGeorge Clooney has issued a damning call for Joe Biden to quit the US presidential race, hours after senior Democrat Nancy Pelosi swerved questions about whether he should continue. The actor and prominent Democratic fundraiser said the president had won many battles in his career, \"but the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time\". Another Hollywood star and fundraiser, Michael Douglas, later told the BBC he was \"worried\" about Mr Biden's electoral chances. The president has stated, repeatedly, that he is determined to remain as the Democratic party's candidate and beat Donald Trump, 78, in November. The celebrities' comments came after Mrs Pelosi, the former House Speaker, joined growing disquiet in the party, saying time was \"running short\" for Mr Biden, 81, to decide whether to stay in the race after his stumbling debate against Trump. Clooney wrote in the New York Times that it was \"devastating to say it\", but the Joe Biden he met at a fundraising event three weeks ago was not the Biden of 2010. \"He wasn\u2019t even the Joe Biden of 2020,\" added the actor. \"He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,\" Clooney said. The fundraising event, co-hosted by Clooney in Los Angeles and also featuring Julia Roberts and Barbra Streisand, brought in a single-night record of roughly $30m (\u00a323m) for the Biden campaign. The Biden camp has hit back at the Hollywood star, with an unnamed source telling US media: \u201cThe President stayed for over 3 hours [at the fundraiser], while Clooney took a photo quickly and left.\u201d The president's campaign also pointed out that when he attended the fundraiser he had just arrived in Los Angeles from Italy, where he had been at the G7 summit.\n\nIn his op-ed, Clooney wrote: \"Our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn\u2019t see what we just saw.\" \"This is about age. Nothing more,\" he continued. \"We are not going to win in November with this president.\" Clooney added that his concerns matched those of \"every\" member of Congress with whom he had spoken. In his own comments, Michael Douglas said he had concerns about Mr Biden's capabilities during a potential second term: \"I am worried not this week or next week, but let's say next year.\" The actor said he had held a fundraiser in April for Mr Biden, who he believed had done an \"incredible job\". But, citing the debate with Trump, he said it was important for a candidate to be \"articulate\" during such a \"combative\" political era. Asked to respond to Clooney, Mr Biden's campaign referred to a letter the president sent Democrats in Congress that said he was \"firmly committed\" to his candidacy and beating Trump. Yet public dissent continues to grow within Mr Biden's party as he faces scrutiny while hosting the Nato summit in Washington.\n\nNancy Pelosi says it's the president's decision to continue\n\nMrs Pelosi, a highly influential voice among Capitol Hill Democrats, on Wednesday appeared to disregard Mr Biden's insistence that he was determined to forge on. When asked if he should stay in the election race, she told MSNBC's Morning Joe: \"I want him to do whatever he decides to do. \"It's up to the president to decide if he's going to run. We are all encouraging him to make that decision, because time is running short.\" Acknowledging the demands on the president during the Nato summit, Mrs Pelosi told MSNBC: \"I said to everyone - let's just hold off. \"Whatever you're thinking, either tell somebody privately, but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week. But I am very proud of the president.\" Around a dozen elected Democrats have suggested he abandon his campaign since his 27 June debate with Trump. On Tuesday night, Michael Bennet of Colorado became the first Democratic senator to publicly dissent. Although he did not call for Mr Biden to quit outright, he said Trump would win the election, possibly by a \"landslide\". On Wednesday afternoon, Peter Welch of Vermont became the first Senate Democrat to openly call on Mr Biden to withdraw, \"for the good of the country\", as he wrote in a Washington Post op-ed. He was joined by the eighth and ninth congressional Democrats to make similar calls: Pat Ryan from New York and Earl Blumenauer from Oregon. The Biden campaign repeated the president's statement that he was \"running this race to the end\". Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries plans to speak to Mr Biden by Friday to discuss the concerns brought by several congressional party members. Overall support from elected Democrats remains robust, however. Gavin Newsom, the California governor who was named by Clooney as a potential replacement, said he was still \u201call in\u201d with Mr Biden. The Congressional Black Caucus, a group of roughly 60 politicians, and progressive House members like Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, have publicly backed Mr Biden. On Tuesday, Chuck Schumer, the leading Democrat in the Senate, said: \"I'm with Joe.\" Axios, however, reports that Mr Schumer has been privately telling donors he is open to dumping Mr Biden. Two unnamed senior Democrats, speaking to CBS News, the BBC's US partner, said there had been a \"convergence\" of opinion over the last 24 hours between elected Democrats, donors and groups that support the president's party. One of the sources said all of the interests have reached \u201ca near consensus\u201d about what Mr Biden should do. Questions about the Democrat's campaign were also swirling at the Nato summit in Washington DC.\n\nBiden ignores questions from reporters during meeting with Starmer",

        "text": "When Biden can be replaced on the 2024 ballot\nPresident Joe Biden at the June 27 debate against Donald Trump in Atlanta. The first presidential debate of the 2024 general election set off a seemingly unending round of questions and speculation over whether Biden will remain the Democratic nominee.\n\nThis news analysis first appeared in Votebeat\u2019s free weekly newsletter. Sign up to get the latest reporting from Votebeat and curated news from other publications, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.\n\nSince President Joe Biden\u2019s poor performance in the first presidential debate, the speculation and arguments about whether he will remain the Democratic nominee for president have been unending. And big questions continue to swirl about what happens if he doesn\u2019t. Can he still be replaced on the November ballot despite locking up thousands of delegates in the Democratic primaries? Who would take his place? What would that require? And when must everything be decided?\n\nMy head hurts. Yours might, too. I will try to make some sense of the various answers.\n\nOther news media so far have amply covered the question of how, under the Democratic Party\u2019s rules, Biden could be replaced before the convention (highly doable, if he hands the campaign over to Vice President Kamala Harris) or at the convention (very unlikely, unless he willingly exits). As always, the party is entitled to choose its nominee by its own processes, though it\u2019s hard to imagine a scenario where it chooses someone other than Biden if he doesn\u2019t voluntarily step aside.\n\nBut looking deeper into the world of elections, we still wanted to know: How late is too late to replace Biden\u2019s name on the ballot?\n\nThe answer, as with most things in election administration, is that it depends on the state. It\u2019s hard to point to a single clear deadline, but one thing is clear: The logistics of replacing Biden on the ballot become harder the longer the party waits.\n\nThe conservative Heritage Foundation has announced it will sue if Democrats replace Biden. Several experts have said that if the switch happens soon, such a suit would have little chance of success: Biden isn\u2019t the official nominee until after the convention, and there\u2019s nothing stopping the delegates there from selecting someone else.\n\nEvery state\u2019s deadline, and the basis for that deadline, is a little bit different, but Richard Hasen, a professor of law at UCLA and the director of the Safeguarding Democracy Project, says \u201cthe official nomination\u201d is the key trigger. The Democratic Party\u2019s convention concludes on Aug. 22, which leaves the party with a few weeks to consider its choice.\n\nIf Biden were to step away after the nomination, Democrats must \u201cturn to the rules that apply for when a vacancy exists,\u201d Hasen said. \u201cAnd it gets dicey.\u201d\n\nWhile there\u2019s some precedent in a few states for late changes to ballots, they do have to be proofread and printed, and there are hard deadlines to get that process done in time for the election. That means \u201cthere is a point where it\u2019s too late, and then the question is how you count the votes cast for Biden,\u201d Hasen said.\n\nIn other words, at some point, Biden\u2019s name simply has to go on the ballot as the Democratic candidate. Even in states without mail voting, ballots for overseas and military voters go out weeks in advance of Election Day. Once they are printed, there\u2019s really no changing them.\n\nIf Biden withdraws after the ballots are printed, and Democrats name a replacement who would receive the votes cast in his name \u2014 that\u2019s what\u2019s happened in past instances when candidates for other offices have withdrawn or died late in the process \u2014 the Electoral College could come into play.\n\nWhen we cast our votes for president, after all, we aren\u2019t really voting for the candidate. We are voting for a slate of electors pledged to that candidate. In states that allow it, those electors could plausibly choose someone other than Biden even if \u201cJoseph R. Biden Jr.\u201d is the name on the ballot.\n\nBut given recent scandals over electors trying to cast ballots for someone other than the chosen candidate, this comes with its own set of potential issues.\n\nTo illustrate the slight differences among states, I asked our reporters to figure out how this would work in the states they cover, most of which are highly contested swing states. Here\u2019s what we know:\n\nArizona: A spokesperson for the Arizona secretary of state said the office would permit a new presidential candidate until Aug. 30, a date he said was a bipartisan consensus. But the answer may vary by county. Maricopa County says that its ballots need to be finalized by Aug. 22. The state doesn\u2019t bar electors from casting their ballot for someone other than the nominee.\n\nA spokesperson for the Arizona secretary of state said the office would permit a new presidential candidate until Aug. 30, a date he said was a bipartisan consensus.

Michigan: A spokesperson for the secretary of state\u2019s office said that the names on the ballots are those chosen by party conventions, and this step must be done \u201cno later than 60 days before the election so ballots can be delivered to military and overseas civilians 45 days before the election.\u201d The state requires electors to cast their ballots \u201cfor President and Vice President appearing on the Michigan ballot.\u201d Electors who do not follow that requirement are disqualified and replaced.\n\nA spokesperson for the secretary of state\u2019s office said that the names on the ballots are those chosen by party conventions, and this step must be done \u201cno later than 60 days before the election so ballots can be delivered to military and overseas civilians 45 days before the election.\u201d The state requires electors to cast their ballots \u201cfor President and Vice President appearing on the Michigan ballot.\u201d Electors who do not follow that requirement are disqualified and replaced. Pennsylvania: The secretary of state\u2019s spokesperson told us that Pennsylvania law has few legal restrictions on when presidential candidates are finalized for the ballot, but that doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t necessary time limits. The state\u2019s election calendar shows that the state must notify counties of the names of candidates no later than Aug. 27. As in the rest of the country, military ballots would go out shortly after. The deadline for printing and sending mailed ballots to voters who requested them is Oct. 22.

Texas: Counties manage the printing of their own ballots, and include the names of the candidates given to them by the secretary of state. That office sends those names in late August, after the conventions. Military ballots, though, go out on Sept. 21, and must be printed days ahead of that. Trudy Hancock, the election administrator in Brazos County, told us the county\u2019s ballots are typically finished by Sept. 10 to allow for proofing and to account for any delays. A 2023 update to Texas\u2019s election code requires electors to sign an oath that they will vote for the chosen candidate. Those who defy the oath are replaced.\n\nCounties manage the printing of their own ballots, and include the names of the candidates given to them by the secretary of state.

Wisconsin: State law requires that electors cast their ballots for the candidate of the party that nominated them unless that candidate is dead. In a memo, the Wisconsin Election Commission made clear those names would be certified by the major political party state or national chairs to the Wisconsin Elections Commission \u201cno later than 5:00 p.m. on Tuesday, September 3, 2024.\u201d All ballots are distributed to municipal clerks by Sept. 18.\n\nOf course, as the Heritage Foundation has already made clear, Republicans would make replacing Biden on the ballot as challenging and expensive as possible. In addition to the lawsuits Heritage is threatening to file, there are some signs that lawyers are looking to campaign finance law as grounds for a challenge.\n\nDemocrats must consider what would become of the tens of millions of dollars the Biden campaign has raised. The consensus among many campaign finance lawyers is that the money cannot legally be transferred directly to a replacement presidential nominee \u2014 unless that candidate is Harris.\n\nGet more like this delivered to your inbox.

The promise by such political heavy-hitters to challenge any transfer before that suggests Republicans see it as advantageous to delay a replacement, as the election administration logistics grow more challenging.\n\nIt might seem frustrating that a debate about replacing the nominee is happening in only one party, when the other party\u2019s presumptive nominee, Donald Trump, is a twice-impeached convicted felon facing multiple other indictments, including for allegedly trying to subvert the democratic process through fraud. Questions about a candidate\u2019s fitness for office also apply to him.\n\nRepublicans did have a conversation \u2014 both quietly and in public \u2014 about replacing Trump as the nominee in 2016, when the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape went public. But after his victory that year, and his sweep of the primaries this year, Republicans aren\u2019t seriously having that conversation now. Democrats, for better or worse, are having this conversation, and out loud.\n\nAs of this week, Biden is insisting he will remain in the race, though intraparty pressure on him to exit is growing rapidly. None of the scenarios we\u2019re talking about may come to pass. But if they do, we\u2019ll be writing about what comes next and what it means.\n\nJessica Huseman is Votebeat\u2019s editorial director and is based in Dallas.

        "text": "Explainer: Venezuela's 2024 Presidential Elections\nThe big question for Venezuela\u2019s July 28 elections may not be who voters prefer but whether their preference will be respected.\n\nThe previous presidential election, which took place in 2018, was marked by irregularities. The reelection of Nic\u00f3las Maduro was considered illegitimate by the EU and countries around the world. Now, Maduro is seeking to extend his already decade-long reign with another six-year term. But will this race be free and fair?\n\nThe fact that Venezuelans will even have the chance to go to the polls was not a given just a few months ago. The framework for this election was established in through the Barbados Accords, signed in October 2023 by the Maduro government and an alliance of opposition parties known as the Unitary Platform. The agreement set out conditions for the election, including that it must take place in the second half of this year, electoral reforms must be made, and international observation must be allowed. It also covered guarantees for the opposition\u2019s participation and primary election process. The United States, which was not party to the accords, agreed to drop some sanctions to get Maduro to stick to his Barbados pledges.\n\nA few conditions have been met. The opposition did have its primary in October 2023. And, Maduro set the date for July 28\u2014his deceased predecessor Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s birthday, marking a date that is early but within the promised range. But other promises have been violated, with one key example being the January disqualification of presidential candidate Maria Corina Machado, who won the opposition primary with 93 percent of the vote. This prompted international outcry and the resumption of some sanctions.\n\nNow, the Unitary Platform has a new candidate, former diplomat Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia, and polls suggest he has a commanding lead of as much as 50 points over Maduro. What is Gonz\u00e1lez proposing? And how might Maduro undercut his rivals?\n\nAS/COA Online covers the electoral context and the candidates.",

        "text": "US presidential election aftermath\nALLIES and supporters of the United States who praise it as the champion of democracy, freedom and human rights will now be rushing to join the media queue to congratulate the incoming president.\n\nIn their public messaging, they are likely to extol the outcome as yet another example of American exceptionalism and a role model for the countries of the world they regard as autocratic and necessary to bring down to uphold their definition of democracy and the Western rule of law.\n\nPrivately though, they will be feeling and reacting differently. They are also likely to be afraid of what will now follow.\n\nThe explanation is not far to find. Though portrayed in Western media as offering vastly different visions of the US for the next four years as well as being diametrically opposed in their foreign policy objectives, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump concur in adherence to the slogan made famous by Trump: that is to \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d (Maga).\n\nIt is a slogan that Democrat party leaders embrace just as strongly but would rather not\n\nlet the rest of the world be aware of or knowledgeable about.\n\nHow will Maga impact US foreign policy?\n\nPost-election, the Maga agenda will be pushed hard and at the expense of the interests and concerns of the rest of the world. Maga foreign policy impact will be felt not only by countries that the US sees as rivals and enemies \u2013 China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, Cuba, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Serbia, Venezuela, Belarus and others.\n\nIt will also inflict costs on allies including Canada, European Union nations, Ukraine, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, and a few others such as the Philippines, previously provided with generous financial and military support by a moneyed and powerful benefactor, which is now relatively impoverished and less influential.\n\nCountries not hitched to the American ideological bandwagon that see themselves as independent such as Mexico, India and Vietnam will find that sitting on the fence in the next four years will be much less comfortable as the new US president will not shield or spare them from the looming policy changes in trade, immigration, security, climate change and wherever else he or she sees as important and necessary to uplift the US and stem its decline.\n\nEarlier in July, The Economist drew up a table ranking the vulnerability of various countries likely to be impacted by a new Trump presidency\u2019s core policies. The table, The Trump Risk Index, assessed the exposure and vulnerability of America\u2019s 70 largest trading partners to potential policy changes.\n\nAlthough no similar table was drawn up for a Harris presidency, if one were to be drawn up, it is likely that there will be little or no difference in the index finding and ranking.\n\nIncreasingly, we find that liberal and conservative American analysts \u2013 both now recognising that the US is in an existential crisis \u2013 are converging in support of Maga to be the focus of US foreign policy.\n\nThe crisis, a long-developing one, exposes not only the deep divisions within American society with equal numbers on Republican and Democrat sides of the political fence in disagreement on the domestic policy reforms that the country badly needs.\n\nIt also brings to attention the current status of the US described by Trump as \u201ca failing country\u201d. It is a description that some Americans have taken umbrage with but which many Democrat supporters agree on while denouncing the Republican and Trumpian rhetoric and record on failing to improve the state of the nation.\n\nWhat is perhaps most unsettling is that the disorder and instability in the US may see the new president become more reliant on US military superiority to ensure American dominance in global geopolitics.\n\nThe US military may again be called upon to underpin the foreign policy actions needed to make America great again.\n\nIs a last hurrah coming to ensure that the US continues its defence of the unipolar world that it has shaped and is fixated on preserving?\n\nLim Teck Ghee\u2019s Another Take is aimed at demystifying social orthodoxy.\n\nComments: letters@thesundaily.com",

That\u2019s even as Biden continues to run evenly with Donald Trump, with no meaningful post-debate change in vote preferences.\n\nAmericans divide 46-47% between Biden and Trump if the election were today, almost identical to a 44-46% ABC/Ipsos poll result in April. Among registered voters (though there\u2019s plenty of time to register) it\u2019s an absolute tie, 46-46%.\n\nWere Vice President Kamala Harris to replace Biden as the Democratic nominee, vote choices are 49-46%, Harris-Trump, among all adults (and 49-47% among registered voters). Harris\u2019 49% is slightly better than Biden\u2019s 46%, although she doesn\u2019t have a statistically significant lead over Trump.\n\nVote preference between Joe Biden / Donald Trump now, and in Apr. 2024, and Kamal Harris / Donald Trump in Apr. 2024 ABC News / Washington Post / Ipsos and ABC News / Ipsos polls\n\nSee PDF for full results.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean Biden didn\u2019t take on damage from the debate. Sixty-seven percent overall say he should withdraw from the race. More, 85% now say he is too old for a second term, a new high, up from an already-broad 81% in April and 68% just more than a year ago.\n\nToo Old for a Second Term? ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll\n\nFurther, the poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates with fieldwork by Ipsos, finds Trump leading Biden by 30 percentage points, 44%-14%, in being seen as having the mental sharpness it takes to serve effectively as president. Trump's lead is about as wide in being seen as having the physical health to serve, and his advantages on both have widened since April.\n\nAs the horse race shows, those views may not be determinative. Biden's job approval rating is stable, albeit at a weak 36%. Though neither is broadly popular, Biden continues to have a better personal favorability rating than Trump. And Biden leads Trump by 17 points, 39%-22%, in being seen as more honest and trustworthy, essentially unchanged from the spring.\n\nBoth candidates face a high degree of scorn. About 4 in 10 Americans say neither has the mental sharpness or the physical health to serve effectively, and as many say neither is honest and trustworthy. Sixty percent say Trump is too old for a second term, also a new high, up from 44% in spring 2023. And in a sign of the nation's political polarization, 50% say that given his debate performance, Trump should step aside in favor of another nominee -- although, in contrast with Biden, very few of Trump's own supporters say so.\n\nIt's clearly Biden who suffered more reputational harm from the debate. Half of Americans say it left them with a less favorable opinion of him, versus 22% who say that about Trump's performance. Twenty-seven percent see Trump more favorably because of the debate, versus just 7% for Biden on this measure.\n\nEven among people who say they'll vote for Biden in November, 81% say he is too old for another term and just 44% say he should continue in the race; 54% say he should step aside. Among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, more -- 62% -- say he should go. (For comparison, just 16% of Republicans and GOP leaners say Trump should withdraw.)\n\n% Saying Biden Should Step Aside ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll\n\nShould Biden withdraw -- and he maintains he won't -- just 44% of Americans overall say they'd be satisfied with Harris as the Democratic nominee, with 53% dissatisfied. Among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, however, satisfaction with Harris reaches 70%, and it's 76% among current Biden supporters.\n\nTaken another way, in an open-ended question, Democrats and Democratic leaners were asked whom they'd like to see take Biden's place if he withdrew. Twenty-nine percent named Harris, easily the leading choice in this group, with all others in the single digits. Still, demonstrating fragmentation, more than 30 potential candidates were named.\n\nThe debate\n\nThe verdict on the debate is not close: Two-thirds of Americans say Trump won it, rising to 74% of those who watched it. (This includes those who initially call it a tie but then lean toward one or the other as the winner.)\n\nAmong Biden supporters, 59% say he won, demonstrating a significant degree of loyalty in this group. Among those who favor either Trump or another candidate, by contrast, a nearly unanimous 94% say Trump won the debate.\n\nAnother result may raise the stakes for Biden's future appearances, including his scheduled news conference later Thursday: Among viewers, 61% say their opinion of Biden worsened as a result of the debate. Among those who didn't watch, many fewer say so -- 34%.\n\nStay or go\n\nMajorities across most groups say Biden should step aside, albeit to varying degrees. It's lowest, 49%, among Black people, including 32% among Black people age 50 and older, an especially strong group for Biden.\n\nFifty-six percent of Democrats say Biden should withdraw, rising to 72% of independents and a nearly identical share of Republicans, 73%. Six in 10 liberals say so, as do about 7 in 10 moderates and conservatives. It's also about 7 in 10 among both white and Hispanic people. Even among people who have a favorable opinion of Biden personally, 55% say he should step aside, as do 77% of those who see him unfavorably.\n\nVote choice\n\nLike the Biden-Trump horse race overall, preferences among groups are very similar to what they were in April. It\u2019s 39-53%, Biden-Trump, among white people, for example, 49-42% among Hispanic people and 77-17% among Black people.\n\nHis debate performance notwithstanding, Democrats stick with Biden, 91-5%; Republicans with Trump, 94-4%; and independents, often swing voters in national elections, split 40-44% (Biden-Trump), not a significant difference.\n\nThere are some differences in Harris\u2019 support against Trump compared with Biden\u2019s, though not enough to make that race anything but another dead heat. Harris does better against Trump with women, 52-44%, compared with 47-46% for Biden-Trump among women.\n\nFurther, Harris has a significant lead over Trump among Hispanic people, 56-40%, while Biden does not. And Harris does 8 points better than Biden with urban women, 61% versus 53%. Harris\u2019s 82% support among Black people, and 86% among Black women, are not significantly different from Biden\u2019s results in these groups.\n\nAnother test, including Biden, Trump and third-party or independent candidates, again finds no meaningful change from April, with 41% for Biden, 42% for Trump, 10% for Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and 2% apiece for Cornel West and Jill Stein.\n\nAttributes\n\nAs noted, even after the debate Biden carries a comparative advantage in one key measure of goodwill. He's 8 points underwater on personal favorability, seen favorably by 42% of the public, unfavorably by 50%. Trump, by contrast, is 25 points underwater on this score, 34%-59%.\n\nThese favorability ratings are essentially unchanged since April, with no debate impact apparent. That's even while, among people who see Biden favorably overall, nearly 4 in 10 (37%) also say they see him less favorably than previously because of the debate.\n\nPersonal Favorability ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll\n\nA question ahead is what candidate attributes matter most to the public. That includes, for example, how much juice Biden gets from his clear advantage on honesty and trustworthiness, or his smaller, single-digit leads as the candidate who \"represents your personal values\" and \"will protect American democracy.\" He and Trump run essentially evenly in another, historically important attribute, understanding \"the problems of people like you.\"\n\nThat said, the hit to Biden on his perceived mental acuity and physical health are real. In April he trailed Trump on mental sharpness by 19 points; today, as mentioned, it's 30 points. And Biden's 22-point deficit on physical health in the spring is 31 points now.\n\nPersonal Attributes ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll\n\nTrump, moreover, betters Biden in terms of job approval. With 36% approving versus 57% disapproving, Biden is 21 points underwater on this score. Thinking back to Trump's presidency, 43% approve of his job performance, 52% disapprove, a narrower 9-point gap. Biden's job rating has been essentially steady for more than a year, and negative for three years.\n\nPlan B\n\nAs to possible successors, 67% of Black people -- an overwhelmingly Democratic group -- would be satisfied with Harris, the first Black person and first woman to serve as vice president, taking over from Biden. Fewer Hispanic people (51%) or white people (38%) would be satisfied, at least in part reflecting their differing partisan preferences.\n\nSatisfaction with a Harris nomination is about the same among Black women (70%) and Black men (64%; the 6-point difference isn't significant given sample sizes). Similarly, there's no difference between men and women overall in their views on Harris as the nominee.\n\nIn the open-ended question among Democrats and Democratic leaners, Harris leads in preference to replace Biden across groups -- named, for example, by 27% to 34% of men, women, Black people, Hispanic people and white people alike.\n\nAs many skipped or declined the question as picked Harris. Distantly following her, 7% named California Gov. Gavin Newsom as a preferred stand-in; 4%, former first lady Michelle Obama; 3% each, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; 2%, independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.; and 1%, eight other political figures from Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear to Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Others showed up with less than half a percent.\n\nMethodology\n\nThis ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll was conducted online via the probability-based Ipsos KnowledgePanel\u00ae July 5-9, 2024, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 2,431 adults. Partisan divisions are 32%-29%-27%, Democrats-Republicans-independents. Results have a margin of sampling error of 2 percentage points, including the design effect, for the full sample. Sampling error is not the only source of differences in polls.\n\nThe survey was produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates, with sampling and data collection by Ipsos.

Although voters across the country and territories cast ballots for their preferred candidate during their respective primaries or other contests, it\u2019s actually at the national convention where the party nominee is confirmed and formally announced.\n\nEvery four years, each Presidential Election Year, the major political parties hold a national convention to select their nominees for President and Vice President for that year\u2019s November General Election. Each convention is held in a location decided by the respective party\u2019s national convention committee which is responsible for planning their nominating convention.\n\nDelegates are selected in primary or caucus contests and are chosen because of their political leadership or activism. These delegates from each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia and several U.S. Territories then go to the national convention and confirm their choice of nominees for the Office of the U.S. President and Vice President . If a candidate does not secure the majority of a party\u2019s delegates the convention delegates choose the nominee through additional rounds of voting.\n\nAt the convention, the presidential nominee will officially announce their running mate or who will run with them as vice president.",

        "text": "Election-xiety? 2024 presidential race is seriously stressing Americans out\nAlthough Election Day is still nearly four months away, Tiffany Kreck finds herself getting increasingly anxious.\n\n\"I'm really trying to do a better job of controlling it,\" said Kreck, 35, a professional gardener and married mother of two.\n\nThe registered Republican from Ellsworth Maine doesn't intend to vote for either major party candidate but between this weekend's violence, the \"vitriolic\" language of the campaigns and the stakes for issues like the economy, reproductive rights and immigration \u2012 she can feel her blood pressure rise every time she thinks about the election.\n\nIn an election-related survey this spring, more than 40% of Americans reported signs of anxiety or depression. A similar percentage say the news and social media coverage of the election have them feeling even more anxious than usual, according to the GeneSight Mental Health Monitor poll conducted May 8-15 by Myriad Genetics,\n\nThose results coincide with another spring poll from the American Psychiatric Association that found most Americans are \"particularly anxious\" about the contentious election. And, in a Yahoo News/YouGov poll of 1,800 Americans conducted May 10 to 13, about 60% said they felt \"very\" or \"somewhat\" anxious about the presidential contest.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nIt's very likely many other Americans are anxious, maybe even depressed, over the election without even knowing it, experts say.\n\n\"The negative impacts are too big. They are about twice as large of a percentage as we'd like them to be,\" said Thomas Valente, a psychiatrist based in Leesburg, Florida, who analyzed GeneSight's poll before the results went public. \"And these polls were taken before the first presidential debate. I can only imagine what the numbers might be now.\"\n\nAftereffects of Trump's assassination attempt\n\nIf Americans weren't already anxious enough, many are likely feeling it even more after the attempted assassination of former president and presidential candidate Donald Trump on Saturday.\n\n\"It's natural to feel a heightened sense of anxiety, even dread, even asking ourselves, 'When does it end?' because something so drastic occurred before our eyes,\" said Arianna Galligher, associate director of the Stress, Trauma and Resilience (STAR) Program at Ohio State University.\n\nKreck described the assassination attempt as \"surreal\" but also \"par for the course.\"\n\nAt this point, she said she's buying an extra bag of rice to put away each trip to the grocery, because rice will be fine without refrigeration and a little goes a long way \u2012 in case things get really crazy.\n\nThe only thing that feels certain to her now is that we are in for a rocky ride. \"The scary part of it is that this is apparently reality,\" she said.\n\nDr. Rebecca Brendel, a psychiatrist and past president of the American Psychiatric Association said whether Americans support Trump or not, the shooting was \"shocking and antithetical to our political system no matter how divisive our language has become.\"\n\nThe stress of an event like this could cause some Americans to undergo changes in their eating and sleeping patterns, bouts of panic, sweaty palms, and shortness of breath because they can't think about anything else, Brendel said.\n\n\"We should give ourselves a mental and physical break,\" she said. \"Put the phone down, turn the TV off. Get outside, go for a walk, do (get) some exercise. We need to try reassuring ourselves that the world other than this event is still the same place.\"\n\nGalligher said people could still expect to see a range of responses and emotions, even days after such a major news event.\n\n\"Some will struggle with showing the best version of themselves. Crisis doesn\u2019t always lend to the best ways of coping,\" Galligher said. \"Some will lash out, some will have a hard time maintaining focus, and some may have some nervous energy they need to find outlets for release.\"\n\nGalligher said those episodes could happen especially during normal conversations with family and friends.\n\n\"We can also set some boundaries if the discussions become too contentious,\" Galligher said. \"It's OK to say 'Hey, let's take a break and talk about or do something we may have more in common.'\"\n\nOverall, Galligher said checking our emotions during this election season will be a constant challenge as Americans face \"a true test\" in this country\u2019s history.\n\n\"We have to fight to maintain our identity as Americans, as a nation prioritizing democracy,\" Galligher said. \"And in democracy, there is going to be some disagreement, but how we conduct ourselves during that discourse is really what matters.\"\n\n'Can't control the outcome'\n\nBefore the shooting, Trump, the Republican nominee, had moved slightly ahead of President Joe Biden in many polls, following the candidates' acrimonious debate on June 27. Two months ago, the candidates were in a dead heat, according to an exclusive USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll.\n\nThe fallout and issues including Trump's felony charges, escalating concerns over Biden's competency, and a presumed battle for preserving democracy, are among numerous contributing stressors for voters, said Colleen Marshall, a San Francisco-based chief clinical officer at Two Chairs, a mental health organization offering virtual and in-person therapy sessions.\n\nMarshall cited this spring's American Psychiatric Association/Morning Consult's mental health poll, which revealed that 73% of more than 2,200 Americans were particularly anxious about the election. Only the economy at 77% rated higher, with the election heightening a range of emotions and generating more conversations, Marshall added.\n\n\"Elections can be triggering because even though you are voting for the candidate you support, you can\u2019t control the outcome,\" Marshall said. \"And when you can\u2019t have that type of control, that\u2019s where our minds can go anywhere.\"\n\n\"Election anxiety,\" as Marshall dubbed it, ranked higher than personal safety, health concerns, and paying bills, according to the poll.\n\n\"I believe election cycles tend to be provocative, but we have this incredible, unprecedented divisiveness that's taking its toll on many of us,\" Marshall said. \"And while some of us can compartmentalize better than others, some can\u2019t put the brakes on that fear and worry.\"\n\nOverall, 43% of Americans in that poll said they were generally anxious, compared with 37% in 2023 and 32% in 2022.\n\nThe election is bringing a lot of unease about where the country is headed, Brendel said.\n\n\"Especially when we\u2019re in a setting when the political rhetoric is extremely divisive, and the rhetoric is saying your vote matters,\u201d Brendel said. \u201cAnd so, it\u2019s not surprising that people are very focused on it and concerned and really feeling a time of uncertainty as these decisions are perhaps more important than ever.\u201d\n\nFirst-time voter scared by election\n\nKara Coulter, 18, has everything going for her. But just weeks from the start of her first semester at UCLA, her top college choice, the first-time voter and Los Angeles native is already worried about the outcome of this fall's election.\n\n\"Oh my God, it scares me so much. I wonder what will my adulthood look like: What will it look like if Trump wins? What will it be if Biden wins?\" Coulter said. \" A lot is going on in my head. Everything is so unpredictable right now. We don\u2019t know what this country is going to look like even a year from now?\"\n\nShe's worried that if Trump wins, the country could be in for some harsh changes, spurred by conservative think tank Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, which has been described as \"authoritarian\" and calls for rolling back health care reform deporting undocumented immigrants, ending the Department of Education and making medication abortion unavailable.\n\nBut, Coulter, who plans to study sociology and entrepreneurship, said her \"voter fright\" won't stop her from the polls. And she plans to tell anybody who will listen, especially her fellow Generation Zers how important this election is.\n\n\"It\u2019s better to be educated walking into something new than essentially removing yourself from the process because you\u2019re scared,\" Coulter said. \"I'm going to exercise my right to vote because I know what all it took for us to do so. It's my hope and prayer that we turn out to vote.\"\n\nSome Americans are 'freaking out'\n\nDale Stenbroten, 62, of Saukville, Wisconsin, who didn't participate in any of the polls but identifies with their findings, believes there's widespread frustration nationwide. Stenbroten said his anxiety comes from the \"uncertain direction\" the nation has been taking.\n\n\"I think the majority of this country is freaking out,\" said Stenbroten who owns a farm resort that caters to large events like weddings. \"You want to think of it as just like a joke, but it's a sad, sick joke because people in this country are hurting and they are mad and sad.\"\n\nStenbroten said while he's lucky enough to have his own business and not be too bad shape, \"others aren't as fortunate and their situations affect all of us.\"\n\nStenbroten, who describes himself as a reformed news junkie and \"a moderate who tends to vote conservative,\" said while he backed Trump in 2020, he is now planning to vote for independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Kennedy had support from 8% of voters, in the latest USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll, which was conducted between June 28 and 30.\n\nStenbroten thought Trump did well with the economy as president, but now has some very \"serious issues\" ranging from his legal problems to his divisive nature.\n\nStenbroten also doesn't care for Biden. He said the president \"doesn't have the mental capacity\" to remain in office and he dislikes the administration's involvement with Russia's war in Ukraine and the conflict in Gaza.\n\n\"We need somebody in the White House with a brain and the intelligence to help heal this divide,\" Stenbroten said. \"This country doesn't need any more wars.\"\n\nKreck, also a Kennedy supporter, shares a similar view.\n\n\"There's so many of us in the middle who work, pay taxes, have families, and try to buy groceries just to make ends meet,\" Kreck said. \"And we feel like we\u2019re watching this horror show play out on this political stage.\"\n\nCoping with 'election anxiety'\n\nIn addition to possibly seeking professional help, Marshall said those Americans having election anxiety should try to create some boundaries, including not always watching and consuming politics or not talking as much to family and friends about it.\n\nFor those who want to be more politically engaged, Marshall said they can get involved by supporting candidates of their choice, by volunteering or by participating in get-out-the-vote drives.\n\nKreck said she feels for Americans who have \"checked out\" because of election anxiety, \"which in itself is a dangerous place for America to be if they somehow don\u2019t believe in the Democratic process.\"\n\nFor herself, Kreck said she is doing her best to escape the \"digital bombardment\" of the election and the worries that come with it.\n\nShe's made an effort to put down her phone, turn off the TV and spend more time outdoors with her children and lobsterman husband.\n\nShe's also trying to take more deep breaths.\n\n\"It sounds more simple than it really is,\" Kreck said, because politics are \"everywhere.\"",

        "text": "Biden vs. Trump election turnout: Will the far left vote to stop fascism? It better.\nThere\u2019s a surplus of despair in the American far left these days.\n\nBetween Joe Biden\u2019s ongoing support for the mass slaughter in Gaza, the Supreme Court\u2019s abysmally craven decision to grant Donald Trump near-total legal immunity, and the chaotic fallout from the first presidential debate, those who once might have voted for Bernie Sanders are finding quite little to feel hopeful about. As a result, more than a few people on the left are thinking about not voting altogether. I see the grim, burn-it-all-down sentiments stream past my eyes on my social feeds all day, every day.\n\nFirst of all: I get it.\n\nLet\u2019s say Biden remains the Democratic candidate. If a leftist thinks of a vote as a moral endorsement of a politician, then the case for them abstaining is straightforward. They don\u2019t want to empower Biden, who has been tepid (at best) on core left priorities like restraining state violence, defending abortion, enshrining trans rights, and\u2014perhaps most importantly\u2014stopping the carnage in Palestine. This was all the case before he showed himself to be perhaps dangerously infirm.\n\nLeftists who don\u2019t like Biden don\u2019t want to see him in office again, so they don\u2019t want to vote for him, or they want to withhold their vote until he changes course. Seems simple enough.\n\nBut that\u2019s not how politics works.\n\nThe point of electoral politics, as it is lived, is not to vote for a friend; it\u2019s to vote for your preferred enemy. You will never find a morally pure candidate, or one whose positions perfectly align with your own preferences. So you must find one whom you can effectively bully.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s often said that desiring to be president is a psychosis that should disqualify anyone who actually wants the job. I happen to agree. Never, in the history of this country, has there been a president who hasn\u2019t engaged in what the left would regard as unforgivable crimes. This is the nature of presidents, and politicians in general. If you, like me, are on the far left, you should never fully trust or have faith in any elected official.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut when I look at the Biden administration, I see a group of people who can be bullied in a leftist direction on some policy priorities. They have, at times, responded to pressure from their left wing in Congress (the so-called Squad and others), as well as pressure from unions and advocacy campaigns. They\u2019ve already made huge strides on climate, they\u2019ve brought forward anti-monopoly cases, and they pulled out of Afghanistan, among other actions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s far less than what is needed, to be sure\u2014but it\u2019s far more than what we\u2019re going to get if the left withholds its vote in significant numbers.\n\nWhenever I get into arguments about voting with my more hardcore friends, the conversation always turns sour when we get to this question: What happens when Biden loses in November?\n\nThe answer, of course, is that Trump becomes president again. And Project 2025 flies into effect. And the country goes mask-off fascist. And trans people like me become illegal by our very existence. And Israel \u201cfinishes the job\u201d in Gaza with vocal cheering from the White House. And Trump has his enemies imprisoned or worse with impunity. And the world teeters on the brink. And so on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUsually, when I get to this portion of my rant with these friends, they say they think all that stuff will happen whether or not they vote. There\u2019s a tendency to say Biden is just as bad as Trump, or that Trump will be able to take power even if Biden gets more votes. They\u2019ve completely lost faith in the system.\n\nOnce again: Yes, this system is broken! It\u2019s always been broken! But are you really going to argue that elections don\u2019t have consequences?\n\nWhen I was 14 years old, I was a huge fan of Ralph Nader. As a teenage anti-sweatshop activist, I believed that he was the only candidate in the 2000 presidential election who was speaking the truth and advocating for my policy goals. I went to a Nader rally in my hometown of Chicago, where the great journalist Studs Terkel spoke. I\u2019ll never forget what he said in his nasal bark: \u201cGore or Bush, what\u2019s your choice? Influenza or pneumonia, what\u2019s your choice?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt all sounds like nonsense to me now. Can anyone today truly argue that the world wasn\u2019t drastically changed by Gore\u2019s loss in 2000? Even if you don\u2019t accept the argument that Nader\u2019s candidacy is what lost Gore the election, how can you argue that the world wouldn\u2019t have been at least a little better if all of those Nader votes had gone to Gore and put the Dems over the top?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to understand what the don\u2019t-vote leftists think they will accomplish as a result of Biden losing. Do they hope that the worsening conditions will bring about the Revolution? Be serious. Where is the radical left that could make such a thing happen? Where is the leftist infrastructure, unity, or discipline that would be necessary for a triumph at the national level from American communists, anarchists, or even socialists?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Weimar Germany, where the German Communist Party was far more robust and ready to fight in the streets, the revolution-oriented strategy\u2014allowing a fascist victory to raise urgency and bring about a more lasting leftist one\u2014didn\u2019t work. Infamously, in the fateful early years of the 1930s, the German Communists viciously opposed the governing center-left Social Democratic Party. Calling the centrists \u201cSocial Fascists,\u201d they declared that there was no substantive difference between liberalism and Nazism. They refused to ally themselves with the center.\n\nAlthough the Communists did not originate the much-quoted phrase \u201cNach Hitler, kommen wir\u201d (\u201cAfter Hitler, we\u2019re coming\u201d), it was very much their policy. The belief was that Hitler might come to power, but that Nazi misrule would only rally support to the Communists, leading to a glorious revolution.\n\nWell, it didn\u2019t go that way, did it?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead of echoing the hardline leftists of 1931, the American left should look to their counterparts in France of 2024. The world has breathed a sigh of relief over the shocking upset against Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right party in the recent legislative elections there. The key to that victory was a last-minute alliance of the centrist liberals and the radical left. It worked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith any luck, the French left will follow through by using their legislative plurality to bully their centrist president into being better. It won\u2019t be a revolution, but I\u2019ll certainly take it over Vichy 2.0. Let us follow their example.\n\nThere\u2019s still time to avoid the omnicatastrophe that would be a fascist takeover of the nuclear-armed United States. We don\u2019t have to play the organizing game on the highest difficulty level, which is what the left is looking at in the event of a Trump victory. The man all but wants to formally establish a Christian dictatorship, dismantle the very idea of federal regulations, outlaw contraception, and round up and deport millions of immigrants. And that\u2019s just a taste of the hellish chaos that looms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ballot box might not be enough, but we cannot abandon it out of depressive nihilism. We must build an alternative political structure and put pressure on politicians every day, not just once every four years. But we won\u2019t have the opportunity to do that if Trump is president and makes such organizing illegal.\n\nLeon Trotsky himself urged the German Communists to reconsider their foolish pride in 1931. \u201cShould fascism come to power, it will ride over your skulls and spines like a terrific tank,\u201d he declared, accurately. \u201cYour salvation lies in merciless struggle. And only a fighting unity with the Social Democratic workers can bring victory. Make haste, worker-Communists, you have very little time left!\u201d\n\nOnce again, the hour grows late. This November, leftist apathy can only bring disaster. Workers of the world, unite with your liberal foes; if you do not, you have everything to lose.",

        "text": "How Project 2025 could radically reshape higher ed\nBreaking up the Education Department is one of several policy ideas in a sweeping conservative plan for a potential second Trump administration.\n\nA conservative blueprint for a second Trump administration calls for fundamentally reshaping the government and federal higher education policy.\n\nSpearheaded by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, Project 2025 offers a vision of a radically overhauled and pared-down federal government that\u2019s largely staffed by party loyalists, free of \u201cwoke culture warriors\u201d and more responsive to the priorities of the president. While the nearly 900-page policy manual has been in the works for more than two years, its policy recommendations have garnered greater attention and scrutiny in recent months as the presidential election heats up. Critics say the plan represents an attempt to weaken constitutional checks and balances and take away personal freedoms.\n\n\u201cThis is an attempt to basically rearrange who has power and who doesn\u2019t,\u201d said Michael Podhorzer, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank that\u2019s worked in recent months to raise public awareness of the blueprint and its potential implications. \u201cIt\u2019s authoritarian, because this agenda cannot be implemented by anything remotely like a democratic process.\u201d\n\nMost Popular Stories Most Popular\n\nPresident Biden and other Democrats have increasingly sounded the alarm about Project 2025 ahead of the presidential election and sought to tie its proposals\u2014particularly those restricting access to abortion and firing civil servants\u2014to former president Trump. In response, Trump has recently tried to distance himself from the effort, saying, \u201cI wish them luck, but I have nothing to do with them.\u201d But more than 30 former Trump aides and officials are involved with the project, including the two people spearheading it, according to an analysis from the investigative site Popular Information.\n\nThe manual, titled \u201cMandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise,\u201d outlines a wide range of policy goals for every federal agency along with details about the new legislation, regulations and executive orders that would be needed to make those goals a reality. Beyond the blueprint, the multipronged Project 2025 includes recruiting and training potential staff for a new administration and assembling a playbook for its first 180 days. Dozens of conservative organizations are part of the broader effort.\n\nThe 44-page Education Department chapter was authored by Lindsey Burke, director of Heritage\u2019s Center for Education Policy, and credits several former Trump officials as contributors. Its proposals are bold and sweeping: It calls for dismantling the agency and putting an end to loan forgiveness. It details plans to overhaul the accreditation system and roll back new Title IX protections for LGBTQ+ students and sexual assault survivors while ending all ongoing investigations into reported Title IX violations.\n\nFederal higher education policy should be more than \u201cinefficient and open-ended subsidies\u201d to colleges and universities, Project 2025 argues. Instead, it should focus on bolstering the workforce skills of those who don\u2019t want to pursue a four-year degree.\n\nProject 2025 reflects Republicans\u2019 push against diversity, equity and inclusion policies across the federal government, calling for stripping DEI requirements and references to sexual orientation and gender identity, among other terms, from \u201cevery federal rule, agency regulation, contract, grant, regulation, and piece of legislation that exists.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis book, this agenda, the entire Project 2025 is a plan to unite the conservative movement and the American people against elite rule and woke culture warriors,\u201d Heritage president Kevin Roberts writes in the foreward to the manual. \u201cWith enemies at home and abroad, there is no margin for error. Time is running short. If we fail, the fight for the very idea of America may be lost.\u201d\n\nHow would Project 2025 reshape higher education in America? Here\u2019s your guide to the central components of the plan, how they would work\u2014and just how feasible it all might be.\n\nUndoing the Education Department\n\nProject 2025 calls for a lightly regulated higher education system run with limited involvement from the federal government. Ultimately, it declares that the federal government\u2019s only role in education policy should be \u201cthat of a statistics-gathering agency that disseminates information to the states.\u201d\n\nThe most significant piece of the plan for higher ed is its call to break up the Education Department and disperse the management of federal education programs\u2014those that would still exist, that is\u2014across multiple agencies. For example, the Office for Civil Rights would move to the Department of Justice, while the Bureau of Indian Affairs would oversee tribal colleges and universities. The Treasury Department would handle the federal student loan portfolio.\n\nHeritage and many Republicans have long called for shutting down the Education Department, though Project 2025 offers a more detailed plan for how they would do so.\n\nThe rationale for such a shake-up is clear, Burke writes. \u201cBolstered by an ever-growing cabal of special interests that thrive off federal largesse, the infrastructure that supports America\u2019s costly federal intervention in education from early childhood through graduate school has entrenched itself. But, unlike the public sector bureaucracies, public employee unions, and the higher education lobby, families and students do not need a Department of Education to learn, grow, and improve their lives.\u201d\n\nIf Congress fails to abolish the Education Department, Project 2025 calls for lawmakers to eliminate the process known as negotiated rule making, which the agency currently must use to issue new regulations like those for Title IX. The department would follow the same rule-making process as other federal agencies: posting regulations for public comment, reviewing those comments and then finalizing the rule.\n\n\u201cIn recent decades, negotiated rulemaking has become a veritable three-ring circus, replete with negotiators who use their Twitter accounts and other social media feeds during negotiations to denigrate the process and their peer negotiators in real time,\u201d Burke writes.\n\nWith or without an Education Department, Roberts writes in the foreward, the agenda of the next administration \u201cshould promote educational opportunities outside the woke-dominated system of public schools and universities, including trade schools, apprenticeship programs, and student-loan alternatives that fund students\u2019 dreams instead of Marxist academics.\u201d\n\nReining in the Accreditors\n\nThe accrediting agencies that monitor the quality of colleges and universities have become \u201cde facto government agents\u201d that impose \u201cideological preferences\u201d on institutions, according to Project 2025. Thus, they must be reined in.\n\n\u201cAccreditors, while professing support for academic freedom and campus free speech, have presided over a precipitous decline in both over the past decade,\u201d Burke writes. \u201cDespite maintaining criteria that demand such policies, accreditors have done nothing to dampen the illiberal chill that has swept across American campuses over the past decade.\u201d\n\nUnder the plan, Congress would pass legislation to prohibit accreditors from requiring institutions to set DEI policies and otherwise intrude \u201cupon the governance of state-supported educational institutions.\u201d States would be allowed to authorize accrediting agencies and serve as accreditors themselves. The Education Department\u2014should it still exist\u2014would encourage new accreditors to step up and \u201crefuse to recognize all accreditors that abuse their power.\u201d\n\nColleges and universities currently have to be accredited by an Education Department\u2013recognized agency in order to receive federal student aid, according to U.S. law, making accreditors gatekeepers to the money. Project 2025 suggests that Congress and the potential Trump administration consider severing the connection between accreditation and financial aid eligibility, returning the system to \u201cits role of voluntary quality assurance.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis would permit accreditors to put some \u2018teeth\u2019 back into their standards without creating high-stakes disasters, such as institutional loss of Title IV access through paperwork submission errors, a state exercising its constitutional authority to administer its public colleges and universities, or an institution freely exercising the religious beliefs of its founders,\u201d Burke writes.\n\nThe focus on accreditation comes as the system has become increasingly politicized and faced criticism from progressives who argue the agencies are too lax, letting low-quality programs off the hook, and from Republicans who bristle at the restrictions altogether. Last year, Trump declared that his secret weapon to reclaim colleges and universities from the \u201cradical Left\u201d was the college accreditation system and vowed to \u201cfire\u201d the accreditors.\n\nQuashing Loan Forgiveness\n\nPresident Biden has so far forgiven $167 billion in federal student loans for nearly five million Americans. That \u201cmust never happen again,\u201d Project 2025 declares.\n\n\u201cThe Biden Administration has mercilessly pillaged the student loan portfolio for crass political purposes without regard to the needs of current taxpayers or future students,\u201d Burke writes.\n\nTo ensure a future department doesn\u2019t forgive loans like Biden has, Project 2025 calls for rescinding regulations that made it easier for those who were defrauded by their college\u2014or who attended an institution that closed\u2014to discharge their loans. Similarly, it would nix the new income-driven repayment program, known as Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE.\n\nThe chapter also recommends ending the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which allows teachers and others who work in public service jobs to have their loan balances wiped out after 10 years of making payments.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to privatize all federal lending programs. If that proves impossible, the Education Department should phase out income-driven repayment programs, put colleges on the hook for unpaid student loans and eliminate PLUS loans for graduate students and parents of undergrads. The plan doesn\u2019t call for changes to the Pell Grant program for low-income students.\n\nThe dramatic changes wouldn\u2019t stop there: Project 2025 also called for the elimination of the Office of Federal Student Aid. The agency, housed within the Education Department, currently oversees student loan programs. The plan says Congress should create a new government corporation \u201cwith professional governance and management\u201d to replace the FSA.\n\nSo, Can They Really Do All This?\n\nIn short, yes, especially if Republicans win majorities in both houses of Congress along with the presidency in November.\n\nProject 2025 is the latest in a series of policy manuals from the Heritage Foundation that date back to 1981, when President Ronald Reagan took office. The success of the first edition inspired the rest, Roberts writes in his foreward.\n\n\u201cBy the end of that year, more than 60 percent of its recommendations had become policy\u2014and Reagan was on his way to ending stagflation, reviving American confidence and prosperity, and winning the Cold War,\u201d he says.\n\nThe 2016 edition, published shortly before Trump was elected, also proved effective. Heritage said in 2018 that two-thirds of its recommendations had been either enacted or embraced by the Trump administration.\n\nDismantling the Education Department and some of the other reforms would require action from Congress. But other recommendations to rescind or rewrite regulations, or to stop enforcement of Title IX, all could happen through executive actions.\n\nWhat Are Critics Saying?\n\nProject 2025 shows that the 2024 election is a choice between democracy or autocracy, said Patrick Gaspard, president and CEO of the Center for American Progress, at a July 9 symposium in Washington, D.C., designed to raise awareness of the perils that Democrats and liberals believe the plan poses.\n\nRecent polling from CAP found that roughly one in 10 Americans were aware of the blueprint, though recent polling from Navigator, a progressive polling firm, found that awareness has ticked up. Now, only about seven in 10 Americans say they\u2019ve heard too little about Project 2025 to have an opinion.\n\nGaspard said the lack of awareness was disconcerting given the potential consequences of the policies. A recent analysis from CAP found that the student loan policies in Project 2025 would drive up student loan payments for millions of borrowers. More broadly, Project 2025 would \u201cpulverize the United States government,\u201d Gaspard said.\n\nGaspard and others at the symposium called out Roberts, the Heritage president, for his recent comments that the country \u201cis in the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be.\u201d\n\nMaya Wiley, the president and CEO of the Leadership Conference for Civil and Human Rights, had a slightly different prediction: Project 2025 calls the country to a second civil war, she says, and constitutes a \u201cblueprint for ending\u201d democracy.\n\nRepresentative Jamie Raskin, the Maryland Democrat who served on the committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection, described Project 2025 as a continuation of efforts to overturn the 2020 election. It applies lessons reformers on the right gleaned from the first Trump administration, he said.\n\n\u201cWhat they learned from the last Trump administration is they did not sufficiently pack the government with people who are willing to engage in postconstitutional actions,\u201d said Raskin. \u201cIt\u2019s all about power, and they\u2019re going to use their power in order to entrench themselves. What we\u2019re talking about here is protection of the democratic form of life.\u201d",

        "text": "Can the 25th amendment be used to replace Biden?\nFollowing his stumbling performance at the first debate against former president Donald Trump, President Joe Biden has sought to reassure the Democratic Party about his electability, as well as his age and capacity to govern.\n\nYet public calls from some Democratic officials and donors to replace him on the ballot have raised questions of what procedural options there are for doing so.\n\nOne of these is the 25th Amendment, which governs presidential succession.\n\nAlthough it deals with a critical issue, the 25th amendment dates only to 1967.\n\nBefore then, the only relevant statute was Article II of the Constitution, stating that the vice president would assume presidential duties in the event of the president's death, resignation or inability to discharge his duties.\n\nBut this article had major limitations: It said nothing about replacing the vice president, nor did it specify how a president's inability to govern would be determined.\n\nThe lack of clarity has caused problems throughout U.S. history \u2014 James Garfield and Woodrow Wilson both spent portions of their presidencies largely incapacitated, with no mandate for the vice president to assume office while the president still lived.\n\nAfter President John F. Kennedy's assassination in 1963, there was a greater urgency to clarify the rules.\n\nAmendment outlines process\n\nProposed in 1965 by Senator Birch Bayh and ratified two years later, the 25th Amendment contains four sections.\n\nSection 1 reiterates Article II but goes further to clarify that in the event of a presidential vacancy, the vice president becomes the new president and fully succeeds to the office rather than only assuming its duties as acting president. This had previously not been specified and initially caused confusion when John Tyler succeeded William Henry Harrison.\n\nSection 2 filled a critical gap by laying out a procedure for installing a new vice president: nomination by the president and confirmation by both houses of Congress.\n\nThis section's importance was proven shortly afterward in 1973, when Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned over corruption charges. Left without a vice president and facing his own investigation over the Watergate scandal, President Richard Nixon would have been succeeded by House Speaker Carl Albert as per the Presidential Succession Act of 1947.\n\nInstead, Nixon invoked the 25th Amendment for the first time to nominate Gerald Ford as vice president. Less than a year later, Ford became president upon Nixon's resignation.\n\nSection 3 allowed a president to declare an inability to govern by formally notifying congressional leaders, thereby temporarily transferring his powers and duties, and allowing the vice president to become acting president.\n\nA president may also reverse this action by notifying Congress of a fitness to resume office.\n\nPreviously, a similar arrangement had been informally adopted between President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Vice President Richard Nixon, with Nixon filling in multiple times when Eisenhower was hospitalized.\n\nSince then, the section has been invoked by Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush and Joe Biden when undergoing surgeries.\n\nCongress gets final say\n\nSection 4 is the most complex part of the amendment, addressing who else besides the president may declare the president unable to perform official duties.\n\nThe text grants this power to the vice president, along with a majority of presidential Cabinet members, though it also allows Congress to designate other officers instead.\n\nCongress also has the final say if the president disputes the declaration and maintains a fitness for office, requiring a two-thirds vote to determine that the president is truly incapable of governing.\n\nThis section is similar to the impeachment process in allowing a sitting president to be relieved of power by other government officials.\n\nBut unlike impeachment, Section 4 only allows a president to be suspended rather than removed from office, with the vice president becoming acting president until the next election.\n\nAnd while impeachment applies to wrongful conduct or abuse of presidential powers, the 25th Amendment concerns the ability to exercise these powers.\n\nDefinition of inability left open\n\nThe scope of what constitutes inability, however, is intentionally left open. While the most obvious interpretation is a health emergency, constitutional experts have raised other possibilities such as kidnapping, temporary impairment or extreme incompetence.\n\nIn fact, there are few formal limits on what can be considered presidential inability as long as the vice president, a majority of Cabinet members and a supermajority of Congress can agree on it.\n\nAlthough Section 4 has never been used, the possibility has been raised, most recently in the aftermath of the attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters on January 6, 2021.\n\nDemocrats and some Republicans called on Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment, citing Trump's apparent unwillingness to intervene or use his presidential powers to stop the riot.\n\nWhile the amendment was never invoked, Democrats initiated impeachment proceedings in the last week of Trump's presidency.\n\nNow, it is Vice President Kamala Harris facing calls to invoke the 25th Amendment to relieve Biden of power, including a formal resolution filed by Republican Representative Chip Roy.\n\nBut many of the calls have come from supporters of the Democratic Party, who argue that doing so would assuage voter concerns about Biden's age and give Harris more legitimacy going into the election as acting president.\n\nHowever, the Constitution sets a deliberately high threshold for removing a democratically elected president.\n\nTo prevent partisan abuses, the drafters of the 25th Amendment made sure that the only people who can invoke it are the leaders of a president's own administration, who would be the least likely to oppose him.\n\nA vice president planning to submit the required declaration to Congress might need to operate secretly in convincing enough Cabinet members to sign on, as the president could preemptively dismiss any Cabinet members openly intending to remove the president from office.\n\nFor this reason, the drafters gave Congress the option of designating an alternative body, such as an independent medical panel or a standing bipartisan committee that would decide questions of presidential inability along with the vice president.\n\nBut to date, they have not done so. The invocation of the 25th Amendment remains an unlikely hypothetical, though its existence may still influence internal party discussions.",

        "text": "What Americans think about Project 2025\nMost Americans haven't heard much about Project 2025, an effort from the conservative Heritage Foundation to assemble \"a governing agenda and the right people\" ready for a potential Republican president taking office in January 2025, a new YouGov poll finds. But the presidential transition project, as Heritage calls it, is better-known \u2014 and much more disliked \u2014 among Democrats after recent attacks from high-profile figures including President Joe Biden. Most of a dozen Project 2025 proposals included in the poll are unpopular with Americans. Overall, 20% of U.S. adult citizens say they've heard a lot about Project 2025, while 39% have heard a little and 42% have heard nothing at all. 35% of Democrats say they've heard a lot about the project, compared to 7% of Republicans.\n\nNot only have few Americans heard much about Project 2025, but few have an opinion about it. 48% don't know whether they have a favorable or unfavorable opinion, while 13% have a very or somewhat favorable opinion, and 39% have an unfavorable opinion. That's driven by Democrats, among whom 8% have a favorable opinion and 64% have an unfavorable opinion. Most Independents with an opinion about Project 2025 dislike it (7% favorable, 38% unfavorable), while Republicans are more positive (26% favorable, 12% unfavorable).\n\nDemocrats (30%) are much more likely than Republicans (8%) to have seen a lot of news coverage in the past week about Project 2025. That's a bigger partisan gap than any of the nine other news stories YouGov asked Americans about. Majorities of Democrats and Republicans had seen a lot of coverage about whether Biden would withdraw from the presidential race.\n\nYouGov asked Americans about nine different proposals contained in the Project 2025 document, without mentioning in the question that the proposals are from the project. None have support from more than 50% of Americans, though two of the nine have more support than opposition: Sending U.S. troops to help make arrests along the U.S.-Mexico border, and returning the U.S. to a gold-backed currency. A third, outlawing pornography, has equal shares of support and opposition. The other six proposals have more opposition than support.\n\nAll nine proposals have more support from Republicans than Democrats. Seven have support from a majority of Republicans, while none have support from more than one-third of Democrats.",

They are calling on Biden to show a clear path to victory against his likely opponent, former President Donald Trump, in the upcoming election.\u201d\n\nHowever, Biden vowed that he will be \u201crunning this race to end \u201cof the November election, despite private calls from Democrats to drop out.

It\u2019s time to come together, move forward as a unified party, and defeat Donald Trump,\u201d said Biden\n\nFor breaking news and live news updates, like us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

        "text": "4. Interest in the 2024 election\nVoter engagement with the 2024 election is about as high today it was at similar points during the 2020 and 2016 campaigns.\n\nAnd on various measures of interest in the campaign and voting, there are no significant differences between Biden and Trump supporters.\n\nMost voters (71%) say it really matters who wins the election. This is slightly lower than the share who said this about the 2020 election that August (76%) and somewhat higher than the share who said this about the 2016 election that July (67%).\n\nBiden and Trump supporters are equally likely to see high stakes in the election. Nearly identical shares of Biden (79%) and Trump supporters (78%) say it really matters who wins the election.\n\nVoters who support Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are far less likely than Biden or Trump supporters to say the outcome really matters (39% say this). (Read more about election engagement among Biden, Trump and Kennedy supporters.\n\nThe shares of Biden and Trump supporters saying it really matters who wins are quite similar to views in August 2020. They are higher than the shares of Clinton and Trump supporters saying this in August 2016.\n\nDemographic differences in views of the stakes in the 2024 election\n\nAs was the case during the past two presidential contests, there are sizable demographic differences in the shares of voters who say it really matters who wins.\n\nAge\n\nVoters ages 18 to 29 are less likely than older voters to say it really matters who wins the election. Only about half (51%) say it really matters, which is roughly similar to the shares of young voters saying this four and eight years ago.\n\nThe share saying it really matters increases with age. More than eight-in-ten voters ages 65 and older (86%) say this, the highest among age groups.\n\nRace and ethnicity\n\nWhite voters continue to be more likely than voters in other racial and ethnic groups to say it really matters who wins.\n\nRoughly three-quarters of White voters (76%) say this compared with about six-in-ten Black (63%), Hispanic (58%) and Asian voters (58%).\n\nHow motivated are voters at this point in the campaign?\n\nA majority of registered voters (56%) say they are extremely motivated to vote in the presidential election. Another 16% say they are very motivated to vote while 12% say they are somewhat motivated.\n\nAbout one-in-seven (15%) say they are not too or not at all motivated to vote in the election.\n\nIdentical shares of Biden supporters and Trump supporters (63% each) say they are extremely motivated to vote this fall.\n\nBy comparison, just 21% of voters who support Robert F. Kennedy Jr. say they are extremely motivated.\n\nAmong demographic groups\n\nAs with other measures of election engagement, there are demographic differences in motivation to vote. And the patterns in the current election are consistent with past elections.\n\nOlder voters overall are more likely than young voters to say they are extremely motivated to vote in the presidential election.\n\nAbout a third of registered voters ages 18 to 29 (34%) say they are extremely motivated to vote. That rises to 49% among voters 30 to 49 and to 65% among those 50 and older.\n\nSimilar shares of Biden (42%) and Trump supporters (38%) ages 18 to 29 say they are extremely motivated to vote. The shares expressing this view increase with age among both candidates\u2019 supporters. Roughly three-quarters of Biden (75%) and Trump supporters (72%) ages 65 and older say they are extremely motivated.\n\nA 63% majority of White voters say they are extremely motivated to vote, compared with 41% of Black voters, 36% of Hispanic voters and 39% of Asian voters.\n\nThese racial and ethnic differences are seen among each candidates\u2019 supporters. For instance, while 71% of White Biden supporters say they are extremely motivated to vote, smaller shares of Black (50%) and Hispanic (49%) voters who back Biden say the same.\n\nHow voter attention compares to past elections\n\nVoter attention to and interest in the 2024 campaign is not markedly different from the past two elections.\n\nAttention to news about the 2024 election\n\nAbout a third of voters (33%) say they are following election news very closely. Another 41% are following election news fairly closely.\n\nThe share following election news very closely has increased 5 percentage points since April. Interest in election news tends to increase over the course of a campaign.\n\nThe share of voters following election news very closely is currently higher than at about the same point in 2020 (27% in June 2020) but lower than in 2016 (41% in July 2016).\n\nThought about the 2024 candidates\n\nNearly six-in-ten voters (58%) say they have given a lot of thought to the 2024 presidential candidates, up from 49% in April. In June 2020, about half of voters (52%) said they had given a lot of thought to the candidates.\n\nThere are no significant differences in the shares of Biden (64%) and Trump (62%) supporters who say they have thought a lot about the candidates.",

        "text": "Biden\u2019s election crisis: What happens if the US president loses support?\nMore Democrats are calling on Biden to drop out of the race, but the US president has remained defiant against critics.\n\nWashington, DC \u2013 Joe Biden says he is not going anywhere. On Thursday, the United States president was once again unequivocal in rejecting calls to drop out of the election race, stressing that he will be the Democratic nominee to beat Donald Trump in November.\n\nBut the 81-year-old president\u2019s assertiveness has done little to quiet concerns about his age after a disastrous debate performance last month where he appeared at times confused and unable to articulate policy positions.\n\nA Washington Post/ABC poll on Thursday found that 67 percent of respondents, including 56 percent of Democrats, want Biden to end his campaign.\n\nLater in the day, Congress members Hillary Scholten, Greg Stanton and Ed Case joined a growing list of Democratic officials calling on Biden to end his candidacy.\n\nI was one of President Biden's earliest supporters in 2020, and I'm proud of the progress we've made for Arizona. However the stakes in this election could not be higher. For our country's sake, it is time for the President to pass the torch to a new generation of leaders. pic.twitter.com/KSX1jd0O6m \u2014 Greg Stanton (@gregstantonaz) July 11, 2024\n\n\u201cPresident Biden has spent his life serving our nation and building the next generation of American leadership,\u201d Scholten, who represents a district in the key swing state of Michigan, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cFor the good of our democracy, I believe it is time for him to step aside from the presidential race and allow a new leader to step up.\u201d\n\nSeveral other lawmakers had also called on the incumbent to exit the race, including one senator \u2014 Vermont\u2019s Peter Welch \u2014 who said on Wednesday that Biden should withdraw for the \u201cgood of the country\u201d.\n\nOutside Washington, DC, Hollywood icon George Clooney \u2014 a prolific donor for Democratic candidates \u2014 penned a scathing op-ed for The New York Times this week, arguing that Biden\u2019s age could cost the party the elections.\n\n\u201cWe are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won\u2019t win the House, and we\u2019re going to lose the Senate,\u201d Clooney wrote. \u201cThis isn\u2019t only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and Congress member and governor who I\u2019ve spoken with in private.\u201d\n\nCompounding Biden\u2019s political crisis is a flood of news stories based on anonymous sources that have questioned the president\u2019s ability to lead the country.\n\nFor example, CNN reported on Thursday that Biden has not held a full cabinet meeting since October and that past meetings have been scripted and \u201corchestrated\u201d, becoming akin to an \u201cact\u201d.\n\nProgressives for Biden\n\nEmbattled but defiant, Biden has nevertheless found vocal supporters in an unlikely corner of Democratic politics: the left wing of the party.\n\nThat comes despite progressives\u2019 misgivings about the White House\u2019s unconditional support for Israel and its deadly war on Gaza.\n\nCongresswoman Ilhan Omar, for instance, backed the president on multiple occasions over the past weeks. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, another prominent left-wing lawmaker, appeared to dismiss calls for Biden to leave the race as well.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden is our nominee. He is not leaving this race. He is in this race, and I support him,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told reporters on Monday.\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders \u2014 who was Biden\u2019s closest challenger for the 2020 Democratic nomination \u2014 also expressed support for the president while calling for more progressive policies.\n\n\u201cBiden and Democrats can win this election if they address the needs of the working class,\u201d Sanders said in a statement. \u201cThe American people want change. It will either be the change of Trump\u2019s reactionary and xenophobic policies or change that benefits working families.\u201d\n\nIn defending their track record, Biden and his allies have pointed to policies that they say helped working Americans. The Democratic president has also gone on the offensive in several recent media appearances, deriding critics as elites trying to undermine the will of the voters.\n\nMoreover, the Democratic president used the final day of a NATO summit in Washington, DC, to showcase what his aides describe as his foreign policy prowess. At the podium, he touted his success in holding the alliance together during Russia\u2019s ongoing invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the United States of America. We are the indispensable nation. Our leadership matters. Our partnerships matter. This moment matters. We must rise to meet it,\u201d Biden said at the news conference, held on the sidelines of the summit on Thursday.\n\nWhat comes next?\n\nRegardless of the internal and external pressure Biden can be facing, no one can force him to withdraw from the race.\n\nBiden did not face a serious primary challenge, and he won nearly all the pledged delegates, meaning that he will cruise to the nomination during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next month.\n\nSo he alone can remove himself from contention.\n\nIf Biden withdraws, a new nominee would be chosen at the convention by thousands of Democratic Party officials, activists and organisers, known as delegates.\n\nTammy Greer, a professor in the department of public management and policy at Georgia State University, said calls for Biden to end his campaign without a clear alternative only help Trump \u2014 whom Democrats portray as a threat to democracy.\n\n\u201cWhat is your alternative? Number one,\u201d Greer told Al Jazeera, listing potential hurdles. \u201cNumber two, do you have time to have an alternative? And number three, if you don\u2019t have time for an alternative, the alternative is the former president [Trump]. So which one do you want?\u201d\n\nMatt Dallek, a political historian and professor at George Washington University, said that if Biden ends his campaign, his pledged delegates would be free to back other candidates and Democrats would head to a contested convention where the nominee is chosen at the event.\n\nDallek noted that US political parties picked their nominees at the convention through multiple ballots for most of their history. The modern primary election system was largely put in place in 1972.\n\n\u201cIt is impossible to predict whether it would be a disaster or advantageous to the Democratic Party,\u201d Dallek told Al Jazeera last week.\n\nHe said the party base could fracture and descend into chaos with multiple candidates vying for the nomination.\n\n\u201cThe other scenario is that Democrats have a robust competition \u2014 even if it\u2019s messy \u2014 and settle on a very exciting, younger, middle-of-the-road, sane governor,\u201d Dallek said.",

        "text": "Rightwing claim of \u20180% chance\u2019 of fair US election previews effort to undo 2024 result\nA major conservative thinktank previewed rightwing efforts to overturn the 2024 election on Thursday, with a top official saying there was a \u201c0% chance of a free and fair election\u201d.\n\nMike Howell, executive director of the Oversight Project at the Heritage Foundation, made the comments at an event in Washington sharing the results of a hypothetical exercise mapping out several implausible scenarios that could take place after the election. The outlandish scenarios involved Barbara Streisand being kidnapped by Hamas, antifa-BLM protesters taking over a detention facility and the FBI arresting Donald Trump after winning the election.\n\nThe effort was designed to muddy the waters over the threat to the 2024 election posed by Donald Trump, who has repeatedly refused to commit to accepting the election results and tried to overturn the 2020 vote. Instead, the Heritage Foundation, which is also behind the extreme Project 2025, wanted to suggest that it was Joe Biden who could try to overturn the result of the election, echoing the ex-president\u2019s repeated claims that it is actually Biden who is the threat to democracy.\n\n\u201cPresident Biden is very well-positioned to hold the White House by force in the case of an unfavorable electoral outcome,\u201d the report summarizing the exercise says. \u201cThe lawlessness of the Biden administration \u2013 at the border, in staffing considerations, and in routine defiance of court rulings \u2013 makes clear that the current president and his administration not only possesses the means, but perhaps also the intent, to circumvent constitutional limits and disregard the will of the voters should they demand a new president.\u201d\n\nKarine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, has said Biden will accept the election results. \u201cThere\u2019s no place for putting yourself above your entire country,\u201d she said earlier this year. \u201cThat is a commitment from the president.\u201d\n\nBut at the Heritage event, that reality was ignored.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m formally accusing the Biden administration of creating the conditions that most reasonable policymakers and officials cannot in good conscience certify an election,\u201d Howell said.\n\nHowell\u2019s comments are notable because Republican officials are increasingly putting pressure on the certification process in several states, an alarming development experts say could be a major part of an effort to overturn election results this fall. For example, Republican commissioners in Washoe county, the second most populous county in Nevada, recently refused to certify a primary without any evidence of wrongdoing. Republicans in Georgia are also seeking to give county election board members more discretion to slow down the certification of the election.\n\nThe report identifies four main \u201cthreats\u201d to the 2024 election. One is that the Department of Justice identifies enough civil and voting rights violations to interfere in the certification of election results. The second is that law enforcement officials will \u201carrest opponents of the regime\u201d (Trump has actually pledged to prosecute his enemies). The third is that there will be organized violence to intimidate state and local election officials (officials throughout the county have reported being harassed by those who believe Trump won). The fourth is that the media will suppress information.\n\nThe misleading document comes as the Heritage Foundation has come under scrutiny for Project 2025, a 900-plus page blueprint that lays out radical plans to reshape the US government if Trump wins.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This document is nothing more than an attempt to justify their efforts to suppress the vote, undermine the election, and ultimately another January 6,\u201d he said in a statement.",

        "text": "July 12, 2024, presidential campaign news\nRadio host Earl Ingram appears on CNN on July 12. CNN\n\nA Milwaukee radio host on Friday apologized for agreeing to a request from the Biden campaign to make edits to an interview he recorded with the president earlier this month.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett that will air on \u201cLaura Coates Live,\u201d WAUK-AM host Earl Ingram said if he had to do it all over again, he would have said \u201cabsolutely not\u201d to the campaign.\n\nWhen asked if he felt pressured by the campaign, he described being flattered when presented with the \u201copportunity to interview the most powerful man in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was the fact that I was getting this opportunity and let my guard down, if you will, and made a mistake, learned some valuable lessons from that, and hope to never repeat it again,\u201d he said.\n\nIngram told CNN that he used four out of five questions given to him by the campaign, but couldn\u2019t say whether he asked them word-for word. He said the questions were largely about the Black community.\n\nCivic Media, the Wisconsin-based radio network that hosts Ingram\u2019s show, released the edited clips and the entire unedited interview on Thursday. A Biden campaign spokesperson acknowledged it had asked the station to edit the interview.\n\nThe edited clips, it said, included Biden saying: \u201c\u2026and in addition to that, I have more Blacks in my administration than any other president, all other presidents combined, and in major positions, cabinet positions.\u201d\n\nA reference to former President Donald Trump\u2019s call for the death penalty for the so-called Central Park Five was also removed. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they even call for their hanging or not, but he\u2013but they said [\u2026] convicted of murder,\u201d Biden said.\n\nIngram, who noted that the station has put things in place that will prevent a similar situation from occurring going forward, said Friday that he doesn\u2019t understand how the things Biden said would be \u201cmet with so much consternation as it is today.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether he was offended by Biden\u2019s comments, the radio host insisted that the president is working to address disparities between Black and White Americans.\n\n\u201cPresident Biden, even with those faux pas, is a guy who\u2019s making an effort and attempting to do something to address those issues,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo, no, those things did not irritate me or upset me, or I think most Blacks.\u201d",

        "text": "Will Biden drop out? Key questions on his presidential campaign\nAs he addressed reporters at the conclusion of the Nato conference on Thursday, Joe Biden sent a defiant message to his critics: I\u2019m not going anywhere. Despite demands from dozens of Democratic lawmakers that he withdraw from the presidential race following his disastrous debate performance, Biden argued he was the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump in November.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m the most qualified person to run for president. I beat him once, and I will beat him again,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThere\u2019s a long way to go in this campaign, and so I \u2013 I\u2019m just going to keep moving.\u201d\n\nThat message did not assuage some skeptics in Biden\u2019s party, as three more House Democrats called on the president to drop out in the hours after the press conference. Biden and his team have not yet quieted critics\u2019 concerns, but the president\u2019s detractors have few options beyond their public pressure campaign to get him to step aside.\n\nWith just one month left before the Democrats convene in Chicago for their convention, the party has limited time to determine who will be on the top of the ticket in November.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about Biden\u2019s path forward:\n\nHow many Democratic lawmakers are calling on Biden to drop out of the race? At least 19 congressional Democrats \u2013 18 House members and one senator \u2013 have publicly called on Biden to withdraw from the race as of Friday morning. Although those lawmakers represent a relatively small fraction of the more than 200 Democrats on Capitol Hill, their damning statements have intensified scrutiny of Biden and his ability to serve another four years as president. \u201cI understand why President Biden wants to run,\u201d Senator Peter Welch wrote in a Washington Post op-ed. \u201cHe saved us from Donald Trump once and wants to do it again. But he needs to reassess whether he is the best candidate to do so. In my view, he is not.\u201d\n\nWhat do voters think about Biden\u2019s candidacy? A clear majority of voters believe Biden should step aside, but Democrats specifically have more mixed views on the subject. According to a Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll released Thursday, 67% of Americans, including 56% of Democrats, say Biden should step aside and let someone else run for president. In comparison, a Reuters/Ipsos poll released last Tuesday showed 32% of Democrats saying Biden should withdraw from the race. If the proportion of Democrats calling on Biden to drop out continues to grow, the president\u2019s already vulnerable position in the party could become untenable. That being said, the concerns about Biden\u2019s fitness for office do not appear to have fundamentally reshaped the race for the presidency. The Post-ABC-Ipsos poll showed Biden and Trump each capturing 46% of the vote, a result that is essentially unchanged since April. A hypothetical match-up between Trump and the vice-president, Kamala Harris, also appears to be a virtual tie, with 49% of voters supporting Harris and 47% backing Trump.\n\nHas Biden given any indication that he plans to drop out? No. Biden has instead planned a campaign blitz across the coming days to demonstrate his ability to deliver a convincing pitch for re-election. On Monday, he will visit Austin, Texas, to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act, and he will also sit down for an interview with the NBC News anchor Lester Holt. \u201cI\u2019m determined on running, but I think it\u2019s important that I allay fears by letting them see me out there,\u201d Biden said on Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m going out in the areas where we think we can win, where we can persuade people to move our way.\u201d\n\nCan Biden\u2019s critics force him out of the race? They have few options to do so. Presidential primary voting has already concluded in all US states, so the delegates going to the Democratic convention are the only people who can nominate another candidate at this point. But of the roughly 4,000 delegates bound for Chicago, nearly 3,900 of them are pledged to Biden because of his strong performance in the primaries. Biden said on Thursday that the delegates pledged to him can \u201cdo whatever they want\u201d at the convention, but it is a bit more complicated than that. Elaine Kamarck, a member of the Democratic national committee rules committee and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, notes that current party rules state: \u201cDelegates elected to the national convention pledged to a presidential candidate shall in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them.\u201d Kamarck wrote on Thursday: \u201cFew, if any, delegates to recent conventions have ever sought to test [the rule]. But if worries about President Biden\u2019s ability to run and to serve continue to grow, along with fears of handing the presidency over to Donald Trump, some delegates may find themselves tempted to vote for someone else.\u201d\n\nHow long does Biden have to decide if he will stay in the race? The Democratic convention begins 19 August, but the party may formally nominate a candidate before then. Before Biden\u2019s poor debate performance, the Democratic National Committee already planned to virtually nominate a candidate to meet an Ohio ballot deadline of 7 August, but no date has been officially announced for the roll call vote. Because of the Ohio deadline, Democrats have even less time than it might appear to determine who their nominee will be.",

        "text": "After Biden's debate performance, the presidential race is unchanged\nAfter Biden's debate performance, the presidential race is unchanged\n\nLoading...\n\nThe race for the presidency remains statistically tied despite President Biden\u2019s dismal debate performance two weeks ago, a new national NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll finds.\n\nBiden actually gained a point since last month\u2019s survey, which was taken before the debate. In this poll, he leads Trump 50% to 48% in a head-to-head matchup. But Biden slips when third-party options are introduced, with Trump holding the slightest advantage with 43% to 42%.\n\nThose numbers, though, do not represent statistically significant differences, as the margin of error in the survey is +/- 3.1 percentage points, meaning results could be 3 points higher or lower.\n\nThe poll also found that, at this point, no other mainstream Democrat who has been mentioned as a replacement for the president on the ticket does better than Biden.\n\nThe results reflect the hyperpolarized political environment in the country and the reality that both of the major parties\u2019 presumptive nominees bring with them significant disadvantages. Majorities of those surveyed continue to say they have a negative opinion of both men, and neither, they say, should be on the ballot at all.\n\n\u201cThis is an unpleasant rematch with two unpopular people,\u201d said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, \u201cbut Biden gets points for honesty and character. As a result, there\u2019s a lot of canceling out.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nNearly two-thirds of the more than 1,300 respondents said they believe Biden lacks the mental fitness to be president. That includes almost 4 in 10 Democrats.\n\nLoading...\n\nBut the survey also found that by a 2-to-1 margin, 68% to 32%, people said it\u2019s more concerning to have a president who doesn\u2019t tell the truth than one who might be too old to serve.\n\nLoading...\n\nA majority said Biden has the character to be president (52%), while a majority also said Trump does not (56%).\n\nLoading...\n\nStill, nearly 6 in 10 believe Trump will win, including a quarter of Democrats, and national polls are far less important than in the most competitive states. A Democratic presidential candidate typically needs a wider margin in national polls for that to translate to an Electoral College victory because of the nature of swing states. They, in general, lean more conservative than the country at large because Democratic votes are concentrated on the coasts.\n\nA race likely to be decided on the margins\n\nSince the debate, on average, polls have shown Biden slipping a couple of points, but pollsters generally say it takes a couple of weeks for public opinion to settle after a major political event \u2014 and the changes have been within the margin of error.\n\nPlus, while some Democratic leaders have called for Biden to step aside \u2014 and an even larger number are very concerned about his chances \u2014 there has also been significant pushback from many rank-and-file voters on the left, who see unbalanced media scrutiny since the debate on Biden\u2019s flaws as compared to Trump\u2019s.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThat said, politicians tend to be good political weathervanes, with their own high-quality polling, and several of the Democratic House members who have advocated for Biden to leave the race are from competitive swing districts.\n\nThird parties pull younger voters, Biden doing better with those most likely to vote\n\nWhen third parties are factored in, Trump and Biden are statistically tied, with Trump at 43% and Biden 42%.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. pulled 8%, tied for the lowest support for him since Marist started including him in the survey in April. Professor Cornel West, running as an independent, got 3%, and Green Party candidate Jill Stein received 2%.\n\nA significant area of concern for Biden is younger voters. Biden drops 13 points with Gen Z/Millennials when third-party candidates are factored in.\n\nIn fact, 1 in 5 Gen Z/Millennials choose a third-party candidate when the option is offered, higher than any other age group. But they are the least-likely age group to say they are definitely going to vote.\n\nBiden is actually being buoyed by high-propensity voters. That\u2019s a change from past election cycles when low-turnout elections were thought to favor Republicans.\n\nTrump and Biden are tied, 45% to 45%, with the voters who say they are definitely voting. But Biden is doing better with older votes and white voters with college degrees than he did in 2020. Traditionally, those are two groups that have had among the highest participation rates of any voting blocs.\n\nBiden\u2019s approval rating overall is 43%, but it jumps to 47% with those who say they are definitely voting.\n\n\n\nIf not Biden, who else?\n\nThis question may be at the heart of why even more Democratic officials have not called for Biden to step aside.\n\nAt this point, no other Democrat tested does better and all are statistically tied with Trump, too.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, the most likely successor if Biden were to decide against continuing his campaign, also gets 50% compared to 49% for Trump. California Gov. Gavin Newsom mirrors Biden at 50% to 48% over Trump. And Trump and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer are at 49% to 49%.\n\nLoading...\n\nSo there is no clear Democratic alternative, though, as Democrats who have called for Biden to step aside would argue, those candidates could all make the case more coherently for themselves and the party.\n\nPollsters also expect that Trump will likely get a bounce from the Republican convention, as is the case traditionally in the days and weeks following a convention. That may set off yet another round of Democratic concerns and calls for Biden to step aside in the month until the Democrats\u2019 convention in Chicago in August.\n\n\u2014\n\nThe survey of 1,309 adults was conducted Tuesday and Wednesday by phone, text and online and in both English and Spanish. It has a margin of error of +/- 3.1 percentage points.",

H.R. 8281, the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, introduced by Congressman Chip Roy (R-TX-21), passed the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday by a vote of 221 to 198.\n\n\n\n\u201cPreservation of our Republic necessitates free, fair, and honest elections,\u201d said Congressman Moran. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said a number of times as a County Judge in Texas, what we need are SALTY elections \u2013 Secure, Accurate, Legal, Transparent elections with \u2018You,\u2019 the American citizen involved in every step of the way. Right now, in America, there is growing distrust in election results because of growing abuses and documented instances of election fraud. And yet, there are continuing efforts to allow illegal immigrants to participate in our federal elections when it is already against the law. This is incomprehensible to me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe SAVE Act makes commonsense reforms to preserve integrity in our elections,\u201d continued Congressman Moran. \u201cThis bill requires proof of citizenship when individuals register to vote and removes non-citizens from voter rolls, ensuring accountability in our federal election process nationwide. This legislation also empowers citizens to a private right of action to bring civil suits against election officials who fail to uphold the proof of citizenship requirement for those registering to vote.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBy passing the SAVE Act, the House has taken an important step to ensure every single American vote counts with full measure. I applaud Congressman Roy for bringing this action,\u201d concluded Congressman Moran.\n\n\n\nClick HERE to view Congressman Moran\u2019s full remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the beginning of 2021, more than 10 million illegal immigrants have crossed the border into the United States. Amid growing abuse of the American federal election system, the House passed the SAVE Act to preserve election integrity and ensure only eligible American citizens vote. This bill requires proof of citizenship be presented in person upon registration to vote and makes certain that non-citizens are removed from existing voter rolls.\n\n\n\nFull text of the legislation can be found here.\n\n###",

        "text": "How America's allies are trying to 'Trump-proof' Nato's future\nUS allies try to 'Trump-proof' Nato - but is that even possible?\n\nAFP Donald Trump at a Nato summit in Brussels in 2018\n\nOnly one US president has been at the Nato summit in Washington this week, but the shadow of another - his predecessor - has loomed over this meeting of the world's most powerful military alliance. While the host Joe Biden has presided over a message of unity from the group's 32 members, the Nato-sceptic views of his rival for power, Donald Trump, have imbued conversations here with an urgency and an anxiety. At times the smiles from world leaders in the conference hall have felt fragile. Trump \u201changs over every conversation here\", said one Eastern European diplomat who asked to remain nameless. The Republican's election as president in November \"could change everything\u201d, the diplomat said. The fact that Mr Biden has been trying to fend off a political crisis over his frailty has only sharpened the sense that a second Trump term could bring far-reaching changes to an alliance forged in the ashes of the World War Two and still reliant on hard US military power to deter adversaries.\n\nSo does Nato need to \u201cTrump-proof\u201d itself - as some describe it - and if so, is it possible? There is a lot of evidence of efforts by Nato allies to reach out already to those in Trump\u2019s political orbit to try to manage relationships and limit what they would see as the potential damage of a second term. But others suggest something more unmanageable. Camille Grand, a French former official who was one of Nato\u2019s deputy leaders throughout the Trump administration, described himself as \u201cmuch more worried\u201d than colleagues who think a second term may be \u201cTrump [term] one on steroids\u201d but ultimately workable for the alliance. \u201cHe doesn't have the same sort of guardrails, he doesn't have the same sort of adults in the room. And he has around him a team that is trying to turn his instinct into policy,\u201d said Mr Grand, who is now a fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. Four members of visiting delegations, who asked to remain anonymous, told the BBC their concern was not necessarily that a Trump administration would withdraw entirely from Nato, as he has threatened before. What is Nato and which countries are members? Rather it is a fear that the US commitment to the alliance's core principle of collective security - \"all for one and one for all\", meaning any ally under attack can expect defence from the others - could wane. Trump\u2019s positions on Nato have veered erratically from outright hostility - portraying the alliance as a bunch of freeloading Europeans surviving off protection paid for by US taxpayers - to suggesting his outbursts are simply part of a cunning negotiating tactic to compel more of Nato\u2019s members to meet its defence spending targets. He has frequently tried to rally crowds of supporters with attacks on the organisation. As the summit began, he posted to his Truth Social network that when he started as president most Nato members were \u201cdelinquent\u201d until they \u201cpaid up\u201d due to his pressure.\n\nThe Ukraine war was the big topic at the summit\n\nBy the end of Trump\u2019s presidency, four more Nato countries had hit the alliance\u2019s guidelines of spending at least 2% of national income on defence. So far during President Biden\u2019s term, another 13 countries have reached the target. That progress is frequently touted by the Biden administration and its backers, although in reality much of the increase was triggered by Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. At a February campaign rally in South Carolina, Trump said he would let Russia \u201cdo whatever the hell they want\u201d to Nato countries that did not spend enough. That sparked outrage from some quarters in Washington, but privately his threats are said to have gone further. At a panel event in January, European Union commissioner Thierry Breton described a meeting he had attended in 2020 between Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. \u201cDonald Trump said to Ursula: \u2018You need to understand that if Europe is under attack, we will never come to help you and to support you. And by the way, Nato is dead. And we will leave, we will quit Nato.\u2019 \"It was the president of the United States of America,\u201d recalled Mr Breton. \u201cHe may come back.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign has been approached by the BBC with a request to confirm whether the account was accurate. Evelyn Farkas, a former senior official at the Pentagon in the Obama administration, believes there remains a real concern even over Nato\u2019s existence under Mr Trump. \u201cI think there is a danger with Trump that he tries to pull us out of Nato. I won't sugarcoat that,\u201d said Dr Farkas, now executive director at public policy think tank the McCain Institute. \u201cThe reality is Trump is dangerous to the alliance in that America is still the strongest economic, political, military power and Nato is stronger if Nato has the United States inside the alliance.\" But one of those familiar with the thinking in Trump\u2019s political orbit, Dan Caldwell from the right-wing think tank Defence Priorities, believes the former president's priority is to push European nations to invest more in their own militaries. \u201cI don't think he wants to withdraw from Nato, but he has said that the United States should re-evaluate its role and the purpose of Nato going forward,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only the former president but more and more national security experts on the right believe the United States has really no choice but to do less in Europe. So I think that there's some larger forces at play, that will eventually force the next president, regardless of who it is\u2026 to substantially pull back from Nato.\" The most detailed account of policy positions that might influence a second Trump term comes from an initiative being brought up by supporters and detractors of Trump alike. Overseen by the conservative Heritage Foundation, \u201cProject 2025\u201d is a 900-page detailed blueprint for a Republican president to usher in a sweeping overhaul of the executive branch.\n\nGetty Images Trump sees China as the greatest threat to US\n\nThe initiative says a future president should \u201ctransform Nato\u201d so that America\u2019s role is primarily for its nuclear deterrent, while other members should field \u201cthe great majority\u201d of conventional forces required to deter Russia. This is in keeping with the project\u2019s foreign policy position, seeing the main threat to US primacy as China and therefore calling for the next president to \u201cbring resolution to the foreign policy tensions\u201d sparked by Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Trump himself has equivocated over the war but has said he would end it in \u201c24 hours\u201d. He favours brokering a deal between Russia and Ukraine on terms that many Nato allies would see as surrender for Kyiv. Trump has partially disavowed Project 2025, saying he does not know who is behind it but many of his former officials had a hand in writing it, including a former acting defense secretary. Since Trump left office, the increase in the number of Nato members spending at least 2% of their income on defence has better insulated the alliance for the future, said Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Asked about \"Trump-proofing\", he said Congress had also moved to shield America's membership of Nato from the whims of the White House, in a law passed last year. \u201cWe clarified no president can unilaterally withdraw from Nato without a vote of approval from the Senate,\u201d Mr Coons told the BBC.\n\nMore on the US election",

        "text": "Highlights from the 2024 presidential election campaign: July 12\nRep. Mike Levin, D-Calif. told President Biden on a virtual call with members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Friday that he should step down as the Democratic nominee, according to three sources familiar with the call. It marks the first time that one of Biden\u2019s growing internal detractors confronted the president with their opposition to his reelection campaign.\n\nBiden had joined the call around noon to acknowledge the concerns that many Democrats in Congress had raised about his capabilities to serve a second term and to reaffirm that not only can he finish the campaign, but that he intends to win in November, according to one of the people, who like others, were granted anonymity to discuss a private call.\n\nRep. Mike Levin, D-Calif., speaks ahead of President Joe Biden at a campaign event in support Levin, Thursday, Nov. 3, 2022, in San Diego. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) Rep.

The call allowed for a few questions of the president, which is when Levin raised his hand to launch what was described as a soliloquy on what he\u2019d heard from his Southern California district, with voters telling him that the president should not be on top of the party\u2019s ticket for 2024.\n\nLevin, according to two of the people, then encouraged the president to listen to those constituents and step down.\n\nBiden responded in kind, according to one person, saying that he understands the threat Democrats face against GOP candidate Trump but that he had a plan to win. The president wanted to answer more member questions after that but the call was abruptly ended by the organizers.",

        "text": "These 3 Democrats didn\u2019t do better than Biden in this poll against Trump. They also didn\u2019t do any worse\nPresident Joe Biden has held his ground against Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump despite questions about Biden\u2019s mental fitness and calls for him to quit the 2024 race, according to the latest PBS News/NPR/Marist poll.\n\nIf the election were held today, 50 percent of U.S. registered voters said they would support Biden, while 48 percent said they would vote for Trump, the difference between the two falling within the margin of error.\n\nYet, a majority of Americans believe that Trump will win the election in November. And more than half think that neither Biden nor Trump should lead their respective party\u2019s White House tickets this year.\n\n\u201c\u2026 there\u2019s a crisis of confidence among Democrats that the president needs to address.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a race that didn\u2019t change much,\u201d said Amy Walter of the Cook Political Report with Amy Walter. \u201cIf you\u2019re Biden, this poll suggests you\u2019re in fine shape to continue.\u201d\n\nThough it\u2019s been a fraught election cycle for both presumptive nominees, turbocharged in recent weeks by Trump\u2019s felony conviction and Biden\u2019s muddled debate performance, these sentiments have remained virtually unchanged for nearly a year.\n\n\u201cThe survey shows that President Biden can still win this election, he just needs to convince Democrats \u2014 including those inclined to vote for him \u2014 that he can,\u201d said Navin Nayak, president of the Center for American Progress Action Fund. \u201cBased on this survey, what\u2019s most important is the actual vote hasn\u2019t changed since the debate, but there\u2019s a crisis of confidence among Democrats that the president needs to address.\u201d\n\nThe growing number of calls from Democratic lawmakers and donors for Biden to step aside in the 2024 race has fueled speculation about alternative candidates for the top of the party\u2019s ticket over the last two weeks.\n\nNearly two-thirds of Americans say Biden does not have the mental fitness to serve as president, while about half question Trump\u2019s acuity, according to this latest poll. At the same time, a majority of Americans say Trump does not have the character to serve as president. About half of Americans say Biden has the character to lead the nation.\n\nOverall, 59 percent of Americans think Trump will win in November, including nearly all Republicans, a majority of independents and nearly a quarter of Democrats.\n\nAt a Thursday news conference marking the end of the NATO summit in Washington, a reporter asked Biden whether he was concerned about damaging his decadeslong legacy in politics by choosing to stay in the race despite voter concerns.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not in this for my legacy. I\u2019m in this to complete the job I started,\u201d said Biden, who repeatedly doubled down on his commitment to stay at the top of the ticket.\n\nIn head-to-head comparisons against Trump in this poll, none of a given handful of other Democrats surpassed Biden\u2019s razor-thin lead, and all of them fell within the poll\u2019s margin of error. This survey did not attempt to include all possible contenders, but U.S. registered voters were asked about several prominent Democratic leaders.\n\nHow would other Democrats fare if Biden steps aside?\n\nIf the election were held today and Vice President Kamala Harris was the Democratic nominee running against Trump, 50 percent of respondents said they would vote for her, while 49 percent said they would vote for Trump.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have picked her if I didn\u2019t think she was qualified to be president,\u201d Biden said of Harris at the NATO news conference late Thursday.\n\nGavin Newsom, the Democratic governor of California, has also been floated as a potential contender. In this latest poll, 50 percent of voters said they would choose him if he were the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nominee, while 48 percent stood with Trump.\n\nIf Democrats instead went with Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who chairs Biden\u2019s reelection campaign, 49 percent of voters said they would back Whitmer. At the same time, 49 percent said they would support Trump. Whitmer has remained adamant that she stands by Biden and told the PBS News Hour\u2019s co-anchor Amna Nawaz that Biden \u201chas delivered for people.\u201d\n\nRepublican strategist Sarah Longwell said it is \u201cabsolutely not\u201d too late for Democrats to pick someone else to lead their party\u2019s ticket as they prepare for the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August.\n\n\u201cFour months is a lifetime,\u201d she said of the run-up to the November election, pointing out that neither Biden nor Trump are officially nominated yet.\n\nFor people who want to see someone other than Biden in the race for the White House, Walter said this latest poll \u201chas something good for you.\u201d Other contenders don\u2019t appear to do better than Biden, but they also don\u2019t do worse.\n\n\u201cIf tomorrow I show up at the convention, and they say they want someone else, that\u2019s the democratic process,\u201d Biden said Thursday before whispering, \u201cBut that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d\n\nThe 56 percent of Americans who say Biden should not lead the Democratic Party\u2019s bid for the White House includes a sizable minority of Democrats (40 percent), in addition to 61 percent of independents and 68 percent of Republicans. Younger Americans are more likely to feel this way than older Americans, according to this latest poll.\n\nSimilarly, 54 percent of Americans say Trump should not be the Republican Party\u2019s candidate in the 2024 presidential election. Younger Americans, especially those ages 18 to 29, were divided over whether or not Trump should be in this race. No serious contenders are in view for Trump, who will be formally named his party\u2019s nominee for president next week during the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\n\nMental fitness and character\n\nBiden\u2019s performance during the June 27 presidential debate against Trump prompted concerns that he may be mentally unfit to serve a second term in the White House.\n\n\u201cSo much about Biden and Trump is baked in,\u201d Walter said. \u201cThe real concern among Democrats \u2014 it\u2019s not that there\u2019s something new people will learn about Biden, but [that] what we saw on debate night is going to happen again. That\u2019s the risk.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, a Cook Political Report analysis of new polling data showed more voters in key battleground states leaning away from Biden after the debate.\n\nWATCH: New polls show Biden slipping further behind Trump in critical swing states\n\n\u201cI think voters got a lot of new information from that debate,\u201d said Longwell, who noted that the will of primary voters who had cast their ballots for Biden would not be diminished if Democrats switched to a different nominee.\n\n\u201cIf Joe Biden had a health event and had to step aside, nobody would say, \u2018Oh, the voters voted for him,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThey would say, \u2018Oh, he had a health event.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn May, Trump became the first former president in U.S. history to be convicted of a felony and continues to be the focus of multiple ongoing criminal and civil investigations, including allegations that he worked to overturn the 2020 presidential election.\n\nIn spite of these historic developments, just as many Americans say they have a favorable impression of Biden as they do Trump, at 43 percent for each candidate, a number that has largely held steady for much of the past year.\n\nWho will win, according to Americans right now\n\nYounger Americans were more likely than older Americans to think Trump stands the best chance of securing a second term as president in the current race. In this latest poll, 62 percent of adults ages 18 to 29 said Trump was most likely to win the election, significantly more than 55 percent of adults age 60 or older.\n\nMeanwhile, 39 percent of Americans believe Biden will return to the White House, including about three-quarters of Democrats and more than a third of independents.\n\nLooking at voter enthusiasm, 9 in 10 U.S. registered voters say they plan to vote in November.\n\nPBS News, NPR and Marist Poll conducted a survey on July 9 through July 10 that polled 1,309 U.S. adults with a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points, 1,174 registered voters with a margin of error of 3.3 percentage points and 954 registered voters who definitely plan to vote in November\u2019s general election with a margin of error of 3.6 percentage points.",

        "text": "Sharply More Americans Want to Curb Immigration to U.S.\nWASHINGTON, D.C. -- Significantly more U.S. adults than a year ago, 55% versus 41%, would like to see immigration to the U.S. decreased. This is the first time since 2005 that a majority of Americans have wanted there to be less immigration, and today\u2019s figure is the largest percentage holding that view since a 58% reading in 2001. The record high was 65%, recorded in 1993 and 1995.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nMost of the rise in resistance to immigration in the June 3-23 poll is offset by a 10-percentage-point decline in those saying they want increased immigration, now at 16%. There has also been a decline in those wanting to see immigration kept at its present level, down six points to 25%.\n\nThe shifts in attitudes have come after monthly illegal border crossings reached record levels late last year. They have dropped significantly since then, but remain above most monthly pre-pandemic totals. Gallup\u2019s monthly measure of the most important problem facing the country finds immigration consistently ranking among the top issues this year. Also, in the latest survey, 42% describe the situation at the U.S. border with Mexico as a crisis and 35% a major problem, although those figures are little changed from prior readings in 2019 and 2023.\n\nGallup has asked Americans about their preferred immigration levels since 1965. On average over that time period, 42% of Americans have favored reduced immigration, 35% preferred keeping the status quo, and 18% wanted increased immigration. Majorities previously favored reduced immigration in the early to mid-1990s, when California was struggling to deal with an influx of immigrants; in the year after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks; and in December 2005, after the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill aimed at border enforcement (which ultimately did not become law).\n\nAmericans\u2019 attitudes on immigration have changed greatly during the past four years. In 2020 and 2021, nearly as many wanted to see increased immigration (34%) as to keep the status quo (36%), with fewer favoring decreases (30%).\n\nAll Party Groups Show a Greater Preference for Immigration Cutbacks\n\nAlthough the desire for decreased immigration varies widely by party, all three groups are significantly more likely than a year ago to favor less immigration. This includes a 15-point increase among Republicans (to 88%), an 11-point increase among independents (to 50%) and a 10-point increase among Democrats (to 28%).\n\nRepublicans and independents are much more likely to say immigration should be reduced rather than increased or kept at its present level. Democrats are now most likely to prefer keeping immigration levels where they are, but last year they were about equally likely to favor keeping the status quo or increasing immigration.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nPublic Favors Variety of Policies to Address Immigration\n\nThe new poll shows Americans favoring several proposals that would attempt to restrict immigration, but they also favor policies that would allow some immigrants in the U.S. illegally to remain.\n\nSeventy-six percent are in favor of the U.S. hiring significantly more border patrol agents, and 63% favor allowing the president and the secretary of Homeland Security to temporarily prohibit individuals from seeking asylum when the U.S. Southwest border is overwhelmed.\n\nA slim majority of 53% favors expanding the construction of walls along the U.S. border, the first time a majority has been in favor of that policy.\n\nAmericans split on a policy to deport all immigrants living in the U.S. illegally back to their home countries.\n\nNotwithstanding their attitudes on deportation, 70% of U.S. adults favor allowing immigrants who entered the country illegally a chance to become U.S. citizens if they meet certain requirements over a period of time. Support is even higher -- 81% -- for a similar policy for those brought to the U.S. illegally as children.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nGallup measured public support for most of these immigration policies in 2018 or 2019, and finds support for the restrictive measures has risen since then. This includes a 13-point increase for expanding border walls (to 53%) and a 10-point increase for deporting all immigrants in the U.S. illegally (47%).\n\nIn contrast, support for allowing immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally to become citizens has fallen from 81% in 2019 to 70% today. There has been no change in opinions on hiring more border patrol agents since 2019 and allowing those brought to the U.S. illegally as children an opportunity to become citizens since 2018.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nThis is the first time Gallup has asked about a temporary pause on asylum applications, a step the Biden administration has recently taken and that was part of a bipartisan immigration bill that recently failed to pass in the U.S. Senate.\n\nRepublicans Favor More Restrictive Immigration Policies\n\nConsistent with their preferences for U.S. immigration levels, Republicans and Democrats have divergent views on immigration policies. Of the six policies tested in the survey, Republicans are most likely to favor hiring more agents and expanding the construction of border walls, while Democrats show the highest support for allowing children brought to the U.S. illegally, known as \u201cdreamers,\u201d the chance to stay in the U.S.\n\nRepublicans are alone in giving majority support for deporting all people in the U.S. illegally, and in expressing less-than-majority support for allowing those in the U.S. illegally the chance to become citizens. Republicans are joined by a slim majority of independents in favoring construction of more border walls, something only 17% of Democrats favor.\n\nMajorities of Republicans, Democrats and independents support three policies: hiring more border patrol agents, allowing the executive branch to suspend asylum claims when the border is overwhelmed, and allowing immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children the chance to stay and become citizens.\n\nOn all six policy proposals, Republicans\u2019 and Democrats\u2019 levels of support differ by at least 18 points. The largest gaps are on expanding border walls (74 points), deporting all immigrants in the U.S. illegally (62 points) and allowing those in the U.S. illegally the chance to become citizens (41 points).\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nParty groups\u2019 opinions of the following policies have changed significantly since 2019:\n\nThe percentage of Republicans in favor of deporting all immigrants in the U.S. illegally has increased by 21 points, from 63% in 2019 to 84% today.\n\nAt the same time, there has been a 24-point drop in Republican support for allowing immigrants in the U.S. illegally the chance to become citizens, from 70% to 46%.\n\nThere has been a 17-point increase in independents\u2019 support for significantly expanding the construction of walls along the U.S.-Mexico border, from 34% to 51%.\n\nAmericans, but Not Republicans, Retain Positive Opinions About Immigration\n\nMajorities of Americans have consistently described immigration as being a good rather than a bad thing for the country. Currently, 64% evaluate immigration positively and 32% negatively. The share with a positive view is down from the high of 77% in 2020 but remains above the low point of 52% in 2002, the first measurement after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nLess-positive views of immigration in the past four years have been driven largely by Republicans. Since 2020, the percentage of Republicans who say immigration is a good thing has dropped 23 points to 39%, a new low for Republicans. This is even lower than the 47% measured for Republicans after 9/11, when Americans overall had the least-positive views of immigration.\n\nIndependents show a smaller drop of 12 points since 2020, with 66% now describing immigration as a good thing. Democrats\u2019 views of immigration have not changed meaningfully; currently, 86% have a positive view.\n\nThe 47-point difference between Democratic and Republican opinions of immigration this year is the largest in Gallup\u2019s trend.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nImmigration Taking on Slightly Greater Importance as Election Issue\n\nTwenty-five percent of U.S. registered voters say a candidate must share their views on immigration in order to secure their vote. That is up slightly from 20% in 2015, the last time Gallup asked the question. Another 56% say immigration will be one of many important factors they take into account when voting this year, and 16% say it is not a major issue.\n\nRepublican registered voters are much more likely than Democratic and independent voters to say a candidate must share their views. Voters who prefer that immigration levels be decreased say the issue is more important to their vote than those who want levels kept the same or increased.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nThe 25% of registered voters who say a candidate must share their views on immigration include 11% who want levels decreased, 8% who want them increased and 6% who want them kept at their present level.\n\nBottom Line\n\nImmigration has been a greater concern for Americans, particularly Republicans, this year, after the record number of illegal border crossings last year. For the first time in nearly two decades, a majority of Americans want immigration levels to the U.S. reduced rather than kept at their present level or increased.\n\nThe issue could be a key factor in the fall elections. About one in four voters say they will vote only for candidates who share their position on the issue, though more say abortion will be a key voting issue for them than say this about immigration. But immigration, especially given its prominence on Americans\u2019 list of the most important problems facing the country, could also influence voters\u2019 evaluations of incumbent politicians running for reelection, particularly President Joe Biden, based on how well people think they are handling the issue.\n\nTo stay up to date with the latest Gallup News insights and updates, follow us on X @Gallup.\n\nLearn more about how the Gallup Poll Social Series works.\n\nView complete question responses and trends (PDF download).\n\n###Embeddable###",

        "text": "Biden Signs FY 2024 Spending Bill, Higher Education Funding Holds Steady\nSection 1 Content\n\n\u200bAfter months of delays, over the weekend Congress passed and President Biden signed a $1.2 trillion spending bill for the remainder of FY 2024 that includes funding for the Department of Education (ED) and some research agencies.\n\nWhile the legislation largely does not include additional funds for higher education programs, it avoids drastic cuts proposed by House Republicans. The package includes $79.1 billion in funding for ED, a $500 million decrease from FY 2023. It sustains funding for the Pell Grant program that keeps the maximum award at $7,395, and does not cut funding to the Federal Work-Study and Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant programs, as proposed by the House.\n\nEmmanual Guillory, ACE senior director of government relations, told Inside Higher Ed that while not ideal, the funding levels are pretty much what the higher education community expected.\n\n\u201cWe're happy we didn't see any more cuts, but we're advocating for the necessary increases, especially in areas where there's no accounting for inflation,\" he said. \u201cStill, we're seeing basically all level funding here. In a regulatory environment like this one, that's a win.\"\n\nAdditional highlights in the package include (compared to FY 2023):\n\nFunding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and Minority Serving Institutions was increased collectively by $7.5 million;\n\nThe Strengthening Institutions Program was decreased by $10 million;\n\nFunding for international education and foreign language programs is sustained;\n\nThe Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education saw an overall decrease of $13 million;\n\nFederal TRIO programs are sustained at $1.19 billion;\n\nPrograms such as Child Care Access Means Parents In School ($75 million), Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need ($23.55 million), and Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness in Undergraduate Programs ($388 million) were funded at the FY 2023 levels; and\n\nThe National Institutes of Health receives $48.6 billion (an increase of $300 million over FY 2023) and there is $1.5 million for the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, level with FY 2023 funding.\n\nEarlier this month, President Biden released his FY 2025 budget request, which would increase spending for many higher education programs. Congress has until Sept. 30 to approve FY 2025 funding.",

        "text": "U.S. intel officials: Russia wants to boost Trump in 2024 race\nShortly before the presidential debate two weeks ago, NBC News reported on a network of pro-Kremlin social media accounts that were \u201cattempting to spread false narratives.\u201d Not surprisingly, those narratives were intended to help Donald Trump.\n\nThis was not an isolated incident. The Wall Street Journal reported this week:\n\nThe Russian government has launched a \u201cwhole-of-government\u201d effort to influence the outcome of the U.S. presidential election and favors Republican candidate Donald Trump in the race, senior U.S. intelligence officials said Tuesday. The officials didn\u2019t mention Trump by name, but said that Russia\u2019s current activity \u2014 described as covert social-media use and other online propaganda efforts \u2014 mirrored the 2020 and 2016 election cycles, when Moscow also favored Trump and sought to undermine Democratic candidates, according to U.S. intelligence agencies.\n\nA senior official in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence told reporters, \u201cWe haven\u2019t observed a shift in Russia\u2019s preferences for the presidential race from past elections.\u201d\n\nThat seemed like a polite way of effectively saying, \u201cMoscow wanted Trump in power before, and Moscow wants Trump in power now.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Russia\u2019s interest in the outcomes of our election is especially acute right now because of the United States\u2019 support for Ukraine. Bret Schafer, a senior fellow at the Alliance for Securing Democracy of the German Marshall Fund, who tracks foreign disinformation efforts, told NBC News earlier this year, \u201cNot that they didn\u2019t have an incentive to interfere in the last two presidential elections. But I would say that the incentive to interfere is heightened right now.\u201d\n\nBut as Moscow\u2019s efforts come into focus, it\u2019s worth appreciating the familiarity of the circumstances.\n\nIn 2016, Russia targeted U.S. elections. There used to be a bipartisan consensus on this obvious and uncontested fact.\n\nIn 2018, Russia targeted U.S. elections. Though Trump, for reasons that have never been explained, rejected his own country\u2019s intelligence on the matter, the United States\u2019 top national security officials made it categorically clear that Russia took deliberate steps to interfere in the midterm cycle.\n\nIn 2020, Russia targeted U.S. elections. In fact, intelligence officials told Congress about the evidence showing that Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign for the express purpose of trying to secure a second term for Trump.\n\nIn 2022, Russia targeted U.S. elections. In fact, The Wall Street Journal reported last year, \u201cThe Russian government and its proxies attempted to denigrate the Democratic Party and undermine voter confidence ahead of the 2022 midterm elections.\u201d\n\nAnd in 2024, Russia is once against targeting U.S. elections.\n\nThe pattern isn\u2019t exactly subtle.\n\nBut as Rachel has explained on the show, one of the most important differences between the Kremlin\u2019s latest efforts and the Putin regime\u2019s earlier intelligence operations is that many Republican officials no longer bother with the pretense that Russian intervention is a problem.\n\nThis post updates our related earlier coverage.",

        "text": "Election Updates: At High-Stakes News Conference, Biden Vows to \u2018Finish the Job\u2019\nPinned\n\nPresident Biden on Thursday answered questions from reporters about foreign policy, whether he is up to defeating former President Donald J. Trump and why he is resisting calls from Democrats to end his candidacy, as he sought to recover from a crisis of confidence that has engulfed his campaign.\n\nWith a growing number of Democratic lawmakers, donors and elected officials urging Mr. Biden to drop out of the race after a disastrous debate performance last month, the closing news conference of a NATO summit in Washington became a high-stakes chance for the president to quiet concerns about his candidacy. The results were mixed.\n\nMr. Biden stumbled early but remained defiant in the face of questions about his fitness to continue his campaign. He struggled to articulate a cohesive case for his candidacy, even as he gave a forceful defense of his record and showed a strong command over foreign policy.\n\nHere are five takeaways:\n\nHe said he is not leaving.\n\nMr. Biden vowed to stay in the presidential race. \u201cI\u2019m determined on running,\u201d Mr. Biden said. He dismissed polling showing him losing to Mr. Trump and insisted, \u201cI think I\u2019m the best qualified person to do the job.\u201d But he also acknowledged that the schedule of the presidency had become challenging. \u201cI just got to, just, pace myself a little more,\u201d Mr. Biden said.\n\nVideo transcript Back bars 0:00 / 0:30 - 0:00 transcript \u201cThere has been reporting that you\u2019ve acknowledged that you need to go to bed earlier, end your evening around 8.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not true. Look, what I said was, instead of my every day starting at 7 and going to bed at midnight, it\u2019d be smarter for me to pace myself a little more. And I said, for example, the 8, 7, 6 stuff, instead of starting a fundraiser at 9 o\u2018clock, start at 8 o\u2018clock. People get to go home by 10 o\u2018clock. That\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d\n\nBefore the debate, he said, his schedule was \u201cfull-bore\u201d and he made the \u201cstupid mistake\u201d of too much travel and too many late nights before the debate. Mr. Biden also blamed his staff for the packed days. \u201cI love my staff,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cBut they add things. They add things all the time at the very end.\u201d\n\nHe got off to a rough start.\n\nMr. Biden\u2019s response to the first question contained the kind of fumble that has caused Democrats anxiety. Asked about the ability of Vice President Kamala Harris to defeat Mr. Trump, Mr. Biden said that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t have picked Vice President Trump to be vice president did I think she was not qualified to be president.\u201d\n\nVideo transcript Back bars 0:00 / 0:16 - 0:00 transcript \u201dWhat concerns do you have about Vice President Harris\u2019s ability to beat Donald Trump if she were at the top of the ticket?\u201c \u201dLook, I wouldn\u2019t have picked Vice President Trump to be vice president did I think she was not qualified to be president. So let\u2019s start there.\u201c\n\nHe also slipped while answering a question about military assistance to Ukraine, saying he follows the advice of his \u201ccommander in chief\u201d \u2014 which is the president \u2014 before correcting himself and mentioning his senior military commanders. For the most part, though, he avoided the kinds of prolonged, painful moments he experienced during the debate in which he was unable to complete a thought, even as he meandered at times in his answers.\n\nHe showed a command of foreign policy.\n\nIn the face of questions over his mental acuity, Mr. Biden showed he still had a strong grasp on substance when it came to global affairs. He gave long, detailed answers on various foreign policy matters, including when he said he was prepared to interrupt the relationship between China and Russia. \u201cWe have to make sure that Xi understands that there\u2019s a price to pay,\u201d Mr. Biden said, referring to President Xi Jinping of China.\n\nVideo transcript Back bars 0:00 / 0:58 - 0:00 transcript Xi believes that China is a large enough market that they can entice any country, including European countries, to invest there in return for commitments from Europe to do A, B, C or D or not to do certain things. China has to understand that if they are supplying Russia with information and capacity, along with working with North Korea and others to help Russia in armament, that they\u2019re not going to benefit economically. We have to make sure that Xi understands there\u2019s a price to pay for undercutting both the Pacific Basin as well as Europe and as it relates to Russia and dealing with Ukraine.\n\nHe reiterated his longstanding position that Ukraine should not be allowed to use American weapons to strike deep into Russia, including Moscow and the Kremlin. And he detailed his efforts to get humanitarian aid into Gaza, noting that Israel \u201coccasionally\u201d was \u201cless than cooperative.\u201d He also made the case for the global stakes of the election, saying fellow world leaders had told him that \u201cyou\u2019ve got to win\u201d because Mr. Trump would be a disaster for their countries.\n\nHe struggled to articulate why he is the best person to defeat Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Biden rambled while making the case for his candidacy, launching long-winded recitations of what he has accomplished as president and maintaining that he should have the chance to continue, but never landing on a concise message for why he is the best person to do so.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m determined on running,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s important that I real \u2014 I allay fears. I\u2019ve seen \u2014 let them see me out there, let me see them out, you know \u2014 for the longest time, it was, you know, \u2018Biden\u2019s not prepared to sit with us unscripted; Biden is not prepared to\u2019 \u2014 and anyway.\u201d\n\nHe then began ticking through statistics about the reach of his re-election campaign, and suggested that all the work would be for nothing if he left the race, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s awful hard to replace in the near term.\u201d He then veered into talking about his record in the Senate, adding, \u201cAnyway, I\u2019m going to be going around making the case of the things that I think we have to finish and how we can\u2019t afford to lose what we\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nHe said polls showed he was the strongest candidate to beat Mr. Trump, but also conceded for the first time that other Democrats could also do so. \u201cI believe I\u2019m the best qualified to govern and I think I\u2019m the best qualified to win, but there are other people who could beat Trump, too,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s awful to start from scratch.\u201d\n\nHe offered a strong defense of Kamala Harris.\n\nWhile he vowed to stay in the race, Mr. Biden also on multiple occasions defended the credentials of his vice president. He commended her work defending abortion rights and \u201cher ability to handle almost any issue on the board.\u201d But he also made clear that any polling showing Ms. Harris faring better in a matchup against Mr. Trump would not compel him to step down. \u201cUnless they came back and said there\u2019s no way you can win,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cNo one\u2019s saying that.\u201d",

        "text": "Apart From Biden And Trump, These Are 5 Other Key Candidates In US Elections\nDemocratic President Joe Biden and Republican former President Donald Trump will face each other in the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election, after a divisive, closely fought contest. Several third-party hopefuls are also running.\n\nHere is a list of the candidates:\n\nREPUBLICAN PARTY\n\nTrump, 78, became the first former U.S. president to be convicted of a crime when a Manhattan jury in May found him guilty of falsifying documents to cover up a payment to a porn star to silence her ahead of the 2016 election. He says he is innocent and will appeal the conviction.\n\nTrump's July 11 sentencing was postponed until Sept. 18 after he asked for a chance to argue he should have been immune from prosecution following a July Supreme Court ruling that presidents are entitled to immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts.\n\nOn Monday, the Republicans National Convention convenes to formally nominate the former president to face Biden in what would be the first presidential rematch in nearly 70 years. The party mirrored Trump's views in its new policy platform.\n\nTrump, in office from 2017-2021, has leveraged his unprecedented legal challenges to solidify support among his base and has cast his third bid for the White House in part as \"retribution\" against perceived political enemies.\n\nBut after his felony conviction, 10% of Republican and 25% of independent registered voters said they were less likely to vote for him, Reuters/Ipsos polling found.\n\nTrump faces 54 charges in three other criminal cases: a federal case involving efforts to subvert the 2020 election, a Georgia election interference case and a federal case in Florida over his handling of classified documents after leaving office. He denies any wrongdoing.\n\nHowever, he is unlikely to face any other trials before the Nov. 5 election. July's Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity makes it improbable that Trump will be tried on federal criminal charges regarding efforts to undo the 2020 election loss to Biden before voters cast their ballots.\n\nTrump has refused to commit to accepting the 2024 election results or to rule out possible violence around the Nov. 5 contest or his sentencing and is already laying the groundwork to contest a potential election loss.\n\nHe calls his supporters jailed for the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol \"hostages\" and \"warriors,\" and uses increasingly dystopian rhetoric, including calling his enemies \"vermin.\"\n\nIf elected, Trump has vowed \"revenge\" on his political enemies and said he would not be a dictator except \"on day one,\" later calling that \"a joke.\"\n\nHe also wants the power to replace federal civil service workers with loyalists, while a consortium of Trump-friendly think tanks touts a sweeping policy agenda known as \"Project 2025\" that takes aim at diversity programs and the Justice Department's independence, among other reported plans. Trump has sought to distance himself from the plan.\n\nOn foreign policy, Trump sparked criticism from Western leaders for saying the U.S. would not defend NATO members that did not spend enough on defense and that he would encourage Russia to attack them. He has also questioned military aid for Ukraine.\n\nTrump has made immigration a top domestic campaign issue, vowing to carry out mass deportations with the National Guard and possibly federal troops, end birthright citizenship, and expand a travel ban on people from certain countries.\n\nHe has referred to some migrants as \"animals\" who are \"poisoning the blood of our country,\" among other inflammatory remarks, and has not ruled out building detention camps on U.S. soil. But foreigners who graduate from a U.S. college would get a green card allowing them to stay, he said, which his campaign later said would only apply to the \"most skilled\" graduates who had been vetted.\n\nOn abortion, Trump takes credit for the U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade and has said abortion should remain a state issue.\n\nWhile he has criticized some Republican-led state actions such as those in Florida and Arizona, he said he would allow Republican-led states to track women's pregnancies and prosecute those who violate their state bans. Trump has said he does not support a ban on access to birth control.\n\nHe promised to eliminate Obamacare health insurance before saying on April 11 that he would not \"terminate\" it. On education, he has pledged to halt federal funding to schools with vaccine mandates and to eliminate the U.S. Department of Education. He has also vowed to undo much of the Biden administration's work to fight climate change.\n\nDEMOCRATIC PARTY\n\nBiden has cast himself as the country's best hope to defend American liberties and protect democracy, saying Trump is unhinged and threatens the future of the country.\n\nWhile he faced no serious challenger in the Democratic primaries, his weak performance at the first presidential debate against Trump has prompted some Democrats to call for him to step aside as the party prepares to formally nominate him.\n\nAlready the oldest U.S. president ever at 81, Biden must now convince his own party as well as voters that he is more fit for office than Trump, who is just three years his junior.\n\nOne in three Democrats think Biden should end his reelection bid following the debate, but no prominent elected Democrat does any better than Biden in a hypothetical match-up against Trump, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released in July.\n\nThe July Reuters/Ipsos poll puts both Biden and Trump on 40% among registered voters, suggesting that Biden had not lost ground since the debate. Trump leads Biden in many battleground states, several other polls have shown.\n\nThe economy will also likely be a major factor in determining whether Biden returns to the White House amid low approval ratings.\n\nWhile the U.S. escaped an anticipated recession and is growing faster than economists expected, voters have been disenchanted with rising food costs, higher fuel prices and elevated interest rates, even as more recent data shows consumer prices moderating and inflation cooling.\n\nBiden pushed through massive economic stimulus and infrastructure spending packages to boost U.S. industrial output but has received next to no credit from voters so far.\n\nHis campaign has highlighted new semiconductor manufacturing plants, housing plans and other economic efforts. Two labor groups, the United Auto Workers Union and the North America's Building Trade Union, have endorsed him while the Teamsters have yet to announce which candidate they are backing. Three groups representing older Americans have also endorsed Biden.\n\nAlong with Vice President Kamala Harris, Biden has zeroed in on abortion as a top issue. They also created a new coalition to court Black voters, a critical voting bloc.\n\nBiden's handling of immigration policy has been criticized by Republicans and some Democrats as he has struggled with millions of migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nIn June, he signed an executive order to curb migration along the southern border. He also announced a new path for citizenship for certain immigrants in the country illegally who are married to U.S. citizens.\n\nThe president has led the response of Western governments to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, persuading allies to punish Russia and support Kyiv, including at NATO's summit in Washington. He also secured additional funding from Congress.\n\nBiden has provided military aid to Israel after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack while urging more humanitarian assistance for Palestinians as a May Reuters/Ipsos poll found Democrats remain divided over the issue.\n\nHe has faced criticism from many Democrats and younger voters for continuing to give weapons to Israel while largely failing to curb Israel's deadly military offensive in Gaza. Biden has presented a new Israeli proposal for a fresh Gaza ceasefire in exchange for the release of hostages while talks to end the conflict continue.\n\nBest-selling author and self-help guru Marianne Williamson, 72, relaunched her long-shot 2024 presidential bid earlier this year focusing on \"justice and love\" less than one month after dropping out.\n\nIn a February statement, she said she was getting back in to fight Trump's \"dark and authoritarian vision\" after earlier suspending it because she was losing \"the horse race.\"\n\nWilliamson previously ran as a Democrat in the 2020 presidential primary but dropped out before voting began.\n\nINDEPENDENTS\n\nAn anti-vaccine activist and environmental advocate, Kennedy, 70, is running as an independent after initially challenging Biden for the Democratic nomination but missed the deadline to qualify for the first presidential debate.\n\nWhile he lags in overall polling, Kennedy could siphon votes from Trump and Biden, with a June Reuters/Ipsos poll showing he was backed by 10% of respondents.\n\nThe son of Democratic U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1968 during his own presidential bid, Kennedy has drawn rebukes from his famous family, which endorsed Biden.\n\nKennedy, who chose wealthy lawyer Nicole Shanahan as his running mate, supports Israel and questioned a six-week ceasefire backed by Biden.\n\nHe said he views the U.S. southern border situation as a humanitarian crisis and opposes Trump's border wall. He has also vowed to repeal parts of Biden's climate bill over tax breaks he says help the oil industry.\n\nKennedy has taken different positions on abortion rights, including restrictions on when a woman can access an abortion. He told Reuters he thought every abortion was a \"tragedy\" but that it should be a woman's right \"throughout the pregnancy.\"\n\nHe has been criticized for making false medical claims over the years on vaccines but says he would still allow Americans to access them.\n\nAsked about an alleged sexual assault, he said in July that he has \"so many skeletons in my closet.\" His campaign has also said Kennedy had a brain worm more than a decade ago but he has fully recovered.\n\nKennedy's campaign has said he is officially on the ballot in a handful of states so far, including California, Michigan and Utah, although he faces a challenging, costly battle to be listed in all 50.\n\nThe political activist, philosopher and academic is making a third-party bid for president that is most likely to appeal to progressive, Democratic-leaning voters.\n\nWest, 71, initially ran as a Green Party candidate but said in October that people \"want good policies over partisan politics\" and declared himself an independent. He has promised to end poverty and guarantee housing.\n\nGREEN PARTY\n\nJill Stein, a physician who ran under the Green Party in 2016, is trying once again in 2024.\n\nShe launched her current campaign accusing Democrats of betraying their promises \"for working people, youth and the climate again and again - while Republicans don't even make such promises in the first place.\"\n\nStein, 74, raised millions of dollars for recounts after Trump's surprise 2016 victory. Her allegations yielded only one electoral review in Wisconsin that showed Trump had won.\n\nLIBERTARIAN PARTY\n\nWhile the Libertarian Party invited both Trump and Kennedy to speak at their convention in late May, it ultimately selected Chase Oliver, 38. Oliver ran for a Georgia state Senate seat in 2022 and garnered 2% of the vote.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "If you\u2019re in the military, voting this year could be tricky\nIt was time to vote in the 2020 election and Megan Paone, a U.S. military spouse, was stationed in Okinawa, Japan. Everything seemed straightforward: Request an absentee ballot, fill it out and send it back. When the ballot arrived, Paone made sure to fill it out and mail it back the next day to ensure it got back to her home state of South Dakota in time.\n\nSome time later when Paone went to her county supervisor\u2019s website to look up her ballot identification number, it said her ballot had been \u201creceived but not counted.\u201d\n\nIntrigued, she sent an email to the county supervisor of elections, but did not get a response.\n\n\u201cWhen I first married my service member, I was like, \u2018Oh my God, it\u2019s going to be so easy to vote because we\u2019re military and it should just be an easier process for us,\u2019\u201d Paone said. \u201cBut actually, it is not at all. It can be complicated, especially with different deadlines from state to state. It\u2019s kind of like a Whac-A-Mole.\u201d\n\nAs a voting bloc, the military community is sizable: There are nearly 1.3 million active-duty troops, and that\u2019s not taking their spouses and any other household adults into account. But the military community votes at much lower rates than their civilian counterparts. In 2022, only 26 percent of active-duty military voted compared to 46.2 percent of the general population \u2014 even though about 75 percent are eligible to vote absentee with special protections because of their station location or deployment status. The 19th spoke to several military spouses and election advocates who said the reasoning is layered: Military families move often and have to navigate varying and changing state laws, administrative hurdles and a lack of resources.\n\nPaone, now 46 and living in the Tampa Bay region of Florida, said she\u2019s moved eight times in the last 10 years with her husband, who is an active-duty Army officer. For her, voting was always a priority, so she did the research; figured out where, when and how to register to vote; and obtained a new driver\u2019s license in places that required voters to show proof of identity.\n\nShe did this in part because service members are not allowed to vote in person on military installations, embassies or consulates.\n\n\u201cEvery post that we have been to offers a lifestyle that people can get used to, including grocery stores, pharmacies, hospitals, clinics, libraries, waterparks \u2014 I mean everything that you need to live a good, productive life is available on post,\u201d Paone said. \u201cThe only thing you cannot do right now is vote.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the logistical barriers that might discourage voter participation, Streyder said there\u2019s also a lack of voting resources and overall motivation.\n\nThe majority of military voters vote using absentee ballots and are given special considerations under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, which was established in 1986 and updated in 2009. The act requires that states send blank ballots to service members and others overseas at least 45 days before federal elections, offer at least one method of electronic transmission of voting information and blank ballots, and transmit requested ballots automatically within the calendar year.\n\nThe Federal Voting Assistance Program administers the federal responsibilities of the bill, which are to provide nonpartisan information about voter registration and the absentee voting process to military and overseas voters, establish volunteer voting assistance officers at each base and remind states of their requirements when interacting with military and overseas voters. However, many in the military community are unaware that these resources even exist.\n\nThe Department of Defense did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication.\n\nWith these federal protections and programs in place, the number of military voters who report not receiving a ballot in time \u2014 or at all \u2014 has steadily decreased each year. But there are still more challenges that military voters typically have to face when trying to participate in elections.\n\nFor instance, the state legislative landscape shifted following 2020, with states going in two very different directions when it comes to voting, according to Sarah Streyder, the executive director of Secure Families Initiative, a group for military spouses dedicated to mobilizing the military community to vote.\n\nThere are states that started to codify things like voting by mail to make it more available on a permanent basis after creating temporary provisions during the COVID-19 pandemic, Streyder said. Then, she said, there are those that have decreased the window of opportunity for people to both register and return their absentee ballots.\n\n\u201c2020 taught us that our voters are like a canary in the coal mine in some ways,\u201d said Streyder, who is married to an active-duty Space Force Guardian. \u201cWe are some of the most vulnerable voters to some of these policies. But if we make policies more robust for us, they\u2019re going to benefit more than just us. I also want non-military civilians to be able to vote seamlessly.\u201d\n\nThe states that have decreased the time service members have to register and return their ballots are making it even more difficult for military voters to get their ballots counted, Streyder said. In at least 28 states voters will face restrictions that weren\u2019t in place in the last presidential election, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. Ohio and Tennessee, for instance, shortened the window of time that a ballot can arrive after election day and still be counted. Alabama and Idaho passed laws that broadly criminalize certain forms of assistance with absentee voting. An Arizona law shortens the period in which voters can fix issues with signatures on mail ballots. And in West Virginia, county clerks are now required to cancel the registration of voters who get out-of-state driver\u2019s licenses.\n\nThe active-duty military population is not a monolith. It is racially diverse \u2014 representative of the country as a whole \u2014 and young, with the majority being younger than 30. (Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cI think a common myth that I\u2019ve encountered amongst civilian voters and lawmakers is that the military votes at high rates because of a sense of civic service,\u201d Streyder said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve found this argument for voting flounders with the actively serving military audience \u2014 whether it\u2019s the service member or their loved one \u2014 because our entire lives are already fully committed to this concept of service. The idea that there\u2019s an additional obligation on top of all of this can sometimes be really hard to agree to.\u201d\n\nFor starters, voter registration is one of just many things a family might have to consider after a move. \u201cI put effort into voting, but I am probably an anomaly,\u201d Paone said. \u201cWhen people move for the military, registering for an election is not top of mind for individuals or families. It\u2019s \u2018Where am I going to live? What school are my kids going to? I need to find primary care.\u2019\u201d\n\nOther members of the military community sometimes feel insufficient, Streyder said. They don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re up to speed enough to weigh in on local issues or they don\u2019t feel like they should have a say in a community when they\u2019ll only be stationed there for a few years at most.\n\nTo motivate all of these types of voters, Streyder said she highlights why voting is in their best interest and how it\u2019s one of the rare opportunities in the military to have a say in who their future boss or commander in chief will be.\n\n\u201cI try to encourage folks to remember that you\u2019ve lived all around the world, which has given you a really broad perspective about what\u2019s possible, what forms of government can look like, what quality of life can look like that may be different from a more limited vantage point. That is a value add and a gift that you get to give your civilian neighbors back home when you vote,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen military voters do cast their ballots, most opt for absentee voting. But a small percentage register to vote wherever they\u2019re living, despite the increasing complexity that typically comes with that.\n\nFor example, Ellie Walker, a military spouse currently based in Georgia, said having children is a big motivator in her decision to re-register and vote locally wherever they move because she wants to make sure she has a say in issues that directly impact her family.\n\n\u201cIt is up to me to do my due diligence wherever I\u2019m being stationed,\u201d said Walker, who has moved five times in the last 12 years. \u201cIf I want to vote there, I need to know what\u2019s happening in the communities we live in. It has fallen on me. We are a family of color \u2014 so what our community looks like and the leaders that are there impact our experience while we\u2019re stationed there. So if I don\u2019t vote, I\u2019m choosing to be silent.\u201d\n\nThe active-duty military population is not a monolith. It is racially diverse \u2014 representative of the country as a whole \u2014 and young, with the majority being younger than 30. More than 90 percent of military spouses are women.\n\nSign up for more news and context delivered to your inbox, daily You have been subscribed!

She said participating in elections is an integral way to shift military culture.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a stance [military spouses] can take because we don\u2019t wear the uniform,\u201d Walker said. \u201cWhereas there\u2019s things that you still can\u2019t speak out on when you\u2019re on active duty. So it\u2019s up to military spouses or families to speak up on these issues, and I\u2019ll be happy to step into that role.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to getting more people in her community to vote, Walker said it\u2019s important to let people know that there are resources available, whether on the Federal Voting Assistance Program website or through advocacy groups, like Secure Families Initiative, and to keep reiterating the importance of voting, even amid the moving and the deployments.\n\n\u201cWhether we\u2019re in a presidential election or not, you want to have an impact in your community because your community impacts you,\u201d Walker said. \u201cIt\u2019s a mutual relationship.\u201d\n\nWalker said her husband, a Coast Guard recruiter, put cards on his desk with QR codes to help people register to vote. When he talks to potential recruits, he ends the conversation by asking if they know if they\u2019re registered to vote and offers the card with more resources.\n\n\u201cWe started getting our recruiters and frontline members talking to new people joining \u2014 that\u2019s also an additional grassroots effort to increase the turnout,\u201d Walker said. \u201cIt takes everybody.\u201d",

        "text": "Progressives look to Supreme Court to motivate voters in 2024 race\nWashington \u2014 On the heels of the Supreme Court's conclusion of its momentous term earlier this month, progressive groups are pouring millions into offensives that seek to make the nation's highest court a galvanizing issue for voters in November.\n\nThe campaigns highlight the court's recent decisions on presidential immunity, agency regulatory power and guns, as well as the prospect that if elected to a second term, former President Donald Trump could appoint new and young justices who would sit on the Supreme Court for decades to come.\n\nBy focusing on educating voters about the impact the next president will have on the high court, progressives hope to mobilize them to cast their ballots for the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, President Biden, even amid concerns from members of the party over his fitness for a second term following his poor performance in the debate against Trump last month.\n\n\"The same way people on the right have been Supreme Court voters because they were focused on the freedoms they wanted the Supreme Court to take away from us, we are motivating folks who care about preserving our freedoms to be a Supreme Court voter and to ensure Trump cannot appoint more justices to this court,\" said Christina Harvey, executive director of the progressive advocacy group Stand Up America.\n\nTwo years after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, Stand Up America rolled out a seven-figure campaign highlighting the court and the next president's potential stamp on it. Called \"Supreme Court Voter,\" the initiative warns of the impacts the conservative majority could have on future cases involving abortion, gun laws and voting rights.\n\nUnited for Democracy, a coalition of 140 advocacy groups, launched its own $10 million campaign in May that aims to draw a line between the Supreme Court and Trump, who appointed three of its six conservative justices. Called \"Stop the Relentless Power Grab,\" the initiative is a nod to the court's decision this term in a pair of cases \u2014 one called Relentless, Inc. v. Department of Commerce \u2014 that curtailed the power of federal agencies to interpret and fill gaps in the laws passed by Congress.\n\nIn addition to that ruling, the court also invalidated a Trump-era ban on bump stock devices that attach to semi-automatic rifles, narrowed a federal obstruction law used to charge hundreds of Jan. 6 defendants and Trump, and found that a former president is immune from federal prosecution for official acts taken while in the White House. The immunity decision affects special counsel Jack Smith's case against Trump, who pleaded not guilty to four counts stemming from an alleged scheme to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election.\n\nBut the court also rejected a challenge by anti-abortion doctors seeking to make a widely used abortion pill harder to obtain, cleared the way for Idaho physicians to perform emergency abortions in certain circumstances and upheld a federal law prohibiting alleged domestic abusers from having guns.\n\nDemocrats' criticism of the Supreme Court ramped up after the conservative majority unwound the constitutional right to abortion two years ago, an outcome made possible by Trump's three appointments to the Supreme Court. His final pick, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, took her seat on the high court days before the 2020 election following the death of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in September 2020.\n\nBut Trump's own ascension to the White House in 2016 was fueled in part by voters who cared about Supreme Court appointments, an issue that took on added significance following the unexpected death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia that February. Of voters who said Supreme Court nominations were the most important factor when considering who to support in the 2016 race, 56% cast ballots for Trump, according to exit polls. Additionally, 26% of Trump voters said appointments were the most important factor for them.\n\nMuch as the vacancy created by Scalia's death drove conservative voters to back Trump in 2016, progressives are hoping that the prospect of open seats in the next four years drives voters to support Mr. Biden in November.\n\n\"It's no secret that progressives are far behind\" in educating voters about the court, Stasha Rhodes, United for Democracy's campaign director, said. \"But we see an opportunity over the coming months to turn this around.\"\n\nThree of the justices, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Sonia Sotomayor, are in their 70s, and Chief Justice John Roberts is 69. If Trump wins, Thomas, who is the longest serving of the current justices, and Alito could step down, allowing the Republican president to appoint successors who would be younger and therefore poised to serve for decades. Trump's three appointees, Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Barrett, are all in their 50s. It's highly unlikely either Thomas or Alito will retire if Mr. Biden is reelected in November.\n\nMr. Biden himself has warned that the next president could nominate two justices to the Supreme Court, and former President Barack Obama said during a joint fundraiser with the president last month that the current landscape is a byproduct of the 2016 election.\n\n\"We have learned our lesson because these elections matter in very concrete ways,\" Obama said. \"And we're seeing how much it matters when it comes to the Supreme Court.\"\n\nLiberal commentators have suggested Sotomayor should retire this year, with Mr. Biden still in the White House and Democrats in control of the Senate. But the idea has not gained traction with Senate Democrats.\n\nStill, Harvey indicated the coalition's efforts are aimed not only at helping Democrats hold onto the White House, but also retaining control of the Senate and flipping the House, which is now controlled by Republicans. Total control by Democrats could clear the way for Congress to enact court-reform legislation, including a bill imposing term limits on current and future justices, she said.\n\nUnder that plan, called the Supreme Court Term Act, a president would name a justice every two years, and current members would be required to assume senior status, a form of semi-retirement, in order of length of tenure as new justices are appointed. If passed by a Democrat-led Congress and signed into law by a Democratic president, the legislation would require Thomas, appointed in 1991, to step down first, followed by Roberts, tapped in 2005.\n\nUnder that scenario, control of the court would flip from a 6-3 conservative majority to 5-4 liberal majority in a matter of years.\n\n\"We want to make sure that the American people understand the power that they and their elected representatives have to check an extreme movement in the court. The Constitution of the United States provides Congress the power to fix this problem, said Skye Perryman, senior adviser to Demand Justice, a liberal judicial advocacy group. \"Sometimes that gets lost and the court seems like an untouchable entity and the die is cast and there's nothing that the American people can do, but our Constitution provides the tools for the American people to make their voices heard and to lawmakers to enact reforms.\"\n\nDemand Justice, which is one of the most vocal groups advocating for reforming the Supreme Court, plans to spend $10 million this year on efforts targeting the high court. As part of its offensive, it will be launching a $2 million campaign focused on moms that aims to educate them about the court and the ramifications of its rulings for women and families.\n\n\"This is a critical moment where people are understanding and paying attention to what is happening in the courts,\" Perryman said.\n\nSeparately, Democrats on Capitol Hill have been mounting attacks on the Supreme Court and its conservative members, specifically Thomas and Alito, over their ties to wealthy Republican benefactors.\n\nDemocratic Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse and Ron Wyden urged Attorney General Merrick Garland last week to appoint a special counsel to investigate Thomas, who has faced scrutiny over travel he accepted from GOP megadonor Harlan Crow.\n\nAnd on Wednesday, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York introduced articles of impeachment against Thomas and Alito, escalating Democrats' disapproval of the high court and its conservative members.\n\nIt's highly unlikely the GOP-led House will act on the articles, and Republican lawmakers have denounced Democrats' actions as an attempt to undermine the court's legitimacy in response to decisions on politically charged issues with which they disagree.",

This new initiative was made possible by resources from President Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act.\u00a0The IRS in 2023 launched a new initiative to pursue high-income, high-wealth individuals who have failed to pay recognized tax debt, with dozens of senior employees assigned to these cases. This campaign is concentrated among taxpayers with more than $1 million in income and more than $250,000 in recognized tax debt.\u201cPresident Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act is increasing tax fairness and ensuring that all wealthy taxpayers pay the taxes they owe, just like working families do,\u201d said U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. \u201cA new initiative to collect overdue taxes from a small group of wealthy taxpayers is already a major success, yielding more than $1 billion in revenue so far.\u201dIn an initial success, the IRS announced last year that it had collected $38 million from more than 175 high-income, high-wealth individuals. The IRS then expanded this effort last fall to 1,600 additional high-income, high-wealth individuals. The IRS has assigned more than 1,500 of these 1,600 cases to senior employees, with more than $1 billion collected to date.Prior to President Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act, more than a decade of budget cuts prevented the IRS from keeping pace with increasing complexity and ensuring that wealthy taxpayers, large corporations, and complex partnerships pay taxes owed under current law. The effort to pursue high-income, high-wealth individuals who have failed to pay past-due tax debt is one of several initiatives the IRS has launched to improve tax fairness and reduce the deficit. In the past two years, the IRS has launched:\u00a0A new initiative to crack down on abuse of corporate jets for personal travel.\u00a0A campaign to collect taxes owed by 125,000 high-income, high-wealth earners who have not filed taxes in years.\u00a0Audits of 76 of the largest partnerships with average assets of $10 billion that represent a cross section of industries including hedge funds, real estate investment partnerships, publicly traded partnerships, and large law firms.Audits of the 60 largest corporate taxpayers, with average assets of $24 billion.\u202f\u00a0And a new regulatory initiative to close a major tax loophole exploited by large, complex partnerships that could raise more than $50 billion in revenue over 10 years.\u00a0In addition to enhancing tax fairness, these initiatives will narrow the gap between taxes owed and taxes paid, reducing the deficit.\u00a0New Treasury and IRS analysis shows these investments in high-end enforcement, technology, and data resulting in $851 billion in additional revenue over the next decade if the investments in the Inflation Reduction Act are continued as President Biden has proposed.\u00a0These enforcement initiatives are consistent with Secretary Yellen\u2019s commitment to not increase audit rates relative to current levels for Americans making less than $400,000 a year.\u00a0###",

        "text": "UH \u2013 TSU Survey: Trump Leads Biden by Nine Points Among Texas Voters\nA new survey of likely Texas voters found former President Donald Trump leading President Joe Biden by nine points in the state, 49% to 40%, with four months to go until the November election.\n\nThe survey, conducted by the Hobby School of Public Affairs at the University of Houston and the Executive Master of Public Administration program in the Barbara Jordan \u2013 Mickey Leland School of Public Affairs at Texas Southern University, found attitudes unchanged since January, when a Hobby School survey also found Trump leading Biden, 49% to 40%.\n\nTrump drew support in the latest survey from a broad spectrum of Texans, including a slight lead among Latino voters, who support Trump over Biden 45% to 41%. The survey found 5% of likely voters support independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr., while 2% support Green Party candidate Jill Stein; 4% are undecided.\n\nThe U.S. Senate race between incumbent Republican Ted Cruz and Democrat U.S. Rep. Colin Allred has tightened over the past five months, with Cruz now holding a three-point lead, 47% to 44%. Cruz led by nine points last winter.\n\nThe survey was conducted between June 20 and July 1 \u2013 after Trump\u2019s conviction on 34 felony counts by a Manhattan jury, while about one-third of responses were collected following the June 27 debate between Trump and Biden.\n\n\u201cEven after Trump\u2019s conviction, and all of the concerns over Biden\u2019s age, his poor debate performance and Kennedy\u2019s high-profile entrance into the race, voters haven\u2019t changed their minds about the candidates,\u201d said Ren\u00e9e Cross, researcher and senior executive director of the Hobby School. \u201cVoters know these candidates, and little seems likely to sway their opinions.\u201d\n\nThat held true even though 51% of likely voters said they believe Trump is guilty of the crimes for which he was convicted, Cross said. Another 35% said they believe the former president is not guilty, while 14% said they are unsure.\n\nIn fact, 92% of Trump voters and 94% of Biden voters said they are certain they won\u2019t change their mind before the Nov. 5 election. Partisan identity remains strong, with 92% of Republicans saying they will vote for Trump and 86% of Democrats supporting Biden. Trump holds a substantial lead over Biden among Independents, with 42% of the Independent vote, compared to 18% for Biden. An additional 14% of Independents say they will vote for Kennedy, and 16% are undecided.\n\n\u201cOverall, we found Trump leading among most demographic groups in Texas, with the strongest support among men, white voters and older voters,\u201d said Mark P. Jones, political science fellow at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy and senior research fellow at the Hobby School. \u201cThe only exceptions were Black voters, who supported Biden by a margin of 57 points (73% to 16%), and Millennial voters, who gave Biden a smaller edge, 46% to 40% for Trump.\u201d\n\nWhite voters supported Trump by more than 20 points, 56% to 35%. Latino voters split more narrowly, with 45% supporting Trump and 41% supporting Biden.\n\nFour out of 10 Trump voters identified immigration and border security as the top issue in the race, while just 4% of Biden voters agreed. Among Biden voters, 27% said the future of U.S. democracy is the top issue; 4% of Trump voters said the same. Overall, Jones said, voters listed immigration and border security (23%), the economy (15%), inflation (15%) and the future of U.S. democracy (13%) as the issue that is most important to their presidential vote decision.\n\nWhile the Trump-Biden matchup has remained unchanged for months, there has been a notable shift in the race for U.S. Senate, with Allred inching closer to Cruz, running for his third term in the Senate.\n\n\u201cEarlier in the year, especially before Allred secured the Democratic nomination in the March primary, he was more of an unknown quantity,\u201d said Michael O. Adams, director of the Executive Master of Public Administration graduate program at TSU. \u201cAs a congressman from Dallas, he wasn\u2019t well-known in the rest of the state, but as a result of winning the primary and months of campaigning and advertising, his name ID has increased, and support has nudged up by five points.\u201d\n\nLibertarian Ted Brown had 3% of the vote in that race, while 6% are undecided.\n\nAmong other findings:\n\n50% of likely voters said they have a favorable opinion of Trump, slightly more than the 49% with an unfavorable opinion of the former president.\n\n44% of likely voters have a favorable opinion of Biden, notably less than the 55% who have an unfavorable opinion of the president.\n\n42% of likely voters have a favorable opinion of Vice President Kamala Harris, notably less than the 56% who have an unfavorable opinion of her.\n\n49% of likely voters said they have a favorable impression of Cruz, while 48% ranked him unfavorably. 46% had a favorable impression of Allred, while 31% had an unfavorable impression. Another 23% said they did not know enough about Allred to form an impression.\n\nRepublican incumbent Christi Craddick is leading her challengers in the race for Texas Railroad Commission, with 41% of the vote. Democrat Katherine Culbert has 35%, while Libertarian Hawk Dunlap and Green Party candidate Eddie Espinoza are tied at 3% each. 18% are undecided.\n\nThe full report is available on the Hobby School website. The survey was conducted between June 20 and July 1 and was conducted in English and Spanish, with 2,257 YouGov respondents 18 years of age and older. The margin of error is +/-2.1 for the overall survey population and +/- 2.5 for the sub-population of 1,484 likely voters. Future reports will look at school choice/vouchers, housing, immigration and climate challenges.",

        "text": "Are convention delegates bound to their presidential candidate?\nThis question would not even be asked were it not for President Biden\u2019s weak performance in his recent debate with Donald Trump\u2014a performance that has called into doubt his ability run and to govern. The question arises against the backdrop of recent American history where delegates have been extras in the convention television show produced for prime time. They cheer on cue, wear colorful patriotic regalia, and offer glowing reviews of their standard-bearers to reporters desperate for a little bit of hard news. Because the victor at most modern conventions has been a foregone conclusion, the notion of delegates as the final decision-makers in a long nomination process has been lost\u2014but, under certain circumstances, perhaps this one, they may still have the final word.\n\nHere\u2019s a bit of history.\n\nBetween 1831 and 1972, presidential candidates were nominated in conventions composed of elected officials and party leaders. Primaries were an invention of the Progressive Era, but presidential primaries were few and far between\u2014averaging, between 1932 and 1968, about 16 a year and, moreover, most of those primaries were non-binding, meaning they were \u201cbeauty contests\u201d only and had little to do with the preferences of convention delegates.1 In other words, they were irrelevant. For example, in 1952, Tennessee Senator Estes Kefauver won 12 out of the 15 presidential primaries held that year, but his victories did not add up to delegates and he lost the nomination to Adlai Stevenson on the third ballot.\n\nAnd then came the tumultuous 1968 convention which took place in the midst of protests against the war in Vietnam. Of the nine primaries that even listed the presidential candidates on the ballot, only three were in states where the primary results were binding when it came to delegate selection.2 Anti-war activists felt locked out of the party and were given, as a sort of consolation prize, a reform commission.\n\nThe reform movement in the Democratic Party that followed did two things, which were to radically change the nomination system\u2014it required delegates to \u201cfairly reflect\u201d the presidential preferences of the voters that chose them\u2014and it began the movement away from state conventions which selected delegates and toward primaries. Today, in both political parties, most states have a presidential primary, and delegates are selected to reflect the results.3\n\nImplicit in the move to binding primaries (which happened in both parties) was the assumption that delegates would not be free agents\u2014they would vote according to the results of the primary in their district or in their state. In other words, they would be \u201cbound\u201d to their candidate. In the modern era, this assumption has only come under serious attack twice\u2014once in the in Democratic Party and once in the Republican Party.\n\nIn 1980, the Democratic President Jimmy Carter faced a very difficult re-election. He had presided over record high inflation and unemployment\u2014a situation economists had thought impossible until then. The Iranian hostage crisis and the military\u2019s failed attempt to rescue them was a major humiliation and he was running far behind the Republican nominee Ronald Reagan. His political weakness led Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy to run against him in the primaries. And even though Carter racked up a substantial delegate lead early on, Kennedy began to win some later primaries and decided to take the fight all the way to the convention.\n\nThat\u2019s where Kennedy came up against what came to be known as \u201cthe robot rule\u201d\u2014Rule 11(H). It said that all delegates to the convention were bound \u201cto vote for the presidential candidate whom they were elected to support for at least the first convention ballot, unless released in writing by the presidential candidate.\u201d4 Furthermore the rule contained an enforcement mechanism\u2014delegates who tried to vote for someone other than the person they were elected to represent \u201cmay be replaced with an alternate of the same presidential preference by the presidential candidate\u2026\u201d5 To take the nomination away from President Carter, Kennedy had to convince enough delegates to change this rule. The battle was fought over the summer of 1980. In the end, very few Carter delegates defected and voted against the rule, allowing Carter to clinch the nomination.\n\nIn 2016, the Republican Convention went through their own version of the \u201crobot rule\u201d fight. Donald Trump had won the most delegates by running up pluralities in a fractured field of candidates. As the convention opened, it became clear that many important Republicans had serious doubts about Trump and were skipping the convention. Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, an anti-Trump Republican, told people he wouldn\u2019t be there because he had to \u201cmow his lawn.\u201d6\n\nAs in 1980, those who showed up to attempt to deny Trump the nomination centered their strategy around a rule. This one (Rule 16) read \u201cIf any delegate\u2026demonstrates support under Rule 40 for any person other than the candidate to whom he or she is bound, such support shall not be recognized.\u201d7 What this meant in practice was the secretary of the convention could ignore the votes of the actual delegates on the floor and simply record the delegate preferences as they had emerged in the primaries\u2014Robot Redux\u2014if you will. Republican delegate Kendal Unruh of Colorado, one of the leaders of the Stop Trump movement, proposed that the rule be amended to include a conscience clause that would allow delegates to vote against Trump on the first ballot. Other activists formed a group called \u201cDelegates Unbound,\u201d and Curly Haugland, a national committeeman from North Dakota, argued in a book called \u201cUnbound: The Conscience of a Republican Delegate,\u201d that delegates should be free agents.8 Ultimately, the attempt to change the rule failed and Trump\u2019s nomination moved ahead to victory.\n\nIn the eight years since the 2016 convention, Trump\u2019s control over the Republican Party has solidified, and a challenge, including a fight over the role of the delegate, is unlikely. Not so for the Democrats, however. Following their contentious 1980 convention, the robot rule was quietly buried and replaced with the following\u2014Rule 13 (J):\n\n\u201cDelegates elected to the national convention pledged to a presidential candidate shall in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them.\u201d [Italics are mine.]\n\nThere is no definition, nor is there any history about what constitutes \u201cin all good conscience.\u201d Few, if any, delegates to recent conventions have ever sought to test it. But if worries about President Biden\u2019s ability to run and to serve continue to grow, along with fears of handing the presidency over to Donald Trump, some delegates may find themselves tempted to vote for someone else. It would not be surprising if this rule and the decades-long debate over the role of the delegate becomes relevant again.",

        "text": "As Kamala Harris rises, Gavin Newsom\u2019s presidential prospects fall \u2014 at least in the short term\nVice President Kamala Harris rallied with Gov. Gavin Newsroom in 2021 against the effort to recall him, which he easily defeated.\n\nAs rising stars in the California Democratic Party, Kamala Harris and Gavin Newsom dodged a potentially bruising campaign battle in 2015 when she chose to run for U.S. Senate and he announced his candidacy for governor.\n\nThis week, Newsom said he would avoid an even bigger potential head-to-head fight with Harris over the White House.\n\nThe California governor repeated that he would not run against Harris, standing by a comment he made last year that has new relevance after President Biden\u2019s performance in the June presidential debate left many in the party calling for him to leave the race.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough Biden has vowed to continue his bid for reelection, a decision Newsom has steadfastly supported, Harris and the California governor have been widely mentioned as potential replacements for the Democratic presidential nomination. As vice president, Harris appears to be the front-runner, and has the most legitimate claim given that she\u2019s already on the 2024 ticket.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Newsom said when asked whether he would still decline to run against Harris. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nIf it holds, his decision could save the party and its donors from having to choose between California\u2019s two most prominent politicians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeclining to challenge Harris if Biden drops out places Newsom on a longer track to the White House \u2014 putting any potential presidential ambitions on hold for him until 2028 at the soonest. Harris, on the other hand, could find herself leading a last-minute rescue mission to salvage the Democratic Party\u2019s campaign against former President Trump and to make her own presidential dreams come true.\n\nFor Newsom, averting the matchup is also a tacit acknowledgment of the political reality: Trying to skip over the vice president, and potentially the first Black female president, wouldn\u2019t bode well for the governor, or for most other Democrats.\n\nHis own chances of becoming the Democratic nominee could also be better in four years.\n\n\u201cThis is not the time to make that power move, and I think Gavin Newsom understands that,\u201d said Aimee Allison, founder and president of She the People.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAllison\u2019s group, which pushes for more women of color in elected office, advocated for Biden to select Harris as his running mate in 2020 and rallied voters to support the cause.\n\nBack then, many expected Biden to be a one-term president. In tapping Harris, he helped revive her political career after her own presidential campaign flopped, and raised the possibility that Biden might pass the baton to her before this year\u2019s primaries.\n\nThough Allison commended Newsom for his recent ad campaigns in conservative states to call out their efforts to rescind reproductive rights, and for his political attacks on Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, she said he has more work to do to introduce himself to the country.\n\n\u201cMy sense was, and still is, that a generational transition right now with Kamala Harris heading it is logical, and it\u2019s also the closest thing the Democrats have to winning strategy this late in the cycle,\u201d Allison said.\n\nPolls have shown Harris with a lead over other potential Democratic candidates. She also appears to be performing about the same as Biden has against Trump in surveys. The longer Biden holds out, the shorter the window and the harder it will be for someone else to launch a campaign if he steps down.\n\nAt a news conference Thursday, Biden praised Harris as he vowed again to stay in the race.\n\n\u201cShe is qualified to be president \u2014 that\u2019s why I picked her,\u201d he said of selecting her in 2020 as his running mate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNewsom first said he wouldn\u2019t run against Harris in a September interview with Chuck Todd on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d Biden had already launched his reelection campaign, but rumblings persisted about whether the president should run again. The governor made it clear that he supported Biden, and said that Harris was naturally lined up to run if the president were to step out of the race.\n\nDuring a tour of swing states earlier this week to campaign for the Democratic ticket, Newsom said that as someone who has known Harris since before either of them got into politics, he believes Harris could beat Trump.\n\n\u201cI have no doubt about that,\u201d he told reporters in New Hampshire. \u201cIf it comes to that. But I don\u2019t expect it\u2019s going to come to that.\u201d\n\nCalifornia Newsom praises Biden, shoots down post-debate questions about replacing him California Gov. Newsom, in Atlanta to rally support for President Biden after his debate with Donald Trump, found himself batting away speculation about his own political ambitions.\n\nHarris, who was born in Oakland, spent 13 years as a prosecutor in Alameda County and San Francisco before she ran for San Francisco district attorney in 2003 and won. She went on to serve as California attorney general from 2011 to 2017, then joined the U.S. Senate.\n\nAs her contemporary, Newsom grew up in San Francisco, where he got his start as a parking commissioner in 1996. A businessman with a chain of wineries, hotels and retail shops, he was soon serving on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, and was elected mayor in 2003. He served two terms as California\u2019s lieutenant governor and won the 2018 governor\u2019s race.\n\nThe governor largely avoided directly answering questions about whether he would run to replace Biden in the aftermath of the late June debate in Atlanta, which he attended as a surrogate for the president. Biden\u2019s performance, in which he struggled to answer questions and occasionally trailed off, left Newsom facing a flurry of questions about his own ambitions as panic set in among Democrats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNewsom remained a soldier for the campaign, reiterating that he supported Biden as the party\u2019s nominee. Seeking to shore up support for the president, he swatted down concerns about Biden\u2019s mental capacity and attested to the president\u2019s fitness based on their personal interactions.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve had 100 media outlets asking the same question, and I think that I\u2019ve amply answered my support for the president, and the support I saw on the ground was demonstrable,\u201d Newsom in a news conference at Sacramento McClellan Airport on Wednesday upon his return from the campaign trip.\n\nNewsom also reaffirmed his stance that he would not run against Harris in a presidential campaign. Days earlier, another top Democrat, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, had also said she wouldn\u2019t consider running if Biden were to step down.\n\nForgoing a Hail Mary bid to try to become the party\u2019s nominee at the August convention is smart politically for Newsom, said Thad Kousser, a professor of political science at UC San Diego.\n\nNewsom can score points for unwaveringly supporting the Democratic ticket whether Biden or Harris is on top. He can continue to use the opportunity to act as a surrogate for the ticket, attending debates and traveling the country in a way that introduces him to more voters across the nation without stepping on Biden\u2019s or Harris\u2019 toes. Then he can wait for the dust to settle to determine his future presidential prospects.\n\n\u201cHe took a reality and made it a virtue,\u201d Kousser said. \u201cCertainly, he gave up a short-term possibility of coming into this role and leading the Democrats to victory in 2024. He set himself up quite well for 2028 and beyond.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Harris or Biden wins in November, Harris would be a front-runner again in the 2028 presidential contest, which would leave Newsom in a tough position if he wants to run then. A Democratic loss in November could bring Harris\u2019 presidential hopes down with the campaign and open the door for Newsom, or someone else, to grab the nomination in four years.\n\nSuch a loss would mean Newsom\u2019s last two years in the governor\u2019s office would be spent in a high-profile battle with an antagonistic Trump White House, which could set the stage for a 2028 campaign in which his top California competition is already neutralized.\n\n\u201cIf Joe Biden, or another Democrat loses, I think Gavin Newsom is the presumptive leader of the opposition against Donald Trump,\u201d Kousser said, \u201cbecause he has been the most forceful critic of the direction that Donald Trump wants to take America.\u201d\n\nTimes staff writer Seema Mehta contributed to this report.",

        "text": "George Clooney asks Biden to leave US presidential race: Why do his views matter?\nAmerican actor-director George Clooney on Wednesday (July 10) called for Joe Biden to leave the US presidential race, weeks after organising a major fundraiser and endorsing him for another presidential term.\n\nIn an opinion article for The New York Times, titled \u2018I Love Joe Biden. But We Need a New Nominee,\u2019 Clooney argued that Biden needed to step aside to ensure his party defeats Republican candidate Donald Trump. \u201cJoe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020. We need him to do it again in 2024,\u201d he wrote.\n\nClooney joins a growing list of Democratic Party members and supporters who have asked the President to end his candidacy due to age- and health-related reasons. These appeals grew louder after Biden\u2019s disastrous performance in a TV debate with Trump last month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat did Clooney say in his essay about Joe Biden?\n\nClooney prefaced the article with his friendship with the President and his own support for the Democratic Party over the years. \u201c\u2026I believe in him (Biden)\u2026 In the last four years, he\u2019s won many of the battles he\u2019s faced. But the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI have led some of the biggest fund-raisers in my party\u2019s history. Barack Obama in 2012. Hillary Clinton in 2016. Joe Biden in 2020. Last month I co-hosted the single largest fund-raiser supporting any Democratic candidate ever, for President Biden\u2019s re-election. I say all of this only to express how much I believe in this process and how profound I think this moment is.\u201d\n\nOn June 14, George Clooney headlined a glitzy fundraiser where Hollywood legends like Barbara Streisand rubbed shoulders with former President Barack Obama. The party reported that they raised at least $28 million.\n\nClooney highlighted the apparent signs of age and mental infirmity that have been noted in the President\u2019s public appearances. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe \u201cbig F-ing deal\u201d Biden of 2010. He wasn\u2019t even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe further criticised the Democratic Party for not asking Biden to drop out, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we\u2019ve opted to ignore every warning sign.\u201d\n\nWhy does Clooney\u2019s opinion matter?\n\nGeorge Clooney is an Academy Award-winning actor, producer and director, often seen as an icon of American movies. Apart from garnering widespread professional acclaim and success over the years, he has received appreciation for his humanitarian efforts in Sudan, Haiti, Syria and Lebanon. His criticism of Biden\u2019s candidacy matters given his widespread name recognition and his position as a longtime supporter of the Democrats.\n\nClooney has endorsed every presidential candidate since 2008 and actively contributed to their fundraising efforts. His support of Barack Obama helped the Democrats raise at least $15 million, a sum also collected during Hilary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign in 2016.\n\nWhat difference could Clooney\u2019s essay make, if at all?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe op-ed is expected to embolden more Democrats and party supporters to demand Biden\u2019s replacement with another Democrat in the race.\n\nOn Wednesday, former House Speaker and senior Democrat Nancy Pelosi said \u201cIt\u2019s up to the president to decide\u201d whether to continue running. Senator Peter Welch of Vermont became the first senator to ask Biden to bow out of the race. This makes him the 10th elected Democrat to do so.\n\nThe situation signifies growing discontent and confusion within the party, with Biden defiantly refusing to quit. In August, the party will officially announce its candidate at the Democratic National Convention for the November polls. Prolonged infighting over the candidate would likely harm the party\u2019s electoral prospects, so time is of the essence.\n\nOther liberal voices in Hollywood could also speak out. Apart from affecting larger perceptions of Biden and the Democrats, it could negatively impact fundraising efforts with other high-profile donors refusing further support.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the other hand, seasoned voters would continue to be guided by their existing political leaning on important electoral issues such as immigration and the economy.",

        "text": "10 facts about Republicans in the U.S.\nDelegates from Ohio stand for the Pledge of Allegiance at the opening of the Republican National Convention on July 15, 2024, in Milwaukee. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nAs Republicans prepare to open their national convention in Milwaukee and renominate Donald Trump for president, here are some key facts about the roughly half of registered voters who identify with or lean toward the party, according to Pew Research Center data.\n\nHow we did this This Pew Research Center analysis focuses on Republicans\u2019 demographic characteristics and key political attitudes ahead of the 2024 Republican National Convention. The public opinion data in this analysis comes from several recent Pew Research Center surveys. Links to these surveys, including details about their methodologies, are available in the text.\n\nRepublican voters are overwhelmingly White, though less so than in the past. About eight-in-ten Republican voters (79%) are non-Hispanic White, down from 93% nearly two decades ago. Still, Hispanic, Black and Asian voters together make up a much smaller share of Republican voters than Democratic voters (15% vs. 39%).\n\nAbout two-thirds of Republican voters (64%) do not have a four-year college degree \u2013 modestly higher than the share among all U.S. voters (60%).\n\nOverall, about half of Republican voters (51%) are White adults without a college degree, making them the single largest bloc within the party when looking at race, ethnicity and education together. By comparison, White adults without a college degree account for 38% of U.S. voters overall.\n\nRepublican voters are older than voters overall. About two-thirds of Republican voters (65%) are ages 50 and older, compared with 59% among all voters.\n\nJust 8% of Republican voters are under 30. Among Democratic voters, those under 30 account for twice that share (16%).\n\nRelated: 10 facts about Democrats in the U.S.\n\nAround eight-in-ten Republican voters (81%) identify with a Christian denomination, compared with 67% of all registered voters. The largest religious group among Republicans is White evangelical Protestants, who make up 30% of GOP registered voters. White evangelicals make up a far smaller share of U.S. voters overall (17%).\n\nJust 15% of Republican voters are religiously unaffiliated, compared with about a quarter of all voters (26%).\n\nThe vast majority of Republican voters plan to vote for Donald Trump. More than eight-in-ten GOP voters (84%) say they would vote for Trump if the election were held today, while 13% favor Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Just 3% would support Joe Biden.\n\nIn the last two presidential elections, about nine-in-ten Republican voters cast their ballot for Trump (92% in 2020 and 89% in 2016). Read more about views of Trump ahead of the 2024 election in our latest report.\n\nLarge majorities of Republican voters are confident that Trump can make good decisions on key policies, but many have reservations about his personal conduct. At least eight-in-ten Republican voters say they are very or somewhat confident that Trump can make good decisions about economic policy (91%), immigration policy (89%), foreign policy (86%) and abortion policy (80%).\n\nHowever, only about a quarter (26%) like the way he conducts himself personally, while 52% have mixed feelings and 21% don\u2019t like his conduct.\n\nMost Republicans say the stakes of the 2024 presidential election are high. About three-quarters of Republican voters (73%) say it really matters who wins. Just 5% say it doesn\u2019t really matter who wins.\n\nRepublicans overwhelmingly see illegal immigration as one of the top problems facing the country. Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents overall (not just GOP registered voters), 78% say illegal immigration is a very big problem in the country today, our May 2024 survey found. This is far higher than the share of all U.S. adults who say the same (51%).\n\nAbout six-in-ten Republicans (61%) say undocumented immigrants currently living in the United States should not be allowed to stay legally, according to an April 2024 survey. The share of Republicans who say this has increased by 19 percentage points since 2020.\n\nRepublicans are very negative about the state of the U.S. economy. In particular, Republicans are far more concerned than Democrats about inflation. Eight-in-ten Republicans say inflation is a very big problem in the country today, according to the May 2024 survey. By comparison, 46% of Democrats say this.\n\nThe public\u2019s views of the economy are highly partisan, and throughout Biden\u2019s presidency, Republicans have been more negative about the state of the U.S. economy than Democrats. Just 10% of Republicans rated economic conditions excellent or good. During Trump\u2019s administration, Democrats were more negative than Republicans about the economy.\n\nRepublicans are more divided over abortion than Democrats are. About six-in-ten Republicans (57%) say abortion should be illegal in all or most cases, while 41% say it should be legal in all or most cases, according to the April 2024 survey. Among Democrats, 85% say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, and just 14% say it should be illegal in all or most cases.\n\nRepublican hostility toward Democrats has increased significantly in recent decades. Over the past several decades, there has been a sizable increase in the shares of both Republicans and Democrats who view the opposing party very unfavorably. Today, 53% of Republicans have a very unfavorable opinion of the Democratic Party, up from 21% three decades ago.\n\nRepublicans also nearly unanimously dislike Biden. More than nine-in-ten (93%) say they have an unfavorable opinion of the president, according to the May 2024 survey. Meanwhile, almost a quarter of Republicans (22%) have unfavorable opinions of both Biden and Trump.",

This shocking act of political violence will inevitably have an effect on the campaign. US Secret Service agents shot dead the suspect at the scene. And law enforcement sources told the BBC's US partner CBS News that they are treating the attack as an assassination attempt. The picture - of a bleeding Mr Trump, fist in the air, being escorted away- was quickly posted on social media by his son Eric Trump with the caption: \u201cThis is the fighter America needs.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden appeared on TV shortly after the shooting and said there was no place in America for political violence like this. He expressed concern for his Republican opponent and said he hoped to speak with him later tonight. Mr Biden\u2019s election campaign paused all political statements and is working to take down its television ads as quickly as possible, clearly believing that it would be inappropriate to attack Donald Trump at this time and instead concentrating on condemning what\u2019s happened. Politicians from across the political spectrum \u2013 people who agree on very little else \u2013 are coming together to say violence has no place in a democracy. Former Presidents Barack Obama, George W Bush and Bill Clinton, plus the Carter Center speaking on behalf of Jimmy Carter, were all quick to denounce the violence and said how relieved they were that Trump was not seriously hurt.\n\nWatch now on iPlayer Trump Assassination Attempt: What Happened?",

        "text": "Learn more at Marianne2024.com\nDear Friends,\n\nIn 2016, there were two candidates telling people their pain was legitimate and their rage was valid \u2013 that the system indeed had been rigged against them. They were Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump.\n\nOnly one of them, however, wanted to do something about it. The other mainly sought to harness all that anger for his own political purposes.\n\nAnd here we are.\n\nThe rage that people were feeling then is still felt today. Has the system improved economically in the last two years? In some ways, yes. But in fundamental ways, no. It\u2019s now baked into the cake that our corrupted political system is at the service of the few at the expense of the many. And it will not disrupt itself.\n\nOne in four Americans still live with medical debt. A third of America\u2019s workforce work for less than $15 an hour; half can\u2019t afford a one bedroom apartment. Half our seniors live on less than $25,000 a year. The United States has the highest poverty rate of any advanced democracy.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the top 20 per cent of American earners, the economy works well. And for that we can be grateful. But that 20 per cent live on an island that is surrounded by a sea of economic despair. Within that sea, a myriad of personal and societal dysfunctions breed easily \u2013 from chronic anxiety and addiction to ideological capture by genuinely psychotic, even fascist elements of our society.\n\nWe must respond to this situation, for it represents an unsustainable disquiet.\n\nFranklin Roosevelt said we wouldn\u2019t have to worry about a fascist takeover in America so long as democracy delivered on its promises. Yes, there is a genuine fascist threat in America today. But we can\u2019t just fight the disease; we must build up our societal immune system, as well. That means we must build up our people.\n\nWe must provide a massive infusion of economic hope and opportunity to the over 70 per cent of Americans who say they feel no economic hope, who simply do what they can to survive what they know is an inherently unjust economic system. Their dreams, and the dreams of their children, are limited. They are depressed and angry about it, and if those feelings are not assuaged \u2013 if their needs are not met \u2013 then America will be in even bigger trouble than we are now.\n\nThat is why I am running for President. I have had a forty year career working up close and personal with people whose lives are in trouble, and too many are in trouble now.\n\nOur government \u201cof the people, by the people, and for the people\u201d has become a government \u201cof the corporations, by the corporations, and for the corporations.\u201d Our public policies regularly do more to serve the goal of short-term profit maximization for corporate and billionaire donors, than to serve the goal of safety, health and well-being of the American people.\n\nThe humanitarian values at the core of our Declaration of Independence have been replaced by a soulless economics as the governing principle of our civilization. The tentacles of hyper-capitalism, devoid of any ethical or moral consideration, now reach greedily into every corner of our society. A Second Gilded Age is upon us, income disparity as great as at any time in our history, and everything from climate catastrophe to AI catastrophe to nuclear catastrophe now loom as genuine threats to our civilization.\n\nIt is time to turn around.\n\nIn the words of President John F. Kennedy, \u201cThose who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable.\u201d In the years ahead of us, America is going to change. It is up to us to make the change a conscious, wise and responsible one. As President, I will make sure we do.\n\nA corporate aristocracy \u2013 from insurance and pharmaceutical companies to Big Ag to Big Food to chemical companies to gun manufacturers to Big Oil to Big Tech to defense contractors \u2013 now tyrannize this country, and the days of their overreach and entitlement must end. No one thing is going to make that happen, but a president who is willing to use the power of the executive branch to stand up to what Roosevelt called the \u201ceconomic royalists\u201d is a good solid beginning. And I will be that.\n\nAs Americans, we need a season of repair, a new beginning, a renewed faith in what\u2019s possible. Our political imaginations can flourish once more, if we allow the better angels of our nature to emerge among us. I dedicate this campaign to the people, to the spirit in our hearts, and to the possibility of fundamental change.\n\nWith your help, we can spread this message far and wide and set America on the path of a new beginning.",

Here\u2019s what happens now\n\ntoggle caption Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images\n\nFor more on Biden's decision and the now open 2024 race, head to the NPR Network's live updates page.\n\nPresident Biden announced he is stepping aside and has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to replace him at the top of the ticket, putting an end to weeks of Democratic alarm following his disastrous debate performance against former President Donald Trump last month.\n\nHarris said in a statement that she plans to earn and win the Democratic party\u2019s nomination, with just one month remaining before the party convention in Chicago.\n\nAll of this sets off a series of events not seen in more than 50 years. If another Democrat steps up to challenge Harris, the party could be headed for an open convention, which could go to multiple rounds of voting.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMuch depends on whether Democrats \u2013 and more importantly, the 4,700 or so convention delegates \u2013 coalesce behind a single candidate before they convene on August 19.\n\nWhat happens if there's a competitor for Harris\n\nIf there are serious competitors for Harris, the convention would be preceded by something resembling a highly accelerated primary campaign where the voters being wooed are the delegates. The delegate voting process is spelled out in Democratic party rules.\n\n\u201cThink of it as a redo of the primary system in a very, very, very compressed period of time,\u201d said Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a Democratic National Committee member and a delegate herself. She spoke to a group of delegates about the potential process on Friday.\n\nShe suggested the candidates would name their intended running mates.\n\nBut Kamarck told delegates that she was skeptical there would be a contest, because of the tight timelines. \u201cThe problem is we are really up against the clock. This is a month,\u201d she told delegates on a Zoom on Friday.\n\nUnder DNC rules, requests to nominate a candidate must be presented in writing and include written approval from the proposed nominee \u2013 as well as a petition with signatures from at least 300 convention delegates. Harris has already racked up enough endorsements that this will be easy for her to pull together. But for other candidates, lining up that support could be more of a challenge.\n\ntoggle caption Paul Sancya/AP\n\n\u201cYou might not really know where it was going until we actually got to the convention and the delegates actually got there,\u201d said Kamarck.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAt the convention, each candidate would be allowed 20 minutes of supporting speeches from the people nominating and seconding them \u2013 and then there would be a roll call vote by states, in alphabetical order.\n\nThe delegates voting would include those previously pledged to Biden as well as about 700 so-called \u2018superdelegates\u2019, which include members of the DNC, Democratic governors, members of Congress and even former presidents. There could be many rounds of voting until a majority was reached.\n\ntoggle caption Sean Rayford/Getty Images/Getty Images North America\n\n\u2018Reality TV like you can't imagine\u2019\n\nConventions have been relatively suspenseless affairs since the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago. Starting with the 1972 election, party rules were changed to shift the power to pick the nominee from party power brokers to voters whose preferences are logged months before the convention.\n\nThe rules were adjusted again after the contentious 2016 Democratic primary to further dilute the influence of party leaders in favor of the preference of voters.\n\nAn open convention would be \u201creality TV like you can't imagine,\u201d said Kamarck. \u201cBut there is a procedure for doing it right. There's a procedure for running conventions that's well over 200 years old.\u201d\n\ntoggle caption Hulton Archive/Getty Images/Hulton Archive\n\nEssentially, she says, this is a return to a process that started in 1831 with the first convention and lasted through 1968. That year, President Lyndon B. Johnson dropped out early, in the face of anti-Vietnam war sentiment that was sinking his candidacy.\n\nThen, while the primary was still underway, Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated, leaving Vice President Hubert Humphrey to battle it out with anti-war Senator Eugene McCarthy.\n\nHumphrey came into the convention with the majority of delegates and left as the Democratic nominee, but the convention put an ugly intraparty battle on display with protests inside and outside the convention hall.\n\n\u201cLots of voters tuned in to these conventions because it was only at the conventions that you saw the real drama,\u201d said Kamarck.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nRepublican Richard Nixon won the election that November and Democrats instituted a series of reforms to the nominating process to give regular voters more say.",

        "text": "DNC Releases 2024 Party Platform Draft, Outlining Historic Record and Bold Agenda for President Biden and Vice President Harris to Finish the Job\nToday, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) released a draft of the 2024 Democratic Party Platform, featuring both the historic accomplishments of the Biden-Harris administration and a bold, progressive agenda for the next four years for President Biden, Vice President Harris, and Democrats to finish the job. The Platform focuses on priorities for Democrats up and down the ballot, from growing the economy to lowering costs for families; tackling the climate crisis and securing energy independence; closing the racial wealth gap and investing in small businesses; restoring Roe v. Wade as the law of the land; protecting communities from the scourge of gun violence and protecting freedoms for all Americans; and securing our border and strengthening American leadership worldwide.\n\n\u201cThis Platform highlights the progress that we\u2019ve made since day one of the Biden-Harris Administration and recommits Democrats up and down the ballot to our mission to give every American a fair shot,\u201d said DNC Chair Jaime Harrison. \u201cWhile Donald Trump and the RNC crafted an extreme MAGA Platform behind closed doors, we know that their real blueprint for a second Trump term is their toxic and dangerous Project 2025 wishlist to rip away Americans\u2019 freedoms, give handouts to billionaires on the backs of working people, and clear the path for Trump to be a dictator on \u2018day one.\u2019 The contrast couldn\u2019t be clearer. Our Drafting Committee incorporated a diverse set of expertise and perspectives, inviting Democrats from across the nation to participate in our process and contribute to our Platform. The breadth and depth of this Platform is rooted in our collective experience and reflects a bold agenda that affirms Democrats\u2019 commitment to protecting fundamental freedoms.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic Party Platform was drafted with input from individuals and organizations from across the United States through the 2024 Platform Written Testimony Portal, listening sessions, and Drafting Committee hearing testimony.\n\nThe Democratic Party\u2019s Platform and process stand in stark contrast to Donald Trump\u2019s RNC Platform, which was created behind closed doors and closed off entirely to the public and the press. Donald Trump placed the architects of Project 2025 at the helm of the RNC Platform Committee to help him implement his extreme agenda to institute a national abortion ban, give handouts to his billionaire donors on the backs of middle-class Americans, make cuts to Medicare and Social Security, and ensure he can be a dictator on \u201cday one.\u201d\n\nHighlights of the DNC Platform\n\nIn the past four years, Democrats have proven once again that democracy can deliver, and we have made tremendous progress. We\u2019ve created nearly 16 million jobs, prescription drug prices are coming down, and we\u2019re taking the most ambitious action in world history to fight climate change. We\u2019re seizing record amounts of fentanyl and securing our border in the face of Republican inaction, and strengthening NATO and restoring American leadership in the world. We\u2019ve worked to close the persistent racial wealth gap that has plagued our country for generations, with Black wealth climbing 60 percent since before the pandemic and Latino household wealth increasing by 19 percent in the last three years. We are still in a battle for the soul of our nation, and President Biden, Vice President Harris, and Democrats are running to finish the job.\n\nWhere the Democratic Platform fights to advance this bold agenda, Donald Trump and Project 2025 are planning to strip away Americans\u2019 freedoms and dismantle our democracy. The contrast could not be more stark.\n\nJoe Biden and Democrats\u2019 Plan to Grow Our Economy from the Bottom Up & Middle Out\n\nDemocrats are delivering on President Biden\u2019s pledge to rebuild our economy from the middle out and bottom up, not the top down. Since President Biden took office, this country has come back from the brink, the deficit has fallen by over $1 trillion, we have the best jobs record since John F. Kennedy, and we\u2019ve powered the strongest economic recovery in the world. We are breaking ground on over 57,000 projects across 4,500 communities nationwide and incentivizing a historic $877 billion in private funding across the United States, with companies investing hundreds of billions more than what they did under Trump to build new factories.\n\nWe\u2019ll accelerate implementation of our historic Investing in America agenda to bring back manufacturing and rebuild our infrastructure. We\u2019ll keep fighting to pass the PRO Act, to give everyone the right to organize for better pay, benefits, and working conditions and we\u2019ll finally raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. And, we\u2019ll keep expanding access to capital so that Americans can start and grow small businesses.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s Project 2025 Plans: Donald Trump is rigging our economy for his Mar-a-Lago friends and billionaire donors \u2013 who, like him, are only in it for themselves. As president, Trump doubled down on the trickle-down policies of the past, cutting investment in infrastructure and education, and rewarding big corporations that ship jobs and profits overseas. Trump vowed to bring new factories to communities across America, but left nothing behind but a string of broken promises. Project 2025 will make permanent Trump\u2019s MAGA tax scam of giving out massive tax handouts to America\u2019s wealthiest and big corporations while letting the middle class suffer.\n\nJoe Biden and Democrats\u2019 Plan to Reward Work, Not Wealth\n\nDemocrats are fighting to reward work, not wealth, and make the tax code fairer for the middle class, while making the wealthy and big corporations finally pay their fair share. Under President Biden\u2019s plan, no American earning less than $400,000 a year will pay more in federal taxes, period. We\u2019re working to end special interest giveaways, and to make sure all Americans play by the same rules. And our plan cuts the deficit by $3 trillion over the next decade.\n\nPresident Biden and Democrats will cut working families\u2019 taxes, including by restoring and making permanent the Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit. Democrats will make billionaires pay a minimum income tax so that they no longer pay an average tax rate lower than a firefighter or teacher. And, Democrats won\u2019t let corporations get away with paying $0 in taxes, raising the corporate tax rate and closing loopholes that special interests take advantage of.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s Project 2025 Plans: Donald Trump is focused on rigging the game for his billionaire donors. In 2017, he enacted a reckless, unpaid-for tax cut that overwhelmingly benefited the very wealthy and biggest corporations. Republicans are now doubling down on Trump\u2019s failed approach, vowing to make his tax scam permanent. They\u2019ll add $1 trillion in new corporate tax cuts. They\u2019ll repeal the estate tax, so the wealthiest 0.1 percent of Americans can pass wealth on to their heirs tax-free. They\u2019ll give American billionaires an average $3.5 million tax break, and House Republicans have vowed to cut Social Security and Medicare for everyone else to help foot the bill. Economists say Trump\u2019s billionaire giveaways and extreme tariffs will slow growth, cost jobs, and trigger a recession his first year back in office, raising taxes on middle-class families as much as $2,500, and adding trillions to the deficit. Project 2025 plans would further raise barriers for workers to unionize, question the need for public-sector unions, and impose greater reporting burdens on unions.\n\nJoe Biden and Democrats\u2019 Plan to Lower Costs\n\nToday, our economy is growing, wages are rising, and a record number of Americans have good jobs. But for too many hard-working families, the cost of living can still feel too high. Lowering costs is Democrats\u2019 number one economic priority. We have more to do, but our actions are already putting thousands of dollars a year back in people\u2019s pockets. We are saving millions of Americans an average of $800 a year on their health care premiums. We capped the price of insulin at $35 a month for nearly 4 million seniors on Medicare and are lowering the price of commonly used drugs for diabetes and heart failure. We capped rent hikes in 2 million apartments and are going after unfair rental \u201cjunk fees.\u201d Through record energy production of clean energy, oil, and gas, we\u2019ve lowered prices at the pump for American families. We approved the cancellation of $167 billion in loans for nearly 5 million borrowers, including a million public servants such as teachers, nurses, and police, and are expanding registered apprenticeships and job training opportunities.\n\nPresident Biden and Democrats will continue to lower the cost of health care, building on President Biden\u2019s historic action allowing Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices by growing the list by at least 50 drugs a year. And he will stand firm to protect Social Security and expand benefits, and make Medicare permanently solvent by making the wealthy pay their fair share in taxes. Democrats will guarantee affordable, quality child care to millions of working families for less than $10 a day per child. And, we\u2019ll lower housing costs by building or renovating 2 million homes nationwide. We will take on corporate greed by banning \u201cjunk fees\u201d and holding companies accountable for price gouging.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s Project 2025 Plans: Donald Trump hasn\u2019t offered a single solution to lower families\u2019 costs. He wants to drag America backward with extreme import tariffs that will make life more expensive for folks nationwide. And for those corporations that are raising prices and making historic profits, Trump wants to give them a massive tax cut. Independent analysts say his MAGA tax and tariff plans will in fact increase inflation, cost 3 million American jobs, and slow growth, triggering a recession in his first year back in office. Trump\u2019s plan will increase costs for working families as much as $2,500 a year.\n\nHouse Republicans have also vowed to cut Social Security by over $1.5 trillion, to raise the retirement age, and to transform Medicare into a voucher-like system, threatening the program. Project 2025 would effectively dismantle the Department of Education entirely and eliminate important programs like Head Start, and would bring a return to the gold standard, effectively abolishing the Federal Reserve, which researchers, economists, and history tell us could lead to economic downturns, inflation, and currency instability.\n\nJoe Biden and Democrats\u2019 Plan to Tackle the Climate Crisis, Lower Energy Costs, and Secure Energy Independence\n\nPresident Biden is delivering the most aggressive climate agenda in history. His landmark legislation has unleashed a clean energy boom that\u2019s reducing pollution, lowering energy costs, and has already created over 300,000 good-paying American jobs. He is on track to protect more of America\u2019s lands and waters than any president before him, and he has restored our global climate leadership. He is positioning America to lead the future \u2013 energy independent, resilient, innovative, and strong.\n\nDemocrats will scale up solar, wind, and geothermal projects made possible by the Inflation Reduction Act and invest in clean energy R&D to build America\u2019s legacy as a nation of new frontiers and possibilities. President Biden will expand the clean energy workforce, with a goal of tripling the size of the American Climate Corps by the end of this decade and making sure the clean energy and manufacturing jobs of tomorrow are open and accessible to communities that have been too often left out in the past. We\u2019ll also eliminate tens of billions of dollars in unfair oil and gas subsidies and hold oil and gas executives accountable for potential collusion or price gouging. We will continue to implement the president\u2019s Executive Order on Environmental Justice for all.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s Project 2025 Plans: Donald Trump is still trying to deny what we all see happening right before our eyes. He told oil executives he\u2019d reverse our climate progress and slash their taxes once more \u2013 if they\u2019d give him $1 billion for his campaign. He wants to roll back the clean energy progress that President Biden has made, gut the Environmental Protection Agency, and let polluters dump dangerous PFAS chemicals in our water. Project 2025 calls to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act, President Biden\u2019s signature legislation that is the largest investment in climate in history, questions the existence of the climate crisis altogether, empowers Trump to reject climate science and gut the federal government\u2019s ability to research climate solutions and eliminate NOAA, and repeals federal protections of national parks.\n\nJoe Biden and Democrats\u2019 Plan to Protect Communities & Tackle Gun Violence\n\nAll Americans deserve freedom from fear, women deserve a president who has committed his life to ending violence against women, and families deserve a president who has delivered safer neighborhoods. Under President Biden and Vice President Harris, in 2023, the murder rate saw the sharpest decrease in history and violent crime fell to one of the lowest levels in more than 50 years. Democrats made the largest-ever federal investment in public safety and violence prevention, putting more police officers on beat for accountable community policing. We need to fund the police, not defund the police. President Biden and Vice President Harris and Democrats in Congress defeated the gun lobby and passed the first significant federal gun safety law in nearly 30 years. President Biden took historic action by pardoning people convicted federally for using or possessing marijuana.\n\nDemocrats will take on common sense solutions to gun violence, including universal background checks, safe storage requirements, and a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. President Biden will advance his Safer America Plan, which calls on Congress to invest $37 billion to support law enforcement and crime prevention \u2013 including funding for 100,000 additional police officers for accountable community policing and investing $5 billion in community violence interventions, building trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve. Democrats will also take action to expunge federal marijuana-only convictions.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s Project 2025 Plans: Trump oversaw the largest one-year increase in murders ever recorded, including a 35% increase in murders committed with guns. While President Biden has stood up to the gun lobby, Trump is proud of doing their bidding. He refused to limit the use of high-capacity magazines after a Las Vegas shooter used a dozen 100-round magazines to kill 58 people. And, when confronted with horrific gun violence, he tells families to \u201cget over it.\u201d On January 6, he encouraged the rioters who attacked the police officers protecting our Capitol \u2014 and since then, he has promised to pardon these convicted criminals. As president, he repeatedly proposed cutting funding to state and local law enforcement programs; he proposed cutting the COPS program that funds local police officers for three years in a row, including a $244 million cut in FY2021. He\u2019s called to defund the Department of Justice and the FBI. And, he says he will withhold federal funding from local police departments that don\u2019t adopt policies like stop-and-frisk or assist in mass deportations. If enacted, Project 2025 would weaken racial discrimination standards and endanger communities of color.\n\nJoe Biden and Democrats\u2019 Plan to Strengthen Democracy, Protect Freedoms, & Advance Equity\n\nPresident Biden, Vice President Harris, and Democrats know that democracy has always been America\u2019s sacred cause. Whether that\u2019s still true is the most urgent question of our time, and it\u2019s what the 2024 election is all about. When President Biden took office, the nation was reeling from what it had just witnessed on January 6: a violent mob that stormed the Capitol, smashing windows, kicking in doors, attacking scores of police officers and roaming the corridors hunting for elected officials \u2013 all whipped into a frenzy by Donald Trump\u2019s lies, repeated over and over again for months, to overturn the will of the people.\n\nIn his second term in office, President Biden, Vice President Harris, and Democrats will continue to work every day to ensure that our democracy endures. President Biden will appoint more justices and judges across the federal bench like Justice Jackson: brilliant jurists who are committed to defending American rights and freedoms. Democrats in Congress will pass, and President Biden will sign, the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act to fully secure the right to vote in every state, ensure fair congressional maps for every American, modernize and secure our elections, and curtail the corrupting influence of money in politics. President Biden, Vice President Harris, and Democrats are committed to restoring the reproductive rights Trump ripped away and will pass a law codifying the protections of Roe, strengthen access to contraception, protect a woman\u2019s right to access IVF, and support access to FDA-approved medication abortion. Democrats will also keep fighting to address racial inequities, from health care to education to housing.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s Project 2025 Plans: Donald Trump is a greater danger than ever. He still doesn\u2019t accept that he lost in 2020, and he has never agreed to accept the results of this year\u2019s election. He has spent years undermining public faith and confidence in our elections, and warned of a \u201cbloodbath\u201d if he loses now. He lionizes the convicted criminals who perpetrated the January 6 attack on our Capitol and on our brave police, calling the insurrectionists \u201cpatriots\u201d and \u201chostages,\u201d and promises to pardon them. He\u2019s promised to be a dictator on \u201cDay One\u201d \u2014 and we\u2019ve already seen how he fawns over other dictators. He\u2019s vowed to weaponize the government to go after his enemies and benefit his allies. He has plans to fire dedicated, nonpolitical civil servants and replace them with loyalists who will do his bidding. And to silence his critics, he suggested the \u201ctermination\u201d of our Constitution.\n\nJoe Biden and Democrats\u2019 Plan to Secure our Border & Fix the Broken Immigration System\n\nOn his first day in office, President Biden sent Congress legislation to secure our border, fix our immigration system, and provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and others. This past year, the President worked across the aisle and negotiated a bipartisan deal that included the toughest and fairest set of reforms to secure the border in decades. It would have made our country safer and made our border more secure, it would have funded new technology and personnel to catch fentanyl and go after drug traffickers, while treating people fairly and humanely and expanding legal immigration, consistent with our values as a nation. Congress failed to act because Republicans, led by Donald Trump, would rather play politics than solve problems. President Biden hasn\u2019t waited to act \u2013 and his actions have led to border encounters going down by over 50 percent. The current level is lower today than when Trump left office.\n\nIn President Biden\u2019s second term, he will push Congress to pass legislation that is consistent with our values as a nation. Legislation must secure the border, reform the asylum system, expand legal immigration; and keep families together by supporting long-term undocumented individuals, including Dreamers. President Biden has taken action to advance each of these goals, but lasting, comprehensive reforms require congressional action.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s Project 2025 Plans: Trump\u2019s plans for a second term will devastate our economy, tear families apart, and do nothing to strengthen our immigration system. Trump has said that if he\u2019s elected, he\u2019ll move to immediately deport millions of undocumented immigrants, including those who have lived in and contributed to this country for years. He and his allies have also promised to end birthright citizenship, ignore the Constitution and Supreme Court precedent and bar undocumented children from public schools, and once again separate children from their families. Trump\u2019s plans are out of line with American values, and \u2013 under Trump\u2019s orders \u2013 Congressional Republicans are currently blocking President Biden\u2019s bipartisan border security proposals because they lack the courage to stand up to Trump. Project 2025 plans would discredit asylum seekers\u2019 fear of persecution and allow for immigration raids in \u201csensitive\u201d zones, including schools, churches, hospitals, playgrounds, and more.\n\nJoe Biden and Democrats\u2019 Unity Agenda\n\nDuring his first State of the Union, President Biden outlined a unity agenda to make progress solving big challenges that Americans have in common: beating the opioid epidemic, tackling the mental health crisis, holding Big Tech accountable, ending cancer as we know it, and meeting our nation\u2019s sacred obligation to veterans. Under President Biden\u2019s leadership, Democrats worked across the aisle to make real progress on these critical issues. We\u2019re providing life-saving treatment for opioid use disorder to end the epidemic, making historic investments in mental health care to help struggling Americans, establishing new high standards for AI safety and protecting American privacy, bringing together providers, insurers, and researchers to work toward ending cancer, and passed the PACT Act to expand health care benefits to veterans.\n\nDemocrats will continue critical investments to curb opioid overdoses, including expanding access to life-saving medication and care for Americans struggling with addiction. Democrats will increase access to mental health care, and push to expand 988 \u2014 the National Suicide & Crisis Lifeline launched by the Biden-Harris Administration \u2014 to serve more Americans. Democrats are determined to strengthen data privacy, protect kids online, and hold companies accountable for the harm they cause.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s Project 2025 Plans: Donald Trump divides us for his own political game. He refuses to reach across the aisle to deliver results for working families, and Project 2025 plans would endanger veterans\u2019 benefits, cut Medicaid benefits for those who need it most, and end health care protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nJoe Biden and Democrats\u2019 Plan to Strengthen American Leadership Worldwide\n\nWhen he entered office, President Biden moved to quickly and decisively repair the damage that Trump had done to America\u2019s relationships with our allies and our reputation around the world. Trump\u2019s America first strategy meant America was alone, less secure, less prosperous, and with American leadership and values falling behind worldwide. By reinvesting in America\u2019s manufacturing base, leveling the playing field for American workers, and standing alongside our allies to support democracies and push back against autocracy, President Biden has bolstered our national security and is investing in a future where America will continue to lead on the world stage. President Biden and Democrats believe at this decisive moment we must demonstrate that democracy can still deliver for our people. We must rally the world to address the challenges that impact all of us \u2013 from climate change and global health to human rights, technology, food security, and inclusive economic growth. President Biden understands that leading abroad means being strong and resilient at home. He also knows that the United States is strongest when our partners are strong too.\n\nPresident Biden will never turn his back on our allies. In his second term, he will continue to strengthen NATO and stand with Ukraine to stop Putin\u2019s atrocities and constrain Russia\u2019s threat to allied nations and America\u2019s vital interests. President Biden will remain focused on actions at home and abroad to outcompete China, while responsibly managing the relationship with the PRC to avoid a costly spiral to conflict. President Biden remains committed to a durable peace in the Middle East bolstered by regional integration and a negotiated two-state solution that ensures Israel\u2019s future as a Jewish and democratic state with recognized borders and upholds the right of Palestinians to live in freedom and security in a viable state of their own.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s Project 2025 Plans: Donald Trump made America less safe by significantly straining U.S. alliances and emboldening autocratic regimes, while weakening global democratic norms. He insulted our allies and withdrew from international agreements and organizations that were in the national security interest. Trump praises dictators, including Vladimir Putin, attempted to weaken the NATO alliance, and pledged to allow Putin to do \u201cwhatever they hell he wants\u201d to our NATO allies. And, he repeatedly disrespected the brave men and women in the U.S. military calling them \u201csuckers\u201d and \u201closers.\u201d",

        "text": "Unbowed by Jan. 6 Charges, Republicans Pursue Plans to Contest a Trump Defeat\nThe Republican Party and its conservative allies are engaged in an unprecedented legal campaign targeting the American voting system. Their wide-ranging and methodical effort is laying the groundwork to contest an election that they argue, falsely, is already being rigged against former President Donald J. Trump.\n\nThe campaign involves a powerful network of Republican lawyers and activist groups, working loosely in concert with the Republican National Committee. Many of the key players were active in Mr. Trump\u2019s attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nBut unlike the chaotic and improvised challenge four years ago, the new drive includes a systematic search for any vulnerability in the nation\u2019s patchwork election system.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s allies have followed a two-pronged approach: restricting voting for partisan advantage ahead of Election Day and short-circuiting the process of ratifying the winner afterward, if Mr. Trump loses. The latter strategy involves an ambitious \u2014 and legally dubious \u2014 attempt to reimagine decades of settled law dictating how results are officially certified in the weeks before the transfer of power.",

        "text": "Elon Musk makes 'sizeable' donation to Donald Trump's presidential campaign ahead of US election 2024\nTesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk has made a \u201csizeable\u201d donation towards the presidential campaign of former US President Donald Trump. Elon Musk made a donation to a super political action committee working to elect Donald Trump to the White House once again, reported Bloomberg. Former US President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk(Reuters)\n\nElon Musk, who is the richest person in the world as per the billionaire's index, contributed to a low-profile group called America PAC, which is working on the presidential campaign of Donald Trump. The exact amount of the donation currently remains undisclosed, but people familiar with the matter described it as a \u201csizeable\u201d donation. The PAC is next required to disclose its list of donors on July 15.\n\nThe tech mogul, who has a net worth of over $263 billion, has earlier insisted that he prefers to stay out of politics and described himself as a political independent. However, Musk has recently become a figure who regularly uses his X social-media platform to espouse right-leaning views and assail Democrats, especially closer to the US election 2024.\n\nThe money injection from Musk comes at a time when Trump has overtaken his rival, President Joe Biden, in fundraising with the help of deep-pocketed Wall Street and corporate donors. Biden\u2019s own money raising has dropped off following a calamitous debate that led prominent Democratic donors to put away their checkbooks.\n\nElon Musk has not yet publicly endorsed any political leader in the 2024 presidential race, and had said earlier this year that he did not anticipate financing either Trump or Biden\u2019s election efforts. However, his hefty donation towards Trump's campaign presents an opportunity for him to become a financial juggernaut for Republicans.\n\nThis is shaping up to be the most expensive US presidential election in history, with America PAC is the biggest spender on direct voter contacts. It has spent $15.8 million so far, with $13.1 million of that going for field operations, federal records show. It has also paid for digital media, texting and phone calls to reach voters.\n\nWhile Trump and Elon Musk have clashed in the past multiple times over free speech issues, the two have grown closer with the tech entrepreneur advising the former president on electric vehicles and crypto policy.\n\n(With inputs from Bloomberg)",

It\u2019s spending millions to make a big political push for this election \u2014 but it may be violating the law.\n\nZiklag, an invitation-only charity organization for rich Christians, aims to take dominion over what it sees as the seven major spheres of public life, which it calls \u201cmountains\u201d: business, science and technology, family, arts and media, church, education and government.\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they\u2019re published.\n\nA network of ultrawealthy Christian donors is spending nearly $12 million to mobilize Republican-leaning voters and purge more than a million people from the rolls in key swing states, aiming to tilt the 2024 election in favor of former President Donald Trump.\n\nThese previously unreported plans are the work of a group named Ziklag, a little-known charity whose donors have included some of the wealthiest conservative Christian families in the nation, including the billionaire Uihlein family, who made a fortune in office supplies, the Greens, who run Hobby Lobby, and the Wallers, who own the Jockey apparel corporation. Recipients of Ziklag\u2019s largesse include Alliance Defending Freedom, which is the Christian legal group that led the overturning of Roe v. Wade, plus the national pro-Trump group Turning Point USA and a constellation of right-of-center advocacy groups.\n\nProPublica and Documented obtained thousands of Ziklag\u2019s members-only email newsletters, internal videos, strategy documents and fundraising pitches, none of which has been previously made public. They reveal the group\u2019s 2024 plans and its long-term goal to underpin every major sphere of influence in American society with Christianity. In the Bible, the city of Ziklag was where David and his soldiers found refuge during their war with King Saul.\n\n\u201cWe are in a spiritual battle and locked in a terrible conflict with the powers of darkness,\u201d says a strategy document that lays out Ziklag\u2019s 30-year vision to \u201credirect the trajectory of American culture toward Christ by bringing back Biblical structure, order and truth to our Nation.\u201d\n\nZiklag\u2019s 2024 agenda reads like the work of a political organization. It plans to pour money into mobilizing voters in Arizona who are \u201csympathetic to Republicans\u201d in order to secure \u201c10,640 additional unique votes\u201d \u2014 almost the exact margin of President Joe Biden\u2019s win there in 2020. The group also intends to use controversial AI software to enable mass challenges to the eligibility of hundreds of thousands of voters in competitive states.\n\nIn a recording of a 2023 internal strategy discussion, a Ziklag official stressed that the objective was the same in other swing states. \u201cThe goal is to win,\u201d the official said. \u201cIf 75,000 people wins the White House, then how do we get 150,000 people so we make sure we win?\u201d\n\nAccording to the Ziklag files, the group has divided its 2024 activities into three different operations targeting voters in battleground states: Checkmate, focused on funding so-called election integrity groups; Steeplechase, concentrated on using churches and pastors to get out the vote; and Watchtower, aimed at galvanizing voters around the issues of \u201cparental rights\u201d and opposition to transgender rights and policies supporting health care for trans people.\n\nIn a member briefing video, one of Ziklag\u2019s spiritual advisers outlined a plan to \u201cdeliver swing states\u201d by using an anti-transgender message to motivate conservative voters who are exhausted with Trump.\n\nBut Ziklag is not a political organization: It is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt charity, the same legal designation as the United Way or Boys and Girls Club. Such organizations do not have to publicly disclose their funders, and donations are tax deductible. In exchange, they are \u201cabsolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office,\u201d according to the IRS.\n\nProPublica and Documented presented the findings of their investigation to six nonpartisan lawyers and legal experts. All expressed concern that Ziklag was testing or violating the law.\n\nThe reporting by ProPublica and Documented \u201ccasts serious doubt on this organization\u2019s status as a 501(c)(3) organization,\u201d said Roger Colinvaux, a professor at Catholic University\u2019s Columbus School of Law.\n\nProPublica Get Our Top Investigations Subscribe to the Big Story newsletter.

Martin Nussbaum, an attorney who said he was the group\u2019s general counsel, said in a written response that \u201csome of the statements in your email are correct. Others are not,\u201d but he then did not respond to a request to specify what was erroneous. The group is seeking to \u201calign\u201d the culture \u201cwith Biblical values and the American constitution, and that they will serve the common good,\u201d he wrote. Using the official tax name for Ziklag, he wrote that \u201cUSATransForm does not endorse candidates for public office.\u201d He declined to comment on the group\u2019s members.\n\nThere are no bright lines or magic words that the IRS might look for when it investigates a charitable organization for engaging in political intervention, said Mayer. Instead, the agency examines the facts and circumstances of a group\u2019s activities and makes a conclusion about whether the group violated the law.\n\nThe biggest risk for charities that intervene in political campaigns, Mayer said, is loss of their tax-exempt status. Donors\u2019 ability to deduct their donations can be a major sell, not to mention it can create \u201ca halo effect\u201d for the group, Mayer added.\n\n\u201cThey may be able to get more money this way,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cIt boils down to tax evasion at the end of the day.\u201d\n\n\u201cDominion Over the Seven Mountains\u201d\n\nZiklag has largely escaped scrutiny until now. The group describes itself as a \u201cprivate, confidential, invitation-only community of high-net-worth Christian families.\u201d\n\nAccording to internal documents, it boasts more than 125 members that include business executives, pastors, media leaders and other prominent conservative Christians. Potential new members, one document says, should have a \u201cconcern for culture\u201d demonstrated by past donations to faith-based or political causes, as well as a net worth of $25 million or more. None of the donors responded to requests for comment.\n\nTax records show rapid growth in the group\u2019s finances in recent years. Its annual revenue climbed from $1.3 million in 2018 to $6 million in 2019 and nearly $12 million in 2022, which is the latest filing available.\n\nThe group\u2019s spending is not on the scale of major conservative funders such as Miriam Adelson or Barre Seid, the electronics magnate who gave $1.6 billion to a group led by conservative legal activist Leonard Leo. But its funding and strategy represent one of the clearest links yet between the Christian right and the \u201celection integrity\u201d movement fueled by Trump\u2019s baseless claims about voting fraud. Even several million dollars funding mass challenges to voters in swing counties can make an impact, legal and election experts say.\n\nZiklag was the brainchild of a Silicon Valley entrepreneur named Ken Eldred. It emerged from a previous organization founded by Eldred called United In Purpose, which aimed to get more Christians active in the civic arena, according to Bill Dallas, the group\u2019s former director. United In Purpose generated attention in June 2016 when it organized a major meeting between then-candidate Trump and hundreds of evangelical leaders.\n\nAfter Trump was elected in 2016, Eldred had an idea, according to Dallas. \u201cHe says, \u2018I want all the wealthy Christian people to come together,\u2019\u201d Dallas recalled in an interview. Eldred told Dallas that he wanted to create a donor network like the one created by Charles and David Koch but for Christians. He proposed naming it David\u2019s Mighty Men, Dallas said. Female members balked. Dallas found the passage in Chronicles that references David\u2019s soldiers and read that they met in the city of Ziklag, and so they chose the name Ziklag.\n\nThe group\u2019s stature grew after Trump took office. Vice President Mike Pence appeared at a Ziklag event, as did former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, Sen. Ted Cruz, then-Rep. Mark Meadows and other members of Congress. In its private newsletter, Ziklag claims that a coalition of groups it assembled played \u201ca hugely significant role in the selection, hearings and confirmation process\u201d of Amy Coney Barrett for a Supreme Court seat in late 2020.\n\nConfidential donor networks regularly invest hundreds of millions of dollars into political and charitable groups, from the liberal Democracy Alliance to the Koch-affiliated Stand Together organization on the right. But unlike Ziklag, neither of those organizations is legally set up as a true charity.\n\nZiklag appears to be the first coordinated effort to get wealthy donors to fund an overtly Christian nationalist agenda, according to historians, legal experts and other people familiar with the group. \u201cIt shows that this idea isn\u2019t being dismissed as fringe in the way that it might have been in the past,\u201d said Mary Ziegler, a legal historian and University of California, Davis law professor.\n\nThe Christian nationalism movement has a variety of aims and tenets, according to the Public Religion Research Institute: that the U.S. government \u201cshould declare America a Christian nation\u201d; that American laws \u201cshould be based on Christian values\u201d; that the U.S. will cease to exist as a nation if it \u201cmoves away from our Christian foundations\u201d; that being Christian is essential to being American; and that God has \u201ccalled Christians to exercise dominion over all areas of American society.\u201d\n\nOne theology promoted by Christian nationalist leaders is the Seven Mountain Mandate. Each mountain represents a major industry or a sphere of public life: arts and media, business, church, education, family, government, and science and technology. Ziklag\u2019s goal, the documents say, is to \u201ctake dominion over the Seven Mountains,\u201d funding Christian projects or installing devout Christians in leadership positions to reshape each mountain in a godly way.\n\nTo address their concerns about education, Ziklag\u2019s leaders and allies have focused on the public-school system. In a 2021 Ziklag meeting, Ziklag\u2019s education mountain chair, Peter Bohlinger, said that Ziklag\u2019s goal \u201cis to take down the education system as we know it today.\u201d The producers of the film \u201cSound of Freedom,\u201d featuring Jim Caviezel as an anti-sex-trafficking activist, screened an early cut of the film at a Ziklag conference and asked for funds, according to Dallas.\n\nAn excerpt from Ziklag\u2019s \u201cDeclaration and 30-Year Vision for the Mountains of Influence.\u201d The document outlines Ziklag\u2019s mission to reshape each major aspect of American society so that it operates according to a biblical worldview. Credit: Obtained by ProPublica and Documented\n\nThe Seven Mountains theology signals a break from Christian fundamentalists such as Jerry Falwell Sr. and Pat Robertson. In the 1980s and \u201990s, Falwell\u2019s Moral Majority focused on working within the democratic process to mobilize evangelical voters and elect politicians with a Christian worldview.\n\nThe Seven Mountains theology embraces a different, less democratic approach to gaining power. \u201cIf the Moral Majority is about galvanizing the voters, the Seven Mountains is a revolutionary model: You need to conquer these mountains and let change flow down from the top,\u201d said Matthew Taylor, a senior scholar at the Institute for Islamic, Christian and Jewish Studies and an expert on Christian nationalism. \u201cIt\u2019s an outlined program for Christian supremacy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Amorphous, Tumultuous Wild West\u201d\n\nThe Christian right has had compelling spokespeople and fierce commitment to its causes, whether they were ending abortion rights, allowing prayer in schools or displaying the Ten Commandments outside of public buildings. What the movement has often lacked, its leaders argue, is sufficient funding.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the right, especially the Christian right, there were always complaints about money,\u201d said legal historian Ziegler. \u201cThere\u2019s a perceived gap of \u2018We aren\u2019t getting the support from big-name, big-dollar donors that we deserve and want and need.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s where Ziklag comes in.\n\nSpeaking late last year to an invitation-only gathering of Ziklaggers, as members are known, Charlie Kirk, who leads the pro-Trump Turning Point USA organization, named left-leaning philanthropists who were, in his view, funding the destruction of the nation: MacKenzie Scott, ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos; billionaire investor and liberal philanthropist George Soros; and the two founders of Google, Larry Page and Sergey Brin.\n\n\u201cWhy are secular people giving more generously than Christians?\u201d Kirk asked, according to a recording of his remarks. \u201cIt would be a tragedy,\u201d he added, \u201cif people who hate life, hate our country, hate beauty and hate God wanted it more than us.\u201d\n\n\u201cZiklag is the place,\u201d Kirk told the donors. \u201cZiklag is the counter.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Pence, in a 2021 appearance at a private Ziklag event, praised the group for its role in \u201cchanging lives, and it\u2019s advanced the cause, it\u2019s advanced the kingdom.\u201d\n\nA driving force behind Ziklag\u2019s efforts is Lance Wallnau, a prominent Christian evangelist and influencer based in Texas who is described by Ziklag as a \u201cSeven Mountains visionary & advisor.\u201d The fiery preacher is one of the most influential figures on the Christian right, experts say, a bridge between Christian nationalism and Trump. He was one of the earliest evangelical leaders to endorse Trump in 2015 and later published a book titled \u201cGod\u2019s Chaos Candidate: Donald J. Trump and the American Unraveling.\u201d More than 1 million people follow him on Facebook. He doesn\u2019t try to hide his views: \u201cYes, I am a Christian nationalist,\u201d he said during one of his livestreams in 2021. (Wallnau did not respond to requests for comment.)\n\nDonald Trump shakes hands with Lance Wallnau, a self-described Christian nationalist. Credit: Lancewallnau.com\n\nWallnau has remained a Trump ally. He called Trump\u2019s time in office a \u201cspiritual warfare presidency\u201d and popularized the idea that Trump was a \u201cmodern-day Cyrus,\u201d referring to the Persian king who defeated the Babylonians and allowed the Jewish people to return to Jerusalem. Wallnau has visited with Trump at the White House and Trump Tower; last November, he livestreamed from a black-tie gala at Mar-a-Lago where Trump spoke.\n\nWallnau did not come up with the notion that Christians should try to take control of key areas of American society. But he improved on the idea by introducing the concept of the seven mountains and urged Christians to set about conquering them. The concept caught on, said Taylor, because it empowered Christians with a sense of purpose in every sphere of life.\n\nAs a preacher in the independent charismatic tradition, a fast-growing offshoot of Pentecostalism that is unaffiliated with any major denomination, Wallnau and his acolytes believe that God speaks to and through modern-day apostles and prophets \u2014 a version of Christianity that Taylor, in his forthcoming book \u201cThe Violent Take It By Force,\u201d describes as \u201cthe amorphous, tumultuous Wild West of the modern church.\u201d Wallnau and his ideas lingered at the fringes of American Christianity for years, until the boost from the Trump presidency.\n\nThe Ziklag files detail not only what Christians should do to conquer all seven mountains, but also what their goals will be once they\u2019ve taken the summit. For the government mountain, one key document says that \u201cthe biblical role of government is to promote good and punish evil\u201d and that \u201cthe word of God and prayer play a significant role in policy decisions.\u201d\n\nFor the arts and entertainment mountain, goals include that 80% of the movies produced be rated G or PG \u201cwith a moral story,\u201d and that many people who work in the industry \u201coperate under a biblical/moral worldview.\u201d The education section says that homeschooling should be a \u201cfundamental right\u201d and the government \u201cmust not favor one form of education over another.\u201d\n\nOther internal Ziklag documents voice strong opposition to same-sex marriage and transgender rights. One reads: \u201ctransgender acceptance = Final sign before imminent collapse.\u201d\n\nHeading into the 2024 election year, Ziklag executive director Drew Hiss warned members in an internal video that \u201clooming above and beyond those seven mountains is this evil force that\u2019s been manifesting itself.\u201d He described it as \u201ca controlling, evil, diabolical presence, really, with tyranny in mind.\u201d That presence was concentrated in the government mountain, he said. If Ziklaggers wanted to save their country from \u201cthe powers of darkness,\u201d they needed to focus their energies on that government mountain or else none of their work in any other area would succeed.\n\n\u201cOperation Checkmate\u201d\n\nIn the fall of 2023, Wallnau sat in a gray armchair in his TV studio. A large TV screen behind him flashed a single word: \u201cZIKLAG.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou almost hate to put it out this clearly,\u201d he said as he detailed Ziklag\u2019s electoral strategy, \u201cbecause if somebody else gets ahold of this, they\u2019ll freak out.\u201d\n\nHe was joined on set by Hiss, who had just become the group\u2019s new day-to-day leader. The two men were there to record a special message to Ziklag members that laid out the group\u2019s ambitious plans for the upcoming election year.\n\nThe forces arrayed against Christians were many, according to the confidential video. They were locked in a \u201cspiritual battle,\u201d Hiss said, against Democrats who were a \u201cradical left Marxist force.\u201d Biden, Wallnau said, was a senile old man and \u201can empty suit with an agenda that\u2019s written and managed by somebody else.\u201d\n\nWallnau speaks with Drew Hiss, Ziklag\u2019s executive director, about the group\u2019s goals for political engagement. Credit: Obtained by ProPublica and Documented\n\nIn the files, Ziklag says it plans to give out nearly $12 million to a constellation of groups working on the ground to shift the 2024 electorate in favor of Trump and other Republicans.\n\nA prominent conservative getting money from Ziklag is Cleta Mitchell, a lawyer and Trump ally who joined the January 2021 phone call when then-President Trump asked Georgia\u2019s secretary of state to \u201cfind\u201d enough votes to flip Georgia in Trump\u2019s favor.\n\nMitchell now leads a network of \u201celection integrity\u201d coalitions in swing states that have spent the last three years advocating for changes to voting rules and how elections are run. According to one internal newsletter, Ziklag was an early funder of Mitchell\u2019s post-2020 \u201celection integrity\u201d activism, which voting-rights experts have criticized for stoking unfounded fears about voter fraud and seeking to unfairly remove people from voting rolls. In 2022, Ziklag donated $600,000 to the Conservative Partnership Institute, which in turn funds Mitchell\u2019s election-integrity work. Internal Ziklag documents show that it provided funding to enable Mitchell to set up election integrity infrastructure in Florida, North Carolina and Wisconsin.\n\nNow Mitchell is promoting a tool called EagleAI, which has claimed to use artificial intelligence to automate and speed up the process of challenging ineligible voters. EagleAI is already being used to mount mass challenges to the eligibility of hundreds of thousands of voters in competitive states, and, with Ziklag\u2019s help, the group plans to ramp up those efforts.\n\nAccording to an internal video, Ziklag plans to invest $800,000 in \u201cEagleAI\u2019s clean the rolls project,\u201d which would be one of the largest known donations to the group.\n\nConservative lawyer Cleta Mitchell, seen speaking at an event with then-President Donald Trump, received funding from Ziklag for her efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. Credit: Anna Moneymaker/The New York Times/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nZiklag lists two key objectives for Operation Checkmate: \u201cSecure 10,640 additional unique votes in Arizona (mirroring the 2020 margin of 10,447 votes), and remove up to one million ineligible registrations and around 280,000 ineligible voters in Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, and Wisconsin.\u201d\n\nIn a recording of an internal Zoom call, Ziklag\u2019s Mark Bourgeois stressed the electoral value of targeting Arizona. \u201cI care about Maricopa County,\u201d Bourgeois said at one point, referring to Arizona\u2019s largest county, which Biden won four years ago. \u201cThat\u2019s how we win.\u201d\n\nFor Operation Watchtower, Wallnau explained in a members-only video that transgender policy was a \u201cwedge issue\u201d that could be decisive in turning out voters tired of hearing about Trump.\n\nThe left had won the battle over the \u201chomosexual issue,\u201d Wallnau said. \u201cBut on transgenderism, there\u2019s a problem and they know it.\u201d He continued: \u201cThey\u2019re gonna wanna talk about Trump, Trump, Trump. \u2026 Meanwhile, if we talk about \u2018It\u2019s not about Trump. It\u2019s about parents and their children, and the state is a threat,\u2019\u201d that could be the \u201ctarget on the forehead of Goliath.\u201d\n\nThe Ziklag files describe tactics the group plans to use around parental rights \u2014 policies that make it easier for parents to control what\u2019s taught in public schools \u2014 to turn out conservative voters. In a fundraising video, the group says it plans to underwrite a \u201cmessaging and data lab\u201d focused on parental rights that will supply \u201cwinning messaging to all our partner groups to create unified focus among all on the right.\u201d The goal, the video says, is to make parental rights \u201cthe difference-maker in the 2024 election.\u201d\n\nAccording to Wallnau, Ziklag also plans to fund ballot initiatives in seven key states \u2014 Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Michigan, Montana, Nevada and Ohio \u2014 that take aim at the transgender community by seeking to ban \u201cgenital mutilation.\u201d The seven states targeted are either presidential battlegrounds or have competitive U.S. Senate races. None of the initiatives is on a state ballot yet.\n\n\u201cPeople that are lethargic about the election or, worse yet, they\u2019re gonna be all Trump-traumatized with the news cycle \u2014 this issue will get people to come out and vote,\u201d Wallnau said. \u201cThat ballot initiative can deliver swing states.\u201d\n\nThe last prong of Ziklag\u2019s 2024 strategy is Operation Steeplechase, which urges conservative pastors to mobilize their congregants to vote in this year\u2019s election. This project will work in coordination with several prominent conservative groups that support former president Trump\u2019s reelection, such as Turning Point USA\u2019s faith-based group, the Faith and Freedom Coalition run by conservative operative Ralph Reed and the America First Policy Institute, one of several groups closely allied with Trump.\n\nZiklag\u2019s website outlines its three major operations and which mountains each one targets. Credit: Screenshot by ProPublica\n\nZiklag says in a 2023 internal video that it and its allies will \u201ccoordinate extensive pastor and church outreach through pastor summits, church-focused messaging and events and the creation of pastor resources.\u201d As preacher and activist John Amanchukwu said at a Ziklag event, \u201cWe need a church that\u2019s willing to do anything and everything to get to the point where we reclaim that which was stolen from us.\u201d\n\nSix tax experts reviewed the election-related strategy discussions and tactics reported in this story. All of them said the activities tested or ran afoul of the law governing 501(c)(3) charities. The IRS and the Texas attorney general, which would oversee the Southlake, Texas, charity, did not respond to questions.\n\nWhile not all of its political efforts appeared to be clear-cut violations, the experts said, others may be: The stated plan to mobilize voters \u201csympathetic to Republicans,\u201d Ziklag officials openly discussing the goal to win the election, and Wallnau\u2019s call to fund ballot initiatives that would \u201cdeliver swing states\u201d while at the same time voicing explicit criticism of Biden all raised red flags, the experts said.\n\nProPublica Read More Segregation Academies in Mississippi Are Benefiting From Public Dollars, as They Did in the 1960s\n\n\u201cI am troubled about a tax-exempt charitable organization that\u2019s set up and its main operation seems to be to get people to win office,\u201d said Phil Hackney, a professor of law at the University of Pittsburgh and an expert on tax-exempt organizations.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re planning an election effort,\u201d said Marcus Owens, a tax lawyer at Loeb and Loeb and a former director of the IRS\u2019 exempt organizations division. \u201cThat\u2019s not a 501(c)(3) activity.\u201d\n\nDo You Have a Tip for ProPublica?

        "text": "Attempt on Trump's life shakes a presidential election like no other\nWhen gunshots pierced the evening air at Donald Trump\u2019s rally in western Pennsylvania on Saturday night, they echoed generations of political violence in some of America\u2019s most troubling moments \u2014 giving terrifying, percussive emphasis to a chaotic 2024 presidential election that is unlike any in U.S. history.\n\nThe assassination attempt wrote a ghastly new chapter in the story of deepening division and American political polarization over the past decade. Intense us-versus-them rhetoric has climbed between liberals and conservatives as trust in reliable information sources has fallen, replaced by bad-faith actors on insufficiently moderated social media platforms. And unprecedented events shaking the nation\u2019s political system keep accumulating.\n\nSix weeks and one day before the shooting, Trump became the first former president convicted of a crime when a Manhattan jury found him guilty on all 34 felony counts related to falsifying business records to hide an alleged sexual encounter with a porn star so that he could help his political fortunes.\n\nIn between, Trump\u2019s late-June debate with President Joe Biden left the incumbent so politically damaged that some members of his own party have called on him to abandon his pending nomination. The Supreme Court granted Trump \u2014 and future presidents \u2014 broad immunity from prosecution for acts undertaken while in office.\n\nAnd now Trump, on the precipice of officially accepting his third consecutive Republican nomination at next week\u2019s GOP convention, has survived an assassination attempt. It\u2019s the first time a president or presidential candidate has been wounded by a would-be assassin in more than four decades, since President Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981.\n\nFour presidents \u2014 Abraham Lincoln, James Garfield, William McKinley and John F. Kennedy \u2014 were killed by assassins\u2019 bullets. Kennedy\u2019s brother, Robert F. Kennedy, was killed as he campaigned for the Democratic nomination in 1968, and George Wallace, the segregationist Alabama governor, was paralyzed by a would-be assassin while he was on the campaign trail in 1972. In 1981, Reagan, little more than two months into his presidency, was shot and badly wounded outside a Washington hotel.Americans reacted to each by coming together in shock and grief \u2014 and without any clear pattern of political implications beyond that. Now, it is not yet clear how the shooting will affect the outcome of the Trump-Biden rematch. But it has jolted a nation and disrupted a race that has long been viewed as static.\n\nTrump, who pumped a defiant fist in the air with blood streaked across his face in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, said on social media Saturday night that a bullet had struck his ear.\n\nRepublicans quickly rallied to Trump in statements, social media posts and television appearances, suggesting an acceleration of the unification that typically occurs within a political party around its national convention. Many of Trump\u2019s most loyal supporters declared themselves energized by the failed attempt on his life.\n\nAt the same time, the attack has interrupted and overshadowed everything else happening in the 2024 campaign \u2014 including the more than two weeks of blistering criticism Biden has been taking from fellow Democrats who were alarmed by his debate performance and unsatisfied by his efforts to clean up the mess.\n\nBoth campaigns advised their staffs Saturday night not to make public comments about the attempt on the former president\u2019s life, but some Trump allies began casting blame on Biden.\n\n\u201cThe central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs,\u201d said Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, who is a potential vice presidential pick for Trump. \u201cThat rhetoric led directly to President Trump\u2019s attempted assassination.\u201d\n\nDemocrats, who have long held Trump responsible for rhetoric they say incited the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol, pushed back on that messaging.\n\nA Biden aide pointed to \u201cthe continual comments the president has made condemning political violence and saying it can never happen, before and during\u201d his administration.\n\nPeople sit in a bar Saturday near Fiserv Forum watching news ahead of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. Matt Rourke / AP\n\nBiden, Democratic leaders and most Republican leaders called for civility in the wake of the shooting. \u201cThe idea that there\u2019s political violence, or violence in America like this, is just unheard of,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not appropriate. I mean, everybody, everybody must condemn it.\u201d\n\nAnd yet an alarming number of presidents and candidates have been targets of assassination attempts, shaking American elections and democracy itself along the way.\n\nIn all, according to the Congressional Research Service, there were 15 attempted assassinations of presidents, presidents-elect and presidential candidates through 2008.\n\n\u201cPolitical violence is unacceptable,\u201d Jack Schlossberg, grandson of John F. Kennedy, wrote on X. \u201cBut it\u2019s part of our history.\u201d\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., who is seeking the presidency this year as an independent candidate, has asked the Biden administration to provide Secret Service protection and has so far been denied a protective detail. Asked about that in an interview with News Nation, he declined to press his case and instead called for lowering the temperature in American politics.\n\n\u201cI was with my dad when he died in Los Angeles,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cI understand the implications that this has for our country.\u201d\n\nLess clear are the implications for the November election.",

        "text": "Trump assassination attempt upends 2024 election\nTragedy at Trump rally upends election campaign - for now\n\nAP Donald Trump pumps his fist in the air, moments after an assassination attempt on him\n\nThe 2024 election campaign has a new iconic image: Donald Trump, moments after narrowly avoiding serious injury or death from an assassin\u2019s bullets, standing with his fist raised, lines of blood streaked across his face, an American flag billowing in the breeze behind him. \u201cFight! Fight! Fight!\u201d the former president said, as some of the supporters, who moments before had feared for their lives, began cheering. The bloodshed in Pennsylvania will leave a lasting mark on the American psyche, puncturing the veneer of security around the highest levels of presidential politics \u2013 of magnetic screening, bulletproof limousines and heavily armed Secret Service agents. Even former presidents are not insulated from the violence that can erupt in everyday American life. It was also a dramatic moment in American political history; one that is sure to be replayed in video clips, still photographs and testimonial accounts throughout the course of this presidential campaign and in campaigns to come. In a rare address from the Oval Office Sunday evening, President Joe Biden called on Americans to cool the temperature around political debate. \"[It] must never be a battlefield and, God forbid, a killing field,\" he warned. \"No matter how strong our convictions, we must never descend into violence.\"\n\nNo place in America for this kind of violence - Biden\n\nThe attack has already begun coursing through America's partisan dialogue, as numerous Republicans have spoken out to condemn President Biden and the Democrats for creating a rhetorical environment conducive to the violence. They point to dire warnings about the former president becoming a dictator and threatening democracy as examples of the overheated language that could inspire an assassin. In particular, they highlight leaked comments the president made in private to donors just last week about increasing the attacks on the former president\u2019s record and putting a \u201cbull\u2019s-eye\u201d on him. \u201cThey've tried to take him out in so many other ways, financially, they've tried to throw him in jail,\u201d Donald Trump Jr said in a television interview on Sunday. \u201cIt's almost as if they would love for this to happen.\u201d\n\nAt least so far, however, the motives and political affiliations of the alleged assassin, 20-year-old Pennsylvania resident Thomas Matthew Crooks, are in doubt. They may ultimately defy an easy partisan narrative. The former president\u2019s oldest son went on to add that, after the assassination attempt, those on the left can no longer accuse the former president of culpability for the 6 January attack on the US Capitol. That violent episode took place hours after the then-president had held a rally just a few dozen blocks away, challenging the 2020 election results. His actions on that day led to his impeachment by the House of Representatives and, more than a year later, indictment by a special counsel appointed by the US attorney general. If the Pennsylvania shooting defuses this line of criticism by Democrats, it\u2019s just one way in which it will have fundamentally reshaped this presidential campaign. Others may become clear over the course of the Republican National Convention, which starts on Monday in Milwaukee. The failed attack on the former president plays into several themes the Trump campaign was already planning for the quadrennial gathering, which culminates with Trump taking the stage to accept his party\u2019s nomination on Thursday night. The first is that it could provide a boost to the politics of grievance and persecution that have been a central focus of his rally speeches and social media posts. \u201cThey\u2019re not really after me; they\u2019re after you,\u201d is a common Trump refrain, on t-shirts, billboards and car stickers. \u201cI\u2019m just in the way.\u201d That message will land with new force after the former president and his crowd of supporters were sprayed with bullets. Trump\u2019s legions of fans \u2013 many of whose support borders on near-messianic hero-worship - will have all the more reason to identify with a man who almost lost his life while standing before them.\n\nGetty Images Supporters of former US President Donald Trump wait for the start of a campaign rally\n\nThe former president\u2019s brush with death, and subsequent acts of bloody defiance, will also fit with the contrast Trump campaign officials have said they are trying to draw at this week\u2019s convention \u2013 one where their candidate, and party, embody rugged masculinity and strength, while their opponents are feeble. President Biden\u2019s age and capabilities have dogged his campaign for months \u2013 and prompted a Democratic crisis of confidence in his re-election effort after a stunningly poor performance at the presidential debate just over two weeks ago. Saturday night\u2019s attack, and Trump\u2019s response to it, will allow Republicans to put that contrast in stark relief in the days ahead. Democrats have spent the past two weeks in anguished soul-searching over their president\u2019s political future. Now, they have a new set of concerns. In a way, the assassination attempt may end up providing a political lifeline to Mr Biden, given that the focus has dramatically shifted away from his age-related struggles and internal attempts to oust him. But the president\u2019s re-election strategy \u2013 which hinges on painting Trump as a danger to the nation if he again becomes president \u2013 could be seriously hampered if the American public is hostile to new, pointed criticisms of the man.\n\nWatch now on iPlayer Trump Assassination Attempt: What Happened?",

First, he has rejected calls to pull out of the race for the White House and has declared defiantly that he may not be as young and energetic as before, but he knows how to deliver as the president of the country. Secondly, he has targeted Republican contender Donald Trump , saying that he is in a worse condition and he will take the country along the wrong path if he wins the election.Shortly after his gaffe at the NATO event , where he called Ukrainian President Volodymir Zelensky as 'Vladimir Putin', three more Democrat leaders, including Representative Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, urged him to quit the race.Soon after this, Joe Biden made another gaffe, this time at a press conference where he called Vice President Kamala Harris as 'Donald Trump'. According to 'Bloomberg', House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries met the president the same evening and \u201cdirectly expressed the full breadth of insight, heartfelt perspectives, and conclusions about the path forward.\u201dWorking on the second part of his strategy, Biden tried to shift the focus to Trump and prove that despite his own missteps, the republic contender's rhetoric and policies are much worse.Representative Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, came out in his support and declared that he remains \u201call in\u201d with Biden. He targeted Trump and said that his return to power would not augur well.

        "text": "What does the Trump rally attack mean for the US election?\nAn already unprecedented race has again been transformed by political violence that is set to loom over the months ahead.\n\nWashington, DC \u2013 Eight gunshots have transformed the United States election, casting an already unprecedented race into further uncertainty.\n\nOn Sunday, a day after the attack at candidate Donald Trump\u2019s Butler, Pennsylvania rally, details have continued to emerge, as have early indications of how the violent act would affect US political discourse, campaigning and voter attitudes in the days leading up to the November 5 poll.\n\nBut for Rina Shah, a US political strategist, one thing was clear in the immediate wake of the attack: \u201cNo matter what, everything changes from here on out.\u201d\n\nThat will be particularly on display, she said, at the Republican National Convention (RNC) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where Republicans will gather starting Monday to begin the official process of nominating Trump as their candidate.\n\nThe event will kick off just two days after the suspect, identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, opened fire from a nearby rooftop outside of the Secret Service security perimeter at Trump\u2019s rally.\n\nOne bullet grazed Trump in the right ear, causing panic on the crowded stage. Others struck spectators, killing one man and injuring two more.\n\n\u201cI can say that this shocks the consciousness,\u201d Shah said during a television interview with Al Jazeera. \u201cWe have less than 120 days to go and this resets everything.\u201d\n\nCalls for unity meet accusations and blame\n\nIndeed, the rally attack \u2013 in which Trump became the 13th US president or presidential candidate to face an assassination attempt, and the eighth to survive \u2013 was swiftly met with calls from elected lawmakers for a reset in the polarisation that has come to define modern US politics.\n\nPresident Joe Biden decried the violence as \u201csick\u201d before holding a phone call with his opponent late on Saturday. He said \u201ceverybody must condemn\u201d the attack.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump, in a break from the often caustic rhetoric that had previously defined his campaign, said, \u201cIt is more important than ever that we stand united.\u201d\n\nPolitical violence experts have said it is imperative for leaders to continue to bring the temperature down to prevent further violence or retributive attacks.\n\nSpeaking to Al Jazeera in a TV interview after the attack, Colin P Clarke, the director of research at the Soufan Group, a security consulting firm, said the rally violence \u201cepitomises\u201d the current extremes of US democracy.\n\nRecent studies have shown that while Americans are less ideologically polarised than they perceive themselves to be, they are increasingly \u201cemotionally polarised\u201d, meaning they \u201charbour strong dislike for members of the other party\u201d, according to an analysis published last year by Rachel Kleinfeld, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nSeveral studies have shown an increase in threats against elected officials and public office holders in recent years, surging after Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol in an effort to overturn Biden\u2019s election victory on January 6, 2021.\n\nMeanwhile, a June survey conducted out of the University of Chicago found that nearly 7 percent of respondents said the use of force was justified to restore Trump to the presidency. Another 10 percent said the use of force would be justified to \u201cprevent Trump from becoming president\u201d.\n\nSecurity analyst Clarke added that while the violence at the Trump rally could be a unifying moment for Americans, \u201cit\u2019s likely to be divisive\u201d. He predicted a \u201cvery dangerous political season\u201d.\n\nHis words have since proven prescient, with many Republicans, including Trump\u2019s possible vice president pick, Senator JD Vance, laying blame for the attack on Biden. Vance said Biden\u2019s rhetoric has portrayed Trump as \u201can authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs\u201d.\n\nAt least one Republican legislator has dipped into conspiracy theory, with US Representative Mike Collins of Georgia baselessly calling on authorities to arrest Biden for \u201cinciting an assassination\u201d.\n\nPolitical bump\n\nAs politics watchers wait to see if the shooting will indeed inflame or soothe US political polarisation, almost every analyst who spoke to Al Jazeera agreed that Trump is likely to receive a bump in support in the wake of the attack.\n\nThat will be buoyed by the timing of the incident, just before the RNC, with Trump\u2019s team saying he will still attend.\n\nIt will also be boosted by the images and the narrative that have emerged from the attack.\n\n\u201cThe iconic shot of Trump standing with his fist in the air, blood coming down the side of his head, and the flag draped just perfectly over him is really driving the narrative,\u201d James Davis, a Republican strategist, told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to be seen sympathetically after this from the national narrative,\u201d he said.\n\nHe'll never stop fighting to Save America \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 pic.twitter.com/qT4Vd0sVTm \u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) July 13, 2024\n\nEven a slight boost in support could make the difference in a race set to be decided by razor-thin margins. Trump and Biden have been hoping to win over a small group of undecided voters in a few key battleground states while turning out voters who do not normally go to the polls.\n\nTrump has largely weathered his historic May conviction on charges related to hush-money payments made to an adult film actress, although some polls had shown some softening among undecided voters. Biden, meanwhile, has faced growing calls from within his party to step aside as concerns over his age have crescendoed.\n\nStill, a Bloomberg/Morning Consult poll released last week showed Biden leading Trump slightly in Michigan and Wisconsin, and Trump with a slight lead in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina.\n\nSpectre of more violence\n\nSpeaking to Al Jazeera, Arshad Hasan, a Democratic strategist, also acknowledged that Trump is likely to gain in the wake of the attack, particularly with the Biden campaign promising to pause communications and advertisements critical of Trump for 48 hours out of respect.\n\nWhile Hasan said it is wise for Democrats to focus on \u201chumanity\u201d in the wake of the attack, they should also continue to make calls for greater gun control, which Biden had already made central to his presidency. \u201cThe time to talk about gun violence is whenever there is gun violence,\u201d he said.\n\nThe political strategist said he was attending a conference of the party\u2019s progressive wing when the attack occurred. He saw shock waves go through the crowd of attendees, many of whom would be spending the next months of the election on various campaign trails and at events similar to Trump\u2019s rally.\n\nBeyond the Trump attack, still fresh in many people\u2019s minds are the 2011 shooting of Representative Gabby Giffords at a constituent event and the 2017 attack on members of Congress playing baseball in Alexandria, Virginia, he added.\n\nThe campaign season, Hasan said, will likely be defined by that spectre of fear.\n\n\u201cThere are hundreds of people who are running for Congress, for Senate, thousands of people running for state legislature. And on top of that, there\u2019s all of the issues that people are advocating for,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the attack has led to a reassessment of campaign security for high-profile candidates, most people running for election do so with little to no security.\n\n\u201cThere is this fear that violence begets more violence,\u201d Hasan said.",

AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar\n\nThe assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania Saturday night will loom large over the Republican National Convention that kicks off on Monday in Milwaukee, a Northeastern political expert says.\n\nRepublicans will leverage the shooting over the four-day event, and try to capitalize on Trump\u2019s lead and cast him as a sympathetic figure and \u201cfighter of oppressive forces,\u201d says Nick Beauchamp, associate professor of political science at Northeastern University.\n\n\u201cI think from the Republicans\u2019 side of things, because they see themselves as ahead at the moment, they have a very strong incentive to not rock the boat,\u201d says Beauchamp.\n\n\u201cThey have an incentive now to do the same thing that the Biden team is doing, which is carefully going through their speeches to make sure there are no implicit calls for violence,\u201d he adds. \u201cThey want to portray themselves as the victims.\u201d\n\nTrump will accept his party\u2019s presidential nomination at the convention.\n\nGunshots went off just a few minutes as Trump was speaking at a campaign event in Butler, Pennsylvania, Saturday. Trump reached for his right ear after the shots were fired and the Secret Service immediately surrounded him as he went to the ground.\n\nBefore he was escorted off the stage by the Secret Service, Trump pumped his fist and shouted out to the crowd, blood dripping from his ear and visible on his face.\n\nWho was the suspected shooter?\n\nThe alleged shooter was killed; and one attendee died and two others critically injured. The suspected shooter fired from \u201can elevated position outside of the rally venue,\u201d the Secret Service said, and used an AR-15 style rifle.\n\nIn a statement early Sunday, the FBI said it had identified the suspected shooter as Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year old man from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania.\n\nCrooks was a registered Republican, though in 2021 at the age of 17 he donated $15 to ActBlue, a politician fundraising platform \u201cfor serving left-leaning and Democratic nonprofits and politicians,\u201d according to the organization\u2019s website.\n\nAuthorities said they found explosives in Crook\u2019s vehicle, which was parked near the rally, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nPhotos of the president taken while he was pumping his fist after the shooting are being posted on social media, and being printed on merchandise, such as T-shirts and coffee mugs.\n\nIncident won\u2019t sway anti-Trumpers\n\nBeauchamp says the incident will embolden Trump\u2019s base, but it will not significantly sway the opinions of those who oppose the president and his policies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear the Trump supporters are going to be enthused about this, just as they were enthused by his mug shot and the trial itself, which was seen as the underdog fighting the system,\u201d Beauchamp says. \u201cThere is hardly anything more exemplary of that than the photo, even though of course, we don\u2019t know [much] about the shooter at the moment.\u201d\n\nWhat about swing voters?\n\nBeauchamp isn\u2019t convinced it could significantly change their views, or have a significant impact on the polls.\n\n\u201cIn a sense, this is already playing up to Trump\u2019s pre-existing image as a fighter against oppressive forces,\u201d he says. \u201cIt seems unlikely that is going to win them over, particularly a few days after things have gone by.\u201d\n\nMisinformation in the aftermath\n\nDavid Lazer, a distinguished professor of political science and computer/information science at Northeastern, says in the past few days there has been a large swath of misinformation being shared online.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve certainly seen that in aces just from peeking at social media,\u201d he says.\n\nCostas Panagopoulos, Northeastern University distinguished professor of political science, said the incident is a reminder that \u201cthere is no place for political violence in our country, and also of just how divided the country is along partisan and ideological lines.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn America, we don\u2019t solve our political problems using violence,\u201d Panagopoulos said. \u201cWe do so at the polling booth.\u201d\n\nPolitically, the shooting could potentially be damaging for Trump \u201cbecause many believe he has stoked the fires of political violence and division for political advantage, exacerbating polarization in America with incendiary rhetoric,\u201d Panagopoulos said.\n\nThe incident could also \u201cengender sympathy for Trump, who is clearly as vulnerable to political violence and extremism as anyone,\u201d he continued.\n\nNortheastern Global News, in your inbox. Sign up for NGN\u2019s daily newsletter for news, discovery and analysis from around the world.\n\nShooting should be condemned by all\n\nJeremy Paul, a Northeastern University law professor, says the shooting was \u201cshocking and should be condemned by people from every possible political party and political perspective.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the bottom line, the person who engaged in this shooting was very well aware that what he was doing was against the law,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIf there is going to be any legal implications immediately it will be on gun safety legislation, and whether some of members of Congress who have opposed any gun safety legislation might be moved by this attack to change their minds,\u201d he says.\n\nJames Alan Fox, a Northeastern University professor of criminology, law and public policy, said the incident \u201cwill put gun violence as a major issue in [Trump\u2019s] campaign.\u201d\n\nFox, who presides over the Associated Press/USA TODAY/Northeastern University Mass Killings Database, the longest-running and most extensive data source on the subject, said he thinks the incident should make gun control a major campaign issue.\n\nPresident Joe Biden addressed the country in the aftermath, strongly condemning \u201cpolitical violence.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone must condemn it \u2014 everyone,\u201d Biden said.",

        "text": "Snap Insight: Trump assassination attempt may have just won him the US presidential election\nBUSAN: In a shocking moment, even for American politics, a gunman tried to assassinate former United States president Donald Trump at a political rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday (Jul 13). It left one attendee dead, two injured and Trump slightly wounded.\n\nThis may be the moment remembered for winning Trump the presidential election in November. The image of Trump emerging, fist in the air, blood on his face, could well seal the deal.\n\nThe shooter, now identified as 20-year-old Thomas Crooks, appears to be a registered Republican who wore a T-shirt for a right-wing gun website. This casts doubt on an ideological explanation for the shooting. At the moment, this does not appear to be left-wing terrorism against the former president.\n\nThe good news is that US political assassination attempts are rarely conspiracies or coups d\u2019etat. Attempts - such as those of John F Kennedy in 1963 and Ronald Reagan in 1981 - were committed by mentally disturbed loners.\n\nThere has been no follow-on political violence since yesterday. Trump will likely return to the campaign trail.",

This myopic view of immigration ignores the over one million international students studying in the US.

According to the 2023 Open Doors data , the number of international students enrolled in higher education institutions in the United States is rebounding from the COVID-19 dip.Today, international students make up nearly 6% of the US higher education population, numbering over 1,000,000 individuals. This raw number has not yet hit the high water mark of the 2018-19 school year, but has been increasing since 2021-22 when nation-state borders reopened and COVID-19 vaccines were more readily available worldwide.International students enrolled in US higher education institutions bring with them distinct perspectives, experiences and languages. Additionally, the majority of these students bring economic power through their willingness to pay full or nearly full fees for their education.If international prospective students and their families determine that the US is not the best destination for them, it could have profound implications for the sector.Higher education institutions are already struggling in the wake of what economics professor Nathan Grawe refers to as the demographic cliff and problems with the new Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form which have decreased completion rates by nearly 30% in 2023-24 and suggest a likely decline in domestic college-going students.While international students are, at times, categorically different from immigrants, previous rhetoric related to bans and xenophobia have negatively impacted enrolment at US higher education institutions.In the lead-up to the 2024 presidential election, it is important to understand the major candidates\u2019 rhetoric regarding immigration in order to prepare and respond to policies in the international higher education sector.Prior to the first US presidential debate in June 2024, former president Donald Trump proposed, in an off-hand comment, a policy change that would allow all F-1 visa holders graduating from US colleges and universities to receive green cards, according to the New York Times . This policy prescription would be a monumental change from Trump\u2019s previous immigration policies which focused on mass deportations.While the Trump campaign has already withdrawn this proposal, the mass implementation of green cards would have allowed F-1 visa holders not to be beholden to finite Optional Practical Training regulations, making their status in the US after graduation less fraught.If this policy were to be implemented, there would be immense pressure on institutional and federal bodies to process green cards in a timely manner \u2013 and probably an explosion of applications to be evaluated by admissions and financial aid professionals.This outcome would significantly bog down systems that are already pressed to process increasing numbers of applications year over year, but would simultaneously have positive outcomes for international students. Trump\u2019s official platforms for the 2024 election say two things related to immigration, neither of which are positively framed for international audiences.First, the platform states that his administration will secure borders and reclaim national sovereignty. As in 2016, Trump suggests a solution of mass deportation and that non-US citizens are a burden for institutions.This rhetoric does not present the US as a safe or welcoming place.Trump\u2019s platform also wants to explicitly reject globalism. This section of his platform specifically calls out China as a rival. Future anti-China policy prescriptions would have detrimental effects on higher education enrolment, given that over 27% of international students in the US have China as their country of origin.Explicit anti-China and nationalistic rhetoric will have immediate negative consequences on US higher education institutions\u2019 international student matriculation. President Joe Biden\u2019s platforms do not explicitly include immigration. Nor does his official site mention any immigration-related accomplishments during these nearly four years of his presidency.This is an extreme oversight and seemingly suggests that he and his administration are comfortable with the status quo and are not intent on either deterring or welcoming immigrants to the US or to higher education institutions.On 4 June 2024 the Biden administration announced new actions to secure the border.While Biden continues to refer to the immigration system as \u201cbroken\u201d, he is most often referring to the US southern border with Mexico. This myopic view of immigration ignores the over one million international students studying in the US. Ignoring this population does not engender rapport or support globally, or within internationalisation contexts.Similarly, on 18 June 2024 the Biden administration announced new actions to keep families together.This announcement directly relates to people with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) status, which would not impact international student populations, and is limited to US citizens with non-citizen spouses and children and is not available for individuals. This signals both a preference for domestic policy and for the family unit.Because Biden includes nothing related to internationalisation, globalisation or international partnerships on his official platform, he is missing the opportunity to promote goodwill and soft power through tertiary education.Finally, during the 27 June presidential debate , the word \u2018education\u2019 was mentioned just once in relation to Biden\u2019s work with Pell Grants. The word \u2018immigration\u2019 was mentioned three times, all by moderator Jake Tapper. \u2018China\u2019, however, was mentioned 13 times and none of them positively by either candidate.If the rhetoric towards China continues to be one of contempt, US higher education institutions must be prepared for dramatic changes to applicant pools and patterns, for a shift in their English as a second language programming and for a drastically different economic funnel if prospective students and families from China determine that the Sinophobic rhetoric is a deterrent.Ultimately, the only pro-internationalisation rhetoric or policy prescription related to international students at higher education institutions in the US came from former president Trump but was soundly revoked just hours later by his campaign\u2019s press secretary.Both major candidates in the 2024 US presidential election are taking a stance that is nationalistic, exclusionary, isolationist and unwelcoming for prospective international students, especially those from China.If this rhetoric comes to fruition, it portends drastic and detrimental consequences for the US higher education sector just as it starts to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and is already struggling against a domestic demographic cliff.University World News.\n\nReceive email updates from UWN\n\n\n\nGlobal newsletters Africa newsletters Other\n\n(other includes related events and webinars)\n\n\n\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions Global newslettersAfrica newslettersOther",

        "text": "A look at past presidential assassination attempts in American history\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Before Saturday\u2019s apparent attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, there have been multiple instances of political violence targeting U.S. presidents, former presidents and major party presidential candidates.\n\nREAD MORE: 5 things to know about the Trump rally shooting\n\nA look at some of the assassinations and attempted assassinations that have occurred since the nation\u2019s founding in 1776:\n\nAbraham Lincoln, the 16th president\n\nLincoln was the first president to be assassinated, shot by John Wilkes Booth on April 14, 1865, as he and his wife, Mary Todd Lincoln, attended a special performance of the comedy \u201cOur American Cousin\u201d at Ford\u2019s Theatre in Washington.\n\nLincoln was taken to a house across the street from the theater for medical treatment after he was shot in the back of the head. He died the next morning. His support for Black rights has been cited as a motive behind his killing.\n\nTwo years before the assassination, during the Civil War, which was fought over slavery, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation granting freedom to slaves within the Confederacy.\n\nLincoln was succeeded by Vice President Andrew Johnson.\n\nBooth was shot and killed on April 26, 1865, after he was found hiding in a barn near Bowling Green, Virginia.\n\nJames Garfield, the 20th president\n\nGarfield was the second president to be assassinated, six months after taking office. He was walking through a train station in Washington on July 2, 1881, to catch a train to New England when he was shot by Charles Guiteau.\n\nAlexander Graham Bell, the telephone inventor, tried unsuccessfully to find the bullet lodged in Garfield\u2019s chest using a device he designed specifically for the president. The mortally wounded president lay at the White House for several weeks but died in September after he was taken to the New Jersey shore. He had held office for six months.\n\nGarfield was succeeded by Vice President Chester Arthur.\n\nGuiteau was found guilty and executed in June 1882.\n\nWilliam McKinley, the 25th president\n\nMcKinley was shot after giving a speech in Buffalo, New York, on Sept. 6, 1901. He was shaking hands with people passing through a receiving line when a man fired two shots into his chest at point-blank range. Doctors had expected McKinley to recover but gangrene then set in around the bullet wounds.\n\nMcKinley died on Sept. 14, 1901, six months after opening his second term.\n\nHe was succeeded by Vice President Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nLeon F. Czolgosz, an unemployed, 28-year-old Detroit resident, admitted to the shooting. Czolgosz was found guilty at trial and put to death in the electric chair on Oct. 29, 1901.\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt, the 32nd president\n\nRoosevelt, at the time the president-elect, had just given a speech in Miami from the back of an open car when gunshots rang out.\n\nRoosevelt was not injured in the February 1933 shooting that killed Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak.\n\nGuiseppe Zangara was convicted in the shooting and sentenced to death.\n\nHarry S. Truman, the 33rd president\n\nTruman was staying at Blair House, across the street from the White House, in November 1950 when two gunmen broke in.\n\nTruman was not injured, but a White House policeman and one of the assailants were killed in an exchange of gunfire. Two other White House policemen were wounded.\n\nOscar Callazo was arrested and sentenced to death. In 1952, Truman commuted the sentence to life in prison. He was released from prison in 1979 by President Jimmy Carter.\n\nJohn F. Kennedy, the 35th president\n\nKennedy was fatally shot by a hidden assassin armed with a high-powered rifle as he visited Dallas in November 1963 with first lady Jacqueline Kennedy. Shots rang out as the president\u2019s motorcade rolled through Dealey Plaza in downtown Dallas.\n\nKennedy was rushed to Parkland Memorial Hospital, where he died soon after.\n\nHe was succeeded by Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, who was sworn into office in a conference room aboard Air Force One. He is the only president to take the oath of office on an airplane.\n\nHours after the assassination, police arrested Lee Harvey Oswald after finding a sniper\u2019s perch in a nearby building, the Texas School Book Depository.\n\nTwo days later, Oswald was being taken from police headquarters to the county jail when Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby rushed forward and fatally shot Oswald.\n\nGerald Ford, the 38th president\n\nFord faced two assassination attempts within weeks in 1975 and was not hurt in either incident.\n\nIn the first attempt, Ford was on his way to a meeting with California\u2019s governor in Sacramento when Charles Manson disciple Lynette \u201cSqueaky\u201d Fromme pushed through a crowd on the street, drew a semi-automatic pistol and pointed it at Ford. The gun wasn\u2019t fired.\n\nFromme was sentenced to prison and released in 2009.\n\nIt was 17 days later when another woman, Sara Jane Moore, confronted Ford outside a hotel in San Francisco. Moore fired one shot and missed. A bystander grabbed her arm as a second shot was attempted.\n\nMoore was sent to prison and released in 2007.\n\nRonald Reagan, the 40th president\n\nReagan was leaving a speech in Washington, D.C., and walking to his motorcade when he was shot by John Hinckley Jr., who was in the crowd.\n\nReagan recovered from the March 1981 shooting. Three other people were shot, including his press secretary, James Brady, who was partially paralyzed as a result.\n\nHinckley was arrested and confined to a mental hospital after a jury found him not guilty by reason of insanity in shooting Reagan. In 2022, Hinckley was freed from court oversight after a judge determined he was \u201cno longer a danger to himself or others.\u201d\n\nGeorge W. Bush, the 43rd president\n\nBush was attending a rally in Tbilisi in 2005 with Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili when a hand grenade was thrown toward him.\n\nBoth men were behind a bulletproof barrier when the grenade, wrapped in cloth, landed about 100 feet away. The grenade did not explode, and no one was hurt.\n\nVladimir Arutyunian was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt, presidential candidate\n\nThe former president was shot in Milwaukee in 1912 while campaigning to return to the White House.\n\nRoosevelt had previously served two terms as president and was running again as a third-party candidate.\n\nFolded papers and a metal glasses case in Roosevelt\u2019s pocket apparently blunted the bullet\u2019s impact and he was not seriously hurt.\n\nJohn Schrank was arrested and spent the remainder of his life in mental hospitals.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy, presidential candidate\n\nKennedy was seeking the Democratic presidential nomination when he was killed at a Los Angeles hotel \u2014 moments after giving his victory speech for winning the 1968 California primary.\n\nKennedy was a U.S. senator from New York and the brother of President John F. Kennedy, who was assassinated five years earlier.\n\nFive other people were wounded in the shooting.\n\nSirhan Sirhan was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. That was commuted to life in prison, where Sirhan remains after his latest petition for release was denied last year.\n\nGeorge C. Wallace, presidential candidate\n\nWallace was seeking the Democratic presidential nomination when he was shot during a campaign stop in Maryland in 1972, an incident that left him paralyzed from the waist down.\n\nWallace, the governor of Alabama, was known for his segregationist views, which he later renounced.\n\nArthur Bremer was convicted in the shooting and sentenced to prison. He was released in 2007.",

        "text": "Bernie Sanders backs Biden and urges Democrats to \u2018stop the bickering\u2019\nBernie Sanders has offered his backing to Joe Biden, dismissing calls for the man he described as the \u201cmost effective president in the modern history of our country\u201d to stand down in the upcoming US presidential election.\n\nSanders, the totemic progressive US senator, used an opinion piece in the New York Times to endorse Biden, who has come under increasing fire from fellow Democrats over his ability to beat Donald Trump following a disastrous televised debate between the two.\n\n\u201cDespite my disagreements with him on particular issues, he has been the most effective president in the modern history of our country and is the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump \u2013 a demagogue and pathological liar,\u201d Sanders wrote.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to learn a lesson from the progressive and centrist forces in France who, despite profound political differences, came together this week to soundly defeat rightwing extremism.\u201d\n\nSanders joins Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, another key figure on the left of the Democratic party, in voicing support for Biden, even as upwards of 20 elected Democrats have called for him to step down, citing his apparent frailty during the debate and his tough re-election prospects against Trump.\n\nSo far, the only Democratic senator to call for Biden to stand down is Peter Welch who, like Sanders, an independent who largely votes with the Democrats, represents Vermont.\n\nDemocrats that have joined a \u201ccircular firing squad\u201d need to \u201cstop the bickering and nit-picking\u201d over Biden\u2019s performance, Sanders wrote, and start focusing on Trump\u2019s far greater problems, such as the former president\u2019s felony convictions, him being found liable in a sexual abuse case, his bankruptcies, and what Sanders called \u201cthousands of documented lies and falsehoods\u201d.\n\n\u201cI know: Mr Biden is old, is prone to gaffes, walks stiffly and had a disastrous debate with Mr Trump,\u201d Sanders wrote. \u201cBut this I also know: a presidential election is not an entertainment contest.\n\n\u201cEnough! Mr Biden may not be the ideal candidate, but he will be the candidate and should be the candidate.\u201d\n\nBiden has insisted he will not drop out of November\u2019s presidential election, despite polls showing he is either trailing or level with Trump. Biden said he made a \u201cstupid mistake\u201d of being extremely busy before the debate, including tiring international trips.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Trump been?\u201d the president said of his rival. \u201cRiding around on his golf cart? Filling out his scorecard before he hits the ball?\u201d\n\nThe speculation over the future of the 81-year-old president\u2019s future has prompted Trump, and his Republican allies, to turn their fire somewhat on Kamala Harris, the vice-president who is considered the most likely replacement for Biden. Trump unveiled a new, derisive nickname for the vice-president, \u201cLaffin\u2019 Kamala\u201d, which he tested at a campaign rally in Florida this week.",

        "text": "Conservative groups are pushing to clean voter rolls. Others see an effort to sow election distrust\nConservative groups are systematically attempting to challenge the legitimacy of large numbers of voter registrations across the country before the presidential election.\n\nThe strategy is part of a wider effort raising questions about the integrity of this year\u2019s election as former President Donald Trump repeatedly claims without evidence that his opponents are trying to cheat.\n\nThe voter roll tactics include mass door-knocking campaigns, using special software designed to identify voters whose eligibility could be challenged and a crush of lawsuits. Some of those have been brought by the Republican National Committee, which hosts the GOP\u2019s national convention this coming week.\n\nSeveral Republican secretaries of state are combing through voter lists on their own, including in Ohio and Tennessee, or to comply with aggressive new state voting laws.\n\nThose behind the reviews cast them as good government endeavors intended to help local election offices clean up the rolls. Voting rights groups and Democrats believe the effort aims to shake faith in the results of the 2024 election and lay the legal groundwork to challenge the results.\n\nHere is a look at what\u2019s happening around voter roll challenges:\n\nStates already must maintain their rolls\n\n\u201cSoles to the Rolls\u201d in Michigan, whose name echoes the \u201cSouls to the Polls\u201d get-out-the-vote efforts of Black churches, and Nevada\u2019s Pigpen Project are among state-level initiatives in which volunteers are trying to find flaws in state voter rolls.\n\nTheir findings can sound ominous: dead people or non-U.S. citizens registered, or people listed at addresses where they no longer live, suggesting the potential for double-voting. Conservative activists identify the suspect records, then deliver them to local or state election offices for possible removal.\n\nMichigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, earlier this year told a suburban Detroit clerk to reinstate the registrations of about 1,000 people who had been removed through such an effort, after the purge was reported by The New York Times.\n\nAmy Cohen, executive director of the National Association of State Election Directors, said information from member states suggests the efforts are happening nationwide. She said many of the challenges ignore or misunderstand the complexity and legal requirements around maintaining voter rolls.\n\nThe National Voter Registration Act already requires states to take steps to maintain accurate and current voter registration lists. Just because someone finds an outdated registration doesn\u2019t mean election officials are unaware of it, Cohen said.\n\n\u201cVoter registration lists are living, breathing databases,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the challenge, because people move and die and change their names and just exist every single day, and when you get a list, you\u2019re purchasing a moment in time. Registration activities and voter registration list maintenance activities are happening on an ongoing basis.\u201d\n\nThe fight for voter data\n\nConservative groups behind the voter roll reviews have filed hundreds of public records requests across the country to gain access to voter files. In almost a quarter of states, the disputes have landed in the courts. One of their goals is to create public databases for anyone to search and question whether certain voters should be allowed on a state\u2019s rolls.\n\nThe Public Interest Legal Foundation, led by conservative attorney Cleta Mitchell, is behind challenges in Colorado, Hawaii, Michigan, Minnesota, South Carolina and Wisconsin. Mitchell is perhaps best known for participating in Trump\u2019s call asking Georgia\u2019s secretary of state to \u201cfind\u201d the votes he needed to win the state in 2020. Arizona, California, Maryland and Pennsylvania face lawsuits by other groups.\n\nIn Georgia, an Associated Press survey of the state\u2019s 40 largest counties found that more than 18,000 voters had been challenged over the past two years, even though local election offices had rejected most of them.\n\nMany of the volunteer groups have received encouragement to mine the voter lists at workshops led by MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, a Trump ally and leading voice promoting election conspiracy theories. They also sometimes employ tools such as EagleAI Network, a data-matching software program developed for Mitchell\u2019s Election Integrity Network that creates voter lists from change-of-address forms, criminal justice records and property tax data.\n\nThe Public Interest Legal Foundation also sued the Electronic Registration Information Center, a voluntary system in which states share data to maintain accurate voter lists. Its lawsuit sought access to information the member states had agreed to keep private when they joined.\n\nThe foundation\u2019s president and general counsel, J. Christian Adams, who previously worked in the Justice Department\u2019s Voting Section, said not a single eligible voter has been removed from the rolls as a result of his group\u2019s efforts. He called the movement\u2019s critics paranoid.\n\n\u201cFraud, I don\u2019t care about,\u201d he said. \u201cAccuracy is what I care about.\u201d He said correct voter lists are especially important in states that mail ballots to every registration on their lists.\n\nAt least nine Republican-led states have abandoned the voluntary network, known as ERIC, after it became embroiled in election conspiracy theories, weakening its ability to cross-check voter records across state lines. Supporters of the system noted the paradox of the Republican states leaving because it\u2019s the only national system that helps states identify voters who are not eligible to cast a ballot.\n\nCleaning the rolls or sowing distrust?\n\nThe Republican National Committee, newly reconstituted under Trump, also is involved in efforts to challenge voter rolls before the November election.\n\nMichigan\u2019s voter rolls have been targeted in numerous lawsuits over the past four years by the RNC and others. A Nevada lawsuit filed by the RNC in March alleges the state is violating the National Voter Registration Act by failing to keep voter registration records accurate and updated. RNC Chair Michael Whatley at the time cited the need for \u201cclean voter rolls.\u201d\n\nExperts say the federal law actually errs on the side of enfranchising voters. To prevent eligible voters from being disenrolled, it requires outdated records to remain in the system for some years after they\u2019re flagged as a potential concern. It\u2019s a technicality that can explain questions often raised by conservative groups, such as the number of voter registrations exceeding a jurisdiction\u2019s population.\n\nIt\u2019s like \u201ccomparing apples to orangutans,\u201d Nevada\u2019s Democratic attorney general said in faulting the data RNC cited in its analysis. In its brief, the Democratic National Committee cast the RNC lawsuits as building ammunition for a 2024 election challenge.\n\n\u201cThis lawsuit is little more than political theater, designed less to address any real (much less substantial) issue with Nevada\u2019s voter registration lists, than to sow public distrust in the security and integrity of our electoral systems,\u201d the filing said. \u201cIt is no more than a continuation of Republicans\u2019 2020 efforts to undermine public confidence in our elections.\u201d\n\nCasting suspicions on voting\n\nTrump ally Ken Blackwell, who leads election efforts at the America First Policy Institute, has said legitimate voters \u201crun the risk of having their hard-won right to vote diluted by unlawfully cast ballots\u201d if voter roll glitches aren\u2019t addressed.\n\nHowever, election law experts say the problem that such efforts aim to fix \u2014 ineligible voters casting ballots \u2014 remains exceptionally rare.\n\n\u201cWhy? Because it\u2019s common sense that one person voting when they\u2019re not eligible is not going to swing an election, and is going to expose himself to criminal penalties,\u201d said Alice Clapman, senior counsel with the Brennan Center for Justice\u2019s democracy program. \u201cSo, even if someone were inclined to do this, it\u2019s very high risk and very low reward.\u201d\n\nClapman said the disinformation around voter rolls is eroding trust in election officials, who already face pressure and threats, and is undermining faith in the \u201cproud civic activity\u201d of voting.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so insidious about it is voting used to be a unifying national activity,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s now become this object of suspicion, and that\u2019s really corrosive of our democracy.\u201d",

        "text": "\u2018One inch from a potential civil war\u2019 \u2013 near miss in Trump shooting is also a close call for American democracy\nWith an assassination attempt on Donald Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania on July 13, 2024, the U.S. experienced another violent episode in its increasingly polarized politics. Former President Trump, who\u2019s about to formally become the GOP nominee for president in the 2024 election, survived the attempted assassination when, initial reports said, a bullet grazed his ear. But one rally attendee was killed, more spectators were injured and the suspected gunman is also dead. The Conversation\u2019s politics editor, Naomi Schalit, spoke with University of Massachusetts, Lowell, scholar Arie Perliger after the event. Perliger offered insight from his study of political violence and assassinations. Given the stark political polarization in the U.S., Perliger said, \u201cit\u2019s not a surprise that eventually people engage in violence.\u201d\n\nSchalit: When you heard the news, what was the first thing you thought?\n\nPerliger: The first thing that I thought about is that we were basically one inch from a potential civil war. I think that if, indeed, Donald Trump would have suffered fatal injuries today, the level of violence that we witnessed so far will be nothing in comparison to what would have happened in the next couple of months. I think that would have unleashed a new level of anger, frustration, resentment, hostility that we haven\u2019t seen for many, many years in the U.S.\n\nThis assassination attempt, at least at this early stage, may validate a strong sense among many Trump supporters and many people on the far right that they are being delegitimized, that they are on the defensive and that there are efforts to basically prevent them from competing in the political process and prevent Trump from returning to the White House.\n\nWhat we\u2019ve just seen, for many of the people on the far right, fits very well into a narrative that they\u2019ve already been constructing and disseminating for the last few months.\n\nPolitical assassination attempts don\u2019t aim only to kill someone. They have a larger goal, don\u2019t they?\n\nIn many ways, assassination attempts bypass the long process of trying to downgrade and defeat political opponents, when there is a sense that even a long political struggle will not be sufficient. Many perpetrators see assassinations as a tool that will allow them to achieve their political objectives in a very quick, very effective way that doesn\u2019t demand a lot of resources or a lot of organization. If we are trying to connect it to what we\u2019ve seen today, I think that many people see Trump as a unicorn, as a unique entity, who in many ways really consumed the entire conservative movement. So by removing him, there\u2019s a sense that that will or may solve the problem.\n\nI think that the conservative movement changed dramatically since 2016, when Trump was first elected, and a lot of the characteristics of Trumpism are actually now fairly popular in different parts of the conservative movement. So even if Trump will decide to retire at some point, I don\u2019t think that Trumpism \u2013 as a set of populist ideas \u2013 will disappear from the GOP. But I can definitely understand why people who see that as a threat will feel that removing Trump can solve all the problems.\n\nIn a study of the causes and impacts of political assassination, you wrote that unless electoral processes can address \u201cthe most intense political grievances \u2026 electoral competition has the potential to instigate further violence, including the assassinations of political figures.\u201d Is that what you saw in this attempted assassination?\n\nDemocracy cannot work if the different parties, the different movements, are not willing to work together on some issues. Democracy works when multiple groups are willing to reach some kind of consensus through negotiations, to collaborate and to cooperate.\n\nWhat we\u2019ve seen in the last 17 years, basically since 2008 and the rise of the Tea Party movement, is that there\u2019s increasing polarization in the U.S. And the worst part of this polarization is that the American political system became dysfunctional in the sense that we are forcing out any politicians and policymakers who are interested in collaboration with the other side. That\u2019s one thing. Second, people delegitimize leaders who are willing to collaborate with the other side, hence, presenting them as individuals who betrayed their values and political party.\n\nThe third part is that people are delegitimizing their political rivals. They transform a political disagreement into a war in which there is no space for working together to address the challenges they agree are facing the nation.\n\nWhen you combine those three dynamics, you create basically a dysfunctional system where both sides are convinced that it\u2019s a zero-sum game, that it\u2019s the end of the country. It\u2019s the end of democracy if the other side wins.\n\nIf both sides are hammering into people again and again that losing an election is the end of the world, then it\u2019s not a surprise that eventually people are willing to take the law into their hands and to engage in violence.",

        "text": "Biden, Trump stress unity after rally shooting upends presidential race\nBiden says \u2018violence is never the answer\u2019 as Trump says Republican convention a chance to bring country together.\n\nUnited States President Joe Biden and his Republican challenger Donald Trump have called on Americans to put aside political divisions and come together after Trump narrowly survived an attempted assassination.\n\nIn a six-and-a-half-minute address from the Oval Office on Sunday night, Biden said political violence could not be normalised and that all Americans have a responsibility to \u201ccool it down\u201d when it comes to heated political rhetoric.\n\n\u201cWe cannot, we must not, go down this road in America. We\u2019ve travelled it before throughout our history,\u201d Biden said.\n\n\u201cViolence is never the answer.\u201d\n\nAcknowledging the sharp differences between Democrats and Republicans, Biden said he would continue to articulate his vision for the country ahead of November\u2019s presidential election but that political disagreements must always be settled at the ballot box.\n\n\u201cDisagreement is inevitable in American democracy. It\u2019s part of human nature. But politics must never be a literal battlefield, or, God forbid, a killing field,\u201d he said.\n\nBiden\u2019s primetime address came as the US absorbed the ramifications of the first attempted assassination to wound a current or former president since the shooting of Ronald Reagan in 1981.\n\nTrump was left with a bloodied face after a gunman on Saturday opened fire at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, striking the former president in the ear.\n\nCorey Comperatore, a 50-year-old former fire chief, was killed and several others were injured in the attack.\n\nInvestigators are still looking into the motives of the suspected shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, who was shot dead by authorities shortly after he opened fire on the rally.\n\nThe FBI has said it believes that Crooks, who was registered as a Republican but also donated money to a Democratic-aligned political action committee, acted alone and that it has yet to identify any association with a particular ideology.\n\nAcrimonious race\n\nThe attempted assassination has reshaped an acrimonious race that has seen each candidate portray the other as an existential threat, dramatically shifting focus away from weeks of commentary about Biden\u2019s age and fitness following a disastrous debate performance last month.\n\nBiden, who has cast Trump as a serious danger to US democracy, temporarily suspended television advertisements and political messaging in the wake of the attack.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, Biden told reporters at the White House that he had a \u201cshort but good conversation\u201d with Trump in a phone call after the attack.\n\n\u201cJill and I are keeping him and his family in our prayers. We also extend our deepest condolences to the family of the victim who was killed. He was a father, he was protecting his family from the bullets that were being fired,\u201d Biden said.\n\nTrump, who has accused Biden of threatening democracy and weaponising the justice system against him, on Sunday arrived in Milwaukee, Wisconsin ahead of the opening of the Republican National Convention, where he will be formally named the party\u2019s nominee later this week.\n\nIn an interview with the Washington Examiner on Sunday, Trump said that he would deliver a \u201cwhole different speech\u201d at the convention than the \u201chumdinger\u201d he had originally planned.\n\n\u201cThis is a chance to bring the whole country, even the whole world, together. The speech will be a lot different, a lot different than it would\u2019ve been two days ago,\u201d he told the newspaper.\n\nSpeaking about the attack, Trump also told the publication that \u201creality is just setting in\u201d.\n\n\u201cI rarely look away from the crowd. Had I not done that in that moment, well, we would not be talking today, would we?\u201d\n\nTrump also wrote earlier on his Truth Social platform that Americans should stand united and not let \u201cevil to win\u201d. He said he had decided to attend the convention as planned as \u201cI cannot allow a \u2018shooter,\u2019 or potential assassin, to force change to scheduling, or anything else\u201d.\n\nSome high-profile Trump allies have gone on the offensive since the attempted assassination, accusing Biden and the Democrats of creating the conditions for violence.\n\nJD Vance, an Ohio Senator who is considered a top contender to be Trump\u2019s running mate, accused the Biden campaign of portraying Trump as an \u201cauthoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat rhetoric led directly to President Trump\u2019s attempted assassination,\u201d Vance said in a post on X on Saturday.\n\nSome political analysts have suggested that the attack will bolster the likelihood of a Trump victory in November, particularly as it took place in Pennsylvania, a key swing state that is considered crucial to Biden\u2019s re-election hopes.\n\nPollster Frank Luntz said he expected Trump\u2019s vote share to increase by one or two percentage points.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine either Biden or any of the potential Democratic candidates delivering full-throated crowd-pleasing attacks on the former President now, taking away most of their ability to play the Trump card by labelling him a \u2018threat to democracy\u2019 when he just survived a real threat to democracy,\u201d Luntz said in a post on X on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe 2024 presidential election is now Trump\u2019s to lose.\u201d\n\nIn his address, Biden, who is trailing Trump in most polls, acknowledged that his record and policies would come under criticism at the convention as part of the normal democratic process.\n\n\u201cWe debate and disagree, we compare and contrast the character of the candidates, the records, the issues, the agenda, the vision for America. But in America, we resolve our differences at the ballot box,\u201d Biden said, pledging to continue to make the case for democracy and \u201caction at the ballot box\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how we do it, at the ballot box, not with bullets. The power to change America should always rest in the hands of the people, not in the hands of a would-be assassin.\u201d",

As a result, former President Trump, as the nominee of the Republican Party, will no longer be subject to the heightened suspension penalties,\u201d said Meta\u2019s Nick Clegg in an update to a previously posted statement from early 2023.\n\nIn 2021, Meta indefinitely suspended Trump\u2019s Facebook and Instagram accounts after he praised those who carried out violent attacks at the Capitol on January 6 that year. His suspended accounts were restored in 2023, but with what Facebook and Instagram-parent Meta called \u201cguardrails\u201d in place.\n\n(For top technology news of the day, subscribe to our tech newsletter Today\u2019s Cache)\n\nHowever, the latest update allows Trump more flexibility than he has had for years, in the interest of allowing him to be heard as a politician possibly running for the U.S. presidency.\n\n\u201cWith the party conventions taking place shortly, including the Republican convention next week, the candidates for President of the United States will soon be formally nominated. In assessing our responsibility to allow political expression, we believe that the American people should be able to hear from the nominees for President on the same basis,\u201d noted Clegg\u2019s statement, adding that the former president would still have to comply with Community Standards like other Facebook and Instagram users.\n\nTrump has criticised mainstream social media platforms in strong terms in recent years; he has instead thrown his support behind the Truth Social platform that is associated with right-wing and far-right ideologies.",

        "text": "Trump to announce his vice-president pick: Who is in the running?\nTrump to announce his vice-president pick: Who is in the running?\n\nReuters\n\nDonald Trump is expected to announce within hours who he has chosen as his Republican running mate. His vice-presidential pick will be unveiled on the first day of the Republican party convention in Milwaukee on Monday, according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner. There are three names getting a lot of buzz - JD Vance, Doug Burgum and Marco Rubio - and they are reportedly in the final three. But there are plenty of others who could spring a surprise. Here's a rundown.\n\nJD Vance\n\nReuters\n\nJD Vance, 39, the junior senator from Ohio, has rallied support for Trump on several occasions in recent months. The Yale-educated former venture capitalist wrote the best-selling book Hillbilly Elegy, a memoir that followed his blue-collar upbringing in the \"rust-belt\" Midwest. Once a self-identified \"never-Trumper\", Mr Vance refashioned himself when he ran for the Senate in 2022 with Trump's crucial endorsement. In office, he has championed many of the issues that animate Trump's base. Mr Vance believes he would be of better use to a future Trump administration in the Senate, but he has not ruled out being vice-president. \"I want to help him however I can,\" he recently said. Trump has also dismissed a rumour floating that Mr Vance's beard would disqualify him - as the former president is reportedly averse to facial hair.\n\nDoug Burgum\n\nReuters\n\nAnother of Trump's fallen primary opponents, Doug Burgum, 67, is in his second term as governor of North Dakota. Mr Burgum made little impact as a presidential candidate but has returned to the campaign trail with his endorsement of Trump. A social conservative and fiscal hawk, he said in 2023 that he would never conduct business with Trump because \"you're judged by the company you keep\". Mr Burgum began his career with a small software start-up later acquired by Microsoft and his years of entrepreneurship have earned him a billionaire fortune. He is reported to have impressed Trump with his low-drama demeanour and political know-how - attributes that led to the selection of former VP Mike Pence in 2016. North Dakota's near-total abortion ban, which Mr Burgum supported, is \"a little bit of an issue\", Trump said during an interview on Fox News radio. \"I think Doug is great, but... he's taken a very strong stance,\" he said. Burgum has said he supports leaving abortion laws up to individual states, and a proposed Republican party platform has dropped a section calling for a nationwide abortion ban. The abortion issue drove Democratic voters to the polls in 2022's midterm elections.\n\nMarco Rubio\n\nReuters\n\nTrump and Marco Rubio did not get on in the 2016 Republican primary race. Trump called him \"Little Marco\" - a reference to his stature - while Mr Rubio commented about Trump's small hands. The Florida senator has since worked closely with his former rival, endorsing him early on in this primary season. The son of working-class Cuban immigrants, Mr Rubio was once floated as a potential running mate to 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney. At only 53 he is comparatively young and telegenic, and he could help Trump gain a larger share of the Latino vote. Mr Rubio spoke at a rally for Trump in Florida on Tuesday, and afterwards the presidential candidate said: \"He's very good... Marco was great last night, very popular. And he's certainly one of the people that we're looking at.\" The US Constitution could create a small procedural hurdle. It specifies that a state must cast its electoral votes for at least one candidate, president or vice-president who is not a resident of the state. Both Mr Rubio and Trump live in Florida, meaning the 30 electoral votes allocated to that state could be in doubt. In practice, the issue could be solved by a large victory for the Republican ticket, or one of the candidates moving out of the Sunshine State. In 2000, Dick Cheney moved his official residence from Texas to Wyoming to become the running mate of another Texan, George W Bush. Trump has said the issue doesn't rule out Mr Rubio, \"but it does make it more complicated.\"\n\nTim Scott\n\nGetty Images\n\nBeyond the leading trio, there is another group of possible contenders which includes Tim Scott. The South Carolina senator is arguably the most prominent black Republican in the country. He was among the competitors Trump defeated in the party's primary contest. Mr Scott, 58, pitched his brand of optimistic conservativism, in a play for the influential evangelical Christian vote in early voting states, but his campaign never caught fire. After struggling to raise money, and three lacklustre debate performances, he exited and quickly endorsed Trump. It was his rousing remarks at a Trump campaign rally before the New Hampshire primary that elevated him as a top contender for vice-president. \"We need Donald Trump,\" he said, before appearing on stage during his fellow Republican's victory speech. He told Trump: \"I just love you.\" With a smile, the former president responded: \"That's why you're a great politician.\" Since then, Trump has often remarked that Mr Scott is \"much better [at advocating] for me than he was for himself\".\n\nByron Donalds\n\nGetty Images\n\nByron Donalds, 45, has helped raise the profile of black conservatism. Born in New York to a single mother, Mr Donalds worked in banking, insurance and finance before entering local politics in Florida in 2012. After four years in the Florida House of Representatives, he has served since 2020 in the US House, representing the right-wing flank of his party in Washington. On 15 June, Mr Donalds joined Trump at a Michigan campaign event aimed at winning over black voters. The former president openly touted Mr Donalds as a potential running mate. \"Byron Donalds is an incredible guy, and I noticed he happens to be on the list of potential vice-presidents,\" Trump said. \"Would anyone like to see him as a vice-president?\" In an interview with Fox News, he played coy when asked if he had discussed the job with Trump. \"Maybe, maybe not,\" Mr Donalds said. \"I'm going to keep that to myself.\" \"I think President Trump is going to make a great decision,\" the congressman continued. \"Obviously it's his decision, his decision alone.\" Talk of his joining the ticket has cooled in recent days, however, as US media has reported that Trump's shortlist has narrowed.\n\nElise Stefanik\n\nGetty Images\n\nElise Stefanik, 40, is a New York congresswoman and the highest-ranking Republican woman in the US House of Representatives. The once-moderate Trump-hesitant Republican has drifted to the right in recent years, and is now widely considered one of Trump's most loyal defenders on Capitol Hill, even joining his defence at his first impeachment trial in 2020. In recent months, she has also risen to modest fame in media circles, with her viral take-down of two Ivy League college presidents and elevation of the issue of antisemitism on US college campuses. She has said that she would be \"honoured\" to serve in the Trump administration \"in any capacity\", but she too has not appeared on recent lists of the top contenders.\n\nTulsi Gabbard\n\nGetty Images\n\nAs a Democrat, she was the first Hindu member of the US Congress. Now Tulsi Gabbard may be the biggest dark horse on Trump's list. A decade ago, the Iraq War veteran and US Army reservist served as vice-chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee - before resigning to endorse Bernie Sanders's 2016 presidential campaign. Her time in Congress, from 2013-21, was marked by frequent criticisms of the Obama administration and US military interventionism. She ran in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, with her most notable moment being a fierce critique of Kamala Harris - now the vice-president - over her past as a prosecutor in California. Ms Gabbard, 43, then beefed up her contributions to Fox News and announced in 2022 that she was leaving the Democratic Party. But she would still be a huge surprise if chosen.\n\nKristi Noem\n\nGetty Images\n\nKristi Noem, the governor of South Dakota, once topped a poll taken by mostly Trump diehards on whom he should pick as his vice-president. Ms Noem, 52, rose to national prominence with appearances on Fox News, especially when she flouted mask mandates and other restrictions during the pandemic. Her star was very much on the rise until the release of her memoir, in which she recounted the story of shooting her 14-month-old dog, because it wasn't a good hunting companion. Cricket was \"untrainable\" and \"dangerous\", she said. She also shot a goat she thought was \"nasty\" and \"mean\". The story brought almost universal condemnation, and her odds of becoming VP have lengthened considerably.\n\nOther names in the mix",

        "text": "Trump picks Sen. JD Vance as VP running mate for 2024 election\nFormer President Donald Trump has chosen Sen. JD Vance of Ohio to be his vice presidential running mate this November. Trump announced his VP pick on social media just before he was to accept the presidential nomination at the in Milwaukee on Monday.\n\nA source familiar with Vance's selection told CBS News that Vance flew privately to Mar a Lago to meet with Trump Saturday morning. He received the call from Trump asking him to be his running mate 20 minutes before the former president announced his selection on social media.\n\nTrump said in his social media post, \"After lengthy deliberation and thought, and considering the tremendous talents of many others, I have decided that the person best suited to assume the position of Vice President of the United States is Senator J.D. Vance of the Great State of Ohio.\"\n\nFile: Sen, J. D. Vance, (R-OH) addresses the conservative Turning Point People's Convention on June 16, 2024 at Huntington Place in Detroit, Michigan. JEFF KOWALSKY/AFP via Getty Images\n\nHe said of Vance that he had \"honorably served our Country in the Marine Corps, graduated from Ohio State University in two years, Summa Cum Laude, and is a Yale Law School Graduate, where he was Editor of The Yale Law Journal, and President of the Yale Law Veterans Association.\"\n\nThe former president noted that Vance's book, \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" was a best-seller that \"championed the hardworking men and women of our Country.\" And he pointed to Vance's previous career as a venture capitalist.\n\nA source familiar with Vance's selection told CBS News that Vance flew privately to Mar a Lago to meet with Trump Saturday morning. He received the call from Trump asking him to be his running mate 20 minutes before the the former president announced his selection on social media.\n\nVance, who is just 39, is half Trump's age, is one of the youngest men to be a vice presidential nominee and is political neophyte, a first-term senator who's only been in office for about a year and a half.\n\nSources confirmed before Vance's selection was announced that Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who were also considered to be top contenders for the No. 2 job, were informed that they had not been chosen. Upon the announcement that Vance was the pick, Burgum said in a social media post that his \"small town roots and service to country make him a powerful voice for the America First Agenda.\"\n\nAlthough Vance wasn't at the Pennsylvania rally where a shooter made an attempt on the former president's life, the senator expressed his concern and support for the president from Ohio. He also shared fundraising information for the families of those who were killed or injured at the rally.\n\n\"Courageous, United, and Defiant. This is leadership,\" Vance wrote on X over the weekend after Trump asked Americans to remain \"resilient\" in their faith and \"defiant in the face of wickedness.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign released a campaign video showing clips of Vance appearing on the campaign trail with Trump, and his TV appearances and concluded it with the Trump-Vance campaign logo.\n\nVance has frequently joined Trump on the campaign trail and was long considered to be on the shortlist of VP contenders. Vance and his wife, Usha, were spotted leaving their Ohio home Monday morning, a sign that Vance might be the pick.\n\nOhio has been a reliably Republican-dominated state in recent elections, although the senior senator from the state, Sherrod Brown, is a Democrat and is also up for reelection this year. But Trump has focused less on choosing a running mate from a key battleground state and more on the qualities in a candidate that matter most to him.\n\nTrump has prioritized picking a running mate who would be loyal to him and support him publicly, as Vance has increasingly done through the years.\n\nInitially, though, Vance harshly criticized Trump and was an avowed \"Never-Trump guy.\" Earlier this year, Fox News' Bett Baier confronted Vance with some of his previous statements, including comments that Trump could be \"America's Hitler\" and \"cultural heroin.\" Vance told Baier he was \"wrong\" about Trump.\n\n\"I think you should, when you are wrong about something, you should change your mind and be honest with people about that fact,\" Vance said in the interview.\n\nVance grew up in challenging circumstances, largely raised by his grandparents before going on to college and law school at Yale.\n\nNow one of Trump's most vocal allies, Vance defended the former president during his criminal trial in Manhattan, including after his conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records for \"hush money\" payments.\n\n\"The entire purpose of this trial was to allow the media and the Democrats to say exactly that,\" Vance told CNN after the New York verdict. \"This was never about justice, this is about plastering 'convicted felon' all over the airwaves when in reality the only thing that Donald Trump is guilty of is being in the courtroom of a political sham trial.\"\n\nAsked in a June interview on \"Face the Nation\" about his interest in the vice presidency and his relatively brief experience in the Senate, Vance said, \"In 18 months \u2026 we've done a lot of good work for our constituents.\"\n\nVance represents a departure from Mike Pence, who was Trump's vice president in his first two presidential nominations. Vance has said in the past that he would have refused to certify the election on Jan. 6, 2020, if he had been in Pence's position.\n\n\"If I had been vice president, I would have told the states, like Pennsylvania, Georgia and so many others that we needed to have multiple slates of electors,\" he told ABC News in early February, \"and I think the U.S. Congress should have fought over it from there. That is the legitimate way to deal with an election that a lot of folks, including me, think had a lot of problems in 2020. I think that's what we should have done.\"\n\nIn 2020, Trump pressured Pence, who presided over the joint session of Congress that affirmed the results of the presidential election, to refuse to certify the electoral votes that showed Joe Biden had won. Pence did not agree to do so, concluding that his role was ceremonial, and he ultimately announced that Mr. Biden had won \u2014 after an attack on the Capitol that day. Since then, Trump has continued to publicly claim that Pence \"did have the right to change the outcome.\"\n\nThe job of the vice president is to read the results of each state according to the the 12th Amendment. The Electoral Count Act of 1877, the other law concerning the certification of votes, does not give vice presidents the power to overturn the vote either. Numerous legal experts have denied that there is any interpretation of these laws that would have given Pence the power to reject the outcome of the election on January 6.\n\nCaitlin Huey-Burns and Jacob Rosen contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Ask an expert: Health care in the 2024 presidential election\nUNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. \u2014 Health care has often taken a central role in political campaigns, and the 2024 presidential election is no different. But the debate around health care isn\u2019t just about policy. The issues at stake \u2014 such as health care coverage and affordability, reproductive health and substance use disorders \u2014 affect individuals and families in Pennsylvania and across the nation, making it a high priority among voters.\n\nPenn State News spoke with four faculty experts about the pressing issues and how it may impact voters and their families.\n\nQ: How has political polarization changed the way government approaches policy making, especially when it comes to key issues like health care?\n\nDaniel Mallinson, associate professor of public policy and administration at Penn State Harrisburg, studies why states adopt innovative policies and what we can learn from the individual and macro-level patterns of policy and is particularly interested in Pennsylvania state politics.\n\nMallinson: Our recent research has demonstrated that polarization is exaggerating the dynamics of policymaking in Congress. By that I mean that there are longer periods of relative stasis, where either nothing gets done or things change incrementally, but when change happens it tends to be bigger.\n\nHealth care, specifically the Affordable Care Act (ACA), is a good example. Changes to national health care policy took a very long time, but when the political dynamics were right, it resulted in a major policy change. We also see that those big changes tend to be less bipartisan, which helps explain the exaggeration in stasis for many policy areas.\n\nQ: How has the Affordable Care Act affected health care coverage and access? If the ACA is repealed, how does that affect me and my family?\n\nDennis Scanlon, distinguished professor of health policy and administration, studies health policy and reform and can speak to health care affordability and efforts to fairly distribute funding resulting from opioid manufacturers and distributors.\n\nScanlon: Overall, the Affordable Care Act has helped people get health insurance and increased the number of people with health insurance in the United States.\n\nIt\u2019s highly unlikely that the ACA is going to be repealed. If anything were to be repealed, it\u2019s more likely to be pieces of the ACA that are dismantled. The impact would depend on what pieces are dismantled and one\u2019s individual circumstances. For example, if an individual currently receives subsidies to buy insurance on the health care exchange and if those subsidies are broken up, that may influence their choice in terms of whether or not they become or stay insured.\n\nQ: How has the Dobbs decision \u2014 the landmark Supreme Court decision in June 2022 that overturned the constitutional right to abortion \u2014 changed reproductive health care such as patient access to care?\n\nSarah Horvath, associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Penn State College of Medicine, is available to discuss reproductive health care, including access to reproductive health services, contraceptive counseling, miscarriage management and the safety of mifepristone, one of two medications used in a medication abortion.\n\nHorvath: The impacts of the Dobbs decision are geographically dependent. Many of the total bans and early bans on abortion are clustered across a wide swath of the South. What we\u2019ve seen is that in those states, there\u2019s been a huge drop in overall volume of abortion care being provided. But if you look at the data from the whole country, we\u2019ve actually seen an increase in the volume of abortion care being provided.\n\nWhat that means is that people must travel for care. It\u2019s really deepened the inequities in access to care because those who have the resources to travel will travel and the people who don\u2019t can\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s also affecting access to ongoing pregnancy care because these policies have had a chilling effect on providers. Take Idaho, for example. It\u2019s a state that already had too few obstetricians and maternal-fetal medicine specialists, who care for high-risk pregnancies. There\u2019s been an exodus of providers from the state, which means that people toward the end of their pregnancies are now traveling to neighboring states just to access normal obstetrical care.\n\nQ: Have more restrictive reproductive health care policies had any surprising effects?\n\nHorvath: We\u2019re seeing a lot of trickle-down effects. I provide care for complex miscarriage, stillbirth, ectopic pregnancy and other conditions and we\u2019re seeing that the medications and techniques used to treat these conditions are affected too. There are states where the medication mifepristone isn\u2019t available for miscarriage management, even though we know it improves outcomes. It makes care more efficient, safer and better for mom, but we\u2019re not giving people access to this medication because of its association with abortion. Similarly, some medication to treat cancer or conditions like rheumatoid arthritis are harder to access because their historical association with abortion care. Women no longer can access these medications, but men can.\n\nWe\u2019re also witnessing brain-drain in the profession. It\u2019s not just OBGYN, but it\u2019s also impacting family medicine doctors and, in one survey, even psychiatrists were considering leaving states because of the lack of ability to provide full care to their patients. Even among medical students, there\u2019s been a decrease in interest in residency programs in state with abortion bans across the board in all specialties.\n\nQ: How has the increase in substance use disorders, particularly opioid use, affected our society both nationally and in our communities?\n\nAbenaa Jones, Ann Atherton Hertzler Early Career Professor in health and human development and assistant professor of human development and family studies, has expertise in the social and structural determinants of substance use among vulnerable populations.\n\nJones: Substance use continues to be a pressing national concern as drug overdose deaths continue to climb. Substance use affects communities and the nation through the breakdown of families, particularly when the criminal legal system and child welfare are involved, increases health care costs and loss of productivity, impacts educational attainment and increases in infectious diseases such as HIV and Hepatitis C.\n\nQ: Are there populations that are disproportionately affected by substance use disorders?\n\nJones: Populations most affected include vulnerable and marginalized groups who face a disproportionate burden of poverty and limited social mobility, and who live in under-resourced areas, such as rural communities or low-income urban areas. Moreover, available data suggests that soaring overdose deaths among racially/ethnically minoritized individuals are mainly attributed to poor quality drugs and fentanyl contamination often found in under-resourced areas and lack of access to quality substance use treatment, overdose reversal drugs and harm reduction services.\n\nFor more information or to speak with one of our election experts, contact mediarelations@psu.edu.",

        "text": "Who is JD Vance? Things to know about Donald Trump\u2019s pick for vice president\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) \u2014 Former President Donald Trump on Monday chose U.S. Sen. JD Vance of Ohio to be his running mate as he looks to return to the White House.\n\nHere are some things to know about Vance, a 39-year-old Republican now in his first term in the Senate:\n\nVance rose to prominence with the memoir \u2018Hillbilly Elegy\u2019\n\nVance was born and raised in Middletown, Ohio. He joined the Marines and served in Iraq, and later earned degrees from Ohio State University and Yale Law School. He also worked as a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley.\n\nVance made a name for himself with his memoir, the 2016 bestseller \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d which was published as Trump was first running for president. The book earned Vance a reputation as someone who could help explain the maverick New York businessman\u2019s appeal in middle America, especially among the working class, rural white voters who helped Trump win the presidency.\n\n\u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d also introduced Vance to the Trump family. Donald Trump Jr. loved the book and knew of Vance when he went to launch his political career. The two hit it off and have remained friends.\n\nHe was first elected to public office in 2022\n\nAfter Donald Trump won the 2016 election, Vance returned to his native Ohio and set up an anti-opioid charity. He also took to the lecture circuit and was a favored guest at Republican Lincoln Day dinners where his personal story \u2014 including the hardship Vance endured because of his mother\u2019s drug addiction \u2014 resonated.\n\nVance\u2019s appearances were opportunities to sell his ideas for fixing the country and helped lay the groundwork for entering politics in 2021, when he sought the Senate seat vacated by Republican Rob Portman, who retired.\n\nTrump endorsed Vance. Vance went on to win a crowded Republican primary and the general election.\n\nHe and Trump have personal chemistry\n\nPersonal relationships are extremely important to the former president and he and Vance have developed a strong rapport over years, speaking on the phone regularly.\n\nTrump has also complimented Vance\u2019s beard, saying he \u201clooks like a young Abraham Lincoln.\u201d\n\nVance went from never-Trumper to fierce ally\n\nVance was a \u201cnever Trump\u201d Republican in 2016. He called Trump \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cunfit\u201d for office. Vance, whose wife, lawyer Usha Chilukuri Vance, is Indian American and the mother of their three children, also criticized Trump\u2019s racist rhetoric, saying he could be \u201cAmerica\u2019s Hitler.\u201d\n\nBut by the time Vance met Trump in 2021, he had reversed his opinion, citing Trump\u2019s accomplishments as president. Both men downplayed Vance\u2019s past scathing criticism.\n\nOnce elected, Vance became a fierce Trump ally on Capitol Hill, unceasingly defending Trump\u2019s policies and behavior.\n\nHe is a leading conservative voice\n\nKevin Roberts, president of the conservative Heritage Foundation, called Vance a leading voice for the conservative movement, on key issues including a shift away from interventionist foreign policy, free market economics and \u201cAmerican culture writ large.\u201d\n\nDemocrats call him an extremist, citing provocative positions Vance has taken but sometimes later amended. Vance signaled support for a national 15-week abortion ban during his Senate run, for instance, then softened that stance once Ohio voters overwhelmingly backed a 2023 abortion rights amendment.\n\nHe is married to a lawyer who was a Supreme Court clerk\n\nVance met his wife, Usha Chilukuri Vance, at Yale, where she received both her undergraduate and law degrees. She spent a year clerking for future Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh when he served as an appeals court judge in Washington, followed by a year as a law clerk to Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nShe had been a trial lawyer for the Munger, Tolles and Olson law firm. Her law firm announced Monday that she had left the firm.\n\n\u201cUsha has been an excellent lawyer and colleague, and we thank her for her years of work and wish her the best in her future career,\u201d Munger, Tolles & Olson said in a statement.\n\nVance has adopted Trump\u2019s rhetoric about Jan. 6\n\nOn the 2020 election, he said he wouldn\u2019t have certified the results immediately if he had been vice president and said Trump had \u201ca very legitimate grievance.\u201d He has put conditions on honoring the results of the 2024 election that echo Trump\u2019s. A litany of government and outside investigations have not found any election fraud that could have swung the outcome of Trump\u2019s 2020 loss to Democratic President Joe Biden.\n\nIn the Senate, Vance sometimes embraces bipartisanship. He and Democratic Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown co-sponsored a railway safety bill following a fiery train derailment in the Ohio village of East Palestine. He\u2019s sponsored legislation extending and increasing funding for Great Lakes restoration, and supported bipartisan legislation boosting workers and families.\n\nVance can articulate Trump\u2019s vision\n\nPeople familiar with the vice presidential vetting process said Vance would bring to the GOP ticket debating skills and the ability to articulate Trump\u2019s vision.\n\nCharlie Kirk, founder of the conservative activist group Turning Point USA, said Vance compellingly articulates the America First world view and could help Trump in states he closely lost in 2020, such as Michigan and Wisconsin, that share Ohio\u2019s values, demographics and economy.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Jill Colvin in Milwaukee and Mark Sherman in Washington contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Trump picks Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, a once-fierce critic turned loyal ally, as his GOP running mate\nMILWAUKEE (AP) \u2014 Former President Donald Trump chose Sen. JD Vance of Ohio as his running mate on Monday, picking a onetime critic who became a loyal ally and is now the first millennial to join a major-party ticket at a time of deep concern about the advanced age of America\u2019s political leaders.\n\n\u201cAfter lengthy deliberation and thought, and considering the tremendous talents of many others, I have decided that the person best suited to assume the position of Vice President of the United States is Senator J.D. Vance of the Great State of Ohio,\u201d Trump said in a post on his Truth Social network as the Republican National Convention got underway in Milwaukee.\n\nHours later, Vance formally received his party\u2019s formal nomination after walking onto the floor of the convention to Merle Haggard\u2019s \u201cAmerican First.\u201d He and Trump \u2014 who had a large bandage on his right ear after Saturday\u2019s shooting \u2014 sat next to each other in Trump\u2019s box during the convention\u2019s opening night program.\n\nThe 39-year-old Vance rose to national fame with the 2016 publication of his memoir, \u201cHillbilly Elegy.\u201d He was elected to the Senate in 2022 and has become one of the staunchest champions of the former president\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d agenda, particularly on trade, foreign policy and immigration.\n\nBut he is largely untested in national politics and is joining the Trump ticket at an extraordinary moment in American history. An attempted assassination of Trump at a rally Saturday has shaken the campaign, bringing new attention to the nation\u2019s coarse political rhetoric and reinforcing the importance of those who are one heartbeat away from the presidency.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nVance himself faced criticism in the wake of the shooting for a post on X that suggested President Joe Biden was to blame for the violence.\n\n\u201cThe central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs,\u201d Vance wrote. \u201cThat rhetoric led directly to President Trump\u2019s attempted assassination.\u201d\n\nLaw enforcement has not yet specified a motivation for the shooting.\n\nWhy Vance was chosen over the other finalists\n\nThe pick is sure to energize Trump\u2019s loyal base. Vance has become a fixture on the conservative media circuit and frequently spars with reporters on Capitol Hill, helping establish him as the kind of leader who could carry Trump\u2019s mantle into the future, beginning with the next presidential election in 2028.\n\nBut the pick also means that two white men will now lead the Republican ticket at a time when Trump has sought to make inroads with Black and Latino voters.\n\nIn his post announcing his pick, Trump said Vance \u201cwill be strongly focused on the people he fought so brilliantly for, the American Workers and Farmers in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Minnesota, and far beyond.\u201d Several of those Midwestern states are expected to play a critical role in November\u2019s election.\n\nBut Vance also had another advantage: his chemistry with Trump. Personal relationships are extremely important to the former president and he and Vance have developed a strong rapport, speaking on the phone regularly.\n\nTrump has also complimented Vance\u2019s looks, saying he reminded him of \u201ca young Abraham Lincoln.\u201d\n\nTrump formally offered Vance the job in a phone call that came about 20 minutes before his Truth Social post, according to a person familiar with the call who requested anonymity to share details of the private conversation.\n\nVance told Fox News host Sean Hannity in his first interview since his selection that he knew Trump was calling with big news, but didn\u2019t know if it was good or bad. He said the former president told him he could help win Midwestern swing states such as Michigan, and thought he would do well in the vice presidential debate.\n\nTrump had long said he wanted to dramatically reveal his pick onstage at the convention, which he said would make it more \u201cinteresting\u201d and \u201cexciting.\u201d The timing is later than in recent cycles, but hardly unprecedented. In 1980, Ronald Reagan made his decision less than 24 hours before he formally accepted the GOP nomination, and George H.W. Bush waited until his convention in 1988.\n\nBiden\u2019s reelection campaign issued a statement calling out Vance for saying, had he been vice president, he would have allowed \u201cmultiple slates of electors\u201d to challenge Biden\u2019s victory over Trump four years ago. Trump repeatedly promoted falsehoods about election fraud before and after Jan. 6, 2021, when rioters loyal to the former president stormed the Capitol to try to stop the certification of his loss.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump picked J.D. Vance as his running mate because Vance will do what Mike Pence wouldn\u2019t on January 6: bend over backwards to enable Trump and his extreme MAGA agenda, even if it means breaking the law and no matter the harm to the American people,\u201d Biden campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon said in the statement.\n\nTrump had spent months testing the field, assessing how his contenders performed on television, at fundraisers and on rally stages. Several joined him at his criminal hush money trial in New York. Others were there at the debate last month, where Biden\u2019s disastrous performance upended his campaign, leading to widespread calls for him to step aside in favor or a younger candidate.\n\nVance once was a harsh Trump critic\n\nThe relationship between Vance and Trump has been symbiotic.\n\nVance\u2019s fame grew in tandem with Trump\u2019s unlikely rise from a reality television star to Republican presidential nominee and eventually president. During the early stages of Trump\u2019s political career, Vance cast him as \u201ca total fraud,\u201d \u201ca moral disaster\u201d and \u201cAmerica\u2019s Hitler.\u201d\n\nBut like many Republicans who sought relevance in the Trump era, Vance eventually shifted his tone. He said he was proved wrong by Trump\u2019s performance in office and evolved into one of his most steadfast defenders.\n\n\u201cI was certainly skeptical of Donald Trump in 2016, but President Trump was a great president and he changed my mind,\u201d Vance said in his interview with Hannity. \u201cI think he changed the minds of a lot of Americans, because again he delivered that peace and prosperity.\u201d\n\nVance was rewarded for his turnaround during his bid for an open Senate seat in 2022, during which he landed Trump\u2019s coveted endorsement and rode it to victory in a crowded Republican primary and a general election hard fought by Democrats. He is close to Trump\u2019s son Donald Jr.\n\n\u201cListen, I\u2019ve seen him on TV,\u201d Donald Trump Jr. said of Vance, speaking to CNN from the convention floor. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him prosecute the case against the Democrats. No one\u2019s more articulate than that. And I think his story, his background, really helps us in a lot of the places that you\u2019re going to need from the Electoral College standpoint.\u201d\n\nVance is now a Trump loyalist who has challenged the legitimacy of criminal prosecutions and civil verdicts against him and questions the results of the 2020 election.\n\nHe told ABC News in February that, if he had been vice president on Jan. 6, 2021, he would have told states where Trump disputed Biden wins \u201cthat we needed to have multiple slates of electors, and I think the U.S. Congress should have fought over it from there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is the legitimate way to deal with an election that a lot of folks, including me, think had a lot of problems in 2020,\u201d he said.\n\nMany states adopted emergency measures four years ago to allow people to vote safely during the COVID-19 pandemic. But judges, election officials in both parties and Trump\u2019s own attorney general have concluded there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election.\n\nVance\u2019s book vaulted him to national prominence\n\nVance\u2019s book \u2014 subtitled \u201cA Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis\u201d \u2014 detailed life in Appalachian communities that drifted from a Democratic Party many residents found disconnected from their daily travails. It was embraced for its insights into Trump\u2019s appeal in middle America, where manufacturing job losses and the opioid crisis had driven many families like his into poverty, abuse and addiction, but it was also criticized for sometimes oversimplifying rural life and ignoring the role of racism in modern politics.\n\nThe tale of Vance\u2019s hardscrabble childhood in Middletown, Ohio, where he was born, and his familial eastern Kentucky hills region also captivated Hollywood. Ron Howard made it into a 2020 movie starring Amy Adams as Vance\u2019s mother and Glenn Close as his beloved \u201cMamaw.\u201d\n\nBecause of that difficult upbringing, \u201cI actually understand a little bit what people are going through,\u201d Vance said on Fox. \u201cYeah, it was tough when I was dealing with it, but now I really do think it\u2019s a blessing that\u2019s given me a perspective a lot of politicians don\u2019t have.\u201d\n\nWith his grandmother\u2019s encouragement, Vance went on to serve in the Marine Corps, including in Iraq, and to graduate from Ohio State University and Yale Law School. From there, he joined a Silicon Valley investment firm before returning to Ohio to launch a nonprofit that he said would aim to develop opioid addiction treatments that might be \u201cscaled nationally.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Our Ohio Renewal failed at that mission and was shuttered. During the 2022 campaign, then-U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan, his Democratic rival, charged that the charity was little more than a front for Vance\u2019s political ambitions. Ryan pointed to reports that the organization made payments to a Vance political adviser and conducted public opinion polling, even as its actual efforts to address addiction largely floundered. Vance denied the characterization.\n\nAs a senator, Vance has shown some willingness to work across the aisle. He and Ohio\u2019s senior senator, Democrat Sherrod Brown, have teamed up on a number of issues important to the state, including fighting for funding for a $20 billion chip facility Intel is building in central Ohio and introducing rail safety legislation in response to the fiery derailment in East Palestine, Ohio.\n\n___\n\nSmyth reported from Butler, Pennsylvania.

        "text": "In primetime address, Biden says US must not go down road of political violence\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden on Sunday urged Americans to reject political violence and recommit themselves to resolving their differences peacefully, saying the upcoming presidential election will be a \u201ctime of testing\u201d in the aftermath of the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump.\n\nIn a prime-time national address from the Oval Office, Biden said political passions can run high but \u201cwe must never descend into violence.\u201d The president said his party and the Republicans can compete forcefully over different policy visions \u2014 but must do it in a civil fashion.\n\n\u201cAll of us now face a time of testing as the election approaches,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThere is no place in America for this kind of violence \u2014 for any violence. Ever. Period. No exception. We can\u2019t allow this violence to be normalized.\u201d\n\nBiden spoke for six minutes in his third address to the nation since Saturday evening\u2019s attack by a shooter that left Trump with a bloodied ear, killed one rallygoer and seriously injured two others. His warning came hours after FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate said agents have seen increasingly violent rhetoric online since the attack at the Trump rally.\n\nAP AUDIO: In prime-time address, Biden asks Americans to reject political violence and \u2018cool it down\u2019 President Biden says America must not go down the road of political violence, in an address to the nation after the attempted killing of GOP rival Donald Trump. AP correspondent Sagar Meghani reports.\n\nSince the shooting, the president and his team had been grappling with how to calibrate the political path forward after the weekend attack targeting the very person Biden is trying to defeat in November\u2019s election. Biden sharply condemned the attack, but indicated he plans to continue to press his campaign agenda and has \u201cno doubt\u201d Republicans will do the same when they open the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee on Monday.\n\nHe emphasized that said those disagreements must remain peaceful.\n\n\u201cWe can do this,\u201d Biden pleaded, saying the nation was founded on a democracy that gave reason and balance a chance to prevail over brute force. Biden also warned that political tensions were being inflamed by a balkanized media environment and exploited by American enemies.\n\n\u201cHere in America we need to get out of our silos, where we only listen to those with whom we agree, where misinformation is rampant, where foreign actors fan the flames of our division to shape the outcomes consistent with their interests, not ours,\u201d Biden said.\n\nEarlier Sunday, Biden was briefed in the White House Situation Room and condemned the attempted assassination of Trump as \u201ccontrary to everything we stand for as a nation.\u201d He said he was ordering an independent security review of how such an attack could have happened.\n\nThe president said he has also directed the U.S. Secret Service to review all security measures for the RNC. Hours later, Audrey Gibson-Cicchino, the Secret Service\u2019s coordinator for the convention, said the weekend attack against Trump did not warrant any changes to the agency\u2019s security plan for the event and officials \u201care fully prepared.\u201d\n\nBiden promised a \u201cthorough and swift\u201d review and asked the public not to \u201cmake assumptions\u201d about the shooter\u2019s motives or affiliations.\n\nThe president said he and first lady Jill Biden were praying for the family of Corey Comperatore, a former fire chief who was shot and killed during the Trump rally Saturday night in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cHe was protecting his family from the bullets,\u201d Biden said. \u201cGod love him.\u201d\n\nThe president also said he\u2019d had a \u201cshort but good conversation\u201d with Trump in the hours after the shootings and said he was \u201csincerely grateful\u201d that the former president is \u201cdoing well and recovering.\u201d\n\nTrump, who has called for national resilience since the shooting, posted on his social media account after Biden\u2019s remarks, \u201cUNITE AMERICA!\u201d\n\nBiden, who has set out to brand Trump as a dire threat to democracy and the nation\u2019s very founding principles, put a temporary pause on such political messaging after the shooting. Shortly after Saturday night\u2019s attack, Biden\u2019s reelection campaign froze \u201call outbound communications\u201d and worked to pull down its television ads.\n\nThe president also postponed a planned trip to Texas on Monday, where he was to speak on the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act at the Lyndon B. Johnson presidential library. An NBC News interview between Biden and anchor Lester Holt will now occur at the White House, instead of in Texas, as initially planned.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign said that, after the NBC interview airs on Monday night, the Democratic National Committee \u201cwill continue drawing the contrast\u201d with Trump over the course of the GOP convention. It was unclear when campaign ads will resume.\n\nBiden still plans to make a planned trip to Las Vegas, which will include a campaign event Wednesday. Vice President Kamala Harris postponed her planned campaign trip to Florida on Tuesday, where she had been set to meet with Republican women.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, arrived Sunday evening in Milwaukee for the Republican convention, where criticism of Biden and the Democrats is sure to be searing.\n\nThe weekend developments were only the latest upheaval in a campaign that has been extraordinarily topsy-turvy in recent weeks.\n\nBiden\u2019s shaky debate performance on June 27 so spooked his own party that some top surrogates and donors turned on him, and nearly 20 Democratic members of Congress called on the president to leave the race outright. Facing mounting questions about whether he was fit for a second term, Biden and his top advisers have been scrambling to salvage his campaign by adding events around the country and more aggressively criticizing Trump.\n\nSaturday\u2019s attack upended \u2014 at least temporarily \u2014 that counteroffensive. The campaign hoped that Sunday\u2019s Oval Office address let Biden further drive home his point about unity while demonstrating leadership that could assuage nervous critics within his own party.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll debate and we\u2019ll disagree, that\u2019s not going to change,\u201d Biden said in his afternoon remarks. \u201cBut we\u2019ll not lose sight of who we are as Americans.\u201d\n\nBiden tied Saturday\u2019s shooting to other incidents of political violence, from the 2017 death of a counterprotester at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, to the Capitol insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021, by Trump supports seeking to prevent the certification of the Electoral College count.\n\nAlthough investigators are still in the early stages of determining what occurred and why, some Biden critics were calling out the president for telling donors in a private call Monday that \u201cit\u2019s time to put Trump in the bullseye.\u201d\n\nA person familiar with those remarks said the president was trying to make the point that Trump had gotten away with a light public schedule after last month\u2019s debate while the president himself faced intense scrutiny. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity to more freely discuss private conversations.\n\nIn the donor call, Biden said: \u201cI have one job and that\u2019s to beat Donald Trump. ... I\u2019m absolutely certain I\u2019m the best person to be able to do that.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cSo, we\u2019re done talking about the debate. It\u2019s time to put Trump in the bullseye. He\u2019s gotten away with doing nothing for the last 10 days except ride around in his golf cart, bragging about scores he didn\u2019t score. \u2026 Anyway I won\u2019t get into his golf game.\u201d",

        "text": "Kagame wins Rwanda\u2019s presidential elections in landslide\nRwandan President Paul Kagame has won the country\u2019s presidential election with 99% of the vote, according to preliminary election results released late Monday evening.\n\nKagame had won 99% of the 79% of ballots counted so far, the country\u2019s electoral body said.\n\nThe president, who has been in power in various roles since 1994, won by a similar amount in 2017.\n\nPeople stood in line patiently starting at 7 a.m. local time Monday to cast their ballots, saying they were excited to exercise their civic duty. Some told VOA they wanted a leader who could deliver what the population desired. Others said they\u2019d seen progress and would vote for that to continue.\n\nKagame cast his vote around 1:30 p.m. at a voting center in Kigali. He had said that his priorities of building the country toward prosperity would not change.\n\nKagame, who was first elected president in 2000, faced two other candidates: the Democratic Green Party's Frank Habineza and independent Philippe Mpayimana.\n\nHabineza was in second place with 0.53% of the vote while Mpayimana had 0.32%.\n\nThis was the second bid for the top job by Mpayimana, a journalist-turned-politician whose manifesto initiatives to develop agriculture, transportation, fishing and other industries received coverage in 50-plus articles.\n\nHabineza, who also ran against Kagame in the last election, told VOA he was in the race again this year because the incumbent has been in office too long and it was time for a new vision for the country.\n\nSeveral other candidates, including some of Kagame\u2019s most vocal critics, were barred from running for president.\n\nAbout 9 million out of a population of 14 million Rwandans were registered to vote. That was 2 million more than last time, according to the National Electoral Commission.\n\nNEC Chairwoman Oda Gasinzigwa said that more than 300 international observers were present in Rwanda, along with about 700 local observers.\n\nOne reason Kagame, 66, cruised to victory, critics said, was that he has governed with a heavy hand and has stifled dissent. But another reason, analysts said, was his ability to guide the East African country toward internal peace since the 1994 genocide, when an estimated 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed by Hutu extremists.",

        "text": "What Donald Trump assassination bid means for US Presidential Elections 2024 - Explained in 5 points\nThe assassination bid at Donald Trump during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday night is expected to impact the race for the White House. While the motive behind the attack is unknown, it will certainly affect the political discourse, campaigning and voter behavior in the run up to the November 8 polls, experts suggest.\n\nAll eyes on Republican Convention The first possible consequence would be on display in the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Republicans are gathering from July 15 at the four-day event to begin the official process of nominating Trump as their Presidential candidate.\n\nAlso Read | Donald Trump LIVE: Russia points finger at Biden govt for assassination attempt\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign has said that he still plans to attend the Republican Convention. \u201cRepublicans will leverage the shooting over the four-day event, and try to capitalize on Trump\u2019s lead and cast him as a sympathetic figure and fighter of oppressive forces,\u201d Nick Beauchamp, associate professor of political science at Northeastern University, was quoted as saying by Northeastern Global News.\n\nFollowing the attack, Trump released a statement thanking the Secret Service and law enforcement. He also expressed his condolences to the other victims.\n\n\u201cThe images of Trump in the immediate aftermath of the shooting are likely to become iconic,\u201d Douglas Brinkley, a Historian at Rice University told the Washington Post.\n\nSympathy for Trump? Brinkley said there is something in the US spirit that likes seeing fortitude and courage under pressure and the fact that Trump held his fist up high will become a new symbol.\n\n\u201cBy surviving an attempted assassination, you become a martyr, because you get a groundswell of public sympathy,\u201d he said.\n\nLong Road for Joe Biden?\n\nRepublican pollster Frank Luntz said the shooting guarantees every Trump voter will actually vote, while Biden won't be able to count on that certainty.\n\n\"The long and winding road for Joe Biden just became even longer and windier. The shooting of Donald Trump will be significantly consequential in a way the shooter never intended,\" Luntz posted on X.\n\nTrump's shooting is said to overtake the campaign's hitherto dominant narrative, which talked about the disarray within the Democrats following President Joe Biden\u2019s debate performance and the growing clamour asking him to step aside and allow a younger candidate to take over.\n\nSoon after the attack, Biden decried the violence as \u2018sick\u2019 before a phone call with his rival Democrat. In a televised address later, Biden again condemned the attack on Trump, reiterating that there is \u2018no place in America\u2019 for this kind of violence.\n\nAlso Read | Mary Millben to sing US national anthem for Donald Trump nomination speech\n\n\u201cTonight, I want to speak to what we do know. A former president was shot, and an American citizen was killed, while simply exercising his freedom to support the candidate of his choosing. We cannot, we must not go down this road in America we've travelled before throughout our history; violence has never been the answer,\u201d Biden said.\n\nSteve Schmidt, a former Republican strategist and a Trump critic, said that the political consequences of the Trump shooting would be immense, and will potentially benefit the former President in the race.\n\n\u201cHistorically, the assassination target most like Trump is George Wallace, but when it comes to the response to being shot the only presidential equivalent to Trump\u2019s response was that of Teddy Roosevelt,\u201d Schmidt said in a post on X.\n\nOn October 14, 1912, there was an assassination attempt at former US President Theodore Roosevelt while he was campaigning for the presidency in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Roosevelt, eventually, lost the 1912 election, finishing second to Woodrow Wilson.\n\nNot the first attack With the attack on Saturday night, Trump became the 13th US president or presidential candidate to face an assassination bid, and the eighth to survive.\n\n\"The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump's attempted assassination,\" Ohio Senator JD Vance, a possible Trump running mate, posted on X.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign is now limited in how it can push forward, according to reports. The outburst of political violence stymies his efforts to argue his case. It also undercuts a core premise of his presidency \u2014 that he would restore decency and normalcy to national politics, according to a report in Bloomberg.\n\nThe swing voters? The shooting confirmed the fears of half of swing-state voters, who said in a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll in May that they were worried about violence surrounding the election, the Bloomberg report said.",

        "text": "Day 1 of the 2024 Republican National Convention\nUS Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle on Monday released her first statement since the assassination attempt against Donald Trump on Saturday.\n\nRead the statement in full below:\n\n\u201cI would like to start by extending my deepest condolences to the family and friends of Corey Comperatore, who was killed during the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump\u2019s life in Butler, Pennsylvania, Saturday, as well as those who were injured during this senseless act of violence.\n\nSecret Service personnel on the ground moved quickly during the incident, with our counter sniper team neutralizing the shooter and our agents implementing protective measures to ensure the safety of former president Donald Trump.\n\nSince the shooting, I have been in constant contact with Secret Service personnel in Pennsylvania who worked to maintain the integrity of the crime scene until the FBI assumed its role as the lead investigating agency into the assassination attempt. I have also been coordinating with the protective detail for former President Trump and have briefed President Biden on the details of the incident.\n\nThe Secret Service is working with all involved Federal, state and local agencies to understand what happened, how it happened, and how we can prevent an incident like this from ever taking place again. We understand the importance of the independent review announced by President Biden yesterday and will participate fully. We will also work with the appropriate Congressional committees on any oversight action.\n\nThe incident in Pennsylvania has understandably led to questions about potential updates or changes to the security for the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. The U.S. Secret Service, in conjunction with our Federal, state and local law enforcement and public safety partners, designs operational security plans for National Special Security Events (NSSE) to be dynamic in order to respond to a kinetic security environment and the most up-to-date intelligence from our partners.\n\nI am confident in the security plan our Secret Service RNC coordinator and our partners have put in place, which we have reviewed and strengthened in the wake of Saturday\u2019s shooting. The security plans for National Special Security Events are designed to be flexible. As the conventions progress, and in accordance with the direction of the President, the Secret Service will continuously adapt our operations as necessary in order to ensure the highest level of safety and security for convention attendees, volunteers and the City of Milwaukee. In addition to the additional security enhancements we provided former President Trump\u2019s detail in June, we have also implemented changes to his security detail since Saturday to ensure his continued protection for the convention and the remainder of the campaign.\n\nThe Secret Service is tasked with the tremendous responsibility of protecting the current and former leaders of our democracy. It is a responsibility that I take incredibly seriously, and I am committed to fulfilling that mission.\u201d",

Vance, a relative newcomer to politics and fierce critic-turned-champion of the former president.\n\n\"As Vice President, J.D. will continue to fight for our Constitution, stand with our Troops, and will do everything he can to help me MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,\" Trump wrote in his social media announcement on Monday.\n\nJames David Vance, who is 39, is a Marine Corps veteran, author and former venture capitalist from Middletown, Ohio. He has represented the state in the U.S. Senate since January 2023.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe Yale Law School graduate and investment banker first rose to national prominence in 2016 with the publication of his memoir Hillbilly Elegy, a bestselling account of his upbringing \u2014 and the plight of the white working class \u2014 in Appalachia, plagued by poverty, abuse and addiction.\n\nThe book, which also faced its share of social and historical critiques, was adapted into a movie in 2020.\n\nVance went on to found \"Our Ohio Renewal,\" a since-shuttered nonprofit with focus areas including education and opioid addiction.\n\n\"The success of the book has given me the flexibility, but also I think the platform to talk about some of the issues that are most important to me,\" Vance told NPR in December 2016.\n\nThe organization dissolved in less than two years. Next, Vance co-founded a venture capital firm headquartered in Cincinnati and aimed at funding startups in underserved cities.\n\n\n\nJ.D. Vance's family\n\ntoggle caption Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n\nThe father of three is married to his Yale Law classmate Usha Chilukuri Vance, who has previously clerked for Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. of the U.S. Supreme Court, as well as Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Judge Amul Thapar.\n\nHe doesn't add much diversity to the Republican ticket by way of gender or race. But as a 39-year-old millennial, he is considerably younger than Trump \u2014 and most of the vice presidents who have held the position he's now seeking.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nVance, who turns 40 on August 2, would be one of the youngest vice presidents in U.S. history if elected.\n\nLoading...\n\nJ.D. Vance's time in the Senate\n\ntoggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nIn 2021, after months of hinting at his political ambitions, Vance launched his bid for the U.S. Senate.\n\nHe won a crowded primary race in May 2022 with the help of a last-minute endorsement from Trump, of whom he had once been unabashedly critical.\n\nVance went on to win the general election and assume his seat in the Senate, where he has been a leading defender of Trump and many of his policies, including opposing abortion rights and aid to Ukraine, calling for stronger border policies and downplaying the effects of climate change.\n\nIf Trump wins the presidency, Vance would have to resign his seat in the U.S. Senate \u2014 leaving an open spot in Ohio. In that case, it would fall to Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine to appoint his successor.\n\nUnder Ohio law, the governor appoints the person to fill a vacancy in the U.S. Senate until the next election, which would be in November 2026.\n\nJ.D. Vance's history on Trump\n\nVance made no secret of his dislike for then-candidate Trump while promoting his book in 2016, calling him such choice insults as \"noxious,\" \"cultural heroin\" and \"might be America's Hitler.\"\n\nIn an August 2016 interview on NPR's Fresh Air, Vance said he would either vote third party, \"hold my nose and vote for Hillary Clinton\" or \"write in my dog because that's about as good as it seems.\"\n\n\"But I think that I'm going to vote third party because I can't stomach Trump,\" he added. \"I think that he's noxious and is leading the white working class to a very dark place.\"\n\nBut Vance has dramatically changed his tune over the years, condemning his own criticisms as \u201cstupid\u201d on the campaign trail in 2022. Trump, who has called Vance a \u201cgenuine convert\u201d to his cause, seemed to put that checkered history behind them when he endorsed Vance in the primary that year.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cLike some others, J.D. Vance may have said some not so great things about me in the past, but he gets it now, and I have seen that in spades,\" Trump said. \"He is our best chance for victory in what could be a very tough race.\"\n\nVance has been a staunch defender of Trump during his time in the Senate, even showing up as a surrogate to the former president\u2019s hush money trial in New York.\n\nVance even went so far as to blame the rhetoric of the Biden administration for Trump\u2019s attempted assassination at a Pennsylvania rally over the weekend.\n\nJ.D. Vance, like Trump, denies 2020 election results\n\nIn Sen. J.D. Vance, former President Donald Trump has found a fellow election denier as his running mate \u2014 one who's already sown seeds of doubt about the upcoming presidential election.\n\nWhile running for the Senate in 2022, Vance said on the campaign trail that he thought the 2020 election was \u201cstolen from Trump.\u201d And earlier this year, Vance told ABC News he still questions the results of the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cDo I think there were problems in 2020? Yes, I do,\u201d he told George Stephanopoulos in February.\n\nVance, who at the time was being floated as a potential vice presidential nominee, also said that President Joe Biden\u2019s victory over Trump should not have been immediately certified.\n\n\"If I had been vice president, I would have told the states, like Pennsylvania, Georgia and so many others, that we needed to have multiple slates of electors and I think the U.S. Congress should have fought over it from there,\" Vance said. \"That is the legitimate way to deal with an election that a lot of folks, including me, think had a lot of problems in 2020. I think that's what we should have done.\"\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\nJ.D.

        "text": "Donald Trump: What are the other criminal cases the ex-president is facing?\nA judge has thrown out a case against Donald Trump in which the former president was accused of illegally holding on to classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.\n\nThe dismissal means two of the four criminal cases Trump had been facing have now been resolved - after the 78-year-old became the first ex-president to be criminally convicted when he was found guilty in his hush money trial in May.\n\nHere we take a look at the two remaining criminal cases facing Trump and the details of the two that have now come to an end.\n\nNeither of the two remaining criminal cases have trial dates set, making it unlikely they will start before the November election.\n\nJanuary 6 riot (criminal and civil)\n\nFollowing the January 6 riots at the US Capitol building, Trump was charged with conspiracy to defraud the US government and witness tampering in relation to his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election result.\n\nJack Smith, the special counsel behind the criminal case - who has a reputation for winning trials against war criminals, mobsters, and corrupt police officers - alleges the former president's lies \"fuelled\" the deadly insurrection in 2021.\n\nThe charges do not yet affect Trump from a practical standpoint, as nothing prevents criminal defendants from campaigning or taking office if they are convicted.\n\nHowever, how it will affect the US public's decision whether or not to vote for him is less clear.\n\nImage: A congressional committee has recommended Trump is indicted on four criminal charges\n\nTrump appeared in court in Washington DC in August 2023 and pleaded not guilty to the four charges against him.\n\nThey are: conspiracy to defraud the US; conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding; obstruction of, and attempt to obstruct, an official proceeding; and conspiracy against rights.\n\nThe trial had been due to start on 4 March 2024, but it was postponed and a new date has not yet been set.\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic politicians and police officers who defended the Capitol are seeking civil damages from Trump for harm they say they suffered during the insurrection, which aimed to stop Congress' certification of current president Joe Biden's victory.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:04 'I'm an innocent man,' Trump says\n\nGeorgia electoral fraud (criminal charges)\n\nTrump was formally booked on 13 charges at Georgia's Fulton County jail in August 2023, but three of the counts were later thrown out.\n\nWhile he was there, he had his mugshot and fingerprints taken before being released on bail.\n\nX X , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

But instead of accepting it, Trump set about a campaign to prove he was the rightful winner.\n\nClassified documents (criminal)\n\nTrump also faced charges over classified documents he allegedly took from the White House, including deleting CCTV footage of his staff moving boxes at his Florida home.\n\nHowever, a judge threw out this case against him on 15 July 2024.\n\nSpecial Counsel Jack Smith, who also charged Trump in relation to the 6 January Capitol riots, was leading the prosecution in relation to this case.\n\nHowever, Florida-based US District Aileen Cannon, who was nominated by Trump, agreed with the former president's defence lawyers that Mr Smith was unlawfully appointed to his role and did not have the authority to bring the case.\n\nThe judge also ruled that Mr Smith's office was improperly funded by the Justice Department.\n\nMr Smith's team vigorously contested the arguments made by Trump's defence team during hearings before Ms Cannon last month.\n\nTrump had been accused of risking some of the country's most sensitive security secrets by taking them from the Capitol to his Mar-a-Lago estate.\n\nDetails on the US nuclear weapons programmes, potential vulnerabilities of the US and its allies, and plans for retaliatory military attacks were in some of the documents, the federal indictment said.\n\nImage: Trump's home in Florida was raided in August last year\n\n'Hush money' (criminal)\n\nTrump was at the centre of a scheme to cover up \"hush money\" payments to buy the silence of a porn star in the days before the 2016 election.\n\nWhen revelations by Stormy Daniels of a sexual liaison with Trump threatened to upend his presidential campaign, he directed his lawyer to pay her $130,000 (\u00a3100,000) to keep her quiet.\n\nThe payment buried the story, and Trump was later elected to be the 45th president of the United States.\n\nIn a historic decision, a New York jury found him guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records to commit election fraud.\n\nImage: Pic: Steven Hirsch/pool via Reuters\n\nMs Daniels claimed she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006 and planned to sell her story 10 years later, just before the 2016 election.\n\nMichael Cohen, Trump's lawyer and fixer, testified that, upon learning that Ms Daniels planned to sell her story, Trump told him: \"This is a disaster, a total disaster. Women are going to hate me.\"\n\nPaying hush money is not illegal - the crime was the way in which Trump reimbursed Cohen and the reason the money was paid.\n\nAfter Trump was elected president, he repaid Cohen $420,000 (\u00a3324,000) which accounted for the $130,000 and other payments and bonuses, \"grossed up\" to account for tax liability.\n\nThe repayment was made in a series of cheques, which were recorded as legal expenses.\n\nThat was the crime - the falsification of business records, aggravated by the reason for it - the effort to conceal from voters a negative story that could have harmed Trump's election chances.\n\nThe former president was set to be sentenced on 11 July but this was later postponed until September,\n\nTrump faces a maximum sentence of four years in prison, though others convicted of the same crime often receive shorter sentences, fines or probation.\n\nFollow Sky News on WhatsApp Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky News Tap here\n\nHow has Trump tried to claim immunity in his cases?\n\nOn 1 July 2024, the US Supreme Court sent Trump's claim he is immune from prosecution for his actions while president back to a lower court.\n\nThis relates to the 6 January case, where while still president he encouraged his supporters to gather at Congress to oppose the approval of Mr Biden's 2020 election win.\n\nIn a historic 6-3 ruling, the justices said for the first time that former presidents have absolute immunity from prosecution for their official acts, but no immunity for unofficial acts.\n\nBut instead of deciding for themselves, the justices ordered lower courts to work out precisely how to apply their decision to Trump's case.\n\nThe lower court must now decide whether he was acting officially or privately.\n\nIt comes months after a US appeal court ruled in February that Trump does not have presidential immunity and could be prosecuted in relation to the Capitol riots case.\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nWhat about the civil cases?\n\nIn addition to the criminal cases, Trump has also fought two civil cases - where another party that is not the state brings him to court.\n\nIn May 2023 a jury in New York concluded that he sexually assaulted writer E Jean Carroll and then defamed her. He was ordered to make one payment to her of $5m (\u00a33.9m) and a second of $83.3m (\u00a364m).\n\nIn February 2024 he was fined $354.9m (\u00a3274m) by a judge in New York for inflating his wealth in order to secure easier terms on bank loans. He called the judgment a \"manifest injustice\".",

        "text": "US election risks and the impact of Trump\u2019s re-election odds on financial markets\nThe US presidential election that decides between Joe Biden and Donald Trump takes place on 5 November 2024. Platforms and personas of both candidates offer ample reasons for markets, as well as specific segments within them, to react to news in anticipation of the probable outcome of the vote. The candidates\u2019 agendas differ in key aspects, for instance regarding energy, fiscal, and trade policy: Biden plans to reinforce the US green transition and increase taxation on corporations and high earners; Trump plans to strongly reduce environmental spending, introduce incentives for more domestic oil and gas production, and reduce tax rates. Moreover, Trump has already proposed to tighten the US tariff policy, especially toward China, even beyond the recently introduced tariffs on goods connected to clean energy, semiconductors and metals. These differences imply uncertainty in future policies in key economic areas. As the gap in the polls between the two candidates is not large (Figure 1), there is ample room for markets to form and update views on most likely outcomes; as shown in Rodden et al. (2020), the combination of close elections and polarisation brings about large increases in economic policy uncertainty in the US.\n\nFigure 1 US electoral polls calculated as averages across pollsters (data in per cent)\n\nSource: Bloomberg. Last observation: 1 July 2024.\n\nWe show that election-related uncertainty is indeed increasingly priced in futures contracts. Equity markets expect an increase in volatility around the election date. Bilateral exchange rates vis-\u00e0-vis the dollar also feature a higher expected volatility around the election date, especially for currencies of countries more exposed to the risk of a tariff war and tightened immigration policies in the case of a Trump re-election.\n\nWe then set up a daily structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model to estimate the effects of the increase in the probability of a Trump re-election on a wide set of financial variables, finding that the response of most indicators is consistent with Trump\u2019s proposed policies: more market-oriented, less environmentally friendly and less tilted on public debt sustainability. Our contribution, using financial instruments to gauge investors\u2019 assessment of political risk and exploring its implications from a macro-finance standpoint, fits in the literature on the effects of political uncertainty on financial markets (Moramarco et al. 2020, P\u00e1stor et al. 2014, Veronesi and P\u00e1stor 2017).\n\nVolatility related to the US election\n\nFirst, we describe some stylised facts on the volatility in financial markets around the next US election date, an approach inspired by the analysis of Kelly et al. (2016). Equity markets are expecting an increase in volatility around the election date. Compared to the Obama-Romney (2012) and Clinton-Trump (2016) electoral competitions, US election risk has emerged earlier. Since March 2024, futures contracts tied to the VIX \u2014 measuring expectations of near-term swings in the S&P 500 equities benchmark \u2014 have been pricing-in a rise in market volatility in October (with respect to previous months) and a fall after the election date in November (Figure 2). The same dynamics of expected volatility stood out in 2020, when Biden and Trump first competed for the presidency. Instead, in 2012 and 2016, markets started to expect a comparable rise in volatility in October only three months before the elections, and they did not anticipate a fall in November.\n\nFigure 2 Implied volatility in equity markets (in percentage points): Comparison across electoral years\n\nNote: The figure shows the differences between the price of futures contracts on the VIX expiring in two consecutive months. The futures contract expiring on a given date captures the implied volatility over the subsequent 30 days.\n\nSource: Refinitiv. Last observation: 1 July 2024.\n\nCurrency markets (FX) also expect high foreign exchange volatility around the US vote. To measure this phenomenon, we take the implied volatility extracted from options expiring in six months (i.e. after the elections) on the US dollar exchange rate to the main currencies, minus the implied volatility extracted from the same options expiring in three months: a positive difference emerging in the latest months (from May 2024 onwards) reveals expectations of an increase in foreign exchange volatility close to the election date. Expected foreign exchange volatility around the US elections is particularly pronounced for the Chinese yuan, the country more exposed to the risks of a potential tariff war (Figure 3). Nonetheless, the expected increase in volatility for the euro and the sterling vis-\u00e0-vis the dollar has also been on the rise since May. A possible rationalisation of these results is that a Trump victory arguably implies a more protectionist trade policy: Trump has already proposed a 10% import tariff across-the-board and supposedly he is also considering a 60% tariff on imports from China.\n\nFigure 3 Implied volatility in currency markets (data in percentage points)\n\nNote: difference between the implied volatility extracted from the six-month and three-month options on USD bilateral exchange rates.\n\nSource: Refinitiv. Last observation: 1 July 2024.\n\nEffects of a likely Trump re-election on financial markets\n\nTo assess the impact of an increased likelihood of a Trump re-election on financial markets, we estimate a nine variable, daily VAR model on the 3 January 2023 to 1 July 2024 period. We include the following variables: the Citigroup US macro surprises index to control for the state of the economy; the logarithm of Trump\u2019s election likelihood, computed as the ratio between the voting intention for Trump and that for Biden, which is our key variable of interest; the logarithm of the Brent oil price; the logarithm of the Move (which measures bond market volatility); the logarithm of the VIX (which measures equity market volatility); the ten-year government bond yield; the logarithm of the S&P500; the logarithm of the US nominal effective exchange rate (NEER; an increase denotes a US dollar appreciation); and inflation expectations (five-year, five-year forward inflation expectations).\n\nWe identify a shock to Trump\u2019s election likelihood using a recursive ordering based on short-run zero restrictions (Cholesky decomposition) with Trump\u2019s election probability ordered second after US macro surprises. The identifying assumption is that the Trump\u2019s election likelihood is cleansed by the daily changes in US macro surprises because those may lead voters to revise their decisions in the polls while, conversely, these surprises are exogenous with respect to election odds. We further assume that financial markets can respond to elections odds within the same day whereas election odds may be affected by financial developments only with a lag.\n\nWe find that a one standard deviation shock to Trump\u2019s election likelihood, which corresponds to an increase in the odds by about 0.6% on impact (Figure 4), leads to an increase in the volatility of the US bond market: this might suggest that markets are pricing-in a higher credit risk, perhaps because of expectations of higher budget deficits should Trump be elected. Instead, a higher probability of Trump\u2019s election is associated with a lower equity market volatility and higher stock prices, which is coherent with the more pro-market attitude of the Republican candidate.\n\nFigure 4 Effect of an increase in Trump\u2019s election likelihood\n\nNotes: This figure shows daily impulse response functions and 68-90% confidence intervals. Responses are in per cent, except for the ten-year yield (percentage points), and economic news (index).\n\nThe shock also leads to lower oil prices in line with higher expected supply of fossil fuels, likely reflecting Trump\u2019s scant interest in environmental matters, his scepticism of renewable energy, and a positive attitude toward strengthening the domestic commodity industry. Finally, the effects on the exchange rate and inflation expectations point to a small depreciation of the US dollar.\n\nIn a different specification we also include, one by one, the stock indices for individual sectors. We find the semiconductors, software, and defence-related industries to be the sectors most positively affected by a higher Trump likelihood of re-election. Probably, these are the strategic sectors that will benefit more from a higher degree of protectionism under a new Trump administration. We also estimate a model including corporate spreads (both on investment grade and high-yield bonds) and find that an increased likelihood of Trump\u2019s election leads to higher spreads. This might be perhaps the result of expectations of higher budget deficits, increasing perceived risk in the sovereign segment and inducing a repricing of corporate bonds, consistent with our baseline results.\n\nFigure 5 Trump\u2019s shocks retrieved from the structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model\n\nLast, we check whether the identified shock captures relevant news concerning the unfolding of the electoral competition. We plot the series and label some of the largest identified shocks (Figure 5). These spikes correspond to news concerning either the Republican campaign (when Ron DeSantis dropped out the presidential race in January 2024), or Trump\u2019s legal issues (his arrest in August 2023, and news about the fine concerning a fraud case in January 2024).\n\nAuthors\u2019 note: The opinions expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Bank of Italy.\n\nReferences\n\nKelly, B, L P\u00e1stor and P Veronesi (2016), \u201cThe Price of Political Uncertainty: Theory and Evidence from the Option Market\u201d, Journal of Finance 71(5): 2417-2480.\n\nMoramarco, G, G Trigilia and P Manasse (2020), \u201cPolitical risk and exchange rates: The lessons of Brexit\u201d, VoxEU.org, 17 February.\n\nP\u00e1stor, L, P Veronesi and B Kelly (2014), \u201cThe price of political uncertainty\u201d, VoxEU.org, 31 March.\n\nRodden, J, S Davis, A Baksy, N Bloom and S Baker (2020), \u201cPolarised elections raise economic uncertainty\u201d, VoxEU.org, 22 December.\n\nVeronesi, P and L P\u00e1stor (2017), \u201cExplaining the puzzle of high uncertainty and low market volatility\u201d, VoxEU.org, 25 May.",

        "text": "Who is JD Vance, Trump\u2019s vice-presidential pick?\nDonald Trump has selected JD Vance, the junior senator of Ohio and author of the bestselling memoir Hillbilly Elegy, as his running mate in the presidential race.\n\nThe announcement, made on Monday during the first day of the Republican national convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, marked the culmination of Vance\u2019s stunning political evolution over the past several years.\n\nVance was once an outspoken critic of Trump, mocking him as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Hitler\u201d and \u201ca total fraud\u201d. But Vance came to embrace Trump as he sought a Senate seat in 2022, and he eventually won the former president\u2019s endorsement in a crowded Republican primary.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the guy that said some bad shit about me,\u201d Trump said at a rally in 2022. \u201cIf I went by that standard, I don\u2019t think I would have ever endorsed anybody in the country.\u201d\n\nVance echoed that assessment, telling rally-goers, \u201cThe president is right. I wasn\u2019t always nice, but the simple fact is, he\u2019s the best president of my lifetime, and he revealed the corruption in this country like nobody else.\u201d\n\n2:09 JD Vance: from 'never-Trump guy' to vice-presidential candidate \u2013 video profile\n\nVance first rose to fame in 2016 following the publication of Hillbilly Elegy, which detailed his upbringing in south-western Ohio and his later ascension to Yale law school. The book was later adapted into a 2020 film starring Glenn Close and Amy Adams.\n\nIn the months following Trump\u2019s victory in the 2016 presidential election, Vance\u2019s account of his family\u2019s experiences with poverty and drug addiction came to be viewed by some critics as a revealing portrait into the lives of Americans who helped determine the outcome of the election.\n\n\u201cIt dropped into a national shouting match that has pitted a hazily defined entity called \u2018the white working class\u2019 against an equally hazy \u2018coastal elite\u2019 as the Sunni and Shia of the American political scene,\u201d the author Hari Kunzru wrote for the Guardian in 2016. \u201cReaders looking to understand the class fault lines within white America will be enlightened by Vance\u2019s narrative of class mobility, but as a guide to the new political terrain Hillbilly Elegy is uneven, and frustratingly silent about the writer\u2019s real commitments.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen JD Vance speaks to the crowd at a rally held by Donald Trump in Youngstown, Ohio, on 17 September 2022. Photograph: Gaelen Morse/Reuters\n\nOnce Trump took office, Vance became an oft-cited conservative voice frequently called upon to explain the president\u2019s political brand to baffled cable news viewers. Vance was initially viewed as an anti-Trump Republican, as a CNN analysis found that he liked many tweets that were harshly critical of the then president in 2016 and 2017.\n\nBut that tone sharply shifted once Vance entered the 2022 Senate race, as he shaped his campaign around hard-right proposals like finishing the wall along the US-Mexico border. During the election, Democrats accused Vance of endorsing the racist conspiracy theory known as \u201cGreat Replacement\u201d after he suggested the opposing party was attempting to \u201ctransform the electorate\u201d amid an immigrant \u201cinvasion\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking about a shift in the democratic makeup of this country that would mean we never win, meaning Republicans would never win a national election in this country ever again,\u201d Vance told voters in 2022.\n\nVance\u2019s hard-right tactics were ultimately successful, as he defeated Democrat representative Tim Ryan by six points in the election. In the year and a half since he joined Congress, Vance has served as one of Trump\u2019s most vocal and aggressive supporters on Capitol Hill. After the assassination attempt against Trump on Saturday, Vance accused Joe Biden of inciting the attack.\n\n\u201cToday is not just some isolated incident,\u201d Vance posted on X. \u201cThe central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump\u2019s attempted assassination.\u201d\n\nAs Trump\u2019s running mate, Vance will now have a much larger platform to spread that message.",

        "text": "Vice presidential nominee Vance calls China 'biggest threat to our country'\nIn his short time in the U.S. Senate, J.D. Vance, the newly tapped Republican vice presidential nominee, has been a hawk on China.\n\nHe has introduced legislation to restrict Chinese access to U.S. financial markets and to protect U.S. higher education from Chinese influence.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News shortly after being named as former President Donald Trump\u2019s running mate on Monday, Vance called China \u201cthe biggest threat\u201d to the United States.\n\nWhen asked about Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, Vance said Trump would negotiate with Moscow and Kyiv to \u201cbring this thing to a rapid close so America can focus on the real issue, which is China.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the biggest threat to our country and we are completely distracted from it,\u201d said Vance, a staunch supporter of Trump\u2019s Make America Great Again agenda.\n\nThe 39-year-old author and venture capitalist rose to fame with his 2016 memoir \u201cHillbilly Elegy.\u201d He advocates for a hands-off approach to foreign policy and is dubious about military intervention.\n\nTariffs and more tariffs\n\nBoth Trump and Vance have supported strong tariffs on China. In an interview with CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d news program in May, Vance said the U.S. needs to apply across-the-board tariffs on imports.\n\n\u201cIf you apply tariffs, really what it is you're saying [is] that we're going to penalize you for using slave labor in China and importing that stuff in the United States. What you end up doing is, you end up making more stuff in America, in Pennsylvania, in Ohio and in Michigan,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump has repeatedly accused China of stealing manufacturing jobs from the U.S., especially those jobs in the Midwestern part of the country.\n\n\u201cVance has supported more economic restrictions and tariffs on Chinese imports and investments,\u201d Dean Chen, a professor of political science at the Ramapo College of New Jersey, told VOA. \u201cHence, I expect his position on China to be in line with Trump nationalists in their potential new administration.\u201d\n\nTrump has promised that, if elected, he would impose 10% across-the-board levies on imported goods and a tariff of 60% or higher on Chinese goods to protect American industries.\n\nJoel Goldstein, professor emeritus of law at Saint Louis University and an expert on the vice presidency, said Vance was selected because he is \u201ca very loyal supporter who has embraced Trump's policies and style and who seems disposed to defend Trump's words and conduct.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe choice seems designed to appeal to Trump's MAGA base, not to unify the Republican Party or the nation,\u201d he told VOA.\n\nTaiwan\n\nExperts say Vance might be more of an isolationist than Trump, as Vance was vehemently opposed to funding the war in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cHe previously served as a U.S. Marine in Iraq and felt that the lessons from that war should prevent future entanglements,\u201d Chen said.\n\nChen added that whether that attitude translates to lessened support for a Taiwan military contingency remains to be seen.\n\n\u201cWe all know that Trump has been clear that he won't announce whether he would send troops to help Taiwan should Beijing invade the island democracy, saying that a lucid explanation would undercut his negotiating position,\u201d he said. \u201cI expect Vance to toe the same line as President Trump.\u201d\n\nAttracting Rust Belt voters\n\nVance was born on August 2, 1984, in Middletown, Ohio. He served in the Marine Corps before attending The Ohio State University and Yale Law School.\n\nHis 2016 bestselling memoir, \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d detailed his family\u2019s struggles with poverty, addiction and instability. The book focuses on the hardship faced by white working-class people in the Rust Belt \u2014 the manufacturing region in the U.S. that includes parts of the Northeast and Midwest and has experienced economic decline and population loss.\n\n\u201cSenator Vance\u2019s life story and diverse accomplishments are impressive,\u201d Karen Hult, a political science professor at Virginia Tech, told VOA.\n\n\u201cHe not only is from a \u2018red\u2019 Republican state, but one that is near the battleground state of Pennsylvania and may be seen as appealing to many more rural and smaller town residents in much of the Middle West,\u201d Hult said.\n\nIn the 2020 presidential election, Trump lost Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, three important swing states along the Rust Belt.\n\nHult said that in most presidential elections, the choice of running mates makes little difference in voting results.\n\n\u201cThat, of course, may differ in 2024, given the age of the two major party candidates and in light of Saturday's assassination attempt,\u201d she added.",

        "text": "FACT SHEET: President Biden\u2019s Presidential Proclamation and Joint DHS-DOJ Interim Final Rule Cut Encounters at Southwest Border by Over 50 Percent in Six Weeks\nThe Presidential Proclamation issued by President Biden to temporarily suspend the entry of certain noncitizens across the Southern border \u2013 including the southwest land and southern coastal borders \u2013 and the complementary joint interim final rule (IFR) issued by DHS and DOJ have now been in effect for six weeks, helping reduce the number of encounters at our Southwest Border by more than 50 percent. The Border Patrol\u2019s 7-day average has decreased to below 1,900 encounters per day. In June, the Border Patrol recorded 83,536 encounters between ports of entry, the lowest number since January 2021, and below the number of encounters between ports of entry in June 2019, the last comparable year prior to the pandemic.\n\nWhile the President\u2019s action has led to significant results, our nation\u2019s immigration system requires Congressional action to provide needed resources and durable authorities. Twice now, Congress has failed to pass the bipartisan border security agreement negotiated in the U.S. Senate, which would provide the critical personnel and funding needed to further secure our Southern border. The agreement would have added 1,500 U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Agents and Officers, added 1,200 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) personnel, 4,300 asylum officers, invested in technology to catch illegal fentanyl, and delivered sweeping reforms to the asylum system. Congress must still act.\n\nWhile the Proclamation and IFR have been in effect:\n\nDHS has removed and returned more than 50,000 individuals to more than 100 countries, including by operating more than 175 international repatriation flights.\n\nDHS has doubled the percentage of noncitizens removed or returned directly from CBP custody.\n\nDHS has doubled the percentage of noncitizens processed through Expedited Removal while in CBP or ICE custody. Expedited Removal processing was already at record levels prior to the Declaration.\n\nDHS has decreased the number of people released pending their removal proceedings by 70 percent.\n\nWe continue to implement recently announced measures to increase the overall capacity of enforcement resources \u2014 including repatriation flights and detention capacity. ICE is optimizing air charter contracts to maximize the number of repatriation flights operated each week.\n\nOver the last year, the agency has removed individuals to a range of South American and Eastern Hemisphere countries, including Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Egypt, Mauritania, Senegal, Uzbekistan, and India, and in the last two weeks, DHS conducted a removal flight to the PRC. Efforts to expand the number of removal flights continue with the expectation of additional flights added to the schedule in the coming weeks.\n\nUnder the terms of the IFR, the limitation on asylum eligibility will be discontinued when encounters fall below certain levels but will come back into effect if encounters rise again. This is how the IFR was designed \u2013 as an action for when encounters exceed the ability of our system to deliver timely consequences. The Proclamation and IFR enable DHS to quickly remove those without a legal basis to remain, strengthening enforcement consequences for those who fail to use lawful pathways to come to the United States. For more information on how the Proclamation and IFR work, visit the following links:\n\nIndividuals continue to be eligible for asylum, including individuals who use the CBP One\u2122 mobile app\u2019s appointment scheduling function. CBP makes 1,450 appointments available per day at eight land ports of entry via this functionality. Use of the app requires those seeking an appointment to submit vital information in advance, improving DHS\u2019s ability to conduct screening and vetting. CBP One is just one example of how this Administration has carried out the largest expansion of lawful pathways and orderly processes in decades.\n\nThe majority of all Southwest border encounters during the past three fiscal years resulted in a removal, return, or expulsion. DHS removed or returned over 740,000 individuals in the 12 months after the end of the Title 42 public health Order, more than any year since 2010. This has included more removals to countries other than Mexico than in any prior year ever.\n\nFor additional information on the actions taken over the past three years to strengthen border security, see our fact sheet at the link below:\n\n###",

The country\u2019s European orientation, backed by a national consensus according to recent polls, reflects citizens\u2019 desire for stability, prosperity, and a strengthened rule of law\u2014all of which they perceive as more accessible within the European Union. At the same time, Russia aims to thwart Moldova\u2019s pro-European aspirations and keep the country under its influence through interference in electoral processes and hybrid warfare tactics. In the context of Russia\u2019s hybrid war against Europe, the next 15 months will be crucial for Moldova.\n\nThe presidential election and referendum on European integration in October 2024 and the parliamentary election in 2025 will be the first voting since the EU Commission decided to open accession negotiations with Chi\u0219in\u0103u. These elections will play an important role in determining Moldova\u2019s path and testing the country\u2019s internal resilience in the face of external pressures. They are crucial not only for Moldova but also for its international partners, who need to assess and adjust their aid, whether it be technical assistance, economic support, or security cooperation.\n\nRussia attempted to wreak havoc on Moldova\u2019s democratic process in last year\u2019s races, and there is ample reason to believe that the Kremlin will do the same during this year\u2019s and next year\u2019s campaigns. Moldova is again likely to find itself organizing and conducting elections while countering strenuous efforts to destabilize them.",

        "text": "Berkeley scholar warns U.S. liberals: Either get tough, or get ready to lose\nRepeatedly in the last three weeks, political events have caught Democrats off-guard and put them on their heels: President Joe Biden\u2019s disastrous performance in a debate with challenger Donald Trump, a disappointing Biden interview, and, on Saturday, the attempted assassination of Trump. While the Democrats have been mired in uncertainty and defensiveness, Trump, even bloodied, has projected fiery energy.\n\nFor UC Berkeley political scientist M. Steven Fish, this anxious moment is the culmination of several decades since liberals ceded the art of political combat to the right. In a new book, Comeback (Rivertowns Books, May 2024), Fish offers a deeply provocative and often devastating critique of the left\u2019s timorous approach to political communication.\n\nAnd, he writes, if progressives don\u2019t muscle up \u2014 now \u2014 then democracy itself could be lost.\n\nM. Steven Fish\n\nFish\u2019s analysis is openly partisan, a sort of tough-love message to his allies. He grew up in Kentucky, and he has a lived understanding of the heartland and working-class values that sometimes escapes progressive leaders on the coasts and in major urban centers. He\u2019s written extensively about democracy and its opponents, in the U.S. and globally.\n\nHis data-based critique centers on a couple of core ideas, both of them counterintuitive: First, the left needs to embrace a positive patriotism. It needs an overarching story of how liberal values across centuries have advanced power and opportunity for women, people of color, immigrants and young people, and defended the poor and working classes against predatory capitalism.\n\nSecond, Fish says, because that progress is always under attack from the right, liberals and their leaders need to renew their commitment to what he calls \u201cthe politics of dominance.\u201d\n\nVoters \u201cwant to be on the winning team,\u201d he writes. \u201cThey favor leaders who project indomitability rather than vulnerability. They admire and trust leaders with stiff spines and strong principles. In a word, people gravitate toward high-dominance leaders.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Berkeley News, Fish detailed how dominance politics and capturing the flag can win elections and advance a more just, compassionate society.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nBerkeley News: The country is still coming to grips with the shooting that wounded President Donald Trump at a campaign rally a few days ago. Does this event change how Democrats should approach the campaign, especially since they were already struggling in the aftermath of the last presidential debate?\n\nM. Steven Fish: The assassination attempt might give Trump a small bump in the polls, but that will probably pass and likely won\u2019t affect the Democrats\u2019 overall strategy.\n\nDonald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, gestures fiercely to the crowd after a bullet grazed his ear during a campaign stop in Pennsylvania. Gene J. Puskar, Associated Press\n\nAs ever, winning elections is about appealing to values and emotions more than material interests. Voters favor candidates who seem like the most powerful leaders and who make them feel best about themselves and their country.\n\nThe Democrats have lost track of this fact. They are doing what they always do these days, which is running on the issues, even though there\u2019s no evidence that that approach is moving the needle. They also have an unfortunate tendency towards defeatism, which is now coming to the fore as they assume recent events will assure Trump\u2019s victory. This pessimism is completely unwarranted, extremely damaging and must be shut down.\n\nTrump is a singularly disliked figure, and history shows us that whatever polling bump he gets from recent events like the assassination attempt will probably pass.\n\nEverything we hold dear is on the line. Liberals need to start messaging and fighting like we get this fact. The task at hand for the Democrats is rooting their messages in compelling narratives that establish their reputations as patriots, unifiers of the nation and guardians of national values.\n\nIf they\u2019re going to change the game and defeat Trump, they\u2019re going to have to adopt what I call high-dominance messaging and an emotionally compelling brand of liberal nationalism.\n\nWe\u2019re a few weeks out from the debate between Biden and Trump that transformed the 2024 presidential election, and maybe changed U.S. history. As a critic of Democratic communication tactics, what have you been focusing on as this plays out?\n\nThroughout his presidency, Biden has been playing, for the most part, a low-dominance game. Now, with his back against the wall and his own partisans urging him to step down, he\u2019s actually stepping up his dominance game. He\u2019s saying, \u201cI\u2019ll see you at the convention. Try to take me out there.\u201d That\u2019s exactly how he\u2019s supposed to act every day.\n\nIt\u2019s remarkable that he\u2019s only doing this out of desperation. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to work, but frankly, that\u2019s the right attitude. There\u2019s a very good argument for stepping aside, but if he\u2019s going to stay in, the best way to surmount the age problem is to play a high-dominance political game. After all, the reason that his age is a problem is that it makes him look feeble.\n\nPeople favor leaders who they regard as strong, as capable of mastering their political opponents. If you look at the data, what you\u2019ll find is that the candidates who are regarded as more knowledgeable win about half the time. Candidates who are regarded as \u201ccaring more about people like me\u201d win about half the time. The candidates who were viewed as the stronger leader? They rarely lose.\n\n\u2018High dominance\u2019 is such a provocative term, and maybe open to misinterpretation. Can you sketch out how it might work in practice?\n\nThe concept of dominance might seem illiberal to us, and it\u2019s especially challenging for some liberals now because Trump is so high-dominance \u2014 in fact, dominance is all he\u2019s got. He\u2019s a charging alpha chimp. He\u2019s sexist and abusive and bellicose and arrogant and everything else we hate.\n\nThe Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was an archetypal \u201chigh-dominance\u201d communicator, says political scientist M. Steven Fish. King took the moral high ground, was unsparing with opponents, and offered an inspired vision of America\u2019s potential greatness. bswise via Flickr\n\nBut Democrats and liberals have their own high-dominance tradition. Frederick Douglass, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Martin Luther King \u2014 these are extraordinarily high-dominance leaders. They strove to make opinion, rather than just reading polls. They were risk-accepting rather than risk-averse. They played to win and win big, not just to avoid loss. They sometimes used provocative, transgressive language. They strove to thrill people, to inspire people, not just appeal to their material interests.\n\n\u201cOwn\u201d the libs? Nobody ever owned FDR, JFK or MLK. And can you imagine Lyndon Johnson having accomplished what he did, this historic legacy of progressive reform, without his high-dominance style? We need to recover that tradition.\n\nRoosevelt was first elected president in 1932, nearly 100 years ago. Tell me how he practiced high-dominance politics and captured the flag.\n\nFormer U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt used powerful patriotic and moral arguments to overcome political opposition and guide the nation through the Depression and World War II, writes Berkeley scholar M. Steven Fish. Photo by Leon A. Perskie\n\nHere\u2019s an example: He gave a campaign speech right before the 1936 election. He\u2019s talking about everything he\u2019s done to reduce taxes on working people and raise taxes on the wealthy. One by one, after every item on that list, he asks: \u201cWasn\u2019t that the American thing to do?\u201d\n\nThen he says: \u201cIn this election, we have a choice. Are we going to turn our tax policy back over to privilege? I know the American answer to that question.\u201d\n\nHe tethered his progressive programs to the flag. And he honored the pride of working folks. What do the Democrats do today? They throw a pity party for working-class Americans.\n\nIn another speech he gave just before his first reelection, FDR invited the plutocrats\u2019 hatred and added: \u201cI should like to have it said of my first administration that in it the forces of selfishness and of lust for power met their match. I should like to have it said of my second administration that in it these forces met their master.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s winning language that excites your base, attracts swing voters and earns respect.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that Democrats have been struggling to connect with heartland voters, especially white working-class voters. In your view, how could they overcome that problem?\n\nWe tell this story about how the working person is desperate. Listen to the rhetoric: \u201cYou poor, struggling working families. We\u2019re here to get you a break so you can squeeze by.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t work for the folks where I grew up, and it doesn\u2019t work very well anywhere else, either. Working class people, like everyone else, want to be regarded as prosperous, as forward-looking, as self-reliant and living lives that are full of possibility. The Democrats\u2019 message often ignores the human need for respect.\n\nSo if you were to reengineer that message, what does it look like?\n\nIf the truth-tellers can\u2019t present their message with greater verve and chutzpah than the other side \u2026 their opponents\u2019 lies are going to be accepted as truth. M. Steven Fish\n\nVoters vote for leaders who actually inspire them. They vote for people who make them feel great about their country and future prospects. They vote for leaders who they regard as strong commanders, who can really take it to the other side.\n\nPeople do not vote based on infrastructure spending. Strong political leaders know that they can talk about policies, but they wrap their policies in a captivating story about our country, about showing the world what we\u2019re made of.\n\nAgain, though \u2014 Trump inspires people. His base sees him as strong. Should Democrats somehow mirror his tactics?\n\nAbsolutely not. Democrats need to overmatch Trump\u2019s dominance, not emulate his style. If you look at the news over the last eight years, every time I open cnn.com or read the New York Times or watch Fox News, it\u2019s all Trump all the time. Why? Because Trump is provocative. He says interesting things. He doesn\u2019t seem to give a damn what people think. He tells you what he believes and what he wants you to believe, not what he thinks you want to hear.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris Photo by Adam Schultz / Biden for President via Flickr\n\nThat\u2019s what makes news. That\u2019s what gets clicks. That\u2019s what earns respect. That\u2019s his superpower.\n\nWhen Harris and Biden can\u2019t even make the headlines, it\u2019s because they\u2019re so boring. Democrats gnash their teeth and say, \u201cWhy don\u2019t people care about policies? That\u2019s what they should be voting on.\u201d\n\nBut we live in an age of infotainment and public addiction to spectacle. If the truth-tellers can\u2019t present their message with greater verve and chutzpah than the other side, they\u2019re not going to be heard. They\u2019re going to lose, and their opponents\u2019 lies are going to be accepted as truth.\n\nBut isn\u2019t it inevitable that many people might equate the politics of dominance with an anti-democratic impulse? They might think it sounds very close to \u201cthe politics of testosterone.\u201d\n\nPolitics is always a blood sport \u2026 now, more than ever. If you\u2019re squeamish about dominating your opponents, you shouldn\u2019t be in this game. M. Steven Fish\n\nThere is nothing illiberal about dominance politics. Dominance is about having the courage of your convictions. It\u2019s about leading rather than just following polls. Taking risks. Being on the offense all the time. Opponents are supposed to be offended. Democrats are so concerned about being offensive that they can\u2019t rouse their own followers.\n\nLook, we\u2019re at war here. Politics is always a blood sport to some extent \u2014 but right now, more than ever. If you\u2019re squeamish about dominating your opponents, you shouldn\u2019t be in this game.\n\nLet me put it another way: As a matter of fundamental character, it seems to me that liberals, progressives, are deeply wary of dominance \u2014 it\u2019s almost antithetical. They\u2019re much more about compassion, collaboration, building consensus. About sharing power equally and respectfully as a basic principle of human relationships.\n\nAnd when you suggest that this could be seen as a politics of testosterone \u2014 in fact, dominance is absolutely not a male thing, still less a toxically male thing. Some of the strongest, most high-dominance politicians right now are women. They\u2019re leading the way in many respects.\n\nKaja Kallas, prime minister of Estonia kmu.gov.ua via Wikimedia Commons\n\nThere is absolutely no contradiction between collaboration, cooperation and empathy on the one hand and dominance politics on the other. FDR, JFK and LBJ, to take just three examples, were very high on those qualities. They were also high-dominance politicians.\n\nKaja Kallas, the prime minister of Estonia \u2014 she\u2019s young, she\u2019s female. She\u2019s taking it to Vladimir Putin. She\u2019s taking it to her own ethno-nationalists at home in Estonia, and she\u2019s beating them in elections. They\u2019ve got their own Trump, and she just kicked his butt.\n\nSanna Marin, former prime minister of Finland, is another one.\n\nHow about in the U.S.?\n\nJasmine Crockett, a member of Congress from Texas \u2014 I\u2019ve got a whole chapter about her in Comeback. She is a high-dominance archetype. And Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker of the House, obviously.\n\nDominance is just a tool \u2014 it can be used for good or ill. Right now the Republicans are using it for corrupt, unpatriotic, anti-democratic, anti-American ends. We can use it to promote decency, democracy and equality. When the bad guys are seen as stronger than the good guys, we\u2019re in trouble.\n\nYou just mentioned patriotism \u2014 let\u2019s talk about that. One of the most striking ideas in Comeback is that liberals, over the last half-century, have made a grave error by abandoning patriotism and rejecting nationalism. In essence, you say, they\u2019ve ceded the flag to the right, at great cost.\n\nTo reject patriotism and claim that you should be in charge of the country is a complete contradiction.\n\nImagine someone who\u2019s interviewing for a top job at a firm. Now, if that candidate does not show you that he or she is on fire with excitement about the company\u2019s potential, its accomplishments, but instead frets over the firm\u2019s many liabilities and its failures, are they going to get the job?\n\nWhen I hear people say that they don\u2019t like patriotism, what they\u2019re saying, basically, is they think they\u2019re better than Thomas Jefferson and Frederick Douglass and Ida B. Wells and Martin Luther King and John F. Kennedy and the masses of ordinary Americans who have lived and died to keep the country free and make it better. Most people everywhere are proud of and grateful for their citizenship, and they want leaders who are as enthusiastic about the country as they are.\n\nAs you describe it, MAGA and illiberal forces have an overarching story that\u2019s engaging and inspiring, even if it\u2019s based on tribal resentment and, often, on lies. In a nutshell, \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d But you write that liberals in the U.S. don\u2019t have such a story of national greatness \u2014 and that\u2019s a weakness, because such stories are essential to unite and inspire a strong political movement.\n\nWe\u2019ve got a choice here: On the one hand, you have a cramped ethno-national version of the country that defines America largely as a native-born, white Christian entity. On the other side, you have a vision of a country that includes all of its citizens. We\u2019re all in this together. We\u2019re all equal, regardless of the recentness of our immigration, regardless of our ethnicity, where we came from, how we worship.\n\nRight-wing militants raised a cross outside of the state capitol in Lansing, Mich., on Jan. 6, 2021. They objected to the certification of election results that brought Democrat Joe Biden to the White House. Adam J. Dewey/NurPhoto via Associated Press\n\nIf you\u2019re good with the ethno-national version, just leave the flag in their hands. But if you would prefer a country where everybody\u2019s treated equally, everybody\u2019s citizenship is honored, and we\u2019re all in this together, then you better take the flag the hell back from the ethno-nationalists.\n\nThe problem is, if you wave a flag these days, or if you put a flag bumper sticker on your car, if you wear a T-shirt with the flag on it, people will suspect you of being MAGA. When you get to that point, you are in big, big trouble.\n\nSo what would you suggest as a liberal alternative to MAGA\u2019s ethno-nationalist story of greatness?\n\nSomething like this:\n\nThe United States was founded for the purpose of self-government, and our history has largely been an effort to expand the blessings of liberty to larger and larger groups of Americans. Finally, in 1965, we became a full democracy when African Americans in the South got the right to vote. That\u2019s who we are as Democrats.\n\nThis country has its faults. We have a horrific history of racial oppression. But look at the incredible progress we\u2019ve made, from the heinousness of slavery, to the idiocy of Jim Crow, to the mighty mind of Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThat\u2019s what we Democrats are about.\n\nMartin Luther King was a first-class nationalist. The way he talked about the United States was remarkable. He was forever talking about our great nation, America moving on to its greatness, and telling these glorious stories about American progress, while never ignoring its past failures and current challenges. That\u2019s what made his message so appealing and opened the hearts of so many people.\n\nDemocrats today are afraid of raucously celebrating progress. But you\u2019ve got to do that. Liberals often think it will sound offensive to those who still suffer. But the country has made enormous progress. And if you want to inspire your voters, you have to constantly hold in front of them examples of progress already made, progress you and your party are responsible for.\n\nSpreading the blessings of liberty to all Americans is what America is all about. Liberals have to proclaim how it was done in the past and how we\u2019re going to keep doing it in the future. Talk about how you\u2019re doing to beat everybody who wants to go backward. Offer a stirring vision. Forget about prescription drug prices and quit treating voters like despairing stiffs in dire need of a government break.\n\nDo that \u2014 or get the hell out of the way and make room for leaders who will.",

Grant in 1880, Millard Fillmore in 1856 and Martin Van Buren in 1844 and 1848.\n\nWe've got the news you need to know to start your day. Sign up for the First & 4Most morning newsletter \u2014 delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.\n\nIn all of American history, only one president \u2014 Stephen Grover Cleveland \u2014 has succeeded in winning nonconsecutive terms. Trump is now set to become the second president to leave the White House and return four years later after his projected defeat over Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nWho was former President Grover Cleveland?\n\nGetty Images Grover Cleveland. (Courtesy of Getty Images)\n\nGrover Cleveland ended the Republican Party's nearly three-decade-long hold on the presidency when he won the 1884 election, becoming the first Democrat to hold office since the Civil War ended.\n\nThe former Buffalo mayor and New York governor had garnered the support of the Democrats and \"Mugwumps,\" Republican reformists who opposed Cleveland's opponent, James G. Blaine. Cleveland built a reputation of honesty in politics amid the corruption of the Gilded Age, earning him the nickname of \"Ugly Honest.\"\n\nDuring his first term, Cleveland angered railroad companies by forcing them to return 81 million acres of illegally annexed federal land in the west and signed the Interstate Commerce Act, the first federal law regulating railroads. He also signed the Dawes Act, which allowed the government to break up tribal lands to eliminate the social cohesion of Native Americans.\n\nHe barred special favors to any economic group, vetoed more than 400 bills and called for the Republican Congress to reduce tariffs. When he was told that he had given Republicans something to vote against in the next election cycle, Cleveland said, \"What is the use of being elected or reelected unless you stand for something?\"\n\nDespite winning the popular vote by more than 100,000 votes in 1888, he lost his second presidential bid in the Electoral College to Benjamin Harrison, 233 to 157.\n\nLike Trump's 2020 run, the election had allegations of voter fraud; unlike 2020, evidence of fraud was clear in some states, according to Smithsonian Magazine. Still, Cleveland accepted defeat with grace, even holding an umbrella over Harrison's head as the nation's 23rd president gave his inauguration speech.\n\n\"This noble example which he sets will not be lost upon this country,\" The New York World wrote of Cleveland's concession, according to The Washington Post.\n\n(Trump skipped President Joe Biden's inauguration in 2021 and still maintains that the 2020 elections were \"rigged.\")\n\nCleveland and Harrison came head-to-head again in 1892. Voters had lost confidence in Harrison, whose high-tariff policy was seen as unfriendly to labor; this was punctuated by a wave of violent labor strikes at silver mines that summer. Cleveland achieved a decisive victory, making him both the 22nd and 24th president of the United States.\n\nCleveland's second term was defined by the Panic of 1893, one of the most severe financial crises America has faced. He repealed the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which had placed silver as the backing of the U.S. dollar, and maintained the Treasury's gold reserve through what critics saw as \"collusion\" with Wall Street.\n\nDuring the Pullman Strike of 1894, Cleveland responded with an iron first, dispatching troops against railroad strikers in Chicago. It resulted in the deaths of more than a dozen workers and earned Cleveland a reputation as a union buster.\n\nCleveland signed a bill declaring Labor Day a national holiday amid the crisis.\n\nHis handling of the economic depression was wildly unpopular, leading to the \"greatest realignment of voters since the Civil War,\" according to the Smithsonian. Democrats lost support everywhere but in the Deep South. Cleveland did not run for a third term. He retired in Princeton, New Jersey, and died on June 24, 1908.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump will head back to the White House for a second term.\n\nWho succeeded President Grover Cleveland after his second term?\n\nRepublican President William McKinley became the 25th president in U.S. history when he bested William Jennings Bryan, who had claimed the Democratic ticket after Cleveland did not seek reelection during the 1896 race.\n\nThe election largely came down to monetary policy and addressing the aftermath of the depression. Urban voters feared that the free coinage of silver \u2014 which Bryan championed \u2014 would be the ruin of the country, helping to tip the scales in McKinley's favor.\n\nWhat is significant about Grover Cleveland's reelection as president?\n\nCleveland's presidencies came more than a century before Trump's third bid at the White House but have hovered over the 2024 election for some obvious historical reasons.\n\nTrump is set to join Cleveland as the second president to win nonconsecutive terms.\n\nHere is the latest voting demographic breakdown from exit polls conducted by NBC News, in conjunction with other news organizations across the country.",

And to keep constantly in our minds the fact that even if someone disagrees with me, he or she is still created in the image and likeness of God...\"\n\nIn an interview with Vatican News - Vatican Radio, Archbishop Timothy Broglio, the President of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) and the Archbishop of the US Military Services, made this point as he reflected on the assassination attempt of former US President Donald Trump at an election rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on Saturday, calling \"horrific\" the event that occured \"in what is supposed to be a democratic society.\"\n\nThe presumed attacker was immediately shot and killed by secret service agents. One spectator was killed in the attack, and two others were wounded. Trump was rushed to a local hospital with a bullet wound to his right ear and was later flown to New Jersey.\n\n\n\nIn the interview, Archbishop Broglio reflects on the episode, and offers words of faith and consolation, especially while looking ahead to the imminent Eucharistic Congress in the US as an opportunity to promote peace and reconciliation.\n\nRead also 18/05/2024 Pope appoints Cardinal Tagle as his Special Envoy to US Eucharistic Congress Pope Francis appoints Cardinal Tagle as his Special Envoy to the National Eucharistic Congress in Indianapolis, United States.\n\nThe attempted assassination was met with the condemnation of US President Joe Biden, Trump\u2019s opponent in the upcoming election, and of leaders around the world. Since the attack, former President Trump seems to be ok after the bullet had grazed his ear, and since, has officially, named his vice-presidential running mate, J.D. Vance, as the Republic National Convention is underway this week in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nIn a statement issued late Sunday morning, the Holy See expressed its \"concern about last night's episode of violence, which wounds people and democracy, causing suffering and death.\" It reassured the Holy See is \"united in the prayer of never prevail the US bishops for America, for the victims, and for peace in the country, that the motives of the violent may never prevail...\n\nFirst of all, what is your reaction to this tragedy that has afflicted the United States at the rally in Pennsylvania?\n\nWell, certainly, my initial reaction is one of horror that violence would take place in what is supposed to be a democratic society, that we're not able to talk to one another. And obviously someone who was not well, but still, someone was able to make an attempt on President Trump's life. That's certainly very, very tragic.\n\nAnd that reaction of horror and the fact that this could happen, what can be done to in some way prevent or work against this sort of situation? No one would have ever thought that it could have happened even from a security standpoint, and then this is where we're at.\n\n\n\nWell, I think obviously, a technician would have to analyze what could be done from a security standpoint. But I think one thing that all of us can do is to remember and to promote the dignity of the human person. And to keep constantly in our minds the fact that even if someone disagrees with me, he or she is still created in the image and likeness of God. And therefore, as a dignity that I have to recognize and that I have to respect. I think if our society, and I'll just limit myself to the society in the United States, (that) if we were more aware of that, then we might be able to discuss as rational human beings, the problems and the disagreements that we have, and perhaps come to some solutions. But it's tragic that political discourse in this country has reached a point where people just shout at each other, and there's no space to listen to the other. And I think that's something that that Pope Francis has urged us constantly to recognize, this basic human dignity and to respect it in every way that we can.\n\nAnd in your capacity as President of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, what can Bishops do to cultivate this sort of peaceful dialogue or even coexistence among Americans?\n\nWell, I think all of us in our diocese can certainly promote the importance of dialogue, the importance of respect for the other. Even our commitment to human life is based on this notion that the human person is worthy of our respect from the moment of conception until the moment of death. I think we have to be constant in that. One of the things that we're about to begin on Wednesday is the Eucharistic Congress. And I think that will be a great opportunity for us to promote dialogue and reconciliation. And also to remember that in Jesus Christ, we find our salvation, and we also find a way forward. Obviously in the person of Christ, we find a code of conduct and I think the more we do to promote that, the better off our society will be. We can't do it all by ourselves, but we can certainly lay a foundation and urge those that we're responsible for to promote this dignity and this dialogue.\n\nAnd in the wake of this attack aimed at former President Trump and that killed an innocent bystander, what prayer or what words of comfort do you have to offer Archbishop?\n\nCertainly, to the family of the gentleman who was killed, certainly, my sympathy and my condolences and my promise of a prayer for the repose of his soul. And also to those who were wounded, including former President Trump, a message of consolation and the assurance of my prayers, and assure the prayers of all of the faithful of the United States.\n\nIs there anything else you would like to add?\n\nThis tragic event is really a call to action to all of us to measure our discourse and to move forward in pathways of peace and reconciliation and an honest assessment of whatever political differences there are and however we can work together to find solutions.\n\nListen to the full interview with Archbishop Timothy Broglio, President of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops:\n\nFile photo of President of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, Archbishop Timothy Broglio, with Pope Francis",

        "text": "US election: Elon Musk and other US tech giants are supporting Trump-Vance\nCryptobros the Winklevoss twins to Elon Musk are throwing their support behind Donald Trump's presidential bid.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMajor tech titans and investors in the United States, including Palantir\u2019s co-founder, the Winklevoss twins, and reportedly Elon Musk, are backing Donald Trump\u2019s presidential bid by donating to a political committee supporting the former US president.\n\nMusk, who has endorsed Trump on Saturday, said he is planning to pledge $45 million (\u20ac41 million) a month to the committee called America PAC, according to the Wall Street Journal on Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nAs of the end of June, the SpaceX and X boss has not yet given any money to America PAC, according to a quarterly financial filing submitted to the Federal Election Commission on Monday.\n\nIt is unclear if he donated to the committee in July.\n\nThe PAC did show that it received financial contributions from Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale, who donated $1 million (\u20ac917,000) through Lonsdale Enterprises, an entity linked to him.\n\nThe filings also showed the cryptocurrency investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss each donated $250,000 (\u20ac230,000).\n\nMeanwhile, Joe Craft, the chief executive of coal producer Alliance Resource Partners and the flounder on the Jimmy John\u2019s sandwich chain, also made $1 million in donations each.\n\nCourting crypto and tech\n\nThe Silicon Valley tech industry in California, a Democratic stronghold, has notably been a liberal region. But President Joe Biden\u2019s taxes and regulations on companies have pulled companies more to the right.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, Trump has promised donors at fundraisers to enact policies that work in their favour such as cutting corporate taxes, approving oil permits, and throwing pro-Palestinian demonstrators out of the US.\n\nHe has also done a U-turn on cryptocurrency. During his time in office, Trump deemed crypto a \u201cscam\u201d and a \u201cdisaster waiting to happen\u201d. But since running for office, the Republican Party has adopted a platform that supports crypto innovation.\n\n\"Republicans will end Democrats\u2019 unlawful and un-American crypto crackdown and oppose the creation of a Central Bank Digital Currency,\" according to the document.\n\n\"We will defend the right to mine Bitcoin, and ensure every American has the right to self-custody of their digital assets, and transact free from government surveillance and control\".\n\n\u2018Tech VC in the White House\u2019\n\nTrump\u2019s pick for his vice-president, Senator JD Vance, a former venture capitalist with investments in tech and crypto companies, could also further sway Silicon Valley.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s JD Vance. We have a former tech VC in the White House. Greatest country on earth baby,\u201d posted Delian Asparouhov, partner at a VC firm The Founders Fund, which is backed by Peter Thiel.\n\nTrump-Vance \u201cresounds with victory,\u201d echoed Musk on his platform X.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nVance invested in firms such as Christian prayer app Hollow, and Anduril Industries, a Thiel-backed artificial intelligence (AI) defence company, and said in 2022 he had between $100,000 (\u20ac91,000) and $250,000 (\u20ac230,000) tied up in Bitcoin.",

        "text": "Meet Usha Chilukuri, the Indian-origin wife of Republican JD Vance who could be US Vice President\nIf current polls hold, Ohio Senator JD Vance will be the next Vice President of the United States. Which would mean the US would have a Vice President with a close India connection for two terms in a row.\n\nVance is married to Usha Chilukuri, a San Francisco corporate litigator whose parents are Indian. At their wedding in Kentucky in 2014, \u201cthe pair were\u2026blessed by a Hindu pundit in a separate ceremony\u201d, according to The New York Times.\n\nThe current Vice President of the US is, of course Kamala Harris, the daughter of cancer researcher Shyamala Gopalan who was originally from Chennai, and Stanford economist Donald Harris, who was originally from Jamaica.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut first, who is JD Vance, who was chosen by Donald J Trump as running mate at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee late on Monday (July 15) night (India time)?\n\nYale graduate, venture capitalist: Who is JD Vance?\n\nVance grew up in humble surroundings in Middletown, Ohio. After completing high school, he enlisted with the US marines where he served in the Iraq War as a combat journalist and a public relations officer.\n\nFollowing military service, he earned an undergraduate degree in political science and philosophy from Ohio State University. He then went on to study law at the prestigious Yale Law School, where he was an editor of the Yale Law Journal.\n\nAfter graduating from Yale in 2013, he practiced law for a brief while before moving to San Francisco to work in the tech industry as a venture capitalist. Notably, he worked at PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel\u2019s Mithril Capital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA best-selling author, he was earlier a vociferous Trump critic\n\nVance rose to fame on the back of his best-selling book Hillbilly Elegy, which was published in 2016. In the year Trump romped to power for the first time, many saw Vance\u2019s autobiographical Hillbilly Elegy as a window into rural, oft-forgotten America that fuelled his rise.\n\nA review in The New York Times called Vance\u2019s book \u201ca compassionate, discerning sociological analysis of the white underclass that has helped drive the politics of rebellion, particularly the ascent of Donald J Trump\u201d. A feature-length film based on the book was released in 2020.\n\nAt the time, Vance was staunchly anti-Trump. \u201cI\u2019m a Never Trump guy,\u201d he told talk show host Charlie Rose in October 2016. In an op-ed for The Atlantic in July 2016, Vance wrote: \u201cTrump is cultural heroin\u2026 Trump\u2019s promises are the needle in America\u2019s collective vein\u2026 He makes some feel better for a bit. But he cannot fix what ails them, and one day they\u2019ll realise it\u201d.\n\nIn a private Facebook message to a friend in 2016, Vance wrote: \u201cI go back and forth between thinking Trump is a cynical asshole like [Richard] Nixon who wouldn\u2019t be that bad (and might even prove useful) or that he\u2019s America\u2019s Hitler\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom \u2018Never Trump\u2019 to die-hard loyalist\n\nVance\u2019s opinions on Trump, however, are very different at present. He reportedly voted for Trump in 2020, and in 2022, won his maiden senatorial race with the help of Trump\u2019s backing.\n\nVance has \u201cexplained his ideological shifts as a result of a twofold intellectual awakening: It turned out that Donald Trump wasn\u2019t as bad as Vance had thought, and that American liberals were much worse,\u201d The NYT wrote, post Vance\u2019s selection as Trump\u2019s running mate.\n\nIn an interview with The NYT in June, Vance had said: \u201cI allowed myself to focus so much on the stylistic element of Trump that I completely ignored the way in which he substantively was offering something very different on foreign policy, on trade, on immigration\u201d.\n\nVance today is one of the most dogged Trump defenders, many of whose opinions reflect those of the former president. He has also emerged as \u201cthe standard-bearer of the \u2018New Right\u2019 a loose movement of young conservatives trying to push the Republican Party in a more populist, nationalist and culturally conservative direction\u201d, according to Politico.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarried to Usha Chilukuri, a lawyer he met at Yale\n\nVance met Usha Chilukuri Vance during his time in Yale. The couple have three children together. Vance is Catholic, while Usha is Hindu. The family lives in Cincinnati, Ohio.\n\nUsha Chilukuri grew up in a suburb of San Diego, with a reputation of being both a \u201cleader\u201d and a \u201cbookworm\u201d among her friends from childhood and adolescence. The NYT described her in an article as \u201cbrainy, ambitious and pragmatic\u201d. After four years at Yale, she moved to Cambridge on a Gates Fellowship where, according to The NYT, she moved in \u201cmostly liberal and left-wing circles\u201d.\n\nAccording to American media reports, Usha was a registered Democrat as of 2014, but has not been vocal about her political views in recent years. From 2015 onward, Usha worked at Munger, Tolles, and Olson, a law firm that describes its corporate culture as \u201cradically progressive\u201d, and whose hiring practices have been categorised as \u201ccool\u201d and \u201cwoke\u201d. SFGate, a Bay Area publication, reported that Usha had resigned from her job \u201cjust minutes\u201d after Trump chose her husband as his running mate for the November election.\n\nAlso Read | Coconuts for Kamala Harris: Why the Internet is memeing the US VP amid speculations of her candidacy\n\nSFGate quoted from Usha\u2019s bio to say that her practice at the law firm mainly dealt with \u201ccomplex litigation and appeals in a wide variety of sectors, including higher education, local government, entertainment, and technology, including semiconductors\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe also clerked for US Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, and Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, when he was a judge at the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. She also clerked for Amul Thapar, now a judge for the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, when he served in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky, SFGate said, quoting from Usha\u2019s bio.\n\nAt Yale, she was an editor for Yale Law Journal and the Yale Journal of Law & Technology.\n\nImport of Vance\u2019s selection by Trump\n\nIn a post on his social media platform Truth Social, announcing the appointment, Trump said that Vance \u201cwill be strongly focused on the people he fought so brilliantly for, the American Workers and Farmers in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Minnesota, and far beyond.\u201d Several of these Midwestern states are likely to play a critical role in November\u2019s election.\n\nAccording to experts, picking Vance is likely to energise Trump\u2019s loyal base, with the Senator one of the most popular fixtures in conservative media. It is also likely to play out well in the Silicon Valley, where Trump is looking for financial backing for the campaign. Peter Thiel, the billionaire former CEO of PayPal, is one of Vance\u2019s biggest donors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, the pick also means that two white men will now lead the Republican ticket, as Trump seeks to make inroads into other demographics. \u201cA staunch conservative from a Republican state, Vance is unlikely to bring many new voters into Trump\u2019s corner, and may even alienate some moderates,\u201d Reuters reported.\n\nSome Trump backers wanted him to select a woman of colour to expand his coalition\u2019s reach. It will be interesting to see if this factor comes into play if by some chance President Joe Biden, who is under tremendous pressure from large Democratic donors and many Democratic politicians to step aside, does make way for Harris.",

        "text": "Conservative groups want to clean voter rolls, raising concerns about election integrity\nThe voter roll tactics include mass door-knocking campaigns, using special software designed to identify voters whose eligibility could be challenged and a crush of lawsuits. Some of those have been brought by the Republican National Committee, which hosts the GOP\u2019s national convention this coming week.\n\nThe strategy is part of a wider effort raising questions about the integrity of this year\u2019s election a s former President Donald Trump repeatedly claims without evidence that his opponents are trying to cheat.\n\nConservative groups are systematically attempting to challenge the legitimacy of large numbers of voter registrations across the country before the presidential election.\n\nSeveral Republican secretaries of state are combing through voter lists on their own, including in Ohio and Tennessee, or to comply with aggressive new state voting laws.\n\nThose behind the reviews cast them as good government endeavors intended to help local election offices clean up the rolls. Voting rights groups and Democrats believe the effort aims to shake faith in the results of the 2024 election and lay the legal groundwork to challenge the results.\n\nHere is a look at what\u2019s happening around voter roll challenges:\n\nStates already must maintain their rolls\n\n\u201cSoles to the Rolls\u201d in Michigan, whose name echoes the \u201cSouls to the Polls\u201d get-out-the-vote efforts of Black churches, and Nevada\u2019s Pigpen Project are among state-level initiatives in which volunteers are trying to find flaws in state voter rolls.\n\nTheir findings can sound ominous: dead people or non-U.S. citizens registered, or people listed at addresses where they no longer live, suggesting the potential for double-voting. Conservative activists identify the suspect records, then deliver them to local or state election offices for possible removal.\n\nMichigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, earlier this year told a suburban Detroit clerk to reinstate the registrations of about 1,000 people who had been removed through such an effort, after the purge was reported by The New York Times.\n\nAmy Cohen, executive director of the National Association of State Election Directors, said information from member states suggests the efforts are happening nationwide. She said many of the challenges ignore or misunderstand the complexity and legal requirements around maintaining voter rolls.\n\nThe National Voter Registration Act already requires states to take steps to maintain accurate and current voter registration lists. Just because someone finds an outdated registration doesn\u2019t mean election officials are unaware of it, Cohen said.\n\n\u201cVoter registration lists are living, breathing databases,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the challenge, because people move and die and change their names and just exist every single day, and when you get a list, you\u2019re purchasing a moment in time. Registration activities and voter registration list maintenance activities are happening on an ongoing basis.\u201d\n\nThe fight for voter data\n\nConservative groups behind the voter roll reviews have filed hundreds of public records requests across the country to gain access to voter files. In almost a quarter of states, the disputes have landed in the courts. One of their goals is to create public databases for anyone to search and question whether certain voters should be allowed on a state\u2019s rolls.\n\nThe Public Interest Legal Foundation, led by conservative attorney Cleta Mitchell, is behind challenges in Colorado, Hawaii, Michigan, Minnesota, South Carolina and Wisconsin. Mitchell is perhaps best known for participating in Trump\u2019s call asking Georgia\u2019s secretary of state to \u201cfind\u201d the votes he needed to win the state in 2020. Arizona, California, Maryland and Pennsylvania face lawsuits by other groups.\n\nIn Georgia, an Associated Press survey of the state\u2019s 40 largest counties found that more than 18,000 voters had been challenged over the past two years, even though local election offices had rejected most of them.\n\nMany of the volunteer groups have received encouragement to mine the voter lists at workshops led by MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, a Trump ally and leading voice promoting election conspiracy theories. They also sometimes employ tools such as EagleAI Network, a data-matching software program developed for Mitchell\u2019s Election Integrity Network that creates voter lists from change-of-address forms, criminal justice records and property tax data.\n\nThe Public Interest Legal Foundation also sued the Electronic Registration Information Center, a voluntary system in which states share data to maintain accurate voter lists. Its lawsuit sought access to information the member states had agreed to keep private when they joined.\n\nThe foundation\u2019s president and general counsel, J. Christian Adams, who previously worked in the Justice Department\u2019s Voting Section, said not a single eligible voter has been removed from the rolls as a result of his group\u2019s efforts. He called the movement\u2019s critics paranoid.\n\n\u201cFraud, I don\u2019t care about,\u201d he said. \u201cAccuracy is what I care about.\u201d He said correct voter lists are especially important in states that mail ballots to every registration on their lists.\n\nAt least nine Republican-led states have abandoned the voluntary network, known as ERIC, after it became embroiled in election conspiracy theories, weakening its ability to cross-check voter records across state lines. Supporters of the system noted the paradox of the Republican states leaving because it\u2019s the only national system that helps states identify voters who are not eligible to cast a ballot.\n\nCleaning the rolls or sowing distrust?\n\nThe Republican National Committee, newly reconstituted under Trump, also is involved in efforts to challenge voter rolls before the November election.\n\nMichigan\u2019s voter rolls have been targeted in numerous lawsuits over the past four years by the RNC and others. A Nevada lawsuit filed by the RNC in March alleges the state is violating the National Voter Registration Act by failing to keep voter registration records accurate and updated. RNC Chair Michael Whatley at the time cited the need for \u201cclean voter rolls.\u201d\n\nExperts say the federal law actually errs on the side of enfranchising voters. To prevent eligible voters from being disenrolled, it requires outdated records to remain in the system for some years after they\u2019re flagged as a potential concern. It\u2019s a technicality that can explain questions often raised by conservative groups, such as the number of voter registrations exceeding a jurisdiction\u2019s population.\n\nIt\u2019s like \u201ccomparing apples to orangutans,\u201d Nevada\u2019s Democratic attorney general said in faulting the data RNC cited in its analysis. In its brief, the Democratic National Committee cast the RNC lawsuits as building ammunition for a 2024 election challenge.\n\n\u201cThis lawsuit is little more than political theater, designed less to address any real (much less substantial) issue with Nevada\u2019s voter registration lists, than to sow public distrust in the security and integrity of our electoral systems,\u201d the filing said. \u201cIt is no more than a continuation of Republicans\u2019 2020 efforts to undermine public confidence in our elections.\u201d\n\nCasting suspicions on voting\n\nTrump ally Ken Blackwell, who leads election efforts at the America First Policy Institute, has said legitimate voters \u201crun the risk of having their hard-won right to vote diluted by unlawfully cast ballots\u201d if voter roll glitches aren\u2019t addressed.\n\nHowever, election law experts say the problem that such efforts aim to fix \u2014 ineligible voters casting ballots \u2014 remains exceptionally rare.\n\n\u201cWhy? Because it\u2019s common sense that one person voting when they\u2019re not eligible is not going to swing an election, and is going to expose himself to criminal penalties,\u201d said Alice Clapman, senior counsel with the Brennan Center for Justice\u2019s democracy program. \u201cSo, even if someone were inclined to do this, it\u2019s very high risk and very low reward.\u201d\n\nClapman said the disinformation around voter rolls is eroding trust in election officials, who already face pressure and threats, and is undermining faith in the \u201cproud civic activity\u201d of voting.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so insidious about it is voting used to be a unifying national activity,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s now become this object of suspicion, and that\u2019s really corrosive of our democracy.\u201d",

        "text": "Where J.D. Vance stands on key issues\nWhere J.D. Vance stands on key issues\n\ntoggle caption Jeff Swensen/Getty Images\n\nFor more updates from the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, head to the NPR Network's live updates page.\n\nIn his first two years in the Senate, J.D. Vance, former President Donald Trump\u2019s vice presidential pick, has established himself as a populist voice, at times clashing with Republican leadership.\n\nBut on issues like abortion, immigration and election integrity, he's closely aligned with Trump.\n\nHere's a look at where Vance stands on key issues:\n\n\n\nVance on abortion\n\nVance describes himself as \u201cpro-life,\u201d but during his 2022 Senate campaign said he would like the issue to be left to the states.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cI'd like it to be primarily a state issue,\u201d Vance said in an interview with the Cincinnati Enquirer. \u201cOhio is going to want to have a different abortion policy from California, from New York, and I think that's reasonable.\u201d\n\nBut in the same interview, Vance signaled openness to \u201c some minimum national standard.\u201d\n\nIn a 2022 debate with Democratic Senate candidate Tim Ryan, Vance said he would support \u201ca number of different exceptions\u201d but did not specify what exactly those exceptions would be.\n\nNPR has reached out to Vance\u2019s staff for clarification on the federal role in abortion policy and what exceptions he supports.\n\nEarlier this month, Vance said on NBC's Meet the Press that he supports the availability of the abortion pill mifepristone.\n\nThe anti-abortion group Students for Life Action gave Vance an A- on their \u201cPro-Life Generation Report Card.\u201d\n\nVance on aid to Ukraine\n\nVance is one of the leading congressional Republican voices against U.S. aid to Ukraine. In an April op-ed, Vance wrote that he \u201cremains opposed to virtually any proposal for the United States to continue funding this war.\u201d\n\nIn the same op-ed, he encouraged Biden to pursue a negotiated peace with Putin.\n\nIn September 2023, Vance was among a group of Republican senators who opposed President Biden\u2019s request for additional Ukraine aid.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cThe American people deserve to know what their money has gone to,\u201d the senators wrote. \u201cHow is the counteroffensive going? Are the Ukrainians any closer to victory than they were 6 months ago? What is our strategy, and what is the president\u2019s exit plan? What does the administration define as victory in Ukraine?\u201d\n\nJohn Conway, a leader of the group Republicans for Ukraine, called Vance\u2019s selection as Trump\u2019s running mate \u201ca huge disappointment to all Republicans who want to see Ukraine win, Russia lose, and Putin defeated.\u201d\n\n\u201cSen. Vance has a long history of confusing free, America-loving countries like Ukraine with tyrannical, corrupt, anti-American dictatorships like Russia,\u201d Conway said in a statement to NPR. \u201cThe establishment of the Republican Party cannot continue to ignore the millions of Republicans who value American national security and understand that Ukraine is America\u2019s friend and Putin is America\u2019s enemy.\u201d\n\nVance on election integrity\n\nIn Sen. J.D. Vance, former President Donald Trump has found a fellow election denier as his running mate \u2014 one who's already sown seeds of doubt about the upcoming presidential election.\n\nWhile running for the Senate in 2022, Vance said on the campaign trail that he thought the 2020 election was \u201cstolen from Trump.\u201d And earlier this year, Vance told ABC News he still questions the results of the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cDo I think there were problems in 2020? Yes, I do,\u201d he told George Stephanopoulos in February.\n\nSpeaking on CNN in May, Vance downplayed the severity of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, saying he was \"truly skeptical\" that former Vice President Mike Pence's life \"was ever in danger,\" despite chants from the crowd that Pence should be hanged.\n\n\u201cI think politics and politics people like to really exaggerate things from time to time,\" Vance said.\n\nVance on immigration\n\nVance has taken a hard line on immigration; he has often decried a \"crisis\" at the southern border and called for funding and constructing a border wall.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSpeaking on Fox News in June, Vance said he believes the U.S. should conduct \"large-scale deportations.\"\n\nLike Trump, Vance wants to \"drain the swamp\"\n\nIn a 2021 podcast, Vance advised Trump to, \u201cfire every single mid-level bureaucrat, every civil servant in the administrative state, replace them with our people,\u201d and then potentially defy the Supreme Court if the president was sued.\n\nVance's words sound like a \"winning message,\" Caroline Sunshine, deputy communications director for the Trump campaign, told NPR's Morning Edition.",

Fight! Fight!\u201d the former president said, as some of the supporters, who moments before had feared for their lives, began cheering.\n\nThe bloodshed in Pennsylvania will leave a lasting mark on the American psyche, puncturing the veneer of security around the highest levels of presidential politics \u2013 of magnetic screening, bulletproof limousines and heavily armed Secret Service agents. Even former presidents are not insulated from the violence that can erupt in everyday American life.\n\nIt was also a dramatic moment in American political history; one that is sure to be replayed in video clips, still photographs and testimonial accounts throughout the course of this presidential campaign and in campaigns to come.\n\nIn a rare address from the Oval Office Sunday evening, President Joe Biden called on Americans to cool the temperature around political debate.\n\n\"[It] must never be a battlefield and, God forbid, a killing field,\" he warned. \"No matter how strong our convictions, we must never descend into violence.\"",

        "text": "Trump-Biden 2024 Polls: Here\u2019s Who\u2019s Winning In The 6 States That Will Decide The Election\nTopline\n\nThe outcome of the presidential election likely hinges on six purple states President Joe Biden won in 2020\u2014but he trails former President Donald Trump in all of them, according to RealClearPolitics\u2019 polling averages, with less than six months before the November general election.\n\nPresident Joe Biden speaks about his Investing in America agenda, at Gateway Technical College in ... [+] Sturtevant, Wisconsin, on May 8, 2024. (Photo by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images\n\nKey Facts\n\nArizona: Trump leads by 5.7 points, a 1.7-point increase since early June, according to Real Clear Politics\u2019 polling average that shows him beating Biden (who won the state by fewer than 11,000 votes in 2020) in all six polls included in the tracker since June 11. Georgia: Trump is up 3.9 points in the state, nearly a one-point decline for the former president over the past six weeks, though all five polls included in Real Clear Politics\u2019 polling average (dating back to May 30) show Trump winning by at least three points. Michigan: Trump holds his narrowest lead, 1.3 points, of any swing state here, according to the average of six polls dating back to June 21, with just one showing Biden winning (Biden flipped Michigan in 2020). Nevada: Biden also won this state by three points in 2020, but polls this year show Trump would beat him by five points, according to the average of six polls dating back to June 1, all showing Trump winning. Pennsylvania: Trump holds a 4.5-point average lead and is ahead in all six polls dating back to June 27 included in the Real Clear Politics\u2019 polling average, after Biden won the state by one point in 2020, flipping Trump\u2019s 2016 win. Wisconsin: Trump is winning here by three points, according to Real Clear Politics\u2019 average of six polls dating back to June 28, with five showing Trump winning (Biden beat Trump by less than one point in Wisconsin in 2020 after Trump won the state in 2016).\n\nBig Number\n\n77. That\u2019s the total number of Electoral College votes the six swing states carry, of 270 needed to win the presidential election.\n\nSurprising Fact\n\nVirginia has become an unlikely battleground state in this year\u2019s election, with a July 9-12 New York Times/Siena poll showing Biden winning by just three points in the state, after beating Trump there by 10 points in 2020.\n\nKey Background\n\nTrump has widened his narrow lead over Biden in the wake of their June 27 debate, with most surveys taken since showing Trump winning and more voters saying Biden is too old to serve another term. Trump now leads Biden by 2.7 points nationally in a head-to-head contest, according to the Real Clear Politics\u2019 average, a two-point increase since early June.\n\nWhat We Don\u2019t Know\n\nHow the assassination attempt against Trump on Saturday at his rally in Pennsylvania will affect his polling lead. A national Morning Consult poll of 2,045 registered voters conducted Monday found Trump up by one point, a slight decline since the firm\u2019s poll taken July 12-14, when Trump was up by two points. Thirty-eight percent of voters said they blame Trump for the shooting, in which the former president was grazed with a bullet, one audience member was killed and two others were seriously injured.\n\nWhat To Watch For\n\nAssuming Trump\u2019s polling leads in Arizona, Georgia and Nevada sustain through November, Biden would have to win all three Rust Belt swing states, plus a portion of electoral votes in Maine and Nebraska, which award some of their electoral votes proportionally, in order to win the presidency. Biden\u2019s lagging poll numbers in Arizona, Georgia and Nevada are widely viewed as a symptom of his loss of support among younger, Hispanic and Black voters.\n\nTangent\n\nTrump and his allies unsuccessfully sought to challenge the 2020 results in the six swing states, claiming election fraud, via court action and various schemes to overturn the results, leading to a string of indictments. Fulton County, Georgia prosecutors charged Trump and 18 others in August last year with a sprawling racketeering scheme to overturn the election results in the state. The Wisconsin attorney general on Tuesday also charged two attorneys and an aide who attempted to submit fake paperwork to Congress to certify the state\u2019s results in Trump\u2019s favor with felony forgery. In Arizona, a grand jury charged 18 people, including ex-Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, with a similar plot as the one allegedly attempted in Wisconsin.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nPost-Trump Conviction Polls Show Warning Signs\u2014Most Independents Think Trump Should Drop Out (Forbes)\n\nBiden Vs.

        "text": "Celebrate Democracy by ensuring you are prepared to vote in the 2024 U.S. Election\nTo vote in the November 2024 election, U.S. citizens overseas need to have completed a Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) in 2024. Whether you are a first-time voter or have already received ballots and voted absentee in past elections, you must complete an FPCA each calendar year to ensure you can participate in elections as an overseas absentee voter.\n\nYou can get voting assistance from the embassy/consulate or drop off your completed voting forms and ballots, addressed to your local election officials, for delivery to the United States via diplomatic pouch.\n\nBallots can be dropped off at the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate, from 9:00 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. Monday through Friday (excluding these holidays). Be prepared to present your U.S. passport during your visit and remember to seal your ballot. You can also return your FPCA or ballot to your local election officials via international mail or professional courier service at your own expense. Normal transit time from Rome to the United States is ten (10) days. Please add two days for any ballots shipped from other consulates in Italy.\n\nEven if you have never voted while overseas before, the process is easy.\n\n1. Request your ballot. Complete a new Federal Post Card Application (FPCA). You must complete a new FPCA after January 1, 2024, to ensure you receive your ballot for the 2024 elections. Submitting the FPCA allows you to request absentee ballots for all elections for federal offices (President, U.S. Senate, and U.S. House of Representatives) including primaries and special elections during the calendar year in which it is submitted. All local election officials in all U.S. states and territories accept the FPCA.\n\nYou can complete the FPCA online at FVAP.gov. The online voting assistant will ask you questions specific to your state. We encourage you to request your blank ballots be delivered electronically (by email, internet download, or fax, depending on your state). Include your email address on your FPCA to take advantage of the electronic ballot delivery option. Return the FPCA per the instructions on the website. The online voting assistant will tell you if your state allows the FPCA to be returned electronically or if you must submit a paper copy with original ink signature. If you must return a paper version, please follow the same instructions below for returning your ballot.\n\n2. Receive and complete your ballot. States are required to send out ballots 45 days before a regular election for federal office and generally send ballots at least 30 days before primary elections. For most states, you can confirm your registration and ballot delivery online.\n\n3. Return your completed ballot. While some states allow you to return your completed ballot electronically, others do not. If your state requires you to return paper voting forms or ballots to local election officials, you can do so free of charge at the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate. Place your ballot in a postage-paid return envelope, or in an envelope bearing sufficient domestic U.S. postage, and address it to the relevant local election officials.\n\nResearch candidates and issues. Please see the FVAP links page for resources you can use to research candidates and issues. FVAP regularly sends information about election dates and deadlines through their Voting Alerts. Email vote@fvap.gov to subscribe or follow FVAP on Facebook or Twitter.\n\n\n\nLearn more at the Federal Voting Assistance Program\u2019s (FVAP) website, FVAP.gov. If you have any questions about registering to vote overseas, please contact your nearest embassy or consulate:\n\nU.S. Embassy Rome, Italy\n\nVia Vittorio Veneto, 121\n\n+39 06 46741\n\nVoteRome@state.gov\n\nhttps://it.usembassy.gov/\n\nRemember, your vote counts!",

        "text": "US Presidential Election 2024 And Its Double India Connection\nIt's been an eventful month in US politics ahead of the November 5 presidential elections. First, President Joe Biden came under severe criticism for what many described as an abysmal performance in the first presidential debate. And then, last Saturday, his Republican counterpart Donald Trump was shot at during a rally in Pennsylvania. The former president survived the attack with a minor injury on his ear.\n\nAs the world prepares for what's likely to be a neck-and-neck contest between the two candidates, there's another aspect of these elections worth taking note of - its India connection.\n\nFour years ago, it was Kamala Harris, who created history when she became the US Vice President. This time, there's another individual with roots in India. It's Usha Vance, the wife of JD Vance, who is former President Donald Trump's running mate.\n\nKamala Harris traces her roots in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu where her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, was born. Ms Shyamala went to the US as a teenager to pursue a PhD at the University of California, Berkeley. There, she met Donald J. Harris, and the two got married in 1963. They had two daughters, Kamala Harris (born 1964) and Maya.\n\nMeanwhile, Usha Chilukuri Vance was born to immigrant parents from Chilakaluripeta, Andhra Pradesh. She graduated from Yale University with a degree in History, then earned her M.Phil in Early Modern History from Columbia University, and a JD in Law from Yale Law School. She has worked in prestigious law firms and at the US Supreme Court as a legal clerk.\n\nIf Biden wins, Kamala Harris will continue her role as Vice President. However, if Trump and Vance emerge victorious, Usha Vance will become the Second Lady and will live at the Naval Observatory.\n\nRecent polls show the popularity of candidates among US voters. According to YouGov, Kamala Harris is liked by 49 per cent of people, while only 28 per cent approve of JD Vance. The poll also shows that many Americans are still deciding what they think about Vance, who is still little-known in presidential politics.\n\nA year ago, in July 2023, Republican and Indian-origin Hirsh Vardhan Singh announced his bid for the US President in 2024 against Donald Trump who was facing legal challenges. He had filed his candidacy and declared himself a \"lifelong Republican\" and \"America First\" conservative. He also referred to himself as the \"only pureblood candidate\" because he \"never gave in to the COVID vaccinations.\"",

        "text": "Is RFK Jr truly independent?\nA leaked video of a call with Donald Trump has reopened a debate on where the Kennedy scion stands ahead of the November US election.\n\nRobert F Kennedy Jr, a member of America\u2019s most famous \u2013 and Democratic \u2013 political family, is running as an independent candidate in this year\u2019s presidential election. But his independence was called into question this week after the leaking of a conversation between him and Republican nominee Donald Trump.\n\nLast October, Kennedy dropped out of the Democratic primary race against incumbent President Joe Biden to launch what appeared to be a quixotic independent bid for the presidency.\n\nBoth Biden and Trump were eager to crush the freewheeler\u2019s bid, depicting him as a dangerous ally of the opposite camp, both lobbing accusations of him being an election \u201cplant\u201d or \u201cspoiler\u201d.\n\nNow, Democrats are alleging that the leaked conversation proves an alliance between RFK and Trump. So what\u2019s going on? Is RFK working with Team Trump or is he truly independent? Where does he stand on key issues \u2013 and does he align more with Republicans or with Democrats?\n\nWhat happened during the call?\n\nDuring the chat, which took place following an assassination attempt on Trump over the weekend, the Republican nominee appeared to be coaxing Kennedy to join his campaign.\n\n\u201cI would love you to do something \u2013 and I think it would be so good for you and so big for you,\u201d said Trump, audible over speakerphone. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna win.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d replied Kennedy.\n\nAside from references to bringing Kennedy onto his side \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019re way ahead of the guy,\u201d Trump said, referring to Biden \u2013 the Republican nominee also appeared to be playing to Kennedy\u2019s anti-vaxxer views.\n\n\u201cWhen you feed a baby, Bobby,\u201d Trump said, \u201ca vaccination that is like 38 different vaccines, and it looks like it\u2019s meant for a horse, not a, you know, 10-pound or 20-pound baby \u2026 and then you see the baby all of a sudden starting to change radically.\n\n\u201cAnd then you hear that it doesn\u2019t have an impact, right? But you and I talked about that a long time ago.\u201d\n\nTrump also spoke to Kennedy about Saturday\u2019s assassination attempt, saying that the bullet that hit his ear \u201cfelt like a giant \u2013 like the world\u2019s largest mosquito\u201d.\n\nBut what was the call really about?\n\nThe call was an attempt to \u201cneutralise or co-opt RFK so he doesn\u2019t syphon off potential Trump voters\u201d, Steffen Schmidt, professor emeritus in the department of political science at Iowa State University, told Al Jazeera. \u201cHe\u2019s using The Art of the Deal tactic to gain that small but important political ground.\u201d\n\nMelissa Smith, author of the 2022 book, Third Parties, Outsiders, and Renegades, agreed.\n\n\u201cThe video seemed to be more of Trump trying to sway Kennedy to endorse his campaign,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cKennedy is focusing his attention on fundraising and trying to get his name on the ballot in all 50 states, which is a very expensive task. His fundraising has been slow recently, and that makes him look more vulnerable to the other campaigns,\u201d Smith said.\n\nDid Trump and RFK Jr also meet?\n\nThey did, apparently on Monday, before the start of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, hours before the Republican nominee announced Ohio Senator JD Vance as his pick for vice president.\n\nPolitico reported the meeting that day, with claims from sources that Trump had discussed the possibility of Kennedy supporting his campaign.\n\nSeeking to dispel reports, Kennedy came clean on Monday about his \u201cmeeting this morning\u201d with Trump, underlining that they had discussed \u201cnational unity\u201d and that he hoped to also meet Democratic leaders to discuss the same topic.\n\n\u201cNo, I am not dropping out of the race,\u201d he said.\n\nWho is RFK Jr?\n\nA member of the Kennedy family, Robert Francis Kennedy Jr is a son of US Attorney General and Senator Robert F Kennedy, and a nephew of US President John F Kennedy and Senator Ted Kennedy.\n\nKennedy ditched the Democrats last year after it became clear that his long-shot primary bid was unlikely to succeed.\n\nSince then, he has campaigned as an independent, hawking a mind-bending brand of left- and right-wing politics \u2013 largely liberal on issues like abortion, while endorsing libertarian free-market solutions on the environment, and peddling conspiracy theories on vaccines.\n\nAmid a national mood of political disenchantment, the longtime environmental lawyer and anti-vaccine activist has projected himself as a political outsider, blasting \u201ccorporate kleptocracy\u201d.\n\nCould he be teaming up with Trump?\n\n\u201cHe could be or not \u2026 I don\u2019t think he has a road map,\u201d said Schmidt, speaking about Kennedy. \u201cHe\u2019s a ship in search of a port and at this point, I don\u2019t think he himself even knows where he wants to tie up and disembark.\u201d\n\nUnlike many other politicians who ultimately need to fall in line with either Democrats or Republicans, Kennedy \u201cis both dependent on his own cult following of anti-vaxxers and environmentalists and independent in that he has lots of cash and doesn\u2019t have to be accountable to anyone\u201d, Schmidt said.\n\nSmith, the author, said Kennedy would not join Trump at this point.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s somewhat predictable that Trump did all the talking, and you only see Kennedy respond in a monosyllable one time,\u201d she told Al Jazeera.\n\nWhat are Kennedy\u2019s views?\n\nThey\u2019re a mixed bag. Once named a \u201cHero of the Planet\u201d by Time magazine, he has threatened to repeal Biden\u2019s signature climate legislation, which pushes for a transition to a green economy, calling for a market-led approach \u2013 a stance closer to Trump\u2019s on the environment.\n\nOn immigration, he supports Trump\u2019s \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy that forces asylum seekers to wait south of the border for immigration hearings \u2013 a policy the Biden administration tried to end. This said, he is calling for the use of technology, such as cameras and detectors, in places where a physical wall is not necessary.\n\nHe has pitched himself as an antiwar candidate opposing aid to Ukraine and blaming the US and NATO for creating a \u201cproxy war\u201d with Russia \u2013 echoing a position taken by sections of the conservative right. Trump too has opposed aid to Ukraine.\n\nYet, RFK has staunchly defended Israel\u2019s no-limits war on Gaza, bringing him into alignment with Biden.\n\nKennedy\u2019s position on abortion has shifted during the campaign, but he is closer to Democrats on the issue. Having endorsed federal restrictions on abortion after the first trimester, he later issued a statement that abortion should be unrestricted until \u201cthe baby is viable outside the womb\u201d.\n\nHe is perhaps best known for his anti-vaxxer views, abundantly aired during the COVID-19 pandemic when he accused the US government\u2019s then-chief medical adviser, Anthony Fauci, of \u201ca historic coup d\u2019etat against Western democracy\u201d.\n\nHow was the video leaked?\n\nThe video was first posted by Kennedy\u2019s son, Robert F Kennedy III, with the message: \u201cI am a firm believer that these sorts of conversations should be had in public. Here\u2019s Trump giving his real opinion to my dad about vaccinating kids \u2013 this was the day after the assassination attempt.\u201d\n\nThe video call spread like wildfire on social media, with Kennedy apologising to Trump on Tuesday on social media platform X.\n\n\u201cWhen President Trump called me, I was taping with an in-house videographer,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI should have ordered the videographer to stop recording immediately. I am mortified that this was posted,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen President Trump called me I was taping with an in-house videographer. I should have ordered the videographer to stop recording immediately. I am mortified that this was posted. I apologize to the president. \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr (@RobertKennedyJr) July 16, 2024\n\nWhere is Kennedy in this race?\n\nNo third-party candidate has won the presidency in more than a century and a half, and the latest polls show Kennedy with about 8 percent support.\n\nHowever, Kennedy has what pundits are calling the \u201cX factor\u201d. Polls back in May showed that his use of social media and appeal among younger voters could give him unpredictable sway in key swing states like North Carolina. The state\u2019s election board voted Tuesday to certify the We The People party that supporters of Kennedy are using as a vehicle for him to run in a handful of states.\n\nNot including North Carolina, Kennedy\u2019s campaign has said he is officially on the ballot in nine states and that signatures have been submitted in 14 more.\n\nA threat to the big two?\n\nBoth the Democrats and the Republicans see Kennedy as a threat, said Smith.\n\n\u201cSo it makes sense that Trump was asking Kennedy to endorse him. Trump would like to have Kennedy\u2019s voters [many of them young] supporting him, as that is a demographic that any presidential candidate would like to win,\u201d she said.\n\nIndeed, an NBC poll in April found that Kennedy was cutting deeper into Trump\u2019s support.\n\nRepublican voters viewed him much more favourably (40 percent positive, 15 percent negative) than Democratic voters (16 percent positive, 53 percent negative).\n\nStill, Democrats are mindful of what happened in 2000, when Green Party candidate Ralph Nader was blamed for Al Gore\u2019s loss of Florida \u2013 and the presidency \u2013 to George W Bush.\n\nThe Democratic Party has been fighting hard to neutralise Kennedy, filing Federal Election Commission complaints against him and his allies to try to keep him off the ballot in several states. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) has also sponsored advertisement campaigns attacking Kennedy.\n\nDemocrats claim that Kennedy is being funded by MAGA donors, notably the reclusive Tim Mellon, who has reportedly contributed $20m to Kennedy\u2019s campaign.\n\nAs the leaked video of the conversation between Kennedy and Trump went viral, Democratic National Committee spokesperson Matt Corridoni posted on X: \u201cWhen people show you who they are, believe them\u201d.\n\nLast night: @RobertKennedyJr has dinner with Tucker Carlson at the #RNCConvention This AM: Video posts of a phone call between Trump and RFK Jr. Note how the response from RFK Jr. is \"yeah\" when Trump says \"we're gonna win.\" When people show you who they are, believe them: https://t.co/WYPUiBge4Z \u2014 Matt Corridoni (@mattcorridoni) July 16, 2024\n\nHow does Kennedy view his former party?\n\nKennedy\u2019s campaign hasn\u2019t been going well in recent days.\n\nThis month, Vanity Fair revealed the independent candidate had allegedly groped babysitter Eliza Cooney in the late 90s. While Kennedy later apologised to Cooney by text, she later told The Washington Post that she found the message from Mr Kennedy \u201cdisingenuous and arrogant\u201d.\n\nFor his part, Kennedy claims that the Democrats are out to get him, suggesting that they are in cahoots with the media.\n\n\u201cThe [Democratic National Convention] media\u2019s garbage pail journalism may distract us from President Biden\u2019s cognitive deficits but it does little to elevate the national debate or reduce the price of groceries,\u201d he said on X.",

Why that matters\nCNN \u2014\n\nShalabh \u201cShalli\u201d Kumar was filled with pride Monday night as Donald Trump made his highly anticipated announcement of who would be his running mate in the 2024 election.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t Ohio Sen. JD Vance\u2019s name alone that elicited the reaction for the founder of the Republican Hindu Coalition and the chair of the Hindu and Indian Coalition of the Republican National Committee.\n\nIt was Vance\u2019s wife, Usha, a 38-year-old Yale graduate and the daughter of Indian immigrants.\n\n\u201cHindus have come a long way,\u201d Kumar said, noting the growth of their population and political power since he moved to the United States in the late \u201860s. \u201cIt\u2019s about time,\u201d he said, adding the Vances \u201care going to represent a new generation of Americans.\u201d\n\nThe 2024 presidential campaign has seen three politicians of South Asian descent vying for the White House: Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy both competed during the Republican primaries, while Vice President Kamala Harris is running for a second term with President Joe Biden.\n\nOn the second night of the convention, both Haley and Ramaswamy unequivocally backed the Trump-Vance ticket during prime-time speeches at the Republican National Convention.\n\nAnd Wednesday night, Usha Vance will introduce her husband as Trump\u2019s running mate in a speech that marks her first official move as a member of the Trump-Vance campaign.\n\nAs Asian Americans take a more central role in the 2024 presidential campaign, political activists from both parties say they hope the increase in representation will correspond with a push to connect with a voting bloc that has long been overlooked.\n\nThe fastest-growing voting bloc\n\nThe increase in South Asian representation in politics is \u201cphenomenal,\u201d said Chintan Patel, executive director of Indian American Impact, a national organization that works to increase representation and civic engagement among Indian and South Asian communities.\n\n\u201cSince Impact was founded in 2016, representation within South Asian communities went from approximately 50 elected officials to more than 300 nationwide, including obviously the vice president of the United States Kamala Harris,\u201d Patel told CNN.\n\nThat representation, Patel added, is key because \u201cit helps reimagine what\u2019s possible for our community.\u201d\n\nTrump campaign sources tell CNN they think Usha Vance could appeal to minority voters.\n\nAsian Americans are the fastest-growing racial or ethnic group of eligible voters in the United States, according to a recent analysis by Pew Research Center.\n\nSince 2020, according to Pew, the number of eligible Asian American voters has increased by 2 million \u2013 roughly the population of Nebraska.\n\nBut despite their growing electoral power, both parties need to do more to engage with this critical voting bloc, said Christine Chen, executive director of APIAVote, a nonpartisan group dedicated to empowering Asian American and Pacific Islander voters.\n\n\u201cHeading into this cycle, we believe that the scars of 2020, in terms of what we experienced with the rise of anti-Asian hate as well as dealing with the pandemic, that everyone understands the role that elected officials play and the importance of us casting our vote,\u201d Chen said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also trying to reemphasize to the campaigns and the parties that they really need to do a better job in terms of reaching out to our growing base of (the) electorate, but also doing it early.\u201d\n\nLast week, APIAVote, in collaboration with AAPI Data, Asian Americans Advancing Justice and the AARP released the 2024 Asian American Voter Survey, a survey of the key issues driving Asian American voters this election cycle.\n\nWhile 90% of Asian American voters surveyed said they plan to vote for president, Congress and other offices this November, the survey also notes that half said they have not been contacted by the Democratic Party, and 57% said the same of Republicans.\n\n\u201cThis is disturbing because this has consistently been the case cycle and after cycle,\u201d Chen said.\n\nThat lack of outreach, she said, has the potential to swing elections in battleground states like Georgia, where APIAVote\u2019s data shows the number of eligible Asian American voters exceeds the margin of victory in 2020.\n\nThe key issues for Asian American voters\n\nBut, Patel said, like every voting bloc, the powerful symbol that representation brings also has to be married with substance and commitment to the issues that matter to Asian American voters.\n\nAccording to the Asian American voter survey, the economy, education, inflation and immigration were \u201chighly important\u201d for Asian Americans this election cycle.\n\nKumar said immigration is top of mind for many South Asian Republican voters because of the backlog facing millions of Hindu and Indian Americans who are waiting for green cards.\n\nAnd while they differ politically, Patel said his organization has heard from many progressive Indian American voters who are also concerned about immigration, particularly the plans outlined in Project 2025 \u2013 the conservative blueprint for the next Republican president \u2013 that call for mass deportations.\n\nChen said the work must continue to engage with Asian American voters \u2013 many of whom are immigrant, first-time voters \u2013 to understand the key role they could play in the upcoming election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually for us to protect a democracy,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone needs to participate. It\u2019s no longer a democracy if only a few participate in the election process.\u201d",

        "text": "Millions of Venezuelans living abroad will be unable to vote in upcoming presidential election\nLast April, Mauro Graterol arrived at the Venezuelan consulate in Lima, Per\u00fa, to register to vote. Instead, he found out he was not eligible because officials were asking for an unexpected requirement he didn\u2019t have: a permanent residence permit.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 60 years old, and I\u2019ve always participated in elections in my country, but for the first time, I won\u2019t be able to vote because the government didn\u2019t allow me,\u201d Graterol said.\n\nGraterol is not alone.\n\nThe permanent residence permit requirement, instituted in 2018, has disqualified millions of Venezuelan immigrants living across Latin America and Spain with temporary residence visas or refugee status from being able to register to vote.\n\nThe Venezuelan diaspora has grown significantly in the past decade. Close to 8 million Venezuelans have fled the country in recent years, escaping political turmoil, poverty and increased oppression. Of those, about 5 million are eligible to vote, representing a quarter of the electorate.\n\nVenezuelans gather at their consulate to ask about voting requirements and procedures for this year\u2019s Venezuelan presidential election, in Bogota, Colombia, April 11, 2024. Fernando Vergara/AP\n\nBut the government stopped registering out-of-country voters in 2018, and its registry remained closed until March of this year, when it briefly reopened for one month to allow Venezuelans abroad to sign up or update their domicile.\n\nOnly 508 people were able to make these updates this year, adding very little to the list of 69,000 voters who were already registered before 2018.\n\nIn Colombia \u2014 home to 2.8 million Venezuelans \u2014 only 25 were able to sign up for voting.\n\nNone of the roughly 800,000 Venezuelans living in the US will be able to vote because all consulates and embassies have remained closed since 2019, when the two countries broke diplomatic relations.\n\nVenezuelan immigrants interviewed in Mexico, Colombia, Per\u00fa and Spain described significant delays at consulates, unexpected requirements and imprecise information from public officials when they tried to sign up.\n\nPeople stand outside of the Venezuelan consulate in Lima, Per\u00fa. Abby Ardiles/The World\n\nSome consulates asked for an up-to-date passport to be able to vote, which can take several months to get and costs up to $300.\n\n\u201cSome of these new conditions are unconstitutional,\u201d said Edgard Sim\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez, a Venezuelan political activist in Florida. \u201cFor example, according to the law, the electoral registry should always accept new voters, but it remained closed to people abroad for six years.\u201d Also, in the past, Venezuelans only needed a national identification card (c\u00e9dula) to participate in elections, not an up-to-date passport.\n\nConsulate officials in Mexico City, Lima and Barcelona declined to make comments.\n\nIn Barcelona, as of July 17, Venezuelans had no information about where to vote. Elections are on July 28.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s authoritarian President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro is under big pressure. The country will hold elections in less than two weeks, and he\u2019s performing badly in the polls. Observers are questioning how far he might go to cling to power, and some say one strategy has been deliberately making it difficult for voters abroad to participate in elections.\n\nVenezuelan President Nicolas Maduro gestures to supporters during a campaign rally in Caracas, Venezuela, July 16, 2024. Venezuela is set to hold presidential elections on July 28. Cristian Hernandez/AP\n\n\u201cYou can assume that most of those votes would be against the government, so there is an incentive there for the government to try to disenfranchise or discourage those people from voting,\u201d said Fernanda Buril, deputy director of the Center for Applied Research and Learning at the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES).\n\nDavid Smilde, a professor of sociology at Tulane University who has researched Venezuela, said, \u201cMaduro is trying to whittle away the opposition vote and, on the other hand, maximize his chances so that he can actually pull it out or come close.\u201d\n\nLast October, Maduro promised to grant free and fair elections after a long negotiation process with the US.\n\nBut the commitment was broken after the Maduro government blocked the leading opposition candidate, Maria Corina Machado, from running.\n\nOpposition coalition presidential hopeful Maria Corina Machado gives a press conference outside her campaign headquarters in Caracas, Venezuela, Jan. 29, 2024, days after the country\u2019s highest court upheld a ban on her candidacy. Ariana Cubillos/AP\n\n\u201cIn Venezuela, the playing field for elections is tilted,\u201d Buril said. \u201cFor years, we\u2019ve seen abuse of state resources, disqualification of opposition candidates and a complete monopoly over the media.\u201d\n\nThese non-competitive conditions have left many Venezuelans abroad feeling disappointed and skeptical about electoral events.\n\n\u201cI lost interest in participating,\u201d said Jocelyn Colinas in Mexico City. \u201cI feel tired and frustrated after years trying for a change in Venezuela, so years ago, I decided to disconnect from the news to protect my mental health.\u201d\n\nBrandon Caballero, who lives in Barcelona, Spain, didn\u2019t even look into registering because his vote, he said, won\u2019t make any difference. \u201cIn Venezuela, change does not depend on voting.\u201d\n\nBut for many Venezuelans, this is the closest the opposition has been to pushing Maduro out of power.\n\nAfter Machado was banned from running, the opposition managed to unite behind one candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, who is well ahead in the polls.\n\nVenezuelan opposition presidential candidate Edmundo Gonzalez waves a flag next to opposition leader Maria Corina Machado during an opening campaign rally for the upcoming presidential election in Caracas, Venezuela, July 4, 2024. Ariana Cubillos/AP\n\nAnd many Venezuelans are hopeful.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of faith,\u201d said Nereida Rosales in Mexico City. \u201cI believe change is possible this time, and I will return as soon as it happens,\u201d she said, breaking down in tears.\n\nAt stake in this election is the future of Venezuela\u2019s democracy, as well as for the millions of Venezuelans who have left their country.\n\nAbby Ardiles contributed to this report from Lima, Per\u00fa.",

        "text": "US presidential election: Haley and DeSantis pledge allegiance to Trump at Republican convention\nNikki Haley at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on July 16, 2024. JEENAH MOON / REUTERS\n\nVoluntary memory loss is a common phenomenon in politics. It allows people to speak with authority, as if yesterday's truths had never existed. On Tuesday, July 16, each in their own way, Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley offered a striking demonstration of this at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nThe governor of Florida and the former ambassador to the UN, both of whom were defeated and badly treated by Donald Trump during the primaries, praised the Republican candidate seated in the room. DeSantis announced his support for Trump as soon as he withdrew from the race for the Republican nomination. Haley, on the other hand, delayed, hesitated and wasn't even scheduled to attend the convention. In the course of an intense evening, they pledged their allegiance to the same man whose record, personality and excesses they had criticized.\n\nDeSantis, as usual, spoke without any qualms or mention of the primaries. He trotted out his campaign staples, from \"gender ideology\" to mandatory vaccines and the migration crisis. He held up Florida as an example and took aim at incumbent President Joe Biden in harsh terms, illustrating just how short an interlude the calls for moderation after the assassination attempt on Trump was.\n\nAs for the words he used to express his support, they were emphatic. \"Donald Trump has been demonized. He's been sued. He's been prosecuted. We cannot let him down. And we cannot let America down.\"\n\nPost-Trump\n\nThe audience of delegates was ecstatic, confirming by their shouts and applause that DeSantis retains a high standing in the Make America Great Again world. At the beginning of 2023, the Florida governor represented the post-Trump alternative, ideologically consistent with the movement. He had amassed a monumental war chest of nearly $150 million (\u20ac137.5 million). A catastrophic campaign and Trump's daily onslaught were his undoing.\n\nRead more Subscribers only After shots fired at Trump, calls for unity in a fractured nation as Republican convention begins\n\nTwo days before the New Hampshire primary in January, DeSantis withdrew from the race, throwing his support behind the eventual winner. Withdrawing to Florida, the governor then mobilized the Republican donors who helped him bolster the former president's resources. Aged 45, DeSantis is already positioning himself for the post-Trump era and the inevitable dispute over his successor. The sudden arrival of the 39-year-old J. D. Vance as Trump's running mate, even though Vance has only recently become a senator, hinders his progress.\n\nYou have 65.73% of this article left to read. The rest is for subscribers only.",

And Wednesday, during an interview with ABC13 he announced his vice presidential running mate.\n\nMr. Else is a 35-year-old from north Texas who teaches middle school math and is a military veteran, but he became so disenchanted with presidential politics that he legally changed his name in order to run for president.\n\nHe said he doesn't like the candidates at the top of either ticket and thinks Americans deserve better than the divisive, partisan system that dominates U.S. politics. And while his name won't appear on the Texas ballot because -- as we confirmed with the Secretary of State -- he didn't get the required 113,000 signatures, he expects to be an official write-in candidate here, and likely on the ballot in Tennessee where he said he did get the requisite signatures.\n\n\"It's not necessarily about drawing attention to my grievances,\" Else told ABC13, \"but about giving a place for anyone who shares these grievances to come together to a focal point. We have all this scattered, all these scattered opinions like life, going every which way, as my dad would say, and this name gives everybody something to point to, to channel, that being to one movement, to one message that could hopefully have a meaningful impact.\"\n\nSEE: Biden and Trump tied despite debate, as 67% call for president to drop out, poll shows\n\nHe revealed his running mate is a New Yorker living in Switzerland named Neal David Sutz. Sutz was impressed with Literally Anybody Else's message and wanted to join his efforts.\n\nWhile Else and Sutz know they can't win, they're hopeful their message has enough of an impact to shift thinking and get the attention of the traditional parties and how they run the country.\n\nYou can see more of Else's political points in an extended interview, on This Week in Texas this weekend.\n\nFor updates on this story, follow Tom Abrahams on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

I didn't say crosshairs. I meant bullseye, I meant focus on him. Focus on what he's doing.\"\n\nHe said he meant Democrats needed to look at Trump, his policies and the false statements he made during the presidential debate late last month.\n\nAccording to Politico, Mr Biden had said on a private donor call: \"I have one job, and that's to beat Donald Trump. I'm absolutely certain I'm the best person to be able to do that. So, we're done talking about the debate. It\u2019s time to put Trump in a bullseye.\"\n\nThroughout the interview, Mr Biden made it clear he would not be stepping aside in the presidential race - despite calls from members of his own party after his poor debate performance.\n\n\"I'm old,\" he lamented, while also noting he's only three years older than Trump. He said his mental acuity was fine and listed his accomplishments as president - but acknowledged he was working to reaffirm to Americans that he was up to the job.\n\n\"I understand why people say, 'God, he\u2019s 81 years old. Whoa. What's he going to be when he\u2019s 83 years old, 84 years?' It\u2019s a legitimate question to ask,\" he said.\n\nHe said he put his faith in the voters who overwhelmingly backed him in the Democratic primary. \"I listen to them.\"\n\nThe president has repeatedly called for Americans to \"lower the temperature\" since the shooting on Saturday, where Trump's ear was grazed by a bullet.\n\nOne crowd member was killed and two others were critically injured in the attack.\n\nAbout a dozen Republicans have blamed Mr Biden and other Democrats for inciting the attempt on Trump's life. Many have specifically cited the \"bullseye\" comment.\n\nJD Vance, who was announced as Trump's presidential running mate on Monday, said in the wake of the shooting that Democratic rhetoric about the Republican candidate \"led directly to President Trump's attempted assassination\".\n\nPresident Biden, in an Oval Office address on Sunday, denounced the attack and called for Americans to \"take a step back\", warning that \"political rhetoric in this country has gotten very heated\".\n\nWhen asked in the NBC interview if he had also taken a step back to examine his past remarks for anything \"that could incite people who are not balanced\", Mr Biden said the inflammatory rhetoric had not come from him.\n\n\"I've not engaged in that rhetoric,\" Mr Biden said. \"Now, my opponent is engaged in that rhetoric.\n\n\"How do you talk about the threat to democracy, which is real, when a president says things like he says? Do you just not say anything, because it may incite somebody?\n\n\"I am not the guy that said I want to be a dictator on day one, I am not the guy that refused to accept the outcome of the election.\"\n\nThe FBI has identified the gunman who targeted Trump as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, a kitchen worker from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, who is a registered Republican.\n\nA Secret Service sniper shot Crooks dead after he fired at the former president.",

        "text": "Biden should drop out, nearly two-thirds of Democrats say: AP-NORC Poll\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Nearly two-thirds of Democrats say President Joe Biden should withdraw from the presidential race and let his party nominate a different candidate, according to a new poll, sharply undercutting his post-debate claim that \u201caverage Democrats\u201d are still with him even if some \u201cbig names\u201d are turning on him.\n\nThe new survey by the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, conducted as Biden works to salvage his candidacy two weeks after his debate flop, also found that only about 3 in 10 Democrats are extremely or very confident that he has the mental capability to serve effectively as president, down slightly from 40% in an AP-NORC poll in February.\n\nThe findings underscore the challenges the 81-year-old president faces as he tries to silence calls from within his own party to leave the race and tries to convince Democrats that he\u2019s the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump. The poll was conducted mostly before Saturday\u2019s assassination attempt on Trump at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. It\u2019s unclear whether the shooting influenced people\u2019s views of Biden, but the small number of poll interviews completed after the shooting provided no early indication that his prospects improved.\n\nMeanwhile, as Vice President Kamala Harris receives additional scrutiny amid the talk about whether Biden should bow out, the poll found that her favorability rating is similar to his \u2014 but the share of Americans who have an unfavorable opinion of her is slightly lower.\n\nThe poll provides some evidence that Black Democrats are among Biden\u2019s strongest supporters, with roughly half in the survey saying he should continue running, compared to about 3 in 10 white and Hispanic Democrats. Overall, seven in 10 Americans think Biden should drop out, with Democrats only slightly less likely than Republicans and independents to say that he should make way for a new nominee.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\n\u201cI do have genuine concerns about his ability to hold the office,\u201d said Democrat Andrew Holcomb, 27, of Denver. \u201cI think he\u2019s frankly just too old for the job.\u201d\n\nAP AUDIO: Nearly two-thirds of Democrats want Biden to withdraw, new AP-NORC poll finds AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports a new poll sharply undercuts President Biden\u2019s claim that \u2018average Democrats\u2019 are still with him after his debate debacle.\n\nJanie Stapleton, a 50-year-old lifelong Democrat from Walls, Mississippi, held the opposite view, saying Biden is the \u201cbest candidate\u201d for president.\n\nPeople aren\u2019t just sour on Biden on as they size up their choices this election season.\n\nAbout 6 in 10 Americans want Trump to withdraw -- but relatively few Republicans are in that camp.\n\nAs for Biden, younger Democrats are especially likely to want to see him bow out \u2013 and to say they\u2019re dissatisfied with him. Three-quarters of Democrats under the age of 45 want Biden to drop out, compared to about 6 in 10 of those who are older.\n\n\u201cI just feel like these two individuals are a sad choice,\u201d said Alexi Mitchell, 35, a civil servant who lives in Virginia. She identifies as a Democratic-leaning independent, and while she thinks Biden is probably still mentally up to the job, she worries that the past few weeks\u2019 unraveling of support makes him a weak candidate, no matter what happens next. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t have control over his own party, that\u2019s a fatal flaw,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s put us in a bad position where Trump might win.\u201d\n\nDespite bullish talk from the Biden campaign heading into the debate, the faceoff only left the president in a deeper hole. Democrats are slightly more likely to say they\u2019re dissatisfied with Biden as their nominee now than they were before his halting performance. About half are dissatisfied, an uptick from about 4 in 10 in an AP-NORC poll from June.\n\nBy contrast, most Republicans \u2013 about 6 in 10 \u2013 came out of the debate very or somewhat satisfied with Trump as their candidate. Too few interviews were conducted after the assassination attempt to provide a clear indication of whether Republicans or Americans overall have rallied further around Trump since then.\n\nDavid Parrott, a Democrat from Soddy-Daisy, Tennessee, was willing to give Biden the benefit of the doubt given the president\u2019s age, but he still voiced concerns about a potential second term.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if he can make it another four years or not,\u201d said Parrott, a 58-year-old retiree. \u201cShouldn\u2019t he be sitting at his beach house taking it easy?\u201d\n\nAll of the recent churn has left Americans much more likely to think Trump is capable of winning the 2024 election than is Biden \u2013 42% to 18%. About a quarter thought the the two men equally capable of winning.\n\nEven Democrats are relatively dour about their party\u2019s prospects come November.\n\nOnly about a third of Democrats believe Biden is more capable of winning than is Trump. About 3 in 10 think the two are equally capable of winning and 16% say victory is more likely to go to the Republican. By contrast, Republicans are overwhelmingly convinced that Trump is in the best position to win.\n\nTrump also has the edge on Biden when Americans consider who is most capable of handling a crisis, 38% to 28%. And people are about equally divided on which candidate has the better vision for the country, with 35% saying Biden and 34% Trump.\n\nFor all of the disenchantment Biden is up against, the president insists it\u2019s not too late to turn things around, saying past presidents have come back from a deficit at this stage in the campaign. In an interview Tuesday with BET News, he said many voters haven\u2019t focused yet, adding, \u201cThe point is, we\u2019re just getting down to gametime right now.\u201d\n\nThe poll did also offer a bright spot for Biden: 40% of adults say he\u2019s more honest than Trump, while about 2 in 10 think the opposite.\n\nMost Democrats \u2014 around 6 in 10 \u2014 say that Vice President Harris would make a good president, while 22% think not and 2 in 10 don\u2019t know enough to say. The poll showed that 43% of U.S. adults have a favorable opinion of her, while 48% have an unfavorable opinion. Somewhat more have a negative view of Biden: approximately 6 in 10 Americans.\n\nThe survey was conducted before Trump selected freshman Sen. JD Vance of Ohio as his running mate. It showed that for most Americans, Vance is still an unknown. Six in 10 don\u2019t know enough about him to form an opinion, while 17% have a favorable view and 22% view him negatively.\n\n___\n\nThe poll of 1,253 adults was conducted July 11-15, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC\u2019s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.",

And Musk has written posts on X that attack the voting system, specifically saying that \u2014 quote \u2014 \"The system is designed to make it impossible to prove fraud. Mail-in and drop box ballot should not be allowed.\"\n\nNow, Musk has also amplified on X a baseless claim posted by another user that said \u2014 quote \u2014 \"The number of voters registering without a photo I.D. is skyrocketing in three key swing states, Arizona, Texas and Pennsylvania.\"\n\nAnd Stephen Richer, Maricopa County recorder, responded specifically on X to Musk, pointing out that voter rolls have actually decreased in Arizona, again, refuting that claim that Musk was amplifying.\n\nI spoke to Stephen Richer today about the impact of Musk posting and reposting these types of inaccuracies. And he told us that, ultimately, he's concerned that a lot of people are going to believe this and that it makes the job of election officials like himself unsustainable.\n\nStephen Richer (R), Maricopa County, Arizona, Recorder: Despite the millions of dollars that we have invested and the countless hours that we have invested to tours, to livestreams, to tele-town halls, to videos, to articles, to reports, it doesn't seem like we have made a significant dent in this culture, in this movement, in this false characterization of election administration.\n\nAt some point, people are going to throw up their hands and just stop, stop trying.

        "text": "What happens if a presidential candidate dies?\nWhat happens if a presidential candidate dies?\n\nYes, it is a morbid question. Still, President Joe Biden is 81 and former President Donald Trump is 78.\n\nHaving two elderly leaders competing for a four-year term in the White House, coupled with the assassination attempt on Trump Saturday and news on Wednesday that Biden has COVID for a third time, raises the logical question of who decides the nominee if a candidate dies or is incapacitated during their campaign.\n\nThe answer: It depends on when in the process it happens, election experts told USA TODAY. But the major political parties have rules in place to make the process as smooth as possible.\n\n\u201cAny one who is planning an election \u2026 knows this is a possibility,\u201d said Rebecca Green, an associate professor of election law at William & Mary. \u201cMost states have developed procedures that are used relatively routinely.\u201d\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nIf a presidential candidate dies before the convention\n\nThe GOP officially nominated Trump Monday at the Republican National Convention, so this part doesn't apply to him. But it does for Biden because the Democratic National Convention delegates haven't voted yet.\n\nIf the incumbent Democratic president were to die or become incapacitated before they vote, his delegates would essentially be released and the party would hash out who the nominee would be at the Chicago convention that runs Aug. 19-22. Presidential hopefuls would have to work to convince the party faithful representing each state to support their bid.\n\n\u201cIt is essentially a party matter,\u201d reminiscent of how candidates were chosen before primaries became prevalent over the last few decades, said John Fortier, the principal contributor to the American Enterprise Institute-Brookings Election Reform Project.\n\nMore:Joe Biden has everyone worried. Let\u2019s talk about aging, for real.\n\nIf a presidential candidate dies between the convention and Election Day\n\nIf a Democratic presidential nominee dies between the convention and Election Day, the Democratic National Committee would choose a candidate in consultation with the party's House and Senate leaders and the Democratic Governors Association.\n\nDemocrats have done this just once before, in 1972. That's when presidential candidate George McGovern decided to replace his running mate, Missouri's Thomas Eagleton, on the Democratic ticket after news broke that Eagleton had been hospitalized for depression and underwent electroshock treatment.\n\nRobert Sargent Shriver was selected as the Democratic nominee for vice president at a special meeting of the Democratic National Committee a little more than two weeks after the convention in Washington, D.C.\n\nFor the GOP, Republican National Committee members would vote by delegation to select a candidate. The delegates would possibly be recalled to vote in person\n\nWhere it starts to get difficult is if a candidate dies or becomes incapacitated after states have already begun to print ballots. By early September, ballots are being printed and sent out to comply with federal laws ensuring that Americans living overseas, including members of the military, get a chance to vote.\n\n\u201cDifferent states have different rules for how to replace candidates and when,\u201d Greene said.\n\nMore:Joe Biden is old. So is Donald Trump. So are millions of other American workers\n\nEven if it is too late to remove a name from ballots, the Democrats and Republicans would name a new nominee as their standard-bearer.\n\nFortier said it's important to remember that when people cast a vote, they aren't voting for a candidate, but for electors who will vote for their preferred party in the Electoral College.\n\nBecause of that, electors in most states could simply vote for the replacement nominee, regardless of which name is actually on the ballot, he said.\n\nNevertheless, it gets complicated once again if a candidate dies or becomes incapacitated when electors vote because of state laws restricting who the electors can vote for.\n\n\u201cThere is a potential for some confusion,\u201d said Ned Foley, director of the Election Law Program at Ohio State. That's because about a dozen states either don\u2019t specifically address what electors should do if a candidate has dies, or have laws obligating electors to vote for the name on the ballot rather than the party\u2019s nominee, he said\n\nStates might move to change the law, or the question of who electors should vote for could be decided in state courts, he said.\n\nIf a presidential candidate dies before Congress meets on Jan. 6\n\nThe biggest complication would be if a candidate would die or become incapacitated between when the Electoral College votes in early December and when Congress meets on Jan. 6 to certify the results of the election.\n\nIt's \"not 100% clear Congress would count the votes for somebody who is deceased,\u201d Fortier said. And if neither candidate has the 270 Electoral College votes needed to secure the presidency, the results of the election would then be decided by the House in what is called a contingent election.\n\nIf a president-elect dies or is incapacitated after Congress votes to certify the election results, the 20th Amendment would kick in, meaning the order of succession would be in place. The vice president would step in and be sworn in as president on Inauguration Day.",

        "text": "Joe Biden has COVID. Here\u2019s what someone over 80 can expect\nIf US politics leading up to the 2024 presidential election was a Hollywood thriller, it would be a movie full of plot twists and surprises. The latest twist is President Joe Biden has COVID and is isolating at home.\n\nBiden\u2019s doctor says his symptoms are mild and include a runny nose, cough and generally feeling unwell. His temperature, oxygen levels and respiratory rate are said to be normal.\n\nBiden, who has been diagnosed with COVID twice before, has received his COVID vaccine and booster shots, and has taken the first dose of the antiviral drug Paxlovid.\n\nNo doubt, Biden will be receiving the best of medical care. Yet, as much recent media coverage reminds us, he is 81 years old.\n\nSo let\u2019s look at what it means for an 81-year-old man to have COVID in 2024. Of course, Biden is not just any man, but we\u2019ll come to that later.\n\nLuckily, it\u2019s not 2020\n\nIf we were back in 2020, a COVID diagnosis at this age would have been a big deal.\n\nThis was a time before COVID vaccines, before specific COVID treatments and before we knew as much about COVID as we do today. Back then, being over 80 and being infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus (the virus that causes COVID) represented a significant threat to your health.\n\nIt was very clear early in the pandemic that your chances of getting severe disease and dying increased with age. The early data suggested that if you were over 80 and infected, you had about a 15% likelihood of dying from the illness.\n\nAlso, if you did develop severe disease, we didn\u2019t have a lot in the toolkit to deal with your infection.\n\nRemember, former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson ended up in the ICU with his COVID infection in April 2020, despite being 55 at the time. That\u2019s a much younger age than Biden is now.\n\nFormer US President Donald Trump also had what was understood to be a very severe case of COVID in October 2020. He was 74 at the time.\n\nHow things have changed\n\nSo let\u2019s wind the clock forward to 2024. A lot has happened in four years.\n\nCOVID is still a disease that needs to be taken seriously. And for some people with other health conditions (for instance, people with heart disease or diabetes) it poses more of a threat. And of course we know more about the well-publicised longer term effects of COVID.\n\nBut the threat COVID poses to an individual is far less now than it has ever been.\n\nMore of us have some immunity\n\nFirst, most people have some immunity to COVID now, whether this has come from vaccination or prior infection, and for many both.\n\nThe fact that your immune system has had some exposure to the virus is transformative in how you respond to infection. Yes, there\u2019s the ongoing problem of waning immunity over time and the virus mutating meaning you need to have regular booster vaccines. But as your immune system has \u201cseen\u201d the virus before it allows it to respond more effectively. This means the threat posed by infection has fallen drastically.\n\nWe know Biden has received his booster shots. Boosters have been shown to offer substantial protection against severe illness and death and are particularly important for older age groups.\n\nNow we have antivirals\n\nSecond, we also have antiviral medicines, such as Paxlovid, which is effective in reducing the likelihood of severe illness from COVID if taken soon after developing symptoms.\n\nIn one study, if taken soon after infection, Paxlovid reduced the likelihood of severe illness or death by 89%. So it is highly recommended for those at higher risk of severe illness. As we know, Biden is taking Paxlovid.\n\nPaxlovid has also been associated with rebound symptoms. This is when a person looks to have recovered from infection only to have symptoms reappear. Biden experienced this in 2022.\n\nThe good news is that even if this occurs in most instances the symptoms associated with the recurrence tend to be mild.\n\nBiden would have the best care\n\nThe other factor of course is that Biden would have access to some of the world\u2019s best medical care.\n\nIf his symptoms were to become more severe or any complications were to develop, you can be assured he would get the best treatment.\n\nSo is Biden\u2019s diagnosis news? Well of course, given all the speculation about his health. But in terms of COVID being a major threat to Biden\u2019s health, there are no indications it should be.",

        "text": "Polling Insight: 4 Key Takeaways About Hispanic Women Voters Nationally and in Arizona\nHispanic Americans account for half the growth of the voting-age population in the U.S. since the 2020 presidential election, and their diversity of opinion and experiences is as great as their numbers. Former President Trump made gains with Hispanic voters between the last two presidential elections, though an analysis shows they voted for President Biden by wide margins in key states in 2020. Across racial and ethnic groups, women voters overwhelmingly cite inflation as the most important issue determining their vote and are similarly dissatisfied with their options for president. However, women of color, including both Hispanic and Black women, are less motivated to vote and less likely to say they plan to vote in this election. Hispanic women in particular are an important segment of American voters, as they have historically turned out at higher rates than Hispanic men and may be more motivated to vote in this election by the inclusion of abortion and other reproductive health measures on state-level ballots. In a close election, the turnout of Hispanic women voters may tip the scale toward either candidate.\n\nThis polling insight from the KFF Survey of Women Voters is based on analysis of Hispanic women voters nationally and in Arizona, a key battleground state for the upcoming presidential election where it is projected that one in four voters will be Hispanic . This analysis finds the potential state ballot measure in Arizona which would enshrine abortion rights may motivate younger Hispanic women in particular to cast their vote.\n\nThe KFF Survey of Women Voters Dashboard includes more analyses from the survey, as well as the topline and methodology.\n\n#1: Inflation Is the Most Important Election Issue for Hispanic Women Voters; Most Worry About Affording Basic Expenses\n\nEconomic issues are top of mind for Hispanic women voters across the country leading into the presidential election, as majorities say they worry \u201ca lot\u201d about affording basic expenses for them and their family, including food and groceries (64%), rent or mortgage (63%), the cost of health care (60%), monthly utilities (56%), and childcare (54% among those with children under age 18). Similar shares of Black women voters say they worry \u201ca lot\u201d about most of these household expenses, while White women voters are less likely than both Black and Hispanic women voters to express worry about affording the items asked about in this survey.\n\nAmericans overall have been affected by growing inflation rates after the economy struggled to recover after the COVID-19 pandemic, peaking at 9.1% in June 2022 . Over half (56%) of Hispanic women voters say \u201cinflation, including the rising cost of household expenses\u201d is the most important issue determining their vote in the upcoming election, and the Democratic Party has an advantage over the Republican Party when it comes to addressing the cost of household expenses for this group (35% vs. 22%). However, many still say neither party does a better job (43%).\n\nThe KFF Survey of Women Voters Dashboard displays top issues determining the vote of Hispanic women voters and other key groups of women voters.\n\n#2: Hispanic Women Voters Are Frustrated, Dissatisfied With Options for President; Younger Voters Are Particularly Disaffected\n\nAbout six in ten Hispanic women voters nationally say they are \u201canxious\u201d (60%) or \u201cfrustrated\u201d (57%) about the upcoming presidential election, while half (54%) say they are \u201chopeful,\u201d and a much smaller share are \u201centhusiastic\u201d (35%). Negative feelings surrounding the election may be related to dissatisfaction with the candidates themselves. The poll, fielded before the first presidential debate between President Biden and former President Trump, found over half (55%) of Hispanic women voters say they are dissatisfied with their options for president, including a quarter (27%) who say they are \u201cnot at all\u201d satisfied.\n\nYounger Hispanic women voters are particularly disaffected this election cycle. One-third (32%) of those ages 18 to 44 say they are less motivated to vote compared to previous presidential elections (19% of Hispanic women voters ages 45 and older respond similarly), and a quarter (26%) say they would not vote if the election were held today. Younger Hispanic women are also more likely to identify as independent compared to those 45 and older (40% vs. 25%). This patten is consistent across racial and ethnic groups nationally, with younger women more likely than their older counterparts to identify as independent.\n\nIn addition, the KFF Survey of Women Voters, which was fielded in late May to early June, finds lack of motivation to vote among younger Hispanic women may be related to their mixed views on the candidates\u2019 records. Half (52%) of Hispanic women voters ages 18 to 44 say they were better off financially during Trump\u2019s presidency, compared to one in ten who say they are better off now under President Biden and about four in ten (37%) who say there is no difference. Financial security appears top of mind for this voting bloc, among whom six in ten cite inflation as the top issue determining their vote (62%).\n\nThough Trump may have a comparative advantage on voters\u2019 perceptions of their financial situations during his presidency, Biden does better among younger Hispanic women voters on reproductive health issues. This group is over twice as likely to say they trust Biden over Trump to do a better job deciding policy related to abortion access (40% vs. 19%) and birth control access (45% vs. 18%) in the U.S. Though once again, four in ten say they trust neither candidate to do a better job in each of these areas (41% and 37%, respectively).\n\n#3: In Arizona, a Key Battleground State, the Arizona Right to Abortion Initiative May Drive Turnout Among Younger Hispanic Women Who Support Abortion Rights\n\nAnalysis suggests that turnout of young Hispanic voters in Arizona was a key part of President Biden\u2019s narrow victory in the state in 2020. The candidate who wins the 11 electoral college votes in this swing state in 2024 could tip the scale for who wins the presidency, especially if this crucial voting bloc turns out once again.\n\nFielded in late May to early June, the KFF Survey of Women Voters finds about one third (32%) of younger Hispanic women voters ages 18 to 44 in Arizona say there is a 50-50 chance or less of voting in the upcoming November election. Just 7% of older Hispanic women voters, ages 45 and older, say the same. These younger voters are also more likely to not affiliate with either political party (40% vs. 14% who identify as independents). These patterns among younger Hispanic women voters in Arizona are also found among this group nationally.\n\nIf the presidential candidates are not motivating younger Hispanic women in Arizona to vote, a citizen-initiated amendment to the state constitution enshrining abortion rights, which will likely appear on the ballot, may encourage this group to turn out. A large majority (82%) of Hispanic women voters ages 18 to 44 say they support the Arizona Right to Abortion Initiative, which would establish a fundamental right to abortion until fetal viability, typically between 23 and 25 weeks of pregnancy. Notably, two-thirds (67%) of younger Hispanic women voters say they would be more motivated to vote if it makes it on the state ballot. Smaller shares of Hispanic women ages 45 and older say they support the measure (46%) and would be more motivated to vote if it is on the ballot (45%).\n\n#4: President Biden Has the Advantage Among Hispanic Women in Arizona on Abortion, Though Many Still Trust \u201cNeither Candidate\u201d\n\nDuring the first presidential debate in June (held after the field period for the survey), both President Biden and former President Trump reaffirmed their stances on abortion. Biden declared his commitment to restoring Roe v. Wade, which would secure a federal right to abortion until fetal viability, akin to the Arizona Right to Abortion Initiative which young Hispanic women in the state overwhelmingly support. In contrast, Trump stated the legal status of abortion should be left to the states to decide, a policy stance that 77% of younger Hispanic women voters from Arizona oppose. A majority (59%) of Hispanic women voters in Arizona, regardless of age, say this year\u2019s election for president will have a \u201cmajor impact\u201d on access to abortion and reproductive health care in their state. However, while younger Hispanic women voters are twice as likely to say they trust Biden over Trump when it comes to deciding policy related to abortion and birth control access in the U.S., three in ten or more still say they trust \u201cneither\u201d candidate.\n\nHispanic women who cast their ballot in the upcoming 2024 presidential election will be deciding between two candidates whose incoming tenure will address policy related to inflation, threats to democracy, immigration, and abortion \u2013 all top issues determining the vote of this growing voting bloc. In Arizona, a state with a growing Hispanic electorate that is majority younger and female, it is unclear whether turnout of young Hispanic women who may show up to vote for the Arizona abortion rights measure will translate to an advantage for either candidate. With substantial shares declaring trust in neither candidate to address reproductive health issues, alongside disaffection towards the election overall, the presidential nominees will each need to convince this bloc of largely disaffected voters that his presidency will best address their needs and top issues.",

Legal expert says it\u2019s more complicated\nCan Donald Trump or Joe Biden play whatever music they want at a rally or convention? Legal expert says it\u2019s more complicated Musicians and politicians have frequently clashed over whose music gets played at political rallies. A Northeastern law expert explains how music gets played at these events \u2013\u2013 and what musicians do to push back. Former President Donald Trump has been told by many musicians he can\u2019t use their music during campaign events. AP Photo/Evan Vucci\n\nThe Republican National Convention is in full swing, with the party\u2019s nominee for president, former President Donald Trump, and vice president, J.D. Vance, taking the stage alongside other major players in Republican Party politics.\n\nHowever, even with wall-to-wall news coverage of the event, one thing often gets lost when it comes to these kinds of high-profile political events: Whose music is blaring from the loudspeakers?\n\nIt turns out that what music gets played at a political rally or campaign event involves more consideration \u2013\u2013 and legal know-how \u2013\u2013 than you might think. It\u2019s an area where the law, performing arts and politics intersect in sometimes uncomfortable ways, particularly for a politician like Trump, who has an entire Wikipedia page dedicated to listing musicians who oppose his use of their music.\n\nSo, what rights do politicians have when it comes to playing music during rallies, conventions or campaign events? The answer, says Alexandra Roberts, a professor of law and media at Northeastern University, is a little complicated.\n\nA politician can\u2019t just play any song they want because they are at a public venue. Just like any other kind of event, the organizers of political campaigns need to secure a license to get the right to publicly perform a song.",

        "text": "Kellyanne Conway\nAmerican political consultant, pollster (born 1967)\n\nKellyanne Elizabeth Conway (n\u00e9e Fitzpatrick; born January 20, 1967) is an American political consultant and pollster who served as Senior Counselor to the President in the administration of Donald Trump from 2017 to 2020.[1][2][3][4] She was previously Trump's campaign manager, having been appointed in August 2016; Conway is the first woman to have run a successful U.S. presidential campaign.[5] She has previously held roles as campaign manager and strategist in the Republican Party and was formerly president and CEO of the Polling Company/WomanTrend.[6]\n\nConway lived in Trump World Tower from 2001 to 2008 and conducted private polls for Trump in late 2013 when he was considering running for governor of New York. In the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, Conway initially endorsed Ted Cruz and chaired a pro-Cruz political action committee.[7][8][9][10] After Cruz withdrew from the race, Trump appointed Conway as a senior advisor and later campaign manager.[11][12] On December 22, 2016, Trump announced that Conway would join his administration as counselor to the president.[13] On November 29, 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that Conway would oversee White House efforts to combat the opioid overdose epidemic.[14][15]\n\nAfter Trump's inauguration, Conway was embroiled in a series of controversies: using the phrase \"alternative facts\" to describe fictitious and disproven attendance numbers for Trump's inauguration; speaking multiple times of a \"Bowling Green massacre\" that never occurred; and claiming that Michael Flynn had the full confidence of the president hours before he was dismissed. Members of Congress from both parties called for an investigation of an apparent ethics violation after she publicly endorsed commercial products associated with the president's daughter, Ivanka Trump.[16] In June 2019, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel recommended that Conway be fired for \"unprecedented\" multiple violations of the Hatch Act of 1939.[17]\n\nIn August 2020, Conway left the administration. This came after months of a public feud between herself and her teenage daughter, Claudia, who lambasted her in the media, politically and personally, and threatened to seek legal emancipation.[18][19][20] In 2022, Conway joined Fox News as a contributor. She frequently appears as a guest/host on a variety of programs, including Hannity, The Five, Outnumbered, The Big Weekend Show, and more. Conway also contributed to Fox's 2022 Midterm Election coverage. Since 2024, Conway has been paid by the Club for Growth to advocate on behalf of TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance.\n\nIn July 2024, Fox News announced that Conway will host a weekly program on the network's streaming platform, Fox Nation, called Here's The Deal with Kellyanne Conway.\n\nEarly life\n\nKellyanne Elizabeth Fitzpatrick was born on January 20, 1967, in Camden, New Jersey, to Diane (n\u00e9e DiNatale) and John Fitzpatrick, and grew up in the nearby Atco section of Waterford Township, New Jersey.[21][22][23] Conway's father had German, English, and Irish ancestry, while her mother is of Italian descent;[24] John Fitzpatrick owned a small trucking company, and Diane worked at a bank. Conway's parents divorced when she was three,[25][26] and she was raised by her mother, grandmother, and two unmarried aunts in Atco. She graduated from St. Joseph High School in 1985 as class valedictorian in a high school with 140 students, total. In high school, she also sang in the choir, played field hockey, worked on floats for parades, and was a cheerleader.[27] A 1992 New Jersey Organized Crime Commission report identified Conway's grandfather, Jimmy \"The Brute\" DiNatale, as a mob associate of the Philadelphia crime family; DiNatale did not reside with Conway's grandmother, Conway, and the rest of her family.[25] Conway's cousin, Mark DeMarco, has stated that while in high school, Conway ordered members of the football team to stop bullying him; according to DeMarco, the bullying stopped.[28] Her family is Catholic.[22][29]\n\nConway credits her experience working for eight summers on a blueberry farm in Hammonton, New Jersey, for teaching her a strong work ethic. \"The faster you went, the more money you'd make,\" she said. At age 16, she won the New Jersey Blueberry Princess pageant. At age 20, she won the World Champion Blueberry Packing competition: \"Everything I learned about life and business started on that farm.\"[29]\n\nConway graduated magna cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in political science from Trinity College, Washington, D.C. (now Trinity Washington University), where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.[30] She earned a Juris Doctor with honors from the George Washington University Law School in 1992.[31] After graduation, she served as a judicial clerk for Judge Richard A. Levie[32] of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.[33][34][35]\n\nEarly career\n\nConway entered the polling business when she was in law school, working as a research assistant for Wirthlin Group, a Republican polling firm.[31] After graduating, she initially considered working for a law firm, but chose to work for Luntz Research Companies instead.[36] While a student at Trinity College, she had met and become friends with Frank Luntz, the founder, on a year abroad at Oxford University.[36] In 1995, she founded her own firm, the Polling Company. Conway's company has consulted on consumer trends, often trends regarding women. Conway's clients have included Vaseline, American Express and Hasbro.[37]\n\nIn the 1990s, Conway, along with other young conservative women Laura Ingraham, Barbara Olson, and Ann Coulter,[31] helped turn punditry into \"stylish stardom\" in both Washington and cable television[38][39] and credited with setting forth Washington, D.C.'s \"sexual awakening.\"[40] In another review of the era in the capital, Conway (then known as Fitzpatrick) put it that her \"broad mind and small waist have not switched places\".[41] Conway, Ingraham, and Coulter were sometimes called \"pundettes\",[42] and appeared on Bill Maher's Politically Incorrect.[31]\n\nConway worked for Representative Jack Kemp; Senator Fred Thompson;[35][better source needed] Vice President Dan Quayle;[43] Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich; and Representative (later Vice President) Mike Pence.[37] She worked as the senior advisor to Gingrich during his unsuccessful 2012 United States presidential election campaign.[44] Another client in 2012 was U.S. Senate candidate Todd Akin.[45]\n\nConway in 2015\n\nIn addition to her political opinion research work, Conway has directed demographic and attitudinal survey projects for trade associations and private companies, including American Express, ABC News, Major League Baseball, and Ladies Home Journal. Her firm The Polling Company also includes WomanTrend, a research and consulting division.[35]\n\nConway has appeared as a commentator on polling and the political scene, having appeared on ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS, CNN, MSNBC, NY1, and the Fox News Channel, in addition to various radio programs. She received the Washington Post's \"Crystal Ball\" award for accurately predicting the outcome of the 2004 election.[46]\n\nConway has been criticized as a spin doctor of high prominence, particularly in her role as cable TV spokesperson for the Trump Administration.[47] She has been lauded as a \"Trump whisperer.\"[8] As part of their long-running feud with Donald Trump,[48] the MSNBC show Morning Joe publicly \"banned\" Conway in February 2017.[49]\n\n2016 presidential election\n\nTed Cruz support and endorsement\n\nWhen the 2016 election campaigns got underway, Conway had been acquainted with Donald Trump for years because she lived in Trump World Tower from 2001 to 2008 and sat on the condo board.[8] Yet she initially endorsed Ted Cruz in the 2016 Republican presidential primary and chaired a pro-Cruz political action committee known as Keep the Promise I, which was almost entirely funded by businessman Robert Mercer.[50][51] Conway's organization criticized Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump as \"extreme\" and \"not a conservative\".[9][10] On January 25, 2016, Conway criticized Trump as \"a man who seems to be offending his way to the nomination.\"[52] On January 26, Conway criticized Trump's use of eminent domain, saying, \"Donald Trump has literally bulldozed over the little guy to get his way.\"[53]\n\nIn mid-June 2016, Cruz suspended his campaign and Conway left.[54]\n\nTrump campaign\n\nOn July 1, 2016, Trump announced that he had hired Conway for a senior advisory position on his presidential campaign.[55] Conway was expected to advise Trump on how to better appeal to female voters.[55] On August 19, following the resignation of Paul Manafort, Trump named Conway the campaign's third campaign manager.[37][56] She served in this capacity for 10 weeks, through the November 8 general election, and was the first woman to successfully run an American presidential campaign,[57] and the first woman to run a Republican general election presidential campaign.[56] Saturday Night Live started satirizing her in October 2016, portrayed by Kate McKinnon.[58][59][60] In a January 2017 interview, Conway acknowledged the SNL parody by noting that, \"Kate McKinnon clearly sees the road to the future runs through me and not Hillary.\"[61][62]\n\nPresidential transition\n\nOn November 10, 2016, Conway publicly tweeted that Trump had offered her a White House job.[63] \"I can have any job I want\", she said on November 28.[64] On November 24, Conway tweeted that she was \"Receiving deluge of social media & private comms re: Romney. Some Trump loyalists warn against Romney as sec of state\" with a link to an article on Trump loyalists' discontent for the 2012 nominee. Conway told CNN she was only tweeting what she has shared with President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence in private.[65]\n\nOn November 28, two top sources at the Trump transition team told media outlets that Trump \"was furious\" at Conway for media comments she made on Trump administration cabinet appointments.[66] The following day, however, Trump released a written statement stating that the campaign sources were wrong and that he had expressed disappointment at her critical comments on Romney.[67] CNBC reported on November 28 that senior officials in the Trump transition \"have reportedly been growing frustrated by Conway's failure to become a team player.\"[64]\n\nOn December 1, Conway appeared with senior aides of the Trump campaign at Harvard Kennedy School for a forum on the 2016 presidential race; the quadrennial post-presidential election forum has been held at the School of Government since 1972. Sitting across from Conway were senior Clinton campaign aides, including Clinton's campaign manager Robby Mook. As tempers began to flare, the forum escalated into a \"shouting match\"; during one exchange, Clinton senior strategist Joel Benenson said \"The fact of the matter is that more Americans voted for Hillary Clinton than for Donald Trump.\" Conway replied to Benenson while looking at the Trump aides: \"Hey, guys, we won. You don't have to respond. He was the better candidate. That's why he won.\"[68]\n\nIn early December, Conway claimed that Hillary Clinton supporters were making death threats against her.[69] Consequently, Trump assigned Secret Service to protect her.[70][71][72] Conway gave up her Secret Service protection in September 2017 due to \"reduction in threats.\"[73][74][75]\n\nWhite House advisor\n\nConway speaking to press outside the White House in 2019\n\nInauguration fight\n\nAccording to eyewitnesses, Conway allegedly punched a tuxedo-clad man at an exclusive inauguration ball just hours after Trump was sworn in as president.[76][77] In an attempt to break up a scuffle, Conway stepped between two men, but they would not break up the fight, and Conway apparently punched one of them in the face with closed fists at least three times.[78]\n\nIt was not immediately clear what triggered the fistfight and a Trump spokeswoman did not return a request for comment.[79]\n\n\"Alternative facts\"\n\nDuring a Meet the Press interview two days after Trump's presidential inauguration, Conway used the phrase \"alternative facts\" to defend statements made by White House press secretary Sean Spicer regarding the inauguration's crowd size.[80][81][82] Conway's phrase reminded some of \"Newspeak\", an obfuscatory language style that is a key element of the society portrayed in George Orwell's dystopian novel 1984.[83] Soon after Conway's interview, sales of the book had increased by 9,500%, which The New York Times and others attributed to Conway's use of the phrase, making it the number-one bestseller on Amazon.com.[84]\n\nThe Guardian noted that \"[a] search of several online legal dictionaries, however, did not yield any results for the term.\"[85]\n\nBowling Green massacre\n\nOn February 2, 2017, Conway appeared in a television news show interview on Hardball with Chris Matthews. In order to justify President Trump's immigration ban, she referenced an event allegedly perpetrated by Iraqi terrorists she termed the \"Bowling Green massacre\". Such an event never took place.[86][87] Vox suggested Conway was referring to the 2011 arrest of two Iraqi refugees in Bowling Green, Kentucky.[87] Conway stated the next day that she meant to say \"Bowling Green terrorists\", both of whom had pleaded guilty to carrying out and supporting attacks on American soldiers in Iraq.[88] There was never any suggestion that they had planned to carry out attacks in the United States.[89]\n\nOn February 5, 2017, New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen argued that, given repeated misstatements of fact, Conway should cease being booked as a guest on television news shows. CNN opted not to book Conway as a guest that day because of what the network said were \"serious questions about her credibility.\"[90][91]\n\nEthics violations under the Hatch Act\n\nThe Hatch Act of 1939 states that federal government employees must not advocate their political beliefs while representing a public office. Violating such a law can result in such an employee being removed from public office, but not jailed.[92] Conway has been accused of breaching the act on several occasions:\n\nCommercial promotion\n\nOn February 9, 2017, during an appearance on Fox & Friends, Conway discussed department store Nordstrom's decision to drop products supplied by Ivanka Trump's business. \"Go buy Ivanka's stuff is what I would tell you\", said Conway; she elaborated \"It's a wonderful line. I own some of it. I'm going to give a free commercial here: Go buy it today, everybody. You can find it online\".[93][94] Within hours, two organizations filed formal ethics complaints against Conway for violating federal law prohibiting use of a federal position \"for the endorsement of any product, service or enterprise\".[95] Public Citizen asked the Office of Governmental Ethics (OGE) to investigate, saying that Conway's remarks reflected \"an on-going careless regard of the conflicts of interest laws and regulations of some members of the Trump family and Trump Administration\". The group's president, Robert Weissman, declared, \"Since she said it was an advertisement, that both eliminates any question about whether outsiders are unfairly reading into what's being said, and two, it makes clear that wasn't an inadvertent remark\".[96] Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington filed a similar complaint with the OGE and with the White House Counsel's Office;[97] the group's executive director, Noah Bookbinder, stated \"This seems to us to be about as clear-cut a violation as you can find\".[98]\n\nHarvard constitutional law professor Laurence Tribe told The New York Times \"You couldn't think of a clearer example of violating the ban of using your government position as kind of a walking billboard for products or services offered by a private individual,\" adding \"She is attempting quite crudely to enrich Ivanka and therefore the president's family.\"[98] Chris Lu, deputy secretary of labor in the Obama administration, complained to Jason Chaffetz, chair of the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, that Conway had violated federal ethics laws,[99] also saying on Twitter that, under Obama, \"If we did what @KellyannePolls did, we would've been fired\".[100] Richard Painter, chief ethics attorney for George W. Bush, declined to say whether he thought Conway's statements broke the law, but that such actions would not have been tolerated in the Bush administration. \"The events of the past week demonstrate that there is no intent on the part of the president, his family or the White House staff to make meaningful distinctions between his official capacity as president and the Trump family business\".[98] At the regularly scheduled afternoon press briefing, Sean Spicer told reporters that \"Kellyanne has been counseled, and that's all we are going to go with ... She's been counseled on the subject, and that's it.\"[101] In a direct rebuke to Spicer, Conway tweeted that Trump \"likes 'counselor' more than 'counseled.'\"[102][103]\n\nConway's comments drew bipartisan Congressional condemnation. Chaffetz, a Republican, called them \"clearly over the line\" and \"unacceptable\". Cummings, a Democrat and the committee's ranking member, called them \"jaw-dropping\".[104] Both Chaffetz and Cummings wrote the OGE on February 9, 2017, requesting that Conway's behavior be investigated and that the office recommend \"suggested disciplinary action, if warranted\".[16]\n\nOn November 24, 2017, Walter Shaub, the former director of the OGE, said that he filed an ethics complaint against Conway.[105] He argued that Conway violated the Hatch Act when she criticized Doug Jones, a candidate in the 2017 U.S. Senate special election in Alabama.[105] On March 6, 2018, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) \u2013 led by Trump appointee Henry Kerner \u2013 issued its final report, determining that Conway violated the Hatch Act in two television interviews in November and December 2017.[106][107]\n\nConway continued to make frequent television appearances and comment on political topics. In May 2019, Conway declared: \"If you\u2019re trying to silence me through the Hatch Act, it's not going to work ... Let me know when the jail sentence starts\".[108]\n\nOn June 13, 2019, the OSC formally recommended that Conway be removed from federal service, citing multiple Hatch Act violations by Conway since the preparation of its 2018 report, \"by disparaging Democratic presidential candidates while speaking in her official capacity during television interviews and on social media\". The OSC noted her criticism from February to May 2019 of candidates such as Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, Beto O'Rourke, Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden and Kirsten Gillibrand, and also called her violations \"egregious, notorious, and ongoing\". The OSC noted that this was the first time they \"had to issue multiple reports to the President concerning Hatch Act violations by the same individual\".[17][109][110] In an interview, Kerner characterized his agency's recommendation as unprecedented, adding, \"You know what else is unprecedented? Kellyanne Conway\u2019s behavior.\"[17]\n\nDue to Conway's status as a presidential appointee, the OSC was unable to take any steps to implement its recommendation, but it was submitted to the President for consideration.[111][112][113] The White House immediately rejected the finding and demanded that it be withdrawn by the OSC.[114] Trump said he thought the recommendation was \"very unfair, it's called freedom of speech.\"[115]\n\nOn June 26, 2019, Conway did not appear at a hearing by the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, leading that committee to issue a subpoena for her. At that hearing, Special Counsel Henry Kerner testified that Conway had been found guilty of two Hatch Act violations in 2018 and 11 in 2019. In comparison, during the eight years of the Obama administration, only two federal employees were found guilty of violating the Hatch Act, with one violation each.[116]\n\nOn February 13, 2017, Conway claimed that former national security advisor Michael Flynn had the president's \"full confidence\". Hours later, Flynn resigned.[117] The following day, Conway claimed Flynn had offered to resign, but White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Trump had asked Flynn for his resignation.[117] It was then reported that Conway had allegedly leaked negative stories about Spicer to the press.[118]\n\nConway came under widespread criticism because her comments about Flynn had been so inaccurate. On February 15, 2017, Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin said Conway should be banned from future television appearances. \"In recent days, George Stephanopoulos and Matt Lauer blasted her directly, essentially calling her a fabulist. Given all that, it would be irresponsible for any news show to put her out there, suggesting she really does not know what is going on at any given moment\", Rubin wrote.[119] Also, on February 15, the MSNBC news show Morning Joe officially banned her from future appearances. The show's primary host Joe Scarborough said the decision to ban Conway from the show was based on her being \"out of the loop\" and \"in none of the key meetings\". He added \"She's not briefed. She's just saying things just to get in front of the TV to prove her relevance.\"[49] The show's co-host Mika Brzezinski said, \"I don't believe in fake news, or information that is not true... every time I've ever seen her on television, something's askew, off or incorrect.\"[49]\n\nFor the week following her Flynn comments, she did not appear on any television shows, and it was reported that the White House had sidelined Conway.[117] Denying the report, White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders told CNNMoney that Conway was going to make many appearances during the week, and Conway told CNN journalist Dylan Byers that she would be appearing on Fox News that evening.[117] The week-long absence from television finally ended when she appeared on an episode of Hannity during the Conservative Political Action Conference.[120]\n\nOval Office couch photograph\n\nConway came under criticism when she was photographed sitting on an Oval Office couch with her legs folded beneath her\u2014shoes pressed against the upholstery\u2014during President Trump's meeting with leaders from historically black colleges and universities.[121][122] Some observers suggested the sitting position was a sign of disrespect and a lack of decorum.[123] Body language expert Patti Wood asserted that Conway's posture was not only rude but \"rather sexual\" and a sign that she \"doesn't have to follow the rules\" because she was \"buddies with Trump.\"[124] Conway later addressed the controversy with Lou Dobbs, saying that she was asked to take photographs of the meeting from a certain angle and that she certainly meant \"no disrespect.\" She also blamed the media for the ensuing furor.[125][123]\n\nSubsequent activities\n\nIn September 2021, President Biden sent Conway a letter requesting that she resign from her position on the United States Air Force Academy's board of visitors, informing her that she'd otherwise be dismissed from it. Biden sent similar letters to eleven other political officials that Trump had appointed to military academy boards. Conway refused President Biden's request that she resign, and argued that her removal from the board broke norms, politicized the post, and would discourage others from serving on such boards in the future.[126][127][128] Conway, who had no prior connection to the Air Force, had been appointed to the board by Trump in the final weeks of his presidency.[129]\n\nIn 2022, Conway joined Fox News as a contributor.[130] She frequently appears as a guest/host on a variety of programs, including Hannity, The Five, Outnumbered, The Big Weekend Show, and more. Conway also contributed to Fox's 2022 Midterm Election coverage. In July 2024, Fox News announced that Conway will host a weekly program on the network's streaming platform, Fox Nation, called Here's The Deal with Kellyanne Conway.[131]\n\nIn April 2022, Conway joined the board of the America First Policy Institute.[132] In November 2022, Conway gave an on the record interview to the United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack.[133] On March 1, 2023, Conway spoke with prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorney's office as part of their criminal investigation into Trump[134]\n\nSince 2024, Conway has been paid by the Club for Growth to advocate on behalf of the social media app TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance.[135] In this capacity, Conway lobbied against efforts to restrict or force the sale of TikTok amid congressional consideration of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act.[136]\n\nIn December 2023, Conway met with congressional Republicans and argued that it was electorally necessary for them to support protections of access to birth control, citing public approval for such protection.[137] Shortly after the Supreme Court of Alabama delivered their February 2024 ruling in LePage v. Center for Reproductive Medicine, Conway's firm shared polls that they had conducted demonstrating broad public support for protections of IVF and fertility treatments, even among Americans opposed to abortion and self-identifying evangelicals.[138]\n\nConway delivered a speech during on the third night of the 2024 Republican National Convention.[139]\n\nPolitical views\n\nConway addressing the 2017 March for Life in Washington, D.C.\n\nConway views herself as a Generation X conservative.[140][141] Conway is anti-abortion, saying in 1996: \"We're pro-life. The fetus beat us. We grew up with sonograms. We know life when we see it.\"[141] She spoke at the 2017 March for Life, an annual rally protesting abortion and Roe v. Wade.[142]\n\nShe does not consider herself a feminist \"in a classical sense\", saying that she believes the term is associated with being \"anti-male\" and \"pro-abortion\", but identifies as what she calls an \"individual feminist\".[143] Conway has opined that many feminists fail to accept women who are pro-life and conservative, and that they \"'mainly care about what happens from the waist down... It's an insult. You know, it's [from] the waist up for me \u2013 my eyes, my ears, my head, my heart, my mouth certainly.'\"[28] She has also said that \"nobody cared\" about her experience with sexual harassment and her Me Too moment because of her political views.[144]\n\nPersonal life\n\nConway was married to George Conway,[145] who is of counsel at the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, and wrote the Supreme Court brief for Paula Jones during the Clinton impeachment in 1998.[146][147] The couple have four children: twins Claudia and George IV, Charlotte, and Vanessa.[147] Prior to Trump's presidency, they lived in Alpine, New Jersey.[35][148][149] Prior to her marriage, Conway dated senator Fred Thompson.[150]\n\nGeorge Conway is a critic of Trump; in December 2019 he co-founded the Lincoln Project, which campaigned against Donald Trump's re-election from a conservative perspective.[151] In March 2019, President Trump responded to criticism from Kellyanne's husband George by describing George as a \"stone cold LOSER & husband from hell\".[152] Kellyanne defended Trump by saying that George Conway is \"not a psychiatrist\" and that Trump should not be expected to respond when George, \"a non-medical professional accuses him of having a mental disorder\".[153]\n\nConway's daughter Claudia is a TikTok influencer who became known in 2020, at age 15, for her anti-Trump messages.[154][155][156][157] In July 2020 she said that her parents' marriage had \"failed\".[156] Claudia identifies as a leftist and liberal[158][159] and described her TikTok fan base as \"leftist, A.C.A.B. (All Cops Are Bastards), anti-trump, blm (Black Lives Matter)\".[160] In August 2020, Claudia Conway announced she was seeking emancipation.[161] In January 2021, she claimed that her mother has been \"physically, mentally, and emotionally abusive,\" posting videos on TikTok appearing to show her mother screaming at and even once hitting her.[162] On January 25, 2021, Kellyanne Conway's official Twitter account shared a topless photo of a girl later confirmed to be Claudia Conway.[163] New Jersey police launched an investigation into the matter.[164] At age 16, Claudia Conway appeared as a contestant on, but was eliminated from, American Idol.[165]\n\nIn September 2019, Conway's cousin Giovanna Coia, who was then White House press assistant, married Vice President Mike Pence's nephew John Pence, who worked for the Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign.[166][167][168]\n\nOne of the few White House staffers to have had protection from the Secret Service due to various threats, Conway chose \"Blueberry\" as her Secret Service code name because of associations with the fruit from her youth in pageants and berry picking.[169]\n\nIn a September 2018 interview with Jake Tapper on CNN, Conway stated she was the victim of a sexual assault.[170][171]\n\nOn August 23, 2020, Conway announced her resignation in order to \"spend more time with her family,\"[172] as did her husband George, who announced he had taken time off from the Lincoln Project and Twitter.[173]\n\nIn March 2023, George and Kellyanne announced that they were divorcing after 22 years of marriage.[174]\n\nAwards\n\nBooks\n\nIn 2005, Conway and Democratic pollster Celinda Lake co-authored What Women Really Want: How American Women Are Quietly Erasing Political, Racial, Class, and Religious Lines to Change the Way We Live (Free Press/Simon & Schuster, 2005; ISBN 0-7432-7382-6).\n\nIn 2022, Conway authored Here's the Deal: A Memoir (Threshold Editions, 2022; ISBN 1982187344).",

Reeher said the Democrats would need to replace President Biden very soon if they hope to regain ground.\n\n\u201cIn order to give the new candidate enough time to generate enthusiasm, and for the party\u2019s national campaign to adjust its strategy and messaging. The problem for the Democrats is, how do they avoid what appears to be a somewhat weak national candidacy by Kamala Harris without spilling a lot of internal party blood and creating deep internal divisions. They\u2019d have to step over a woman of color. Not a good look for the Democrats. There are some other prominent Democrats who might be more appealing in a national general election; I just don\u2019t see how the Democrats get to them without creating a lot of chaos and bitterness,\u201d said Reeher.\n\nHow can this current unrest in the Democratic Party impact congressional races?\n\n\u201cIf enthusiasm among Democrats drops, either through dissatisfaction with Biden and concerns over his health, or concerns about a Harris presidency, that could lead some potential voters to just sit it out,\u201d said Reeher. \u201cAnd on the other side, sensing a victory, it could energize the Republicans. So, while the issue at the top of the ticket won\u2019t change a lot of minds about who to choose in a congressional race, it could have impact on who is voting in the first place.\u201d\n\nSyracuse University Associate Professor of Communications Joshua Darr teaches about political communication in the Newhouse School. His comments below reference Biden\u2019s press conference after attending NATO meeting.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to see how tonight\u2019s press conference at the NATO meeting could reverse Biden\u2019s slide \u2013 his campaign clearly hopes it can, since they\u2019ve been promoting it relentlessly. Combined with the Republican National Convention next week, this might be the most critical 10 days in the entire campaign,\u201d said Darr.\n\n\u201cThe murmurs against Biden in the party are becoming a roar, just days after it seemed like Biden had his support secured. Nancy Pelosi\u2019s appearance on Morning Joe on Wednesday very clearly left the door open for Democrats to continue to voice their desire for Biden to step aside,\u201d said Darr.\n\nSyracuse University political science professor Shana Gadarian is the author of \u201cAnxious Politics: Democratic Citizenship in a Threatening World\u201d and \u201cPandemic Politics: The Deadly Toll of Partisanship in the Age of COVID.\u201d She studies political psychology and American politics.

        "text": "Can Biden be replaced as Democrats' nominee? Not so easily\nCan Biden be replaced as nominee? Not so easily\n\nGetty Images\n\nPressure is growing on Joe Biden to step aside after his poorly received performance in the first presidential debate against Donald Trump. With November's election bearing down, a growing number of senior Democrats are speaking publicly or privately about their concerns. The top two Democrats in the US Congress, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, have told him they fear he will be a drag on their members running for election. More than 20 other lawmakers have publicly broken ranks, as have prominent supporters and party donors. Mr Biden has in recent weeks defiantly vowed to stay in the race but now a Covid infection will sideline him for days. Let's run through the possible scenarios.\n\nCan Joe Biden withdraw?\n\nYes, if - and it's a big if - Mr Biden decides to step down as the Democratic Party's standard bearer, it would be relatively straightforward to find another candidate. The party's nominee will officially be chosen at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago from 19-22 August. The Democrats are reportedly planning to nominate Mr Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris virtually ahead of that gathering. There, a candidate must win support from the majority of \"delegates\" - party officials who formally choose the nominee. Delegates are assigned to candidates proportionally based on the results of each state's primary election. This year, Mr Biden won almost 99% of the nearly 4,000 delegates. According to DNC rules, those delegates are \"pledged\" to support the incumbent president.\n\nBiden 'not going anywhere' despite unclear moments in July 4 speech\n\nIf Mr Biden willingly drops out, it could turn into a free-for-all. Democrats would be left with an open convention where they would suggest potential nominees and continue voting until one receives the majority of delegate votes. That could spark a frantic contest among Democrats vying for a shot at the nomination. Mr Biden has so far given no indication that he would consider stepping aside. But if he decides to do so, \"that opens up an entirely different can of worms\", political historian Leah Wright Rigueur told BBC News. \"I think that if he were to get replaced, part of the negotiation for him stepping down would be that he would get the final say in who replaces him,\" she said.\n\nCould he be forced out?\n\nIf he doesn't want to go, this is where the process gets really tricky. In the modern political era, a major national party has never tried a hostile takeover of the nomination. However, DNC regulations do have some loopholes that could, in theory, make it possible to push Mr Biden out. The rules allow delegates to \"in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them\", meaning they could look to someone else. \"It could be an incredibly ugly scenario,\" Ms Wright Rigueur said. Experts told BBC News they doubt there would be a revolt among party delegates. But the DNC can alter party rules at any point. Ms Wright Rigueur pointed to 1968, when President Lyndon B Johnson decided not to run for re-election. The party shifted from an open convention process, in which delegates could cast ballots for whomever they chose, to a bound process, where a delegate was attached to a candidate based on primary results. Even if Mr Biden were suddenly to exit the race, conservative groups have vowed to file lawsuits challenging the legality of any replacement Democrat's eligibility for the ballot.\n\nMore on the election\n\nWill Kamala Harris replace Biden?\n\nVice-President Kamala Harris would automatically take Mr Biden's place if he were to step down during his presidential term. But the same rules do not apply if Mr Biden pulls out as a candidate for November's election race, and there is no mechanism in place that would give the vice-president an upper hand at an open convention. Instead, Ms Harris would have to win the majority of delegates, just like any other candidate. It may be that Mr Biden backs her to replace him if he steps aside. As she is already on the Democratic ticket, Ms Harris would have access to all the campaign funds currently available to the president. And she has a national profile. But her relatively low popularity among the American public might dull that advantage.\n\nCould the 25th Amendment be invoked?",

        "text": "Vance or Harris: Does a VP pick help win the US election?\nDecades of research shows that VP picks rarely swing the vote \u2013 in key states or among vital demographics.\n\nOn Monday, Donald Trump picked Ohio Senator JD Vance as his Republican running mate in the United States presidential election, following weeks of speculation over who the real estate mogul and ex-president would choose.\n\nOn the opposing ticket, meanwhile, is Kamala Harris, running with Democrat Joe Biden. Harris is the incumbent VP who ran with Biden in 2020, when the California senator became the first Black woman and the first Asian American to compete on a major party\u2019s presidential ticket.\n\nSince the Vance announcement, analysts have pored over possible reasons why Trump might have selected the former venture capitalist and author who until a few years ago was a trenchant critic of the ex-president.\n\nBut does the choice of VP actually boost a presidential candidate\u2019s chances of winning the election? Al Jazeera breaks down decades of election results, polls and analysis to find out.\n\nDo presidents perform better in the VP\u2019s home state?\n\nThat\u2019s often a central consideration that political insiders cite \u2013 the hope that the VP pick might help the ticket win his or her state.\n\nHowever, researchers who have studied election results over decades say there is little to suggest that this calculation actually helps.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very rare that we find that a running mate would deliver a particular home state,\u201d Kyle Kopko, an adjunct professor of political science at Elizabethtown College in Pennsylvania told Al Jazeera.\n\nKopko has extensively researched and written about the electoral effect of running mates with Christopher Devine, political science professor at the University of Dayton.\n\nDuring his research, Kopko has found that VPs can mobilise more votes for presidential candidates most frequently if they come from a small state and have a great deal of political experience. This does not apply to JD Vance.\n\nAn example of a running mate like this was Biden himself, when he was former President Barack Obama\u2019s VP in the 2008 and 2012 elections, Kopko said.\n\nBiden comes from Delaware, a small state with only three counties. He had \u201ca tremendous amount of political experience serving in the Senate from Delaware\u201d, said Kopko.\n\n\u201cBut Delaware was already a pretty consistent Democratic state in the Electoral College.\u201d\n\nHow have presidents historically fared in their VP\u2019s state?\n\nWhile presidential hopefuls typically do win in their running mates\u2019 home states, they have in recent decades almost always chosen VP picks from states they were anyway expected to win \u2014 and not from swing states.\n\nWhen they have chosen VP candidates from states in the balance, the results have been mixed \u2013 at best.\n\nConsider 1960, when Democrat John F Kennedy, won Texas, the home state of his running mate Lyndon B Johnson, with 50.5 percent votes.\n\nBoth Kennedy and Johnson said that if it weren\u2019t for Johnson, Kennedy would not have made gains in the South. Kopko said that this is where the myth of the VP\u2019s home-state advantage comes from.\n\nThe Democrats, who had traditionally dominated Texas politics, had lost in the state in 1952 and 1956 \u2013 and so could use a boost. However, Kopko\u2019s analysis of survey data from that election shows that Johnson was actually unpopular among the state\u2019s voters and might have hurt Kennedy in Texas. The race in the state was close \u2013 Kennedy defeated Richard Nixon by 2 percentage points.\n\nIn 1992 and 1996, Democrat Bill Clinton won in Tennessee, the state of his running mate Al Gore. It was the first time that Democrats had won Tennessee since 1964. But was Al Gore responsible? In 2000, when Gore was his party\u2019s presidential nominee, he lost in Tennessee to George W Bush.\n\nIf Gore\u2019s 2000 loss in Tennessee showed that presidential candidates aren\u2019t guaranteed wins in their state, that also holds true for VP nominees.\n\nIn the 1968 election, while Republican Richard Nixon won the presidency comfortably, Democrat challenger Hubert Humphrey won in Maryland, the home state of Nixon\u2019s VP Spiro Agnew.\n\nWhat about recent years?\n\nIn 2020, Biden won in California, Harris\u2019s state, with 63.5 percent of the votes. However, since 1992, a Democratic candidate has always won in California. Indiana Governor Mike Pence was Trump\u2019s VP and Trump won in the state with 57 percent of the votes. Since 1968, Republican candidates have won in Indiana in every election except 2008, when Democrat Obama won.\n\nIn 2016, Trump, who was running with Pence, won in Indiana with 57.2 percent of the votes. Hillary Clinton was running with Virginia Senator Tim Kaine for the Democratic Party. Clinton won Virginia with 50.2 percent of votes.\n\nIn 2012, Obama ran with Biden as his VP and swept Delaware with 58.6 percent of votes. Wisconsin representative Paul Ryan was Republican challenger Mitt Romney\u2019s running mate. Romney did not win in Wisconsin, where Obama grabbed 52.8 percent of the vote.\n\nIn 2008, Obama won in Delaware with 62 percent of the vote. Republican challenger, John McCain, picked former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin to run with him. McCain won in Alaska with 50 percent of the vote.\n\nWhat do past polls tell us?\n\nEven if presidential candidates perform marginally better in their running mate\u2019s home state, as some studies suggest, their overall national popularity seems largely unaffected.\n\nIn the last election, Biden announced Harris as his VP on August 11, 2020.\n\nBased on the voting analysis platform FiveThirtyEight\u2019s average of 2020 presidential election polls, Harris did not have a significant impact on Biden\u2019s popularity among voters.\n\nIn late February 2020, Biden and Trump were running close in polls, with Biden only 3.8 percentage points ahead of his Republican competitor. This gap tripled to 9.5 percentage points by late June 2020, before Harris was announced as Biden\u2019s VP.\n\nOn August 3, 2020, Biden was 8.2 percentage points ahead, at 50.5 percent against Trump\u2019s 42.3 percent. By August 24, Biden\u2019s poll performance only saw a meagre boost; he was at 51.4 percent on the polls.\n\nFor the 2016 election, Trump announced Mike Pence as his running mate on July 15, 2016, while Democratic competitor Clinton chose Kaine as her VP on July 22, 2016.\n\nThe competition between Trump and Hilary Clinton was close on June 9, 2016, with Clinton only 4 percentage points ahead, according to the FiveThirtyEight national poll average that year. The gap closed further to 3.5 by July 14, 2016.\n\nBy July 30, 2016, after both VP picks had been announced, Clinton and Trump were neck and neck, polling almost identically. However, the gap grew and August and September saw the biggest difference in percentage points between Clinton and Trump, peaking to 8.1 during this time.\n\nWhen Biden picked Harris as his running mate, analysts predicted it would boost support for Biden among Black voters.\n\nA poll conducted by Northwestern University\u2019s Center for the Study of Diversity and Democracy during the summer of 2020 found 57 percent of African Americans responded they would be more enthusiastic about voting for Biden if he chose an African American woman as his VP.\n\nAfter the election, a CBS exit poll showed 90 percent of Black female voters had supported Biden. However, Black women made up only 9 percent of the exit poll\u2019s sample comprising 15,285 respondents.\n\nKopko said his analysis found little evidence of VPs improving votes among specific voter groups.\n\nFor instance, he said, there was little statistical evidence proving that Geraldine Ferraro, the running mate of Democratic candidate Walter Mondale in 1984, or Sarah Palin, John McCain\u2019s 2008 VP pick, were able to mobilise women voters for their tickets, despite both being popular among female voters in opinion polls.\n\nIn fact, a Pew Research Center report breaking down the 2020 election results showed that Trump made inroads with women voters, gaining 44 percent of the vote share from women, compared with 2016 when it was 39 percent. This, in a year, when Harris was on the opposing ticket, and Trump had Pence as his running mate.\n\nIf presidential candidates aren\u2019t choosing running mates on their ability to turn swing states or because they can substantially attract demographics that wouldn\u2019t otherwise vote for them, what are the other factors at play?\n\nKopko said some presidents pick a VP who aligns with their politics to reinforce their policy agenda to voters. He said that while it is difficult to determine Trump\u2019s overall motivation behind picking Vance, he speculated Trump picked Vance because he would be easier to work with if Trump wins the election because their policy priorities overlap.\n\nThere could be another reason, too. In this third presidential race now, Trump has come up against a range of Republicans who have challenged him in 2016, 2020 or 2024, before \u2013 in most cases \u2013 falling in line and kissing the ring.\n\nVance, while a former critic of Trump\u2019s, has never contested against him electorally.\n\n\u201cJD Vance wasn\u2019t running for president. He wasn\u2019t attacking Trump along the campaign trail,\u201d Kopko said.",

In a survey held recently, about two-thirds of Democrats have said that the incumbent president should withdraw from the presidential election. It is against Biden's post-debate claim that 'average Democrats' are with him though some 'big names' are turning on him.In an opinion poll conducted recently, AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research has found about 65% of Democrats and 70% of Americans want Biden to step aside, reports 'New York Post'. According to this poll, half of Democrats (48%) have no confidence that Joe Biden has the mental capability to serve effectively as president. This is up from 32% in an AP-NORC poll in February.It came after Democrats were dissatisfied with Biden as their nominee had surged 16 percentage points in the last month. An opinion poll held during June 20-24 poll showed 39% expressing disease with the president at the top of the 2024 ticket and a July 11-15 poll revealed that number rising to 48%. The AP-NORC poll was conducted before Saturday\u2019s assassination attempt on Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.The survey also found nearly 30% of respondents saying Vice President Kamala Harris would make a good president, 17% supporting California Governor Gavin Newsom and 15% backing Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer.Rejecting calls to step aside and denying the reports that he has cognitive problems, Joe Biden told BET in an interview that he would reconsider his candidacy if a medical professional gave him an unfavorable evaluation. He said that if he had some medical condition that emerged, if somebody, if doctors came to him and said, you got this problem and that problem, he would rethink his decision to contest the presidential election.Meanwhile, amid this hullabaloo, 21 Democratic members of Congress, including most recently Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who is running for an open Senate seat in November, have asked the president to step aside.In an opinion poll conducted recently, AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research has found about 65% of Democrats and 70% of Americans want Biden to step aside.Rejecting calls to step aside and denying the reports that he has cognitive problems, Joe Biden told BET in an interview that he would reconsider his candidacy if a medical professional gave him an unfavorable evaluation.",

        "text": "How will photos of Trump shooting shape US presidential campaign?\nIt\u2019s a photo that appeared around the world. A bloodied Donald Trump, his fist raised, as Secret Service officers rush the former president from a stage.\n\nTaken by Associated Press journalist Evan Vucci, the image captures the immediate aftermath of the attempted assassination of Trump at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday.\n\nSome U.S. media outlets have described the images from that day as iconic. Some say they have the potential to alter the course of the presidential election; others have commented on the enduring legacy of still photography in the age of video.\n\nBut ethics experts are watching to see how \u2014 in a polarized time \u2014 media and others use the coverage of the attack.\n\nRon Burnett, former president of the Emily Carr University of Art and Design in Canada and an expert on images, said he believes photography can have a powerful impact.\n\n\u201cThe iconic effects of a photograph are not to be underestimated at all, actually, because truth does not stand up to icons. Icons actually always are of greater effect than truth, which is a really scary thought, but which is true,\u201d he told VOA.\n\nHe added that imagery of the attempted assassination reinforces the Trump campaign narrative.\n\n\"The photo fits very heavily with the kind of way in which he's approached every stage of this, let's call it, battle, because he sees it as a battle. The photo suggests, among many different things, that he's in a war and already in constant danger,\u201d said Burnett, who is based in Vancouver.\n\nSubramaniam Vincent, the director of Santa Clara University\u2019s journalism and media ethics center, said the portrayal of the moment will play into the political discourse.\n\n\u201cSo, the real ethics of it, I think, comes in, in interpreting where the picture is, what it stands for in the narrative about American culture, politics, guns, violence,\u201d he told VOA.\n\nWATCH: Media work to combat disinformation on Trump shooting\n\nFor Vucci, capturing the shooting and aftermath was a priority. \u201cI knew that this was a moment in American history that had to be documented,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, it's our job as journalists to do this work.\u201d\n\nAs the news media work to verify what happened at the rally, on social media, mis- and disinformation are flourishing.\n\nAmong conspiracy theories being shared are claims that falsely say political parties on either side are responsible. Journalists are working to set the record straight.\n\n\"There's no evidence for either of these conspiracy theories, but they reflect the kind of claims that are spreading in this very polarized emotional climate in the immediate aftermath of the assassination attempt,\u201d David Klepper, a reporter for the AP, was cited as saying.\n\nTwo days after the attack, Trump was back on stage, this time for the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nData from the cyber analysts PeakMetrics shows that in the hours after the attack, social media mentions of him are increasing, says the AP.\n\nWhile the majority of posts analyzed by the company expressed sympathy, PeakMetrics found others that sought to seed conspiracy theories or spread false or misleading claims.",

Top allies have either publicly or privately called on him to step aside. Major donations have fallen off a cliff. Grassroots fundraising is not keeping up with the demands of a campaign that needs to aggressively scale up three months before the presidential election. Members of his own re-election effort have already declared he has no path to victory.\n\nSince a disastrous debate in Atlanta upended the trajectory of his campaign three weeks ago, Biden has again and again attempted to dig in, bucking efforts to dislodge him from power.\n\nBut there is now a palpable sense that the ground has shifted underneath him, according to five people with knowledge of the situation, even among some of the president\u2019s most defiant internal backers who now believe the writing is on the wall.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re close to the end,\u201d a person close to Biden said.\n\nThat person, who previously doubted Biden would ever step aside, acknowledged that it\u2019s still the president\u2019s decision but joined in the array of Biden allies who say he is nearing a point of no return.\n\nAs the extraordinary events have unfolded, the president tested positive with Covid on Wednesday and retreated to his vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, taking him off the campaign trail. Once again, it offered a sharp contrast with former President Donald Trump, who, even after his brush with death on Saturday, will appear at a raucous coronation at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee on Thursday night.\n\nAlso Wednesday, Rep. Adam Schiff, who is running for the Senate in California, made a remarkable public call for the president to abandon the nomination, a move that ended up exposing that other Democratic leaders \u2014 including Reps. Hakeem Jeffries and Nancy Pelosi, and Sen. Chuck Schumer \u2014 had brought dire concerns, supported by polling, to the president indicating that he risked taking down control of Congress with him if he stayed on the same path.\n\nIn the hours after the assassination attempt on Trump last weekend, some Democrats said \u2014 even feared \u2014 that the calls for Biden to step aside would be \u201cfrozen\u201d as the president dealt with a national crisis. But that faded quickly. Some allies now say that the shooting, which has caused an even more intense rallying around Trump within his party, only makes it more glaringly obvious that the nagging narrative of whether Biden is on a cognitive decline cannot win the White House.\n\nA person with knowledge of the projections said the Biden campaign now expects it will raise only 25% of the big donor money it had originally projected to raise in July \u2014 that\u2019s a further downgrade from the expectation last week that large-dollar fundraising would be down by as much as 50%. The money has \u201cdried up,\u201d this person said.\n\nOne Democratic lawmaker on Wednesday said if Biden didn\u2019t agree to step aside, the cacophony of calls will grow only louder, with more lawmakers expected to urge him to do so. The lawmaker called it a \u201csad moment\u201d for the party.\n\nA sense of reality is beginning to wash over some of the president\u2019s top campaign lieutenants, who have endured streams of phone calls from donors and one-time supporters flagging that they can no longer back Biden.\n\nA person who spoke with a senior campaign official said a sense of a new reality has fallen over the campaign.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re finally realizing: It\u2019s a when, not if,\u201d the person said.\n\nThere has been a shift behind the scenes in the president\u2019s openness to stepping aside, according to multiple people close to Biden, despite his aggressive insistence in public appearances and private phone calls with allies that he is not going anywhere.\n\nBiden had already, in the opinion of some aides, shown signs that if he were convinced there was no path \u201che would not go forward with this,\u201d a person with knowledge of the president\u2019s conversations with aides said.\n\nNBC News previously reported that Biden\u2019s private conversations with aides had grown more \u201creality-based\u201d and included talk of how his legacy could be defined by his having a prolonged stalemate with his own party or by losing the White House to Donald Trump, who Biden has repeatedly warned is a danger to American democracy.\n\nOutwardly, campaign officials remain steadfast in their assertion that Biden isn\u2019t going anywhere.\n\n\u201cThe president is feeling fine. He is self-isolating in Delaware,\u201d Quentin Fulks, principal deputy campaign manager for the Biden campaign, said at a news conference in Milwaukee. \u201cOur campaign is not working through any scenarios where President Biden is not the top of the ticket. He is and will be the Democratic nominee.\u201d\n\nSince a televised debate on June 27 at which Biden appeared confused, at times unable to complete a sentence, his every move has been scrutinized. Biden accelerated his usually severely limited media exposure to demonstrate he can make a cogent argument for re-election.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m old,\u201d Biden told NBC News\u2019 Lester Holt in an interview on Monday. \u201cBut I\u2019m only three years older than Trump, No. 1. And No. 2, my mental acuity\u2019s been pretty damn good. I\u2019ve gotten more done than any president has in a long, long time in 3\u00bd years. So I\u2019m willing to be judged on that.\u201d\n\nBut rather than allay concerns, Biden\u2019s exposure only intensified them among allies. Biden has stumbled, mixing up names and seeming to lose his train of thought.\n\nBefore coming off the trail on Wednesday, for instance, Biden mistakenly called Nevada\u2019s Democratic state attorney general the state\u2019s governor, who is a Republican, according to a pool report of the exchange.\n\n\u201cSad,\u201d is how one close Biden ally described the dynamic around the president.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no excitement in this campaign at all,\u201d another ally said.\n\nSome Biden aides have cautioned that the campaign has picked up on some voter anger in battleground states over the feeling that people are trying to chase the president they voted for off the ballot.\n\nAnd even as calls for Biden to step aside grow louder, a campaign official said that, as of this past weekend, no one had yet presented a detailed plan for an alternative to Biden.\n\nIn an interview that aired Wednesday evening, Biden said that, in addition to being shown that there was no path to victory, there was something else that would prompt him to re-evaluate his campaign.\n\n\u201cIf I have some medical condition that emerged,\u201d Biden suggested. \u201cIf somebody, if the doctors came to me and said you got this problem, that problem.\u201d\n\nCarol E. Lee and Monica Alba reported from Washington; Natasha Korecki reported from Chicago.",

        "text": "Obama, Pelosi, other top Democrats make a fresh push for Biden to reconsider 2024 race\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Democrats at the highest levels are making a critical push for President Joe Biden to rethink his election bid, with former President Barack Obama expressing concerns to allies and Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi privately telling Biden the party could lose the ability to seize control of the House if he doesn\u2019t step away from the 2024 race.\n\nREAD MORE: What would make Biden drop out of the race? Here are the four reasons he\u2019s cited\n\nBiden\u2019s orbit, already small before his debate fumbling, has grown even smaller in recent days. Isolated as he battles a COVID infection at home in Delaware, the president is relying on a few longtime aides as he weighs whether to bow to the mounting pressure to drop out.\n\nThe Biden For President campaign is calling an all-staff meeting for Friday. It\u2019s heading into a critical weekend for the party as Republican Donald Trump wraps up a heady Republican National Convention in Milwaukee and Democrats, racing time, consider the extraordinary possibility of Biden stepping aside for a new presidential nominee before their own convention next month in Chicago.\n\nAs anxiety and information swirled, Biden\u2019s closest friend in Congress and his campaign co-chair, Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, told The Associated Press: \u201cPresident Biden deserves the respect to have important family conversations with members of the caucus and colleagues in the House and Senate and Democratic leadership. and not be battling leaks and press statements.\u201d\n\nLate Thursday, Montana Sen. Jon Tester became the second Democrat in the chamber Biden served in for four decades to call on him to step aside, saying in a statement, \u201cI believe President Biden should not seek reelection to another term.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: As some push Biden to quit the race, Democrats aim to nominate president in first week of August\n\nSome Cabinet members are resigned to the likelihood of Biden losing in November. They have concerns about the insularity of his team and are focusing on having policies finalized and in place ahead of the end of his term, according to a person familiar with their thinking. The person insisted on anonymity to discuss private conversations.\n\nCampaign officials said Biden was even more committed to staying in the race even as the calls for him to go mounted. But there was also time to reconsider. He has been told the campaign is having trouble raising money, and some Democrats see an opportunity as he is away from the campaign for a few days to encourage his exit.\n\nBiden, 81, tested positive for COVID-19 while traveling in Las Vegas and is experiencing \u201cmild symptoms\u201d including \u201cgeneral malaise\u201d from the infection, the White House said.\n\nThe president himself, in a radio interview taped just before he tested positive, dismissed the idea it was too late for him to recover politically, telling Univision\u2019s Luis Sandoval that many people don\u2019t focus on the November election until September.\n\n\u201cAll the talk about who\u2019s leading and where and how, is kind of, you know \u2014 everything so far between Trump and me has been basically even,\u201d he said in an excerpt of the interview released Thursday.\n\nBut in Congress, Democratic lawmakers have begun having private conversations about lining up behind Vice President Kamala Harris as an alternative. One lawmaker said Biden\u2019s own advisers are unable to reach a unanimous recommendation about what he should do. More in Congress are considering joining the nearly two dozen who have called for Biden to drop out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear the issue won\u2019t go away,\u201d said Vermont Sen. Peter Welch, the other Senate Democrat who has publicly said Biden should exit the race. Welch said the current state of party angst \u2013 with lawmakers panicking and donors revolting \u2013 was \u201cnot sustainable.\u201d\n\nObama has conveyed to allies that Biden needs to consider the viability of his campaign but has also made clear that the decision is one Biden needs to make. The former president has taken calls in recent days from members of congressional leadership, Democratic governors and key donors to discuss their concerns about his former vice president.\n\nPelosi also presented polling to Biden that she argued shows he likely can\u2019t defeat Republican Trump \u2014 though the former speaker countered Thursday in a sharp statement that the \u201cfeeding frenzy\u201d from anonymous sources \u201cmisrepresents any conversations\u201d she may have had with the president.\n\nThis story is based in part on reporting from more than half a dozen people who insisted on anonymity to discuss sensitive private deliberations. The Washington Post first reported on Obama\u2019s involvement.\n\nBiden said Monday he hadn\u2019t spoken to Obama in a couple of weeks.\n\nREAD MORE: New AP-NORC poll finds nearly two-thirds of Democrats want Biden to withdraw\n\nPressed about reports that Biden might be softening to the idea of leaving the race, his deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks said Thursday: \u201cHe is not wavering on anything.\u201d\n\nHowever, influential Democrats atop the party apparatus, including congressional leadership headed by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, are sending signals of strong concern.\n\nUsing mountains of data showing Biden\u2019s standing could seriously damage the ranks of Democrats in Congress, frank conversations in public and private and now the president\u2019s own few days of isolation, many Democrats see an opportunity to encourage a reassessment.\n\nOver the past week, Schumer and Jeffries, both of New York, have spoken privately to the president, candidly laying out the concerns of Democrats on Capitol Hill. Control of the House and Senate is at stake, and leaders are keenly aware that a Republican sweep in November could launch Trump\u2019s agenda for years to come.\n\nSeparately, the chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Rep. Suzan DelBene of Washington, spoke with the president last week armed with fresh data. The campaign chief specifically aired the concerns of front-line Democrats seeking election to the House.\n\nMajor political donors, particularly in Pelosi\u2019s California, have been putting heavy pressure on the president\u2019s campaign and members of Congress, according to one Democratic strategist. Schumer has told donors and others to bring their concerns directly to the White House.\n\nProminent California Rep. Adam Schiff, a close ally of Pelosi, called for Biden to drop his reelection bid, saying Wednesday he believes it\u2019s time to \u201cpass the torch.\u201d And Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland used a baseball metaphor to suggest in a recent letter to Biden, \u201cThere is no shame in taking a well-deserved bow to the overflowing appreciation of the crowd.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, many want Biden to stay in the race. And the Democratic National Committee is pushing ahead with plans for a virtual vote to formally make Biden its nominee in the first week of August, ahead of the Democratic National Convention, which begins Aug. 19.\n\nRep. James Clyburn, a senior Democrat who has been a key Biden ally, wrapped up several days of campaigning for Biden in Nevada and said: \u201cJoe Biden has the knowledge. He\u2019s demonstrated that time and time again.\u201d He warned against those who he said \u201chave an agenda.\u201d\n\nBut among Democrats nationwide, nearly two-thirds say Biden should step aside and let his party nominate a different candidate, according to an AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll. That sharply undercuts Biden\u2019s post-debate claim that \u201caverage Democrats\u201d are still with him even if some \u201cbig names\u201d are turning on him.\n\nThe Biden campaign pointed to what it called \u201cextensive support\u201d for his reelection from members of Congress in key swing states, as well as from the Congressional Black and Hispanic caucuses.\n\nOther Democrats in Congress have shown less support, including when Biden\u2019s top aides visited Democratic senators last week in a private lunch. When Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania asked for a show of hands on who was with the president, only his own and a few others including top Biden ally Coons of Delaware went up, according to one of the people granted anonymity to discuss the matter.\n\nAssociated Press writers Joey Cappelletti in Lansing, Mich., and Josh Boak.

        "text": "Trump's national lead over Biden grows \u2014 CBS News poll\nWhen former President Donald Trump accepts the Republican nomination Thursday night, he'll do so with his largest national lead over President Biden in the campaign thus far.\n\nA slight majority, including some who aren't voting for him, say Trump's words in the days since the assassination attempt have been more unifying than divisive. Voters feel the same way about Mr. Biden's response to the tragic events, too.\n\nBut it is Trump with the growing advantage in the vote. Trump is up five points nationally now, and three across the key battleground states. To put that national lead in context: it's been 20 years since a Republican presidential candidate has won the national popular vote, and over 30 years since a Republican won by more than five.\n\nThe race across the battlegrounds moved one point more toward Trump today since we surveyed the battlegrounds last week.\n\nFor voters, Trump's perceived handling of the assassination attempt is a net-positive reason to consider voting for him, but that effect is limited overall; for two-thirds, it has not changed their consideration calculus either way.\n\nOf the candidates atop the party tickets, Trump is the one more voters feel fights \"a lot\" for people like them.\n\nAmid the nomination debate on the Democratic side, Trump also leads Vice President Kamala Harris in a hypothetical matchup. There are at best marginal differences in how she and Mr. Biden currently run among demographic groups, such as younger voters and voters of color.\n\nA still substantial part of his party feels Mr. Biden should step aside as nominee, and Democrats continue to lag behind Republicans on their expressed likelihood of turning out this year.\n\nThere is a bipartisan view \u2014 though particularly among Republicans \u2014 that the U.S. Secret Service could have done more to prevent the shooting on Saturday.\n\nMr. Biden also responded to the events, and most Americans also think he's encouraged unity, including a third of Trump voters.\n\nFor all that, eight in 10 voters feel that civility in U.S. politics has gotten worse in recent years, and most expect an increase in political violence in the future.\n\nJD Vance\n\nThe addition of Sen. JD Vance to the GOP ticket is being viewed positively by Republican voters: most are at least satisfied, and half are enthusiastic about the choice. This is particularly true among the MAGA wing of the party.\n\nThis CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a representative sample of 2,247 registered voters nationwide interviewed between July 16-18, 2024. The sample was weighted by gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as past vote. Respondents were selected to be representative of registered voters nationwide. The margin of error for registered voters is \u00b12.7 points. Battlegrounds are AZ GA MI NC NV PA WI.\n\nToplines:\n\n",

        "text": "The Climate and 2024 Elections: What You Need To Know\nThe two major party candidates in the 2024 presidential election hold vastly different views on climate change and what should be done about it.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has authorized unprecedented federal funds and enacted a flurry of rules to fight climate change. Vice President Kamala Harris, the new Democratic nominee, is committed to climate change as a key issue and hopes to continue Biden\u2019s momentum on the issue. Meanwhile, if elected, former President Donald Trump aims to undo as much of it as he can. Trump has promised to get rid of what he sees as wasteful spending and burdensome regulations.\n\nFor many American voters, climate is a key issue that brings them out to the polls. When it comes to climate and 2024 elections much could depend on the turnout of these voters. What will they be considering? In this blog, we share a rundown of the current state of the climate crisis, as well as recent major climate actions in the United States. Finally, we share how this topic might affect November\u2019s presidential election.\n\nThe Current Climate Crisis\n\nThe Earth is facing a climate crisis that not only threatens its future but is causing impacts right now.\n\nGlobal warming is caused by greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide that trap the sun\u2019s heat close to the Earth\u2019s surface and warm it. This is a natural process, but the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has increased dramatically in the past century. Increased greenhouse gases within our atmosphere have caused long-term global warming.\n\nScientific consensus is that human activity is the main cause of this accelerated warming. We burn fossil fuels, like coal and gasoline, which increases the amount of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Plants can remove carbon dioxide from the air, but deforestation has reduced the number of trees.\n\nImpacts of Climate Change\n\nThe effects of climate change include more than warmer temperatures. Scientists have noted an increase in extreme weather events, like severe storms, droughts, flooding, wildfires, and heat waves, that is likely to continue. Small but significant changes in air temperature, sea and ocean temperatures, and other changes in weather patterns have contributed to this trend.\n\nChanges in climate also threaten agriculture and food production. Some regions will no longer be able to grow certain crops, and invasive or nuisance species may thrive in areas that once couldn\u2019t sustain them.\n\nFinally, the planet\u2019s oceans are not only warming, they are absorbing excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This process acidifies the water and endangers marine life. Further, melting ice sheets and glaciers are endangering Arctic ecosystems. They are also causing global sea levels to rise, which will impact coastal communities and infrastructure.\n\nThe Paris Agreement\n\nIt is possible to avoid the worst of these impacts with swift action. In 2015, representatives from nearly every country in the world met in Paris to negotiate a climate change treaty. The resulting \u201cParis Agreement\u201d aims to limit global temperature rise to 2\u00b0 C/3.6\u00b0 F above pre-industrial levels. Its ideal goal is to keep global warming under 1.5\u00b0 C/2.7\u00b0 F, a \u201ctipping point\u201d that scientists say would cause irreversible impacts. Countries around the world must dramatically lower emissions by 2030 to reach either benchmark.\n\nRecent Actions on Climate Change\n\nThe Biden administration has taken many legislative and executive actions to tackle climate change in the past four years. President Biden rejoined the Paris Agreement in 2021 after former President Donald Trump withdrew in 2017.\n\nThe Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, passed in 2021, was the first major climate legislation passed during the Biden administration. A bipartisan deal, it included $105 billion for public transit, along with funding for electric vehicles, charging stations, cyclist and pedestrian infrastructure, and renewable energy.\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act, passed in 2022, is the largest single piece of U.S. legislation addressing climate change to date. It included about $370 billion in projected spending on climate change and energy security. Experts estimate that the Inflation Reduction Act will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 43-48% from 2005 levels by 2035. While a significant, this reduction doesn\u2019t meet America\u2019s Paris Agreement pledge of a 50-52% reduction by 2030.\n\nPresident Biden also has finalized a large collection of new environmental rules and regulations, led by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). One of the most impactful rules will require coal plants and new natural gas power plants to cut or capture 90% of their greenhouse gas emissions by 2032.\n\nIn spite of these actions, President Biden hasn\u2019t been as firm on fossil fuel reduction as some climate activists want. In 2023, in exchange for a debt ceiling deal, he approved the Mountain Valley Pipeline in Virginia, a project that advocacy groups have criticized for its environmental impact.\n\nNotable State Actions\n\nIndividual states are busy taking action on climate change as well. Most have used federal climate funding to create climate action plans submitted to the EPA. This funding allows states to access grants for emissions reduction, clean energy, and other climate projects outlined in their plans.\n\nCalifornia set groundbreaking vehicle emissions standards with its Advanced Clean Cars II Act, which requires all vehicle sales to be zero-emissions by 2035. A total of 13 states have adopted these standards, but some made changes. Colorado, New Mexico, and Delaware set a different goal of 82% zero-emission car sales by 2032.\n\nIn May of 2024, Vermont became the first state to pass a Climate Superfund Bill. The new law requires fossil fuel companies to pay a share of costs associated with climate change. New York followed quickly with its own Climate Change Superfund Act in June. Lawmakers in California, Maryland, and Massachusetts have introduced similar bills.\n\nWill Climate Change Be a Key Issue in the 2024 Elections?\n\nWhen it comes to climate and 2024 elections, voters may not weigh this issue as high as others. Most Americans are concerned about climate change, yet they tend to prioritize other issues like the economy or immigration. Those who feel strongest about climate change tend to support government action to address it. This means turnout among pro-climate voters could be key.\n\nMost Americans view climate change as a major threat, but only 37% say it should be a \u201ctop priority\u201d for the President and Congress. These views differ significantly based on party affiliation. Democrats are far more likely to be concerned about climate change and support climate action than Republicans.\n\nThe environment is unlikely to be a top issue of the 2024 presidential election, overshadowed by others seen as more urgent or immediately relevant to voters. It could tip the scales in a close race, though. It also could motivate pro-climate-action voters. A recent poll found virtually no respondents who said climate change was very important to them and would also oppose action. If those who care the most about climate turn out to vote, they are more likely to favor Democratic incumbent President Biden and his plans for the environment.\n\nBut even if the climate does not change the course of the presidential election, its outcome may have a large impact on the climate.\n\nFormer President Trump has called climate change a \u201choax\u201d and tends to dismiss the issue. If re-elected, he promises to expand fossil fuel production, remove Biden\u2019s environmental regulations, and pull out of the Paris Agreement once again. He also hopes to reduce energy prices and support domestic energy sources, including both fossil fuels and low-emission nuclear power. The fossil fuel industry is still a large part of the U.S. economy. Voters who rely on it for employment will be concerned about any proposals that could threaten their jobs.\n\nGet Started With Plural\n\nAs Election Day nears, climate and other key policy issues will be the subject of debate and consideration among many voters.

        "text": "Second Trump term could bring more pressure on higher ed\nFor America\u2019s colleges and universities and the students they serve, the four years of Donald Trump\u2019s first term as president were fraught, defined by threats to international students, allegations of \u201cradical left indoctrination,\u201d free speech controversies and far-reaching attacks on fundamental institutional values such as diversity.\n\nSince Trump left office in 2021, universities have continued to grapple with the legacy of his term and the movement it spawned. His four years in office helped to pave the way for the Supreme Court\u2019s decision last summer banning race-conscious admissions. A controversial executive order spurred a cascade of state laws banning diversity, equity and inclusion programs and policies. Meanwhile, the rise of MAGA Republicanism spawned supercharged culture wars, entangling campuses and prompting some state officials to get increasingly involved in how public universities are run and what\u2019s taught in classrooms.\n\nNow, Trump is back and seeking another four years in the White House, and higher education could be in for greater scrutiny and heightened pressure if he wins. Higher education wasn\u2019t high on Trump\u2019s priority list the first time around, but an increasing anti\u2013higher education sentiment among Republicans and sectors of the public has shifted the political winds. That could open the door to more radical policy options.\n\nMost Popular Stories Most Popular\n\nTrump has already vowed to \u201cfire\u201d accreditors and reclaim colleges from the \u201cradical left,\u201d called for the creation of a free national online university paid for by taxes on wealthy colleges, threatened to deport campus protesters and backed extending green cards to college graduates. The Republican Party\u2019s 2024 platform, which Trump\u2019s team helped to write, calls for closing the Education Department and creating more affordable higher education options, along with deporting \u201cpro-Hamas radicals and [making] our college campuses safe and patriotic again.\u201d\n\nIn a second term, Trump would also have a sharp critic of higher education as his No. 2. His pick for vice president, Ohio senator J.D. Vance, has been an unsparing critic of universities, which he\u2019s characterized as being dedicated to \u201cdeceit and lies, not to the truth\u201d and controlled by \u201cleft-wing foundations.\u201d\n\nBrendan Cantwell, a professor of education at Michigan State University, sees a systematic approach in Trump\u2019s agenda and other conservative plans for higher education. They want to make \u201cdeep, structural changes,\u201d he said, and \u201cconvert the rhetoric about higher education that we\u2019ve seen on the political right into policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see the possibility of one or more of these levers being used to fundamentally remake the higher education sector as we know it,\u201d Cantwell said. \u201cFederal policy is what facilitated the creation of the higher education sector that we know today, and it\u2019s the federal government that can undo it.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s potential return to the White House comes at a time when colleges and universities are grappling with numerous challenges, from declining enrollment and shrinking budgets to campus tensions and a drop in public confidence. A potential second Trump term would likely exacerbate those challenges, according to interviews with a dozen liberal and conservative policy experts as well as college professors and leaders.\n\nWhy? Because the decrease in public trust over the last decade has made institutions more vulnerable. On top of that, President Biden\u2019s efforts to forgive billions in federal student loans have infuriated Republicans, spurring lawmakers in Congress and the states to get more involved in higher ed policy. The campus protests in the aftermath of Hamas\u2019s Oct. 7 attack on Israel and the ensuing war in Gaza added fuel to the fire, triggering congressional investigations and combative hearings with college leaders.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a good chance that higher ed could be front and center because it has made itself a target of populist frustration,\u201d said Frederick Hess, director of education policy studies for the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.\n\nExperts generally expect that rolling back policies put in place by the Biden administration and overhauling accreditation to allow alternative providers of college credentials to access federal financial aid would be among the first priorities for the Trump administration.\n\nOn the chopping block would likely be new Title IX protections for LGBTQ+ students, along with Biden\u2019s new income-driven repayment program that lowered monthly payments for millions of borrowers. A second Trump administration could also seek to scrutinize foreign funds that flow to colleges.\n\nThe agenda for a potential second term is in some ways similar to the first. The Betsy DeVos\u2013led Education Department rolled back Obama-era policies that would have held for-profits accountable, stepped up enforcement of a federal law that requires colleges and universities to report foreign gifts and contracts, and rewrote the Title IX regulations, leaving a controversial legacy that hasn\u2019t stood the test of time. Few of those changes have survived the Biden administration.\n\nDeVos also criticized colleges and faculty members for telling students \u201cwhat to think,\u201d a claim higher education leaders have pushed back on. \u201cThey say that if you voted for Donald Trump, you\u2019re a threat to the university community,\u201d she said in a February 2017 speech. \u201cBut the real threat is silencing the First Amendment rights of people with whom you disagree.\"\n\nTrump himself derided \u201cradical left indoctrination\u201d at elite institutions. He also threatened to review the tax-exempt status of nonprofit colleges and universities and to cut off federal funding to the University of California, Berkeley, for allegedly restricting the speech of conservative speakers. His Education Department discouraged the use of race in college admissions decisions and investigated Princeton University in fall 2020 after its president acknowledged that institutional racism exists on the campus.\n\nThen president Donald Trump signed an executive order to require colleges to support free speech in March 2019. Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nBut the first Trump administration was considered disorganized and chaotic. The Education Department struggled to run loan forgiveness programs such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness. Under that program, created in 2007, borrowers who work in public service jobs such as teaching can get their loans discharged after making payments for 10 years. Borrowers first became eligible for relief in September 2017\u2014nearly a year into Trump\u2019s first term\u2014but few individuals received forgiveness.\n\nThis time around, the Trump team will be more prepared to govern. To assist in that effort, the conservative Heritage Foundation has spearheaded an effort known as Project 2025 to recruit and train employees to serve in the administration and provide a blueprint to radically reshape the federal government, higher education policy included. Trump has recently tried to distance himself from Project 2025, although several of its proposals\u2014abolishing the Education Department, for one, and rescinding Biden\u2019s Title IX rule\u2014overlap with his own agenda and the party\u2019s platform. Further, several former officials who worked in the DeVos-led department helped write the Education Department section of Project 2025.\n\n\u201cThe incoming Trump administration will be more radical in what they want to do and hit the ground more quickly in what levers they want to pull,\u201d said Amy Laitinen, senior director for higher education at New America, a left-leaning think tank. \u201cThat\u2019s a bad combination.\u201d\n\nShifting Political Winds\n\nBefore Trump took office, 57 percent of Americans had either a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in higher education, according to Gallup. Now, only about 36 percent of Americans express confidence, and the drop is starker among Republicans. A June Gallup survey found that 20 percent of Republicans are confident in higher education\u2014a 36-point drop since 2015.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen the public view higher education this negatively in my lifetime,\u201d said Andrew Gillen, a research fellow at the conservative Cato Institute\u2019s Center for Educational Freedom. \u201cI think you could get a lot more support for something that the universities would have been able to brush off in the past. I think they are going to have a much harder time now.\u201d\n\nPolicy ideas on the table range from the likely\u2014rewriting or reversing the Biden administration\u2019s regulations\u2014to the more radical and far-fetched, like getting rid of the Education Department. More threats to tax institutions and strip their federal funding are expected.\n\n\u201cWhat should worry the higher ed community and the progressives is that the extent that Biden gets away with rewriting so many of the rules and laws around federal student aid is that you have created a landscape where I think it\u2019s possible that a Trump administration would no longer feel particularly constrained by the letter of the law,\u201d Hess said.\n\nRepublicans have already proposed bills to charge wealthy colleges for unpaid student loans and use that money for students in short-term workforce training programs. Lawmakers will likely redouble their efforts to restrict institutions\u2019 diversity, equity and inclusion policies and penalize those that they find to be insufficiently protecting Jewish students.\n\nJason Delisle, a nonresident senior policy fellow at the Urban Institute\u2019s Center on Education Data and Policy, said it all represents a sea change for Republicans. They used to take a hands-off approach to higher education and view a college degree as a pathway to good jobs and a way to grow the economy, he said, which justified the necessary federal investment. Now, \u201cthat calculus is gone from the thinking of most Republicans.\u201d\n\nThe new thinking is reflected in a sweeping plan to overhaul higher education introduced earlier this year that would put colleges on the hook for unpaid student loans, use graduates\u2019 earnings to evaluate programs and link some funding for institutions to their student outcomes, among other proposals aimed at lowering the cost of college and holding institutions accountable. The legislation, known as the College Cost Reduction Act, has 145 co-sponsors.\n\n\u201cThe most interesting thing is the change among folks on the right, and I think I count the Trump people in this, for their skepticism of higher education\u2014the skepticism of the value of it, their skepticism of culture war\u2014in a way that did not exist in 2016,\u201d said Delisle.\n\nIf Republicans control the House or Senate\u2014or both\u2014they will likely continue to investigate campus antisemitism and hold hearings to question college presidents while branching out to other hot-button issues as well. Some higher education groups and advocacy organizations have argued that the hearings and investigations, which have included requests for troves of internal documents and communications from the targeted universities, have echoes of the McCarthy era and threaten academic freedom and institutional autonomy.\n\n\u201cIf they were smart, they would double down on the culture war stuff. It works for them,\u201d said Laitinen. \u201cBut they don\u2019t need to do the policy. They can get the same wind [in their sails] from press conferences and hearings \u2026 The bully pulpit is enough for what they want to do.\u201d\n\nWhat Trump can accomplish on policy will depend in part, of course, on whom he picks to run the Education Department, if it survives. If the agency is staffed with populists and Trump loyalists, some observers predict a greater focus on culture war issues designed to rile up voters rather than substantive policy.\n\nThat group, Hess at AEI said, would be \u201cmore hard-charging and much less concerned about ruffling feathers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are people who thrive on the attack, but \u2026 the populist wing is not people who spent a lot of time worrying about the particulars of 400 Maryland Avenue,\u201d Hess said, referring to the address of the Education Department. \u201cThey aren\u2019t policy wonks. So part of the challenge is can they find policy wonks to help them figure out how to translate what they want to do into change.\u201d\n\nThe scrutiny on higher education and culture wars could elevate the profile of the education secretary. The gig has not typically gone to ambitious politicians. But it could now be more attractive for someone interested in launching a bid for Senate or the White House in 2028, or at least to someone with a background in\u2014and an agenda for\u2014higher education policy.\n\n\u201cCertainly, education looms large enough, given the degree to which our ideological clashes are cultural. It could be a real opportunity for somebody who wants to set themselves up,\u201d Hess said.\n\nCan Institutions Fight Back?\n\nThe potential second Trump administration comes as university leaders, who pushed back on Trump\u2019s policies and rhetoric in the first term, are bruised and battered. Already, some have signaled that they\u2019re less willing to engage in political fights going forward. Harvard University, for example, said in May that it will no longer make statements on political issues. But the stakes for colleges and universities couldn\u2019t be higher, and some leaders are already calling for stiffened spines in anticipation of what may be coming.\n\nUnderpinning the potentially sweeping policy changes is an anti-intellectual agenda that\u2019s an \u201cassault on the mission of higher education\u201d and promises to usher in \u201ca much more dangerous period\u201d than the first term, said Patricia McGuire, president of Trinity Washington University and an outspoken critic of the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cEverything else is details that we will learn to live with,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope that my colleagues as presidents don\u2019t get distracted by the bureaucratic agenda, because bureaucracies are all always with us. It doesn\u2019t matter what the name of the bureaucracy is.\u201d\n\nWhile \u201chigher education is the counterweight to government,\u201d McGuire said, the academy can\u2019t serve in that role without academic and intellectual freedom, which some officials are aiming to restrict. \u201cIf we don\u2019t preserve academic freedom, that\u2019s the ball game,\u201d she said.\n\nMcGuire and others say that at a time when traditional higher education is threatened, they are worried that university leaders will stand on the sidelines rather than fighting back. They point out that when Florida governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican who briefly ran for president, made a number of reforms to the state\u2019s colleges and universities and orchestrated a conservative takeover of the New College of Florida, no presidents in Florida spoke out.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re caving in on our values without any fight,\u201d McGuire said. \u201cThis is what bothers me more than anything else, and it tells me that we\u2019re not ready for a second Trump term. Because it\u2019s going to come fast and furious, and most of higher ed is going to lay down and hope it goes away. And it\u2019s not going to go away.\u201d\n\nKeith Curry, president of Compton College, a community college, said he learned from the first term the importance of staying focused on his college\u2019s mission to support students while standing up for them. No matter what happens in November, he said he\u2019ll keep doing just that. \u201cWe have to be unapologetic, regardless of who is the president of the United States,\u201d he said.\n\nCurry acknowledged that not all college leaders are in a position to speak out, and that doing so is more difficult after Trump\u2019s first term and the intensifying criticisms from state and federal lawmakers in the years since. Curry said some leaders are nervous and concerned, but \u201cwe gotta be thinking about what\u2019s best for our students and how we stand up for our students. For some leaders, standing up for them and being unapologetic, some of us could actually lose our jobs.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s first term amped up the age-old criticisms of \u201cliberal\u201d universities, putting them in the middle of contentious debates over what students are taught. The prime example was an executive order banning the promotion of so-called divisive concepts in federally funded programs, which disrupted campus diversity programs. State leaders responded with bans on what they called critical race theory and diversity, equity and inclusion programs. So far, 14 states have passed laws restricting DEI policies and offices on college campuses\u2014legislation based on that 2020 executive order.\n\n\u201cIt was a big signal that this was potentially fruitful ground for Republicans, and of course, it rippled out in a pretty significant way,\u201d said Steven Brint, a professor of sociology and public policy at the University of California, Riverside.\n\nKaleb Briscoe, an assistant professor of adult and higher education at the University of Oklahoma who studies campuses\u2019 racial climates and hate crimes, and other experts say the attacks on DEI and Trump\u2019s time in office inflamed tensions on some campuses and spurred an increase in bias-related incidents, such as students leaving nooses around campuses or wearing blackface.\n\n\u201cWe have not recovered within higher education,\u201d she said, \u201cand it would be catastrophic if he had another term.\u201d",

        "text": "In Dearborn, home of largest Arab American community, despair and apathy dominate\nAbu Bilal sits quietly on a stool in Oriental Fashion, a clothing store he owns on Dearborn\u2019s Warren Avenue, listening to the radio. It\u2019s hard to ascertain whether his tone when talking about the war in Gaza is one of near-complete defeatism or seething anger.\n\n\u201cNinety people were killed today; hundreds were injured,\u201d he says, referencing an Israeli airstrike that killed dozens of Palestinian civilians in Khan Younis on Saturday.\n\n\u201cNo one is talking about it; no one cares. I have one question: where is the humanity?\u201d\n\nOn a scorching Saturday afternoon in Dearborn, Michigan, the feeling of despairing resignation over the war and the role America\u2019s political leaders are playing in enabling the suffering in the besieged territory is near-omnipresent \u2013 and so is a sense of apathy over the coming presidential election.\n\nDown Maple Street, a man getting a haircut at the Al-Rehab Barber Shop says in Arabic that regardless of who the president is or will be following November\u2019s election, it\u2019s not going to make any difference to him. The barber says that he didn\u2019t vote in the 2020 presidential election and doesn\u2019t plan to vote in November. Both refused to offer their names, saying they prefer not to be identified for their political views.\n\nAs the death toll continues to mount in Gaza with little sign of a political solution forthcoming, the mood in America\u2019s largest Arab American community in recent months and weeks has decidedly changed. While flags and protests against Israel\u2019s assault on Gaza, which has now killed more than 38,000 people, drew fervent energy and anger to Dearborn\u2019s streets when the city became a protest hub around the state\u2019s presidential primary, the sense today seems one of resignation and anger at America\u2019s political leadership.\n\nFor Joe Biden, who won the key battleground state of Michigan in 2020 by just 154,000 votes, that could be deeply damaging come November.\n\nWhen the US president defeated Donald Trump en route to the White House in 2020, turnout in Dearborn was around 10% higher than the previous election four years earlier. Biden also won 10% more votes than the Democratic party\u2019s previous presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, suggesting voters in Dearborn four years ago were energized.\n\nToday, that positivity is nowhere to be found. During the Democratic party\u2019s primary in February, 6,432 Dearborn voters chose \u201cuncommitted\u201d in protest of Biden\u2019s support for Israel\u2019s war, out of a total of 100,000 Michiganders who did the same. A Pew Research Center survey from May found that both Biden and Trump were the least-liked pair of presidential candidates in at least three decades. Trump currently holds a narrow lead in the state according to polls.\n\nThere is little sign that support among Arab Americans has rebounded since the peak of the uncommitted movement\u2019s strength earlier this year. According to a poll conducted by the Arab American Institute in May, Biden has the support of less than 20% of Arab Americans \u2013 down from nearly 60% in 2020. The poll estimates he could lose 91,000 votes in Michigan alone.\n\nWhen members of Biden\u2019s election campaign team visited Dearborn in January, they were met on one occasion by an empty room after Dearborn\u2019s mayor, Abdullah Hammoud, and two other Arab American state representatives declined to meet with the team, rejecting a campaign meeting to discuss elections rather than a substantive discussion about the war.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re planning on sending campaign officials to convince the Arab American community on why they should vote for your candidate, don\u2019t do it on the same day you announce selling fighter jets to the tyrants murdering our family members,\u201d Hammoud wrote on X at the time.\n\nOn Friday, Biden held a campaign rally at a school a few miles north of Dearborn, but for the most part his campaign\u2019s overtures to Arab Americans across the country have been rejected.\n\n\u201cThe whole community was aware [that the administration had sent campaign officials to meet with the community], and I think it says a lot, that he sees us as no more than votes and that it\u2019s been normalized for our people back home to be killed,\u201d says Jenin Yaseen, an artist whose family is from a village outside Nablus in the occupied West Bank.\n\nShe says didn\u2019t vote in 2020 and doesn\u2019t plan to do so this year. \u201cI don\u2019t think that we see that there\u2019s a distinguishment between Trump and Biden,\u201d she says. She added that her position would not change should Biden step aside and Kamala Harris take his place at the top of the Democratic ticket. \u201cKamala Harris\u2019 stance around Palestine is pretty much the same. She\u2019s just as guilty as Joe Biden is.\u201d\n\nShe says anger among Dearborn\u2019s Arab American communities has simmered for years.\n\n\u201cDearborn is made up of people from Yemen, Iraq, Lebanon and elsewhere that have been directly impacted by American imperialism,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s also this big sense of guilt being here.\u201d\n\nBut a victory for Trump could be devastating for Arab Americans with family in the Middle East.\n\nUnder the previous Trump administration, raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcements (Ice) officers and deportation orders drove fear into the heart of the community. While Biden is on track to match the Trump administration\u2019s number of deportation orders by focusing on border regions rather than the interior US, the president in February signed an order protecting around 6,000 Palestinians from deportation for 18 months.\n\nThe proprietor at Nabil Hair Salon on Warren Avenue says he\u2019d like to offer his views but was afraid it could affect him and his business.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not looking for any attention,\u201d he says, asking not to be identified by name. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what could happen if we talk politics.\u201d",

        "text": "How Germany is preparing for a Trump presidency \u2013 DW \u2013 07\nGerman leaders are hoping US President Joe Biden will be re-elected. But they are preparing for a Donald Trump victory \u2014 which some say they failed to do the first time round.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz from the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) has a close and friendly relationship with US President Joe Biden. Scholz has made no secret of his hope that Biden will beat Republican challenger Donald Trump in the presidential election later this year.\n\nThat's a mistake, says Jens Spahn of Germany's largest opposition party, the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), which was in a coalition with the SPD during Trump's first term in office from 2016 to 2020.\n\n\"I think Trump will very likely be the next president of the US,\" Spahn told DW on the sidelines of the Republican convention in Milwaukee this week. \"We shouldn't make the same mistake we did during his last presidency. Back then, no one had a network of contacts with Trump's team. This time we should know beforehand and build up contacts with him and his team. That's why it's important to be here.\"\n\n'Without the US, Europe can't be secure': German lawmaker To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nUncertain future for Ukraine\n\nConcern has mounted in Germany with the nomination of JD Vance as Trump's running mate, who has doubled down on cutting US support for Ukraine. \"I don't really care what happens to Ukraine,\" Vance famously said in an interview with former Trump adviser, Steve Bannon, just a few days before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nLeading German figures are paying heed to the warning. Under Trump's leadership, \"the US would set different priorities. Europe would have to take care of its own defense and also take on most of the burden of supporting Ukraine,\" Christoph Heusgen, chairman of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) told the news agency Reuters.\n\nTrump had in fact already demanded that Germany and Europe step up their own defense during his presidency.\n\n\"But the problem is that Germany and Europe are much more vulnerable today than they were in 2016, because Russia is not only threatening Ukraine, but the whole of Europe, and Europe is still very dependent on the US in terms of security policy,\" Dominik Tolksdorf from the German Council on Foreign Relations (DGAP) told DW.\n\n\"However, Europeans can at least assess Trump better today than in 2016,\" he added. \"If Donald Trump were to win the election, we should still look for ways to maintain reasonably constructive relations.\"\n\nLong-range US weapons in Germany\n\nBehind the scenes, German leaders have long been preparing for a possible second Trump presidency, according to Michael Link, a lawmaker of the smallest party in Scholz's coalition, the neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP).\n\nLink is the the German government's transatlantic coordinator, and also attended the US Republican Party convention in Milwaukee as a guest. \"The biggest challenge for any preparations is Trump's unpredictability,\" Link told DW. \"No one can say for sure which parts of his political program Trump would implement in a second term. We must therefore strengthen our own ability to act. That goes for the European Union above all.\"\n\nIn response to the perceived threat from Russia, Germany has significantly boosted its defense spending. Chancellor Scholz took a further step just a few days ago at the NATO summit in Washington, where he agreed with President Biden to station long-range US weapons in Germany.\n\n\"Many of the weapons systems that have now been agreed on were first considered during Trump's presidency,\" Tim Thies of the Institute for Peace Research and Security Policy in Hamburg told DW. And in fact, according to German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, Germany will foot the bill for the deployment. \"The German government seems to be anticipating any demands from a possible future President Trump,\" Thies remarked.\n\nWould a Trump presidency hurt German firms?

Several of them had made some extremely undiplomatic comments during that election campaign, most notably then-Foreign Minister and current German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who called Trump a \"hate preacher.\"\n\nMichael Link points out that Biden respects Germany as a partner, and also the EU as an institution and has invested much in multilateral partnerships such as the G7 and the UN.\n\nA second Trump administration would be dramatically different, Link fears: \"Trump relies on bilateral relations and new transactional 'deals' instead of existing alliances. He does not respect the EU as an equal partner and would try to play the European states off against each other,\" Link warned.\n\nHowever, he is also certain: \"If Donald Trump is re-elected, despite all the America First rhetoric, he will realize that the US will still be dependent on allies,\" said Link, pointing to relations with China as an example: \"The US and the EU can have a much greater impact if they work together instead of working against each other.\"\n\nThis article was originally written in German.\n\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

        "text": "Statement at the European Parliament Plenary by President Ursula von der Leyen, candidate for a second mandate 2024-2029\n\u201cCheck against delivery\u201d\n\nDear President Metsola, dear Roberta,\n\nLet, me first congratulate you from the bottom of my heart for your re-nomination. Your success is a mirror of the outstanding work you have been doing in this House of European Democracy.\n\nHonourable Members,\n\nIt is now five years since I first came to ask for your confidence. Five years like no other in our Union's history. I will always remember the spine-tingling moments we shared together in this hemicycle. From standing in front of you, asking for your confidence five years ago to proposing NextGenerationEU. From the appearances of President Zelenskyy when even the translators could not hold back their tears to the empty chair poignantly left out for Alexei Navalny as his daughter spoke on his behalf. From the moments of silence for those we lost in the pandemic to the moments of song for the Ode to Joy or Auld Lang Syne. And I will never forget the last words of David Sassoli calling for a more united Europe. This Parliament understands the weight of this moment's history.\n\nHonourable Members,\n\nChoices are the hinges of destiny. And in a world full of adversity, Europe's destiny hinges on what we do next. Despite the momentous things we have done and overcome, Europe now faces a clear choice. A choice which will shape our work for 5 years and define our place in the world for the next 50. The choice comes down to whether we will be shaped by events and the world around us or whether we will come together and build our future for ourselves. And that choice is ours. Europe cannot control dictators and demagogues across the world, but it can choose to protect its own democracy. Europe cannot determine elections across the world, but it can choose to invest in the security and defence of its own continent. Europe cannot stop change, but it can choose to embrace it by investing in a new age of prosperity and improving our quality of life.\n\nBut, Honourable Members, for us to choose the Europe of tomorrow, we must acknowledge how people feel today. We are in a period of deep anxiety and uncertainty for Europeans. Families are feeling the pain from the cost of living and housing. Young people are concerned about the planet, their future and the prospect of war. Companies and farmers are feeling squeezed. All of this is a symptom of a world in which everything is weaponised and contested. Where there is a clear attempt to divide and polarise our societies. I am deeply concerned about these trends. But I am convinced that Europe \u2013 a strong Europe \u2013 can rise to the challenge. And this is why I am asking for your confidence today. Because, just like you, I came into politics to make a difference for all of society to deliver for the generation of my children and grandchildren, like those who came before us did. I am convinced that the version of Europe since the end of World War II, with all of its imperfections and inequalities, is still the best version in history. I will never stand by and watch it be torn apart from the inside or the outside. I will never let the extreme polarisation of our societies become accepted. And I will never accept that demagogues and extremists destroy our European way of life. And I stand here today ready to lead this fight with all of the democratic forces here in this House.\n\nHonourable Members,\n\nThis is the vision I have set out in my Political Guidelines. A vision of a stronger Europe that delivers prosperity, that protects people and that defends democracy. A stronger Europe that delivers social fairness and supports people. A stronger Europe that implements what it agrees in a fair way. And that sticks to the targets of the European Green Deal with pragmatism, technology-neutrality and innovation. I have listened carefully to the democratic forces in this Parliament and I am convinced that these Guidelines reflect how much we have in common, despite the differences that are healthy in any democracy.\n\nHonourable Members,\n\nOur first priority will be prosperity and competitiveness. In the last five years, we have weathered the fiercest storm in our Union's economic history. We have emerged stronger from the shock of lockdowns, and we have overcome an unprecedented energy crisis. We did this together, and I believe we can be proud of it. But we also know that our competitiveness needs a major boost. The fundamentals of the global economy are changing. Those who stand still will fall behind. Those who are not competitive will be dependent. The race is on and I want Europe to switch gear. And this starts with making business easier and faster. We need to deepen our Single Market across the board. We need less reporting, less bureaucracy, and more trust, better enforcement and faster permitting. And I will ensure that we are accountable for this. Because only what gets measured gets done. Therefore, I will task each Commissioner to deep dive in their portfolio, and to deliver concretely on burden reduction. And I will appoint a Vice-President to coordinate this work and to report on progress to this House once a year. I will also introduce a revamped SME and competitiveness check as part of our Better Regulation toolbox. We all know there is no Europe without SMEs. They are the heart of our economy. Therefore, let us get rid of the burdensome micromanagement, and give them more trust and better incentives.\n\nHonourable Members,\n\nLet me give you some figures. To start: in the first half of this year, 50% of our electricity generation came from renewables \u2013 home-grown and clean. Investments in clean technologies in Europe have more than tripled in this mandate. We attract more investments in clean hydrogen than the US and China combined. Finally, in the last years, we have concluded with global partners 35 new agreements on clean tech, hydrogen and critical raw materials. This is the European Green Deal in action. So I want to be clear. We will stay the course on our new growth strategy and the goals we set for 2030 and 2050. Our focus now will be on implementation and investment to make it happen on the ground. This is why I will put forward a new Clean Industrial Deal in the first 100 days. It will channel investment in infrastructure and industry, in particular for energy-intensive sectors. This will help create lead markets in everything from clean steel to clean tech and it will speed up planning, tendering, and permitting. We must be faster and simpler. Because Europe is decarbonising and industrialising at the same time. Our companies need predictability, for their investments and innovation. And yes, they can rely on us. In this logic, we will enshrine our 90% target for 2040 in our European Climate Law. Our companies need to plan their investments for the coming decade already today. And this is not only about business. For our young people, 2030, 2040, 2050 is around the corner. They know that we have to reconcile climate protection with a prosperous economy. And they would never forgive us if we do not rise to the challenge. So, this is not only a matter of competitiveness, but also a matter of intergenerational fairness. The young people deserve it.\n\nThe new Clean Industrial Deal will also help bring down energy bills. We all know that structurally high energy prices hamper our competitiveness. And high energy bills are a major driver of energy poverty for people. I have not forgotten how Putin blackmailed us by cutting us off from Russian fossil fuels. But we withstood together. We invested massively in homegrown cheap renewables. And this enabled us to break free from dirty Russian fossil fuels. Therefore, together, we will ensure that the era of dependency on Russian fossil fuels is over. Once and for all.\n\nHonourable Members,\n\nEurope needs more investment, from farming to industry, from digital to strategic technologies but also more investment in people and their skills. This mandate has to be the time of investment. This starts with completing our Capital Markets Union and mobilising more private financing. Every year EUR 300 billion of European families' savings go from Europe to foreign markets, because our capital market is too fragmented. And then this money is often used to buy innovative European companies from abroad. This has to change. We need to leverage this enormous wealth to create growth here in Europe. This is why we will propose a European Savings and Investments Union. European start-ups should not need to look at the US or Asia to finance their expansion. They must find what they need to grow right here in Europe. We need a deep and liquid capital market. And we need a competition policy that supports companies to scale up. Europe must be the home of opportunity and innovation.\n\nHonourable Members,\n\nTo unleash private investment, we also need public funding. Yes, we have the resources in NextGenerationEU and the current budget. But this will come to an end within the next few years. While our investment needs will not. We need more investment capacity. Our new budget will be reinforced. It must be more focused on policies, simpler for Member States and more impactful, so that we use its power to leverage more private and public financing. And I will propose a new European Competitiveness Fund. It will be focused on common and cross-border European projects that will drive competitiveness and innovation \u2013 notably to support the Clean Industrial Deal. It will ensure that we develop strategic tech and manufacture it here, in Europe. So, from AI to clean tech, the future of our prosperity must be made in Europe.\n\nHonourable Members,\n\nWe must also invest more in our security and defence. Russia is still on the offensive in East Ukraine. They are banking on a war of attrition, on making the next winter even harsher than the last. Russia is banking on Europe and the West going soft. And some, in Europe, are playing along. Two weeks ago, an EU Prime Minister went to Moscow. This so-called peace mission was nothing but an appeasement mission. Only two days later, Putin's jets aimed their missiles at a children's hospital and maternity ward in Kyiv. We all saw the images of children covered in blood, and mothers trying to bring young cancer patients to safety. That strike was not a mistake. It was a message. A chilling message from the Kremlin to all of us. So, Honourable Members, our answer has to be just as clear. No one wants peace more than the people of Ukraine. A just and lasting peace for a free and independent country. And Europe will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes.\n\nHonourable Members,\n\nWe must give Ukraine everything it needs to resist and prevail. This implies making fundamental choices for our future. For the first time in decades our freedom is under threat. It is our responsibility to do all that is necessary to protect our European citizens. Protecting Europe is Europe's duty. I believe now is therefore the time to build a true European Defence Union. Yes, I know there are some who are perhaps uncomfortable with the idea. But what we should be uncomfortable about are the threats to our security. Let us be clear: Member States will retain responsibility for their national security and their armies. And NATO will remain the pillar of our collective defence. But we all know very well that our spending on defence is too low and ineffective. Our foreign spending is too great. We must therefore create a single market for defence. We must invest more in high-end defence capabilities. In other words, Europe must continue along the path laid down by the Versailles Declaration. We need to invest more. We need to invest together. And we must set up common European projects. For example, a comprehensive aerial defence system \u2013 a European Air Shield, not only to protect our airspace but as a strong symbol of European unity in defence matters.\n\nHonourable Members,\n\nSecurity is not only about external threats. Cyber and hybrid threats are growing. Organised criminal networks are infiltrating our economy; most of them use corruption. They are causing fear and innocent people's death with their brutal violence. They earn enormous amounts of money from drug trafficking, ransomware, fraud, trafficking in human beings and they are not limited by national borders. It is necessary that we respond to this growing threat on a European level. We must make sure that police can work across Europe without borders. This is why I will propose to double Europol's staff and strengthen its mandate. I want Europol to become a truly operational police agency.\n\nAnd we must also do more to secure our external borders. Our Eastern Border in particular has become a target for hybrid attacks and provocations. Russia is luring migrants from Yemen up north and pushing them deliberately against the Finnish border. We should always keep in mind that a Member State's border is a European border. And we will do everything we can to make them stronger. This is part of the reason why we must strengthen Frontex. To make it more effective, while fully respecting fundamental rights, I will propose to triple the number of European border and coastguards to 30,000.\n\nMore secure borders will also help us to manage migration in a more structured and fair way. The Migration and Asylum Pact is a huge step forward. We put solidarity at the heart of our common response. Migration challenges need a European response with a fair and firm approach based on our values. Always remembering that migrants are human beings like you and me. And all of us, we are protected by human rights. Many pessimists thought that migration was too divisive to agree on. But we proved them wrong. Together we made it. And we have emerged stronger from it. Now, we must collectively focus on implementation and on supporting Member States in making it a reality on the ground. And there will be more to do. We need a common approach on returns, to make them more effective and dignified. And we need to develop our comprehensive partnerships, in particular across our Southern neighbourhood. The Mediterranean region should get undivided attention. This is why I will appoint a Commissioner for the region, and propose a new Agenda for the Mediterranean together with Kaja Kallas. Because the future of the two Mediterranean shores is one and the same.\n\nHonourable Members,\n\nOur neighbourhood is home to our future. Inviting countries into our Union is a moral, a historical and a political responsibility. It is an enormous geostrategic responsibility for Europe. Because in today's world a larger Union will be a stronger Union. It will strengthen our voice in the world. It will help reduce our dependencies. And it will ensure that democracy, prosperity and stability spread across Europe. We will support candidates, by working on investment and reforms and integrating them where we can into our legal frameworks. Accession will always be a merit-based process. And we will ensure that all countries are ready, before joining. But completing our Union is also in our core interest. And it will be a core priority for my Commission. History is calling once again. The Western Balkans, Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia have made their free choice. They have chosen freedom over oppression. They have chosen democracy over dependency. And some of them are paying a high price for this choice. So we must make our choice, and show steadfast commitment. Their future will be free and prosperous, inside our Union.\n\nHonourable Members,\n\nEurope has a responsibility to play an active role in the world, starting in our neighbourhood and in particular in the Middle East. I want to be clear: the bloodshed in Gaza must stop now. Too many children, women and civilians have lost their lives as a result of Israel's response to Hamas' brutal terror. The people of Gaza cannot bear any more. Humanity cannot bear it. We need an immediate and enduring ceasefire. We need the release of Israeli hostages. And we need to prepare the day after. Europe must play its part. We have massively increased our humanitarian aid to almost EUR 200 million in 2024. And we will do more. We are now working on a much larger multi-year package to support an effective Palestinian Authority. The two-state solution is the best way to ensure security of both, to Israelis and Palestinians. People in the Middle East deserve peace, security and prosperity. And Europe will be at their side.\n\nHonourable Members,\n\nEurope offers a unique quality of life. From comprehensive social security to first-class regional food products. Rapeseed fields, vineyards and fruit orchards not only mean good food and drink, they are also part of our homeland. And that is why the future of agriculture is such an important and sensitive issue for us in Europe. We must overcome differences and develop good solutions together with all stakeholders. That is why I launched the Strategic Dialogue on the Future of Agriculture in Europe. It brings farmers, environmental groups and experts from across the food chain to the table. I have promised to listen to them carefully and to learn from them. And I shall do so. I will take on board good recommendations and present a new European strategy for our agriculture and the food sector. I will make sure that farmers receive a fair income. No one should be forced to sell good food below production costs. We must strengthen the position of our farmers in the food industry value chain. And we need smarter incentives and more innovation and access to capital. Anyone who manages nature and biodiversity in a sustainable way and helps to balance the carbon budget must be properly rewarded. Our farmers shape our landscapes. They shape the face of Europe. They are part of our culture. They provide food security. And we are proud of them.\n\nThat is why we must work together to tackle the problems bearing down on them. They feel climate change. Every year they are more and more affected by extreme weather and water scarcity. Temperatures in Europe are rising twice as fast as the global average. We are already seeing the devastating effects on fields and in forests. The face of our rural communities is changing. We must do more to ensure that our farmers are better prepared for what climate change holds in store for us. That is why I will present a plan for agriculture to address the need to adapt to climate change and, in parallel, a strategy for sustainable management of the precious resource of water. Not only our food security depends on it, but also our overall competitiveness.\n\nHonourable Members,\n\nOur quality of life and our very social fabric are unique. We made historic steps forward on our Pillar of Social Rights \u2013 from minimum wages to the first-ever Child Guarantee. During the pandemic, we saved 40 million jobs with SURE. And we can be proud of that. But many new challenges have emerged \u2013 from the impact of AI to mental health at work and new drivers of poverty. We need a new action plan for the implementation of the Pillar. We must ensure fair transitions and good working conditions for workers and self-employed people. And crucial for that is Social Dialogue \u2013 the hallmark of our social market economy. We will therefore work to increase collective bargaining and strengthen European Social Dialogue. And we will address those issues that Europeans feel the most in their daily lives. Take housing. Europe faces a housing crisis, with people of all ages and families of all sizes affected. Prices and rents are soaring. People are struggling to find affordable homes. This is why, for the first time, I will appoint a Commissioner with direct responsibility for housing. We will develop a European Affordable Housing Plan, to look at all the drivers of the crisis and to help unlock the private and public investment needed. Typically, housing is not seen as a European issue. Some might say we should not get involved. But I want this Commission to support people where it matters the most. If it matters to Europeans, it matters to Europe.\n\nHonourable Members,\n\nThis is how we can strengthen our society. This means ensuring that every region, in every part of Europe, is supported. No one is left behind. I am committed to a strong cohesion policy, designed together with regions and local authorities. I want Europe to be the best place to grow up in, and the best place to grow old in. We must enable young people to make the most of Europe's freedoms, from a stronger Erasmus+ to more citizen engagement. But we must also do more to protect young people. Childhood and teenage years are the time when our character is formed, our personality develops, and our brain is shaped by triggers and emotions. This is a time of amazing development but also real vulnerability. And we see more and more reporting on what some call a mental health crisis. We need to get to the bottom of this. I believe social media, and excessive screen time and addictive practices, have played their part. My heart bleeds when I read about young people harming themselves or even taking their lives because of online abuse. I think of those last moments and the pain they must have felt. I think of their parents and their friends. And this is devastating. We can never accept this in our society. We will tackle the plague of cyber-bullying. We will take action against the addictive design of some platforms. And we will convene the first-ever European-wide enquiry on the impact of social media on the wellbeing of young people. We owe it to them. And we will not rest until we have done right by them.\n\nHonourable Members,\n\nOne of the most fundamental choices we face is what kind of society we want for our children and grandchildren. And in particular for our daughters and granddaughters. On women's rights, we have achieved together the unthinkable, thanks to the amazing solidarity in this House of European Democracy, across party lines. After ten years of struggle, we have unblocked the Women on Boards Directive. We have achieved huge progress on pay transparency \u2013 there is not the slightest reason why women should be paid less than men for the same work. But there is still so much to do. Stop the rise in violence against women. Reconcile care and career, not only for women, but women are mostly affected. Close the pay and pensions gap. It is no coincidence that poverty in old age has a female face. And there is much more to do. So let us work together to develop a Roadmap for Women's Rights. Let us keep moving forward. If not now, then when?\n\nHonourable Members,\n\nDemocracy is our common treasure. It is the forum in which our differences and disagreements can be voiced. And it is as vital as it is fragile. For a very long time, we took it for granted. We became democrats of comfort. But today our democracies are under threat. For more than two years, Russia has been relentlessly waging war on European soil, in Ukraine. Throughout the EU and within our institutions, our services and journalists \u2013 whose work I wish to commend here \u2013 have been uncovering cases of spying, cyber-attacks, corruption and disinformation by foreign actors, in particular the Russians and Chinese. The threat level and the level of hybrid attacks have not been so high for decades. At the Commission, we are very much aware of this and have been taking responsible action for several years. A major analysis has been conducted and the first effective tools have been rolled out, in close cooperation with Member States. But we must go further. We must prevent hostile foreign actors from interfering in our democratic processes, undermining them and, ultimately, destroying them. To do this, we must take strong measures at European level.\n\nIf you lend me your confidence today, the Commission will propose a European Democracy Shield. The EU needs its own dedicated structure for countering foreign information manipulation and interference. It will pool all expertise and link up and coordinate with existing national agencies. Intelligence and detection capabilities must be bolstered, together with the ability to act and impose sanctions. The Shield will take into account recommendations from the work of the special committees on foreign interference, to better protect our democracies. There is an urgent need to provide the European Union with powerful cyber-defence tools, to impose transparency on foreign funding of our public life as a common rule, but also to guarantee a reliable information framework. For this, the EU must support an independent press, continue to ensure rules are observed by digital giants, and further encourage media literacy programmes. European democracy must be more participative, more vibrant. Civil society must be better supported and defended. I know I can count on your support to realise this major plan to defend European democracy.\n\nHonourable Members,\n\nBut we will also step up our work on defending all parts of our democracy. We will protect our free media and civil society. The rule of law and the fight against corruption will be at the heart of our work. We will strengthen all of our tools and we will step up our enforcement. We will ensure our Rule of Law Report focuses on the Single Market dimension to help protect companies. And we will keep to a very clear principle in our budget. Respecting the rule of law is a must for EU funds. In this budget, and in the future, with the conditionality mechanism. It is non-negotiable. Because this is the core of our European way of life.\n\nHonourable Members,\n\nOur Union and our democracy are constant work in progress. And there is more that we can do. We need an ambitious reform agenda to ensure the functioning of a larger Union and to increase democratic legitimacy. While reforms were necessary before, with enlargement they become indispensable. We must use this as a catalyst for change in terms of our capacity to act, our policies and our budget. We will of course focus on what we can already do, of which there is a lot. But we should be more ambitious. I believe we need Treaty change where it can improve our Union. And I want to work on that with this House. And this will be part of a closer partnership between the Commission and the Parliament. I have listened to your demands and concerns. I continue to support your right of initiative and we will increase our cooperation on Article 225 Resolutions to ensure we follow up. So I am ready to work on all parts of our partnership. We need to revise the Framework Agreement to ensure more transparency, more accountability and more presence in the Parliament. When all institutions move together, Europe moves forward too.\n\nHonourable Members,\n\nAt the start of his second mandate Jacques Delors said: \u00ab Notre Communaut\u00e9 est non seulement le fruit de l'histoire et de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9, mais aussi de la volont\u00e9. \u00bb This is the fundamental choice that we face. History will keep knocking on Europe's door. The need for Europe will be stronger than ever. Our determination has to match it. This is what has brought our continent together. Not the inscrutable forces of fate, but the power of people striving for more. Like the three prisoners on Ventotene Island in the 40s who laid out the vision of a united continent. And the post-war generation, who built peace on coal and steel. People who stood unarmed in the face of Soviet tanks, who put carnations into rifles, and tore down a wall with their bare hands. People who still risk their life today, for this dream called Europe. Generation after generation have made Europe, have chosen a strong Europe. And now that responsibility is up to us. The last five years have shown what we can do together. Let us do it again. Let us make the choice of strength. Let us make the choice of leadership. Let us make the choice of Europe.\n\nThank you and long live Europe.\n\nRelated media",

Vance\u2019s ties to tech billionaires\n\ntoggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nWhile Ohio Senator J.D. Vance\u2019s Appalachian roots are well-known, thanks to his best-selling memoir \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d another aspect of Vance\u2019s background is now gaining attention: His connection to prominent Silicon Valley billionaires.\n\nVance\u2019s 2016 book about the struggles of his childhood was published right around the time he began to quietly cement his ties to a cadre of mega-wealthy tech powerbrokers who could be considered the opposite of the Rust Belt\u2019s working class.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nNow, as President Trump\u2019s pick for vice president, many elite tech leaders are coalescing around the GOP ticket and expected to help bankroll Trump\u2019s re-election bid.\n\nHere are five things to know about why the tech billionaire class is backing Vance, and what it means for the 2024 presidential election.\n\nElon Musk and influential venture capitalists are leading the charge to support Trump/Vance\n\nMusk endorsed Trump just minutes after a gunman in Pennsylvania tried to assassinate the former President in Pennsylvania, and he doubled down on the support when Trump announced Vance as his running mate.\n\nDuring his time working in venture capital in San Francisco, Vance became a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Peter Thiel, a PayPal co-founder who is considered something of a kingmaker in Silicon Valley. When Vance ran for Senate, Thiel fueled his run with a $15 million donation.\n\nVance also made inroads with David Sacks, a former tech executive and podcaster who has become a loud cheerleader for Musk since the billionaire acquired Twitter, now X. Sacks recently held a Trump fundraiser at his home in San Francisco, raking in $12 million for the former president. Sacks this week spoke at the Republican National Convention, where he spent much of his time bashing President Biden over the U.S. supporting Ukraine in its war with Russia.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nUsing X as a megaphone, Musk and Sacks have been blasting out daily rallying cries for Trump and Vance. \u201cCome on in,\u201d Sacks wrote on X on Tuesday following a list of prominent tech figures now backing Trump. \u201cThe water\u2019s warm.\u201d\n\nTech billionaires are already giving millions and expected to turbocharge Trump/Vance campaign\n\nShortly after Vance was announced as Trump\u2019s VP pick, a new tech-aligned super political action committee was unveiled called America PAC.\n\nWith the backing of the crypto billionaire Winklevoss twins, the co-founder data analytics firm Palantir Joe Lonsdale, Doug Leone of powerful VC Sequoia Capital and others, the group has raised more than $8 million, according to a recent Federal Election Commission filing.\n\nThe group\u2019s war chest could turn into a formidable force for the Trump campaign.\n\nAndreessen and Horowitz are on tap to pump the group with cash. And the Wall Street Journal has reported that Elon Musk could funnel as much as $45 million a month into the effort.\n\nTrump\u2019s Vance pick has drawn praise in crypto circles, with investors hoping for lax regulations of the digital currency. In his latest federal financial disclosure, Vance reported that he owns between $100,000 and $250,000 in Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nTech elite see Vance as change-agent on tax policy, AI and crypto regulations\n\nMarc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, who operate the prominent venture capital firm named after them, released a podcast on Tuesday laying out their rationale for backing Trump and Vance.\n\nHorowitz said he was reluctant to wade into politics, but that he had no other choice, since \u201cthe future of our business, the future of technology, new technology, and the future of America is literally at stake,\u201d he said.\n\nThe duo said the Biden administration\u2019s proposed regulations for cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence are too heavy-handed. They said they fear a second Biden term would crimp American innovation.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nTheir firm has invested in numerous crypto and AI startups, big bets on those two industries, said Samuel Hammond, an economist with the right-leaning think tank Foundation for American Innovation.\n\n\u201cWhether that bet pays off depends entirely on the policy of the U.S. government,\" Hammond told NPR.\n\nAndreessen, who has historically supported Democrats, said the \u201cfinal straw\u201d with his shift away from Biden was the president\u2019s policy aimed at the super rich: a 25% tax on unrealized gains on households that are worth more than $100 million.\n\nThat kind of levy on the wealthiest Americans \u201cmakes start-ups completely implausible,\u201d Andreessen claimed on the podcast. \u201cVenture capital just ends. Firms like ours just don\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nThe remarks underscore a fusing of the right-wing flank of Silicon Valley and Trump's populist movement.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s any unifying ideology to the rising right in Silicon Valley it\u2019s a sense that the system is broken and also the parallel sense that they can build a better system,\" Hammond said.\n\n\n\nTech billionaires endorsing Trump and Vance as way to rail against perceived \u2018wokeism\u2019\n\nWhile many of the tech moguls supporting Trump and Vance tout policy positions that favor Silicon Valley, another element is that the tech elite are now embracing the GOP ticket as being on the side of a rebellion against liberals.\n\nWhether it is railing against diversity, equity and inclusion rules, or policies supporting transgender youth, Musk, Sacks and others in the tech elite used X to go on the offensive on culture war issues.\n\nIn Vance, not only do they have someone who has called \u201cthe DEI agenda a destructive ideology,\u201d but a person who wants to fight the culture war with a background in venture capital.\n\n\u201cMany of these guys who previously identified as libertarian are now sort of re-imagining themselves, or pivoting themselves, to a kind of right-wing populism, to Trumpism. And Vance is a really great example of that,\u201d said Max Chafkin, who wrote \u201cThe Contrarian: Peter Thiel and Silicon Valley\u2019s Pursuit of Power,\u201d which discusses Vance.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cJ.D. Vance is seen as one of theirs,\u201d Chafkin added. \u201cHe also has policy positions that can be perceived as being friendly to tech,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think that is secondary to the identity piece of this.\u201d\n\nAdds economist Hammond: \"To them, there is government by managers, by a woke DEI office,\" he said. \"Or government by entrepreneurs.\"\n\nNot all of Silicon Valley is behind MAGA, but support is growing in venture capital world\n\nLarge swaths of the tech world are still very much deeply liberal. Rank-and-file tech workers at big companies and smaller startups tend to favor Democrats and their donations typically support left-leaning causes.\n\nThe Information, a technology news site popular in Silicon Valley, conducted a reader survey this week and found that nearly 60% of respondents plan to vote for President Biden in November.\n\nYet when it comes to tech financiers and their elite friends, it is another story, said author Chafkin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tempting to paint this with a broad brush and say all of Silicon Valley is getting behind the former president, but what\u2019s actually happening is that Silicon Valley\u2019s right wing has been activated and persuaded to open their pockets,\u201d he said.\n\nExecutives of the biggest companies, like Apple, Nvidia, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Google have not endorsed any candidate, keeping with the tradition of Big Tech leadership staying on the sidelines of presidential elections.",

        "text": "America\u2019s Political Violence Crisis\nOne night in January, 15 people trudged into an arts center in Nazareth, Pa., for a political focus group. Democrats and Republicans, grandmothers and high school teachers, they gathered in a room still decorated with Christmas lights to discuss their concerns about the democratic process with a group called Keep Our Republic, a non-partisan civic organization that focuses on threats to the election system. Ari Mittleman, the organization\u2019s executive director, has observed similar events across the battleground states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, so he expected the participants in Nazareth to express negative views about the 2024 elections, the candidates, and even the voting process itself. What Mittleman was not prepared for was a dark prediction that the panelists shared.\n\n\u201cThe one thing that unified Democrats and Republicans,\u201d says Mittleman, was the strong sense that \u201cthis election will see political violence.\u201d In a recording of the Nazareth session shared with TIME, many participants said they believed it was a matter of when, not if, someone would be seriously injured or killed during the 2024 election cycle. \u201cIt was beyond unsettling,\u201d Mittleman recalls. \u201cAlmost to a person, they were saying that political violence was going to happen.\u201d\n\nWhen it did happen on July 13 in Butler, Pa., the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump shocked the nation. But to many, it did not come as a surprise. The harrowing scene was surreal yet predictable, and not only because the U.S. has an ugly history of attacks against Presidents and presidential candidates. The gunshots fired by a skinny 20-year-old perched on a roof overlooking the Butler Farm Show grounds were a reminder of America\u2019s political reality in 2024, which has been warped by increasingly violent rhetoric, threats, and attacks.\n\nRead More: The United States of American Violence\n\nFor years, polls have traced a sharp rise in the share of Americans who believe violence is a valid means to achieve their political goals. In a December 2021 survey by the Washington Post and the University of Maryland, 1 in 3 respondents said they thought violent action against the government can be justified, compared with fewer than 1 in 10 in the 1990s. In an April PBS/Marist poll, 28% of Republicans and 12% of Democrats said they believe Americans may \u201chave to resort to violence to get the country back on track.\u201d In June, 10% of respondents surveyed by the University of Chicago\u2019s Project on Security and Threats said that the \u201cuse of force is justified to prevent Donald Trump from becoming President.\u201d\n\nSecret Service surrounds Trump after shots were fired at the Butler, Pa., rally on July 13 Evan Vucci\u2014AP\n\nThis trend has coincided with a documented surge in violent threats, harassment, and physical attacks targeting elected and civic officials, from prominent legislators and governors to small-town election clerks and school-board members. The wave of invective and intimidation has hollowed out local institutions, disrupted systems of law and government, drummed dedicated public servants out of office, and deterred others from running, especially women and people of color.\n\nRead More: Public Officials Face Surge of Threats Ahead of 2024 Election\n\nTo many Americans, the prospect of political violence has become immediate and visible. More people are bringing guns to demonstrations. Every politically charged event, from Supreme Court decisions to Trump\u2019s trials to congressional hearings, elicits menacing warnings and talk of \u201ccivil war.\u201d The last presidential election ended in a violent attack on the U.S. Capitol by an angry mob that left five people dead and 140 injured. The vibes feel even darker this time, with the same two candidates describing one another as an existential threat to the nation.\n\nExperts in political extremism expected these combustible factors to finally ignite with a high-profile attack. \u201cIt\u2019s the manifestation of the political environment we\u2019re in,\u201d says Daryl Johnson, a former senior intelligence analyst who tracked domestic extremism at the Department of Homeland Security. \u201cAnd there\u2019s gonna be more.\u201d\n\nOfficers face off against rioters attempting to storm the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 Brent Stirton\u2014Getty Images\n\nThomas Matthew Crooks, the suspect identified as the assailant who shot at Trump, remained a puzzle to investigators in the days after the shooting. Unlike most 20-year-olds, he seems to have had no public digital presence. He had no previous criminal record or documented history of mental illness, and used no threatening language on his private social media accounts, according to FBI investigators. He was a registered Republican, according to Pennsylvania voter data, but Federal Election Commission records show he made a $15 donation to a progressive political action committee in 2021. It is not even clear that his purpose in firing shots at Trump\u2019s rally\u2014 which, in addition to wounding the former President, killed a rallygoer and seriously wounded two others\u2014was primarily political.\n\nCrooks was living with his parents, who are both licensed professional counselors, in a middle-class Pittsburgh suburb. Two years out of high school, he worked in the kitchen of a local nursing home. He used an AR-style semiautomatic rifle legally purchased by his father, according to local law enforcement. Investigators also found \u201crudimentary\u201d explosive devices and bombmaking material inside his car and home.\n\nIf the mystery surrounding Crooks\u2019 motive is unusual, his normal background is not. Most perpetrators of political violence are not people with a history of criminality. They are seemingly ordinary Americans, off the radar of the authorities, for whom the idea of taking violent action privately crystallizes. \u201cThey seem to just come out of the blue,\u201d says Johnson, the former Homeland Security analyst.\n\nWhat is clear, experts say, is that the political environment plays a role. Crooks grew up in a nation where high-profile attacks against elected officials have become increasingly common. He was 7 when Democratic Representative Gabby Giffords was shot while meeting with constituents in a supermarket parking lot in Tucson, Ariz., in 2011. He was 13 when Representative Steve Scalise was shot by a left-wing extremist during a GOP congressional baseball team practice in Virginia in 2017. When Crooks was 17, federal authorities foiled a plot to kidnap Michigan\u2019s Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer that was hatched by a right-wing militia group that posted violent antigovernment screeds. Crooks was a junior in high school when the country was rocked by the attack on the U.S. Capitol. As he graduated, the news was dominated by a disrupted plot to assassinate conservative Supreme Court Justices and an attack on former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s husband, whose skull was fractured by a conspiracy theorist wielding a hammer and zip ties and planning to kidnap the Democratic legislator.\n\n\u201cSince they were young adolescents, there has been a skyrocketing of political threats and political violence,\u201d says Rachel Kleinfeld, an analyst who focuses on polarization and violence at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u201cThat coarsening of political life, the normalization of incendiary and violent rhetoric, the sense that violence is a legitimate way to solve political problems,\u201d she says, adding that this is \u201cthe background noise to this generation\u2019s political rise.\u201d\n\nThreats against members of Congress are up nearly tenfold since 2015, with more than 8,000 reported last year, according to the U.S. Capitol Police. Serious threats against federal judges that trigger an investigation rose from 179 in 2019 to 457 in 2023. In a survey conducted earlier this year, more than 40% of state legislators reported being threatened or attacked during the past three years; nearly 90% said they had suffered other forms of abuse, including harassment, intimidation, and stalking. \u201cIt\u2019s not registering for Americans that the general tenor of political life has become one in which you can expect to be threatened,\u201d says Kleinfeld. Now, she says, \u201cthat is the cost of running for office.\u201d\n\nIn the past, experts say, ideology tended to be the main motivator for violent political attackers, from ecoterrorists to antiabortion extremists. The recent surge has been more partisan, tied to Americans\u2019 strong identification as Democrats or Republicans. Social media platforms and diffuse online communications have radicalized more people and made it easier for them to threaten political opponents or to target members of their own parties they see as traitors.\n\nLanguage plays a role too. Trump pledged to \u201croot out the communists, Marxists, fascists, and the radical-left thugs that live like vermin\u201d and warned that \u201cif I don\u2019t get elected, it\u2019s going to be a bloodbath for the whole country.\u201d During his presidential campaign, Joe Biden has condemned Trump\u2019s \u201cassault on democracy,\u201d telling supporters that their \u201cfreedom is on the ballot.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe state of American politics is so miserable, so ugly, that it\u2019s almost unrecognizable,\u201d says former Pennsylvania Republican Representative Charlie Dent, who is involved in the Keep Our Republic organization and was alarmed by the Nazareth focus group\u2019s anticipation of political violence. \u201cOne side says the elections are rigged, and we won\u2019t have a country if we don\u2019t win,\u201d Dent says. \u201cThe other side says democracy will cease to exist and the country will lapse into a fascist authoritarian society like The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. Both see the other as evil and illegitimate.\u201d Adds Dent: \u201cAt this rate, the country could experience civil disorder after the election regardless of the outcome.\u201d\n\nThe footage of the assassination attempt on Trump, against the backdrop of violent threats at every level of government, could radicalize even more Americans, security analysts fear. Each prominent act of political violence adds to a cycle of \u201ccontinued violent mobilization and countermobilization\u201d by far-right and far-left individuals and groups, who may use these events to radicalize and recruit more followers, according to a new report by Washington-based New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy. \u201cNeither likely outcome of the 2024 U.S. presidential election is expected to stem the heightened activity of domestic extremists, including those willing to use violence, for the next four years or more,\u201d analysts conclude in the July 10 report.\n\nIn their most recent threat assessment, DHS officials flagged domestic extremists motivated by partisan grievances or antigovernment conspiracies as a top national-security risk. Individuals or organized groups could target candidates, government officials, voters, and campaign events as well as election infrastructure such as polling places or ballot drops, analysts say. In contrast with much of the past two decades, when U.S. officials focused on larger terrorist groups, the highest threat now comes from self-radicalized Americans and \u201clone offenders,\u201d DHS concluded.\n\nJames Palka\u2014Getty Images; Andrew Harrer\u2014Bloomberg/Getty Images; Carline Jean\u2014South Florida Sun-Sentinel/AP; Jeff Kowalsky\u2014AFP/Getty Images; AP; Win McNamee\u2014Getty Images; San Francisco Police Department/AP; Gene J. Puskar\u2014AP\n\nTaking office after the Jan. 6 attack, the Biden Administration vowed to fight the \u201crising tide\u201d of domestic extremism. The U.S. government shifted resources from foreign terrorism to understanding homegrown radicalization and released a national strategy to address the problem. The plan included improved information sharing among law-enforcement agencies, investigating and understanding extremist ideologies, and preventing recruitment by these groups. The FBI distributed 40,000 booklets to partners on how to spot the signs of violent extremism.\n\nRead More: Inside the Biden Administration\u2019s Uphill Battle Against Far-Right Extremism\n\nWhile the Administration succeeded in dismantling some organized groups and militias, self-radicalized \u201clone wolf\u201d actors continue to be the major driver of political violence. They are able to engage \u201cin lethal attacks and acts of violence against targets of opportunity, using rudimentary tactics and readily accessible weapons,\u201d according to a 2021 FBI analysis. The normalization of apocalyptic and menacing language online has also made it difficult to gauge whether a threat is imminent. In one recent case, authorities found an extensive, chilling trail of threats posted by a failed candidate for the New Mexico state legislature only after he was charged with orchestrating a scheme to shoot at the homes of several elected Democratic officials.\n\nFar-right online communities, where talk of \u201ccivil war\u201d and armed retaliation has become commonplace since the 2020 election, were flooded with angry messages after the attempted assassination of Trump. Some said they were taking his exhortation to \u201cFight! Fight! Fight!\u201d literally. \u201cThey tried to kill my President,\u201d one person posted on a pro-Trump forum. \u201cI want revenge.\u201d The FBI says threats of political violence have spiked since the Pennsylvania shooting, with individuals online mimicking or posing as the shooter and spurring fears of copycats, according to Deputy Director Paul Abbate.\n\nRead More: Accused \u2018Mastermind\u2019 of New Mexico Political Shootings Left A Chilling Digital Trail\n\nIn the aftermath, Trump issued a rare call for unity. \u201cThis is a chance to bring the whole country, even the whole world, together,\u201d he said. But it\u2019s unclear how long the former President, whose campaigning leans heavily into incendiary speeches and often violent imagery, will stick to that subdued tone. It\u2019s also unclear if Biden, who condemned the attack and called on Americans to \u201ccool it down,\u201d will dial back his campaign\u2019s core theme that Trump represents an existential threat to American democracy.\n\nThere are already signs that a new tone from the top is unlikely. Republicans have blamed the shooting on Biden and his claim that Trump is a dangerous autocrat who needs to be stopped. Trump\u2019s running mate, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance, said the Biden campaign\u2019s messaging \u201cled directly to President Trump\u2019s attempted assassination.\u201d Both sides have trafficked in baseless conspiracy theories. Georgia Republican Representative Mike Collins tweeted, \u201cJoe Biden sent the orders.\u201d Some on the left suggest that the Trump campaign faked the shooting with the help of the Secret Service, and that the blood on Trump\u2019s ear came from gel capsules. Dmitri Mehlhorn, a Democratic fundraiser and strategist, sent an email questioning whether \u201cthis \u2018shooting\u2019 was encouraged and maybe even staged so Trump could get the photos and benefit from the backlash,\u201d calling it a \u201cclassic Russian tactic.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s possible for Americans to stop the cycle, experts say. \u201cAmericans could look in the mirror, be shocked by what they see, and stop normalizing the incendiary rhetoric and violence that is leading to these sorts of events,\u201d says Kleinfeld. Or, she says, \u201cthey will point fingers, as is already happening, and use the opportunity to try to score political points. And if they do, it will continue to get worse.\u201d\n\nMore from TIME",

        "text": "What happens next now that Biden has dropped out of the presidential race\nUS President Joe Biden steps off Air Force One as he arrives at Hagerstown Regional Airport in Hagerstown, Maryland, June 20, 2024, on his way to Camp David. Samuel Corum | AFP | Getty Images\n\nThis story was updated after President Joe Biden announced his decision to exit the presidential race on July 21. President Joe Biden announced Sunday that he would drop out of the presidential race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the candidate to replace him. The president's decision came as he isolated with Covid at his Delaware beach house. In the wake of his damaging debate against Donald Trump, Biden faced mounting pressure from Democrats \u2014 in private and in public \u2014 calling on him to step down. While he had initially rejected the calls to step aside, Biden said Tuesday that should a \"medical condition\" emerge, it could force him to rethink his decision to stay in the race. On Wednesday, Biden, 81, tested positive for Covid-19. His doctors say his symptoms are mild and that he is recovering steadily. Here is what happens next.\n\nDelegates\n\nAfter breezing through the primary virtually unopposed, Biden won almost all of his party's 4,000-plus delegates, who are selected in large part because of their loyalty and support for their chosen candidate. Since Biden ended his campaign before voting began, those delegates can cast their ballots for a new candidate. The delegates are set to vote for their presidential nominee in a virtual roll call in early August, before the Democratic National Convention. According to the DNC rules, if no candidate wins a majority on that first ballot, then the more than 700 \"superdelegates\" can join in subsequent votes. The voting would then continue until one candidate won a simple majority of delegates.\n\nThe likeliest alternative\n\nBiden's endorsement of Harris bolsters the view of many pundits and experts who see her as the likeliest choice to replace him. \"The vice president is the logical choice, obviously,\" said Meena Bose, director of the Peter S. Kalikow Center for the Study of the American Presidency at Hofstra University, in an interview. Bose noted that Harris, 59, has already been vetted, when she joined Biden's campaign in 2020. What's more, the fundraising war chest that the Biden campaign has amassed in the current election cycle would transfer to her if she took over the ticket. Harris, like Biden, has struggled with low approval ratings throughout the last four years. And Republicans are already deploying attacks against her, accusing her of failing in her job as the administration's \"border czar\" \u2014 even though she was not given that task. Other high-profile Democrats, such as California Gov. Gavin Newsom or Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, have been floated as potentially stronger alternatives to Harris if Biden were no longer in the race. But almost all of those figures have already said they would not run for president in 2024. There is also a risk that leap-frogging the vice president in favor of another candidate could spark a bitterly contested party convention, something Democrats surely want to avoid \u2014 especially after the Republican convention's display of near-total unity behind Trump this week.",

        "text": "How Latino voters view the 2024 presidential election\n(Jeff Greenberg/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)\n\nFrom 2016 to 2024, the number of Latinos eligible to vote grew from 27 million to a projected 36 million.\n\nWhile Latino voters have favored Democratic candidates in presidential elections for many decades, the margin of support has varied. In 2020, 61% of Latino voters cast their ballot for Joe Biden, while 36% voted for Donald Trump, a narrower margin than in 2016 between Hillary Clinton and Trump.\n\nHow we did this Pew Research Center conducted this analysis to understand U.S. Hispanics\u2019 views of the 2024 presidential election campaign. For this analysis, we surveyed 9,424 adults \u2013 including 670 Hispanic registered voters \u2013 from July 1 to 7, 2024. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), a group of people recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses who have agreed to take surveys regularly. This kind of recruitment gives nearly all U.S. adults a chance of selection. Surveys were conducted either online or by telephone with a live interviewer. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other factors. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology. Here are the questions used for this analysis, the topline and the survey methodology.\n\nHere are key facts about how Latino registered voters view the presidential candidates and major issues ahead of the 2024 election, based on a Pew Research Center survey. The July 1-7 survey was conducted after President Biden\u2019s poor performance in the June 27 debate and before Trump was injured and a spectator killed in a shooting at a campaign rally on July 13.\n\nEqual shares of Latino registered voters say they would vote for Biden and Trump in the 2024 election. Roughly a third of Latino voters (36%) say they would vote for or lean toward each of the candidates if the election were held today.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2013 a third-party candidate \u2013 gets the support of 24% of Latino registered voters. Support for Kennedy is higher among Latinos than among U.S. voters overall (15%).\n\nRelated: Third-party and independent candidates for president often fall short of early polling numbers\n\nNeither Biden nor Trump has the confidence of most Latino voters on several issues.\n\nThe state of the U.S. economy and inflation have been top issues for Latino voters in 2024.\n\nAbout half of Latino voters (52%) say they have confidence that Trump will make good decisions about economic policy.\n\nBy comparison, four-in-ten say they have confidence in Biden in this area. Trump also has a slim edge over Biden on foreign policy.\n\nMeanwhile, 49% of Latino voters say they have confidence in Biden to select good Supreme Court nominees, compared with 42% who say the same about Trump.\n\nWhen it comes to making good decisions about abortion policy, 50% of Latino voters express confidence in Biden, while 45% have confidence in Trump.\n\nAnd on immigration, 39% have confidence in Biden, while 45% have confidence in Trump.\n\nRelatively few Latino voters would describe Trump as honest and Biden as mentally sharp. Roughly half of Latino voters (55%) say \u201chonest\u201d describes Biden very or fairly well, while 30% say the same about Trump.\n\nAnd just a quarter of Latino voters say they would describe Biden as \u201cmentally sharp,\u201d while nearly twice as many (49%) describe Trump this way.\n\nLatino voters continue to have a more favorable opinion of the Democratic Party than the Republican Party. However, neither party is viewed favorably by a majority of Latino voters (or of the public overall).\n\nSome 44% of Latino registered voters have a very or mostly favorable opinion of the Democratic Party, while 32% say the same about the GOP.\n\nViews of the Democratic Party also vary among Latino voters based on certain demographic characteristics:\n\nWomen are more likely than men to say they have a favorable opinion of the Democratic Party (50% vs. 40%).\n\nLatino voters ages 50 and older are somewhat more likely than their younger counterparts to say they have a favorable view of the Democratic Party (48% vs. 42%).\n\nHalf of Latino registered voters say the Democratic Party cares at least somewhat about people like them. Four-in-ten have the same view of the Republican Party.\n\nSimilarly, when Latinos are asked how hard each party works to earn the vote of people like them, roughly half of Latino voters say the Democratic Party works at least somewhat hard (54%) compared with 47% who say this about the GOP.\n\nNote: Here are the questions used for this analysis, the topline and the survey methodology.",

Here are 5 ways to take care of your mental health\n\ntoggle caption Elijah Nouvelage/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe presidential election is taking a toll on the mental health of Americans. And that's according to recent surveys conducted before the attempt on one candidate's life and widespread calls for another to drop out of the race.\n\nIn a poll by the American Psychiatric Association, nearly three-quarters (73%) of respondents said they're feeling anxious about the election. Another poll by Myriad Genetics found that nearly 40% said they are feeling anxious and/or depressed about the election season, and a similar share said they are \"checked out\" by the amount of news and social media attention on politics and the upcoming election.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nPsychologists say it's normal for people to feel heightened negative emotions during this time.\n\n\"There's a range of emotions that people experience during this time leading up to elections that can go from fear to anger to feeling stressed out to feeling extremely sad and fearful of the future,\" says psychologist Krystal Lewis at the National Institute of Mental Health. \"Those emotions are all valid, and it's OK to feel those emotions.\"\n\nAnd it's important to pay attention to those feelings, especially stress, says psychologist Lynn Bufka, deputy chief of professional practice at the American Psychological Association.\n\n\"It's probably telling us to pay attention to some extent to what's happening in the world so that we can be prepared to act in ways that are consistent with our beliefs and our values,\" she says.\n\nLewis says it's a good idea to channel that stress and anxiety into ways we can make a difference. That might involve getting more information on specific candidates and the policies they support. Here, she emphasizes not to lean on what someone else thinks or says but to rely on \"factual or validated news sources and websites.\"\n\n\"Figure out ways to use your voice,\" she says. \"Use that energy to either volunteer with organizations or share some information with other people, and essentially [exercise] your right to vote.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThat said, it's also important to pay attention to whether these feelings of stress and anxiety are overwhelming or getting in the way of daily life.\n\n\"When the stress becomes intense or long lasting and maybe symptoms develop such as prolonged sadness, worry, hopelessness, physical tensions or signs of anxiety and stress in the body, then that might be a point of intervention,\" says Lewis.\n\nIn other words, if your feelings are very overwhelming and persist for a long time, seek mental health care. And if you are feeling any of those symptoms, it's important to find ways to manage them.\n\nPeople with preexisting anxiety and depression might be more likely to experience these symptoms at a time of societal uncertainty and upheaval, she adds.\n\nFor those looking to get a handle on their stress and anxiety right now, here are some strategies from Lewis and Bufka.\n\n1. The first thing to do is understand what's fueling your symptoms \u2014 it's the uncertainty.\n\n\"Uncertainty is a breeding ground for anxiety and fear,\" says Lewis.\n\n\"We'd like to know what's going to happen,\" adds Bufka. \"We'd like to predict. So when uncertainty strikes, many people start to imagine worst-case scenarios.\" And that's not helpful, she says. \"An important strategy there is to try to break that habit, not go to the what's-the-worst-thing-that's-going-to-happen and anticipate everything will fall apart if X happens or Y happens.\"\n\nInstead, she suggests asking ourselves questions like: \"How likely is that worst-case scenario? Can I manage to cope with that? What are the kinds of things that I might again have some control over to try to manage a situation that would look like that?\"\n\nThose specific questions and one's responses to them can help people get a sense of control. \"Focusing on what we can control is a great way to help us manage our stress and anxiety,\" says Bufka.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n2. Another way to exercise control is to limit how much news one consumes.\n\nKnow when to step away or take a break, suggests Lewis. \"What that might look like is turning off the television, news outlets, wherever you're receiving your news,\" she says.\n\nThat includes social media. \"We don't have to scroll through social media just because it's handy and it's in front of us because we have smartphones in our pockets,\" says Bufka.\n\n3. Do things that are meaningful to you.\n\nThat could involve connecting with other people on issues you care about and working toward a cause, says Bufka. Or it might involve \"making sure that your older parents have a good meal tonight because they don't feel up to cooking themselves,\" she says, \"or picking up the trash in your neighborhood just to make it a better place.\"\n\nResearch shows that engaging in activities that are meaningful improves people's overall well-being, says Bufka, particularly during times of stress.\n\n4. Find other healthy ways to cope.\n\nThat includes doing things that bring you joy and keep you in the present moment, says Lewis, instead of worrying about what may or may not happen in the future.\n\n\"So this might be for individuals who like to be outside, [spend] time in nature, doing fun things with your family, finding joy in your daily activities.\"\n\nAnd don't forget to move your body, notes Bufka. \"We have extra energy in our bodies when we're stressed and overwhelmed, and being active allows us to release that stress,\" she says. \"Whether it's going on a walk, whether it's pulling weeds in the garden, whether it's playing soccer with your friends, playing tag with the kids \u2014 any of those things can help us release some of that physical energy and feel a little more present.\"\n\n5. Stay socially connected.\n\nAs multiple studies have shown, social isolation is bad for our mental and physical health. And it is particularly harmful if our mental health is already feeling frayed. \"Staying socially connected with friends, family, peers that help support us and give us someone to turn to when we're feeling overwhelmed \u2014 that makes a big difference in how we handle our stress,\" notes Bufka.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut, she cautions, \"we do have to be careful to not turn into stress spirals with other people.\"\n\nAnd make sure not to isolate yourself from people who have different political views from you, she adds.\n\n\"We don't have to dive into political conversations with everybody that we meet,\" she says, \"but connecting with people who might actually have different points of view than us [and] seeing our shared humanity can help us to lower the temperature about what our feared outcomes are.\"",

        "text": "Deep Dive: Immigration, Asylum, and the U.S. Election\nDeep Dive: Immigration, Asylum, and the U.S. Election\n\nAn interview is conducted at a job fair for refugees and asylum seekers at The New School's Arnhold Hall on June 29, 2024 in New York City. (Andres Kudacki/Getty Images)\n\nWe\u2019re pleased to introduce Deep Dive, a new article series on hias.org that explores, in detail, a specific issue relevant to HIAS\u2019 work. In this first edition, we lay out five key facts about one of the most important issues informing the upcoming U.S. presidential election: immigration, refugees, and asylum. Few issues loom larger for the upcoming presidential election in the United States than immigration. During the Republican National Convention, a parade of speakers spoke about undocumented immigrants, asylum seekers, and refugees in near-apocalyptic terms. Democrats, too, have touted their \u201ctoughness\u201d on immigration, while the Biden administration has enacted historically stringent measures to curb asylum. This change reflects a public souring toward immigration: Gallup recently reported that 55% of Americans want immigration levels reduced \u2014 the highest figure since 2001. Since our founding more than a century ago, HIAS has provided essential services to refugees, asylum seekers, and other displaced and stateless people around the world. In order to frame the U.S. immigration debate in truth \u2014 rather than misinformation, propaganda, and innuendo \u2014 below are five relevant facts you should know. Fact One: Seeking Asylum is Legal. The United States government defines asylum as a form of protection granted to foreign nationals or stateless individuals who face, or are at risk of facing, persecution on account of their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or association with a particular political opinion. Asylum rights became enshrined into international law following the Second World War and were codified in U.S. law in 1980. People have a right to claim asylum in the U.S. regardless of how they entered the country. In the past decade, asylum rights have come under sustained threat. But it remains legal in the United States \u2014 and a crucial right to protect.\n\nRelated News Asylum Backlog Presents Anguish, Uncertainty for Seekers\n\nFact Two: Asylum Is Not Easy to Obtain. Immigration opponents have portrayed the United States asylum system as a free-for-all, where every individual who approaches the border claims asylum and then enters the country freely. In fact, the asylum process is complex, tricky, and, for many applicants, one that does not result in acceptance. Asylum claims filed in immigration court face steep odds, especially for claimants \u2014 some 70% of the total number \u2014 who do not have legal representation. But even those who do obtain the services of an attorney enter a system with a daunting backlog. Moreover, there has been an onslaught of recent changes at the U.S.-Mexico border that prevent people from accessing the asylum system in the first place. Recent policies require people to wait in Mexico while trying to access appointments via a cellphone app, deny due process in initial screening interviews, speed up deportations at the border, increase the usage of immigration detention, and simply deny entry to asylum seekers altogether. All these factors contribute to the approval rate for asylum seekers remaining low. In 2021, only 37% of asylum applications were granted.\n\nAsylum claims filed in immigration court face steep odds, especially for claimants \u2014 some 70% of the total number \u2014 who do not have legal representation.\n\nFact Three: Asylum Seekers and Refugees Help the Economy. A common claim made by anti-immigrant politicians is that asylum seekers and refugees are a drain on the economy, namely by competing with native-born Americans for jobs and driving wages down. In fact, the opposite is true: A recent study from the Department of Health and Human Services found that between 2005 and 2019, asylees and refugees contributed a net $124 billion to the U.S. economy \u2013 more than the GDP of the Dominican Republic. Refugees and asylum seekers are almost 50% more likely than the general U.S. population to become entrepreneurs, despite facing obstacles \u2014 like easy access to credit \u2014 that American-born entrepreneurs take for granted. Earlier this year, HIAS launched the Economic Advancement Fund (EAF), a Community Development Financial Institution designed to provide resources to refugee entrepreneurs in the U.S. Fact Four: Asylum Seekers and Immigrants Commit Fewer Crimes, Per Capita, Than Average. One of the most consistent lines of rhetoric from anti-immigrant politicians is that refugee and asylum seekers are directly responsible for an increase in crime. At the Republican National Convention, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) said that \u201cevery day Americans are dying \u2014 murdered, assaulted, raped by illegal immigrants that the Democrats have released.\u201d The facts do not back up this insinuation. A 2020 study found that in Cruz\u2019 own Texas, a state that records the immigration status of everyone who is arrested, undocumented immigrants are significantly less likely to commit crimes.\n\nA 2020 study found that Texas, undocumented immigrants are significantly less likely to commit crimes.\n\nFact Five: Our Asylum System Is Broken. But That Doesn\u2019t Mean It Can\u2019t Be Fixed. Immigration opponents often argue that measures to prevent people from entering, and to curtail access to asylum \u2014 such as construction of a border wall, or Title 42-style suspensions \u2014 are the only solution for tackling the rise of encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border. This is a false choice. People who are fleeing danger will not stop trying to save the lives of themselves and their families. Draconian policies do not stop people from coming \u2014 they only increase a volatile and chaotic environment that denies the rights of asylum seekers and does nothing to provide security at the border. Real solutions are possible, but there must be political will to achieve them. The present situation along the border occurred due to multiple factors, not least that Congress has failed to pass significant immigration reform since 1996. More resources are also needed on the local level. In cities across the U.S., HIAS has seen an outpouring of welcome for newcomers seeking safety \u2014 but these communities can\u2019t do it alone.

        "text": "Election Highlights: Biden Maintains Public Defiance as More Lawmakers Call for His Exit From Race\nRepublicans viewed President Biden as an easy target even before the renewed questions over his age and mental acuity stemming from his disastrous June debate performance.\n\nAs Sam Brown, a Republican and Army veteran, has campaigned for Nevada\u2019s U.S. Senate seat against Senator Jacky Rosen, he has deployed a potent weapon against his Democratic foe: the unpopularity of President Biden among the state\u2019s voters.\n\nMr. Brown and his campaign have linked Ms. Rosen to Mr. Biden and his policies at every turn, slamming her support for him on the campaign trail and online and even occasionally referring to her as \u201cJacky Biden.\u201d\n\nNow, with Mr. Biden\u2019s future at the top of the Democratic ticket in doubt, Republicans like Mr. Brown, campaigning in competitive down-ballot races that could decide control of Congress, are considering whether they will need to alter their messaging to account for a different Democratic presidential nominee \u2014 whether that is Vice President Kamala Harris or another challenger.\n\n\u201cIt certainly changes things; changing a potential presidential candidate for November, that\u2019s going to do something,\u201d Mr. Brown said in an interview. \u201cBut at the end of the day, Jacky Rosen has her own record that she has to answer to.\u201d\n\nImage President Biden has given no public indication that he plans to bow to the rising pressure from within his party to step aside. Credit... Eric Lee/The New York Times\n\nRepublicans viewed Mr. Biden as an easy target even before the renewed questions over his age and mental acuity stemming from his disastrous June debate performance. Many voters already viewed him as too old for a second term, and Republicans bashed him for his handling of the border and tried tying him to soaring inflation and gas prices.\n\nThe slate of Republicans challenging Democratic senators delighted in repeating a particular statistic: the percentage of the time, often close to 100, that their opponent voted for Mr. Biden\u2019s legislative priorities.\n\nStill, asked directly whom they would prefer to be at the top of the Democratic ticket as they run in down-ballot races, G.O.P. candidates at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee demurred. They said it did not matter to them because they could simply saddle Ms. Harris or another candidate with Mr. Biden\u2019s baggage, and focus more narrowly on the pertinent issues in their particular race, or on the Democratic platform as a whole.\n\nBut they offered a host of reasons for why Mr. Biden felt like a prime target, and some acknowledged they would need to readjust their strategy if a different candidate took the reins.\n\nRepresentative Carlos Gim\u00e9nez, a Florida Republican, said it did not matter to him \u201cwho\u2019s on the top of the ticket,\u201d but added that Republicans would lose some particularly fertile lines of argument against Mr. Biden.\n\n\u201cWith Biden, it\u2019s the argument that not only his policies are bad, but he\u2019s also incapable of being the president of the United States,\u201d Mr. Gim\u00e9nez said. \u201cHarris, she still has full capacity. Her policies still are bad for the United States, but you can\u2019t make that other argument. So that changes somewhat.\u201d\n\nThe Biden campaign said Mr. Biden had provided down-ballot Democrats with \u201can incredible agenda to run on.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis election, whether it\u2019s top of ticket or a state election, will be decided on the issues that matter most to voters, which is why Democrats will win this November,\u201d said Sarafina Chitika, a Biden campaign spokeswoman.\n\nMr. Biden has given no public indication that he plans to bow to the rising pressure from within his party to step aside, and on Friday he said in a statement that he planned to get \u201cback on the campaign trail next week.\u201d But if he does, his withdrawal could reverberate in key races for the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, where some Democrats fear he has become a drag on their candidates.\n\nThe campaign of former President Donald J. Trump and its allies are among those who have relished facing Mr. Biden. This week, they ramped up efforts to criticize Democrats who hope for a different nominee, a tacit acknowledgment that Mr. Biden could be an easier opponent than alternatives.\n\nChris LaCivita, a top adviser to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, said that Democratic turmoil over selecting a new nominee was betraying the democratic process and the Biden campaign\u2019s framing of the 2024 election as a battle over democracy.\n\n\u201cThey all want to talk about this notion of the war against democracy,\u201d but it was Democrats who were fomenting \u201ca coup,\u201d Mr. LaCivita said at an event in Milwaukee on Thursday. He added that if they force the president to drop out, Democrats would be \u201cdisenfranchising\u201d the 14 million people who voted in their primaries.\n\nImage \u201cI think we will win in November. But I want every Republican to understand we\u2019ve got a serious fight,\u201d said Senator Ted Cruz of Texas about the potential Democratic nominee. Credit... Maddie McGarvey for The New York Times\n\nOn the convention floor on Thursday, Senator Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican, told the conservative network One America News that he thought the Democratic nominee would be either Ms. Harris or Michelle Obama, the wife of former President Barack Obama, who has said repeatedly that she is not interested in running for office.\n\n\u201cBoth of them, I think it\u2019s going to be a real challenge and a real fight,\u201d said Mr. Cruz, who is running against Representative Colin Allred, a Dallas-area Democrat. \u201cI think we will win in November. But I want every Republican to understand we\u2019ve got a serious fight.\u201d\n\nIn Ms. Harris, who performs better than Mr. Biden in some polls but not all, Republicans see an avatar of Mr. Biden and his policies. They view her as particularly vulnerable to attacks on immigration, because Mr. Biden tapped her to assist with the diplomatic mission of solving the \u201croot causes\u201d of migration from Central American countries.\n\nRepublicans took control of the House in 2022 in part by mobilizing voters in the New York suburbs and taking control of districts that Mr. Biden had won by more than 10 percentage points two years earlier. Vulnerable Republicans in those districts would face considerable re-election challenges if Mr. Biden or Ms. Harris drove turnout in those areas, but some projected confidence that the vice president would not pose a significant threat.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same race either way you look at it, whether you\u2019re talking about Joe Biden or you\u2019re talking about Kamala Harris \u2014 it\u2019s the same bad policies, it\u2019s the same bad decisions, it\u2019s the same liabilities,\u201d said Representative Anthony D\u2019Esposito, a New York Republican locked in a tight re-election battle on Long Island. \u201cKamala Harris is Joe Biden, and Joe Biden is Kamala Harris.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Mike Lawler, a first-term New York Republican who won his seat by fewer than 2,000 votes in 2022, said it made no difference if Mr. Biden dropped out or stayed in the race, arguing that Republicans were running against the Democratic platform, rather than the top of their ticket \u2014 even if attacks against his Democratic opponent, Mondaire Jones, have highlighted Mr. Jones\u2019s relationship with Mr. Biden.\n\nStill, some admitted that they did not want to see Mr. Biden and his troubles walk out the door.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see him stay in the race,\u201d said Senator Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota. \u201cPeople will punish the Democratic Party if he is the nominee.\u201d\n\nNatasha Halbfinger contributed reporting.",

One senior party official told the BBC that many in the party felt Mr Biden's stepping down was \"inevitable\".\n\nJoe Biden's campaign faced further pressure on Thursday amid reported concerns from Barack Obama about the presidential election, a darkening mood among Democrats and polls suggesting Donald Trump was pulling ahead.\n\nCan Biden be replaced as nominee? Not so easily\n\nMr Obama was reported by the Washington Post to have privately stated Mr Biden's chances were greatly diminished. Spokespeople for the former president have declined to comment.\n\nThe most recent lawmaker to pull support from Biden's run is Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown. On Friday, the Democrat released a statement saying it is his ''job to keep fighting'' for his constituents.\n\n\u201cI agree with the many Ohioans who have reached out to me. At this critical time, our full attention must return to these important issues. I think the President should end his campaign,\" he said.\n\nIt followed several reports that former house speaker Nancy Pelosi and the two most senior Democrats in Congress, Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer, had advised Mr Biden to consider his candidacy for the good of the party. All have rejected the reports.\n\nBut a senior Democrat source told BBC News that the mood in Washington was grim, adding: \"We are all waiting for the inevitable decision.\"\n\nAdam Smith, a Democratic congressman for Washington state, painted a similarly grim picture. Asked by BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight whether the party was \"coming to the end\" of Mr Biden's candidacy, he said: \"That is my sense\".\n\n\"I mean, I don\u2019t know. But without question, I think that is the direction that this is heading right now.\"\n\nMr Biden has faced a torrid few weeks since his poor showing in the first presidential debate late last month. He is currently in isolation in Delaware while he recovers from a Covid infection.\n\nBy contrast, Donald Trump officially accepted his party's presidential nomination at the Republican national convention in Milwaukee on Thursday evening.\n\nHe struck a confident tone in his first speech since surviving an assassination attempt. Delegates and supporters at the convention have been in high spirits all week.\n\nMr Biden has so far taken a defiant tone in response to Democratic pressure for him to step aside as his party's candidate. He continues to enjoy the public support of many politicians, including members of the powerful Congressional black caucus.\n\nMr Schumer, the Senate Majority Leader and Mr Jeffries, the ranking Democrat in the House of Representatives, are reported to have told Mr Biden last week that their colleagues in Congress were \"concerned\" that his troubles would hit their own chances of re-election.\n\nMr Schumer said the reports were \"idle speculation\", while Mr Jeffries said his was \"a private conversation that will remain private\".\n\nCNN meanwhile reported that Mrs Pelosi had told Mr Biden that polls show he cannot win. She later slammed the reporting as a \"feeding frenzy\", but did not deny that a conversation with Mr Biden had taken place.\n\nJamie Raskin, a congressman from Maryland, wrote to Mr Biden, comparing him to a baseball pitcher at the end of his career - saying there was \"no shame\" in retiring \"to the overflowing appreciation of the crowd when your arm is tired out\".\n\nBut TJ Ducklo, a Biden campaign senior adviser, slammed reports of grandee concern as \"baseless conjecture from anonymous sources\".\n\n\"Joe Biden is his party's nominee,\" he wrote on X. \"He's running for re-election.\"\n\nDeputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks said Mr Biden was \"not wavering on anything. The president has made his decision. I don't want to be rude, but I don\u2019t know how many more times we can answer that.\"\n\nMr Biden has mild upper respiratory symptoms associated with Covid but does not have a fever, presidential doctor Kevin O'Connor said on Thursday,\n\nThe White House said he was expected to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after he arrives in the US on Wednesday.",

        "text": "Why did Republican Donald Trump choose JD Vance as his vice president?\nExperts say Vance will likely not persuade swing-state voters, but he will energise Trump\u2019s far-right base of support.\n\nThe question had lingered over Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign for months: Who will the Republican pick as his running mate as he pursues a second term in the White House?\n\nOn Monday, his choice was revealed: JD Vance, an author, venture capitalist and pugnacious first-term senator from Ohio.\n\nExperts say the decision marked a shift in strategy for Trump. While Trump\u2019s previous running mate, Mike Pence, was seen as a moderating influence in his campaign, his new selection signals an embrace of hard-right \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d politics \u2014 and a break from the old-school Republican establishment.\n\nOn Wednesday, Vance himself made the argument for a more brazen future for the Republican Party, as he gave a nominating speech at the Republican National Convention.\n\n\u201cTonight is a night of hope, of what America once was and \u2014 with God\u2019s grace \u2014 what it will soon be again. And it is a reminder of the sacred duty we have to preserve the American experiment, to choose a new path for our children and grandchildren,\u201d Vance said.\n\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t we be governed by a party that is unafraid to debate ideas and come to the best solution? That\u2019s the Republican Party of the next four years.\u201d\n\nAllan Lichtman, a professor of US history at American University, told Al Jazeera that Vance will likely not appeal to swing-state voters or those sceptical of Trump\u2019s brand of politics.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the pick of JD Vance one way or another is going to affect the outcome of this election. But it says a lot about the Republican Party and Donald Trump,\u201d Lichtman said.\n\nHe pointed out that Trump could have courted middle-ground voters by choosing someone akin to Nikki Haley, his rival in the Republican primaries.\n\n\u201cTrump didn\u2019t reach out to the small but not insignificant faction of his party that supported Nikki Haley, who has a different approach to foreign policy and a more moderate approach to domestic policy,\u201d Lichtman explained. \u201cInstead, he picked a younger clone of himself.\u201d\n\nThe zeal of a convert\n\nVance was not always so closely aligned with Trump. In the past, Vance described himself as a \u201cNever Trump guy\u201d and even called the former president \u201creprehensible\u201d and \u201can idiot\u201d.\n\nIn a 2016 screenshot widely shared on social media, Vance even told a friend he could not decide whether Trump was a \u201ccynical a**hole\u201d or \u201cAmerica\u2019s Hitler\u201d.\n\nBut when Vance ran for his Senate seat in 2022, his tone switched: He leaned into Trump\u2019s style of politics, repeating false claims that the 2020 election had been stolen through massive fraud.\n\nUltimately, he won the former president\u2019s endorsement, a widely coveted stamp of approval among Republican political hopefuls.\n\nMedia reports indicate Trump himself was impressed with Vance\u2019s public persona \u2014 and his willingness to defend the ex-president in his regular media appearances.\n\nEven after Vance won his Senate seat, he continued to praise Trump and attack his critics.\n\nTrump-endorsed candidates performed poorly overall in the 2022 midterm races, and some in the Republican Party openly questioned whether Trump was an electoral liability. Vance, however, doubled down on his support, penning articles with titles like \u201cDon\u2019t Blame Trump\u201d.\n\nNevertheless, Lichtman said Vance\u2019s background as a Trump critic could still serve as a double-edged sword.\n\n\u201cObviously Trump is going to say, \u2018My policies and my leadership have been so great when I was president that I\u2019ve converted my strongest critics, including JD Vance,\u2019\u201d Lichtman explained.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, you might see Democrats, in commercials and debates, repeat the horrible things JD Vance has said about Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nAn appeal to the working poor\n\nJust as Trump\u2019s presidential run in 2016 prompted questions about the future of the Republican Party, Vance\u2019s place on the 2024 ticket has sparked debate about whether conservatives are moving away from previous longstanding positions.\n\nVance is the author of the 2016 memoir Hillbilly Elegy, which traces his experiences growing up in Ohio with a family from rural Kentucky. The book revolves around themes of social and economic alienation among the working poor.\n\nWhile old-school Republicans have long expressed support for free trade and corporate deregulation, Vance himself has railed against the free-trade deals that led to the decline of industry in areas like the Rust Belt, where Ohio is located.\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s Democratic rival, Joe Biden, is likewise from the Rust Belt town of Scranton, Pennsylvania, Vance has said Trump\u2019s values better align with the region.\n\n\u201cThe guy who actually connects with working people in this country is not fake Scranton Joe. It\u2019s real President Donald Trump,\u201d Vance said in recent remarks to party donors.\n\nHe revisited his Rust Belt upbringing in his speech on Wednesday night, saying: \u201cWe\u2019re done, ladies and gentlemen, catering to Wall Street. We\u2019ll commit to the working man.\u201d\n\nStill, Vance\u2019s critics question his working-class bona fides: The vice presidential nominee attended Yale Law School and has close ties to right-wing billionaires from his time in the tech sector.\n\nThey also point out that, during his time in the Senate, Vance was reluctant to sign on to pro-labour legislation.\n\nA new direction on foreign policy?\n\nVance has also shown a willingness to break with party orthodoxy in foreign policy, moving away from full-throated support for US military action overseas.\n\nTrump himself has expressed similar sentiments, pushing an \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy.\n\nThose schisms over foreign policy were on display during the Republican Party primary, with candidates like Haley staking out more traditional positions, in favour of international alliances like NATO and military assistance for countries like Ukraine.\n\nFor his part, Vance has been hawkish in his opposition to China and support for Israel. He has also advocated using the US military to target drug trafficking in Mexico. But when it comes to Ukraine, which has been fending off a full-scale Russian invasion since 2022, he was less enthusiastic.\n\n\u201cI do not think that it is in America\u2019s interest to continue to fund an effectively never-ending war in Ukraine,\u201d he said in May.\n\nBut David Klion, an author working on a book about neoconservatives, said events such as the Iraq War helped create the current trend.\n\nRecent US-led wars in the Middle East have been a source of discontent with previous Republican leaders like George W Bush.\n\nKlion explained that those conflicts have led many in the party to grow increasingly wary of US commitments overseas.\n\n\u201cThe discrediting of this more traditional type of conservatism is rooted in the catastrophes of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars,\u201d Klion told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cThe Vance selection is an ideological statement. When Trump picked Mike Pence to be his vice president in 2016, it was a pick meant to reassure those in the party who were spooked by Trump that he wouldn\u2019t stray too far from the party\u2019s norms on issues like trade and foreign policy,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cVance is clearly meant to signify that the right, as it has developed in the wake of Trump\u2019s election, is the direction Trump wants to lead the party.\u201d",

Former President Barack Obama Senate Majority leader Chunk Schumer and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are working behind the scenes to convince Biden to end his electoral campaign.It has now emerged that over the weekend, while Schumer made a concerted effort to convince Biden, Nancy Pelosi too had presented her case, asking him to step aside. As a senior member of the party, she is concerned about the future of the party if Biden were to lose the election in November.It has been reported that Nancy Pelosi tried her best to convince Biden to step down. Firstly, she told him in no uncertain terms that various national surveys indicate that his adversary Trump is about to unseat him in November and secure a second term. During the conversation it was pointed to Biden that Trump is ahead of him in all the surveys. Apparently, Biden dismissed these surveys and pointed out that his own team surveys indicated that he was winning the upcoming presidential election in November.Pelosi also told him that it is critical for the party to win the election in November for it to secure a majority in the House of Representatives . Biden is reported to have been on the defensive.It is unknown if Pelosi asked Biden to step down in absolute terms. It needs to be answered if she asked him in no uncertain terms to step down. Earlier, Pelosi and Obama shared concerns pertaining to Biden\u2019s age and health in private.Three top leaders have called on Joe Biden to end his electoral campaign. Obama, Schumer and Pelosi have called on Biden to step down. Further, 21 other members of the US Congress have called on him to step down. There are concerns pertaining to his health and his old age.While in public, the two share a good relationship, news reports indicate the very opposite. Biden was Obama\u2019s running mate and served as the Vice President earlier. He was expecting Obama\u2019s support in the US Presidential Election 2016 but Obama supported his Secretary of State Hilary Clinton. Biden has been disappointed ever since.It has emerged that he had been convincing his former deputy to step aside. There is no information on what Obama has been speaking to Biden, on.",

        "text": "Trump Promises to Militarize Police, Reincarcerate Thousands, and Expand Death Penalty\nOur analysis of a potential second Trump administration's proposed criminal legal system policies include unlawful tactics that will only harm our communities.\n\nThis piece was published before Joe Biden withdrew from the 2024 presidential election and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to represent the Democratic Party. No significant facts have been changed or added. Donald Trump has long identified himself as the candidate of \u201claw and order\u201d but, during the Trump administration, \u201claw and order\u201d translated to a severe approach to criminal punishment and policing that failed to make us safer. Today, his proposed policies for a second term promise to double down on these ineffective tough on crime tactics. If reelected, a second administration threatens to accelerate mass incarceration and roll back decades of progress by encouraging aggressive policing practices, enacting draconian sentencing regimes, and expanding the use of the death penalty. At the ACLU, we won\u2019t let our country go backward. If Trump returns to office, we\u2019re prepared to meet these unconstitutional policies with the same fierce response as we did during the last Trump administration. Learn more about our roadmap in our breakdown.\n\nTrump on the Criminal Legal System\n\nThe Facts: According to Trump\u2019s campaign, \u201cthere is no higher priority than quickly restoring law and order and public safety in America.\u201d But, just as it was during President Richard Nixon\u2019s 1968 campaign against the war on drugs, \u201claw and order\u201d under a second Trump administration is a \u201cshorthand message promising repression of the Black community.\u201d Specifically, Trump\u2019s law enforcement policies call for further protections for abusive police, including condoning the use of force against protesters, which he once described as a \u201cbeautiful thing to watch.\u201d This rhetoric risks encouraging state actors to take a similarly brutal approach. Beyond rhetoric, however, Trump is also likely to immediately rescind President Joe Biden\u2019s 2022 executive order on policing. Doing so would eviscerate one of the most substantial federal actions on police reform since George Floyd\u2019s murder and roll back important changes to use of force standards, including restrictions on chokeholds and carotid restraints. These expected policies will have an outsized impact on marginalized communities, especially the Black community, which is far more likely to experience police abuse. We also know that a second Trump administration intends to deputize local law enforcement to aid an unprecedented mass deportation effort that would decimate communities. Additionally, Trump has promised that, if reelected, his administration will accelerate mass incarceration efforts by directing federal prosecutors to seek the most serious charges and maximum sentences, pressuring local prosecutors to take a similarly draconian approach, and re-incarcerating thousands of people on home confinement. His administration will also expand the use of the death penalty \u2013 despite Americans\u2019 increasing opposition to capital punishment \u2013 by broadening the category of crimes punishable by death, sentencing more people to die, and killing every person on federal death row. While Trump will have a singular impact on the federal system, ultimately, state and local governments control most of the substantive parts of state criminal legal systems, including policing, prosecution, sentencing, and conditions in prisons and jails. Today, there are over 1.6 million people in state and local jails and prisons, compared to just over 200,000 in federal jails and prisons. But even without direct control of state systems, Trump will play an important role in setting the tone for state policies and many of his plans will have a ripple effect across the country. Why It Matters: The Trump administration has already shown its capacity for brutal criminal legal system policies. In its final year, for example, the Trump Administration executed 13 people, more than half of whom were people of color. Trump executed more people than any administration in 120 years. Trump\u2019s embrace of capital punishment is longstanding. In the 1980s, as a private citizen, he paid $85,000 from his own funds to publish a page-wide advertisement calling for the execution of five Black and Latine boys wrongfully accused as the \u201cCentral Park Five.\u201d But the impact of a second Trump administration doesn\u2019t limit itself to any single area of the criminal legal system. He has proposed punitive policies that promise to dehumanize individuals at every point in the carceral system \u2013 from traffic stops to confinement conditions to sentencing. This tough on crime approach is also ineffective. Creating safe and healthy communities requires investing in programs that address the root causes of crime and disorder, like after-school programs, alternatives to policing, violence intervention teams, substance abuse treatment, employment pipelines, and affordable housing.\n\nTrump on the Criminal Legal System A second Trump administration threatens to increase inequities in our criminal legal system and reverse many reforms gained over the last two decades.\n\nSource: American Civil Liberties Union",

That kind of winning will happen, as it always does. What I mean is that no one is going to win the way too many of us define winning in this strange era.\n\nIn his new book American Covenant: How the Constitution Unified Our Nation\u2014and Could Again, Yuval Levin points out a dangerous illusion of the present: the notion that after one decisive victory, whoever is \u201con the other side\u201d will go away and will not need to be accommodated.\n\nIn truth, Levin argues, American life is pulled in two directions: toward what could be called \u201cconservatism\u201d in one direction and \u201cprogressivism\u201d in the other. Those visions look different in different times\u2014and, often, the two sides swap out on specific policy positions\u2014but the basic tension is always there.\n\nThis is because, Levin writes, any group of human beings is going to have disagreements. A constitutional order doesn\u2019t eradicate those disagreements but instead structures a careful balance between majority rule and minority rights.\n\nLevin argues that one of the reasons\u2014with some exceptions, of course\u2014that local and state politics tend to be less toxic than national presidential elections is that, usually, those debates tend to be about issues more immediately recognized as practical\u2014what roads get paved, what hospitals get funded\u2014and thus \u201clend themselves better to bargaining and accommodation.\u201d\n\nAt the national level, though, our candidates and our parties aren\u2019t as much about specific issues as they are about tribal identity. Even when motivated by grievance and resentment, as national politics now are, the grievances and resentments are about far different things than, say, the issue of free silver in the William Jennings Bryan era or corporate monopolies in the Theodore Roosevelt era. What this leads to, Levin contends, is the current situation\u2014in which presidential elections become about \u201cpolitical expression\u201d rather than \u201ccivic action.\u201d\n\nWhen we peel down below issues of national scope, we often find that the fundamental problem is not that the \u201cother side\u201d isn\u2019t going to accomplish what we want but that the other side exists at all. With that in mind, we can assume that this one election will put all that aside, and that those people, whoever they are, now permanently defeated and humiliated, will go away. But this is not true.\n\nIn his book Democracy and Solidarity, political scientist James Davison Hunter identifies this very dynamic as a culture logic that seeks not specific policy goals but something much bigger: recognition and status and identity.\n\nWhen that isn\u2019t achieved, we poison ourselves with fantasies that one day\u2014maybe right now\u2014we will finally enact revenge on those who have injured us by not conferring the status we believe we deserve. We want to find our own identity in the kind of \u201cnegative solidarity\u201d that unites against a common oppressor. We start, then, to assume that every election is working toward a post-election reality where, as the old hymn puts it, \u201cevery foe is vanquished.\u201d\n\nIn that kind of world, Hunter argues, in which the sense of status cannot ever be wholly fulfilled, the injury must be constantly emphasized. \u201cTake away the injury, take away its cause, take away the revenge it seeks, and both meaning and identity for the aggrieved dissolve,\u201d he writes.\n\nIf what we are seeking is not civic action but status, then outrage becomes authority. This quest for moral worth, status recognition, and self-esteem lends itself to precisely the kind of reality-television identity politics that we see right now.\n\nThis becomes a cycle. The more we expect of our politics to express who we are, the less we expect our politics to actually do. That kind of politics, after all, is going to result every time in what we\u2019ve seen over the past 15 years: narrow majorities that teeter back and forth between the parties. Big goals\u2014a New Deal, a Cold War victory, a moon landing\u2014seem out of touch, so we replace those goals with what Hunter calls \u201cmillennialism.\u201d\n\nMillennialism is, of course, not a political doctrine but a theological one, rooted in the Book of Revelation\u2019s language of a thousand-year reign of Christ and his people. From the very beginning, Christians have argued about what that means\u2014is it a present reality in heaven or a future expectation after the reign of Christ, or something else? History shows that when those sorts of messianic expectations bubble up without the presence of the actual Messiah, they lead, at worst, to bloodshed\u2014and, at best, to disillusionment and disappointment.\n\nIf Joe Biden (or whoever the Democratic nominee turns out to be) wins, the Trumpists and whatever passes for the \u201cright\u201d these days will still be here. If Donald Trump is elected president, the \u201cleft\u201d will still be around. Whatever your political views, you can\u2019t have your millennium unless half the country is Raptured.\n\nIn his forthcoming book One Lost Soul: Richard Nixon\u2019s Search for Salvation, CT news editor Daniel Silliman looks at the 50th anniversary of the resignation of Richard Nixon through the grid of Nixon\u2019s lifelong quest for approval.\n\nNixon\u2019s father, Silliman recounts, ran a general store in what used to be a church, hollowing out the steeple so he could sit and survey the store from there, yelling criticisms at his son to work harder, do better. Silliman demonstrates how Nixon sought security throughout his life in the approval of the voters who would send him to office, in Dwight Eisenhower as a father figure, and in his own triumph over the \u201celites\u201d from Harvard and Yale who had looked down on him.\n\nSilliman argues that the reason we even have the Watergate tapes is because of that drive for approval. Who, after all, would record the audio of every single moment in the White House? Silliman compares Nixon\u2019s motivation to the old Jack Chick tracts, \u201cThis Was Your Life,\u201d in which, before the judgment seat, the sinner sees his entire life replayed in front of everyone (this tract terrified me as a child).\n\n\u201cNixon had a similar fantasy\u2014a complete recording, everyone on tape from his time in the White House,\u201d Silliman writes. \u201cBut in his version, he thought, he would not be condemned but justified.\u201d With a record of his accomplishment as president, he could prove that he had done a good job, that he was worthy of existing, that he was a great man.\n\nThe tapes, of course, did the opposite. They showed him to be exactly what he feared people would think he was: crooked, dishonest, a failure\u2014the first president in history to be forced to resign.\n\nNixon was driven by the wrong things. He expected too much, and public opinion could never love him back. Politics could never be a judgment seat that could justify his life. In this moment in history, we expect something very similar out of our politics: a vindication of who\u2019s right and who\u2019s wrong, a separation of the sheep from the goats, a final and definitive victory.\n\nIf that\u2019s what we think winning is, none of us will win. We will just descend more and more into resentment and outrage. We will turn on those we counted on to give us what they never could, or we will seethe in our fantasies of \u201cnext time,\u201d when we (this time for sure!) will get that ultimate win.\n\nThat\u2019s not what winning is. Until we lose that expectation, we will keep losing\u2014not just as a republic but as people whose lives are meant to be about much more than keeping score.\n\nNo one will win this election, ultimately. No one will lose this election, ultimately. Maybe we should ask whether we are seeking something where it can never be found, and ask ourselves whether we should be looking Somewhere else.\n\nRussell Moore is the editor in chief at Christianity Today and leads its Public Theology Project.",

        "text": "These are the Democrats who have called for President Joe Biden to step aside\nThese are the Democrats who have called for President Joe Biden to step aside\n\nAlthough President Joe Biden has made it clear he's staying in the presidential race despite his shaky performance at last month's presidential debate, several Democrats on Capitol Hill have publicly called on him to step aside.\n\nThe list has grown following the debate and after Biden's interview with ABC News' George Stephanopoulos in July.\n\nHere is the current list of Democrats who have publicly asked Biden to step aside.\n\nRep. Jim Costa\n\nIn a statement sent out July 18, Congressman Jim Costa urged Biden to step aside in the race, writing:\n\n\"President Biden has been an incredible President who has led this country back to strength after the Pandemic. I am proud of the work we have done to pass monumental legislation that is leading to the first real investments in our communities in decades. But for the good of the country, I think it is time for the President to pass the torch to the next generation to carry on the legacy he started. Democrats need to unite and deliver their strongest team to the American people in this election.\"\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin\n\nThe Maryland congressman sent Biden a letter on July 6 asking him to reconsider his campaign.\n\n\"There is no shame in taking a well-deserved bow to the overflowing appreciation of the crowd when your arm is tired out, and there is real danger for the team in ignoring the statistics,\" he wrote in the four-page letter.\n\nRaskin confirmed to ABC News that he sent the letter on July 18.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff\n\nOn July 17, Rep. Adam Schiff called on Biden to drop out of the race and \"pass the torch.\"\n\n\"Joe Biden has been one of the most consequential presidents in our nation's history, and his lifetime of service as a Senator, a Vice President, and now as President has made our country better,\" Schiff said in a statement released by his office.\n\n\"But our nation is at a crossroads. A second Trump presidency will undermine the very foundation of our democracy, and I have serious concerns about whether the President can defeat Donald Trump in November,\" he continued, then calling on the president to \"pass the torch.\"\n\n\"While the choice to withdraw from the campaign is President Biden's alone, I believe it is time for him to pass the torch. And in doing so, secure his legacy of leadership by allowing us to defeat Donald Trump in the upcoming election,\" Schiff said.\n\n\"But make no mistake, whoever our party ends up nominating, or if the nomination remains with the president, I will do everything I can to help them succeed. There is only one singular goal: defeating Donald Trump. The stakes are just too high,\" he added.\n\nInfluential congressman Rep. Adam Schiff is calling on President Biden to withdraw from his re-election bid, predicting he'll lose to Donald Trump.\n\nRep. Mike Levin\n\nThe California congressman said in a statement on July 12 that he heard from \"several hundred\" of his constituents and they shared his concern about Biden's viability in November.\n\n\"Once again, our national mettle must be forged in the crucible of history. It is time to move forward. With a new leader. Together,\" Levin said.\n\nRep. Brittany Pettersen\n\nThe freshman representative from Colorado posted a lengthy statement on X on July 12 urging Biden to \"pass the torch\" to \"one of our many capable Democratic leaders so we have the best chance to defeat Donald Trump.\"\n\n\"Joe Biden saved our country once, and I'm joining the growing number of people in my district and across the country to ask him to do it again,\" Pettersen said.\n\nRep. Eric Sorensen\n\nAdding to the growing list of Democratic representatives calling for Biden to exit the presidential race, Rep. Eric Sorensen of Illinois released a statement following the NATO press conference on July 11.\n\n\"In 2020, Joe Biden ran for President with the purpose of putting country over party. Today, I am asking him to do that again,\" Sorensen said.\n\n\"I am hopeful President Biden will step aside in his campaign for President,\" he said.\n\nRep. Scott Peters\n\nHouse Democratic Rep. Scott Peters of California called on President Biden to step aside from the presidential race following Biden's NATO press conference on July 11.\n\n\"Today I ask President Biden to withdraw from the presidential campaign,\" Peters said, adding, \"The stakes are high, and we are on a losing course. My conscience requires me to speak up and put loyalty to the country and to democracy ahead of my great affection for, and loyalty to, the President and those around him.\"\n\n\"We must find a candidate from our deep bench of talent who can defeat Donald Trump,\" Peters said.\n\nRep. Jim Himes\n\nFollowing President Biden's NATO press conference, Connecticut Congressman Jim Himes released a statement, calling on Biden to \"step away from the presidential campaign.\"\n\nHimes serves as a ranking Democratic member in the House Intelligence Committee.\n\n\"The 2024 election will define the future of American democracy, and we must put forth the strongest candidate possible to confront the threat posed by Trump's MAGA authoritarianism,\" Himes said.\n\n\"I no longer believe that is Joe Biden, and I hope that, as he has throughout a lifetime of public service, he will continue to put our nation first, and, as he promised, make way for a new generation of leaders,\" he said.\n\nRep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez\n\nThe Washington congresswoman, who flipped her district in 2022, not only called for the president to end his re-election bid but vocally questioned his fitness for the rest of the term in a statement released on July 11.\n\n\"Like most people, I represent in Southwest Washington, I doubt the President's judgment about his health, his fitness to do the job, and whether he is the one making important decisions about our country, rather than unelected advisors,\" she said. \"Americans deserve to feel their president is fit enough to do the job.\"\n\nRep. Greg Stanton\n\nThe Arizona congressman touted Biden's accomplishments in a statement on July 11, but said the president's \"most defining legacy, though, is as a fierce defender of American democracy.\"\n\n\"The Democratic Party must have a nominee who can effectively make the case against Trump, and have the confidence of the American people to handle the rigors of the hardest job on the planet for the next four years,\" Stanton said.\n\nRep. Ed Case\n\nThe Hawaii House member issued a statement on July 11 asking Biden to step aside, claiming, \"Difficult times and realities require difficult decisions.\"\n\n\"This has nothing to do with his character and record. If it did, there would be no decision to make,\" Case said. \"This is solely about the future, about the President's ability to continue in the most difficult job in the world for another four-year term.\"\n\nRep. Brad Schneider\n\nThe Illinois congressman released a statement on July 11 calling on Biden to \"heroically pass the torch to a new generation of leadership.\"\n\n\"We are faced with a stark choice: be resigned to slog through this election praying we can successfully defend our democracy, or enthusiastically embrace a vibrant vision for our future, building on the extraordinary foundation President Biden has created for our nation over the past four years,\" Schneider, the vice chair of the New Democrat Coalition said. \"I choose the latter.\"\n\nRep. Hillary Scholten\n\nThe Grand Rapids, Michigan, House member said in a July 11 statement on X that Biden needed to end his presidential run, contending that it \"is essential that we have the strongest possible candidate leading the top of the ticket -- not just to win, but to govern.\"\n\n\"The people of Michigan's 3rd Congressional District elected me to represent them with integrity. They elected a Congresswoman they trust to speak the truth, even when it's hard. They voted for someone who would put America's future first and stand up for what is right. That's what I am doing now,\" she said.\n\nSen. Peter Welch\n\nWelch, who represents Vermont, became the first Democratic senator to officially call on Biden to step aside in a Washington Post op-ed published July 10.\n\nWelch wrote that \"regular Vermonters are worried that he can't win this time, and they're terrified of another Trump presidency.\"\n\nRep. Earl Blumenauer\n\nThe Oregon representative, who is a senior member of the House Ways and Means and Budget committees, said in a statement on July 10 that \"we will all be better served if the president steps aside as the Democratic nominee and manages a transition under his terms.\"\n\n\"He should devote his energy and undivided attention to issues of war and peace, the climate crisis, and rebuilding and renewing America. I stand willing to assist in any way possible on these critical efforts,\" Blumenauer added.\n\nRep. Pat Ryan\n\nRyan, a moderate Democrat who is up for reelection in a crucial district in upstate New York, said in an op-ed published in the Poughkeepsie Journal on July 10 that Biden needed to step aside due to what he said was the threat posed by a second Trump term.\n\n\"If the two of them are on the ballot this fall, I'll be voting for Biden,\" he wrote. \"But I'd be doing a grave disservice to the hundreds of thousands of people I have the honor to represent if I said Biden was the best candidate to face Trump this fall.\"\n\nRep. Mikie Sherrill\n\nThe New Jersey congresswoman, who flipped her seat in the 2020 election, released a statement on July 9 calling for Biden to drop out of the presidential race and to \"help lead us through a process toward a new nominee.\"\n\nSherrill told ABC News her decision to call on Biden to step aside came after speaking and listening to her constituents, colleagues and family.\n\nThe congresswoman said she felt she needed to \"advocate as strongly as possible for new leadership so we could really prosecute the case against Donald Trump.\"\n\nRep. Adam Smith\n\nThe Washington state House member released a statement on July 8 calling on Biden to bow out of the race and release his delegates before the Democratic National Convention in August.\n\n\"He is not yet the nominee. So I think we have a chance to pick a better candidate who can effectively deliver the message, get off of all of these distractions, focus on the Democratic message and on the dangers of Donald Trump,\" Smith told ABC News. \"And I think we need to take that opportunity.\"\n\nRep. Angie Craig\n\nThe Minnesota congresswoman said in a statement on July 6 that Biden needed to step down from the race, citing his poor debate performance and \"the lack of a forceful response from the president himself following that debate.\"\n\n\"This is not a decision I've come to lightly, but there is simply too much at stake to risk a second Donald Trump presidency,\" she said.\n\nRep. Mike Quigley\n\nThe Illinois congressman was vocal about his disapproval of Biden following the debate and called on him to step aside during an MSNBC interview on July 5, shortly after the president spoke with ABC News.\n\n\"Mr. President, your legacy is set,\" he said. \"We owe you the greatest debt of gratitude. The only thing that you can do now to cement that for all time and prevent utter catastrophe is to step down and let someone else do this.\"\n\nRep. Seth Moulton\n\nThe Massachusetts House member told Boston public radio station WBUR on July 4 that he believes Biden should withdraw from the race.\n\n\"President Biden has done enormous service to our country, but now is the time for him to follow in one of our founding fathers, George Washington's footsteps and step aside to let new leaders rise up and run against Donald Trump,\" he said.\n\nRep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva\n\nThe Arizona congressman told The New York Times on July 3 that Biden needed to reconsider his candidacy.\n\n\"If he's the candidate, I'm going to support him, but I think that this is an opportunity to look elsewhere,\" he told the newspaper.\n\nRep. Lloyd Doggett\n\nOn July 2, five days after the debate, the Austin, Texas, congressman became the first House member to call on the president to step aside.\n\nDoggett cited Biden's dwindling poll numbers in key districts and his debate performance as the factors behind his decision.\n\n\"I represent the heart of a congressional district once represented by Lyndon Johnson. Under very different circumstances, he made the painful decision to withdraw. President Biden should do the same,\" Doggett said in a statement.\n\nRep. Sean Casten\n\nU.S. Congressmen Sean Casten called on President Joe Biden to withdraw from the presidential election.\n\n\"It is with a heavy heart and much personal reflection that I am therefore calling on Joe Biden to pass the torch to a new generation,\" wrote Rep. Casten in the Chicago Tribune. \"To manage an exit with all the dignity and decency that has guided his half-century of public service. To cement his legacy as the President who saved our democracy in 2020 and handed it off to trusted hands in 2024 who could carry his legacy forward.\"\n\nRep. Chuy Garcia\n\nAs part of a joint message with several other members of Congress, Garcia wrote, \"Mr. President, with great admiration for you personally, sincere respect for your decades of public service and patriotic leadership, and deep appreciation for everything we have accomplished together during your presidency, it is now time for you to pass the torch to a new generation of Democratic leaders.\"\n\nSen. Martin Heinrich\n\nSen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, became the third sitting Democratic senator to call on Biden to end his reelection bid.\n\nHeinrich said in a statement on July 19, \"this moment in our nation's history calls for a focus that is bigger than any one person,\" citing a possible Trump victory.\n\n\"By passing the torch, (Biden) would secure his legacy as one of our nation's greatest leaders and allow us to unite behind a candidate who can best defeat Donald Trump and safeguard the future of our democracy,\" he added.\n\nABC News' Ben Siegel, Rachel Scott, John Parkinson, Isabella Murray, Allison Pecorin, Lauren Peller, Oren Oppenheim and Jacob Steinberg contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Obama, Pelosi push for Biden to reconsider 2024 race\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Democrats at the highest levels are making a critical push for President Joe Biden to rethink his election bid, with former President Barack Obama expressing concerns to allies and Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi privately telling Biden the party could lose the ability to seize control of the House if he doesn\u2019t step away from the 2024 race.\n\nBiden\u2019s orbit, already small before his debate fumbling, has grown even smaller in recent days. Isolated as he battles a COVID infection at home in Delaware, the president is relying on a few longtime aides as he weighs whether to bow to the mounting pressure to drop out.\n\nLate Thursday, Montana Sen. Jon Tester became the second Democrat in the chamber \u2014 and now among nearly two dozen in Congress \u2014 calling on him to bow out, saying, \u201cBiden should not seek reelection to another term.\u201d\n\nThe Biden For President campaign is calling an all-staff meeting for Friday. It\u2019s heading into a critical weekend for the party as Republican Donald Trump wraps up a heady Republican National Convention in Milwaukee and Democrats, racing time, consider the extraordinary possibility of Biden stepping aside for a new presidential nominee before their own convention next month in Chicago.\n\nAs anxiety and information swirled, Biden\u2019s closest friend in Congress and his campaign co-chair, Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, told The Associated Press, \u201cPresident Biden deserves the respect to have important family conversations with members of the caucus and colleagues in the House and Senate and Democratic leadership and not be battling leaks and press statements.\u201d\n\nThe reporting in this story is based in part on information from almost a dozen people who insisted on anonymity to discuss sensitive private deliberations. The Washington Post first reported on Obama\u2019s involvement.\n\nCampaign officials said Biden was even more committed to staying in the race even as the calls for him to go mounted. And senior West Wing aides have had no internal discussions or conversations with the president about Biden dropping out. On Friday, the Democratic National Committee \u2018s rulemaking arm expects to meet to discuss plans for the virtual roll call nominating the president in early August, ahead of the party\u2019s convention later that month.\n\nBut there is also time to reconsider. Biden has been told the campaign is having trouble raising money, and key Democrats see an opportunity as he is away from the campaign for a few days to encourage his exit. Among his Cabinet, some are resigned to the likelihood of him losing in November.\n\nPresident Joe Biden walks to his car after stepping off of Air Force One at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, Wednesday, July 17, 2024.(AP Photo/Susan Walsh) President Joe Biden walks to his car after stepping off of Air Force One at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, Wednesday, July 17, 2024.(AP Photo/Susan Walsh) Share Share Copy Link copied\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nX\n\nReddit\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nFlipboard\n\nPrint Read More\n\nBiden, 81, tested positive for COVID-19 while traveling in Las Vegas earlier this week and is experiencing \u201cmild symptoms\u201d including \u201cgeneral malaise\u201d from the infection, the White House said.\n\nThe president himself, in a radio interview taped just before he tested positive, dismissed the idea it was too late for him to recover politically, telling Univision\u2019s Luis Sandoval that many people don\u2019t focus on the November election until September.\n\n\u201cAll the talk about who\u2019s leading and where and how, is kind of, you know \u2014 everything so far between Trump and me has been basically even,\u201d he said in an excerpt of the interview released Thursday.\n\nBut in Congress, Democratic lawmakers have begun having private conversations about lining up behind Vice President Kamala Harris as an alternative. One lawmaker said Biden\u2019s own advisers are unable to reach a unanimous recommendation about what he should do. More in Congress are considering joining the others who have called for Biden to drop out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear the issue won\u2019t go away,\u201d said Vermont Sen. Peter Welch, the other Senate Democrat who has publicly said Biden should exit the race. Welch said the current state of party angst \u2013 with lawmakers panicking and donors revolting \u2013 was \u201cnot sustainable.\u201d\n\nObama has conveyed to allies that Biden needs to consider the viability of his campaign but has also made clear that the decision is one Biden needs to make. The former president has taken calls in recent days from members of congressional leadership, Democratic governors and key donors to discuss their concerns about his former vice president.\n\nPresident Joe Biden leaves with Rep.

Control of the House and Senate is at stake, and leaders are keenly aware that a Republican sweep in November could launch Trump\u2019s agenda for years to come.\n\nSeparately, the chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Rep. Suzan DelBene of Washington, spoke with the president last week and aired the concerns of front-line Democrats seeking election to the House.\n\nMajor political donors, particularly in Pelosi\u2019s California, have been putting heavy pressure on the president\u2019s campaign and members of Congress, according to one Democratic strategist. Schumer has told donors and others to bring their concerns directly to the White House.\n\nAnd Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland used a baseball metaphor to suggest in a recent letter to Biden, \u201cThere is no shame in taking a well-deserved bow to the overflowing appreciation of the crowd.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, many want Biden to stay in the race. And the Democratic National Committee is pushing ahead with plans for a virtual vote to formally make Biden its nominee in the first week of August, ahead of the Democratic National Convention, which begins Aug. 19.\n\nRep. James Clyburn, a senior Democrat and key Biden ally, wrapped up several days of campaigning for Biden in Nevada and said: \u201cJoe Biden has the knowledge. He\u2019s demonstrated that time and time again.\u201d He warned against those who he said \u201chave an agenda.\u201d\n\nBut among Democrats nationwide, nearly two-thirds say Biden should step aside and let his party nominate a different candidate, according to an AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll. That sharply undercuts Biden\u2019s post-debate claim that \u201caverage Democrats\u201d are still with him.\n\nThe Biden campaign pointed to what it called \u201cextensive support\u201d for his reelection from legislators in key swing states as well as from the Congressional Black and Hispanic caucuses.\n\nOther Democrats in Congress have shown less support, including when Biden\u2019s top aides visited Democratic senators last week in a private lunch. When Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania asked for a show of hands on who was with the president, only his own and a couple others including top Biden ally Coons went up, according to one of the people granted anonymity to discuss the matter.\n\nAP AUDIO: Obama, Pelosi and Democrats make a fresh push for Biden to reconsider 2024 race ahead of convention AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports President Biden is self-isolating at his Delaware beach house after testing positive for COVID-19 while traveling in Las Vegas.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Joey Cappelletti in Lansing, Mich., Ellen Knickmeyer in Aspen, Colorado, Steve Peoples in Milwaukee, and Josh Boak, Will Weissert, Mary Clare Jalonick, Seung Min Kim and Stephen Groves in Washington contributed to this report.",

        "text": "What happens if Biden drops out of presidential race?\nDespite major donors reluctant to keep campaign funds flowing and more Democrats publicly saying that his chances of winning the November election are dwindling, President Joe Biden shows no public sign of stepping down.\n\n\"I look forward to getting back on the campaign trail next week,\" he said in a campaign statement.\n\nBiden is \"in this race and he's in it to win it,\" Dan Kanninen, Biden campaign battleground states director, said in a statement. \"Moreover, he's the presumptive nominee \u2014 there is no plan for an alternative nominee.\"\n\n\"It is high past time we stop fighting one another,\" Kanninen said. \"The only person who wins when we fight is Donald Trump.\"\n\nStill, if Biden does step aside, Democrats must swiftly decide who would replace him on the top of their ticket, and how.\n\nOne scenario would be for Biden to endorse an alternative candidate and ask Democratic delegates to transfer their pledged votes when they assemble next month at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nHistorically, convention delegates vote for the candidate who won the primary or caucus in their respective states. Almost all 3,896 Democratic delegates are pledged to Biden after he swept every contest in the country. But that \u201cpledge\u201d can be changed under DNC rules that allow for \u201cgood conscience\u201d to determine delegate decisions.\n\n\u201cThere may be some negotiation if Joe Biden were to decide to step aside to say, maybe we could at least encourage or endorse or try to set in place a way that Vice President [Kamala] Harris might be the nominee,\u201d said John C. Fortier, fellow focusing on elections at the American Enterprise Institute.\n\nHowever, delegates are not required to do so, Fortier told VOA. \u201cThere's not an absolute guarantee or legal way for him to switch his support to her.\u201d\n\nHarris a logical choice\n\nStill, Harris would be a logical choice to quickly coalesce delegate votes. She is already first in the line of presidential succession. Nominating a Black woman could also help secure African American votes, a core bloc of the Democratic Party\u2019s support.\n\nPublicly, she remains loyal. \u201cJoe Biden is our nominee,\u201d she said earlier this month. \u201cWe beat Trump once and we're going to beat him again. Period.\u201d\n\nAs part of the Biden-Harris ticket, Harris would make sense financially. Under campaign finance rules, Harris is entitled to spend the Biden-Harris war chest, which stands at $91 million, according to their last filing report in June.\n\nFifty-eight percent of Democrats think Harris would make a good president, according to a new poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, and about 30% percent of the public overall think she would. Forty-three percent of adults have a favorable opinion of her, including 74% of Democrats.\n\nHowever, Democrats might also want to avoid the undemocratic appearance of an automatic coronation of Harris as Biden\u2019s successor, especially if others come out to contest the nomination.\n\n\u201cThe goal of the party will be to have some sort of process before the convention and at the convention that allows whoever gets into the race to court the delegates,\u201d said Elaine Kamarck, senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings public policy organization and author of a book on how America nominates presidential candidates.\n\nThat process \u201ccould be any number of things,\u201d she told VOA. \u201cIt could be regional meetings. It could be a debate.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line is, should the president step aside, Democrats must quickly figure out who replaces him and who is likely to win the election, said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics.\n\n\u201cAnd that ought to be the same person,\u201d he told VOA. \u201cWhether they can do it in the time permitted \u2014 it\u2019s a month \u2014 is another question entirely.\u201d\n\nOpen convention possible\n\nNext month\u2019s DNC could be an open convention, where the delegates nominate someone other than Biden. It would be a contested convention if there\u2019s more than one candidate vying for the slot.\n\nA contested convention could be tumultuous and divisive, something Democrats would want to avoid two months before the election.\n\n\u201cAt this point, we don't have a contested convention. We might have an open one, but we don't have a contested one,\u201d Kamarck said. \u201cThere's no time, all right. It's a month, literally, from now to the convention. Nobody is calling delegates.\u201d\n\nIf there is a contest, floated names include California Governor Gavin Newsom, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nAt the convention, Democrats must also decide who will be at the bottom of the ticket, another process that could create both excitement and division.\n\n\u201cWhoever is the loudest in critiquing Harris' choice will probably be the sort of faction of the party that gets their nominee into the V.P. slot,\u201d said Jennifer Mercieca, professor of political communication at Texas A&M University.\n\nAhead of the November elections, that\u2019s a lot of turmoil for Democrats.\n\n\u201cIt's all speculation at this point,\u201d Mercieca told VOA. \u201cWe have no idea; we've not seen anything like this before.\u201d\n\nAt separate occasions, Biden has said that the direst of polling results could get him to quit, or if there is a \u201cmedical condition that emerged,\u201d or if the \u201cLord Almighty comes out and tells\u201d him to.\n\nThe president remains in isolation in his vacation home in Delaware, following his COVID diagnosis this week.",

        "text": "Election 2024: Will Joe Biden Exit the Presidential Race?\nThe nation turned its eyes to Milwaukee last night as Donald J. Trump accepted the Republican Party\u2019s presidential nomination for the third election in a row. But the question on everyone\u2019s mind inside and outside the Fiserv Forum was, who will be his opponent in November?\n\nThe pressure on Joe Biden to step aside as the Democratic presidential candidate that died down last week flared again this week. The news media reported that former President Barack Obama, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi each told Biden privately in their own way that his chances of winning were fading and that he would be imperiling the party if he stayed in the race. Jon Tester of Montana and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico became the second and third Democratic senators to call on Biden to head to the sidelines. California Democratic Senate candidate Adam Schiff, a close confidant of Pelosi\u2019s, added his name to those urging Biden to step down. Just this morning, four Democratic Congressmen asked Biden \u201cto pass the torch to a new generation of Democratic leaders.\u201d More defections, possibly a stampede of them, seem likely.\n\nBiden, who tested positive for Covid on Wednesday and had to leave the campaign trail, can\u2019t find much comfort in poll numbers or campaign contributions. An AP-NORC poll out this week found that 65 percent of Democrats want him to leave the race, and just 27 percent are very or extremely confident about his mental capacity to be an effective president. Campaign contributions in July have fallen to less than half the $50 million originally projected.\n\nThe Water's Edge James M.

The Democratic Party\u2019s rules establish a process for replacing a potential nominee.\n\nThe question is instead whether Biden will leave the race. It is difficult, though not impossible, to push him off the ticket. But that would mean a bruising internal fight that would likely guarantee what Biden\u2019s critics are seeking to prevent\u2014Trump\u2019s election. That outcome could happen even if Biden bows out gracefully. Presidential campaigns are unforgiving, especially for new candidates and campaign organizations in flux.\n\nBiden continues to signal that he will remain in the race. His campaign chair told Morning Joe today that he will return to the campaign trail next week. That, of course, is not dispositive. If Biden decides to step aside, it\u2019s in his interest and the Democratic Party\u2019s to break that news rather than telegraph it.\n\nOne group rooting for Biden to stay in the race is the Trump campaign. It has built its Election 2024 strategy around attacking his weaknesses. Indeed, Trump advisers have attacked the dump-Biden movement as illegitimate. Senior Trump campaign adviser Chris LaCivita yesterday called the effort an \u201cattempted coup.\u201d If Biden does stand down, former Trump adviser Stephen Miller has signaled the Trump campaign\u2019s likely line of attack: \u201cNothing says democracy like holding a fake primary and then having donors handpick a nominee behind closed doors.\u201d\n\nWhether Biden stays in the race or not, the protracted debate over his fitness will only further complicate U.S. foreign policy. As I have noted before, countries, like people, hedge their bets. Many foreign capitals are already concluding that they will be dealing with a new president next January and trimming their sails accordingly. And if Biden does decide to step aside, he will automatically become a lame duck. That will raise a whole new set of questions and challenges.\n\nCampaign Update\n\nLast Saturday night\u2019s attempted assassination of Trump shocked the world and raised difficult questions about why the Secret Service and other law enforcement officials ignored warning signs that a shooter threatened the president. What\u2019s unknown is how the shooting will affect the presidential race, both in terms of tone and outcome. Fears of violence on the campaign trail were voiced long before Saturday. Democratic and Republican leaders\u2014there were exceptions\u2014joined Trump and Biden in calling for calm and a lowering of the political rhetoric, but fears about escalating violence and the fraying of U.S. democracy remain real. Adding an additional layer of concern are reports that the U.S. intelligence community has compiled substantial evidence that Iran is seeking to assassinate Trump.\n\nWith the selection of J.D. Vance as Trump\u2019s running mate, Democrats and Republicans have turned to negotiations over the timing and host of a vice-presidential debate. Trump agreed back in May on behalf of his yet-to-be-named nominee to a debate on either July 23 or August 13, or on an unspecified date after the Democratic National Convention closed. Harris had previously agreed to the July and August dates. The sticking point was which network would host the event. Harris agreed to appear on CBS, while Trump called for the debate to be on Fox. The July 23 date is no longer an option, and given the uncertainty about the Democratic ticket, August 13 likely isn\u2019t either.\n\nJudge Aileen Cannon dismissed the case that Special Counsel Jack Smith filed charging Trump with mishandling classified-documents case. Cannon based her ruling on the grounds that Smith's appointment was unconstitutional. Cannon\u2019s decision rejected longstanding precedent and builds on a point that Justice Clarence Thomas made in his concurring opinion in the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision on Trump\u2019s claim to unqualified presidential immunity. The Justice Department will likely appeal Cannon\u2019s ruling. Regardless of how that appeal fares, Trump will not face prosecution on the classified-documents charges before Election Day.\n\nWhat the Candidates Are Saying\n\nTrump\u2019s acceptance speech to the Republican National Convention last night set the record for length. It clocked in at a shade over ninety-two minutes. He beat the old record, which he set back in 2016, by nearly eighteen minutes.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Trump at RNC Video Pause Video Pause Trump at RNC Embed\n\nTrump didn\u2019t break any new policy ground in his remarks. As usual, he made a number of false claims, which news outlets fact-checked even if many voters don\u2019t seem to care. On the foreign policy front, he didn\u2019t stop North Korean missile launches\u2014they resumed before he left office. He didn\u2019t defeat ISIS in a \u201ccouple of months.\u201d The fight against ISIS, which began during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, continued for more than two years into his presidency. And while China signed a $50 billion trade deal with Trump, it didn\u2019t live up to the terms of the agreement. The United States didn\u2019t leave $85 billion worth of military equipment behind in Afghanistan; the number was closer to $7 billion.\n\nBloomberg Businessweek ran a story this week based on an interview with Trump at Mar-a-Lago. Much of the interview addressed economic matters. But Trump\u2019s answer to whether he would defend Taiwan against Chinese aggression likely set off alarm bells in Taipei and triggered smiles in Beijing. Trump complained that Taiwan took away the U.S. chip industry and said:\n\nTaiwan should pay us for defense. You know, we\u2019re no different than an insurance company. Taiwan doesn\u2019t give us anything. Taiwan is 9,500 miles away. It\u2019s 68 miles away from China. A slight advantage, and China\u2019s a massive piece of land, they could just bombard it.\n\nHe went on to add that if he were China \u201cI wouldn\u2019t feel so secure right now.\u201d No doubt.\n\nJoe Biden sat down with Lester Holt of NBC News for a one-on-one interview. Most of the conversation dealt with Biden\u2019s reaction to the attempted assassination of Trump, heated rhetoric on the campaign trail, and Biden\u2019s fitness for office. Foreign policy did not get a mention.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Biden Holt Interview Video Pause Video Pause Biden Holt Interview Embed\n\nBiden did apologize for saying a week ago that \u201cit\u2019s time to put Trump in the bull\u2019s-eye.\u201d\n\nWhat the Pundits Are Saying\n\nPolitico\u2019s Jonathan Martin detailed the alarm that Trump\u2019s pick of Vance to be his running mate has created among internationalist Republicans. Martin doesn\u2019t pull any punches about the division within the GOP over how active the United States should be in the world and where: \u201cTrump didn\u2019t just select a running mate here\u2014he doused political kerosene on the raging Republican fire over foreign policy.\u201d\n\nThe New Yorker\u2019s Jonathan Blitzer explored the evolution of the network of far-right groups that are championing Trump\u2019s election and creating the agenda they hope he will enact should he return to the White House. Blitzer wrote that \u201cthe Trump campaign has tried to distance itself from the most radical aspects of Project 2025. There are no benefits\u2014only political liabilities\u2014to endorsing so many specifics. Trump\u2019s supporters already know what he stands for, in a general sense. And there is the more delicate matter of the former President\u2019s ego. \u2018He wouldn\u2019t want to be seen as taking guidance from any other human being,\u2019 the former senior White House official told me. \u2018He doesn\u2019t like to be seen as someone who doesn\u2019t know everything already.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhat the Polls Show\n\nThe Pew Research Center issued a report today showing that American adults under the age of thirty have different foreign policy priorities than their elders do. Six-out-of-ten Americans between the ages of eighteen and twenty-nine flag combating climate change as their top priority. Only about four-in-ten Americans over the age of thirty feel the same way. Conversely, nine-in-ten Americans over the age of fifty see preventing terrorism as a top priority. Just 55 percent of young Americans do. The young and the old show similar divergences on issues such as Iran, Israel, NATO, and Ukraine, with younger voters being less supportive. One thing to keep in mind. Older Americans are far more likely to vote than younger ones.\n\nThe Campaign Schedule\n\nThe Democratic National Convention opens in Chicago in thirty-one days (August 19, 2024).\n\nThe second presidential debate is in fifty-three days (September 10, 2024).\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s sentencing hearing on his New York felony convictions is in sixty-one days (September 18, 2024).\n\nThe first in-person absentee voting in the nation begins in Minnesota and South Dakota in sixty-three days (September 20, 2024).\n\nElection Day is 109 days away.\n\nInauguration Day is 185 days away.\n\nAliya Kaisar assisted in the preparation of this post.",

        "text": "Noncitizens banned from voting in federal elections but not some local races\nDespite widespread GOP claims of rampant noncitizen voter fraud, federal law bans those without citizenship from voting in presidential elections.\n\nMarcela Rosas immigrated to Southern California from the Mexican state of Michoac\u00e1n more than a decade ago in search of the American dream.\n\nShe imagined a life with a house for her three children, educational opportunities and the ability to have a say in her community. There\u2019s one cornerstone of American life that Rosas, 52, hasn\u2019t been able to access: voting.\n\nWithout the ability to elect local leaders, Rosas says she feels powerless to push for change that might improve her family\u2019s quality of life, citing issues like rising housing costs and local taxes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf I had the opportunity to vote I could choose the people I want to represent me \u2014 people who understand my needs and my issues,\u201d she said. \u201cWithout the right to vote I feel segregated from my community.\u201d\n\nRosas is one of thousands living in Santa Ana who could have the chance to vote in local elections by 2028 if city voters in November pass a ballot measure granting noncitizens limited voting power. The measure has drawn intense opposition from locals and organizations who assert that voting is a privilege that should be granted only to citizens.\n\nThe battle in Santa Ana comes as former President Trump, now the official GOP presidential nominee, and other Republicans nationwide continue to raise the specter of immigrants voting illegally in the United States to alter the outcome of election results in favor of Democrats \u2014 despite robust election surveillance laws and decades of studies that dispute claims of rampant voter fraud.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe issue has come up repeatedly during this week\u2019s Republican National Convention, more recently by former presidential candidate and current Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who said on Tuesday that a fundamental GOP party value is \u201cwe believe you need to be a citizen in order to vote.\u201d\n\nNoncitizens range from individuals who are permanent residents in the United States to those who are undocumented. It can include those who have work permits, are refugees or are here under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. Depending on the jurisdiction, there are at times certain criteria a noncitizen must meet to be able to vote in local elections.\n\nDuring a news conference in May, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said without evidence that widespread noncitizen voter fraud was \u201cunprecedented and a clear and present danger to the integrity of our election system.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEven if you weren\u2019t concerned about the drop boxes and the ballot harvesting of mail-in ballots in 2020 you definitely should be concerned that illegal aliens might be voting in 2024,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Republican-led House passed a bill this month to require proof of citizenship for voter registration, even though federal law already bans noncitizens from voting in presidential elections. Those who break the law and register to vote without citizenship status in federal elections can face imprisonment or deportation.\n\nEven so, federal law doesn\u2019t restrict states from setting their own local and statewide election rules, which could include allowing noncitizens to vote in limited local elections, like school board or city council races.\n\nFewer than two dozen cities have approved local laws that grant voting authority to noncitizens, according to Ron Hayduk, a political science professor at San Francisco State University who has studied and written books about noncitizen voting rights. No state allows noncitizens to vote in statewide elections.\n\nThe majority of those cities are in Vermont and Maryland. A handful of jurisdictions in Massachusetts have also passed local noncitizen voting ordinances, though they remain inactive without state approval, Hayduk said. New York City passed a noncitizen voting law in 2021 that a New York judge then struck down as unconstitutional. A federal judge in March rejected a challenge to a Washington, D.C., law allowing noncitizens to vote in local elections.\n\nIn California, San Francisco became the first city to grant noncitizens some voting rights via a 2016 ballot measure called Proposition N. The measure, which went into effect in 2018, granted parents of school children the chance to vote in school board races. Oakland voters approved a similar ballot measure in 2022, though the law has not been enacted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn November, Santa Ana could become the third city that grants noncitizens eligiblity to cast ballots in municipal elections. The ballot measure differs from San Francisco and Oakland\u2019s laws, granting noncitizens voting rights in local elections for mayor, council members and ballot measures.\n\nProponents say allowing noncitizens to vote is about parity and giving those who pay taxes and contribute to a community a say in their local government. In Santa Ana, which has a population of more than 310,000, there are about 5,600 Vietnamese residents and 64,000 Latinos who are not U.S. citizens, according to Tracy La, the co-founder and executive director of VietRISE.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people worrying about the state of our democracy in this country and whether democracy is under attack, but for us what we really care about is how can it be a true democracy if there are so many people in our community that can\u2019t actually vote,\u201d La said.\n\nThe rules around who can vote and for what race vary across the country, Hayduk said. Some are limited to school board races, while others apply more generally to citywide elections. Some local jurisdictions require voters to be legal permanent residents or have work permits, while others allow any noncitizen to cast a ballot.\n\nBut the idea by Trump and other Republicans that immigrants are voting carte blanche and that Democrats are using those ballots to sway elections is a myth that has been \u201croundly debunked by study after study,\u201d Hayduk said.\n\nNot only are national and statewide election laws extremely stringent, experts say, but immigrants have a lot to lose putting their names on government records.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany states, like California, allow charter cities to create their own election regulations to enfranchise noncitizen voters, Joshua Douglas, a law professor at the University of Kentucky who has studied local voting rights under state constitutions, explained in an email to The Times.\n\n\u201cDoing so does not violate the U.S. Constitution as there\u2019s nothing in the Constitution that forbids the practice, and it does not violate the state constitution in states with state constitutional language that sets a floor for voter eligibility,\u201d he said, adding that it often boils down to whether state constitutional language authorizes \u201cevery citizen\u201d to vote, or \u201conly a citizen.\u201d\n\nA wave of states in recent years have passed constitutional amendments to make it explicit that only citizens can vote, and several others, including Kentucky and North Carolina, will put the question before voters on November\u2019s ballot.\n\nEven in states that allow the practice, there are typically restrictions around how and when noncitizens gain access to the ballot.\n\nTo vote in San Francisco school board races, noncitizen voters have to prove they are of legal voting age, a resident of the city and that they are the parent, guardian or caregiver of a school-age child.\n\nSan Francisco City Atty. David Chiu, who played an instrumental role in getting the ballot measure passed first as a civil rights lawyer and later during his tenure in the state Assembly, said the law is critical to ensuring all parents \u201chave a say in the direction of their childrens\u2019 education, regardless of citizenship.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChiu said there are strict rules governing how noncitizens vote in San Francisco to ensure the program fully protects election integrity. Noncitizen voters receive special ballots that only include school board candidates, and they have to reenroll in the program after every election.\n\n\u201cI am not aware of a single incident of a noncitizen casting an illegal ballot in San Francisco,\u201d Chiu said. \u201cThese (voter fraud) claims are simply not based in reality...and I would also say they misunderstand the operational aspects of current voting programs that protect election integrity.\u201d\n\nChiu later defended Proposition N as city attorney against a lawsuit filed by a conservative legal group seeking to block the law. A San Francisco Superior Court judge initially ruled the law had violated the state Constitution, before an appeals court overturned that decision and allowed the program to continue. The ruling also applied to Oakland\u2019s law, which faced a similar legal challenge.\n\nAttorney and conservative pundit James Lacy, who led the lawsuits in San Francisco and Oakland, filed another lawsuit in May challenging language used in Santa Ana\u2019s ballot measure.\n\n\u201cIf we possess anything important in our citizenship, it\u2019s the ability to vote and to participate in the body politic of our localities in our nation,\u201d Lacy said. \u201cWhen a noncitizen is allowed to vote, it diminishes the value of citizenship. It dilutes the vote of all citizens.\u201d\n\nThe impact of the noncitizen voting laws remains unclear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2018, only 65 noncitizen residents registered to vote in San Francisco\u2019s school board election, and 59 turned in ballots, according to the city\u2019s Department of Elections. Those numbers dropped to 36 registered voters in 2020, with 31 ballots cast.\n\nWhen three San Francisco school board were removed from office in a February 2022 recall election, registered noncitizen voters swelled to 328, and 235 people voted. Registration numbers dropped dramatically for another election that fall. Noncitizen ballots in the last four school board elections accounted for a fraction of the more than 1.3 million total votes cast.\n\nUp until 1926, noncitizen voting was commonplace in most states, Hayduk said. Citizenship mattered less than other societal markers of success, such as race, gender and class, meaning white male landowners, regardless of citizenship status, usually had access to the ballot box.\n\n\u201cThis idea that the vote is eternal, it\u2019s always been fixed, is incorrect,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s evolving. Democracy is evolving.\u201d",

        "text": "What the 2024 presidential election could mean for commercial solar\nListen to the article 6 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDavid Wei is vice president of finance and operations and Raaghav Salem Karthikeyan is a corporate development MBA intern at SolarKal.\n\nSolar has been on a tear, adding a record-breaking 32.4 GW and holding its place as the incremental market share winner in new installations in 2023. The clean energy source now accounts for 53% of all new electricity generation capacity due to both lower prices and federal incentives.\n\nWith only a few months until the 2024 presidential election, commercial real estate owners are eager to understand what\u2019s at stake for those federal incentives under the next administration. Unfortunately, President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump failed to shed any light on the topic of solar policy during last month\u2019s debate, barely touching on the energy transition.\n\nWhat might a change in administration mean for the Inflation Reduction Act and solar tariffs, and how could it affect solar adoption in the U.S.? Here\u2019s what we can expect.\n\nTrump\u2019s stance on solar and the IRA\n\nDuring his time as president, Trump was largely uninvolved with solar. He did, however, introduce a four-year, 30% tariff on imported solar modules in 2018 to encourage domestic manufacturing, which was then extended by the Biden administration.\n\nNow on the campaign trail, Trump and his supporters have become frequent critics of aspects of the IRA. Trump has indicated that he would seek to dismantle many of the IRA\u2019s policies and cut program budgets significantly if reelected. However, he has primarily attacked tax credits for EVs, batteries and wind farms. Tom Pyle, a Project 2025 contributor who was on Trump\u2019s Department of Energy transition team, has also stated that the former president is not as opposed to solar energy as he is to wind projects.\n\nConsequently, while the IRA is frequently in the headlines, only certain parts of the bill seem to be at risk under a Trump administration. For instance, Trump could hinder EV growth by rolling back pollution regulations or changing Treasury Department rules around EV tax credit eligibility, but a full repeal of the IRA seems unlikely.\n\nBiden\u2019s stance and a brief history on solar tariffs\n\nMeanwhile, Biden has been a clear supporter of solar and renewables via the 2022 signing of the IRA, which pledged $369 billion in tax breaks and subsidies for promoting clean energy, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and investing in sustainable infrastructure. More recently, the Biden administration has also allowed domestic solar production to skyrocket through the implementation of tariffs.\n\nBiden began his term by extending the Trump-era solar tariffs in 2021. The following year, however, he issued a two-year pause on new tariffs to support adoption of the clean energy source and expansion of the U.S. solar industry, aligning with the goals of the IRA. Since the pause ended in June 2024, tariffs on Chinese modules have risen to 50%. The Biden administration is also considering additional tariffs on Southeast Asian manufacturers as U.S. companies continue to compete with a flood of foreign panels in the global market.\n\nAs a result, thanks in part to the IRA and tariffs, domestic solar manufacturing capacity has grown to exceed 26 GW annually under Biden, increasing module supply and creating new jobs.\n\nWill the IRA survive a change in administration?\n\nTo repeal the IRA completely is an uphill battle \u2014 both the House and Senate would need to expend significant political capital to roll it back. It\u2019s also worth noting that inertia and precedent are powerful tools. The IRA has catalyzed hundreds of billions of dollars in private investments, potentially creating nearly 200,000 jobs.\n\nSince a majority of IRA-driven investment has benefited Republican districts, unpicking the legislation would risk harming GOP constituencies. Notably, Republican states account for 58% of the projects announced under the IRA. When looking at congressional districts that have invested the most in solar since the passage of the IRA, eight of the top 10 are Republican. Although no Republicans voted for the IRA, many of its provisions have GOP support, as noted by Rep. Andrew Garbarino, R-N.Y., co-chair of the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus.\n\nWithout full congressional support, and given the aforementioned investment considerations, a change in administration will likely only stymie and delay certain parts of the IRA\u2019s implementation through bureaucratic obstacles rather than guarantee a repeal.\n\nWhy now Is the time to go solar\n\nThe IRA has been wildly successful for solar so far \u2014 domestic production is skyrocketing, and installations are at an all-time high and accelerating. Moreover, IRS rules dictate that solar production tax credits would remain available for projects that start construction by 2030, reducing the risk of uncertainty for developers.\n\nAs we approach the November elections, given the uncertainty around future policy changes, now is the most opportune time to take advantage of current policies.",

        "text": "US Presidential Elections: Biden may step down as Obama, Pelosi join voices of concerns\nAmid a Covid-19 diagnosis and growing concerns over his candidacy among Democrats, US President Joe Biden might be reconsidering his Presidential bid.\n\nWhile Biden had been facing pressure from allies to step down, former President Barack Obama, too, has told allies that he thinks Biden\u2019s path to victory has \u201cgreatly diminished\u201d, the Washington Post reported. Meanwhile, Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi explained to Biden over a call about the party\u2019s chances to lose in case he doesn\u2019t step down, reported the Associated Press.\n\nIn an anonymous interview with the New York Times, few of Biden\u2019s closest people have stated that Biden may be coming to terms with the anxious demands of other Democrats. They also said that it should not come out as a surprise if Biden chooses to announce Kamala Harris as the new President candidate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresident Biden is currently isolating at his vacation home in Rehoboth Beach in Delaware, after being diagnosed with Covid-19 on Wednesday. The Biden For President campaign has called an all-staff meeting for Friday, July 19, reported the Reuters. He has also been told that the campaign is having trouble raising money.\n\nSenator John Hickenlooper, who was in 2020 up against Biden for the Democratic presidential nomination, has told Reuters that Biden is working towards a decision on whether to stay in the presidential race that is good for the country.\n\nLate Thursday saw Montana Sen. Jon Tester became the second Democrat to call Biden out for stepping down \u201cI believe President Biden should not seek reelection to another term, \u201c he said. \u201cI have worked with President Biden when it has made Montana stronger, and I\u2019ve never been afraid to stand up to him when he is wrong,\u201d Tester said in a statement. \u201cAnd while I appreciate his commitment to public service and our country, I believe President Biden should not seek re-election to another term,\u201d he added.\n\nAs further anxiety swirled, Biden\u2019s closest friend in Congress and his campaign co-chair, Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, told The Associated Press, \u201cPresident Biden deserves the respect to have important family conversations with members of the caucus and colleagues in the House and Senate and Democratic leadership and not be battling leaks and press statements.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPressed about reports that Biden might be softening to the idea of leaving the race, his deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks maintained, \u201cHe is not wavering on anything.\u201d",

        "text": "Trump says 'drill, baby, drill,' but the record for US oil production isn't his\nCrude oil production in the U.S. averaged 12.9 million barrels per day in 2023.\n\nTrump says 'drill, baby, drill,' but the record for US oil production isn't his\n\nAs former President Donald Trump accepted his nomination at the Republican National Convention Thursday, he did not mince words on what energy policy would look like in a second Trump presidency.\n\n\"I make this pledge to the great people of America, I will end the devastating inflation crisis immediately, bring down interest rates and lower the cost of energy,\" Trump announced to the crowd at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\n\"We will drill, baby, drill,\" Trump said, garnering resounding cheers and applause from the RNC audience who began to echo the oil and gas slogan.\n\nTrump continued, claiming an increased domestic production of oil and gas would lead to a \"large-scale decline in prices,\" and added, \"We will do it at levels that nobody's ever seen before.\"\n\nRepublican presidential nominee, former U.S. President Donald Trump speaks after officially accepting the Republican presidential nomination on stage during Republican National Convention, July 18, 2024, in Milwaukee. Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nThe former president took aim at the Biden-Harris administration's push for environmental policy and mocked the Green New Deal, which was first introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Edward Markey in February 2019.\n\n\"They've spent trillions of dollars on things, having to do with the green new scam, that's a scam, and that's caused tremendous inflationary prices, in addition to the cost of energy,\" Trump claimed.\n\nHowever, during Biden's tenure, the United States has continued to produce and export the most crude oil out of any country, at any time, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nCrude oil production averaged 12.9 million barrels per day in 2023, breaking the previous U.S. and global record of 12.3 million, set in 2019, according to the agency.\n\nThroughout his bid for reelection, Trump has been vocal about his plans to double down on reliance on fossil fuels and reverse federal climate action.\n\n\"As President, I will set a national goal of ensuring that America has the No. 1 lowest cost of energy of any industrial country anywhere on Earth,\" Trump said on his campaign website.\n\nOn May 13, during a rally in Wildwood, New Jersey, Trump promised he would halt offshore wind energy projects \"on day one\" if elected.\n\n\"I'm going to write it out in an executive order. It's going to end on day one,\" Trump said, claiming that wind turbines \"kill\" whales, which was later denied by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nIn this Nov. 24, 2019 file photo, the sun sets behind a crude oil pump jack on a drill pad in Loving County, Texas. Angus Mordant/Reuters\n\nAhead of the election, several former Trump administration officials and conservative activists have released a \"Presidential Transition Project\" titled Project 2025 that lists proposals for the new administration if Trump were to take office.\n\nAmong the proposals are sweeping cuts to climate initiatives, saying the next administration will \"stop the war on oil and natural gas.\"\n\nEnding subsidies for electric vehicles, withdrawing the country from initiatives for sustainable food production, preventing federal regulators from considering the economic impact of carbon emissions and abolishing the Energy Department's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and Loan Programs Office, are listed in Project 2025.\n\nThe Republican National Convention also saw the selection of Trump's running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, who similarly went after climate initiatives during his acceptance speech.\n\nVance said the nation needs a leader who \"rejects Joe Biden and Kamala Harris' Green New Scam and fights to bring back our great American factories.\"\n\nThis seemingly marked a shift in Vance's beliefs, who, during a speech at Ohio State University in 2020, said, \"We of course have a climate problem in our society,\" and added that reliance on natural gas \"isn't going to take us to a clean energy future.\"",

        "text": "Pressure mounts on Biden as tally of Democrats urging withdrawal passes 30\nA beleaguered Joe Biden entered potentially the most decisive weekend of his 50-year political career on Friday as the growing list of Democratic members of Congress calling on him to step aside surpassed 30, with the latest being the Ohio senator Sherrod Brown.\n\nBiden is recovering from Covid-19 in self-isolation at his home in Delaware and reportedly feeling \u201cangry and betrayed\u201d by allies and speculation mounted that he might be preparing to announce his withdrawal from the race.\n\nAdvisers were reported to be discussing the details, timing and setting of a possible withdrawal announcement, and a mood of resignation before Biden\u2019s departure was said to be rampant among his campaign staff.\n\nWith six in 10 Democratic voters telling an AP-Norc Centre for Public Affairs Research poll released on Friday that Kamala Harris would make a good president, allies of the vice-president were making discreet preparations for her to assume the top of the presidential ticket, courting donors and crafting a new message to be used in the event she becomes the candidate.\n\nA rare glimmer of light for Biden came in a letter on Thursday signed by more than 1,400 Black female supporters, who argued that he should remain the candidate, and that any attempt to change the ticket would \u201ccircumvent the will of millions of voters who participated in a democratic process\u201d in the primaries. Another public statement of support on Thursday came from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the New York congresswoman, who during an Instagram live stream on Thursday urged Democrats to reconsider their efforts to push Biden out.\n\nOn Friday, Bernie Sanders also urged support for Biden.\n\nThe Congressional Hispanic caucus\u2019s campaign arm also announced on Friday that it was endorsing Biden, which is no surprise given the group\u2019s opposition to Trump but noteworthy at a moment when the president is fighting for his political life. \u201cAnother Trump presidency would be disastrous to the Latino community across the country,\u201d the group\u2019s chairwoman, Linda S\u00e1nchez, said.\n\nBut with more than 30 Democrats in Congress, including the leading California representative Adam Schiff, having now called on Biden to step down, the president was said to be angry at senior figures in the party for encouraging the discontent. Chief among them is Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker who has tried to persuade Biden of his declining poll numbers, as well as Barack Obama and Bill and Hillary Clinton, who Biden reportedly feels have undermined him through their conspicuous silence.\n\nLate on Friday evening, Senator Brown released a statement: \u201cAt this critical time, our full attention must return to these important issues. I think the president should end his campaign.\u201d\n\nAfter weeks of defiantly stating that he will remain the Democratic nominee, despite concerns about his age and mental acuity in the wake of last month\u2019s disastrous debate against Donald Trump, some media outlets were reporting that Biden was reconsidering his position. \u201cReality is setting in,\u201d a source close to Biden told the New York Times, adding that it would not be surprising if Biden announced his withdrawal soon to allow Harris to take the nomination.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how [Biden] can outmanoeuvre the sustained attacks,\u201d Politico quoted a Democratic figure close to the White House as saying. \u201cIt feels like the ending is near.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s resolve had reportedly been shaken by a combination of the intensive machinations of Pelosi, fresh poll data from swing states showing his path to an electoral college victory narrowing, and a boycott by key donors, the latest of whom reportedly was the Silicon Valley billionaire Michael Moritz.\n\nPelosi, long one of his most important allies, is said to have used her knowledge of polling data and the political map to persuade him that his position is weak.\n\nBiden has repeatedly insisted that he has polling evidence showing he could win, relying on data from his aide Mike Donilon. But when he made the argument to Pelosi in a recent phone call, she told him to \u201cput Donilon on the phone\u201d so she could counter it with her own polling and implying that the president was not being kept informed, the New York Times reported.\n\nPublic pressure intensified further on Thursday when the Senate Democrats Jon Tester of Montana and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico publicly urged Biden to step aside. Many more than the 30-plus congressional Democrats who have publicly called for his withdrawal have done so in private.\n\nFour House members \u2013 Jared Huffman of California, Marc Veasey of Texas, Chuy Garcia of Illinois, and Mark Pocan of Wisconsin \u2013 issued a plea jointly Friday.\n\n\u201cThey wrote to Biden: \u201cMr President, you have always put our country and our values first. We call on you to do it once again, so that we can come together and save the country we love.\u201d\n\nThree further separate calls were made by Zoe Lofgren of California, a close Pelosi ally, Sean Casten of Illinois, and Greg Landsman of Ohio, whose seat is one of the Republicans\u2019 top targets in November\u2019s election.\n\nAllies of Pelosi depicted her as exercising sensitivity towards Biden \u2013 by recognising his achievements as president, long record of political service and the fact that he has Covid \u2013 while subtly using gentle persuasion.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s like a magician,\u201d one source told the Hill. \u201cShe\u2019s extraordinarily intentional. She\u2019s trying hard to keep the balance and helping him reach a decision by gently pulling, never pushing.\u201d\n\nThat cut little ice with Biden\u2019s allies, one of whom compared his fate to Julius Caesar.\n\n\u201cPeople who have known this man for 30, 40 years are stabbing this man in the front and the back,\u201d a senior campaign and administration aide told Politico. \u201cThey are JULIUS CAESAR-ing this man.\u201d\n\nBiden himself was reported to share such sentiments, telling aides that he feels \u201churt and betrayed\u201d at how the party\u2019s leading figures \u2013 who he has previously derided as \u201celites\u201d \u2013 have tried to push him out.\n\nOne Biden ally told NBC News that the party leaders now trying to force him from the ticket were to blame for Trump\u2019s victory in the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cCan we all just remember for a minute that these same people who are trying to push Joe Biden out are the same people who literally gave us all Donald Trump? In 2015, Obama, Pelosi, [Chuck] Schumer [the Democratic Senate majority leader] pushed Biden aside in favour of Hillary; they were wrong then, and they are wrong now,\u201d the source said.\n\n\u201cPerhaps we should learn a few lessons from 2016; one of them is polls are BS. And two, maybe, just maybe, Joe Biden is more in touch with actual Americans than Obama-Pelosi-Schumer?\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign chair, Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon, continued to stress that Biden had \u201cwork to do\u201d but said the campaign did not have its \u201chead in the sand\u201d.\n\nEmphasizing that Biden\u2019s campaign trail appearances have been reassuring to the campaign, she said: \u201cThe more and more people that see Joe Biden out there post-debate they are reassured.\u201d\n\nSuch defiance seemed increasingly rare inside the Biden campaign, however, with CNN reporting that some staff had undergone a \u201cquiet quit\u201d process. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can find a person who is off the record saying he should stay in,\u201d one said. \u201cThere\u2019s a growing sense that it\u2019s game over.\u201d\n\nLauren Gambino contributed reporting",

        "text": "Heritage Foundation\u2019s \u2018Project 2025\u2019 is just the latest action plan from a group with an over 50-year history of steering GOP lawmaking\nAs the 2024 presidential election heats up, some people are hearing about the Heritage Foundation for the first time. The conservative think tank has a new, ambitious and controversial policy plan, Project 2025, which calls for an overhaul of American public policy and government.\n\nProject 2025 lays out many standard conservative ideas \u2013 like prioritizing energy production over environmental and climate-change concerns, and rejecting the idea of abortion as health care \u2013 along with some much more extreme ones, like criminalizing pornography. And it proposes to eliminate or restructure countless government agencies in line with conservative ideology.\n\nWhile think tanks sometimes have the reputation of being stuffy academic institutions detached from day-to-day politics, Heritage is far different. By design, Heritage was founded to not only develop conservative policy ideas but also to advance them through direct political advocacy.\n\nAll think tanks are classified as 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organizations, which are prohibited from engaging in elections and can take part in only a small amount of political lobbying. But some, like Heritage, also form affiliated 501(c)(4) organizations that allow them to participate in campaigns and lobby extensively. Heritage is one of the sponsors of the Republican National Convention, which wraps up in Milwaukee on July 18, 2024.\n\nIn research for my forthcoming book, \u201cPartisan Policy Networks,\u201d I\u2019ve found that a growing share of think tanks are explicitly ideological, aligned with a single political party, and engaged in direct policy advocacy.\n\nStill, Heritage stands out from all of the groups I investigated. It is much more conservative and more closely aligned with former President Donald Trump\u2019s style of Republicanism. Heritage is also more aggressive in its advocacy for conservative ideas, pairing campaign spending with lobbying and large-scale grassroots mobilization.\n\nAmericans should expect to hear a lot more about its ideas, like those outlined in Project 2025, if Trump is reelected in November 2024.\n\nA new type of think tank\n\nTwo Republican congressional staffers, Ed Feulner and Paul Weyrich, formed Heritage in 1973 as an explicit rebuke to existing think tanks that they thought were either too liberal or too meek in advancing conservative ideas.\n\nFeulner and Weyrich were particularly incensed about how a preeminent conservative think tank at the time, the American Enterprise Institute, or AEI, timed its release of a policy report in 1971 on whether to approve government funding for supersonic transport airplanes, which can fly faster than the speed of sound. AEI published its recommendations several days after Congress voted on the issue, because it \u201cdidn\u2019t want to try to affect the outcome of the vote.\u201d\n\nHeritage turns this philosophy on its head. Rather than producing policy research for its own sake, Heritage conducts research, as one employee told me in 2018, \u201cto build a case, to make the argument for policy change.\u201d\n\nFor example, Heritage\u2019s affiliated 501(c)(4) advocacy organization, Heritage Action for America, and Sentinel Action Fund, a Super PAC set up by Heritage Action in 2022, spend money to influence elections and lobby elected officials on issues as diverse as taxation, abortion, immigration and the environment.\n\nFor this reason, some scholars and politicos call Heritage and other similar groups \u201cdo tanks\u201d rather than \u201cthink tanks.\u201d\n\nBecause Sentinel Action Fund is a Super PAC, it can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to influence elections so long as they do not coordinate with candidate campaigns. Sentinel Action Fund then spent more than US$13 million on voter outreach and advertising in the 2022 midterm elections. The fund\u2019s self-described aim was to ensure GOP majorities in the House and Senate by aiding \u201ckey conservative fighters\u201d in \u201ctough general elections.\u201d Sentinel Action Fund Vice President of Communications Carson Steelman said that in 2024, \u201cthe Sentinel Action Fund is totally legally separate from Heritage Action.\u201d\n\nPeople, not just money\n\nBut it\u2019s the people, even more than money, that make Heritage influential, my research shows.\n\nHeritage has directly worked to place former and current employees in congressional offices and the executive branch. More than 70 former and current Heritage staffers began working for the Trump administration by 2017 \u2013 and four current Heritage staffers were members of Trump\u2019s cabinet in 2021.\n\nHeritage also says that it has more than 2 million local, volunteer activists and roughly 20,000 \u201cSentinel activists\u201d who receive information from Heritage and take part in organized campaigns to push for conservative policies. My interviews show that activists who partner with Heritage take part in strategy calls, contact elected representatives with coordinated messages and amplify the organization\u2019s messaging on social media.\n\nIn one example from 2021, Heritage Foundation developed a report on election fraud and voter integrity. Heritage Action for America, meanwhile, coordinated volunteers to deliver this report to Georgia legislators, had staffers meet with these legislators to advise them on passing new voting restrictions, and paid for television advertising urging citizens to support such laws.\n\nHeritage, Trump and Project 2025\n\nAll these efforts add up to a great deal of influence within the Republican Party. Heritage has played a key role in pushing Republicans toward more conservative policies since its creation.\n\nWhen former President Ronald Reagan took office in 1981, for example, the Heritage Foundation had a ready-made conservative agenda for the new administration. By the end of his first term, Reagan executed more than 60% of the think tank\u2019s policy recommendations.\n\nWhen Trump took office in 2016, Heritage was again ready with friendly staffers and a handy policy agenda, called the Blueprint for Reorganization. By the end of Trump\u2019s first year in office, Heritage boasted that he \u201chad embraced 64 percent of our 321 recommendations,\u201d among them key conservative priorities like tax reform, regulatory rollback and increased defense spending.\n\nProject 2025 is similar to these other sets of recommendations for Republican politicians and presidential candidates. It outlines an agenda for a new president to adopt and a team of experts to help them.\n\nBut Project 2025 has taken on a different bent compared with earlier blueprints. Kevin Roberts, the president of Heritage, has described the group\u2019s role as \u201cinstitutionalizing Trumpism.\u201d\n\nThis is probably why Project 2025, and Heritage, have received such an unusually large amount of attention in recent months. The fact that a wonky, 900-page policy memo has been the focus of countless news articles and hundreds of Biden campaign tweets, especially before the 2024 election, is a telling indication of its expected influence.\n\nFor its part, the Trump campaign has maintained distance from the project, as Trump himself has implausibly claimed that he knows nothing about it.\n\nHe is likely keeping his distance from Project 2025 because parts of the agenda are far too extreme for all but the most die-hard conservative activists. But even if Trump isn\u2019t campaigning on these policies, Americans should expect Heritage ideas to matter greatly in a second Trump administration. The Heritage Foundation is built for this goal.\n\nThis story has been updated on July 18, 2024, to describe the current legal status of the Sentinel Action Fund.",

Another one of the sources described Biden as getting defensive about the polls. At one point, Pelosi asked Mike Donilon, Biden\u2019s longtime adviser, to get on the line to talk over the data.\n\nThis phone call would mark the second known conversation between the California lawmaker and Biden since the president\u2019s disastrous debate on June 27. While the exact date of the conversation was not clear, one source described it as being within the last week. Pelosi and Biden also spoke in early July.\n\nNone of the sources indicated whether Pelosi told Biden in this conversation that she believes the president should drop out of the 2024 race.\n\nPelosi has spent the weeks following the debate listening to concerns from her colleagues. Pelosi made waves when she said in an interview last week: \u201cIt\u2019s up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We\u2019re all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short.\u201d\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'This is the endgame': Van Jones reacts to growing pressure on Biden 00:45 - Source: CNN\n\nWhen asked for comment, White House spokesperson Andrew Bates did not respond to the details of CNN\u2019s reporting on the recent Pelosi-Biden call. \u201cPresident Biden is the nominee of the party. He plans to win and looks forward to working with congressional Democrats to pass his 100 days agenda to help working families,\u201d Bates said.\n\nA Pelosi spokesperson told CNN that the former House speaker has been in California since Friday and she has not spoken to Biden since.\n\n\u201cSpeaker Pelosi respects the confidentiality of her meetings and conversations with the president of the United States,\u201d a Pelosi spokesperson said. \u201cSadly, the feeding frenzy from the press based on anonymous sources misrepresents any conversations the speaker may have had with the president.\u201d",

        "text": "Why won't George W. Bush talk publicly about Donald Trump? It's simple.\nMILWAUKEE - Many Republican convention delegates like to salute the heritage of their party, but few of them these days talk about the next-to-last GOP president, George W. Bush.\n\nAnd that suits Bush just fine.\n\nFor while Bush still keeps up with politics - including the resurgence of Republican successor and fervent critic Donald Trump - he doesn't like to talk about it publicly.\n\nIn paid private speeches, the long-retired 43rd president has been known to joke that both Trump and President Joe Biden are too old for the demands of the office.\n\n\"I'm younger than both of the candidates, and I'm too old,\" Bush has said in at least one speech, according to a witness who requested anonymity.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nJust don't expect Bush, who turned 78 earlier this month, to say this kind of thing out loud - not even about Trump, the volatile businessman who built his political career in part by trashing the legacy of the Bush dynasty\n\nWhile people often call on Bush to speak out against Trump and the Republican Party he has remade in his own image, friends and associates said he is standing by his pledge not to critique other presidents and political leaders.\n\n\"The job of the president is very hard to begin with,\" Ari Fleischer, former White House press secretary for Bush, told USA TODAY. \"He doesn't want to make it harder for anyone, friend or foe.\"\n\n\"It's very old school,\" Fleischer added. \"It's very gracious. It's very Bush.\"\n\nIt also has public benefits for the former president - his approval ratings have more than doubled since he left office more than 15 years ago.\n\nBush has made the rare exceptions on his public comment policy, most recently a statement with former First Lady Laura Bush after last Saturday's assassination attempt against Trump.\n\n\"Laura and I are grateful that President Trump is safe following the cowardly attack on his life,\" Bush said. \"And we commend the men and women of the Secret Service for their speedy response.\"\n\n'He's turned the page'\n\nSince leaving office on Jan. 20, 2009, Bush has made his mark as a book author, the head of an institute based in Dallas, and even as a portrait painter - but not a political pundit.\n\n\"He's turned the page,\" said Margaret Spellings, a long-time friend who served as Education Secretary during the Bush administration. \"He's interested and he's connected and he's informed - but he's moved on.\"\n\nAnd vice-versa.\n\nWhen Republican conventioneers gather in Milwaukee next week to nominate Trump for a third time, the name of George W. Bush may never be heard.\n\nPrivately, Bush still follows current events. He gives speeches. He paints. Over the past decade-and-a-half, Bush has hosted dozens of fundraisers for favored Republican candidates, all behind closed doors.\n\nPublicly: not much. Instead, Bush has pursued a unique path for an ex-president, all but walking away from political life. This from the grandson of a U.S. senator and the son of a president, the scion of an historic political family.\n\nA few dust-ups with Trump\n\nBush has occasionally tangled with Trump, but it hasn't amounted to much.\n\nIn February of 2016, the former president stumped for younger brother Jeb Bush in his faltering Republican primary campaign against the first-time candidate Trump. Bush praised his sibling's qualifications, drawing implicit contrasts with Trump by talking about \"faith that reveals itself through good works, not loud words.\u201d\n\nThat became a part-time pattern after Trump became president. Bush would not call out Trump by name, but made clear he didn't like his divisive style, and sometimes getting blowback from Trump in process.\n\nAfter Trump's inaugural address in 2017 - the speech in which the new president talked about American \"carnage\" - Bush nor his aides disputed his reported reaction: \"That was some weird s---.\"\n\nDuring a 2021 ceremony in Pennsylvania to mark the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks, Bush made a point of saying that \"so much of our politics has become a naked appeal to anger, fear and resentment.\"\n\nTrump, who has often attacked Bush over the invasion of Iraq, said his GOP predecessor \"shouldn\u2019t be lecturing us about anything.\" He added that \"the World Trade Center came down during his watch.\"\n\nBush did leave office with very low approval ratings, sometimes well below 40%, in the wake of criticism of the Iraq war and the financial crisis of 2008. They've since jumped above 60%.\n\nAfter the attempted insurrection by Trump loyalists on Jan. 6, 2021, Bush issued a statement saying that he and Laura Bush found it \"a sickening and heartbreaking sight.\"\n\nWhile, again, not citing Trump by name, Bush added: \"This is how election results are disputed in a banana republic \u2013 not our democratic republic.\"\n\nIn describing Bush's approach, Fleischer said: \"He doesn't attack, but he knows how to roll his eyes at things he doesn't like.\"\n\n'Could you do the country a big favor'\n\nBush has remained quiet during Trump's re-emergence and march toward the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. He did not comment on the four sets of indictments against Trump, nor the hush money trial that made him the first convicted felon to seek the presidency from a major party.\n\nBush has also resisted a steady string of entreaties for him to \"say something.\"\n\nOn July 6, Bush's birthday, anti-Trump lawyer George Conway used the social media site X to send a unique salutation: \"Happy Birthday, Mr. President. Could you do the country a big favor and urge it not to elect a certain convicted felon and psychopath whom I assume you detest as much as the rest of us? Thanks in advance!\"\n\nFriends and associates said there's no real reason for Bush to engage.\n\nFor one thing, Bush is a Republican, and believes that a food fight with Trump would only help the Democrats, they said. Bush probably wouldn't gain much by it either.\n\nBush also feels, whatever the provocation, he owes Trump the same respect as all his other presidential colleagues.\n\n\"He just doesn't want to be in the game any more,\" said presidential historian Mark Updegrove, who pointed out that Bush uses the same phrase as Trump to describe the political environment: Swamp.\n\nSaid Updegrove: \u201cWhen I spoke to Bush shortly after he left the presidency, he said, \u2018the scene is a swamp out there right now, and I don\u2019t want to get in the swamp.' ... Since then it\u2019s only gotten swampier.\u201d\n\nUpdegrove, author of \"The Last Republicans: Inside the Extraordinary Relationship Between George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush,\" said Trump-type Republicans wouldn't respond to Bush criticism anyway.\n\n\"His influence in the party has waned,\" he said. \"It's an entirely different party.\"\n\nBush still has a public policy life\n\nFriends and associates said Bush has only withdrawn, mostly, from political life - not public life.\n\nThe former president does speak out frequently on policy issues, mostly through his work with the George W. Bush Presidential Center at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. It houses the Bush Institute, a nonpartisan policy organization, as well as his presidential museum.\n\nThe former president and his wife appear at events devoted to subjects that animated his presidency, including education, immigration, and help for veterans and military families. Another frequent topic is \"strengthening democracy, and advancing free societies.\"\n\n\"What he's wanted to do is to have the institute and the center focus on the issues that were important to him and Mrs. Bush when they were in Washington,\" said David J. Kramer, executive director of the George W. Bush Institute.\n\nThat also means the institute likes to avoid politics as much as possible, especially in these volatile times.\n\n\"A lot of things get very polarized very quickly,\" Kramer said.\n\nAuthor, painter\n\nSince leaving office, Bush has performed a more tradition role for former presidents: Book author.\n\nA memoir of his White House years, \"Decision Points,\" came out in 2010. He also wrote a short biography of President George H.W. Bush entitled \"41: A Portrait of My Father,\" published in 2014.\n\nThe younger Bush has also pursued a non-traditional pastime: Painting. Two books of portrait paintings have touched on Bush-era issues, veterans and migrants.\n\n\"Portraits in Courage: A Commander-in-Chief's Tribute to America's Warriors,\" came out in 2017. Then came \"Out of Many, One: Portraits of America's Immigrants,\" published in 2021.\n\nNone of these books include the word \"Trump.\"\n\nA little politics - in private\n\nBush also periodically comments on the news. After a private event in October, his office agreed to publicize his remarks about the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel.\n\n\"Don't be surprised if Israel takes whatever actions necessary to defend herself,\" Bush said at the event moderated by Updegrove. \"It's going to be ugly for a while.\"\n\nOver the years, Bush has hosted dozens of fundraisers for favored Republican candidates. This year's list has included Republican Senate candidates Dave McCormick of Pennsylvania and Larry Hogan of Maryland. He also has an upcoming event for Maine Sen. Susan Collins, who faces her next reelection in 2026 and opted to skip this week's RNC in Milwaukee to attend, among others, an event honoring the retiring director of her state's Potato Board.\n\nAn event in 2021 drew attention from Trump, as Bush headlined a fundraiser for Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, a GOP member of the congressional committee that investigated Trump's role in the Jan. 6 insurrection. She is also the daughter of Bush's vice president, Dick Cheney, who has criticized Trump several times over the years.\n\n\"Bush is the one who got us into the quicksand of the Middle East,\" Trump said in a statement that criticized the fundraiser.\n\nBush did not respond.\n\nHigher approval\n\nBush's reticence to inject himself into politics has paid off in terms of public opinion.\n\nHis approval ratings are consistently more than 60%, well above what they were in his later years as president, noted Jared Cohen, author of \"Life After Power: Seven Presidents and Their Search For Purpose Beyond the White House.\"\n\nIn the book - which is sold at the Bush museum bookstore - Cohen noted that Bush has prospered with public opinion even though his Republican successor, Trump, rejected many of his policies (and Democrats never approved him in the first place).\n\n\"He moved on from politics, and in an age when everything is political, that\u2019s earned him respect.\" Cohen said.\n\nFor his part, Bush still likes to joke that historians are still debating aspects of \"the first George W\" - George Washington.\n\n\"Whatever the verdict on my presidency, I\u2019m comfortable with the fact that I won\u2019t be around to hear it,\" Bush wrote in the epilogue of his memoir. \"That\u2019s a decision point only history will reach.\"",

        "text": "FiveThirtyEight\nAmerican news website\n\n538, originally rendered as FiveThirtyEight, is an American website that focused on opinion poll analysis, politics, economics, and sports blogging in the United States.[2] Founder Nate Silver left in 2023, taking the rights to his forecasting model with him to his website Silver Bulletin.[3][4][5] 538's new owner Disney hired G. Elliott Morris to develop a new model.[3][4] On September 18, 2023, the original website domain at fivethirtyeight.com was closed, and web traffic became redirected to ABC News pages.[2] The logo was replaced, with the name 538 now used instead of FiveThirtyEight.\n\nThe website, which takes its name from the number of electors in the United States electoral college,[538 1] was founded on March 7, 2008, as a polling aggregation website with a blog created by analyst Nate Silver. In August 2010, the blog became a licensed feature of The New York Times online and was renamed FiveThirtyEight: Nate Silver's Political Calculus. In July 2013, ESPN acquired FiveThirtyEight, hiring Silver as editor-in-chief and a contributor for ESPN.com; the new publication launched on March 17, 2014.[6] Since then, the FiveThirtyEight blog has covered a broad spectrum of subjects including politics, sports, science, economics, and popular culture. In 2018, the operations were transferred from ESPN to sister property ABC News (also under parent The Walt Disney Company).\n\nDuring the presidential primaries and general election of 2008 the site compiled polling data through a unique methodology derived from Silver's experience in sabermetrics to \"balance out the polls with comparative demographic data\".[7][8] Silver weighted \"each poll based on the pollster's historical track record, sample size, and recentness of the poll\".[9] Since the 2008 election, the site has published articles\u2014typically creating or analyzing statistical information\u2014on a wide variety of topics in current politics and political news. These included a monthly update on the prospects for turnover in the Senate; federal economic policies; Congressional support for legislation; public support for health care reform, global warming legislation and LGBT rights; elections around the world; marijuana legalization; and numerous other topics. The site and its founder are best known for election forecasts, including the 2012 presidential election in which FiveThirtyEight correctly predicted the vote winner of all 50 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nFiveThirtyEight has won numerous awards. These include Bloggie Awards for Best Political Coverage in 2008 and Best Weblog about Politics in 2009 as well as Webbies for Best Political Blog in 2012 and 2013. While under the ownership of ESPN in 2016, FiveThirtyEight won the Data Journalism Website of the Year award from the Global Editors Network.\n\nMethods [ edit ]\n\nOne aspect of the site is Silver's efforts to rank pollsters by accuracy, weight their polls accordingly, and then supplement those polls with his own electoral projections based on demographics and prior voting patterns. Silver said: \"I did think there was room for a more sophisticated way of handling these things.\"[10][11]\n\nFiveThirtyEight weighs pollsters' historical track records through a complex methodology,[538 2] and assigns them values to indicate \"Pollster-Introduced Error\". At its base, Silver's method is similar to other analysts' approaches to taking advantage of the multiple polls that are conducted within each state: he averaged the polling results. But especially in the early months of the election season polling in many states is sparse and episodic. The \"average\" of polls over an extended period (perhaps several weeks) would neither reveal the true state of voter preferences at the present time, nor provide an accurate forecast of the future. One approach to this problem was followed by Pollster.com: if enough polls were available, it computed a locally weighted moving average or LOESS.\n\nWhile adopting such an approach in his own analysis, Silver reasoned that there was additional information available in polls from \"similar\" states that might help to fill the gaps in information about the trends in a given state. Accordingly, he adapted an approach that he had previously used in his baseball forecasting: using nearest neighbor analysis he first identified \"most similar states\" and then factored into his electoral projections for a given state the polling information from \"similar states\". He carried this approach one step further by also factoring national polling trends into the estimates for a given state. Thus, his projections were not simply based on the polling trends in a given state.\n\nFurthermore, a basic intuition that Silver drew from his analysis of the 2008 Democratic party primary elections was that the voting history of a state or Congressional district provided clues to current voting. This is what allowed him to beat all the pollsters in his forecasts in the Democratic primaries in North Carolina and Indiana, for example.[12] Using such information allowed Silver to come up with estimates of the vote preferences even in states for which there were few if any polls. For his general election projections for each state, in addition to relying on the available polls in a given state and \"similar states\", Silver estimated a \"538 regression\" using historical voting information along with demographic characteristics of the states to create an estimate that he treated as a separate poll (equivalent to the actually available polls from that state). This approach helped to stabilize his projections, because if there were few if any polls in a given state, the state forecast was largely determined by the 538 regression estimate.\n\nTransparency of pollster ratings [ edit ]\n\nOn June 6, 2010, FiveThirtyEight posted pollster rankings that updated and elaborated Silver's efforts from the 2008 election. Silver expanded the database to more than 4,700 election polls and developed a model for rating the polls that was more sophisticated than his original rankings.[538 3][13] Silver responded on 538: \"Where's the transparency? Well, it's here [citing his June 6 article], in an article that contains 4,807 words and 18 footnotes. Every detail of how the pollster ratings are calculated is explained. It's also here [referring to another article], in the form of Pollster Scorecards, a feature which we'll continue to roll out over the coming weeks for each of the major polling firms, and which will explain in some detail how we arrive at the particular rating that we did for each one\".[538 4]\n\nAs for why the complete 538 polling database had not been released publicly, Silver responded: \"The principal reason is because I don't know that I'm legally entitled to do so. The polling database was compiled from approximately eight or ten distinct data sources, which were disclosed in a comment which I posted shortly after the pollster ratings were released, and which are detailed again at the end of this article. These include some subscription services, and others from websites that are direct competitors of this one. Although polls contained in these databases are ultimately a matter of the public record and clearly we feel as though we have every right to use them for research purposes, I don't know what rights we might have to re-publish their data in full.\" Silver also commented on the fact that the 538 ratings had contributed to Markos Moulitsas's decision to end Daily Kos's use of Research 2000 as its pollster.[14]\n\nOn June 11, 2010, Mark Blumenthal also commented on the question of transparency in an article in the National Journal titled \"Transparency In Rating: Nate Silver's Impressive Ranking Of Pollsters' Accuracy Is Less Impressive In Making Clear What Data Is Used\".[15] He noted that in the case of Research 2000 there were some discrepancies between what Silver reported and what the pollster itself reported. Other researchers questioned aspects of the methodology.[16]\n\nOn June 16, 2010, Silver announced on his blog that he is willing to give all pollsters who he had included in his rating a list of their polls that he had in his archive, along with the key information that he used (poll marginals, sample size, dates of administration); and he encouraged the pollsters to examine the lists and the results to compare them with the pollster's own record and make corrections.[538 5]\n\nIn September 2014, Silver put into the public domain all of his pollster ratings,[538 6] as well as descriptive summary data for all of the more than 6,600 polls in his data collection for the final three weeks of U.S. presidential primaries and general elections, state governor elections, and U.S. Senate and U.S. Congress elections for the years 1998\u20132012.[17] In addition to updating his pollster ratings, he published an updated methodological report.[538 7]\n\nOrigin [ edit ]\n\nLogo for FiveThirtyEight until 2023\n\nNate Silver started FiveThirtyEight in early March 2008, published under the pseudonym Poblano, the same name that he had used since November 2007 when he began publishing a diary on the political blog Daily Kos.[18] The name FiveThirtyEight derives from the 538 electors in the United States Electoral College.[19] Writing for Daily Kos, Silver had gained a following, especially for his primary election forecast on Super Tuesday, February 5, 2008.[20][21] From that primary election day, which included contests in 24 states plus American Samoa, Poblano predicted that Barack Obama would come away with 859 delegates, and Hillary Clinton 829; in the final contests, Obama won 847 delegates and Clinton 834. Based on this result, New York Times op-ed columnist William Kristol wrote: \"And an interesting regression analysis at the Daily Kos Web site (poblano.dailykos.com) of the determinants of the Democratic vote so far, applied to the demographics of the Ohio electorate, suggests that Obama has a better chance than is generally realized in Ohio\".[22]\n\nFiveThirtyEight gained further national attention for beating out most pollsters' projections in the North Carolina and Indiana Democratic party primaries on May 6, 2008. As Mark Blumenthal wrote in National Journal, \"Over the last week, an anonymous blogger who writes under the pseudonym Poblano did something bold on his blog, FiveThirtyEight.com. He posted predictions for the upcoming primaries based not on polling data, but on a statistical model driven mostly by demographic and past vote data. ... Critics scoffed. Most of the public polls pointed to a close race in North Carolina. ... But a funny thing happened. The model got it right.\"[12] Silver relied on demographic data and on the history of voting in other states during the 2008 Democratic primary elections.[10] On May 30, 2008, Silver revealed his true identity for the first time to his FiveThirtyEight readers.[538 8] After that date, he published just four more diaries on Daily Kos.[18]\n\nAs the primary season was coming to an end, Silver began to build a model for the general election race. This model, too, relied in part on demographic information but mainly involved a complex method of aggregating polling results. In 2008, Rasmussen Reports had an apparently short-term partnership with FiveThirtyEight in order to include this unique methodology for generating poll averages in their \"Balance of Power Calculator\".[23] At the same time, FiveThirtyEight's daily \"Today's Polls\" column began to be mirrored on \"The Plank\", a blog published by The New Republic.[24]\n\nIn July 2008, the site began to report regular updates of projections of 2008 U.S. Senate races. Special procedures were developed relying on both polls and demographic analysis. The projections were updated on a weekly basis.[538 9]\n\nBy early October 2008, FiveThirtyEight approached 2.5 million visitors per week, while averaging approximately 400,000 per weekday.[538 10] During October 2008 the site received 3.63 million unique visitors, 20.57 million site visits, and 32.18 million page views.[538 11] On Election Day, November 4, 2008, the site had nearly 5 million page views.[25]\n\nFinal projections of 2008 elections [ edit ]\n\nIn the final update of his presidential forecast model at midday of November 4, 2008, Silver projected a popular vote victory by 6.1 percentage points for Barack Obama and electoral vote totals of 349 (based on a probabilistic projection) or 353 (based on fixed projections of each state).[538 12] Obama won with 365 electoral college votes. Silver's predictions matched the actual results everywhere except in Indiana and the 2nd congressional district of Nebraska, which awards an electoral vote separately from the rest of the state. His projected national popular vote differential was below the actual figure of 7.2 points.\n\nThe forecasts for the Senate proved to be correct for every race, but the near stalemate in Minnesota led to a recount that was settled only on June 30, 2009. In Alaska, after a protracted counting of ballots, on November 19 Republican incumbent Ted Stevens conceded the seat to Democrat Mark Begich, an outcome that Silver had forecast on election day.[26] In Georgia, a run-off election on December 2 led to the re-election of Republican Saxby Chambliss, a result that was also consistent with Silver's original projection.\n\nThe ground game and \"On the Road\" [ edit ]\n\nDuring the 2008 electoral campaign, Sean Quinn, a second contributor, drew on his knowledge and experience with campaign organizations to evaluate the ground game and \"get out the vote\" strategies of the McCain and Obama campaign teams. A poker player, Quinn drew an analogy between Barack Obama's electoral strategy and a poker player having multiple \"outs\" for winning a hand.[27]\n\nIn September, Quinn launched a series of essays under the name On the Road.[28] Quinn traveled from state to state telling the story of the campaign from the electoral battleground, drawing on observations and interviews with grassroots campaign workers.\n\nAfter the 2008 U.S. election [ edit ]\n\nFocus [ edit ]\n\nDuring the first two months after the election, no major innovations in content were introduced. A substantial percentage of the articles focused on Senatorial races: the runoff in Georgia, won by Saxby Chambliss; recounts of votes in Alaska (won by Mark Begich), and Minnesota (Al Franken vs. Norm Coleman); and the appointments of Senatorial replacements in Colorado, New York, and Illinois.\n\nAfter President Obama's inauguration, Sean Quinn reported that he was moving to Washington, D.C., to continue political writing from that locale.[538 13] On February 4, 2009, he became the first blogger to join the White House press corps.[538 14] After that time, however, he contributed only a handful of articles to FiveThirtyEight.\n\nDuring the post-2008 election period Silver devoted attention to developing some tools for the analysis of forthcoming 2010 Congressional elections,[538 15][538 16] as well as discussing policy issues and the policy agenda for the Obama administration, especially economic policies.[538 17][538 18] He developed a list of 2010 Senate races in which he made monthly updates of predicted party turnover.[538 19]\n\nLater, Silver adapted his methods to address a variety of issues of the day, including health care reform, climate change, unemployment, and popular support for same-sex marriage.[29] He wrote a series of columns investigating the credibility of polls by Georgia-based firm Strategic Vision, LLC. According to Silver's analysis, Strategic Vision's data displayed statistical anomalies that were inconsistent with random polling. Later, he uncovered indirect evidence that Strategic Vision may have gone as far as to fabricate the results of a citizenship survey taken by Oklahoma high school students, which led him to denounce Strategic Vision as \"disreputable and fraudulent\".[30][538 20][538 21][538 22][538 23][538 24][31][a] FiveThirtyEight devoted more than a dozen articles to the Iranian presidential election in June 2009, assessing of the quality of the vote counting. International affairs columnist Renard Sexton began the series with an analysis of polling leading up to the election;[538 25] then posts by Silver, Andrew Gelman and Sexton analyzed the reported returns and political implications.[538 26]\n\nFiveThirtyEight covered the November 3, 2009, elections in the United States in detail.[538 27][538 28] FiveThirtyEight writers Schaller, Gelman, and Silver also gave extensive coverage to the January 19, 2010 Massachusetts special election to the U.S. Senate. The \"538 model\" once again aggregated the disparate polls to correctly predict that the Republican Scott Brown would win.[538 29]\n\nIn spring 2010, FiveThirtyEight turned a focus on the United Kingdom general election scheduled for May 6, with a series of more than forty articles on the subject that culminated in projections of the number of seats that the three major parties were expected to win.[538 30] Following a number of preview posts in January[538 31] and February,[538 32] Renard Sexton examined subjects such as the UK polling industry[538 33][538 34][538 35] and the 'surge' of the third-party Liberal Democrats,[538 36] while Silver, Sexton and Dan Berman[b] developed a seat projection model. The UK election was the first time the FiveThirtyEight team did an election night 'liveblog' of a non-U.S. election.[538 37]\n\nIn April 2010, The Guardian published Silver's predictions for the 2010 United Kingdom General Election. The majority of polling organisations in the UK use the concept of uniform swing to predict the outcome of elections. However, by applying his own methodology, Silver produced very different results, which suggested that a Conservative victory might have been the most likely outcome.[33] After a series of articles, including critiques and responses to other electoral analysts, his \"final projection\" was published on the eve of the election.[538 38] In the end, Silver's projections were off the mark, particularly compared with those of some other organizations, and Silver wrote a post mortem on his blog.[538 39] Silver examined the pitfalls of the forecasting process,[538 39] while Sexton discussed the final government agreement between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats.[538 40]\n\nPartnership with The New York Times: 2010\u20132013 [ edit ]\n\nOn June 3, 2010, Silver announced that in early August the blog would be \"relaunched under a NYTimes.com domain\".[538 41][34][35] The transition took place on August 25, 2010, with the publication of Silver's first FiveThirtyEight blog article online in The New York Times.[538 42]\n\nOn June 3, 2010, The New York Times and Silver announced that FiveThirtyEight had formed a partnership under which the blog would be hosted by the Times for a period of three years.[36] In legal terms, FiveThirtyEight granted a \"license\" to the Times to publish the blog. The blog would be listed under the \"Politics\" tab of the News section of the Times.[37] FiveThirtyEight would thus be subject to and benefit from editing and technical production by the Times, while FiveThirtyEight would be responsible for creating the content.\n\nSilver received bids from several major media entities before selecting the Times.[37][38] Under terms of the agreement, Silver would also write monthly articles for the print version of both the newspaper and the Sunday magazine.[538 41] Silver did not move his blog to the highest bidder, because he was concerned with maintaining his own voice while gaining the exposure and technical support that a larger media company could provide. \"There's a bit of a Groucho Marx quality to it [Silver has said]. ... You shouldn't want to belong to any media brand that seems desperate to have you as a member, even though they'll probably offer the most cash\".[39]\n\nThe first column of the renamed FiveThirtyEight: Nate Silver's Political Calculus appeared in the Times on August 25, 2010, with the introduction of U.S. Senate election forecasts. At the same time, Silver published a brief history of the blog.[538 43] All columns from the original FiveThirtyEight were also archived for public access.[40]\n\nShortly after FiveThirtyEight relocated to The New York Times, Silver introduced his prediction models for the 2010 elections to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, and state Governorships. Each of these models relied initially on a combination of electoral history, demographics, and polling. The 538 model had forecast a net pickup of 8 seats by the Republicans in the Senate and 55 seats in the House, close to the actual outcome of a pickup of 6 seats in the Senate and 63 seats in the House.[538 44]\n\nWriters [ edit ]\n\nWhen the transition to The New York Times was announced, Silver listed his staff of writers for the first time.[40] However, of the seven listed writers, only three of them had published on 538/New York Times by late December 2010: Silver, Renard Sexton and Hale Stewart. Andrew Gelman contributed again in early 2011.[538 45] Brian McCabe published his first article in January 2011.[538 46][c]\n\nBeginning in 2011, one writer who emerged as a regular contributor was Micah Cohen. Cohen provided a periodic \"Reads and Reactions\" column in which he summarized Silver's articles for the previous couple of weeks, as well as reactions to them in the media and other blogs, and suggested some additional readings related to the subject of Silver's columns. Silver identified Cohen as \"my news assistant\".[538 47] Cohen also contributed additional columns on occasion.[538 48]\n\nOn September 12, 2011, Silver introduced another writer: \"FiveThirtyEight extends a hearty welcome to John Sides, a political scientist at George Washington University, who will be writing a series of posts for this site over the next month. Mr. Sides is also the founder of the blog The Monkey Cage, which was named the 2010 Blog of the Year by The Week magazine\".[538 49]\n\nBeyond electoral politics [ edit ]\n\nWhile politics and elections remained the main focus of FiveThirtyEight, the blog also sometimes addressed sports, including the March Madness[538 50][538 51][42] and the 2012 NCAA Men's Basketball tournament selection process,[538 52] the B.C.S. rankings in NCAA college football,[43] the NBA,[538 53][538 54][538 55] and Major League Baseball matters ranging from the 2011 attendance at the New York Mets' Citi Field[538 56] to the historic 2011 collapse of the Boston Red Sox.[538 57] The site has also posted forecasts for the Academy Awards.[44]\n\nIn addition, FiveThirtyEight sometimes turned its attention to other topics, such as the economics of blogging,[538 58] the financial ratings by Standard & Poors,[538 59] economists' tendency to underpredict unemployment levels,[538 60] and the economic impact and media coverage of Hurricane Irene (2011).[538 61][538 62]\n\nAdapted from a FiveThirtyEight October 2011 graph published in The New York Times [ 538 63 ]\n\nFiveThirtyEight published a graph showing different growth curves of the news stories covering Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street protests. Silver pointed out that conflicts with the police caused the sharpest increases in news coverage of the protests[538 63] and assessed the geography of the protests by analyzing news reports of the size and location of events across the United States.[538 64]\n\n2012 U.S. elections [ edit ]\n\nFiveThirtyEight rolled out its 2012 general election forecasting model on June 7, 2012. The model forecast both the popular vote and the Electoral College vote, with the latter being central to the exercise and involving a forecast of each state. In the initial forecast, Barack Obama was estimated to have a 61.8% chance of winning the electoral vote. The website provided maps and statistics about the electoral outcomes in each state as well as nationally. Later posts addressed methodological issues such as the \"house effects\" of different pollsters as well as the validity of telephone surveys that did not call cell phones.[538 65]\n\nOn the morning of November 6, Election Day, Silver's model gave President Obama a 90.9% chance of winning a majority of the electoral votes.[538 66] The 538 model correctly predicted the winner of all 50 states and the District of Columbia.[45][d] Silver, along with at least two academic-based analysts who aggregated polls from multiple pollsters, thus not only correctly predicted all 50 states, but also all nine \"swing states\".[46] In contrast, individual pollsters were less successful. For example, Rasmussen Reports \"missed on six of its nine swing-state polls\".[47]\n\nAn independent analysis of Silver's state-by-state projections, assessing whether the percentages of votes that the candidates actually received fell within the \"margin of error\" of Silver's forecasts, found that \"48 out of 50 states actually fell within his margin of error, giving him a success rate of 96%. And assuming that his projected margin of error figures represent 95 percent confidence intervals, which it is likely they did, Silver performed just about exactly as well as he would expect to over 50 trials. Wizard, indeed\".[48][49] Additional tests of the accuracy of the electoral vote predictions were published by other researchers.[50][51]\n\nESPN and ABC News affiliation [ edit ]\n\nIn July 2013, it was revealed that Silver and his FiveThirtyEight blog would depart The New York Times and join ESPN.[52] In its announcement of its acquisition of FiveThirtyEight, ESPN reported that \"Silver will serve as the editor-in-chief of the site and will build a team of journalists, editors, analysts and contributors in the coming months. Much like Grantland, which ESPN launched in 2011, the site will retain an independent brand sensibility and editorial point-of-view, while interfacing with other websites in the ESPN and Disney families. The site will return to its original URL, www.FiveThirtyEight.com.\"[53]\n\nAccording to Silver, the focus of FiveThirtyEight in its ESPN phase would broaden: \"People also think it's going to be a sports site with a little politics thrown in, or it's going to be a politics site with sports thrown in. ... But we take our science and economics and lifestyle coverage very seriously. ... It's a data journalism site. Politics is one topic that sometimes data journalism is good at covering. It's certainly good with presidential elections. But we don't really see politics as how the site is going to grow\".[54]\n\nFiveThirtyEight launched its ESPN webpage on March 17, 2014. The lead story by Silver explained that \"FiveThirtyEight is a data journalism organization. ... We've expanded our staff from two full-time journalists to 20 and counting. Few of them will focus on politics exclusively; instead, our coverage will span five major subject areas \u2013 politics, economics, science, life and sports. Our team also has a broad set of skills and experience in methods that fall under the rubric of data journalism. These include statistical analysis, but also data visualization, computer programming and data-literate reporting. So in addition to written stories, we'll have interactive graphics and features\".[538 67] FiveThirtyEight launched its ESPN-affiliated stage on March 17, 2014. As of July, it had a staff of 20 writers, editors, data visualization specialists, and others.[538 68] By March 2016, this staff had nearly doubled to 37 listed on the masthead, and 7 listed as contributors.[55] The site produced articles under 5 headings: politics, economics, science and health, (cultural) life, and sports. In addition to feature articles it produced podcasts on a range of subjects.\n\nMonthly traffic to the site grew steadily from about 2.8 million unique visitors in April 2014 to 10.7 million unique visitors in January 2016.[56]\n\n2014 U.S. elections [ edit ]\n\nOn September 3, 2014, FiveThirtyEight introduced its forecasts for each of the 36 U.S. Senate elections being contested that year.[538 69] At that time, the Republican Party was given a 64 percent chance of holding a majority of the seats in the Senate after the election. However, Silver also remarked, \"An equally important theme is the high degree of uncertainty around that outcome. A large number of states remain competitive, and Democrats could easily retain the Senate\".[538 70] About two weeks later, the forecast showed the Republican chances of holding the majority down to 55 percent.[538 71]\n\n2016 Oscars predictions [ edit ]\n\nFiveThirtyEight sought to apply its mathematical models to the Oscars, and produced internal predictions regarding the subject, predicting four out of six categories correctly.[57] The website also compiled a list of other predictions made by other people using different methods.[58]\n\n2016 U.S. elections [ edit ]\n\nPresidential primary elections [ edit ]\n\nFiveThirtyEight applied two separate models to forecast the 2016 presidential primary elections \u2013 polls-only and polls-plus models. The polls-only model relied only on polls from a particular state, while the polls-plus model was based on state polls, national polls and endorsements. For each contest, FiveThirtyEight produced probability distributions and average expected vote shares according to both models.[59]\n\nAs early as June 2015, FiveThirtyEight argued that Donald Trump \"isn't a real candidate\".[60] When Donald Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee in May 2016, New York Times media columnist Jim Rutenberg wrote that \"predictions can have consequences\" and criticized FiveThirtyEight for underestimating Trump's chances. He argued that by giving \"Mr. Trump a 2 percent chance at the nomination despite strong polls in his favor ... they also arguably sapped the journalistic will to scour his record as aggressively as those of his supposedly more serious rivals\".[61]\n\nIn a long retrospective, \"How I Acted Like a Pundit and Screwed up on Donald Trump\", published in May 2016 after Trump had become the likely nominee, Silver reviewed how he had erred in evaluating Trump's chances early in the primary campaign. Silver wrote, \"The big mistake is a curious one for a website that focuses on statistics. Unlike virtually every other forecast we publish at FiveThirtyEight \u2013 including the primary and caucus projections I just mentioned \u2013 our early estimates of Trump's chances weren't based on a statistical model. Instead, they were what we [call] 'subjective odds' \u2013 which is to say, educated guesses. In other words, we were basically acting like pundits, but attaching numbers to our estimates. And we succumbed to some of the same biases that pundits often suffer, such as not changing our minds quickly enough in the face of new evidence. Without a model as a fortification, we found ourselves rambling around the countryside like all the other pundit-barbarians, randomly setting fire to things\".[62]\n\nOn the Democratic side, FiveThirtyEight argued that Senator Bernie Sanders could \"lose everywhere else after Iowa and New Hampshire\"[63] and that the \"Democratic establishment would rush in to squash\" him if he does not.[64] Sanders went on to win 23 states in the primaries.\n\nFairness and Accuracy in Reporting, a progressive nonprofit media watch group, wrote in May 2016 that FiveThirtyEight \"sacrificed its integrity to go after Sanders\" and that they have \"at times gone beyond the realm of punditry into the realm of hackery \u2013 that is, not just treating their own opinions as though they were objective data, but spinning the data so that it conforms to their opinions.\"[65]\n\nFiveThirtyEight's predictions for each state primary, both for the Republican and the Democratic party nominations, were based on statistical analysis, not on the analyst's opinions. The core data employed were polls, which FiveThirtyEight aggregated for each state (while also considering national polls) using essentially the same method it had employed since 2008. In the 2016 primaries, the projections also took into account endorsements.[66] The website also kept track of the accumulation of national party convention delegates.[67] In a comparison of prediction success published by Bloomberg News after the primary season was completed, FiveThirtyEight's prediction success tied for the highest percentage of correct primary poll winners, at 92%; but it lagged behind PredictWise in predicting a larger set of primaries.[68] Notably, even with FiveThirtyEight's track record of correctly predicting elections that pollsters get wrong, it still missed Bernie Sanders's upset victory in the Michigan primary, for instance, regarded as \"one of the biggest upsets in modern political history\".[65]\n\nPresidential general election [ edit ]\n\nThe final prediction by FiveThirtyEight on the morning of election day (November 8, 2016) had Hillary Clinton with a 71% chance to win the 2016 United States presidential election,[69] while other major forecasters had predicted Clinton to win with at least an 85% to 99% probability.[70][71] FiveThirtyEight's model pointed to the possibility of an Electoral College-popular vote split widening in final weeks based on both Clinton's small lead in general polls, but also on Trump's improvement in swing states like Florida or Pennsylvania, mixed with Clinton's poor performance in several of those swing states in comparison with Obama's performance in 2012.[72] The main issues pointed out by the forecast model was the imbalance of Clinton's improvement in very populated states like Texas, Georgia (projected safe for Republican) and California (projected safe for Democrats);[72] mixed with her inability to attract white voters without a college degree, an increasing demographic in swing states, in addition to a potential decline in turnout from minorities.[73] In consequence, Clinton's probabilities to win the Electoral College were not improving.[72] Silver also focused on state-by-state numbers in so-called 'must-win' states like Ohio and Florida, plus a consideration of polls' margin of error in advantages of less than three points.[74]\n\nDonald Trump won the election. FiveThirtyEight projected a much higher probability of Donald Trump winning the presidency than other pollsters,[70] a projection which was criticized by Ryan Grim of the Huffington Post as \"unskewing\" too much in favor of Trump.[75] While FiveThirtyEight expressed that \"nonetheless, Clinton is probably going to win, and she could win by a big margin\", the forecaster also made points about the uncertainty of poll trackers in some cases, the considerable number of undecided voters, and the unpredictable outcome in traditional swing states.[76]\n\nIn April 2018, it was announced that FiveThirtyEight would be transferred to ABC News from ESPN, Inc., majority owned by The Walt Disney Company.[77] ABC News Live streaming channel was launched on Roku in May 2019.[78] With the reorganization creating the Walt Disney Direct-to-Consumer and International segment in March 2018, ABC News Digital and Live Streaming (websites, ABC News Live and FiveThirtyEight) was transferred to the new segment.[79]\n\n2020 U.S. elections [ edit ]\n\nRedesign of forecast [ edit ]\n\nIn early August 2020, FiveThirtyEight announced that for their 2020 general election forecast they had designed a new graphical structure. This included going with modular structure, a \"ball swarm\" design for the chart depicting each candidate's chances, and the addition of a \"forecast mascot\" named Fivey Fox.[538 72] An episode of \"Chart Chat\" discussing the design described the direction saying \"FiveThirtyEight has leaned heavily towards a cutesy and engaging approach. The Fivey Fox mascot pops up next to most charts with call-outs to more further information.\"[80]\n\nFivey Fox would also issue reminders to readers of \"the potential for extreme outcomes\" according to Jessica Hullman, in a piece written for The Hill. Hullman also said of the design that the introduction of the mascot, in conjunction with the new simplified look of the page, was \"perhaps the strongest indicator that Silver intends to emphasize uncertainty\" in his coverage of the 2020 election.[81]\n\nJasmine Mithani, visual journalist with FiveThirtyEight, said in an interview when asked about the complaints of new mascot said \"I think the biggest complaint about Fivey Fox is that some people find it infantilizing, but that wasn't our intention\" and that the motivation for including the character was to help make the forecast more of \"a teaching tool\".[82] In November 2020, Rolling Stone reported that Fivey Fox had reached over 7,000 followers on his dedicated Twitter account.[83]\n\nThe forecast favored the actual winner of 48 states, the District of Columbia, and four of the five congressional districts awarding electoral votes, only missing Florida, North Carolina, and Maine's 2nd congressional district. In those three contests the forecast had favored Biden, but they were carried by Trump. Despite correctly forecasting Biden to win nationally, they overestimated Biden's margins in some battleground states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania and underestimated Trump's margins in states such as Ohio, Iowa and Texas. Their forecast showed Democrats winning Senate races in North Carolina and Maine, which Republicans ended up winning. However, their forecast did correctly predict that the Democrats would take control of the Senate. In the House elections, their forecast favored Democrats to gain seats, yet Democrats suffered a net loss of 10 seats. The actual house results fell outside their 80% confidence interval, with Democrats winning 222 seats, lower than the confidence interval's lower bound of 225.[84]\n\n2023 cost-cutting and 2024 elections [ edit ]\n\nIn January 2023, The Daily Beast reported that the website was on the \"chopping block\" amid cost-cutting measures by ABC News, and a sale of the website was being considered. It also noted that several key employees including managing editor Micah Cohen, politics editor Sarah E. Frostenson and sports editor Sara Ziegler had left the website and their positions had not been filled.[85] An ABC spokesperson responded to the report, asserting \"no imminent decisions about [its] relationship with FiveThirtyEight.\"[86] Nonetheless, in April, Silver announced that he would be leaving the site amid widespread layoffs at ABC News, who said the website would be \"streamlined\" ahead of the 2024 election cycle; editor Chadwick Matlin was among the many laid off.[87] According to Silver, two thirds of FiveThirtyEight's staff were cut in one day.[88] Since the layoffs, FiveThirtyEight's sports and science coverage has ground to a halt, with the website mostly returning to its roots of exclusive politics coverage.[89][90]\n\nIn May 2023, ABC News hired G. Elliott Morris, a data journalist for The Economist who has often been described as a rival of Silver,[91] to head the site as editorial director of data analytics.[92] At 538, Morris developed a new election forecasting model of the 2024 election. In the leadup to Biden's withdrawal, 538 was the only professional election forecaster to give Biden majority odds of winning the 2024 election.[93] Silver criticized Morris's model, describing it as at best ignoring the polls and giving Biden positive odds merely due to his incumbency, and at worst as being \"buggy\".[93][94] The election forecast remained suspended for a month after Biden withdrew, before being replaced by a new model for Kamala Harris versus Trump that put more emphasis on polling.[95]\n\nRecognition and awards [ edit ]\n\nMascot [ edit ]\n\nFivey Fox is the mascot of FiveThirtyEight.[538 72] This is in reference to a phrase attributed to Archilochus: \"The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing\".[538 67] The name \"Fivey\" is a reference to the website's name, FiveThirtyEight. Fivey Fox is colored orange, white, and beige with comically sized black glasses and has white colored sock-like paws.\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nNotes [ edit ]\n\n^ Several national firms use the name \"Strategic Vision\"; only one has been releasing political polling results to the media. ^ FiveThirtyEight when he made some provocative discoveries of anomalies in the reported results of the 2009 Election in Iran.
