Some of their strategies include setting up fake news sites and targeting government employees and officials.\n\nIran's attempts to meddle in U.S. politics come on top of efforts by groups linked to Russia. But the two countries have notably different approaches, according to Clint Watts, the Center's general manager.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"Russia is very different. They're very focused on shaping the outcome of the election. Iran is focused as much on just breaking the ability of an election to occur,\" he said.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Threat Analysis Center tracks influence operations from foreign operatives, mainly from Russia, Iran and China, and their attempts to interfere with elections and political discourse.\n\nAccording to the Center, Iran has tried to sway American voters in at least the past three election cycles.\n\nIn 2021, the Justice Department charged two suspected Iranian hackers for allegedly sending threatening emails and spreading false information to voters ahead of the 2020 presidential race.\n\n\n\nIranian operatives are behind fake news sites using A.I.\n\nMicrosoft researchers found that an Iranian group, Storm-2035, was behind four websites pretending to be American news outlets. The fake sites cater to both liberal and conservative audiences and amplify polarizing messaging on hot-button issues related to LGBTQ rights and the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nOne fake site, Nio Thinker, was created last year and has been pushing out \"sarcastic, long-winded articles insulting Trump,\" according to the report. Another faux news outlet, called Savannah Time, claimed to be a \"trusted source for conservative news in the vibrant city of Savannah.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"The reason they set those up is because if they do a hacking operation later, they want to have usually \u2014 we believe \u2014 places to drop out the hacked materials and narratives they want to advance,\" Watts said.\n\nResearchers also found evidence indicating that some of these fake sites used AI to rephrase or plagiarize content from actual news outlets.\n\n\n\nIranian hackers target email accounts of campaign advisers and a government employee in a swing state\n\nThis past June, Iranian hackers connected to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), compromised the email account of a former adviser to a U.S. presidential campaign in an attempt to contact a current senior official in that campaign, according to the Microsoft report. That email included a link that would have compromised other accounts.\n\n\"Within days of this activity, the same group unsuccessfully attempted to log into an account belonging to a former presidential candidate,\" the report said.\n\nEarlier in May, another group with links to the IRGC, breached the account of a county-level government employee in a swing state. That compromise was part of \"broader password spray operation\" and the report said it's unclear the motives were election-related.\n\nMicrosoft is a financial supporter of NPR.",

        "text": "About 3 in 4 U.S. adults say the 2024 election will determine the fate of U.S. democracy\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Roughly 3 in 4 American adults believe the upcoming presidential election is vital to the future of U.S. democracy, although which candidate they think poses the greater threat depends on their political leanings, according to a poll.\n\nThe survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that most Democrats, Republicans and independents see the election as \u201cvery important\u201d or \u201cextremely important\u201d to democracy, while Democrats have a higher level of intensity about the issue. More than half of Democrats say the November election is \u201cextremely important\u201d to the future of U.S. democracy, compared to about 4 in 10 independents and Republicans.\n\nDemocrat Pamela Hanson, 67, of Amery, Wisconsin, said she has grave concerns for the future of democracy in the country if Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump gets elected.\n\n\u201cHis statements tend towards him being a king or a dictator, a person in charge by himself,\u201d Hanson said. \u201cI mean, the man is unhinged in my opinion.\u201d\n\nBut Republican Ernie Wagner from Liberty, New York, said it\u2019s President Joe Biden\u2019s administration \u2014 of which Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, is a part \u2014 that has abused the power of the executive branch.\n\n\u201cBiden has tried to erase the student loans, and he\u2019s been told by the courts that it\u2019s unconstitutional to do that,\u201d said Wagner, 85. \u201cHe\u2019s weaponized the FBI to get at his political opponents.\u201d\n\nThe poll findings suggest that many Democrats continue to view Trump as a threat to democracy after he tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election, embraced the rioters who attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and threatened to seek retribution against his opponents if he wins reelection.\n\nBut they also indicate that many of Trump\u2019s supporters agree with him that Biden is the real threat to democracy. Trump and his allies have accused Biden of weaponizing the Justice Department as it has pursued charges against the former president over his effort to halt certification of the 2020 election and keeping classified documents, though there is no evidence Biden has had any involvement or influence in the cases.\n\nTrump has framed himself as a defender of American values and portrayed Biden as a \u201cdestroyer\u201d of democracy. He said multiple times after he survived an assassination attempt last month that he \u201ctook a bullet for democracy.\u201d\n\nThe poll, conducted in the days after Biden dropped out of the race and Harris announced her campaign, is an early glimpse of Americans\u2019 views of a reshaped contest.\n\nMajorities of both Democrats and Republicans say democracy could be at risk in this election depending on who wins the presidency, responses generally in line with the findings when the question was last asked in an AP-NORC poll in December 2023.\n\nHanson, the Wisconsin Democrat, said she worries Trump in a second term would use the conservative-dominated U.S. Supreme Court to overrule important freedoms. She also is concerned that he would fill his Cabinet with loyalists who don\u2019t care about the well-being of everyone in the country and defund agencies that regulate key functions of society.\n\nBut Wagner, the New York Republican, brushed off those concerns and pointed to Trump\u2019s time in office.\n\n\u201cWhen he was in the White House, we had peace, we had prosperity, we had energy independence,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s undemocratic about that?\u201d\n\nHe said he didn\u2019t think Trump\u2019s intentions leading up to and on Jan. 6 were criminal.\n\n\u201cI just think he was misguided,\u201d Wagner said.\n\nSome independents also are carefully considering the stakes of the upcoming election on the country\u2019s democratic future.\n\n\u201cI believe that this is the most important election of my lifetime,\u201d said 53-year-old Patricia Seliga-Williams of LaVale, Maryland, an independent who is leaning toward voting for Harris.\n\nSeliga-Williams said she\u2019s barely scraping by on $15 an hour as a hotel breakfast attendant and remembers Trump handling the economy and immigration well. But she didn\u2019t like it when he recently quipped that he plans to be a \u201cdictator\u201d on day one in office.\n\n\u201cWe all know Donald Trump could run the country,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he\u2019s just too aggressive anymore, and I don\u2019t think I can trust that as a voter.\u201d\n\nNot everyone agrees that this year\u2019s presidential election will be an inflection point for the country\u2019s democracy, offering starkly different reasons, according to the AP-NORC poll. About 2 in 10 Americans say democracy in the U.S. is strong enough to withstand the outcome of the election no matter who wins, while another 2 in 10 believe democracy is already so seriously broken that the outcome doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nThe poll also shows the stakes of democracy in the election are felt more by older adults rather than younger ones. About half of adults 45 and older say the outcome of the election is extremely important for the future of democracy, compared to about 4 in 10 adults under 45.\n\n\u201cMaking the claim that the other candidate is trying to destroy democracy, it doesn\u2019t really land for me,\u201d said Daniel Oliver, 26, an independent from suburban Detroit. \u201cI think that we have things in place that should safeguard against when you kind of play at destroying democracy. We have other branches of government. We have people that believe in voting. So, it would be hard for a candidate to take over and become some kind of dictator.\u201d\n\nHe said he\u2019ll be looking for candidates to talk about issues he\u2019s more interested in, such as reducing inflation and investing in clean energy sources.\n\nBiden and Trump spent months sparring over whose second term would be worse for democracy. The president nodded to the consequences when he ended his campaign last month, saying in his Oval Office address that \u201cthe defense of democracy is more important than any title.\u201d\n\nHarris has focused more on the concept of \u201cfreedom\u201d in the early days of her campaign. She has said Trump\u2019s reelection could result in Americans losing the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence and the freedom for women to make decisions about their own bodies. Her debut campaign ad last month was set to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s 2016 track \u201cFreedom,\u201d and it has become a campaign anthem for her at rallies ever since.\n\nHarris didn\u2019t mention democracy in her first two presidential campaign rallies, but she returned to the topic in remarks to Sigma Gamma Rho sorority members in Houston last week, saying \u201cour fundamental freedoms are on the ballot, and so is our democracy.\u201d\n\nThe poll of 1,143 adults was conducted July 25-29, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC\u2019s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 4.1 percentage points.",

        "text": "Iran is targeting the U.S. election with fake news sites and cyberattacks, Microsoft says\nAlleged Trump campaign hack seems to be Iranian \"replication of 2016 Russian playbook,\" says Krebs\n\nIran is accelerating online activity that appears intended to influence the U.S. election, in one case targeting a presidential campaign with an email phishing attack, Microsoft said Friday.\n\nIranian actors also have spent recent months creating fake news sites and impersonating activists, laying the groundwork to stoke division and potentially sway American voters this fall, especially in swing states, the technology giant found.\n\nThe findings in Microsoft's newest threat intelligence report show how Iran, which has been active in recent U.S. elections, is evolving its tactics for another election that's likely to have global implications. The report goes a step beyond anything U.S. intelligence officials have disclosed, giving specific examples of Iranian groups and the actions they have taken so far. Iran's United Nations mission denied it had plans to interfere or launch cyberattacks in the U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe report doesn't specify Iran's intentions besides sowing chaos in the United States, though U.S. officials have previously hinted that Iran particularly opposes former President Donald Trump. U.S. officials also have expressed alarm about Tehran's efforts to seek retaliation for a 2020 strike on an Iranian general that was ordered by Trump. This week, the Justice Department unsealed criminal charges against a Pakistani man with ties to Iran who's alleged to have hatched assassination plots targeting multiple officials, potentially including Trump.\n\nThe report also reveals how Russia and China are exploiting U.S. political polarization to advance their own divisive messaging in a consequential election year.\n\nMicrosoft's report identified four examples of recent Iranian activity that the company expects to increase as November's election draws closer.\n\nFirst, a group linked to Iran's Revolutionary Guard in June targeted a high-ranking U.S. presidential campaign official with a phishing email, a form of cyberattack often used to gather sensitive information, according to the report, which didn't identify which campaign was targeted. The group concealed the email's origins by sending it from the hacked email account of a former senior adviser, Microsoft said.\n\nDays later, the Iranian group tried to log into an account that belonged to a former presidential candidate, but wasn't successful, Microsoft's report said. The company notified those who were targeted.\n\nIn a separate example, an Iranian group has been creating websites that pose as U.S.-based news sites targeted to voters on opposite sides of the political spectrum, the report said.\n\nOne fake news site that lends itself to a left-leaning audience insults Trump by calling him \"raving mad\" and suggests he uses drugs, the report said. Another site meant to appeal to Republican readers centers on LGBTQ issues and gender-affirming surgery.\n\nA third example Microsoft cited found that Iranian groups are impersonating U.S. activists, potentially laying the groundwork for influence operations closer to the election.\n\nFinally, another Iranian group in May compromised an account owned by a government employee in a swing state, the report said. It was unclear whether that cyberattack was related to election interference efforts.\n\nIran's U.N. mission sent The Associated Press an emailed statement: \"Iran has been the victim of numerous offensive cyber operations targeting its infrastructure, public service centers, and industries. Iran's cyber capabilities are defensive and proportionate to the threats it faces. Iran has neither the intention nor plans to launch cyber attacks. The U.S. presidential election is an internal matter in which Iran does not interfere.\"\n\nThe Microsoft report said that as Iran escalates its cyber influence, Russia-linked actors also have pivoted their influence campaigns to focus on the U.S. election, while actors linked to the Chinese Communist Party have taken advantage of pro-Palestinian university protests and other current events in the U.S. to try to raise U.S. political tensions.\n\nMicrosoft said it has continued to monitor how foreign foes are using generative AI technology. The increasingly cheap and easy-to-access tools can generate lifelike fake images, photos and videos in seconds, prompting concern among some experts that they will be weaponized to mislead voters this election cycle.\n\nWhile many countries have experimented with AI in their influence operations, the company said, those efforts haven't had much impact so far. The report said as a result, some actors have \"pivoted back to techniques that have proven effective in the past - simple digital manipulations, mischaracterization of content, and use of trusted labels or logos atop false information.\"\n\nMicrosoft's report aligns with recent warnings from U.S. intelligence officials, who say America's adversaries appear determined to seed the internet with false and incendiary claims ahead of November's vote.\n\nTop intelligence officials said last month that Russia continues to pose the greatest threat when it comes to election disinformation, while there are indications that Iran is expanding its efforts and China is proceeding cautiously when it comes to 2024.\n\nIran's efforts seem aimed at undermining candidates seen as being more likely to increase tension with Tehran, the officials said. That's a description that fits Trump, whose administration ended a nuclear deal with Iran, reimposed sanctions and ordered the killing of the top Iranian general.\n\nAn update last month from officials with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), FBI and Department of Homeland Security concluded that Tehran's efforts appeared designed to undercut Trump.\n\n\"Since our last update, the [intelligence community] has observed Tehran working to influence the presidential election, probably because Iranian leaders want to avoid an outcome they perceive would increase tensions with the United States,\" a senior ODNI official said, adding, \"Iran's preference is essentially a reflection of its desire to not worsen tensions with the United States, and Iran is opposing the candidate that Iran's leaders perceive would increase those tensions.\"\n\nThe officials did not explicitly name the Trump campaign and referred instead to the key findings of the 2020 assessment. They also stressed that most of Iran's online activities, which they said rely on a \"vast web\" of internet personas, have been focused on stoking chaos and societal divisions.\n\nThe influence efforts also coincide with a time of high tensions between Iran and Israel, whose military the U.S. strongly supports.\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Avril Haines said last month that the Iranian government has covertly supported American protests over Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza. In the statement, issued on July 9, Haines said the intelligence community had \"observed actors tied to Iran's government posing as activists online seeking to encourage protests and even providing financial support to protesters.\"\n\nAmerica's foes, Iran among them, have a long history of seeking to influence U.S. elections. In 2020, groups linked to Iran sent emails to Democratic voters in an apparent effort to intimidate them into voting for Trump, intelligence officials said.",

        "text": "Iran Targeting 2024 US Election\nToday we\u2019re sharing intelligence about activity we\u2019ve been tracking that increasingly points to Iran\u2019s intent to influence this year\u2019s US presidential election. In recent weeks, groups connected with the Iranian government have upped two kinds of activity. First, they\u2019ve laid the groundwork for influence campaigns on trending election-related topics and begun to activate these campaigns in an apparent effort to stir up controversy or sway voters \u2013 especially in swing states. Second, they\u2019ve launched operations that Microsoft assesses are designed to gain intelligence on political campaigns and help enable them to influence the elections in the future.\n\nWe discuss this activity in a new report we released today, which details this activity, and four examples illuminate what we can increasingly expect from Iran as we near November.\n\nOne Iranian group has been launching covert news sites targeting US voter groups on opposing ends of the political spectrum. One of the sites, called Nio Thinker, caters to left-leaning audiences and insults former president Donald Trump, calling him an \u201copioid-pilled elephant in the MAGA china shop\u201d and a \u201craving mad litigiosaur.\u201d Another, called Savannah Time, claims to be a \u201ctrusted source for conservative news in the vibrant city of Savannah\u201d and focuses on topics including LGBTQ+ issues and gender reassignment. The evidence we found suggests the sites are using AI-enabled services to plagiarize at least some of their content from US publications.\n\nA separate Iranian group has been setting the groundwork for US-focused influence operations since March. We believe this group may be setting itself up for activities that are even more extreme, including intimidation or inciting violence against political figures or groups, with the ultimate goals of inciting chaos, undermining authorities, and sowing doubt about election integrity.\n\nYet another Iranian group, this one connected with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC, sent a spear phishing email in June to a high-ranking official on a presidential campaign from the compromised email account of a former senior advisor. The email contained a link that would direct traffic through a domain controlled by the group before routing to the website of the provided link. Within days of this activity, the same group unsuccessfully attempted to log into an account belonging to a former presidential candidate. We\u2019ve since notified those targeted.\n\nA fourth Iranian group compromised an account of a county-level government employee in a swing state. The compromise was part of a broader password spray operation and Microsoft Threat Intelligence did not observe the actor gain additional access beyond the single account, making it hard to discern the group\u2019s ultimate objectives. Since early 2023, the group\u2019s operations have focused on strategic intelligence collection particularly in satellite, defense, and health sectors with some targeting of US government organizations, often in swing states.\n\nThe Microsoft Threat Intelligence Report we\u2019re releasing today is from the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center, or MTAC, which tracks influence operations from specific nation-state groups around the world. MTAC routinely tracks threats to elections as part of Microsoft\u2019s broader Democracy Forward work and this builds on work the team did to track threats to recent elections in India, the UK, and France. Today\u2019s update also includes activity we have observed by actors advancing the geopolitical goals of Russia and China, each to varying degrees of effectiveness.\n\nWe share intelligence like this so voters, government institutions, candidates, parties, and others can be aware of influence campaigns and protect themselves from threats. We\u2019ve also been training candidates and parties involved in elections this year, building on our longstanding offerings, like AccountGuard. Finally, Microsoft will not endorse a candidate or political party. Our goal in releasing these reports is to underscore the importance of combating election deepfakes and promoting education and learning about possible foreign interference.\n\nTags: AI, Iran, MTAC",

Neither site has gained much traction on social media, but that could change as the election draws nearer, according to Microsoft.\n\nThe report \u2013 compiled from open-source materials and Microsoft\u2019s vast supply of internal data \u2013 offers some of the clearest public examples yet of what US intelligence officials described last month as an ongoing covert social media campaign by Iran to undercut Trump\u2019s candidacy and to increase \u201csocial discord\u201d in the US ahead of the November election.\n\nThe report also underscores how the number of foreign actors trying to sow divisions around US elections has continued to grow since the Kremlin\u2019s sweeping effort to influence the 2016 election.\n\nThe Iranians have \u201claid the groundwork for influence campaigns on trending election-related topics and begun to activate these campaigns in an apparent effort to stir up controversy or sway voters \u2013 especially in swing states,\u201d Clint Watts, general manager of the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center, said in a blog post.\n\nA hacking group linked with Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in June also tried to break into the email account of a high-ranking official on a US presidential campaign, according to Microsoft.\n\nMicrosoft said it notified the campaign of the hacking attempt, but declined to say publicly which campaign it was.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft has not notified us of any campaign accounts having been targeted in this manner,\u201d an official with Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 campaign told CNN. CNN has requested comment from the Trump campaign.\n\nRussian operatives, meanwhile, have since April, tried to \u201cdrive headlines with fake scandals\u201d that falsely claim that the CIA told a Ukrainian troll farm to disrupt the upcoming US election, that the FBI wiretapped Trump\u2019s residence and that Ukrainian soldiers burned an effigy of Trump, according to Microsoft.\n\nChinese online personas have tried to use hundreds of thousands of online accounts to amplify outrage around the pro-Palestinian protests at US universities this spring, the Microsoft report said.\n\nThe Iranian, Russian and Chinese governments routinely deny allegations of election influence operations.\n\nIt is not unusual during US presidential campaigns for hackers associated with the Iranian, Russian and Chinese intelligence services to try to collect intelligence on campaign positions or personnel. In 2020, Microsoft warned that the same group of Iranian hackers was targeting Trump\u2019s reelection campaign, while Chinese hackers were targeting associates of Joe Biden\u2019s campaign.\n\nEfforts to undermine US election loom\n\nUS officials are bracing for a range for foreign intelligence services to try to influence or undermine confidence in the 2024 US elections by exploiting an already-fraught domestic environment in which many Americans believe lies about voter fraud.\n\nRussia \u201cremains the predominant threat to U.S. elections,\u201d the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said in a recent assessment. US officials have also warned that Russian operatives and propagandists are planning to \u201ccovertly use social media\u201d in an attempt to undermine support for Ukraine in swing states during the election.\n\nChina \u201cprobably does not plan to influence the outcome\u201d of the US presidential election, but US intelligence is monitoring the possibility that China-linked propagandists and influence actors could \u201cdenigrate down-ballot candidates,\u201d the ODNI assessment states.\n\nThe alleged Iranian threats to the Trump candidacy have not just been online.\n\nUS authorities obtained intelligence from a human source in recent weeks on a plot by Iran to try to assassinate Trump, a development that led to the Secret Service increasing security around the former president, CNN first reported on July 16. The Justice Department on August 6 announced charges against a Pakistani man with alleged ties to the Iranian government for allegedly seeking to carry out political assassinations.\n\nIran has denied the assassination plot allegations.\n\nAs president, Trump ordered the killing of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, and he withdrew from a multilateral deal aimed at curbing Tehran\u2019s nuclear program.

        "text": "Majority of US adults say democracy is on the ballot but they differ on the threat: AP-NORC poll\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Roughly 3 in 4 American adults believe the upcoming presidential election is vital to the future of U.S. democracy, although which candidate they think poses the greater threat depends on their political leanings, according to a poll.\n\nFILE \u2013 Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump and Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, arrive a campaign rally, July 20, 2024, in Grand Rapids, Mich. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) FILE \u2013 Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz arrive at a campaign rally in Philadelphia, Aug. 6, 2024. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke)\n\nThe survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that most Democrats, Republicans and independents see the election as \u201cvery important\u201d or \u201cextremely important\u201d to democracy, while Democrats have a higher level of intensity about the issue. More than half of Democrats say the November election is \u201cextremely important\u201d to the future of U.S. democracy, compared to about 4 in 10 independents and Republicans.\n\nDemocrat Pamela Hanson, 67, of Amery, Wisconsin, said she has grave concerns for the future of democracy in the country if Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump gets elected.\n\n\u201cHis statements tend towards him being a king or a dictator, a person in charge by himself,\u201d Hanson said. \u201cI mean, the man is unhinged in my opinion.\u201d\n\nBut Republican Ernie Wagner from Liberty, New York, said it\u2019s President Joe Biden\u2019s administration \u2014 of which Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, is a part \u2014 that has abused the power of the executive branch.\n\n\u201cBiden has tried to erase the student loans, and he\u2019s been told by the courts that it\u2019s unconstitutional to do that,\u201d said Wagner, 85. \u201cHe\u2019s weaponized the FBI to get at his political opponents.\u201d\n\nThe poll findings suggest that many Democrats continue to view Trump as a threat to democracy after he tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election, embraced the rioters who attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and threatened to seek retribution against his opponents if he wins reelection.\n\nBut they also indicate that many of Trump\u2019s supporters agree with him that Biden is the real threat to democracy. Trump and his allies have accused Biden of weaponizing the Justice Department as it has pursued charges against the former president over his effort to halt certification of the 2020 election and keeping classified documents, though there is no evidence Biden has had any involvement or influence in the cases.\n\nTrump has framed himself as a defender of American values and portrayed Biden as a \u201cdestroyer\u201d of democracy. He said multiple times after he survived an assassination attempt last month that he \u201ctook a bullet for democracy.\u201d\n\nThe poll, conducted in the days after Biden dropped out of the race and Harris announced her campaign, is an early glimpse of Americans\u2019 views of a reshaped contest.\n\nMajorities of both Democrats and Republicans say democracy could be at risk in this election depending on who wins the presidency, responses generally in line with the findings when the question was last asked in an AP-NORC poll in December 2023.\n\nHanson, the Wisconsin Democrat, said she worries Trump in a second term would use the conservative-dominated U.S. Supreme Court to overrule important freedoms. She also is concerned that he would fill his Cabinet with loyalists who don\u2019t care about the well-being of everyone in the country and defund agencies that regulate key functions of society.\n\nBut Wagner, the New York Republican, brushed off those concerns and pointed to Trump\u2019s time in office.\n\n\u201cWhen he was in the White House, we had peace, we had prosperity, we had energy independence,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s undemocratic about that?\u201d\n\nHe said he didn\u2019t think Trump\u2019s intentions leading up to and on Jan. 6 were criminal.\n\n\u201cI just think he was misguided,\u201d Wagner said.\n\nSome independents also are carefully considering the stakes of the upcoming election on the country\u2019s democratic future.\n\n\u201cI believe that this is the most important election of my lifetime,\u201d said 53-year-old Patricia Seliga-Williams of LaVale, Maryland, an independent who is leaning toward voting for Harris.\n\nSeliga-Williams said she\u2019s barely scraping by on $15 an hour as a hotel breakfast attendant and remembers Trump handling the economy and immigration well. But she didn\u2019t like it when he recently quipped that he plans to be a \u201cdictator\u201d on day one in office.\n\n\u201cWe all know Donald Trump could run the country,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he\u2019s just too aggressive anymore, and I don\u2019t think I can trust that as a voter.\u201d\n\nNot everyone agrees that this year\u2019s presidential election will be an inflection point for the country\u2019s democracy, offering starkly different reasons, according to the AP-NORC poll. About 2 in 10 Americans say democracy in the U.S. is strong enough to withstand the outcome of the election no matter who wins, while another 2 in 10 believe democracy is already so seriously broken that the outcome doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nThe poll also shows the stakes of democracy in the election are felt more by older adults rather than younger ones. About half of adults 45 and older say the outcome of the election is extremely important for the future of democracy, compared to about 4 in 10 adults under 45.\n\n\u201cMaking the claim that the other candidate is trying to destroy democracy, it doesn\u2019t really land for me,\u201d said Daniel Oliver, 26, an independent from suburban Detroit. \u201cI think that we have things in place that should safeguard against when you kind of play at destroying democracy. We have other branches of government. We have people that believe in voting. So, it would be hard for a candidate to take over and become some kind of dictator.\u201d\n\nHe said he\u2019ll be looking for candidates to talk about issues he\u2019s more interested in, such as reducing inflation and investing in clean energy sources.\n\nBiden and Trump spent months sparring over whose second term would be worse for democracy. The president nodded to the consequences when he ended his campaign last month, saying in his Oval Office address that \u201cthe defense of democracy is more important than any title.\u201d\n\nHarris has focused more on the concept of \u201cfreedom\u201d in the early days of her campaign. She has said Trump\u2019s reelection could result in Americans losing the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence and the freedom for women to make decisions about their own bodies. Her debut campaign ad last month was set to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s 2016 track \u201cFreedom,\u201d and it has become a campaign anthem for her at rallies ever since.\n\nHarris didn\u2019t mention democracy in her first two presidential campaign rallies, but she returned to the topic in remarks to Sigma Gamma Rho sorority members in Houston last week, saying \u201cour fundamental freedoms are on the ballot, and so is our democracy.\u201d\n\n___\n\nThe poll of 1,143 adults was conducted July 25-29, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC\u2019s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 4.1 percentage points.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

        "text": "US election 2024: Trump, Harris to face off in TV debate on September 10\nThe ABC network confirms the two US presidential candidates will attend the debate.\n\nRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his Democratic rival Kamala Harris will attend a debate on September 10, the ABC network in the United States has confirmed.\n\nIn a news conference at his Palm Beach, Florida, residence on Thursday, Trump said he wanted additional debates on September 4 and 25 as well.\n\nHe did not detail specific terms, including whether there would be an audience, and it was not immediately clear whether his campaign had made a proposal to Harris\u2019s camp.\n\nThe Harris campaign did not immediately comment.\n\nTrump had previously suggested he might back out of the ABC debate, which was scheduled before Vice President Harris replaced President Joe Biden as the Democratic presidential candidate less than three weeks ago, upending the contest.\n\nThe news conference was Trump\u2019s first public appearance since Harris selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate on Tuesday.\n\nABC News will host qualifying presidential candidates to debate on September 10 on @ABC. Vice President Harris and former President Trump have both confirmed they will attend the ABC debate. https://t.co/DEBOGC2ovO pic.twitter.com/t0KAWpcYOY \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) August 8, 2024\n\nHarris and Walz have headlined rallies in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin this week, drawing tens of thousands of attendees in a new sign of how her late entry into the race has energised Democrats.\n\nHer rapid rise has sent Trump\u2019s team scrambling to recalibrate their strategy and messaging. Opinion polls suggest Harris has erased \u2013 or at least shrunk \u2013 the lead Trump had built over Biden.\n\nDemocrats have also raked in hundreds of millions of dollars from voters and big donors in a matter of weeks.\n\nAsked on Thursday how he has altered his approach to the new challenge from Harris, Trump insisted he has not done so.\n\nIn a question-and-answer session with reporters that stretched longer than an hour, Trump moved from topic to topic, claiming Harris and Walz were weak candidates who were already dropping in the polls.\n\nDespite that, he lamented that he would not be able to face Biden in the election, suggesting that the president was a victim of an unconstitutional plot to dislodge him from atop the Democratic ticket.\n\nBiden, 81, dropped his faltering re-election bid under pressure from fellow Democrats worried about his chances of victory in the November 5 election after a disastrous debate performance against Trump.\n\nReporting from Washington, DC, Al Jazeera\u2019s Rob Reynolds said Trump has been attacking Harris\u2019s intelligence while pushing on with his usual anti-immigration rhetoric.\n\n\u201cThere were certainly a lot of familiar sort of rancorous remarks in this press conference about crowd size,\u201d Reynolds said. \u201cThe Republican candidate Donald Trump seemed to get very, very upset when there was some suggestion that Kamla Harris was drawing large crowds. So he went on an extended riff about that.\u201d\n\nEchoing a recent criticism from his campaign, Trump criticised Harris on Thursday for not doing a news interview since launching her campaign.\n\n\u201cShe can\u2019t do an interview. She\u2019s barely competent,\u201d Trump said, later again calling her \u201cnasty\u201d, a go-to line that he often uses to disparage female critics.\n\nTrump has conducted a steady stream of media interviews, though many are usually with friendly, right-leaning outlets and reporters. On Wednesday, he called into the Fox & Friends morning programme and took questions from the hosts.\n\nHarris and Walz were meeting with autoworkers in Detroit on Thursday, following the United Auto Workers union\u2019s endorsement of their candidacy, as part of a push to mobilise blue-collar workers in key battleground states.\n\nThe Harris campaign cancelled events on Thursday in North Carolina and on Friday in Georgia, where Tropical Storm Debby is bringing heavy rain and dangerous flooding. The Democrats will head to Arizona and Nevada later this week, visiting two more swing states likely to play a key role in the election.\n\nTrump\u2019s running mate, Senator JD Vance of Ohio, also cancelled campaign events in North Carolina on Thursday due to the storm. He has spent the last few days trailing Harris and Walz around the country, an unusual move intended to provide a \u201ccontrast\u201d, he told reporters on Wednesday.",

        "text": "Iran hackers target US officials to influence election, Microsoft says\nMicrosoft researchers said on Friday that Iran government-tied hackers tried breaking into the account of a \u201chigh-ranking official\u201d on the US presidential campaign in June, weeks after breaching the account of a county-level US official.\n\nThe breaches were part of Iranian groups\u2019 increasing attempts to influence the US presidential election in November, the researchers said in a report that did not provide any further detail on the apparent official in question.\n\nThe report follows recent statements by senior US intelligence officials that they had seen Iran ramp up use of clandestine social media accounts with the aim to use them to try to sow political discord in the US.\n\nThe report also reveals how Russia and China are exploiting US political polarization to advance their own divisive messaging in a consequential election year.\n\nIran\u2019s mission to the UN in New York told Reuters in a statement that its cyber capabilities were \u201cdefensive and proportionate to the threats it faces\u201d and that it had no plans to launch cyber-attacks.\n\n\u201cThe US presidential election is an internal matter in which Iran does not interfere,\u201d the mission added in response to the allegations in the Microsoft report.\n\nThe report said: \u201cA group run by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) intelligence unit sent a spear-phishing email to a high-ranking official of a presidential campaign\u201d and \u201canother group with assessed links to the IRGC compromised a user account with minimal access permissions at a county-level government\u201d.\n\nIt said the activity appeared part of a broader push by Iranian groups to gain intelligence on US political campaigns and target US swing states. It said the county employee\u2019s account was breached in May as part of a wider \u201cpassword spray operation\u201d \u2013 one where hackers use common or leaked passwords en masse on many accounts until they can break into one.\n\nThe hackers were not able to access any other accounts through that breach and the targets were notified, the report added.\n\nThe report does not specify Iran\u2019s intentions besides sowing chaos in the US, though US officials have previously hinted that Iran particularly opposes the former president and Republican nominee Donald Trump over his Democratic party rival, Kamala Harris.\n\nThe researchers also said another Iranian group had been launching covert news sites that used artificial intelligence to lift content from legitimate news sites, and targeted US voters on opposite sides of the political spectrum. It named the two sites as Nio Thinker \u2013 a left-leaning site \u2013 and a conservative site called Savannah Time.\n\nWhen browsed on Friday, both websites had similar formats on their About Us page, and neither listed any contact detail. Nio Thinker calls itself \u201cyour go-to destination for insightful, progressive news and analysis that challenges the status quo\u201d, while Savannah Time says it is \u201ca reflection of the values that make Savannah unique\u201d and a place \u201cwhere conservative values meet local insight\u201d.\n\nThe Microsoft report said that as Iran escalates its cyber influence, Russia-linked actors also have pivoted their influence campaigns to focus on the US election, while actors linked to the Chinese Communist party have taken advantage of pro-Palestinian university protests and other current events in the US to try to raise US political tensions.\n\nMicrosoft said it had continued to monitor how foreign foes are using generative AI technology. The increasingly cheap and easy-to-access tools can generate lifelike fake images, photos and videos in seconds, prompting concern among some experts that they will be weaponized to mislead voters this election cycle.\n\nReuters and the Associated Press contributed reporting",

        "text": "Microsoft: Iran Trying to Influence U.S. Election\nGroups linked to Iran\u2019s government have stepped up efforts to interfere in the 2024 U.S. election, according to a Microsoft report released on Aug. 9, 2024. They have spread disinformation and polarizing messages using covert news sites and social media. The goal appeared to be to sow chaos and undermine trust in authorities and elections. Also, a hacking group managed by the Revolutionary Guards intelligence unit sent a spear-phishing email to a high-ranking official of a presidential campaign.\n\nIn July 2024, U.S. intelligence had reported that Iran was running influence operations to undermine former President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign. Tehran was \u201cworking to influence the presidential election, probably because Iranian leaders want to avoid an outcome they perceive would increase tensions with the United States,\u201d the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said in a statement. The following are excerpts from the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Report.\n\nIran steps into US election 2024 with cyber-enabled influence operations\n\nForeign malign influence concerning the 2024 US election started off slowly but has steadily picked up pace over the last six months due initially to Russian operations, but more recently from Iranian activity. This third election report from the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center (MTAC) provides an update on what we\u2019ve observed from Russia, Iran, and China since our second report in April 2024, \u201cNation-states engage in US-focused influence operations ahead of US presidential election.\u201d\n\nOver the past several months, we have seen the emergence of significant influence activity by Iranian actors. Iranian cyber-enabled influence operations have been a consistent feature of at least the last three US election cycles. Iran\u2019s operations have been notable and distinguishable from Russian campaigns for appearing later in the election season and employing cyberattacks more geared toward election conduct than swaying voters. Recent activity suggests the Iranian regime\u2014along with the Kremlin\u2014may be equally engaged in election 2024.\n\nIran enters the fold with cyber-influence operations starting June 2024\n\nIranian actors have recently laid the groundwork for influence operations aimed at US audiences and potentially seeking to impact the 2024 US presidential election. This recent cyber-enabled influence activity arises from a combination of actors which are conducting initial cyber reconnaissance and seeding online personas and websites into the information space.\n\nCyber-enabled influence operations aimed at US and other global elections have been a persistent target for Iran in recent years. As we noted in our first elections report last November 2023, \u201cduring the 2020 US presidential election, Iran launched multiple cyber-enabled influence operations that impersonated American extremists, and attempted to sow discord among US voters and incite violence against US government officials. Since 2020, Iran extended its track record of election meddling, amplifying cyberattacks with parallel online influence operations in Bahrain and Israel.\u201d As seen in Figure 1 below, Iran has employed fabricated media, impersonations and in many cases cyberattacks throughout the last four years targeting the US, Bahrain, and Israel.\n\nLooking forward, we expect Iranian actors will employ cyberattacks against institutions and candidates while simultaneously intensifying their efforts to amplify existing divisive issues within the US, like racial tensions, economic disparities, and gender-related issues. Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen thus far in 2024 from Iranian actors with respect to the upcoming US election.\n\nSefid Flood prepares for possible influence operations\n\nSefid Flood, an Iran-linked influence actor, began staging for influence operations in the 2024 US elections following the Iranian New Year in late March. Sefid Flood specializes in impersonating social and political activist groups in a target audience to stoke chaos, undermine trust in authorities, and sow doubt about election integrity. This group\u2019s operations may go as far as intimidation, doxing, or violent incitement targeting political figures or social/political groups.\n\nIRGC threat actors enter preparatory stage for likely cyber-enabled influence\n\nIn June 2024, Mint Sandstorm\u2014a group run by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) intelligence unit\u2014sent a spear-phishing email to a high-ranking official of a presidential campaign from a compromised email account of a former senior advisor. The phishing email contained a fake forward with a hyperlink that directs traffic through an actor-controlled domain before redirecting to the listed domain. Mint Sandstorm similarly targeted a presidential campaign in May and June 2020 five to six months ahead of the last US presidential election.\n\nOn June 13, Mint Sandstorm also unsuccessfully attempted to log in to an account belonging to a former presidential candidate. Mint Sandstorm\u2019s target selection and timing\u2014days prior to phishing an active presidential campaign and months ahead of the election\u2014suggest their attempted authentication may also be election-related. Given Mint Sandstorm\u2019s regular targeting of senior political officials for intelligence collection unrelated to elections, additional evidence is required to make a determination. Regardless of the intent, this targeting is a reminder that senior policymakers should be cognizant of monitoring and following cybersecurity best practices even for legacy or archived infrastructure, as they can be ripe targets for threat actors seeking to collect intelligence, run cyber-enabled influence operations, or both.\n\nIn May, Peach Sandstorm (a.k.a. APT-33)\u2014another group with assessed links to the IRGC\u2014compromised a user account with minimal access permissions at a county-level government in a swing state. The compromise was part of a broader password spray operation from the group, and Microsoft Threat Intelligence did not observe any lateral movement or privilege escalation, making it difficult to determine whether it was election-related. While unclear if related, it is worth noting that the targeted county had undergone a race-related controversy that made national news this year. Since early 2023, Peach Sandstorm\u2019s operations have focused on strategic intelligence collection particularly in satellite, defense, and pharmaceutical sectors with some targeting of US government organizations, often in swing states.\n\nIran-run covert news sites target US voter groups\n\nAn Iranian network, Storm-2035, comprising four websites masquerading as news outlets is actively engaging US voter groups on opposing ends of the political spectrum with polarizing messaging on issues such as the US presidential candidates, LGBTQ rights, and the Israel-Hamas conflict. This group is part of a broader campaign that has been operating since at least 2020 and includes over a dozen covert news sites targeting French, Spanish, Arabic, and English-speaking audiences with social and political content.\n\nIn 2022, Mandiant reported on one of the news sites, EvenPolitics, noting that the site had published articles discussing the 2022 US midterm elections. An inauthentic amplification network promoting the website was taken down by the X platform in 2022, but the site remains active, publishing around ten articles a week.\n\nA more recently created site, Nio Thinker, first began publishing in late October 2023. The site\u2019s early publications focused on the Israel-Hamas conflict, but have increasingly shifted to the US elections in recent months. Its content caters to liberal audiences and includes sarcastic, long-winded articles insulting Trump including calling him an \u201copioid-pilled elephant in the MAGA china shop\u201d and a \u201craving mad litigiosaur\u201d1 (see Figure 2).\n\nAnother site, Savannah Time, claims to be a \u201ctrusted source for conservative news in the vibrant city of Savannah.\u201d The site focuses heavily on Republican politics and LGBTQ issues, particularly gender re-assignment. MTAC has not observed significant social media amplification of these sites as of yet, though it is possible they will begin closer to election day.\n\nMTAC found evidence indicating the sites are using AI-enabled services to plagiarize at least some of their content from US publications. Examination of webpage source code and indicators in the articles themselves suggest the sites\u2019 operators are likely using SEO plugins and other generative AI-based tools to create article titles, keywords, and to automatically rephrase stolen content in a way that drives search engine traffic to their sites while obfuscating the content\u2019s original source.",

        "text": "Election 2024: Where the Presidential Race Stands Three Months Before Election Day\nElection Day is just under three months away. The first early voting begins in just six weeks. So where do things stand?\n\nFive things are worth noting.\n\n1. The race remains tight. The RealClear average of national polls has Kamala Harris up by half a percentage point over Donald Trump. That\u2019s better than where Democrats were three weeks ago, when Trump led by slightly more than three points. However, it is well below where Democrats were four years ago, when Joe Biden led Trump by nearly seven points at this stage in the race. The fact that Harris lags Biden\u2019s 2020 standing suggests that she still needs to make up ground. The Electoral College favors Republican candidates because rural red-leaning states have a disproportionate share of votes. A Democratic presidential candidate likely needs to build a three-percentage point lead in the national polls before their chance of winning the Electoral College tops 50 percent.\n\nThe Water's Edge James M.

Bush famously called it the \u201cBig Mo\u201d\u2014big momentum. Right now, Democrats look to have it. Harris\u2019s slight lead over Trump in the average of national polls may understate things; polls are lagging indicators because it takes time to conduct them and prepare the results. Moreover, Harris is doing well in the battleground states that will decide the election. She is also seeing contributions flood into her campaign coffers and supporters lining up to attend her campaign events. Harris\u2019s momentum could even increase. The Democratic National Convention opens in ten days. She should have an unparalleled opportunity to make the case for her candidacy to the nation. The problem with momentum, however, is that it can be fickle. Just ask Republicans. They left their national convention three weeks ago talking about running away with the presidential election. That talk has stopped.\n\n3. Personalities, not policies, continue to dominate the campaign. Some presidential campaigns have defining issues. It might be Social Security. Or the national debt. Or tax rates. Or war. Election 2024 has yet to produce a defining issue, though abortion, immigration, and jobs are contenders. The Republican Party platform is long on slogans and short on specific policy prescriptions. Trump has disavowed Project 2025, which purported to lay out the agenda for a Trump presidency. Given its late start, the Harris-Walz campaign has stressed big themes like \u201cfreedom\u201d and \u201cfighting\u201d for the American people, not specific governing priorities and choices. That could change in the coming weeks. But talk about which candidate is \u201cdumb\u201d or \u201cweird\u201d looks likely to dominate the political conversation.\n\n4. Foreign policy remains an afterthought. The United States faces a slew of challenges overseas. China, the war in Ukraine, and a possible regional war in the Middle East lead the list. Each of these issues and others are top priorities for some groups of voters. But neither Harris nor Trump is saying much beyond generalities about the U.S. role in the world. That doesn\u2019t mean that the outcome of the U.S. election won\u2019t have a major impact on U.S. foreign policy. To the contrary, Harris and Trump would likely approach the world very differently.\n\n5. Wildcards abound. July showed us how unpredictable the future can be. A lone gunman shot Trump. Biden quit the race. The stock market peaked and talk of recession revived. A misguided software update upended global travel. So events over the next ninety days could change the course of the electoral conversation. But the wildcards don\u2019t end there. We don\u2019t know how accurate the polls are. Or whether third-party candidates will continue to fade as factors in the race. Or who will turn out to vote. Or how the efforts in red states to make voting more secure (in the eyes of supporters)\u2014or to suppress the Democratic vote (in the eyes of opponents)\u2014will play out. Or whether America\u2019s election infrastructure will stand up to what could potentially be another record turnout coupled with possible renewed efforts to intimidate the vote counters.\n\nSo buckle up. It could be a turbulent next three months.\n\nCampaign Update\n\nHarris is now the official Democratic presidential nominee and not just the presumptive nominee. The Democratic Party wrapped up five days of online voting on Monday. Harris picked up 99 percent of the delegates\u2019 votes. The vote ensures that Harris will meet the qualifying requirements in all fifty states for appearing on the ballot. As a result of the virtual vote, the roll-call vote at the Democratic National Convention in thirteen days will be symbolic rather than substantive.\n\nWill we see a Harris-Trump debate? The answer seems to be yes, but some details remain to be worked out. At a press conference at Mar-a-Lago yesterday, Trump said there would be three presidential debates\u2014one on Fox on September 4, one on ABC on September 10, and one on NBC on September 25. (Trump confused when ABC and NBC might host debates, which his campaign subsequently corrected.) Harris has said she is willing to debate Trump on September 10, as Biden had agreed to do. So far, however, she has only said that she is \u201chappy to have that conversation\u201d about possible additional debates. Beyond that, the rules for the potential Fox and NBC debates have yet to be set.\n\nWhat the Candidates Are Saying\n\nTrump\u2019s impromptu press conference at Mar-a-Lago yesterday covered a lot of ground. As is often the case with Trump, much of what he said wasn\u2019t true. Harris\u2019s ascension to the Democratic nomination is not \u201cunconstitutional\u201d as Trump himself later seemed to acknowledge. The \u201cvast majority of the country\u201d does not in fact \u201csupport\u201d him. It is not the case that \u201cnot one American soldier was shot at or killed\u201d in Afghanistan in 2020 as he negotiated with the Taliban. The rally he held on January 6, 2021 did not draw larger crowds than Martin Luther King\u2019s famous 1963 \u201cI-Have-A-Dream\u201d speech. Trump did not fly on a helicopter with California powerbroker Willie Brown that nearly crashed.\n\nAlthough Trump largely ignored substantive policy issues, he did make news on one issue. He argued that \u201cthe president should have at least a say\u201d on setting interest rates because he personally would \u201chave a better instinct than, in many cases, people that would be on the Federal Reserve\u2014or the chairman.\u201d Placing decisions about interest-rate policy in the hands of the president probably belongs in the Hall of Fame of bad public-policy pronouncements. The Fed is independent for a reason. All presidents would have an incentive to use interest-rate policy to advance their political interests rather than the national interest.\n\nPro-Palestinian protesters tried to interrupt Harris as she spoke at a campaign rally in Detroit on Wednesday. She countered by saying: \u201cIf you want Trump to win, then say that.\u201d That remark brought the crowd to its feet.\n\nEarlier in the day, Harris met with a group of activists that included leaders of the effort to press the Biden administration to change its policy toward the war in Gaza. The Harris campaign subsequently released a statement that \u201cin this brief engagement,\u201d the vice president \u201creaffirmed that her campaign will continue to engage with those communities.\u201d One of the steps that the pro-Palestinian activists urged Harris to take is to embargo arms destined for Israel. Yesterday, Harris\u2019s national security advisor, Phil Gordon, tweeted that Harris \u201cwill always ensure Israel is able to defend itself against Iran and Iran-backed terrorist groups. She does not support an arms embargo on Israel. She will continue to work to protect civilians in Gaza and to uphold international humanitarian law.\u201d\n\nJD Vance accused Tim Walz of dodging a deployment with the Minnesota National Guard to Iraq and embellishing his military service, calling it \u201cstolen valor garbage.\u201d The first charge is dubious, the second makes a mountain out of a molehill. Walz retired from the Minnesota National Guard in May 2005 after twenty-four years of service, and months before his unit received official deployment orders for Iraq. (It\u2019s not clear when Walz submitted his papers requesting retirement.) Walz has said he decided to retire to focus on running for Congress. He filed his papers to do so in February 2005. The following month, the Pentagon indicated that the Minnesota National Guard would likely deploy to Iraq sometime in the next two years.\n\nThe embellishment charge turns on the proper way to refer to Walz\u2019s military rank and whether he encouraged voters to believe he served in combat. Walz reached the rank of command sergeant major, but he officially retired with the lower rank of master sergeant because he didn\u2019t complete the paperwork necessary to hold the rank in retirement. So, while it is correct to say that Walz reached the rank of command master sergeant or was a command master sergeant, it is incorrect to say he is a retired command sergeant major. The Harris campaign initially described Walz that way, which it has since changed in his online biography.\n\nAside from that controversy, Republicans have noted that Walz said at a gubernatorial campaign event in 2018 that \u201cwe can make sure those weapons of war that I carried in war\u201d are not flooding America\u2019s cities. Walz never served in combat. However, he did deploy to Italy in 2003 in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, the U.S. invasion of Iraq. More generally, Walz has downplayedhis National Guard service, saying: \u201cThere are certainly folks that did far more than I did. I know that.\u201d And while Walz never saw combat during his time in the Minnesota National Guard, Democrats (and journalists) have pointed out that neither did Vance in his time in the Marine Corps. While the Republican vice-presidential nominee did deploy to Iraq for six months, he did so as a reporter in a public affairs unit and not as a frontline fighter. In all, the military-service flap appears to be what the Wall Street Journal editorial page today called \u201cthin gruel.\u201d Both Walz and Vance served their country honorably.\n\nWhat the Pundits Are Saying\n\nMark Hannah and Rachel Rizzo wrote in Foreign Policy that a Harris-Walz administration has the opportunity to make U.S. foreign policy less militaristic. Hannah and Rizzo contend that \u201cWalz may help Harris reinvest in diplomacy and abandon America\u2019s reflex for world-saving military interventionism. He ran for Congress in 2006 on opposition to the Iraq War, later led a group of Democrats urging then-President Barack Obama to abstain from war with Syria, and was an early co-sponsor of a war powers resolution that tried to end U.S. troop involvement in Saudi Arabia\u2019s war in Yemen. He was also a vocal supporter of the Iran deal and saw the mutual benefits of opening up trade between Cuba and the United States.\u201d\n\nWashington Post reporters gained access to texts between JD Vance and a far-right conspiracy figure named Charles Johnson. According to the report, \u201ctheir correspondence over\u202620 months\u2014extending into the weeks before former president Donald Trump picked Vance as his running mate\u2014a glimpse of the Republican vice-presidential nominee\u2019s off-the-cuff musings, often matching his public expressions but voiced with much less polish and more profanity. Vance was just as casual in discussing America\u2019s foreign alliances as he was in evaluating his own private alliances with the GOP\u2019s moneyed class. With Johnson, he pondered responsibility for the sabotage of the Nord Stream gas pipelines and crudely described his aversion to the Ukrainian government and refusal to consider its pleas for U.S. assistance.\u201d\n\nForeign Policy\u2019s Amy Mackinnon explored what Harris learned investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election as a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Mackinnon reports that the investigation was \u201ca highly formative experience that left her [Harris] with few illusions about Moscow\u2019s intentions.\u201d\n\nWhat the Polls Show\n\nThe Pew Research Center released a report showing that how Americans view the U.S. role in the world varies substantially by age and less so by party identification. Older Americans are far more likely than younger Americans to say they want the United States to play an active role in world affairs. For instance, three-in-four Americans over the age of sixty-five favor an active U.S. role in the world; just one-in-three Americans between the ages of eighteen and thirty-four do. In contrast, 60 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents and 51 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents favor an active U.S. role in the world. Where Democrats and Republicans diverge is on the question of allies: 76 percent of Democrats believe the United States should consider allies\u2019 interests when making foreign-policy decisions while only 43 percent of Republicans do.\n\nThe Campaign Schedule\n\nThe Democratic National Convention opens in Chicago in ten days (August 19, 2024).\n\nThe second presidential debate is in thirty-two days (September 10, 2024)\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s sentencing hearing on his New York felony convictions is in forty days (September 18, 2024).\n\nThe first in-person absentee voting in the nation begins in Minnesota and South Dakota in forty-two days (September 20, 2024).\n\nElection Day is eighty-eight days away.\n\nInauguration Day is 164 days away.\n\nShelby Sires assisted in the preparation of this post.",

        "text": "Trump campaign struggles to lay a glove on surging Harris\nDonald Trump\u2019s campaign recognizes that it could lose in November if the election is decided on \u201cvibes\u201d and \u201cenergy\u201d, according to people close to the former president, as Kamala Harris continues to ride waves of momentum with her newly announced running mate Tim Walz.\n\nThe concern has also started to open fractures inside Trumpworld, with some Maga allies criticizing Trump\u2019s political advisers for running a campaign that may be too structurally deficient to stand up a ground game in swing states.\n\nThe Trump campaign has sketched out a strategy to hit back and is expected to try to cast the Harris campaign the most progressive US ticket of all time, as they aim to get the political messaging back on their records in office and away from coverage about the extraordinary enthusiasm Harris has generated with voters.\n\nThe Trump campaign intends to continue trying to make Harris responsible in the eyes of voters for the influx of migrants, and her role as the \u201cborder czar\u201d allowing migrants to spread across the country in part to alleviate pressure on border states.\n\nThat ties into their other strategy of pulling a \u201cWillie Horton\u201d attack from the old Republican playbook, suggesting on social media and in television ads that Harris was directly responsible for any crimes some migrants committed. Horton \u2013 a convicted murderer who committed more crimes while on prison furlough \u2013 was used in a racist attack strategy by George Bush during his 1988 presidential campaign.\n\nWith Walz, the strategy for now has been to say he ushered in progressive policies as Minnesota governor, focusing on how he supported transgender medical care for children, approved sweeping climate change legislation and enshrined abortion rights into law.\n\nThe campaign has also been eager to cast Walz as falsifying his military record \u2013 he has alluded vaguely to serving in Iraq although he left the military before his unit was deployed \u2013 an attack style that Trump\u2019s current co-campaign chief Chris LaCivita once used against the decorated Vietnam veteran John Kerry in the \u201cSwift Boat\u201d episode.\n\nThe effort to focus on Harris and Walz\u2019s governing records provide a window on to the Trump campaign knowing it needs to avoid a vibes-based election at all costs, the people said. The Trump campaign knows running on national mood will not work against Harris\u2019s stunning momentum since she entered the race in the way it did with Biden.\n\nFor weeks before Biden ultimately withdrew, the principal fear inside Trump world was that Biden dropping out would give a successor massive momentum. And it was for that reason that Trump himself refrained from piling on Biden, even as top Democrats pressured him to quit the race.\n\nThe momentum premonition has turned out to be true and highly problematic for the Trump campaign as they struggle to get into the news cycle. It is the first time that Trump has largely lost control of the media narrative \u2013 and with it, his ability to trash the Harris ticket \u2013 since he was indicted in 2023.\n\nBut it remains unclear whether the Trump attack lines will work, at least over the next few weeks with seemingly no end in sight for Harris\u2019s extended honeymoon period \u2013 an important factor because the longer the honeymoon period lasts, the less time Trump has to negatively define Harris.\n\nThe Trump campaign could find August to be a washout, one of the people observed. Walz could still dominate media coverage next week, and then Harris is expected to receive an outpouring of support at the Democratic national convention in Chicago the week after.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Trump spent some time testing out the \u201cCacklin\u2019 Kamala\u201d nickname to show her as unserious on account of her laugh, but he recently started trying \u201cKamabla\u201d \u2013 a sign he was not sold on his initial option though it is not clear what the insult means.",

        "text": "US election looms over US-South Korea-Japan security cooperation\nExperts in Washington are split on their perspectives of the durability of the recently elevated U.S.-South Korea-Japan security cooperation in the event of former President Donald Trump winning the November U.S. presidential election, given his critical stance toward U.S. alliances in the past.\n\nLast month, the U.S., South Korea and Japan signed a memorandum of cooperation on the Trilateral Security Cooperation Framework (TSCF), which is aimed at institutionalizing the countries' security partnership against threats from China and North Korea.\n\nWhile not legally binding, the memorandum is expected to facilitate trilateral security cooperation regardless of any leadership changes in their respective countries.\n\nThe agreement calls for regular high-level talks, joint exercises and other exchanges among the three nations.\n\nSome in Washington, however, question whether the United States, South Korea and Japan would successfully institutionalize the enhanced security cooperation in a second Trump presidency.\n\n\"Certainly, the greatest and near-term concern is if President Trump is reelected, whether he would undo some of the progress of recent years,\" Bruce Klingner, senior research fellow for Northeast Asia at the Heritage Foundation, told VOA Korean by telephone Wednesday.\n\nKlingner added that the three governments hoped that signing the memorandum would regularize and operationalize the ongoing security improvements among the three nations.\n\nThe Biden administration says stronger trilateral cooperation is an integral part of its Indo-Pacific strategy.\n\nThe administration also has been touting the August 2023 summit at Camp David with the U.S., South Korea and Japan as a historic meeting, saying the three leaders \"inaugurated a new era of trilateral partnership\" there.\n\nIn a Washington Post opinion piece published this week, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said that the U.S. security partnership in the Indo-Pacific region is working more effectively than before, citing the cooperation among the United States, South Korea and Japan as an example.\n\n\"President [Joe] Biden brought together Japan and South Korea \u2014 two countries with a difficult history \u2014 to join the United States in the Camp David Trilateral Summit, spurring unprecedented defense and economic cooperation among our countries,\" they wrote.\n\nUncertainty looms\n\nIt is uncertain how the U.S. trilateral partnership with South Korea and Japan would shape up if Trump returns to power, as the former president has not publicly articulated a stance on the trilateral cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nTrump has put strong emphasis on U.S. allies paying their \"fair share\" of defense costs.\n\nDuring his presidency, Trump demanded that South Korea and Japan pay more for the cost of the U.S. military presence in their countries. He warned the U.S. could withdraw its troops unless the demands were met.\n\nMichael O'Hanlon, director of foreign policy research at the Brookings Institution in Washington, told VOA Korean via email Wednesday that it would be hard to predict whether the TSCF would survive a possible Trump second term.\n\n\"Most things are personalized with him, or they relate to his instincts and impressions based on previous business dealings,\" he said.\n\n\"Both the leaders [of South Korea and Japan] he dealt with when president are now gone. So, it's a wild card or blank slate.\"\n\nHowever, some disagree.\n\nRichard Armitage, who served as deputy secretary of state during the George W. Bush administration, told VOA Korean by telephone Thursday that Trump would likely allow the institutionalization of the TSCF, considering the strong support from both sides of the aisle.\n\n\"I find the majority [of] members on Capitol Hill are very positive to it,\" Armitage said.\n\n\"I do notice that some of the people who are rumored to be coming in, should Mr. Trump win, are actually quite international in their outlook,\" he added, declining to say who those people are.\n\nAlliance commitment\n\nFrederick Fleitz, who served as chief of staff of the National Security Council in the Trump White House, told VOA Korean by phone Wednesday that he would expect the agreement on the security framework among the U.S. and the two U.S. allies in Asia to be upheld in a second Trump administration.\n\n\"It's going to remain,\" Fleitz said. \"He [Trump] is a strong supporter of alliances, particularly our alliance in the Asian Pacific.\"\n\nFleitz added that the stronger security ties among the three countries is \"a significant achievement that's going to continue.\"\n\nEvans Revere, who served as acting assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific affairs, told VOA Korean via email that China's rise to become the greatest threat in the Indo-Pacific theater is a fact not to be ignored by any of the three countries.\n\n\"There is every reason to believe the three countries can effectively institutionalize trilateral security cooperation, even if there is a change of administration in one or more of the three capitals,\" Revere said. \"There is a growing perception in all three countries of the threats and challenges they share in common. China's attempts at political, military and economic intimidation are becoming more frequent.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris, who is running to become the successor to Biden, is widely predicted to continue on the path Biden forged.\n\n\"Harris does not have a clearly established record on U.S.-South Korea-Japan security cooperation, but I expect that she will follow the policies of the Biden administration on this issue,\" Gary Samore, former White House coordinator for arms control and weapons of mass destruction during the Obama administration, told VOA Korean via email.\n\nBlinken, Austin and Sullivan highlighted in the Post opinion piece that the transformed approach toward the Indo-Pacific region is \"one of the most important and least-told stories of the foreign policy strategy advanced by President Biden and Vice President Harris.\"\n\nJoeun Lee contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Iran is targeting the U.S. election with fake news sites and cyber operations, research says\nIran is stepping up its influence campaign aimed at the U.S., researchers at Microsoft said in a new report, adding to the ongoing efforts by Russia and China to sway American public opinion before the presidential election.\n\nResearchers identified websites that they attributed to the Iranian operation, aimed at voters on the political left and right. One website, Nio Thinker, bills itself as \u201cyour go-to destination for insightful, progressive news and analysis that challenges the status quo\u201d and hosts articles that bash former President Donald Trump and hail Vice President Kamala Harris as \u201cour unexpected, awkward savior.\u201d\n\nAnother site identified by researchers, Savannah Time, poses as a voicey conservative local alt-weekly. \u201cWe\u2019re opinionated, we\u2019re noisy, and we\u2019re having a good time,\u201d the about section of the site says. It hosts articles claiming to be written by \u201cthe spokeswoman for the International League for Women\u2019s Rights,\u201d arguing for more modest Olympics beach volleyball bathing suits, next to articles lauding Iran\u2019s military might.\n\nThe Microsoft Threat Analysis Center noted the sites were likely using artificial intelligence tools to lift content from legitimate U.S. news publications and repackage articles in a way that hides the content\u2019s source.\n\nThe group behind the sites, according to Microsoft, is part of a larger Iranian operation, active since 2020, that operates more than a dozen other fake news sites targeting English-, French-, Spanish- and Arabic-speaking audiences. The campaign has not found significant success with a U.S. audience, and the sites\u2019 content has not been shared widely on social media, according to the researchers. But researchers say the sites could be used closer to the election.\n\nBeyond the effort to sow controversy and divide Americans before the vote, researchers said another group linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps targeted a \u201chigh-ranking official on a presidential campaign\u201d in June with a spear-phishing email from a compromised email account of a former senior adviser and attempted to access an account belonging to \u201ca former presidential candidate.\u201d The report did not name the people who had been targeted.\n\nIran\u2019s United Nations mission did not immediately respond to a request for comment but denied the reports of meddling in a statement to The Associated Press: \u201cIran has been the victim of numerous offensive cyber operations targeting its infrastructure, public service centers, and industries. Iran\u2019s cyber capabilities are defensive and proportionate to the threats it faces. Iran has neither the intention nor plans to launch cyber attacks. The U.S. presidential election is an internal matter in which Iran does not interfere.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s report also noted continued activity by Russia, including an operation by a group researchers call Storm-1516, which produces propaganda videos in support of Trump and Russian interests and distributes them through a network of fake news websites connected to a former U.S. police officer. China-linked actors, the report said, had also pivoted increasingly to spreading propaganda via video and had leveraged a network of online accounts to stoke outrage around pro-Palestinian university protests.\n\nThe researchers reported an expectation that Iran, along with China and Russia, would intensify cyberattacks against candidates and institutions and increase efforts to divide Americans with propaganda and disinformation in the run-up to the election.",

Was it because the Democrat presumptive candidate found him as radical as Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance ? According to 'The Telegraph', like Team Trump, the Harris campaign wanted to placate its radical wing. Donald Trump 's running mate is more religiously devout than him and more passionate about conservative issues like marriage and family. So, the Democrats too wanted to select someone who could be portrayed as religious and conservative.The news outlet has also reported that Walz was selected also because the Democratic strategists apprehended that Josh Shapiro's selection would have upset the progressive forces in the party. His views on the Israel-Hamas War would have angered the progressive elements of the party as well as the general public. Besides, he is a Lutheran, unlike Shapiro who is Jewish.The Democrat strategists also believe that Tim Walz is more moderate than Vance, and he can attract many voters who do not want the crazy ways of the US politics. According to The Telegraph, Walz has a 'folksy norminess', he has invented the \u201cweird\u201d attack line that Team Harris is now trotting out. Walz looks like an ordinary American, he talks a lot about being a football coach, he goes shooting with his Republican friends, he likes eating corn dogs and explains why cookies are the \u201cultimate bipartisan entry point.\u201dThe Harris campaign wanted to placate its radical wing as Donald Trump's running mate is more religiously devout than him.

        "text": "ABC News: Trump-Harris agree to presidential debate\nShowdown is set: Trump and Harris plan to debate in September\n\nMs Harris confirmed that she will attend the ABC debate while at an event in Michigan on Thursday, and said later that she would be open to additional debates.\n\n\u201cWe think we should do three debates,\u201d Trump said, suggesting two additional debates that he said would be hosted by Fox News and NBC, respectively.\n\nThe network confirmed the showdown in a post on X, formerly Twitter, after Trump said on Thursday that he would be open to debating his Democratic rival multiple times before the November election.\n\nABC News has said it will host the first debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris on 10 September.\n\nThe network said the debate will be moderated by World News Tonight anchor and managing editor David Muir and ABC News Live Prime anchor Linsey Davis.\n\n\u201cI am looking forward to debating Donald Trump and we have a date of September 10. I hear he\u2019s finally committed to it and I\u2019m looking forward to it,\" Ms Harris said at the event in Detroit.\n\nMr Trump, the Republican candidate, debated President Joe Biden once in June.\n\nThe two were slated to do so again on 10 September but Mr Biden withdrew from the presidential race after a disastrous performance against Trump in the televised matchup. That paved the way for Ms Harris to become the Democratic nominee.\n\nThe confirmation of the debate on ABC marks an end to a back-and-forth that followed Mr Biden's decision to leave the race between the Trump and Harris campaigns over that planned showdown.\n\nTrump had previously said that he wanted a debate hosted by the conservative network Fox News, saying it would take place in Pennsylvania, \"at a site in an area to be determined\".\n\nThe Harris campaign had maintained they would still like to debate Trump on 10 September.\n\nAt a news conference on Thursday at his Mar-a-Lago resort, Trump also said he would like to debate Ms Harris two additional times - on 4 September on Fox News and on 25 September on NBC.\n\nTrump said that CBS will host a debate between the two vice-presidential nominees, Republican JD Vance and Democratic Tim Walz.\n\nNBC News is reportedly in discussions with both campaigns about a potential debate this autumn, the New York Times reported.\n\nFox News said it sent formal letters to both campaigns last month proposing a September debate in Pennsylvania, though the Harris campaign said on Thursday that \"Trump has to show up\" to the ABC debate before they confirm any further showdowns.\n\nTrump also criticised Ms Harris for not taking reporter questions or doing an interview since she became the likely Democratic nominee just over two weeks ago.\n\nHe called her \u201cbarely competent\u201d and criticised her intelligence.\n\nLater on Thursday, Ms Harris told reporters that she has asked her team to \"get an interview scheduled\" before the end of the month.\n\nTrump's hour-long event was held amid reports that his campaign is feeling the pressure from Democrats, who have new enthusiasm under Ms Harris and have been dominating headlines.\n\nNational and battleground state polls suggest her campaign has gained ground in recent days, though the race for the White House remains a close contest.\n\nThe former president denied he had \"recalibrated\" his campaign to challenge Ms Harris instead of Mr Biden, and he appeared to prickle when asked about the audience Ms Harris draws at rallies.\n\n\"Oh, give me a break,\" he said, arguing that crowds at his rallies were larger than at hers.\n\nHis Thursday news conference is the first he has held in several months, as his campaign has previously focused on holding rallies across the country.\n\nTrump also praised his running mate Mr Vance, who was recently under fire for comments he made in 2021 when he said those without children shouldn't be leading the country and that women who don't have children are \"miserable\" and \"childless cat ladies\".\n\n\u201cI have to tell you, JD Vance has really stepped up,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe's doing a fantastic job.\u201d\n\nHe took aim at Ms Harris' track record on immigration and the economy.\n\nHe said that 20 million people had come over the US's southern border with Mexico, possibly many more, during the Biden-Harris administration.\n\nSince Mr Biden took office, the US Customs and Border Protection agency says almost 10.1 million crossings have been recorded.\n\nWhile this is a significant increase on Mr Trump's time in power and the highest figure recorded under any US administration, the 20 million figure does not seem probable.\n\nThe former president also said his tax cuts were \"the biggest in history\".\n\nBut according to analysis by the independent Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, they were the eighth-largest since 1918 measured as a percentage of the size of the economy (GDP), and the fourth-largest in dollar terms since 1940 adjusted for inflation.\n\nAlthough Trump didn't introduce the largest tax cut overall, he did pass the largest corporate tax cut in US history.\n\nHe repeated his belief that US presidents should have a say over interest rates and monetary policy - a departure from the longstanding practice of having the US Federal Reserve, an independent body, oversee these matters.\n\nHe emphasised his priorities of lowering inflation, lowering crime rates and strengthening the military.\n\nAnd he criticised the administration's transport policy, saying people would be \"forced\" to buy electric cars.\n\nHowever, the Biden administration has made it clear there are no plans for a ban on the sale of petrol vehicles.\n\nMs Harris on Thursday addressed United Auto Workers in Detroit, and thanked the union for endorsing her.\n\nShe said there are \"89 days to get this done\" ahead of the election.\n\nAdditional reporting by BBC Verify",

Microsoft said the goals are to stir controversy, gather political intelligence. sow doubt about election integrity and incite chaos. File photo by John Angelillo/UPI | License Photo\n\nAug. 9 (UPI) -- Microsoft warned in a Thursday report that Iran is seeking to influence the 2024 U.S. presidential election with cyber AI-enabled campaigns targeting both left-leaning and conservative voters. \"In recent weeks, groups connected with the Iranian government have upped two kinds of activity,\" Microsoft said in a statement. \"First, they've laid the groundwork for influence campaigns on trending election-related topics and begun to activate these campaigns in an apparent effort to stir up controversy or sway voters -- especially in swing states. Second, they've launched operations that Microsoft assesses are designed to gain intelligence on political campaigns and help enable them to influence the elections in the future.\" Advertisement\n\nThe Microsoft Threat Intelligence Report said Iran is working online to target both U.S. left-leaning political audiences and conservatives.\n\nOne Iranian group is using covert so-called news sites like Nio Thinker to attack Donald Trump as an \"opioid-pilled elephant in the MAGA China shop\" and Savannah Time that targets conservatives with LGBTQ+ issues and gender reassignment content, according to Microsoft.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe report added that Microsoft has found evidence that groups connected to Iran's government are using AI-enabled services to plagiarize content from U.S. publications.\n\nMicrosoft said these efforts seek to stoke discord, to carry out influence campaigns and stir controversy in battleground states while gathering intelligence on U.S. politics, and incite chaos and undermine authorities while sowing doubt about election integrity.\n\nAnother Iranian group, according to Microsoft, has been building the groundwork for influence operations targeting the United States since March \"that are even more extreme, including intimidation or inciting violence against political figures or groups.\"\n\nMicrosoft's report said a group connected with Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps sent out phishing emails in June to \"a high-ranking official on a presidential campaign from the compromised email account of a former senior advisor.\"\n\nThe email had a link that would direct traffic through a domain controlled by the group before routing to the website of the provided link.\n\n\"Within days of this activity, the same group unsuccessfully attempted to log into an account belonging to a former presidential candidate,\" Microsoft said. \"We've since notified those targeted.\"\n\nMicrosoft said it is sharing the intelligence on these activities so American voters, candidates, political parties, government institutions and others can be aware of the influence campaigns targeting U.S. elections and the political system.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrior to the 2020 election, Microsoft's threat assessment team issued similar warnings about \"an Iran-based cybercrime faction\" it believed was working to interfere in the presidential election.\n\nAt that time targeted accounts were associated with a U.S. presidential campaign, journalists covering global politics and prominent Iranians living outside Iran.\n\nIn April a Microsoft report said artificial intelligence threats from China and North Korea were aimed at influencing U.S., South Korean and Indiana elections.\n\nAmong the Chinese malign efforts to influence U.S. elections, according to Microsoft, were AI deep fake videos, audio and false \"news reports\" that had AI-generated phony news anchors.\n\nMicrosoft's assessment of those efforts was that they were used to amplify controversial issues while posting false stories, but the impact in altering voter opinions was low.\n\nAt the same time, Microsoft warned China's \"increasing experimentation in augmenting memes, videos, and audio will continue-and may prove effective down the line.\"",

        "text": "US Presidential election: Undecided voters to be game-changers in Trump-Harris showdown, say experts\nAs the 2024 US Presidential election draws closer, the sizzling contest between Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic contender Kamala Harris is gaining considerable attention. With under three months to go\u2014the election is on November 5\u2014recent polls and expert insights offer a glimpse into the evolving dynamics of this closely watched race.According to David Montgomery, Senior Data Journalist at YouGov, the election remains incredibly tight both nationally and in crucial swing states. Recent polling data from YouGov, collated in collaboration with CBS News, underscores that the key battlegrounds\u2014Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona, and Georgia\u2014are all too close to call.Montgomery highlights that while most Americans have already made their choice, a small yet pivotal group of undecided voters will likely determine the final outcome. This small fraction of undecided voters, many of whom are younger and possibly first-time voters, could swing the election in either direction, making their vote crucial.The legal troubles facing Donald Trump , including his status as the first former US president to be convicted, continue to be a significant point of discussion. Philip Bump, National Columnist at The Washington Post, notes that Trump\u2019s criminal record is already factored into Americans\u2019 views of him. Despite the potential for a September sentencing, Bump believes voters are unlikely to be swayed significantly. Instead, Trump\u2019s criminal charges have, to some extent, solidified his position among Republican voters and might not have a major impact on his approval ratings or the election\u2019s outcome.John Mark Hansen, Professor of Political Science at the University of Chicago, points out that Harris's debate skills and her appeal to younger voters have been instrumental in shaping the current race dynamic. The upcoming debate on September 10 will be a critical platform for Harris to leverage her perceived advantage as a debater.The real theatres of battle in this election will be the swing states, where polls show Harris currently has a slight edge. Harris is leading Trump by 2.1 points in the national average, and in a recent poll by YouGov, 42% of respondents considered her the better debater compared to 37% who favoured Trump.Both campaigns are targeting younger voters with distinct strategies. Trump\u2019s choice of JD Vance, emphasising his working-class background and academic achievements, contrasts with Harris's selection of Tim Walz, who brings a military and educational background to the table.Hansen notes that younger voters have traditionally leaned Democratic, but suggests that recent shifts might be influenced by Harris\u2019s appeal and her efforts to address concerns about Biden\u2019s age and capability.I think it's going to be a very close race in the fall. There are a bunch of headwinds for the Democrats. If you look at the so-called fundamentals, things like the economy and Biden's approval, they're really not very good right now. What's really helping, though, is that Democrats have become energised and hopeful again. And so the kind of support that they could expect on the basis of partisanship and on the basis of the qualms that many voters have about Donald Trump, that has now come to work in their favour.I don't think it necessarily affects how Americans view him. It's baked in, as we say. It's already something that Americans have considered and incorporated into their views of Donald Trump. I think that it was very helpful to him in securing the Republican nomination when he first became indicted in New York early last year. It really helped cement his leadership in the Republican field. I don't think necessarily that it's going to do additional harm, should that sentencing happen. Of course, the sentencing itself was already delayed. It's not clear if it actually will happen prior to the elections, so we'll have to wait and see. But this is something that people already incorporate into their views of Donald Trump. If you are going to the polls in November, I think the odds that you are going to be influenced by his having been sentenced or not sentenced are fairly low. Of course, it depends on what the sentence might be, but this dynamic of Donald Trump as having been convicted of criminal charges, running against Kamala Harris\u2014a former prosecutor\u2014I think that's already fairly well understood and I would be surprised if it actually led to any significant change in the polls.I think the short answer is that things are very close, both nationally and in the key swing states that will actually determine the election, with the Electoral College being the thing that determines the actual winner of the election.YouGov conducts mostly national polls, but our partner CBS News has done some modelling and they project that the sort of seven closest states both in the Midwestern United States, like Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, and in more Southern states like Arizona and Georgia, all of these are very close\u2014within the margin of error. This is a very close election but most Americans have already made up their minds and are firmly decided. There's only a relatively small percentage of Americans who are still genuinely up for grabs, and they'll be the ones who will determine the election by who they support or if they decide to stay home.It's awfully hard to say. In general, younger voters have been trending in the Democratic direction for a couple of generations now. There is some evidence that perhaps things had swung back a little bit toward the Republicans. Kamala Harris seems to have energised younger voters to a significant degree, too. They were the ones who were, I think, most concerned about the Biden candidacy. And by sort of taking Biden's age and ability off of the table as an issue, that, I think, has helped on the Democratic side.",

                "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is taking action against 19 individuals, 14 entities, and one aircraft pursuant to Belarus-related Executive Order (E.O.) 14038. This action targets persons involved in supporting Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine through military resource production and transshipment of goods to Russia, sanctions evasion on behalf of Belarusian defense entities, and revenue generation for Belarusian oligarchs in Alyaksandr Lukashenka\u2019s inner circle. OFAC is concurrently designating five of these targets\u2014three individuals and two entities\u2014pursuant to Russia-related E.O. 14024.\u00a0Lukashenka\u2019s support for Russia\u2019s indefensible war against Ukraine comes at a high cost for Belarus. Lukashenka has traded his country\u2019s autonomy and standing in the international community for his and his cronies\u2019 own financial and political benefits. Today\u2019s action reinforces the United States\u2019 commitment to holding the Lukashenka regime accountable for its attacks on the Belarusian democratic movement and its flagrant exploitation of the Belarusian people.\u00a0\u201cAs Belarus marks another year under Lukashenka\u2019s rule, the regime\u2019s blatantly corrupt, destabilizing, and anti-democratic acts\u2014along with its continued support for Russia\u2019s illegal invasion of Ukraine\u2014have only further ostracized Belarus from the global community,\u201d said Acting Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley T. Smith. \u201cThe United States, in coordination with our allies and partners, remains committed to holding the regime and its key facilitators accountable.\u201dIn the wake of the fraudulent August 2020 Belarusian Presidential election, Lukashenka resorted to brutal crackdowns on peaceful protesters, democratic organizations, and journalists in order to illegitimately retain power. Since then, Lukashenka\u2019s actions have eroded Belarusian civil society and enabled Lukashenka, his family, and his inner circle to enrich themselves at the expense of Belarus\u2019s citizens and sovereignty. The Lukashenka regime continues to support Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine by hosting Russian military bases and allowing Russian forces to use Belarus as a staging point for military operations. \u00a0Today\u2019s designations are amplified by actions undertaken by the United States\u2019 partners in the European Union (EU)\u2014who targeted Belarusian authorities involved in human rights abuses earlier this week\u2014and Canada and the United Kingdom, who today also announced additional sanctions on the Lukashenka regime. Together, these actions signal the international community\u2019s continuing solidarity with the Belarusian people in their struggle for a free, democratic, and sovereign Belarus.\u00a0The Department of State also took steps to impose visa restrictions on 19 regime officials and their affiliates for their involvement in undermining democracy in Belarus, pursuant to Presidential Proclamation 8015.PELENG SANCTIONS EVASION NETWORKAs part of the strong ties between Russia and Belarus with respect to their technology and defense-industrial industries, Belarus provides Russia with components for satellite communication systems and optical equipment. U.S.-designated Peleng JSC (Peleng) is the leading design enterprise in Belarus\u2019s optoelectronic industry, producing components for spacecraft, satellites, and sights with thermal imagers for military vehicles. Peleng is one of Russia\u2019s most important industrial partners in Belarus and has partnered with Russia on ventures ranging from artillery unit complex development to airfield automated meteorological systems supply. OFAC designated Peleng on\u00a0December 2, 2021\u00a0pursuant to E.O. 14038 for\u00a0operating or having operated in the defense and related materiel sector of the economy of Belarus and for operating or having operated in the security sector of the economy of Belarus.\u00a0LLC Laboratory of Additive Technologies (LAT), also recently known as LLC Laser Devices and Technologies, is identified as a Belarus-based entity focused on research and development in the natural sciences; however, LAT generates its revenue by supplying components to companies, including Peleng, that produce weapons for the Russian Federation and are under U.S. and EU sanctions. For example, LAT has procured encoder disks\u2014a component for sensors that detect motion and are used in panoramic sights for T-72s or other tanks\u2014from a Taiwanese precision instrument maker and bypassed sanctions to move the encoder disks and payment through a third-country intermediary. Yuri Aleksandrovich Chivel (Chivel), a Belarusian national, is LAT's Director and has signed contracts certifying that LAT intends to and has supplied components to Peleng. \u00a0OFAC is designating LAT pursuant to E.O. 14038 for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of Peleng, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14038. OFAC is designating Chivel pursuant to E.O. 14038 for having been a leader, official, senior executive officer, or member of the board of directors of LAT, an entity whose property and interests are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14038.OOO Ruchservomotor (Ruchservomotor) is a Belarusian developer and manufacturer of precision coordinate systems, including high precision milling and engraving products and services. Ruchservomotor's Director, Aliaksandr Uladzimiravich Zharski\u00a0(Zharski), a Belarusian national, and its Deputy Director, Siarhei Mikalaevich Sidaruk\u00a0(Sidaruk), also a Belarusian national, signed contracts agreeing to supply LAT with components. Ruchservomotor also produces components for panoramic commander\u2019s sights for T-72 and T-90 Russian tanks, for which Peleng is the end user. By using LAT as an intermediary to ship Russian military equipment components, Ruchservomotor has attempted to obfuscate its direct sales and connection to the Russian military.\u00a0OFAC is designating Ruchservomotor pursuant to E.O. 14038 for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of LAT, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14038. OFAC is designating Zharski and Sidaruk pursuant to E.O. 14038 for having been leaders, officials, senior executive officers, or members of the board of directors of Ruchservomotor, an entity whose property and interests are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14038. \u00a0Belarusian manufacturers LLC AlYurTekh (AlYurTekh) and its Deputy Director, Aleksey Nikolaevich Yavorski (Yavorski), a Belarusian national; ALC Diskoms (Diskoms) and its Deputy Director, Arkady Samuilovich Dimenshtein\u00a0(Dimenshtein), a Belarusian national; LLC MOT (MOT) and its Commercial Director, Viktoriya Orestovna Savruk (Savruk), a Ukrainian national; LLC Grosver Grup (Grosver Grup) and its representative, Siarhei Uladzimiravich Kastsianok (Kastsianok), a Belarusian national; and Limited Liability Company Tochnaya Mekhanika\u00a0(Tochnaya Mekhanika) and its Director, Aleksandr Mikolaevich Leschanka\u00a0(Leschanka), a Belarusian national, have all signed contracts committing the respective companies to supply Peleng with goods or services.\u00a0OFAC is designating AlYurTekh, Diskoms, MOT, Grosver Grup, and Tochnaya Mekhanika pursuant to E.O. 14038 for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of Peleng, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14038.OFAC is designating Yavorski pursuant to E.O. 14038 for having been a leader, official, senior executive officer, or member of the board of directors of AlYurTekh, an entity whose property and interests are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14038. OFAC is designating Dimenshtein pursuant to E.O. 14038 for having been a leader, official, senior executive officer, or member of the board of directors of Diskoms, an entity whose property and interests are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14038. OFAC is designating Savruk pursuant to E.O. 14038 for having been a leader, official, senior executive officer, or member of the board of directors of MOT, an entity whose property and interests are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14038. OFAC is designating Kastsianok pursuant to E.O. 14038 for having acted or is purported to have acted for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Grosver Grup, an entity whose property and interests are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14038. OFAC is designating Leschanka pursuant to E.O. 14038 for having been a leader, official, senior executive officer, or member of the board of directors of Tochnaya Mekhanika, an entity whose property and interests are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14038.CARGO AIRLINE COMPANIESAviakompaniya Rada LLC\u00a0(Rada) and UE RubiStar\u00a0(RubiStar) are two private Belarusian cargo airline companies that have long operated in the international transportation of a variety of products, including general cargo, engineering equipment, live animals, and dangerous goods.\u00a0In addition to their activities in the Belarusian transportation sector, both Rada and RubiStar have provided support to Russian defense activities. More specifically, Rada provided support to internationally designated Russian Private Military Company Wagner (Wagner Group) (designated on\u00a0June 20, 2017, November 15, 2022, and\u00a0January 26, 2023) by moving Wagner Group personnel and supplies to and from Africa. Additionally, on multiple occasions in 2024, RubiStar provided mission support to Russia by transporting Russian military personnel to Africa; and relatedly, at the request of a Russian company, RubiStar conducted the shipment of military helicopters to Africa. Finally, Rada has also participated in the trafficking of exotic animals between Mexico and Venezuela.Rada is led by its Commercial Director Dmitry Olegovich Ishchenko\u00a0(Ishchenko), a Russian national, and its Belarusian Director Ivan Nikolaevich Nareiko, while RubiStar is represented by its Belarusian Director, Evgeniy Ivanovich Mikholap\u00a0(Mikholap).OFAC is designating Rada, RubiStar, Ishchenko, Nareiko, and Mikholap pursuant to E.O. 14038 for operating or having operated in the transportation sector of the Belarus economy.OFAC is also designating Rada, RubiStar, Ishchenko, Nareiko, and Mikholap pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the defense and related materiel sector of the Russian Federation economy. On June 12, 2024, Treasury broadened the definition of Russia\u2019s military-industrial base to include all persons blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024. This means that foreign financial institutions risk being sanctioned for conducting or facilitating significant transactions, or providing any service, involving any person blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024. Foreign financial institutions face sanctions risk for continuing to facilitate transactions involving Russia\u2019s military-industrial base. Financial institutions should review\u00a0OFAC\u2019s updated sanctions advisory\u00a0for practical guidance on how to identify sanctions risks and implement corresponding controls.Aviakompaniya Belkanto LLC\u00a0(Belkanto) is another Belarus-based private cargo airline company that was formed on paper in 2020, but began operating in 2022 under the leadership of former executives of Belarusian state-owned cargo airline company Transaviaexport. On\u00a0December 2, 2021, OFAC designated Transaviaexport for operating or having operated in the transportation sector of the economy of Belarus and for being owned or controlled by, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the Government of Belarus (GoB). Following Transaviaexport\u2019s designation, Belkanto took ownership of one of Transaviaexport\u2019s planes and began leasing other aircraft from the company. Belkanto\u2019s business is focused on many of the same areas of operation as Transaviaexport, including the transshipment of goods to Russia.OFAC is designating Belkanto pursuant to E.O. 14038 for operating or having operated in the transportation sector of the Belarus economy.LOGISTICS COMPANIES GENERATING REVENUE FOR LUKASHENKA \u2018WALLETS\u2019 AND RE-EXPORTING GOODS TO RUSSIARuzekspeditsiya LLC\u00a0(Ruzekspeditsiya) and VLATE Logistic LLC (VLATE) are two Belarus-based logistics entities involved in the management of border crossing logistics and transportation services through Belarus to Russia, including the re-export of machinery, hydrocarbons, and Western European goods to Russia. These companies form the core of a logistics network controlled by U.S.-designated Lukashenka \u2018wallets\u2019\u00a0\u2014 Belarusian oligarchs who receive preferential treatment from the GoB in exchange for providing funds to Lukashenka and other members of his inner circle; financing Lukashenka\u2019s personal projects; and publicly supporting the regime \u2014\u00a0Aliaksandr Zaitsau\u00a0(February 24, 2022), Mikalai Varabei, and\u00a0Aliaksey Aleksin\u00a0(both on August 9, 2021). Since the\u00a0August 9, 2021 U.S. designation of these oligarchs\u2019 logistics company,\u00a0Bremino Group, Ruzekspeditsiya and VLATE have taken over many of Bremino Group\u2019s former operations, increasing these two companies\u2019 revenue exponentially. As a result of Ruzekspeditsiya and VLATE\u2019s connections to Zaitsau, Varabei, and Aleksin, both companies receive privileged tax status and limited customs fees from Lukashenka.Ruzekspeditsiya and VLATE are owned and directed by six individuals\u2014Belarusian businessmen Oleg Romualdovich Gerasim\u00a0(Gerasim), Oleg Fedorovich Barabanov\u00a0(Barabanov), Dmitry Mikhailovich Zamulevich\u00a0(Zamulevich), and Evgeniy Yurievich Krokhotin\u00a0(Krokhotin), and Russian businessmen Vladimir Mikhailovich Arkadiev (Arkadiev) and Oleg Vladimirovich Petrov\u00a0(Petrov)\u2014who are all personally connected to Zaitsau, Varabei, and Aleksin, and represent these oligarchs\u2019 interest in the companies.OFAC is designating Ruzekspeditsiya, VLATE, Gerasim, Petrov, Barabanov, Zamulevich, Arkadiev, and Krokhotin pursuant to E.O. 14038 for operating or having operated in the transportation sector of the Belarus economy.DEFENSE SECTOR ENTITIES SUPPORTING RUSSIAN WAR EFFORTJoint Stock Company Plant Legmash\u00a0(Legmash) is a Belarus-based manufacturing plant that has shifted its operations to produce artillery ammunition to supply the Belarusian and Russian armed forces. In May 2024, Lukashenka visited Legmash and alongside Legmash\u2019s Belarusian Director, Vladislav Nikolaevich Pavlenko\u00a0(Pavlenko), inspected Legmash\u2019s new defense sector operations and commented on Legmash\u2019s importance to the Belarusian defense-industrial sector.OFAC is designating Legmash and Pavlenko pursuant to E.O. 14038 for operating or having operated in the defense and related materiel sector of the Belarus economy.KB Unmanned Helicopters\u00a0(UAVHeli) is a Belarusian unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) developer and manufacturer that specializes in the production of drones for use in the security and defense sectors. Since its inception, UAVHeli has been led by Belarusian businessman Vladimir Vladimirovich Chudakov (Chudakov), who has sold UAVHeli\u2019s products to the Belarusian and Russian defense sectors.OFAC is designating UAVHeli and Chudakov pursuant to E.O. 14038 for operating or having operated in the defense and related materiel sector of the Belarus economy.LUKASHENKA\u2019S LUXURY AIRLINERLukashenka maintains a fleet of Government of Belarus-owned planes that he uses professionally and for his personal leisure. EW-001PB is a Boeing 767-32K(ER) owned by the Government of Belarus and used as part of the fleet of presidential aircraft. OFAC is identifying EW-001PB as property in which Lukashenka, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14038, has an interest. OFAC has previously identified as blocked property several other aircraft in the presidential fleet, including EW-001PA (March 24, 2023) and EW-301PJ (August 9, 2023).\u00a0SANCTIONS IMPLICATIONSAs a result of today\u2019s action, all property and interests in property of the designated persons described above that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC. In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. Unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt, OFAC\u2019s regulations generally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or otherwise blocked persons.\u00a0In addition, financial institutions and other persons that engage in certain transactions or activities with the sanctioned entities and individuals may expose themselves to sanctions or be subject to an enforcement action. The prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any designated person, or the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.\u00a0The power and integrity of OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFAC\u2019s ability to designate and add persons to the SDN List, but also from its willingness to remove persons from the SDN List consistent with the law. The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior. For information concerning the process for seeking removal from an OFAC list, including the SDN List, please refer to OFAC\u2019s Frequently Asked Question 897 here.\u00a0For detailed information on the process to submit a request for removal from an OFAC sanctions list, please click here.Click here for more information on the individuals and entities sanctioned today.###",

Today\u2019s action reinforces the United States\u2019 commitment to holding the Lukashenka regime accountable for its attacks on the Belarusian democratic movement and its flagrant exploitation of the Belarusian people.\n\n\u201cAs Belarus marks another year under Lukashenka\u2019s rule, the regime\u2019s blatantly corrupt, destabilizing, and anti-democratic acts\u2014along with its continued support for Russia\u2019s illegal invasion of Ukraine\u2014have only further ostracized Belarus from the global community,\u201d said Acting Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley T. Smith. \u201cThe United States, in coordination with our allies and partners, remains committed to holding the regime and its key facilitators accountable.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of the fraudulent August 2020 Belarusian Presidential election, Lukashenka resorted to brutal crackdowns on peaceful protesters, democratic organizations, and journalists in order to illegitimately retain power. Since then, Lukashenka\u2019s actions have eroded Belarusian civil society and enabled Lukashenka, his family, and his inner circle to enrich themselves at the expense of Belarus\u2019s citizens and sovereignty. The Lukashenka regime continues to support Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine by hosting Russian military bases and allowing Russian forces to use Belarus as a staging point for military operations.\n\nToday\u2019s designations are amplified by actions undertaken by the United States\u2019 partners in the European Union (EU)\u2014who targeted Belarusian authorities involved in human rights abuses earlier this week\u2014and Canada and the United Kingdom, who today also announced additional sanctions on the Lukashenka regime. Together, these actions signal the international community\u2019s continuing solidarity with the Belarusian people in their struggle for a free, democratic, and sovereign Belarus.\n\nThe Department of State also took steps to impose visa restrictions on 19 regime officials and their affiliates for their involvement in undermining democracy in Belarus, pursuant to Presidential Proclamation 8015.\n\nPELENG SANCTIONS EVASION NETWORK\n\nAs part of the strong ties between Russia and Belarus with respect to their technology and defense-industrial industries, Belarus provides Russia with components for satellite communication systems and optical equipment. U.S.-designated Peleng JSC (Peleng) is the leading design enterprise in Belarus\u2019s optoelectronic industry, producing components for spacecraft, satellites, and sights with thermal imagers for military vehicles. Peleng is one of Russia\u2019s most important industrial partners in Belarus and has partnered with Russia on ventures ranging from artillery unit complex development to airfield automated meteorological systems supply. OFAC designated Peleng on December 2, 2021 pursuant to E.O. 14038 for operating or having operated in the defense and related materiel sector of the economy of Belarus and for operating or having operated in the security sector of the economy of Belarus.\n\nLLC Laboratory of Additive Technologies (LAT), also recently known as LLC Laser Devices and Technologies, is identified as a Belarus-based entity focused on research and development in the natural sciences; however, LAT generates its revenue by supplying components to companies, including Peleng, that produce weapons for the Russian Federation and are under U.S. and EU sanctions. For example, LAT has procured encoder disks\u2014a component for sensors that detect motion and are used in panoramic sights for T-72s or other tanks\u2014from a Taiwanese precision instrument maker and bypassed sanctions to move the encoder disks and payment through a third-country intermediary. Yuri Aleksandrovich Chivel (Chivel), a Belarusian national, is LAT's Director and has signed contracts certifying that LAT intends to and has supplied components to Peleng.\n\nOFAC is designating LAT pursuant to E.O. 14038 for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of Peleng, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14038. OFAC is designating Chivel pursuant to E.O. 14038 for having been a leader, official, senior executive officer, or member of the board of directors of LAT, an entity whose property and interests are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14038.\n\nOOO Ruchservomotor (Ruchservomotor) is a Belarusian developer and manufacturer of precision coordinate systems, including high precision milling and engraving products and services. Ruchservomotor's Director, Aliaksandr Uladzimiravich Zharski (Zharski), a Belarusian national, and its Deputy Director, Siarhei Mikalaevich Sidaruk (Sidaruk), also a Belarusian national, signed contracts agreeing to supply LAT with components. Ruchservomotor also produces components for panoramic commander\u2019s sights for T-72 and T-90 Russian tanks, for which Peleng is the end user. By using LAT as an intermediary to ship Russian military equipment components, Ruchservomotor has attempted to obfuscate its direct sales and connection to the Russian military.\n\nOFAC is designating Ruchservomotor pursuant to E.O. 14038 for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of LAT, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14038. OFAC is designating Zharski and Sidaruk pursuant to E.O. 14038 for having been leaders, officials, senior executive officers, or members of the board of directors of Ruchservomotor, an entity whose property and interests are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14038.\n\nBelarusian manufacturers LLC AlYurTekh (AlYurTekh) and its Deputy Director, Aleksey Nikolaevich Yavorski (Yavorski), a Belarusian national; ALC Diskoms (Diskoms) and its Deputy Director, Arkady Samuilovich Dimenshtein (Dimenshtein), a Belarusian national; LLC MOT (MOT) and its Commercial Director, Viktoriya Orestovna Savruk (Savruk), a Ukrainian national; LLC Grosver Grup (Grosver Grup) and its representative, Siarhei Uladzimiravich Kastsianok (Kastsianok), a Belarusian national; and Limited Liability Company Tochnaya Mekhanika (Tochnaya Mekhanika) and its Director, Aleksandr Mikolaevich Leschanka (Leschanka), a Belarusian national, have all signed contracts committing the respective companies to supply Peleng with goods or services.\n\nOFAC is designating AlYurTekh, Diskoms, MOT, Grosver Grup, and Tochnaya Mekhanika pursuant to E.O. 14038 for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of Peleng, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14038.\n\nOFAC is designating Yavorski pursuant to E.O. 14038 for having been a leader, official, senior executive officer, or member of the board of directors of AlYurTekh, an entity whose property and interests are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14038. OFAC is designating Dimenshtein pursuant to E.O. 14038 for having been a leader, official, senior executive officer, or member of the board of directors of Diskoms, an entity whose property and interests are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14038. OFAC is designating Savruk pursuant to E.O. 14038 for having been a leader, official, senior executive officer, or member of the board of directors of MOT, an entity whose property and interests are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14038. OFAC is designating Kastsianok pursuant to E.O. 14038 for having acted or is purported to have acted for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Grosver Grup, an entity whose property and interests are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14038. OFAC is designating Leschanka pursuant to E.O. 14038 for having been a leader, official, senior executive officer, or member of the board of directors of Tochnaya Mekhanika, an entity whose property and interests are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14038.\n\nCARGO AIRLINE COMPANIES\n\nAviakompaniya Rada LLC (Rada) and UE RubiStar (RubiStar) are two private Belarusian cargo airline companies that have long operated in the international transportation of a variety of products, including general cargo, engineering equipment, live animals, and dangerous goods.\n\nIn addition to their activities in the Belarusian transportation sector, both Rada and RubiStar have provided support to Russian defense activities. More specifically, Rada provided support to internationally designated Russian Private Military Company Wagner (Wagner Group) (designated on June 20, 2017, November 15, 2022, and January 26, 2023) by moving Wagner Group personnel and supplies to and from Africa. Additionally, on multiple occasions in 2024, RubiStar provided mission support to Russia by transporting Russian military personnel to Africa; and relatedly, at the request of a Russian company, RubiStar conducted the shipment of military helicopters to Africa. Finally, Rada has also participated in the trafficking of exotic animals between Mexico and Venezuela.\n\nRada is led by its Commercial Director Dmitry Olegovich Ishchenko (Ishchenko), a Russian national, and its Belarusian Director Ivan Nikolaevich Nareiko, while RubiStar is represented by its Belarusian Director, Evgeniy Ivanovich Mikholap (Mikholap).\n\nOFAC is designating Rada, RubiStar, Ishchenko, Nareiko, and Mikholap pursuant to E.O. 14038 for operating or having operated in the transportation sector of the Belarus economy.\n\nOFAC is also designating Rada, RubiStar, Ishchenko, Nareiko, and Mikholap pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the defense and related materiel sector of the Russian Federation economy. On June 12, 2024, Treasury broadened the definition of Russia\u2019s military-industrial base to include all persons blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024. This means that foreign financial institutions risk being sanctioned for conducting or facilitating significant transactions, or providing any service, involving any person blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024. Foreign financial institutions face sanctions risk for continuing to facilitate transactions involving Russia\u2019s military-industrial base. Financial institutions should review OFAC\u2019s updated sanctions advisory for practical guidance on how to identify sanctions risks and implement corresponding controls.\n\nAviakompaniya Belkanto LLC (Belkanto) is another Belarus-based private cargo airline company that was formed on paper in 2020, but began operating in 2022 under the leadership of former executives of Belarusian state-owned cargo airline company Transaviaexport. On December 2, 2021, OFAC designated Transaviaexport for operating or having operated in the transportation sector of the economy of Belarus and for being owned or controlled by, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the Government of Belarus (GoB). Following Transaviaexport\u2019s designation, Belkanto took ownership of one of Transaviaexport\u2019s planes and began leasing other aircraft from the company. Belkanto\u2019s business is focused on many of the same areas of operation as Transaviaexport, including the transshipment of goods to Russia.\n\nOFAC is designating Belkanto pursuant to E.O. 14038 for operating or having operated in the transportation sector of the Belarus economy.\n\nLOGISTICS COMPANIES GENERATING REVENUE FOR LUKASHENKA \u2018WALLETS\u2019 AND RE-EXPORTING GOODS TO RUSSIA\n\nRuzekspeditsiya LLC (Ruzekspeditsiya) and VLATE Logistic LLC (VLATE) are two Belarus-based logistics entities involved in the management of border crossing logistics and transportation services through Belarus to Russia, including the re-export of machinery, hydrocarbons, and Western European goods to Russia. These companies form the core of a logistics network controlled by U.S.-designated Lukashenka \u2018wallets\u2019 \u2014 Belarusian oligarchs who receive preferential treatment from the GoB in exchange for providing funds to Lukashenka and other members of his inner circle; financing Lukashenka\u2019s personal projects; and publicly supporting the regime \u2014 Aliaksandr Zaitsau (February 24, 2022), Mikalai Varabei, and Aliaksey Aleksin (both on August 9, 2021). Since the August 9, 2021 U.S. designation of these oligarchs\u2019 logistics company, Bremino Group, Ruzekspeditsiya and VLATE have taken over many of Bremino Group\u2019s former operations, increasing these two companies\u2019 revenue exponentially. As a result of Ruzekspeditsiya and VLATE\u2019s connections to Zaitsau, Varabei, and Aleksin, both companies receive privileged tax status and limited customs fees from Lukashenka.\n\nRuzekspeditsiya and VLATE are owned and directed by six individuals\u2014Belarusian businessmen Oleg Romualdovich Gerasim (Gerasim), Oleg Fedorovich Barabanov (Barabanov), Dmitry Mikhailovich Zamulevich (Zamulevich), and Evgeniy Yurievich Krokhotin (Krokhotin), and Russian businessmen Vladimir Mikhailovich Arkadiev (Arkadiev) and Oleg Vladimirovich Petrov (Petrov)\u2014who are all personally connected to Zaitsau, Varabei, and Aleksin, and represent these oligarchs\u2019 interest in the companies.\n\nOFAC is designating Ruzekspeditsiya, VLATE, Gerasim, Petrov, Barabanov, Zamulevich, Arkadiev, and Krokhotin pursuant to E.O. 14038 for operating or having operated in the transportation sector of the Belarus economy.\n\nDEFENSE SECTOR ENTITIES SUPPORTING RUSSIAN WAR EFFORT\n\nJoint Stock Company Plant Legmash (Legmash) is a Belarus-based manufacturing plant that has shifted its operations to produce artillery ammunition to supply the Belarusian and Russian armed forces. In May 2024, Lukashenka visited Legmash and alongside Legmash\u2019s Belarusian Director, Vladislav Nikolaevich Pavlenko (Pavlenko), inspected Legmash\u2019s new defense sector operations and commented on Legmash\u2019s importance to the Belarusian defense-industrial sector.\n\nOFAC is designating Legmash and Pavlenko pursuant to E.O. 14038 for operating or having operated in the defense and related materiel sector of the Belarus economy.\n\nKB Unmanned Helicopters (UAVHeli) is a Belarusian unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) developer and manufacturer that specializes in the production of drones for use in the security and defense sectors. Since its inception, UAVHeli has been led by Belarusian businessman Vladimir Vladimirovich Chudakov (Chudakov), who has sold UAVHeli\u2019s products to the Belarusian and Russian defense sectors.\n\nOFAC is designating UAVHeli and Chudakov pursuant to E.O. 14038 for operating or having operated in the defense and related materiel sector of the Belarus economy.\n\nLUKASHENKA\u2019S LUXURY AIRLINER\n\nLukashenka maintains a fleet of Government of Belarus-owned planes that he uses professionally and for his personal leisure. EW-001PB is a Boeing 767-32K(ER) owned by the Government of Belarus and used as part of the fleet of presidential aircraft. OFAC is identifying EW-001PB as property in which Lukashenka, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14038, has an interest. OFAC has previously identified as blocked property several other aircraft in the presidential fleet, including EW-001PA (March 24, 2023) and EW-301PJ (August 9, 2023).\n\nSANCTIONS IMPLICATIONS\n\nAs a result of today\u2019s action, all property and interests in property of the designated persons described above that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC. In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. Unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt, OFAC\u2019s regulations generally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or otherwise blocked persons.\n\nIn addition, financial institutions and other persons that engage in certain transactions or activities with the sanctioned entities and individuals may expose themselves to sanctions or be subject to an enforcement action. The prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any designated person, or the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.\n\nThe power and integrity of OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFAC\u2019s ability to designate and add persons to the SDN List, but also from its willingness to remove persons from the SDN List consistent with the law. The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior. For information concerning the process for seeking removal from an OFAC list, including the SDN List, please refer to OFAC\u2019s Frequently Asked Question 897 here. For detailed information on the process to submit a request for removal from an OFAC sanctions list, please click here.\n\nClick here for more information on the individuals and entities sanctioned today.\n\n###",

        "text": "US Presidential Election 2024: Trump says he has agreed to debate Harris three times in September\nWashington DC [US], August 9 (ANI): Former US President Donald Trump on Thursday said he is open to debating Vice President Kamala Harris three times in September, ahead of the presidential election.\n\nSpeaking at his Mar-a-Lago resort, Trump confirmed he has accepted debate invitations from NBC News, Fox News, and ABC News.\n\n\"I think it's very important to have debates,\" Trump said while addressing a press conference, adding that he accepted invitations from NBC News, Fox News and ABC News.\n\nHarris has accused Trump of \"running scared\" and trying to avoid the debate.\n\nTrump had initially agreed to debate President Joe Biden and accepted ABC's invitation in May.\n\n\n\nHowever, after Biden withdrew from the race last month and Harris became the presumptive Democratic nominee, Trump implied he might not debate Harris on ABC.\n\nWhen President Joe Biden was still running, his campaign and Trump's agreed to two debates: one with CNN on June 27 and another with ABC News on September 10.\n\nBut after Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris, Trump began to waver on his commitment to participating.\n\nEarlier, US President Joe Biden on Wednesday said he is not confident about a peaceful transfer of power if Republican Donald Trump loses the upcoming presidential election.\n\nIn a recent interview with US-based media house CBS News, the first after announcing his withdrawal from the Presidential race, Biden expressed doubts about a peaceful transfer of power and said, \"If Trump loses, I'm not confident at all.\"\n\nBiden said that he is not confident about a peaceful transfer of power if Trump loses, as a rhetoric on the former President's comment that the only way he would lose is if \"the election is stolen from him.\"\n\n\"If Trump loses, I'm not confident at all. He means what he says. We don't take him seriously. He means it, all the stuff about, 'If we lose, there'll be a bloodbath, it'll have to be a stolen election,'\" Biden said when asked if he was confident about the transfer of power in January 2025.

These bribes were allegedly paid to obtain and retain business related to providing voting machines and election services for the 2016 Philippine elections and to secure payments on the contracts, including the release of value added tax payments.\n\nThe co-conspirators allegedly funded the bribes through a slush fund that was created by over-invoicing the cost per voting machine for the 2016 Philippine elections. To conceal and disguise the nature and purpose of the corrupt payments, the co-conspirators used coded language to refer to the slush fund and caused the creation of fraudulent contracts and sham loan agreements to justify transfers. The co-conspirators then allegedly laundered funds related to the bribery scheme through bank accounts located in Asia, Europe, and the United States, including in the Southern District of Florida.\n\nPinate and Vasquez are each charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and one substantive violation of the FCPA. Bautista, Pinate, Vasquez, and Elie Moreno, 44, a dual citizen of Venezuela and Israel, are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering and three counts of international laundering of monetary instruments. If convicted, Pinate and Vasquez each face a maximum penalty of five years in prison for the FCPA and conspiracy to violate the FCPA counts. Bautista, Pinate, Vasquez, and Moreno each face a maximum penalty of 20 years for each count of international laundering of monetary instruments and conspiracy to commit money laundering.\n\nPrincipal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division; U.S. Attorney Markenzy Lapointe for the Southern District of Florida; Special Agent in Charge Anthony Salisbury of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Miami; and Special Agent in Charge Matthew D. Line of IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS CI) Miami made the announcement.\n\nHSI\u2019s El Dorado Task Force Miami is investigating the case, with assistance from IRS CI Miami.\n\nTrial Attorneys Michael DiLorenzo and Connor Mullin and Assistant Chief Alexander Kramer of the Criminal Division\u2019s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Emery for the Southern District of Florida are prosecuting the case. The Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs and the Philippine Department of Justice and Office of the Ombudsman provided substantial assistance.\n\nThe Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting FCPA and Foreign Extortion Prevention Act (FEPA) matters. Additional information about the Justice Department\u2019s FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.\n\nAn indictment is merely an allegation. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.",

        "text": "Comparing the 2024 Presidential Candidates\u2019 Energy Agendas\nThe 2024 GOP Platform supports deregulation and incentives for traditional energy sources like coal, oil, natural gas, and some renewables. During the former President\u2019s term, he rolled back more than 100 environmental rules and former Trump colleagues have outlined a plan to continue to do the same. The Republican Vice Presidential candidate, JD Vance, has shown limited support for or opposition to most climate policies but has supported regulation as a response to environmental health, such as toxic spills.\n\nThe Biden-Harris administration supports investment in clean energy through the Inflation Reduction Act and various initiatives, including Justice40, which supports environmental justice efforts. Vice President Harris is expected to continue these actions with a potentially more progressive climate stance if elected. She previously supported a fracking ban, but has since reversed her opinion. Harris may emphasize environmental justice in her campaign but has yet to provide a formal plan. The Democratic Vice Presidential candidate, Tim Walz, has mostly aligned with Biden-Harris policies, at times going further to cut emissions, while also working with oil companies to rebuild the Line 3 pipeline project.\n\nMeanwhile, as of 2023, most Americans want the U.S. president to do more to address global warming.\n\nThe President can enact or dismantle energy policy in various ways. Here is a comparison of the candidates\u2019 energy policies and the mechanisms they might use. (Harris\u2019s specific 2025 energy policy goals are not included.)\n\nNote: please click on this image to see the detailed text.\n\nEasy to Execute\n\nExecutive Order and Agency Regulation\n\nTargeted Policies:\n\nEmissions targets\n\nInternational agreements and participation\n\nAgency initiatives and organization\n\nRegulating emissions can be targeted through executive orders, like Order 14057, or actions. Trump plans to exit the Paris Climate Accords and remove U.S. emissions targets, which are currently set to be reduced by 52% by 2030. During former President Trump\u2019s term, his administration rolled back more than 100 environmental rules , and Project 2025, a document created by the Heritage Foundation, outlines a plan to continue this effort.\n\nProject 2025 aims to remove renewable research or other science research groups within the Department of Energy. While the president has reorganization authority, there could be challenges with leaving allocated funding unused if the IRA already specified this money.\n\nWhile Americans have mixed views on natural gas, oil, and drilling, most support taxing polluters. Both candidates support \u201cenergy independence\u201d and reducing reliance on other countries. Both the Biden and Trump administrations have overseen a time in which the U.S. has led global oil production.\n\nA Trump presidency could reduce regulation and hurdles for oil and gas companies. Trump has called for tax cuts for U.S. oil and gas companies. Executive orders and rewriting the tax code could accomplish these goals, but they may require congressional support.\n\nA Harris presidency could continue to face legal battles on permitting action, such as limiting leasing on federal lands, withdrawing the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, and pausing approvals of new liquified natural gas exports. Harris has historically been slightly stricter on oil regulation than President Biden.\n\nBoth parties support expedited permitting, with Trump preferring traditional fuels, often done through an executive order instructing how agencies act on legislation.\n\nModerately Difficult to Achieve\n\nTax Regulation and Unallocated Congressional Funding\n\nTargeted Policies:\n\nRenewable energy project funding\n\nEfficiency standards for homes and vehicles\n\nMany proposed policies can be achieved through re-writing the tax code, pausing non-obligated funds, or changing how federal agencies allocate loans. Due to the recent ruling overturning Chevron deference, Trump would have more capacity to do so in this term, while Harris may see challenges disseminating funds where policy is ambiguous.\n\nThe IRA and Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors and Science (CHIPS ) Act are unlikely to be canceled without congressional action. A second Trump term would face challenges to repeal promised tax breaks completely, such as tax credit eligibility for electric vehicles, efficient vehicles, or appliances.\n\nGenerally, renewable projects like solar farms may face delays due to increased tariffs and shifting manufacturing priorities. Trump has previously expressed that he would implement an executive order targeting offshore wind. Still, it would be difficult to do more than pause loans and rewrite tax laws to slow the trajectory of renewable production.\n\nWith bills such as the IRA, CHIPS Act, and related executive orders already in place, continuing these efforts under a Harris presidency would likely not be as difficult as removing them.\n\nDifficult to Accomplish\n\nWithhold Congressional Spending\n\nFormer President Trump has pledged to cut wasteful spending within the federal budget, which is interpreted to include dismantling specific agency sections and rules. Congress sets the federal budget, and the president does not have the authority to withhold appropriated spending. Such action would require significant effort from the other government branches.\n\nWhile dismantling energy policy may be more difficult than during Trump\u2019s 2016 term, emissions projections reflect a need to continue and potentially double renewable energy and decarbonization to meet 2050 targets.",

        "text": "Election\u2019s Impact on Commercial Real Estate\nInterest rates and optics in an election year\n\nInterest rates and inflation may be top of mind for multifamily investors as election day approaches, but the Federal Reserve bases its decisions solely on economic factors, not political ones.\n\nThe independence of the Fed to manage monetary policy without regard to political considerations is fundamental. The Fed has consistently and repeatedly said its decision to adjust policy rates will be based on evidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward its long-term 2% average target to help maintain this independence and avoid any charges of partisanship.\n\nThe last meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) before the election is September 18. The proximity to the election and recently published quarterly economic projections will add attention to the meeting. But even after September 18, rates could be volatile as the presumed outcome of the election could influence the future of inflation.\n\nPotential housing regulation stability\n\nWhile increased funding for multifamily housing is possible, it\u2019s largely dependent on Congress. Regardless of the next president, however, it\u2019s unlikely housing funding and policies will be rolled back.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve increasingly seen a frustration with the cost of housing across party lines,\u201d said Nick Luettke, Associate Economist at Moody\u2019s CRE.\n\nWhile both parties want more affordable housing, they\u2019re likely to take different approaches. If either party gains control over the House of Representatives, Senate and White House, housing policies could see significant changes.\n\nIt\u2019s a different story with a divided government. \u201cIn that case, federal housing policies will likely remain the same, with the level of political polarization in Congress impacting commercial real estate policymaking more than the presidential election,\u201d Luettke said.\n\nThe election and economy\u2019s impact on infrastructure spending\n\n\u201cWith either outcome, there will likely be continued federal investment via the Infrastructure and Jobs Act into roads, bridges, power and grid, passenger and freight rail, water infrastructure, housing, broadband, airports and more,\u201d Chambless said.\n\nIt\u2019s important to consider the role of Congress here. \u201cInfrastructure spending will likely remain fairly stable should a split Congress and president be elected, with greater expansion or cuts being easier should either party successfully sweep,\u201d Luettke said.\n\nAside from Congressional election outcomes, infrastructure spending often picks up during economic downturns in response to rising unemployment. So there\u2019s also a possibility either administration could pour funding into infrastructure, depending on the economic landscape.\n\nSuch continued investment could benefit commercial real estate. Take modular housing, for example. \u201cModular construction\u2019s factory-like approach really drives costs down,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cThe negative is it\u2019s extremely expensive to move modular housing.\u201d\n\n\u201cInfrastructure spending is likely to depend more on macroeconomic health and whether deficit reduction or a stimulus is more necessary for a struggling labor market,\u201d Luettke said.\n\nReal estate and strategic supply chain spending\n\nLuettke noted that infrastructure legislation related to national security and supporting supply chains is the most vulnerable to geopolitical developments. It\u2019s also the most likely to be favored across administrations and congressional outcomes.\n\nBoth potential administrations appear to be acting tough with China on trade. Homeshoring and nearshoring are likely to continue regardless of election results. Both efforts can help commercial real estate and multifamily reduce development timelines and costs.\n\n\u201cIn the last eight years, conventional wisdom toward free-trade agreements has nearly disappeared,\u201d Luettke said. \u201cInstead, supply chain choices have increasingly been viewed as part of broader strategic relationships combining domestic protectionism of key industries with security,\u201d he said. Both potential administrations are likely to continue this approach.\n\n\u201cThere could be a number of impacts to global supply chains, including the prioritization of domestic investment, implementation of trade tariffs, and rebalanced and renegotiated trading relationships,\u201d Chambless said.",

[+] getty\n\nKey Facts\n\nAccording to the report, an Iranian group called Storm-2035 has launched several fake news websites targeting voters both on the left and the right with \u201cpolarizing messaging on issues such as the US presidential candidates, LGBTQ rights, and the Israel-Hamas conflict.\u201d Examples of such sites highlighted by the report include one called the \u201cNio Thinker\u201d which targets liberals by attacking Trump and another aimed at conservatives called \u201cSavannah Time\u201d which leans into LGBTQ+ issues, \u201cparticularly gender re-assignment.\u201d Microsoft researchers say they found evidence of these sites \u201cusing AI-enabled services to plagiarize at least some of their content from US publications,\u201d and other AI tools to boost their reach on search engines. Another Iran-linked group called Sefid Flood \u201cbegan staging\u201d election interference operations in March and it specializes in impersonating social and political activist groups to \u201csow doubt about election integrity\u201d and inciting violence against political figures, among other things.\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We\u2019re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day\u2019s headlines.

In June, the IRGC-backed hacking group Mint Sandstorm sent a spear-phishing email to a high-ranking official of an unnamed presidential campaign using the compromised email ID of a former senior advisor. Spear-phishing is a targeted attack aiming to steal sensitive information by getting the victim to open a malicious link or file. In this instance, the phishing email included a fake hyperlink that would direct the target to a domain controlled by the hacker, before sending him to the actual website mentioned in the link. Mint Sandstorm also unsuccessfully attempted to access an account belonging to an unnamed former presidential candidate. In May, another IRGC-linked hacker group, Peach Sandstorm, compromised a user account at a county-level government in a swing state. The report notes that the compromised account only had minimal access permission and the researchers did not observe any privilege escalation\u2014which would have targeted more sensitive accounts or data. In May, another IRGC-linked hacker group, Peach Sandstorm, compromised a user account at a county-level government in a swing state.\n\nNews Peg\n\nEarlier this year, Microsoft reported that both Russia and China were using online disinformation to create division in the U.S. and influence the outcome of the presidential election. The company\u2019s researchers found fake social media accounts run by actors with links to the Chinese Communist Party were using online polls to understand issues that strongly divide American voters. Chinese actors also reportedly used AI-generated content to sow political division among U.S. voters. Microsoft found several were trying to influence the elections by using \u201ca mix of themes from 2020 with a renewed focus on undermining US support for Ukraine.\u201d\n\nFurther Reading\n\nMicrosoft finds Russian influence operations targeting U.S. election have begun (Reuters)",

        "text": "Historic First for California: 16- and 17-Year-Olds\u2026\nIn a historic first for California, the County of Alameda, the City of Oakland, the City of Berkeley, the Oakland Unified School District, and the Berkeley Unified School District are pleased to announce that 16- and 17-year-olds in Oakland and Berkeley will be able to vote in their respective elections for school board in November 2024.\n\nThis historic expansion of the local franchise is thanks to the passage of Measure Y1, approved by over 70 percent of voters in Berkeley in 2016, and of Measure QQ, approved in 2020 with 2/3 support of Oakland voters.\n\nThe Alameda County Registrar of Voters is using California\u2019s pre-registration system\u2013the system that allows 16- and 17-year-olds to pre-register to vote in California as a whole\u2013as the system to register 16- and 17-year-olds to vote in their local school board races in Oakland or Berkeley. Therefore, a resident of Oakland or Berkeley who is 16- or 17- years old and who is otherwise eligible must use California\u2019s pre-registration system (https://registertovote.ca.gov) to register to vote as a \u201cyouth voter.\u201d Any 16- or 17- year-old residing in Oakland or Berkeley who previously pre-registered to vote will be automatically registered as a youth voter.\n\n\u201cI am very pleased to have the technology and processes in place to deliver youth voting, passed by the voters of Berkeley and Oakland through Measures Y1 and QQ,\u201d said Alameda County Registrar of Voters Tim Dupuis. \u201cThis has never been done before in California and we had to make sure that it was done properly. I would like to thank the Board of Supervisors for their support in helping make it possible for 16- and 17-year-olds in Oakland and Berkeley to vote for school board in November 2024.\u201d\n\n\u201cVoting is not just a right but a civic duty, and extending this right to 16- and 17-year-olds will foster a culture of civic participation from an early age. I am grateful to Oakland Council President Nikki Bas, Councilmember Rebecca Kaplan, and the Oakland City Clerk\u2019s team for all their hard work and leadership to make this new program a reality,\u201d said Oakland Mayor Sheng Thao.\n\n\u201cYoung people are directly affected by the decisions made by their local school boards,\u201d said OUSD Board of Education President Sam Davis. \u201cLowering the voting age to 16 ensures that their perspectives are represented in the democratic process and will compel local politicians to address their concerns.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy giving 16-17 year-olds the right to vote about their education, we help to create lifelong voters who are more likely to participate in future local and national elections,\u201d said Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arregu\u00edn. \u201cEarly involvement fosters a sense of civic duty and strengthens our democracy for generations to come.\u201d\n\n\u201cBerkeley has been working to bring youth voting to fruition for several years,\u201d said Berkeley Unified School Board President Ana Vasudeo.\u201d We\u2019re excited to empower our youth to exercise one of their most important civic duties this November.\u201d\n\nThe technical capability enabling youth to vote in this election is the culmination of years of work by the Registrar of Voters with support and direction from the Alameda County Board of Supervisors, the four involved local jurisdictions (City of Oakland, City of Berkeley, Oakland USD, and Berkeley USD), the team from Runbeck Elections Services, Inc. (the vendor for Alameda County\u2019s election management system), and community-based advocacy organizations. What might have seemed simple in 2016 when Measure Y1 was first passed turned out to require a complicated process in which every aspect of the election\u2014from voter registration to ballot mailing to ballot counting\u2014needed to be mapped, programmed, and tested specifically for youth voters. This process, while lengthy, was necessary to ensure the integrity of the election for both youth voters and traditional voters.\n\nKey Information/Dates for the November 5, 2024, election:\n\nVoter Information Guides will be mailed to all voters, including youth voters, starting Thursday, September 26, 2024.\n\nAll voters, including youth voters, will be mailed a mail ballot starting the week of October 7, 2024.\n\nThe last day for all voters, including youth voters, to register online to vote is Monday, October 21, 2024, although all voters, including youth voters, may register to vote in person at the Registrar of Voters\u2019 office (1225 Fallon St., Oakland) through Election Day.\n\nThe last day for all voters, including youth voters, to request a mail ballot replacement is Tuesday, October 29, 2024.\n\nIn addition, from when early voting begins on Monday, October 7, 2024, through Election Day on Tuesday, November 5, 2024, youth voters can vote in person at the Registrar of Voters\u2019 office (1225 Fallon St., Oakland).\n\nWithin the United States, only five small municipalities in Maryland (with a combined total population of all ages of only around 80,000) permit youth voting. Given the larger populations of Berkeley and Oakland, the potential youth vote in each of these two California cities is greater than all the Maryland municipalities combined.",

        "text": "\u2018Our lives are on the line\u2019: Why many LGBTQ+ people hope for a Harris win\nAt a recent celebration of San Francisco\u2019s vibrant transgender past, one speaker after another directed the crowd\u2019s attention to a worrisome future, casting November\u2019s presidential election as a turning point for the LGBTQ+ community and the nation as a whole.\n\n\u201cThis election will determine our fate,\u201d said Sof\u00eda Sabina R\u00edos Dorantes, deputy director of El/La Para TransLatinas, a local advocacy organization. \u201cIt will determine whether we continue to face discrimination and marginalization at [a] disproportionate rate, or whether we can continue walking toward the recognition and respect we deserve.\u201d\n\nFor the record: An earlier version of this article referred to an event in San Francisco as a celebration of Transgender Pride Month. The celebration marked Transgender History Month.\n\nLast week\u2019s third annual kickoff to Transgender History Month \u2014 the first to be recognized at the state level as well \u2014 was a chance to celebrate the advances of the transgender community in one of the nation\u2019s most enduring havens for LGBTQ+ people, with champagne served beneath the ornate dome of San Francisco City Hall. It was also a show of defiance at a dangerous time for queer folks nationally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThousands participate in the All Black Lives Matter solidarity march to mark LGBTQ Pride Month along Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood in 2020. (Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times)\n\nIn three months, Americans will choose between Vice President Kamala Harris, who is a Bay Area native and longtime LGBTQ+ ally, and former President Trump, who has a long record of attacking queer rights and has aligned himself with some of the nation\u2019s most virulently anti-LGBTQ+ political groups.\n\nIn chats with family and on nights out with friends, at gay bars and organizing meetings and on a virtual call of some 20,000 queer people last month, many LGBTQ+ Americans are making it increasingly clear that they view Trump and the broader Republican agenda as an existential threat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCalifornia Our Queerest Century With queer lives under threat, Our Queerest Century highlights the contributions of LGBTQ+ people since the 1924 founding of the nation\u2019s first gay rights organization.\n\n\u201cIt is not an exaggeration to say that our lives are on the line,\u201d said Honey Mahogany, executive director of the San Francisco Office of Transgender Initiatives. \u201cIt\u2019s whether or not we can survive \u2014 or will be in a position where we are in fear for our lives.\u201d\n\nIn advance of the 20,000-strong call hosted by the Human Rights Campaign last month, the group released a letter endorsing Harris from more than 1,100 LGBTQ+ leaders, organizers and celebrities.\n\nThe letter praised Harris for her decision as California attorney general to not defend Proposition 8, a state ballot measure that barred same-sex marriages, and for her support for the federal Equality Act, which would prohibit anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination in employment, housing and other areas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVice President Kamala Harris makes a surprise appearance at Capitol Pride DC in Washington in 2022. (Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times)\n\nThe letter heaped praise on the Biden-Harris administration as \u201cthe most pro-LGBTQ+ administration in history,\u201d noting its support for anti-discrimination policies and LGBTQ+ healthcare protections in the U.S. and its defense of LGBTQ+ rights globally.\n\nOn the call, Mawuli Tugbenyoh, senior co-chair of the Alice B. Toklas LGBTQ Democratic Club in San Francisco, said Harris has been a queer ally since before her first election as San Francisco district attorney in 2003 and is genuine in her allyship.\n\n\u201cVice President Harris has always been there for us and fought for our community every step of the way,\u201d Tugbenyoh said.\n\nOn Tuesday, queer rights groups also hailed Harris\u2019 selection of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate. They noted Walz has a record of allyship going back to the 1990s \u2014 when as a teacher he served as an advisor to his school\u2019s gay-straight alliance \u2014 and as governor has signed bills banning so-called conversion therapy and protecting gender-affirming care.\n\nThe same organizations have called Trump a major threat to queer families.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump appointed anti-LGBTQ+ officials throughout his administration. His Department of Education revoked school protections for transgender students, while his Justice and Health and Human Services departments rescinded anti-discrimination protections for transgender people, including in healthcare settings.\n\nTrump appointed a slate of judges viewed as anti-LGBTQ+ and banned transgender people from serving in the military \u2014 a policy President Biden reversed. In more recent years, Republicans aligned with Trump have introduced a flood of anti-LGBTQ+ bills at the local, state and federal levels, prompting the Human Rights Campaign to declare a \u201cstate of emergency\u201d for queer Americans last year.\n\nConcerns have only increased since Project 2025, a blueprint for a second Trump term produced by a host of former Trump aides, the Heritage Foundation and more than 100 other conservative groups, came into focus. The plan \u2014 which Trump has tried to distance himself from despite having close ties to its authors \u2014 challenges the existence of transgender people, calls the rainbow flag a \u201cdivisive symbol\u201d and demands a \u201cbiblically based\u201d definition of marriage and families.\n\nTrump\u2019s running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, who also has close ties to Project 2025 authors, has attacked LGBTQ+ rights and mocked queer people. Vance has opposed protections for same-sex marriage, LGBTQ+ workers and gender-affirming healthcare, called LGBTQ+ activists \u201cgroomers\u201d and held up the confirmation of overseas diplomats by questioning their support for LGBTQ+-friendly initiatives.\n\nTrump also has outlined various anti-LGBTQ+ policies in \u201cAgenda 47,\u201d his plan for a second term. It says Trump would end all federal programs \u201cthat promote the concept of sex and gender transition at any age,\u201d withhold Medicaid and Medicare funding from hospitals that provide gender-affirming care to children, ensure \u201csevere consequences\u201d for teachers who acknowledge transgender students\u2019 identities and revoke federal funding from their schools.\n\nHe concludes a campaign video about the plan with the demonstrably false assertion that the existence of transgender children \u201cwas never heard of\u201d until \u201cthe radical left invented it just a few years ago.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We\u2019re not going back\u2019\n\nNot all LGBTQ+ people support Harris. Stephen Schumacher, a gay 33-year-old political consultant, helps lead the Detroit chapter of Log Cabin Republicans, an organization for conservative LGBTQ+ people. He supports Trump.\n\nSchumacher pointed to the Republican Party taking its long-standing opposition to same-sex marriage out of its platform this year \u2014 after Trump ordered the document be slimmed down \u2014 as proof the party is coming around on the issue. He said Log Cabin events he attended at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee last month were well received.\n\n\u201cI feel like my rights are protected,\u201d Schumacher said.\n\nRichard Grenell, a gay Trump loyalist and former acting director of national intelligence in the Trump administration, once called Trump \u201cthe most pro-gay president in American history\u201d and this week predicted the GOP nominee will \u201cwin 50% of the gay vote.\u201d\n\nGrenell, of California, has railed against transgender youth rights and the Equality Act and been flagged as anti-LGBTQ+ by queer rights groups. On Wednesday he took up a Republican talking point about Walz, saying that Minnesota protections around sexual orientation somehow benefit pedophiles.\n\nAcross the country, many queer people find such beliefs flabbergasting \u2014 if not repugnant.\n\nJim Obergefell, the lead plaintiff in the 2015 Supreme Court case that won same-sex couples the right to marry nationally, said it\u2019s obvious that LGBTQ+ rights \u2014 including the right to marry \u2014 are under threat.\n\nJim Obergefell, the lead plaintiff in Obergefell vs. Hodges, the Supreme Court case that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, arrives for a news conference on the steps of the Texas Capitol in Austin in 2015. (Eric Gay / Associated Press)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Republican Party has made clear through statements, through policies, through basically everything they have done, that they do not believe that queer people deserve the same rights, the same respect, the same dignity,\u201d Obergefell said.\n\nRep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), who is gay and serves as chair of the Congressional Equality Caucus, said LGBTQ+ people have watched in recent years as Republicans have launched one attack after another on gender-affirming care, Pride flags, drag queen story hours, queer books and the mere mention of being gay in schools, and know it will only get worse under Trump.\n\n\u201cIn the Republican Party, there is a real regression when it comes to equality, and I could see almost anything being pushed forward,\u201d Pocan said.\n\nAmong those attending the Transgender History Month celebration in San Francisco was state Sen. Scott Wiener, who is gay. \u201cWe know that there are forces in this country \u2014 and we\u2019re seeing it more broadly now with Project 2025 \u2014 [who] have never gotten over the fact that we\u2019re no longer in 1950 or 1850 or whatever it is that they want to bring us back to,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve never gotten over that, and they want all of us to go away.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Wiener said, \u201cwe\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d\n\nDonna Personna, a 77-year-old transgender attendee who has lived in San Francisco since her teens, said Trump and other Republicans pretend people such as her never used to exist because they don\u2019t want to acknowledge that the American past they wish to see returned was a harsh and unjust place for so many.\n\nBy contrast, Harris has made \u201cWe\u2019re not going back\u201d a campaign slogan, Personna noted. \u201cAnd I\u2019m with her on that.\u201d",

        "text": "US election 2024: Harris leads Trump in three key states, new poll shows\nDemocratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris has a lead over her Republican rival Donald Trump in three battleground states that will be key in the upcoming United States election, according to a new poll.\n\nThe New York Times/Siena College poll released on Saturday showed Harris with 50 percent support among voters in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, compared with Trump\u2019s 46 percent support in each state.\n\nThe findings come just weeks after Harris launched her push for the White House following US President Joe Biden\u2019s decision last month to drop out of the race over concerns about his age and ability to serve another term in office.\n\nSince Harris formally launched her campaign, the US vice president has secured strong backing from key segments of the Democratic Party\u2019s base \u2013 notably young voters and people of colour \u2013 as well as donors and top Democratic lawmakers.\n\nHer decision to name Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her vice-presidential running mate this week also spurred a new wave of enthusiasm for the Democratic ticket.\n\nBut the Biden administration\u2019s staunch support for Israel amid the Gaza war continues to be a point of criticism, notably in Michigan, a critical swing state that is home to one of the largest Arab American populations in the US.\n\nDuring a rally in Detroit this week, Harris rebuffed a group of protesters that had interrupted her speech to demand an end to the war.\n\n\u201cYou know what, if you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I\u2019m speaking,\u201d she told the demonstrators, drawing widespread criticism from Palestinian rights advocates and other progressives.\n\nBut days later, at a rally in Arizona on Friday, Harris changed her tone when she met more protests over Gaza.\n\n\u201cThe president and I are working around the clock every day to get that ceasefire deal done and bring the hostages home. I respect your voices, but we are here to now talk about the race in 2024,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvocates have urged Harris to break from Biden\u2019s staunch support for Israel, calling on her to end weapons shipments to the US ally amid the Gaza war, among other measures.\n\nSince entering the race, Harris also has faced a barrage of attacks from Trump, the former president and Republican 2024 presidential candidate, and his running mate, JD Vance.\n\nAsked on Thursday how he has altered his approach to the new challenge from Harris, Trump insisted he has not done so.\n\nIn a question-and-answer session with reporters that lasted longer than an hour, Trump claimed Harris and Walz were weak candidates who were already dropping in the polls.\n\nDespite that, he lamented that he would not be able to face Biden in the election, suggesting that the president was a victim of an unconstitutional plot to dislodge him from atop the Democratic ticket.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign has slammed the Harris-Walz campaign as \u201cevery American\u2019s nightmare\u201d and the former president has personally attacked Harris\u2019s intelligence and racial background.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not doing any news conferences,\u201d Trump told reporters on Thursday. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know how to do a news conference. She\u2019s not smart enough to do a news conference.\u201d",

        "text": "Election 2024 updates: Trump campaign claims it was hacked by 'foreign sources'\nIn his first sit-down interview since stepping down from the 2024 race, President Joe Biden explained his historic decision.\n\n\"Look, polls we had showed that it was a neck-and-neck race, would have been down to the wire. But what happened was a number of my Democratic colleagues in the House and Senate thought that I was going to hurt them in their races,\" Biden said earlier this week in an interview with CBS News that aired on Sunday.\n\nPresident Joe Biden speaks at a news conference July 11, 2024, in Washington. Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n\nHe also pointed to the fact that he always saw himself as a transitional figure, and he said that beating Donald Trump was \"the most important thing\" for him.\n\n\"Number two, when I ran the first time, I thought of myself as being a transition president. I can't even say how old I am, it's hard for me to get out of my mouth. And, but things got moving so quickly, it didn't happen. And the combination was that I thought it was a critical issue for me still, it's not a joke, maintaining this democracy. But I thought it was important because although it's a great honor being president, I think I have an obligation to the country to do the most important thing, and that is we must, we must, we must defeat Trump,\" Biden said.\n\n\"It's a danger -- he is genuine danger to American security,\u201d Biden said. \u201cLook, we're at an inflection point in world history of the decisions we make in the last three, four years, the next three, four years determine what the next six decades look like, and democracy is the key.\"\n\n-ABC News' Michelle Stoddart",

        "text": "Will abortion be a draw for US voters in 2024? This doctor thinks so\nWittenberg, Wisconsin \u2013 For four generations, Kristin Lyerly\u2019s family has lived in the Midwestern state of Wisconsin. But in 2022, she lost the ability to fully practise her profession there.\n\nLyerly, a doctor in obstetrics and gynaecology (OBGYN), specialises in reproductive health. Part of her work involved providing abortion services in the city of Sheboygan, nestled along the shores of Lake Michigan.\n\nBut in June 2022, the conservative-led Supreme Court overturned the federal right to abortion access, paving the way for a patchwork of restrictions to crop up across the United States.\n\nIt upended Lyerly\u2019s life and practice. Almost immediately, an 1849 law that effectively banned all abortions, including in cases of rape or incest, snapped back to life in Wisconsin. Lyerly was forced to commute more than seven hours to the neighbouring state of Minnesota to continue offering her services.\n\nThat experience helped launch Lyerly into national politics \u2014 and now, she is hoping to make history as she campaigns to be one of the first reproductive health specialists to serve in Congress in defence of abortion access.\n\n\u201cThere are zero pro-abortion rights OBGYNs in Congress. Zero. This year, we can change that,\u201d Lyerly said in a June campaign video.\n\nShe is running unopposed in the Democratic primary for an open seat in the House of Representatives on August 13.\n\nBut experts say campaigns like Lyerly\u2019s will test whether abortion access remains a powerful motivator for Democratic voters, two years after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision.",

        "text": "Nebraska's 2nd District steps back into presidential spotlight after crazy month \u2022 Nebraska Examiner\nOMAHA \u2014 National and local polling in the presidential race have tightened after a wild month that ran voters through the first debate, an assassination attempt and a new nominee.\n\nAll the upheaval reset the race, leaving it closer to a tossup. This could end up amplifying the importance of Nebraska\u2019s 2nd District because of how the state awards its Electoral College votes. It and Maine award some to the statewide winner and a single vote to the winners in each of its congressional districts.\n\nHints of the Omaha area\u2019s role as a swing district keep emerging. Two examples: Former President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign opened an Omaha office, and Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 team took over the campaign staff President Joe Biden had on the ground.\n\nHarris upped the ante and increased the likelihood of bipartisan 2nd District visits by picking a Nebraskan as her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, born in West Point. His roots make it more likely both candidates will come, as Trump did in 2020.\n\nEven third-party candidate Robert Kennedy Jr., whose candidacy is dealing with controversies about a dumped bear carcass, talk of brain worms and recorded phone conversations with Trump, has said he plans to visit the Omaha area in the coming weeks.\n\nWinner-take all fight could revive\n\nThen there is the drama in Lincoln, buried for a bit by the noise from a special session Gov. Jim Pillen called this summer seeking property tax relief. Trump and his campaign vehemently want to shift the Cornhusker State to winner-take-all.\n\nThey want Nebraska, where Republicans hold a 2-to-1 registration advantage over Democrats, in the same camp as 48 other states that award all Electoral College votes to the winner of the statewide popular vote for president. Pillen wants it, too.\n\nNebraska Republican Party Chairman Eric Underwood confirmed what state senators have told the Examiner privately, that the issue is not dead for 2024, and Pillen and legislative Republicans are waiting for the right moment to bring it forward.\n\nUnderwood said so Saturday, during a rally with about 100 Republicans to open Trump\u2019s campaign office in a beige strip mall near 120th and Center Streets. He told attendees, including volunteers to help Trump, that the GOP would need their help.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a delicate opportunity,\u201d Underwood said. \u201cWhen we\u2019re ready to go I\u2019ve connected with the Trump Force team. I\u2019ve connected with Turning Point Action. \u2026 When this opportunity presents itself, what we need to do is to be the support network for those individuals because this will be a national change.\u201d\n\nTrump and his campaign have focused pressure this year on holdouts in the Nebraska Legislature. Trump has already gotten involved, calling a state lawmaker last session who told him the bill lacked the votes to advance, a call Trump later denied.\n\nState lawmakers, including the senator who shepherded the idea last session, State Sen. Loren Lippincott of Central City, have said Pillen would call another special session if he can show the governor he has 33 votes to overcome a promised filibuster.\n\n\u201cRight now, we do not,\u201d Lippincott said recently. \u201cBut I know we\u2019re all still working.\u201d\n\nDemocrats see effort to avoid risk of loss\n\nNebraska Democratic Party chairwoman Jane Kleeb has said Trump and the state\u2019s Republicans only want to change the rules because they know they\u2019re behind in a district her party celebrates on tee shirts and posters as \u201cthe blue dot.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s closer to purple and has become a district that swings with the whims of presidential politics that have ebbed back and forth from blue to red. Biden won the 2nd District in 2020. Trump won in 2016. Utah Sen. Mitt Romney won in 2012. Former President Barack Obama won in 2008.\n\nKleeb said you can almost smell the desperation of Republicans who see Trump hosting \u201chalf-empty rallies\u201d and Harris \u201cfilling arenas.\u201d She said this election, like most, hinges on turnout, not whether one party changes rules in the middle of the game.\n\n\u201cThe Republican Party and Trump himself can make as many threats as they want, but the 17 coalition Democrats, Independents and Republicans are standing strong to keep a fair election system in place,\u201d Kleeb said of the group that backed a filibuster. \u201cNo matter the bluster \u2026 they simply do not have the votes.\u201d\n\nNational political pundits have again increased the spotlight on the 2nd District by constantly repeating the possibility that the Electoral College vote could end up in a 269-269 tie that the GOP-led House would decide or the Omaha-based district could break the tie, resulting in a 270-268 win.\n\nLocal political observers used to call that a far-fetched possibility. But some poll watchers are starting to consider the idea of one district \u2014 of Douglas, Saunders and part of Sarpy Counties \u2014 deciding which person sits in the White House.\n\nRandall Adkins, a political scientist at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, has called the idea unlikely but possible. His former UNO colleague, Paul Landow, has said state lawmakers will face tremendous pressure to cave on winner-take-all.\n\nLandow has said Trump faces a balancing act of trying to change the law to advantage his campaign while still also competing in the 2nd District in case things stay the same. He also doesn\u2019t want to boost Democratic turnout by trying.\n\nIncreased presence by Trump-Harris campaigns\n\nBoth major presidential campaigns have ramped up their presence in the Omaha area in recent months. Biden was first, announcing staff hires. The Republican National Committee and Trump increased their presence in May. All are knocking doors.\n\nThe Harris campaign, in a statement Saturday, said Biden and now Harris have been on the ground in NE-02 for months, led by Doug Gray, a state director and two senior advisers, Precious McKesson and Meg Mandy. Ads are also running.\n\nSecond Gentleman Doug Emhoff, Harris\u2019 husband, was the first major surrogate of the cycle, visiting in March to meet with physicians and advocates on reproductive health and returning in July to meet with young voters and small business owners.\n\n\u201cNebraskans\u2019 rights and fundamental freedoms are on the line this November, and the Harris campaign isn\u2019t taking a single vote for granted to build a broad coalition of Democrats, Independents and Republicans to win NE-02 again,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe stakes were clear at the Trump office grand opening on Saturday. Joe Hagerty, the joint RNC and Trump campaign\u2019s Nebraska field director who handles door-knocking and more, asked the crowd to volunteer by telling them the 2nd District \u201ccould be the difference in the election.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want President Trump to get elected, and so we don\u2019t want that one electoral vote that we\u2019re responsible for to be the difference in him not winning,\u201d Hagerty said, adding that the RNC and Trump campaign were just starting their investments.\n\nGOP shows signs of coming back together\n\nUnderwood and the Nebraska GOP and county GOP leaders who had feuded during the primary election season with U.S. Rep. Don Bacon and his campaign let Bacon\u2019s campaign manager Matthew Zacher speak during the rally.\n\nZacher welcomed the chance. Republicans win when they work together, he said. And 90% of the Republicans who support Bacon against Democratic State Sen. Tony Vargas of Omaha also support Trump, and the same with Trump voters and Bacon.\n\nUnderwood called it \u201cunity on our principles.\u201d He said the party is better off being led by the grassroots than by a few people at the top and said it is healthier and admittedly a little more unpredictable than before, but better ready to harness energy for elections.\n\nThe new RNC-Trump office is next door to Bacon\u2019s campaign. The RNC and Nebraska GOP took over the office lease from the Douglas County GOP after county party funds ran low during a leadership transition to the new, more populist and pro-Trump wing.\n\n\u201cThe Trump team has been hugely helpful,\u201d Zacher said. \u201cThis last cycle of 2022, we did not have a huge presence from the RNC at the national level in this district.\u201d\n\nThe Vargas campaign issued a statement criticizing Zacher and Bacon for embracing Trump, whom Bacon has endorsed three times. It called Bacon and Trump a threat to abortion rights, Social Security and Medicare and said they would be better.\n\n\u201cBacon isn\u2019t even hiding the fact that he\u2019s relying on Trump\u2019s help to hold onto his seat and stay in Washington,\u201d it said. \u201cThat\u2019s why he\u2019ll never stand up to his extreme agenda.\u201d\n\nBeyond the presidential race, much of Saturday\u2019s rally focused on races for the State Board of Education, which Underwood\u2019s GOP has emphasized as vital to flip from current control by a political mixed group to one that is more conservative.\n\nThe group also heard from U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., and a letter from U.S. Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb. Fischer is likely running against Omaha union leader and nonpartisan candidate Dan Osborn, who is turning in signatures this month to run. Flood faces Democratic State Sen. Carol Blood of Bellevue.",

        "text": "WATCH: Donald Trump speaks at campaign event in Montana\nBOZEMAN, Mont. (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump traveled to Montana for a Friday night rally intended to drum up support for ousting the state\u2019s Democratic senator, but the former president\u2019s plane first had to divert to an airport on the other side of the Rocky Mountains because of a mechanical issue, according to airport staff.\n\nWatch the event in our player above.\n\nTrump\u2019s plane was en route to Bozeman, Montana, when it was diverted Friday afternoon to Billings, 142 miles to the east, according to Jenny Mockel, administrative assistant at Billings Logan International Airport. Trump continued to Bozeman via private jet.\n\nThe former president came to Montana hoping to remedy some unfinished business from 2018, when he campaigned repeatedly in Big Sky Country in a failed bid to oust incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Tester. On Friday, Trump ripped into the three-term senator, mocking him for being overweight and for insinuating he sometimes sided with the former president.\n\n\u201cHe voted to impeach me \u2014 that guy voted to impeach me,\u201d Trump said of Tester, whom he called a \u201cslob\u201d with \u201cthe biggest stomach I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nTrump also invited to the stage Texas Rep. Ronny Jackson, his former White House physician, to further slam Montana\u2019s senior senator. Tester sank Jackson\u2019s nomination to be Trump\u2019s Veterans Affairs secretary, alleging the doctor drank and used prescription drugs while on duty.\n\nTester has tried to convince voters he\u2019s aligned with Trump on many issues, mirroring his successful strategy from six years ago. While that worked in a non-presidential election year, it faces a more critical test this fall with Tester\u2019s opponent, former Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy, trying to link the three-term incumbent to Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump kicked off his rally about 90 minutes behind schedule and immediately began lacing into Tester. \u201cWe are going to defeat radical left Democrat Jon Tester, he\u2019s terrible,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to evict crazy Kamala,\u201d he continued, workshopping a nickname on his new rival.\n\nHarris has benefitted nationally from a burst of enthusiasm among core Democratic constituencies, who coalesced quickly around her after President Joe Biden withdrew from the campaign last month. She\u2019s drawn big crowds in swing states, touring this week with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, her choice to be her vice presidential nominee.\n\nWATCH: With Harris gaining in the polls, a look at how the electoral map has changed\n\nTrump\u2019s only rally this week, meanwhile, was in a state he won by 16 percentage points four years ago rather than a November battleground. Facing new pressure in the race from a candidate with surging enthusiasm, Trump on Thursday called questions about his lack of swing state stops \u201cstupid.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to go there because I\u2019m leading those states,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going because I want to help senators and congressmen get elected.\u201d\n\nHe will add on fundraising stops in Wyoming and Colorado.\n\nTrump could be decisive in Montana\u2019s Senate race\n\nFriday\u2019s rally at Montana State University drew thousands of GOP supporters. Yet the former president\u2019s bigger impact could be simply having his name above Sheehy\u2019s on the ballot in November, said University of Montana political analyst Rob Saldin.\n\n\u201cThere is a segment of the electorate that will turn out when Trump is on the ticket,\u201d Saldin said. And that could benefit Sheehy, a Trump supporter and newcomer to politics who made a fortune off an aerial firefighting business.\n\nRepublicans have been on a roll in Montana for more than a decade and now hold every statewide office except for Tester\u2019s.\n\nTester won each of his previous Senate contests by a narrow margin, casting himself as a plainspoken farmer who builds personal connections with people in Montana and is willing to break with his party on issues that matter to them. He\u2019s also become a prolific fundraiser.\n\nWATCH: Undecided voters explain how the election shakeups have shifted their views\n\nThe race has drawn national attention with Democrats clinging to a razor-thin majority in the Senate and defending far more seats than the GOP this year. Tester is considered among the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents.\n\nFor him to win, large numbers of Trump supporters would have to vote a split ticket and get behind the Democratic senator.\n\nTrump\u2019s drive to oust Tester traces back to the lawmaker\u2019s work in 2018 as chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs. Tester revealed past misconduct by Trump\u2019s personal physician, Ronny Jackson, that sank Jackson\u2019s nomination to lead the Veterans Affairs Department\n\nThen-President Trump took the matter personally and came to Montana four times to campaign for Republican Matt Rosendale, who was then the state auditor. Rosendale lost by 3 percentage points.\n\nTester has positioned himself apart from national Democrats\n\nBefore Trump\u2019s latest visit, Tester has sought to insulate himself against charges that he\u2019s part of the Democratic establishment by rolling out the names of Republicans who support him, including former Montana Gov. Marc Racicot. His campaign highlighted more than 20 pieces of legislation, many dealing with veterans\u2019 issues, that Tester sponsored and Trump signed.\n\nTester also was the sole Democratic delegate from Montana to withhold a vote backing Harris as the party\u2019s presidential candidate in the wake of Biden\u2019s withdrawal. And when the Democratic National Convention takes place later this month in Chicago, Tester will be back in Montana \u201cfarming and meeting face to face with Montanans,\u201d campaign spokesperson Harry Child said.\n\nThe last time Tester attended the Democratic National Convention was in 2008. That\u2019s also the last time a Democratic presidential candidate came anywhere near winning Montana, with President Barack Obama losing by just over 2 percentage points.\n\nOn Friday, in an interview as he waited for the Trump rally to start, Sheehy dismissed the idea that Tester can survive Montana\u2019s swing to the right. \u201cJon Tester is by 95 percent-plus in lockstep with the Biden-Harris agenda,\u201d Sheehy said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t think his attempt to message himself as a moderate is going to work.\u201d\n\nA similar situation is developing in Ohio, where three-term Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown faces a tough race in a state expected to vote for Trump.\n\nWATCH: How the Harris 2024 campaign affects Democratic candidates and ballot initiatives\n\nHarris visited Ohio when the two were Senate colleagues to raise money for Brown\u2019s 2018 campaign, but Brown has said he has no plans to campaign with her this year. Like Tester, Brown has highlighted legislation he worked on that Trump signed into law.\n\nFriday\u2019s rally took place in Gallatin County, which Tester has become increasingly reliant on over the course of his political career.\n\nHe lost the county in his first Senate race, in 2006, but his support has since grown. A substantial margin of victory in Gallatin in 2018 helped push him ahead of Rosendale.\n\nRepublican Don Seifert, a former Gallatin County commissioner, said he voted for Tester that year and plans to do so again this year.\n\nSeifert backed Trump in 2016 and said he has continued to support other Republicans, including Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte and Sen. Steve Daines.\n\n\u201cMontanans tend to vote for the person over the party,\u201d Seifert said. \u201cFor the state of Montana, Jon is the one that can do what we need.\u201d\n\nBut Sheehy says Tester has lost touch with his home state and fallen into step with Democrats in Washington. The Republican said in a message this week to supporters that Tester was \u201cresponsible for the rise of Kamala Harris\u201d because he served as chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee from 2015 to 2017, when she was elected to the Senate from California.\n\nTester has outraised Sheehy by more than three-to-one in campaign donations reported to the Federal Election Commission. However, outside groups supporting Sheehy have helped the Republican make up much of that gap. Spending in the race is on track to exceed $200 million as advertisements from the two sides saturate Montana\u2019s airwaves.\n\nAssociated Press reporters Amy Beth Hanson in Helena, Montana, and Julie Smyth in Columbus, Ohio, contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Joe Biden explains why he dropped out of White House race\nBiden explains why he dropped out of White House race\n\nBiden on stepping aside: 'We must defeat Trump'\n\nUS President Joe Biden says he dropped out of his re-election bid because he feared that the intraparty battle over his candidacy would be a \"real distraction\" for Democrats and that his highest priority was to defeat Donald Trump in November. In his first interview since quitting the race, Mr Biden, 81, said he had \u201cno serious problem\u201d with his health. He blamed his poor debate performance on being sick at the time, and brushed off concerns about his age and mental acuity. The US president pledged to campaign for Kamala Harris saying he was going to do whatever his vice-president \"thinks I can do to help most\". \u201cWe must, we must, we must defeat Trump,\u201d he told US broadcaster CBS News.\n\nMr Biden said if he had continued his campaign, the presidential contest would have gone \u201cdown to the wire\u201d. \"A number of my Democratic colleagues in the House and Senate thought that I was going to hurt them in the races,\" he said. \"And I was concerned if I stayed in the race, that would be the topic. You\u2019d be interviewing me about, Why did Nancy Pelosi say, why did so \u2014 and I thought it\u2019d be a real distraction.\u201d Former House speaker Nancy Pelosi was widely reported to have led the push to oust Mr Biden - a claim she has not exactly denied - after his halting debate performance against Trump on 27 June. During the pre-recorded interview broadcast Sunday, Mr Biden misspoke several times but generally seemed more coherent than during the live televised debate. He chalked up his poor debate performance to illness \u2013 previously he\u2019s also mentioned jet lag and lack of rest as factors. As pressure continued to ratchet up, he announced his exit from the race on 21 July. A potential battle to replace him at the top of the Democratic ticket never materialised and party support swiftly coalesced around Vice-President Harris, who has so far outperformed Mr Biden in opinion polls. The president has said he intended to be a bridge to the next generation when he ran for the White House in 2020. \"When I ran the first time, I thought of myself as being a transition president. I can't even say how old I am. It's hard for me to get it out of my mouth.\u201d\n\nAFP President Biden rides his bike through Gordons Pond State Park in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware on Sunday\n\nIn other US election news: Republican vice-presidential candidate and Ohio senator JD Vance has defended a sweeping deportation plan for undocumented migrants if he and Donald Trump are elected.\n\nMr Vance told American broadcaster ABC News that a second Trump administration would start with 1 million people who are in the United States illegally. Government figures indicate that there are around 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country, a figure that has remained largely steady since 2005.\n\nThe Ohio senator said his previous remarks suggesting parents should get additional votes were a \u201cthought experiment\u201d made in response to Democratic Party suggestions about lowering the voting age.\n\nHe said that his comments in 2021 were not a policy proposal and that he did not support extra votes for people with children. \u201cI want us to be more pro-family,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Vice-President Kamala Harris told a crowd in Las Vegas that she supported ending taxes on tips, a proposal also backed by Trump. The battleground state of Nevada is home to a substantial number of voters who work in the hospitality and tourism industry.\n\nAnd following false remarks earlier in the week about the size of his crowds, Donald Trump took to his Truth Social network Sunday to accuse the Harris campaign of creating a \u201cfake photo\u201d of a rally crowd. However photos and videos from the event in question, held in Detroit, show large numbers of people turning out to see the Democratic nominees.\n\nIn the CBS interview, Mr Biden returned to the moment he decided to run against Trump \u2013 when a gathering of far-right activists in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017 turned deadly. He accused Trump of emboldening racists and the far-right. \u201cEvery other time the Ku Klux Klan has been involved they wore hoods so they're not identified,\u201d he said. \u201cUnder his presidency, they came out of those woods with no hoods, knowing they had an ally.\u201d He also repeated his concerns about what might happen after November\u2019s election, saying he was \u201cnot confident at all\u201d that there will be a peaceful transfer of power if Ms Harris defeats Trump. He went on to say that he was concerned that there would be violence if Trump loses the election. \"He means what he says,\u201d Mr Biden said. \u201cWe don't take him seriously. He means it. All the stuff about, 'If we lose, it'll be a bloodbath\u2019.\u201d \"He's a genuine danger to American security,\u201d Mr Biden said. Trump commented at a rally in March that it would \u201cbe a bloodbath for the country\u201d if he loses, however his campaign has repeatedly said he was referring to the economy and the auto industry and that Democrats have taken the quote out of context. At the same time, the former president has repeatedly insisted, without evidence, that he was cheated out of victory in 2020 and has warned that there will be attempts to \u201crig\u201d the vote this year. He has pledged to pardon some or all of the people convicted for rioting at the US Capitol in January 2021. Mr Biden said he would be campaigning on behalf of Ms Harris and that he had spoken to Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro about touring the state. Mr Biden was born in the working-class city of Scranton, about 120 miles (190km) north-west of New York City. \u201cI'm going to be campaigning in other states as well. And I'm going to do whatever Kamala thinks I can do to help most,\u201d he said.",

        "text": "Trump election campaign accuses Iran of hacking attack\nClaim comes amid reports of foreign efforts to interfere in US presidential election.\n\nUS presidential candidate Donald Trump has accused Iran of hacking his campaign.\n\nThe Republican nominee\u2019s campaign team issued a statement late on Saturday claiming that the Iranian government stole and distributed sensitive internal documents. The accusation came after Microsoft issued a report detailing foreign attempts to interfere in this year\u2019s US election campaign.\n\nThe campaign team cited past tensions between Trump and Iran but did not provide direct evidence.\n\n\u201cThese documents were obtained illegally from foreign sources hostile to the United States, intended to interfere with the 2024 election and sow chaos throughout our democratic process,\u201d campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said.\n\nLate on Saturday, Trump posted on his Truth Social app that Microsoft had informed the campaign that Iran had hacked one of its websites, but said they were \u201conly able to get publicly available information\u201d.\n\nA report by Politico just ahead of the accusation said an anonymous source had offered to supply to the US outlet documents from inside Trump\u2019s operation, including a report about running mate JD Vance\u2019s \u201cpotential vulnerabilities\u201d.\n\nA spokesperson for the National Security Council said in a statement that it takes any report of foreign interference \u201cextremely seriously\u201d and condemns any entity that attempts to undermine US democratic institutions.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s report stated that \u201cforeign malign influence concerning the 2024 US election started off slowly but has steadily picked up pace over the last six months, due initially to Russian operations but more recently from Iranian activity\u201d.\n\nIran\u2019s permanent mission to the UN in New York said in an email that \u201cthe Iranian government neither possesses nor harbors any intent or motive to interfere in the United States presidential election\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe do not accord any credence to such reports,\u201d it said in response to the Trump campaign\u2019s allegations.\n\nIran\u2019s UN mission told the Reuters news agency its cyber capabilities were \u201cdefensive and proportionate to the threats it faces\u201d, and that it had no plans to launch such cyberattacks.\n\nTehran has poor relations with Trump. During his presidency, the US killed Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani in 2020 and withdrew from a multilateral Iran nuclear deal.\n\n\u201cThe Iranians know that President Trump will stop their reign of terror just like he did in his first four years in the White House,\u201d Cheung said.\n\nThe suspect in Trump\u2019s assassination attempt in July had no ties to Iran, but a CNN report last month stated that US intelligence had uncovered an Iranian plot against Trump. Iran denied the charges.\n\nThe US Department of Justice this past week unsealed criminal charges against Pakistani national Asif Merchant, with ties to Iran and who is alleged to have plotted assassination attempts against political figures in the US, including Trump.",

        "text": "Democrats bask in optimism of Harris surge: \u2018Enthusiasm is off the charts\u2019\nWith Kamala Harris now poised to take on Donald Trump in the 5 November US presidential election, her fellow Democrats are enjoying a resurgence of optimism that was sorely lacking for much of this year, as Joe Biden struggled through a bumpy re-election campaign that he ultimately abandoned.\n\nSince the president\u2019s stumbling performance in his late June debate against Trump and his shock decision to withdraw from the race weeks later, Harris has rapidly ascended to become the party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee. Polls have shown her drawing even with, and sometimes overtaking, Trump in the support of voters nationally, and in the handful of crucial swing states that will determine the election.\n\nThe vice-president has pressed her attack by holding energetic rallies across the country, most recently with Tim Walz, the Minnesota governor who Harris this week selected as her running mate. Democratic strategists and activists say Harris has given the party a much-needed reset after months of jitters over whether Biden\u2019s struggling candidacy was setting the party up for a historic wipeout.\n\n\u201cAmong the base, the enthusiasm is off the charts, probably the most excited I\u2019ve seen people since the Obama campaign,\u201d said Ben Tribbett, a Democratic strategist in Virginia. \u201cAnd I think a lot of that has to do with a sense of relief. I think people really felt like we were in a situation that was unfixable and untenable.\u201d\n\nBiden resoundingly defeated Trump in the 2020 election, but in the years that followed, the former president strengthened his grip on the Republican party, while his Democratic successor struggled to maintain the support of voters as the US economy weathered its worst bout of inflation since the 1980s, and voters grew skeptical of the 81-year-old\u2019s ability to do the job.\n\nView image in fullscreen Supporters cheer as Kamala Harris speaks during a campaign rally at UAW Local 900 in Wayne, Michigan, on 8 August. Photograph: Julia Nikhinson/AP\n\nTrump swept the Republican primaries at the start of the year, while Biden embarked on a re-election campaign with arguments that Trump was unfit to serve, and posed a threat to democracy and reproductive freedom.\n\nBut despite the former president\u2019s conviction in May on felony business fraud charges and three pending criminal cases against him, polls showed that Biden never gained a clear advantage over Trump, particularly in the six states \u2013 Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona and Georgia \u2013 expected to decide the election.\n\nWorse still for Democrats was the possibility that Biden\u2019s presence on ballots nationwide would harm the party\u2019s chances of regaining the majority in the House of Representatives, and keeping control of the Senate, particularly after he struggled to articulate his points and parry Trump\u2019s attacks in their debate.\n\nThat nervousness has, at least for now, been alleviated by Biden\u2019s decision to bow out and endorse Harris, a former California senator who made an unsuccessful bid for the party\u2019s nomination in 2020, and who would be the first Black female president, as well as the first of south Asian descent, if elected.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like just a big sigh of relief,\u201d said Iva King, who co-leads a group of the progressive Indivisible movement in Athens, Georgia. \u201cA lot of us really appreciated President Biden. I think he has done a great job. But like many people around the country, after we saw the debate, it was like, oh, this isn\u2019t looking good.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Harris arrives at a campaign rally in Romulus, Michigan, on Wednesday. Photograph: Julia Nikhinson/AP\n\nPublic opinion surveys taken since Harris launched her campaign have shown the vice-president with a level of support that the Biden campaign did not have.\n\nA slew of recent national polls show her with the lead over Trump nationally, though in swing states they have been less conclusive about which candidate is ahead. Nonetheless, two major forecasters, Cook Political Report and the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics, this week announced new ratings that moved swing states where they previously believed Tump had a narrow lead back into their toss-up category.\n\n1:24 'I respect your voices': Harris responds to pro-Palestinian protesters during rally \u2013 video\n\nWhile noting that Trump has stronger poll numbers than he did at this point four years ago, Cook Political Report\u2019s editor-in-chief, Amy Walter, said: \u201cFor the first time in a long time, Democrats are united and energized, while Republicans are on their heels. Unforced errors from both Trump and his vice-presidential nominee, JD Vance, have shifted the media spotlight from Biden\u2019s age to Trump\u2019s liabilities. In other words, the presidential contest has moved from one that was Trump\u2019s to lose to a much more competitive contest.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Trump\u2019s running mate, the Ohio senator JD Vance, questioned Walz\u2019s military service after his selection this week.\n\nDan Moore, a member of Wisconsin\u2019s Grassroots Menomonee Falls Area, which is affiliated with Indivisible, credited Harris with energizing Democratic faithful and shifting the age conversation from Biden to Trump, who is 78. But he warned of the potency of attacking the vice-president as a \u201cCalifornia liberal\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think that has the ability to get some traction, and it\u2019s just something that I hear from people\u201d who say, \u201cshe\u2019s way too liberal for me\u201d, Moore said.\n\nSome of Trump and Vance\u2019s arguments have backfired. Trump drew condemnation for questioning Harris\u2019s identity as African American, while Vance is on the defensive after comments of him dismissing Democrats as \u201ca bunch of childless cat ladies\u201d resurfaced. On Wednesday, the prominent Republican strategist Karl Rove issued a public warning in the editorial pages of the Wall Street Journal, which are closely read by conservatives.\n\n\u201cThe Trump-Vance ticket needs to become much more disciplined and settle soon on an effective line of attack against Harris-Walz that wins over swing voters and then stick to it. If it can\u2019t achieve both these goals, a race Mr Trump was on the verge of winning three weeks ago could be lost,\u201d Rove wrote.\n\nPlenty can change in the less than three months remaining before election day, and Republicans have further avenues of attack, including lingering discontent over inflation, Tribbett said.\n\nBut Harris will have more opportunities to reintroduce herself to the public, including her 10 September debate against Trump. More pivotally will be her address at the Democratic national convention in Chicago later this month, where she will have the chance to further enliven a Democratic base that has already been fired up by her candidacy.\n\n\u201cI think if she does it right, I think she will emerge from the convention with a bounce,\u201d he said. \u201cIf she\u2019s fully engaged the Democratic base, that bounce will put her in the lead everywhere.\u201d",

        "text": "The Trump campaign says its emails were hacked and suggests Iran may be to blame\nThe Trump campaign says its emails were hacked and suggests Iran may be to blame\n\ntoggle caption Ben Gray/AP\n\nFormer President Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign said Saturday that it has been hacked and suggested Iranian actors were involved in stealing and distributing sensitive internal documents.\n\nThe campaign provided no specific evidence of Iran's involvement, but the claim comes a day after Microsoft issued a report detailing foreign agents\u2019 attempts to interfere in the U.S. campaign in 2024.\n\nIt cited an instance of an Iranian military intelligence unit in June sending \u201ca spear-phishing email to a high-ranking official of a presidential campaign from a compromised email account of a former senior advisor.\u201d\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung blamed the hack on \u201cforeign sources hostile to the United States.\u201d A spokesperson for the National Security Council said in a statement that it takes any report of improper foreign interference \u201cextremely seriously\u201d and condemns any government or entity that attempts to undermine confidence in U.S. democratic institutions, but said it deferred to the Justice Department on this matter.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIran\u2019s mission to the United Nations, when asked about the claim of the Trump campaign, denied being involved. \u201cWe do not accord any credence to such reports,\u201d the mission told The Associated Press. \u201cThe Iranian government neither possesses nor harbors any intent or motive to interfere in the United States presidential election.\u201d\n\nHowever, Iran long has been suspected of running hacking campaigns targeting its enemies in the Middle East and beyond. Tehran also long has threatened to retaliate against Trump over the 2020 drone strike he ordered that killed prominent Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department this past week unsealed criminal charges against a Pakistani national with ties to Iran alleged to have plotted assassination attempts against political figures in the United States, including potentially Trump, and to have sought to hire purported hitmen who were actually undercover law enforcement officials. Court documents in that case pointedly noted a desire by Iran to conduct operations against perceived enemies of the regime and to avenge the killing of Soleimani.\n\nPolitico first reported Saturday on the hack. The outlet reported that it began receiving emails on July 22 from an anonymous account. The source \u2014 an AOL email account identified only as \u201cRobert\u201d \u2014 passed along what appeared to be a research dossier the campaign had apparently done on the Republican vice presidential nominee, Ohio Sen. JD Vance. The document was dated Feb. 23, almost five months before Trump selected Vance as his running mate.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cThese documents were obtained illegally\u201d and \u201cintended to interfere with the 2024 election and sow chaos throughout our Democratic process,\u201d Cheung said.\n\nHe pointed to the Microsoft report issued Friday and its conclusions that \u201cIranian hackers broke into the account of a \u2018high ranking official\u2019 on the U.S. presidential campaign in June 2024, which coincides with the close timing of President Trump\u2019s selection of a vice presidential nominee.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Iranians know that President Trump will stop their reign of terror just like he did in his first four years in the White House,\u201d Cheung said, adding a warning that \u201cany media or news outlet reprinting documents or internal communications are doing the bidding of America\u2019s enemies and doing exactly what they want.\u201d\n\nCheung did not immediately respond to questions about the campaign's interactions with Microsoft on the matter. Microsoft said Saturday it had no comment beyond its blog post and Friday report.\n\nIn that report, Microsoft stated that \u201cforeign malign influence concerning the 2024 US election started off slowly but has steadily picked up pace over the last six months due initially to Russian operations, but more recently from Iranian activity.\u201d\n\nThe analysis continued: \u201cIranian cyber-enabled influence operations have been a consistent feature of at least the last three U.S. election cycles. Iran\u2019s operations have been notable and distinguishable from Russian campaigns for appearing later in the election season and employing cyberattacks more geared toward election conduct than swaying voters.\"\n\n\u201cRecent activity suggests the Iranian regime \u2014 along with the Kremlin \u2014 may be equally engaged in election 2024,\u201d Microsoft concluded.\n\nSpecifically, the report detailed that in June 2024, an Iranian military intelligence unit, Mint Sandstorm, sent a phishing email to an American presidential campaign via the compromised account of a former adviser.\n\n\u201cThe phishing email contained a fake forward with a hyperlink that directs traffic through an actor-controlled domain before redirecting to the listed domain,\u201d the report states.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nVice President Kamala Harris' campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the reported hacking or on the Democratic nominee's cybersecurity protocols.",

Talking to 'The New Yorker' in an interview, she narrated the role she had played in putting pressure on Biden. After Biden's dismal performance at the June 27 presidential debate that proved a disaster for him and the party, Pelosi was convinced the incumbent president could not win the November 5 poll.Pelosi told David Remnick that she didn\u2019t see a path to victory for Joe Biden after he appeared lost while speaking, he could not complete his thoughts, and trailed off before saying \u201c...anyway\u201d. She found him incoherent and struggling to find the right words.The former House speaker said she had faith in the president and thought him great, but the June 27 debate was stunning and everyone was stunned at what happened during it. She said that she was quite impressed by the campaign apparatus and thought that he had won an election. But after his performance at the first presidential debate with Republican contender Donald Trump, she was convinced that it was not happening this time.Earlier Nancy Pelosi avoided speaking on this issue and downplayed her role and involvement in the behind-the-scenes conversations that led to Biden quitting the race. She told 'CBS Sunday Morning', that she did not make a single call about her worries about the president. Elaborating on this, she told Remnick that she never called one person, but people were calling her saying that there was a challenge there. But after more and more lawmakers, peers and senior members of the Democratic Party called her and expressed their concerns, she concluded that the president should step aside in the interest of the party.Nancy Pelosi said she did not make a single call about her worries about the president.

        "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s campaign says its emails were hacked\nFormer President Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign said Saturday that it has been hacked and suggested Iranian actors were involved in stealing and distributing sensitive internal documents.\n\nThe campaign provided no specific evidence of Iran\u2019s involvement, but the claim comes a day after Microsoft issued a report detailing foreign agents\u2019 attempts to interfere in the U.S. campaign in 2024.\n\nIt cited an instance of an Iranian military intelligence unit in June sending \u201ca spear-phishing email to a high-ranking official of a presidential campaign from a compromised email account of a former senior advisor.\u201d\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung blamed the hack on \u201cforeign sources hostile to the United States.\u201d A spokesperson for the National Security Council said in a statement that it takes any report of improper foreign interference \u201cextremely seriously\u201d and condemns any government or entity that attempts to undermine confidence in U.S. democratic institutions, but said it deferred to the Justice Department on this matter.\n\nIran\u2019s mission to the United Nations, when asked about the claim of the Trump campaign, denied being involved. \u201cWe do not accord any credence to such reports,\u201d the mission told The Associated Press. \u201cThe Iranian government neither possesses nor harbors any intent or motive to interfere in the United States presidential election.\u201d\n\nHowever, Iran long has been suspected of running hacking campaigns targeting its enemies in the Middle East and beyond. Tehran also long has threatened to retaliate against Trump over the 2020 drone strike he ordered that killed prominent Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department this past week unsealed criminal charges against a Pakistani national with ties to Iran alleged to have plotted assassination attempts against political figures in the United States, including potentially Trump, and to have sought to hire purported hitmen who were actually undercover law enforcement officials. Court documents in that case pointedly noted a desire by Iran to conduct operations against perceived enemies of the regime and to avenge the killing of Soleimani.\n\nPolitico first reported Saturday on the hack. The outlet reported that it began receiving emails on July 22 from an anonymous account. The source \u2014 an AOL email account identified only as \u201cRobert\u201d \u2014 passed along what appeared to be a research dossier the campaign had apparently done on the Republican vice presidential nominee, Ohio Sen. JD Vance. The document was dated Feb. 23, almost five months before Trump selected Vance as his running mate.\n\n\u201cThese documents were obtained illegally\u201d and \u201cintended to interfere with the 2024 election and sow chaos throughout our Democratic process,\u201d Cheung said.\n\nHe pointed to the Microsoft report issued Friday and its conclusions that \u201cIranian hackers broke into the account of a \u2018high ranking official\u2019 on the U.S. presidential campaign in June 2024, which coincides with the close timing of President Trump\u2019s selection of a vice presidential nominee.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Iranians know that President Trump will stop their reign of terror just like he did in his first four years in the White House,\u201d Cheung said, adding a warning that \u201cany media or news outlet reprinting documents or internal communications are doing the bidding of America\u2019s enemies and doing exactly what they want.\u201d\n\nCheung did not immediately respond to questions about the campaign\u2019s interactions with Microsoft on the matter. Microsoft said Saturday it had no comment beyond its blog post and Friday report.\n\nIn that report, Microsoft stated that \u201cforeign malign influence concerning the 2024 US election started off slowly but has steadily picked up pace over the last six months due initially to Russian operations, but more recently from Iranian activity.\u201d\n\nThe analysis continued: \u201cIranian cyber-enabled influence operations have been a consistent feature of at least the last three U.S. election cycles. Iran\u2019s operations have been notable and distinguishable from Russian campaigns for appearing later in the election season and employing cyberattacks more geared toward election conduct than swaying voters.\u201d\n\n\u201cRecent activity suggests the Iranian regime \u2014 along with the Kremlin \u2014 may be equally engaged in election 2024,\u201d Microsoft concluded.\n\nSpecifically, the report detailed that in June 2024, an Iranian military intelligence unit, Mint Sandstorm, sent a phishing email to an American presidential campaign via the compromised account of a former adviser.\n\n\u201cThe phishing email contained a fake forward with a hyperlink that directs traffic through an actor-controlled domain before redirecting to the listed domain,\u201d the report states.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris\u2019 campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the reported hacking or on the Democratic nominee\u2019s cybersecurity protocols.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Mae Anderson in New York, Fatima Hussein in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, and Eric Tucker in Washington contributed to this report.",

        "text": "August 10, 2024, presidential campaign news\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz attends a campaign rally in Glendale, Arizona, on August 9. Go Nakamura/Reuters\n\nDonald Trump on Friday attacked Tim Walz\u2019s progressive policies in the former president\u2019s first campaign rally since the Minnesota governor became Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 running mate.\n\nAt a rally in Bozeman, Montana, Trump highlighted bills that Walz signed that expanded health care coverage for undocumented immigrants in Minnesota and that mandated that schools provide free menstrual products in all restrooms \u2013 for both girls and boys \u2013 regularly used by students in grades 4 to 12. He criticized Walz\u2019s handling of the civil unrest that followed the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020 and pointed to recent remarks the governor made that \u201cone person\u2019s socialism is another person\u2019s neighborliness.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not talking about him, I\u2019m talking about her. This is her ideology, that\u2019s why she picked him,\u201d Trump said of Harris, whom he spent much of his campaign speech attacking.\n\nTrump made a quick reference to the forceful attacks about Walz\u2019s military service that the former president\u2019s running mate, JD Vance, has deployed against the governor all week.\n\nWhile Montana is reliably red, the state is hosting a pivotal Senate race, with Republicans looking to unseat Democratic Sen. Jon Tester this year. Trump on Friday praised Tester\u2019s GOP opponent, retired Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy, saying, \u201cHis really is valor. It\u2019s valor for heroism award. You know, the other one talks about valor, he has a different kind of a valor, it\u2019s the opposite.\u201d\n\nBackground: Vance has accused Walz of \u201cstolen valor\u201d for language he used in a 2018 speech advocating an assault weapons ban, which the Harris campaign has included in a video on social media. Walz at the time said he wanted to \u201cmake sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at.\u201d Walz never deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq or a combat zone as part of his service.",

        "text": "President Biden explains why he exited 2024 race in \"CBS Sunday Morning\" interview\nPresident Biden, who has long said he ran for the White House in 2020 due to his alarm about former President Donald Trump, decided to exit the 2024 presidential race last month. He says his decision, in part, was driven by his belief that he needed to keep the nation's focus on Trump and unite the Democratic Party ahead of the November election.\n\nIn an interview with \"CBS News Sunday Morning,\" Mr. Biden told CBS News chief election and campaign correspondent Robert Costa more about his historic decision not to seek reelection, echoing his previous statement that he would serve as a transitional figure in American presidential politics.\n\n\"When I ran the first time, I thought of myself as being a transition president,\" Mr. Biden, 81, told Costa. \"I can't even say how old I am \u2013 it's hard for me to get it out of my mouth.\"\n\nBiden expressed support for Vice President Kamala Harris, who is set to be nominated as the Democrats' standard-bearer at the party's national convention in Chicago this month.\n\n\"We must, we must, we must defeat Trump,\" Biden said in the interview, which took place in the Treaty Room in the White House residence.\n\n\"Although it's a great honor to be a president, I think I have an obligation to the country to do what I-- most important thing you can do. And that is \u2014 we must, we must, we must defeat Trump,\" he said.\n\nMr. Biden announced he was exiting the 2024 race and endorsed Harris as the Democratic Party's nominee on Sunday, July 21 \u2014 nearly a month after his debate against Trump, which concerned some of his Democratic colleagues and prompted dozens to call for him to withdraw.\n\nIn an Oval Office address on July 24, Mr. Biden said \"nothing, nothing, can come in the way of saving our democracy,\" including his ambition for a second term.\n\nA CBS News poll released on Aug. 4 showed Harris gaining momentum with a 1-point edge nationally and a tie across the battleground states. Mr. Biden was down by 5 points when he left the race.\n\nHarris is hoping Tim Walz, the upbeat two-term governor of Minnesota, will give her Democratic ticket another boost and help her win over pivotal battleground states.",

But this time, it\u2019s the Iranians, not the Russians, making the first significant move.\n\nOn Friday, Microsoft released a report declaring that a hacking group run by the intelligence unit of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps had successfully breached the account of a \u201cformer senior adviser\u201d to a presidential campaign. From that account, Microsoft said, the group sent fake email messages, known as \u201cspear phishing,\u201d to \u201ca high-ranking official of a presidential campaign\u201d in an effort to break into the campaign\u2019s own accounts and databases.\n\nBy Saturday night, former President Donald J. Trump was declaring that Microsoft had informed his campaign \u201cthat one of our many websites was hacked by the Iranian Government \u2014 Never a nice thing to do!\u201d but that the hackers had obtained only \u201cpublicly available information.\u201d He attributed it all to what he called, in his signature selective capitalization, a \u201cWeak and Ineffective\u201d Biden administration.\n\nThe facts were murkier, and it is unclear what, if anything, the Iranian group, which Microsoft called Mint Sandstorm, was able to achieve.",

        "text": "How Rupert Murdoch helped create a monster \u2013 the era of Trumpism \u2013 and then lost control of it\nYou can\u2019t help but feel sorry for Rupert Murdoch.\n\nIn Mary Shelley\u2019s famous novel, Dr Frankenstein created a monster that took on a life of its own, and which he could no longer control. Murdoch has outdone Frankenstein and created two monsters over which he has now lost control. They have left him floundering and threaten to inflict great damage on US democracy.\n\nMurdoch\u2019s first monster is the Fox News audience, which after long cultivation into the Fox News fantasy land, refuses to believe any news that does not fit its prejudices. Fox, as a result, feels compelled to reinforce its delusions rather than report accurately.\n\nMurdoch\u2019s second monster grew out of the first \u2013 a Donald Trump-dominated Republican Party. Murdoch wanted to make Trump a \u201cnon-person\u201d, but the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee last month showed Trump now dominates the party like no one else in living memory.\n\n\u2018Red meat\u2019 to conservatives\n\nWhen Fox News began in 1996, the chief executive for its first 20 years, Roger Ailes, said:\n\nRupert Murdoch and I and, by the way, the vast majority of the American people believe that most of the news tilts to the left.\n\nBut Fox News was never just a mainstream news service with a somewhat more conservative centre of gravity. From the beginning, it was more of a propaganda machine, and this became increasingly pronounced over the years. More and more, its prime-time offerings consisted of commentary rather than news programs, designed to feed \u201cred meat\u201d to the Republican base.\n\nNews that didn\u2019t fit increasingly didn\u2019t appear. So, when the Iraq war began, there was noisy flag-waving, but as it became militarily messier, the network gave it much less attention, although there were always efforts to find a positive gloss.\n\nDuring Barack Obama\u2019s first presidential term, Fox News acted as a recruiting and publicity vehicle for the far-right, populist Tea Party. It gave oxygen to Trump\u2019s baseless claim that Obama was not born in the United States, and therefore was not eligible to be president. Fox News host Glenn Beck asserted Obama was a racist with a deep-seated hatred for white people.\n\nDuring the COVID pandemic, it often denied the severity of the virus, and gave publicity to anti-vaxxer views and quack cures.\n\nEvan Vucci/AP\n\nAnd after Trump\u2019s election defeat in 2020, many Fox News viewers were ready to believe his claims of electoral fraud. Overwhelmingly, however, the key players at Fox News and in the Murdoch stable believed the election was fair.\n\nFox News\u2019s chief political correspondent Bret Baier saw \u201cno evidence of fraud. None.\u201d Murdoch\u2019s New York Post urged Trump to accept the result. In an editorial, the tabloid said his \u201cbaseless\u201d stolen election rhetoric \u201cundermines faith in democracy and faith in the nation\u201d.\n\nA new threat and new strategy\n\nVery soon, a sense of crisis overcame Fox News. Its prime-time ratings had fallen, and by some measures, CNN was now ahead. What most spooked the network\u2019s management, however, was that two small news operations, Newsmax and One America News Network (OAN), which were even more right-wing than Fox, were being publicly praised by Trump and had picked up viewers.\n\nFox\u2019s sense of crisis led it on a fateful path. It may have been a panicky overreaction.\n\nA post-election decline in viewership \u2013 especially among those of the losing party \u2013 is not unusual. After Obama\u2019s victory, for example, Fox quickly regained ground, becoming the strongest opposition voice against the new administration. Moreover, even though Newsmax had picked up viewers, its total audience was still minuscule compared to Fox\u2019s, and neither it nor OAN had anything like the resources needed to compete effectively with Fox.\n\nSix days after the election, on November 9 2020, Fox News executives nonetheless committed the network to push \u201cnarratives that would entice their audience back\u201d. In the double-talk of Fox News management, they resolved to \u201crespect\u201d their audience, by which they meant reinforce their delusions.\n\nThis resulted in a mammoth turnaround. Within two weeks, Fox News had questioned the election result 774 times, according to Media Matters for America.\n\nThe fact this switch of strategy meant the network was deliberately promoting a falsehood seems not to have troubled any of them. Nor did the fact that they were, in the words of their sister publication, the Post, undermining faith in democracy and the nation. The key thing was that the audiences came back.\n\nThe truth comes out\n\nNow focused on promoting claims of electoral fraud, the network\u2019s primary targets soon included the two companies that provided electronic voting equipment for the election \u2013 Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic.\n\nOn the political battleground, there were rarely tangible consequences for running baseless stories. But Fox had wandered into a legal minefield. And it was not tiptoeing.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyer, Sidney Powell, alleged the companies that had administered the voting machines had committed \u201cthe most massive and [\u2026] egregious fraud the world has ever seen\u201d. Lou Dobbs was perhaps the most outspoken of the Fox News presenters, calling it \u201can electoral 9/11\u201d and a \u201ccyber Pearl Harbour\u201d.\n\nDominion sent 3,600 communications to Fox News denying the various accusations to no effect. Then it mounted a defamation legal action. The case went on for several months, and on the day the trial was about to begin, Fox settled. The result was a massive defamation payout: US$787.5 million (A$1.2 billion).\n\nBut it was not only the expense, it was the embarrassment. As part of the discovery process and the depositions required, Dominion gained access to thousands of internal Fox News documents, demonstrating the stark contrast between what the network\u2019s personalities said in private and what went to air.\n\nMurdoch, in his deposition, said he never believed any of the claims of computer fraud. The internal communications also showed how deeply he detested Trump. After the January 6 2021 riots at the US Capitol, he wrote in an email that he aimed to make Trump a \u201cnon-person\u201d.\n\nTrump\u2019s response to these revelations was swift and predictable. On his Truth Social platform, he wrote:\n\nIf Rupert Murdoch honestly believes that the Presidential Election of 2020, despite MASSIVE amounts of proof to the contrary, was not Rigged and Stollen [sic], then he and his group of MAGA [Make America Great Again] Hating Globalist RINOS [Republican in name only] should get out of the News Business as soon as possible, because they are aiding and abetting the DESTRUCTION OF AMERICA with FAKE NEWS.\n\nJT//STAR MAX/IPx/AP\n\nTrump\u2019s resurrection and Murdoch\u2019s isolation\n\nThe schism between Trump and Murdoch was deep and bitter. Fox\u2019s subsequent search for an alternative to Trump was most publicly visible in late 2022 and early 2023. In the 2022 US midterm elections, the Democrats did much better than expected, and Trump-endorsed candidates performed poorly. The shining exception for Republicans was the governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis.\n\nMurdoch embraced him. Always subtle, a New York Post front page anointed him \u201cDeFuture\u201d and later had a caricature of Trump as Humpty Dumpty, headlined \u201cTrumpty Dumpty\u201d.\n\nDeSantis was a determined cultural warrior, and no doubt Murdoch and others hoped he could represent \u201cTrumpism\u201d without the legal and personal baggage.\n\nHowever, DeSantis proved to be Trumpism without a hint of charisma. Nor did DeSantis dare question Trump\u2019s narrative of victimhood, endorsing his claims of a stolen election and that the legal cases against him were political witch hunts.\n\nBy late 2023, it was clear DeSantis was going to lose the Republican primaries to be the 2024 presidential nominee \u2013 and that Trump was going to win again. All business logic pointed towards the need for Fox News to make amends with Trump. And for Trump, political logic pointed towards the need for a d\u00e9tente with the biggest and most influential conservative media organisation.\n\nThe rapprochement began in January 2024. Fox staged a town hall event for Trump, the first time he had been live on the network for two years. It not only gave Trump a platform, but it was timed to overshadow the other Republican presidential candidates having a debate on CNN.\n\nDeSantis was angry, saying Trump has \u201cgot a Praetorian Guard of the conservative media, Fox News, the websites, all this stuff\u201d.\n\nAs a final act of obeisance, Murdoch attended the Republican National Convention. But it merely underlined his new marginality. Trump, himself, was polite: \u201cI speak with Rupert Murdoch a lot. [\u2026] He\u2019s 100% sharp, he\u2019s sharp as a tack.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump Jr, now the self-proclaimed MAGA enforcer, was less polite. He claimed he had been blacklisted by Fox News, which Fox denied. Then he said:\n\nthere was a time where if your wanted to survive in the Republican Party you had to bend the knee to [Murdoch] or to others. [\u2026] I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case any more.\n\nTo annoy Murdoch further, one of the stars of the convention was Tucker Carlson, who was fired by Fox 15 months earlier. Carlson sat in Trump\u2019s VIP box next to the ex-president, while Murdoch was some distance away in a separate box.\n\nMoreover, Murdoch seemed to have zero influence over Trump\u2019s vice presidential choice, and perhaps was even counterproductive. There were reports he had lobbied against the selection of JD Vance, while Donald Trump Jr and Carlson were both extremely proactive in pushing Vance.\n\nCarlson reportedly advised Trump: \u201cWhen your enemies are pushing a running mate at you\u201d, referring to the Murdoch empire, \u201cit\u2019s a pretty good sign you should ignore them.\u201d\n\nWhat damage has been done?\n\nAll of this serves to underline Trump\u2019s continued dominance. To advance in the Republican Party, it is necessary to pay homage to Trump and his fictions. Ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, The Washington Post looked at nearly 700 Republican candidates for federal office and found that at least a third embraced Trump\u2019s false election fraud claims.\n\nNot only is the party subjected to his worldview, but there is a new group of influential, pro-Trump, mega-donor billionaires, whose influence may be increasing, and whose views could, at best, be called eccentric.\n\nElon Musk, for example, seemed to promise he would give a pro-Trump political action committee US$45 million (A$68 million) a month, but in true Trumpian fashion, later seemed to backtrack. Musk also believes \u201cthe woke mind virus\u201d is \u201cone of the greatest threats to modern civilisation.\u201d\n\nAnother tech billionaire, Peter Thiel, Vance\u2019s principal backer, has said, \u201cI no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.\u201d\n\nIndeed, he thinks \u201cthe 1920s were the last decade in American history during which one could be genuinely optimistic. Since 1920, the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to women \u2013 two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians \u2013 have rendered the notion of \u2018capitalist democracy\u2019 into an oxymoron.\u201d\n\nThis Republican Party is a very different beast from the one over which Murdoch exercised so much influence in recent decades. Indeed, Peter Wehner, who worked for three Republican presidents, says the party today under Trump is pretty much the opposite of its former self.\n\nMurdoch has never given much hint of being someone who harbours regrets. But America\u2019s political landscape today is one he would abhor: the legitimacy of the electoral system is under assault, conspiracy theories have more potency than in decades past, and the Republican Party is dominated by someone he detests and considers a danger to democracy.\n\nDoes he ever acknowledge how his own actions gave momentum to forces that now run against and threaten his own values? He might plead commercial necessity, but surely he knows the disservices to American democracy his media have done.",

        "text": "Joe Biden explains why he dropped out of White House race\nIn the CBS interview, Mr Biden returned to the moment he decided to run against Trump \u2013 when a gathering of far-right activists in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017 turned deadly. He accused Trump of emboldening racists and the far-right.\n\n\u201cEvery other time the Ku Klux Klan has been involved they wore hoods so they're not identified,\u201d he said. \u201cUnder his presidency, they came out of those woods with no hoods, knowing they had an ally.\u201d\n\nHe also repeated his concerns about what might happen after November\u2019s election, saying he was \u201cnot confident at all\u201d that there will be a peaceful transfer of power if Ms Harris defeats Trump.\n\nHe went on to say that he was concerned that there would be violence if Trump loses the election.\n\n\"He means what he says,\u201d Mr Biden said. \u201cWe don't take him seriously. He means it. All the stuff about, 'If we lose, it'll be a bloodbath\u2019.\u201d\n\n\"He's a genuine danger to American security,\u201d Mr Biden said.\n\nTrump commented at a rally in March that it would \u201cbe a bloodbath for the country\u201d if he loses, however his campaign has repeatedly said he was referring to the economy and the auto industry and that Democrats have taken the quote out of context.\n\nAt the same time, the former president has repeatedly insisted, without evidence, that he was cheated out of victory in 2020 and has warned that there will be attempts to \u201crig\u201d the vote this year. He has pledged to pardon some or all of the people convicted for rioting at the US Capitol in January 2021.\n\nMr Biden said he would be campaigning on behalf of Ms Harris and that he had spoken to Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro about touring the state. Mr Biden was born in the working-class city of Scranton, about 120 miles (190km) north-west of New York City.\n\n\u201cI'm going to be campaigning in other states as well. And I'm going to do whatever Kamala thinks I can do to help most,\u201d he said.",

        "text": "Joe Biden reveals reason why he pulled out of race for the White House\nUS President Joe Biden has revealed he dropped out of the race for the White House because Democrats felt his candidacy was \"going to hurt\" their chances of being re-elected.\n\nThe 81-year-old abandoned his campaign in July after months of speculation about his age and his fitness to serve another four years.\n\nConcerns increased among Democrats after a disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump in June and a series of high-profile gaffes.\n\nSenior Democrats, including former US President Barack Obama, expressed their concerns about him running, while former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Mr Biden's long-time friend and ally, urged him to step aside.\n\nAsked on the US news show CBS Sunday Morning why he chose to abandon his campaign, Mr Biden said: \"Look, the polls we had showed that it was a neck and neck race which would have been down to the wire. But what happened was, a number of my Democratic colleagues in the House and Senate thought that I was gonna hurt them in the races.\n\n\"And I was concerned if I stayed in the race, that would be the topic [journalists] would be interviewing me about - 'Why did Nancy Pelosi say [this]? Why did someone [say this]?'\n\n\"And and I thought it would be a real distraction.\"\n\nImage: Joe Biden addresses the nation from the Oval Office about his decision to withdraw from the race. Pic: Reuters\n\nMr Biden added he thought of himself as a \"transition president\" when he ran in 2020, and added: \"I can't even say how old I am. It's hard for me to get out of my mouth.\"\n\nThe US president also said the \"critical issue\" for him is \"maintaining this democracy\".\n\nHe continued: \"Although It's a great honour being president, I think I have an obligation to the country to do the most important thing you can do and that is - we must, we must, we must defeat Trump.\"\n\nIn the interview with CBS' chief election and campaign correspondent Robert Costa, Mr Biden also said he was \"not confident at all\" that there would be a peaceful transfer of power if Mr Trump loses the election.\n\nIt comes after Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol building on 6 January 2021 as they sought to keep him in power two months after his election defeat to Mr Biden.\n\nRead more:\n\nNew vulnerability on display at Trump news conference\n\nWhy Harris picked Tim Walz over 'ambitious' Josh Shapiro\n\nWho is JD Vance?

        "text": "Domestic Issues Overshadow Foreign Conflicts in 2024 Voting Decisions\nRepublicans are focused on inflation and immigration ahead of the November election, while Democrats emphasize abortion policies and democracy.\n\nThe 2024 US presidential election is shaping up to be a race like no other in American political history. According to the 2024 Chicago Council Survey (CCS), fielded June 21\u2013July 1, 2024, most Americans are paying close attention to the electoral contest and intend to vote in November. The data show economics, immigration, and democracy are the most salient issues to American voters. When it comes down to the integrity of the election, many think foreign interference, political violence, and weakening democracy are critical threats.\n\nKey Findings\n\nSeven in 10 Americans (68%) say they are somewhat (35%) or very (33%) closely following news about the election.\n\nMore than half of Americans say issues like democracy (59%), the economy (58%), and inflation (53%) will be important in their voting decisions in November.\n\nThe wars between Russia and Ukraine (50% great deal + fair amount) and Israel and Gaza (47%) play a lesser role in electoral decisions than other domestic issues like immigration (73%), crime (70%), and abortion (64%).\n\nMajorities of Republicans say the economy (76%), inflation (75%), and immigration (69%) will play the greatest role in their voting decisions, while Democrats say democracy (69%) and abortion (63%) will most affect their votes.\n\nPrior to the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, roughly half of Americans considered the possibility of political violence (49%) or foreign interference (54%) related to the 2024 presidential election a critical threat.\n\nMany Watching Election Developments Closely\n\nThe assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, withdrawal of President Joe Biden from the race, and his subsequent endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee have reshaped the race late in the campaign cycle.\n\nData from the 2024 Chicago Council Survey, which was conducted after the first presidential debate, but before President Biden dropped out of the race, show that seven in 10 Americans (68%) say they are very (33%) or somewhat closely (35%) following news about the election.\n\nAcross partisan affiliations, Republicans (76%) and Democrats (74%) are more likely than Independents (56%) to say they are following the race very or somewhat closely (identical percentages of Republicans and Democrats are following very closely). Gallup surveys show that in May, Democrats were following the presidential election more closely than previous races, while Republicans were paying about as close attention to the election as they did in 2000, when George W. Bush and Al Gore competed for the presidency.\n\nAmericans are more likely to report following news about the presidential election than news about any other domestic or foreign policy issue asked about in this survey. However, news about the economy (29% very closely) is a close second, with immigration (21%) attracting very close attention from two in 10 Americans.\n\nEconomy, Inflation, and US Democracy Core Issues for Voters\n\nThe news stories that matter most to constituencies generally land as top voting factors for them. When asked how much of a role various domestic and foreign policy issues would play in their electoral decisions, majorities of Americans say protecting US democracy (59%), the economy (58%), and inflation (53%) will impact their voting decisions a great deal. Roughly four in 10 Americans also say immigration (44%), abortion policies (43%), and crime 39%) matter greatly when deciding for whom to vote.\n\nProtecting democracy is not only a high voting priority for Americans, but a major concern. Two-thirds (67%) believe weakening democracy in the United States is a critical threat to the United States (75% Democrats, 62% Republicans, 62% Independents). In a March 2024 AP-NORC survey, just over half of Americans overall said US institutions and political leaders like Congress (54%), Donald Trump (53%), and the Republican Party (52%) do a poor job of upholding democratic values. Just under half say the same about Joe Biden (48%), the Supreme Court (45%), and the Democratic Party (44%).\n\nWhile large majorities of Americans say inflation, the economy, protecting democracy, crime , and immigration are factors in their voting decisions, there are differences in the extent to which each issue will factor in decisions across partisan affiliations. When it comes to issues that weigh most heavily on their voting decisions, Republicans are most likely to consider the economy (76%), inflation (75%), and immigration (69%). On the other hand, Democrats say that protecting democracy (69%) and abortion policies (63%) will influence their votes.\n\nDespite high-profile coverage of antiwar protests across the United States and recent focus on the war in Ukraine during the NATO summit, 2024 Council data show that foreign conflicts are less influential to voting decisions (among those issues presented). While roughly half of Americans say the Russia-Ukraine war (50%) or the Israel-Gaza war (47%) will play a great deal or fair amount of a role in their presidential vote, no more than two in 10 say it will impact their decisions a great deal (19% Russia-Ukraine war; 17% war in Gaza).\n\nThe voters most likely to turn out to vote (\u201cvery likely\u201d voters) are more keenly focused on these issues than average Americans. For example, they are 12 percentage points more likely to say the issue of democracy will greatly affect their voting decisions (71%, compared to 59% of overall Americans). They are also slightly more likely than the general public to greatly consider abortion, immigration, inflation, and crime when voting. However, when it comes to the influence that the wars in Gaza and Ukraine will have on their voting choices, very likely voters look similar to other Americans (see appendix tables 3-4).\n\nBefore Trump Assassination Attempt, Half of Americans Feared Political Violence and Foreign Interference in Elections\n\nEven before the assassination attempt on former President Trump on July 17, half of Americans (49%) said they were concerned about political violence around the 2024 election. Two thirds of Democrats (65%), nearly half of Independents (47%) and a third of Republicans (33%) consider the possibility of violence around the election a critical threat facing the country.\n\nMade all the more relevant in light of what the Trump campaign characterizes as a hack conducted by Iranian actors, half of Americans (54%) also consider foreign interference in US elections to be a critical threat. Democrats and Independents express greater concern about this possibility than Republicans (see appendix table 1).\n\nThe 2023 Chicago Council Survey also found that 62 percent of Americans consider political polarization in the United States a critical threat, up from half when first asked in 2018. While this is a bipartisan concern, Americans do not seem to hold themselves accountable for this increase in polarized opinion. As Pew research has shown, many Americans express deeply negative views of Americans who affiliate themselves to the other party.\n\nMost Americans Intend to Vote in 2024 Election, but Independents Less Likely\n\nIn 2020, 67 percent of eligible voters voted in the presidential election, marking the highest voter turnout of the 21st century. Today, eight in 10 Americans say they are very (71%) or somewhat likely (11%) to vote in the 2024 presidential election; however, actual turnout is likely to be lower. Across partisan groups, a higher percentage of Republicans say they are very likely to vote (82%), followed by Democrats (76%). Independents\u2014a battleground group for the 2024 candidates\u2014are the least likely to say they are very likely to turnout on Election Day (58%).\n\nConclusion\n\nWith Kamala Harris as the new Democratic nominee, some analysts say that a national debate over issues, rather than the top candidates\u2019 fitness for the presidency, could return to the fore. On Election Day, a candidate\u2019s position on democracy and abortion will have the greatest bearing on the votes of Democrats, who largely believe that the two would be at risk under former President Trump\u2019s conservative administration. On the other hand, Republicans will take a candidate\u2019s proposed economic policies, measures to curb inflation, and stance on immigration into the greatest consideration when voting.",

        "text": "Why is US Election Day on Tuesday\nGeneral or Presidential Elections\n\nThis year, on Tuesday, November 5th, 2024, the next President and Vice President of the United States of America will be elected, as well as 1/3 of the U.S. Senators and all 435 Members of the U.S. House of Representatives will be chosen. Yes, the election will take place on Tuesday.\n\nBut have you ever wondered why the election usually occurs during the week, namely on Tuesday? As always at U.S. Vote Foundation, we've got the answer for you! We're here to help you understand and exercise your voting rights and you can even build your knowledge of U.S. elections at the same time. Read on!\n\nEvery Four Years\n\nEvery four years, the General Election takes place (for a more detailed description of the types of elections, read our blog on types of elections). According to the U.S. Constitution, the U.S. President and Vice President are elected every four years. Furthermore, the U.S. Constitution states that all 435 U.S. House of Representatives members have a term of 2 years, meaning they have to be elected every two years. As for the U.S. Senator, their terms are longer, namely six years.\n\nThis means that one third of the U.S. Senators are up for an election every two years, or 33-34 Senate seats, depending on the year, are vacant. In short, every four years, we've got a major election that can change the direction of the country, depending on the election results.\n\nA Special Tuesday\n\nUnlike most countries that hold their elections on Sundays, the United States of America has its General Election on a special Tuesday. It is the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. In 2024, the General Election will take place on Tuesday, November 5th, 2024. In 2028, it will be on Tuesday, November 7th, 2028, and in 2032, Election Day will be held on Tuesday, November 2nd, 2032.\n\nOn November 5th, 2024, U.S. citizens will be able to fill 469 seats in the U.S. Congress (1/3 or 34 seats in the U.S. Senate and all 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives) as well as technically elect the electors who elect the new President and Vice President (for more on how U.S. President is elected, read our blog on the Electoral College). But why is the General Election on this particular Tuesday?\n\nAct of the 28th Congress\n\nOn January 23rd, 1845, the U.S. 28th Congress passed a Statue II, Chapter I \"An Act to Establish a Uniform Time for Holding Elections for Electors of President and Vice President in all States of the Union,\" that defined a special Tuesday as Election Day. The Act states,\n\n\"Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the electors of President and Vice President shall be appointed in each State on the Tuesday next after the first Monday in the month of November of the year in which they are to be appointed: Provided, That each State may by law provide for the filling of any vacancy or vacancies which may occur in its college of electors when such college meets to give its electoral vote.\"\n\nThe Act unified the date of the election for all states and fixed it to the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. This Act is still in effect today and explains why the General Election is on Tuesday. But there is more to the story.\n\nSolving an Important Problem\n\nThe 1845 Act of the 28th Congress solved a significant flaw of the previous election system. Before the federal law of 1845 was passed, all states were allowed to hold elections on any day within 34 days before the first Wednesday in December, when the electors of the Electoral College formerly met. In that system, states that held federal elections earlier within 34-day period published their final election results, and therefore influenced the outcome of the election results in the states that held their federal elections later. As a result, the states that had voted earlier swayed the results in the states that had their elections later. Deciding on a uniform day as Election Day has helped to remove the undue influence of states that completed their voting prior to that day.\n\nTuesday was chosen as Election Day for convenience. According to History, agrarian culture explains why Tuesday in November was selected.\n\n\"Tuesday was selected as the first and most convenient day of the week to hold elections. Farm culture also explains why Election Day always falls in November. Spring and early summer elections were thought to interfere with the planting season, and late summer and early fall elections overlapped with the harvest. That left the late fall month of November\u2014after the harvest was complete, but before the arrival of harsh winter weather\u2014as the best choice.\"\n\nIn short, because the majority of Americans were farmers at the time the federal law was passed, Tuesday in November worked best with the planting season. Tuesday gave U.S. citizens enough time (one day each way) to travel to the polling stations and back. As for Sunday, it was impractical because the majority of Americans attended church; and Wednesdays were market days for farmers, which made things impractical. So, Tuesday was chosen. Tuesday also stayed until nowadays.\n\nSo, next time you wonder about the famous second Tuesday after the first Monday in November, you know the whole story. You can impress everyone! Now we have a question for you! Have you registered to vote on Tuesday, November 5th, 2024 yet? If you haven't, what are you waiting for?!\n\nWhat Options to Election Day are Available?\n\nIf you are an overseas voter and voting from abroad, the good news is, voting is very convenient because you receive your ballot prior to Election Day. If you've requested it, overseas ballots start to be sent out 45 days prior to the election!\n\nCheck Out Our Overseas Voter Tools and Services Now!\n\n\n\nIf you are in the U.S. and voting domestically and finding that Election Day on Tuesday is not so convenient - most states have options! You can potentially vote by absentee ballot, or vote early before Election Day.\n\nCan I Vote Early in My State? See the Early Voting Dates Chart\n\nWhat Are the Ways I Can Vote in My State?

        "text": "\u2018A different level than 2020\u2019: Trump\u2019s plan to steal election is taking shape\nThere wasn\u2019t anything particularly controversial about Georgia\u2019s presidential primary in March this year. Donald Trump won the Republican contest \u2013 picking up a little more than 400,000 more votes than Nikki Haley, who had long dropped out of the race.\n\nNonetheless, two Republicans on the five-person Fulton county election board refused to certify the election.\n\nJulie Adams and Michael Heekin didn\u2019t point to specific irregularities. Instead, they said they needed more information from election administrators, like chain-of-custody documents for ballots. Adams and Heekin were outvoted.\n\nBut it didn\u2019t end there. In May, Adams, who is a part of an election activist network founded by Cleta Mitchell, voted against certifying another Georgia primary election. Again, despite no irregularities, she said she needed more information. With the backing of a group closely aligned with Donald Trump, Adams had also recently sued the Fulton county board, asking a judge to declare that she and other commissioners could choose not to certify the election.\n\nIt was an unusual request \u2013 verification of ballot totals happens in the extensive process that leads up to certification and state laws generally do not permit those responsible for certifying them the discretion to investigate.\n\nIn early August, the Republican-controlled state election board in Georgia adopted a new rule that essentially gave Adams what she wanted. It requires local election board members to conduct an undefined \u201creasonable inquiry\u201d into any discrepancies before they can certify the election. There are concerns that officials could use that discretion to hold up certification of the election.\n\nThe episode in Fulton county, and the new rule in Georgia, could be an alarming dress rehearsal for how Donald Trump and his allies will try to challenge the election results in November if he loses.\n\nTrump has repeatedly refused to commit to accepting the election results, declining multiple times to do so during a 27 June debate. He has suggested that Christians would \u201cnever have to vote again\u201d if he wins. The anti-democratic sentiment has been echoed by other prominent conservatives, including Mike Howell, the director of the oversight project at the Heritage Foundation, who said earlier this year there was a \u201c0% chance of a free and fair election\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m formally accusing the Biden administration of creating the conditions that most reasonable policymakers and officials cannot in good conscience certify an election,\u201d he said at a Heritage Foundation event this summer.\n\nThe effort poses a challenge that again would test the strength of the US\u2019s voting system and its democratic institutions. It could probably stretch from little-known county election officials to the Congress.\n\nIn some ways, Trump\u2019s attempt to challenge the election result in 2024 could look a lot like his effort in 2020. It has begun months before election day with the seeding of doubt about the integrity of the election and could continue after.\n\nThere are two key differences.\n\nFirst, Trump may be better prepared. Mitchell, a close Trump ally, has spent the last few years building up a network of activists focused on local boards of elections. And the Republican National Committee\u2019s election litigation team is now being led by Christina Bobb, an election denier who is now facing criminal charges for her efforts to overturn the 2020 race. The RNC claims it is recruiting an army of 100,000 poll observers who could provide significant disruption during voting and counting.\n\n\u201cI think we saw efforts by Republicans in 2020 that were pretty ham-handed,\u201d said Marc Elias, a top Democratic voting rights lawyer. \u201cI worry that there will be both legal and extralegal efforts by Republicans to keep ballots from being counted.\u201d\n\nBut more significantly, the idea that the 2020 election was stolen has moved from the fringes to being a pillar of the Republican party. A January poll from PRRI found that 66% of Republicans believe the 2020 election was stolen. \u201cThe most important thing we have to do is protect the vote. You have to keep your eyes open because these people want to cheat and they do cheat, and, frankly, it\u2019s the only thing they do well,\u201d Trump said in a prerecorded video that played all four nights during the Republican national convention in July.\n\nThe belief in stolen elections, Elias said, was \u201cno longer the provenance of crazy people like Rudy Giuliani, Jenna Ellis and Sidney Powell. This is no longer the province of people who thought that there were bamboo filaments in paper or mythical sea creatures involved in the election with Venezuelan dictators.\n\n\u201cIt has become now the standard position of the Republican party.\u201d\n\nSeeds of doubt in 2020 to bloom in 2024\n\nTrump began seeding doubt in 2020 by pointing to mail-in voting as evidence the election was being stolen months beforehand. Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, many states were quickly changing the rules around voting by mail, allowing expanded access because it was not clear if it would be safe to vote in person on election day.\n\nThis year, Americans are unlikely to use mail-in voting at the same levels they did during the pandemic, and Republicans are now encouraging their supporters to take advantage of it. But Trump and allies are using a new messaging tactic in its place: that there are scores of non-citizens and other ineligible people on the voter rolls.\n\nThey\u2019re hanging the hooks to later hang their hat on Sean Morales-Doyle of the Brennan Center\n\nMitchell has played a key role in leading a coalition of groups that has pushed the false idea that there is a serious threat of non-citizens voting in US elections. Her coalition has supported federal legislation championed by the House speaker, Mike Johnson, and others to require proof of citizenship when registering to vote. Such a restriction would probably do little to prevent fraud, which is exceedingly rare. Instead, it would probably make it harder for millions of eligible voters to cast a ballot. Nearly one in 10 eligible voters \u2013 21 million Americans \u2013 lack easy access to proof of citizenship documents, according to one study released earlier this year.\n\nEven though Johnson\u2019s congressional bill passed the House, it will probably go nowhere in the Senate. But it helps create an impression that something is amiss with American elections. To make matters worse, when Kamala Harris replaced Joe Biden at the top of the ticket, Republicans also immediately sought to suggest her candidacy was illegitimate, calling the effort a \u201ccoup\u201d.\n\nA constellation of groups \u2013 including the RNC, the Public Interest Legal Foundation and United Sovereign Americans \u2013 has also filed several lawsuits in various states to create the false impression that voter rolls are not properly being cleaned in several swing states. These lawsuits use misleading methodology and legal claims to suggest that there are a suspiciously large number of people registered in certain jurisdictions. Among other issues, they compare up-to-date voter registration information and outdated data from the American Community Survey.\n\nView image in fullscreen Composite: Rita Liu/The Guardian/Getty Images\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re hanging the hooks to later hang their hat on,\u201d said Sean Morales-Doyle, the top voting rights expert at the Brennan Center.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all part of creating sort of a pretext to say, \u2018Oh, we need to throw out this set of ballots\u2019 or \u2018We can\u2019t really know who the real winner is,\u2019\u201d said Ben Berwick, a lawyer at the non-profit Protect Democracy who works on voting rights issues. \u201cI think much of it won\u2019t stick, but I think the point is to have enough of it stick to create enough uncertainty for that critical post-election period.\u201d\n\n\u2018Tricky legal questions and room for shenanigans\u2019\n\nAny effort to challenge the election results will probably start at the local level.\n\nJust as there was in 2020, there\u2019s likely to be a period of uncertainty after election day when votes are still being counted in key swing states. Two of those, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, still do not allow election officials to begin to process mail-in ballots until election day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely concerned that you\u2019re gonna have a lot of efforts to disturb the process of counting those votes, if we go into the late evening, early hours of the next day and all of that,\u201d said Richard Pildes, a professor at New York University who specializes in election law.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In 2020, chaotic confrontations at polling sites offered misleading evidence that Trump and allies used in their effort to try to overturn the election. Trump\u2019s effort to challenge the election results in Arizona, for example, was undergirded by affidavits from observers and poll watchers who falsely claimed they saw ballots being rejected because of the type of pen voters were using.\n\nIn Georgia, Trump pointed to reports from observers in Atlanta falsely claiming they were removed from the facility where mail-in ballots were counted. In Michigan, Trump\u2019s team used as evidence an \u201cincident report\u201d from an election observer who falsely said she heard workers giving instructions to count a rejected ballot.\n\nAccusations of fraud may find a receptive audience at county boards responsible for certifying elections. Until 2020, no one gave much thought to these positions, sometimes filled by elected officials and other times by little-known party loyalists. In 2020, Trump\u2019s campaign made a strong effort to try to delay certification at the local and state level as part of his effort to overturn the election.\n\nIn Wayne county, home of Detroit, Trump personally called two Republican canvassers on the board responsible for certifying the vote there. The two officials briefly refused to certify, then reversed themselves and did. At the state level, Aaron Van Langevelde, a Republican on the state board of canvassers, faced pressure not to certify the vote, but decided to anyway.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Republicans nearly got the state supreme court to block certification of the state\u2019s election. In Arizona, Trump called the then governor, Doug Ducey, as he was certifying the vote amid a pressure campaign to stop the certification of votes there.\n\nSince 2020, there have been at least 20 instances in eight states of election officials refusing to certify election results.\n\nThe first red flag came in 2022, when county commissioners in Otero county, New Mexico, refused to certify the results of a primary election, citing vague concerns about voting equipment. The secretary of state eventually went to court to force the commissioners to certify the election.\n\nIn July of this year, two Republicans on the county commission in Washoe county, Nevada \u2013 a key county in a battleground state \u2013 refused to certify its primary vote, setting off alarms. The commissioners who refused to certify eventually reversed themselves. Nevada\u2019s secretary of state, Cisco Aguilar, has since asked the state supreme court to clarify that county commissioners have an obligation to certify votes.\n\nThere\u2019s damage done even where certification is eventually forced Ben Berwick of Protect Democracy\n\nSometimes election officials who refuse to certify have pointed to mistakes that happened during the election, even though they did not affect the outcome. In other cases, like Adams\u2019s in Georgia, officials have refused to certify to protest about what they view as unfair laws.\n\nWhile courts would probably force recalcitrant officials to certify the vote, significant damage could still be caused.\n\n\u201cYou can force certification through legal mechanisms, [but] those events tend to be like rocket fuel for conspiracy theories and misinformation and undermining confidence in the election. So there\u2019s damage done even where certification is eventually forced,\u201d said Berwick, the Protect Democracy lawyer.\n\nThe timeline for certifying the vote is important because, under federal law, states must have an official election result by 11 December, six days before the electoral college meets. Delaying certification efforts at the local level could put states at risk of missing that deadline.\n\n\u201cIf we get past that deadline, it opens up a lot of questions, like tricky legal questions and room for shenanigans,\u201d Berwick said.\n\nPildes, the NYU professor, said that while he was concerned about efforts to block certification at the local level, he was confident that state courts could resolve any disputes by the time the electors meet.\n\nA new law, the Electoral Count Reform Act, should provide a significant new layer of protection against election subversion. The bipartisan bill passed Congress at the end of 2022.\n\nThe law makes it so that Trump and his allies cannot repeat what they did in 2020 and submit false slates of electors from key swing states. Significantly, it says that the slate of electors submitted by a state\u2019s executive is the legitimate slate and raises the threshold in both houses of Congress to object to the electoral result.\n\nWhile the law controls what Congress must do once it receives certificates from electors, it doesn\u2019t have much to say about what must happen in the lead-up to the electoral college vote. That could leave a lot of wriggle room for Trump and allies to try to slow down certification and go to court to try to force states to miss their certification deadline.\n\nPrepared for challenges\n\nAfter Donald Trump nearly succeeded in overturning the 2020 election, is the US better prepared to stop a similar effort in 2024?\n\nLawyers and other activists say they are ready, having spent the last four years studying and understanding the vulnerabilities that Trump and allies targeted in 2020. Any effort to block certification is likely to be swiftly challenged in courts, where Trump has already been unsuccessful dozens of times.\n\nThe new Electoral Count Reform Act should offer additional safeguards should there be an effort such as there was in 2020 to get Congress to stop its certification of the vote\n\nYet it would be a mistake to dismiss the threat altogether. The same pressure points that existed in 2020 exist in 2024, and in some places election deniers have been elevated to positions of power.\n\n\u201cThis has started earlier in the cycle and is louder and is more consistent,\u201d said Morales-Doyle of the Brennan Center. \u201cThat is all just at a different level than it was before 2020.\u201d",

        "text": "The Impact of the U.S. Presidential Election on US-Iran Relations \u2014 American Iranian Council\nAs the 2024 U.S. presidential election looms just a few short months away, many Americans\u2019 minds are focused on the race between former president Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. The contest carries tremendous implications for foreign policy. While the candidates\u2019 approaches to conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza may be two of the most discussed foreign policy matters at stake, future US-Iran relations also heavily depend on the outcome of this election. Below, I will map out the possibilities for each candidate\u2019s Iran policy should either be elected. While we cannot predict the future, the unusual circumstances of an incumbent vice president and former president competing for the White House allows for greater insight into future policies based in part on previous actions. This article will compare the Iran policies of the Trump and Biden-Harris administrations and will evaluate their likely impacts on Iran policy in a potential future term.\n\nPrevious Campaign Rhetoric\n\nBefore President Biden exited the race, in the sole presidential debate thus far, the candidates sparred for roughly 90 minutes on a wide range of issues. Of 17,652 words spoken during the debate, less than two hundred related to Iran, with an approximately even split between the candidates. Both Trump and Biden left the stage without giving any promise or indication of what a second term of their Iran policy would be like. Rather, they spent most of their time touting their \u201cstrength\u201d on Iran and criticizing the other as weak. As expected, Trump championed his \u2018maximum pressure\u2019 policy, arguing \u201cIran was broke with me\u2026 They had no money for Hamas. They had no money for anything. No money for terror.\u201d Later, he continued: \u201c\u2026the whole world is blowing up under [Biden].\u201d This furthers previous attempts by the Trump campaign to claim that the October 7th attack would not have happened under his leadership, and that Biden\u2019s relaxing of sanctions directly contributed to it. This fits with Trump\u2019s overall argument that Biden is responsible for violence in Afghanistan, Ukraine, Gaza, and elsewhere. Weeks later at the Republican National Convention, Trump continued these lines of rhetoric - blaming the president for Iran\u2019s alleged newfound economic achievements and status as a nuclear threshold state. Again, notably, Trump did not make any pledges on how he would handle Iran in a second term.\n\nFor Biden\u2019s part, in the debate against Trump he claimed the Trump administration\u2019s assassination of Qassem Soleimani resulted in retaliation by Iran with the largest ever ballistic missile attack on U.S. forces abroad, which caused traumatic brain injuries to 110 service members, and that Trump \u201c[did] nothing about it.\u201d Biden also criticized Trump for referring to the soldiers\u2019 injuries as mere \u201cheadaches.\u201d To assert his own strength on the matter, Biden notedthat he was \u201c\u2026the guy that organized the world against Iran when they had a full-blown\u2026 missile attack on Israel,\u201d referring to Iran\u2019s April 2024 launching of over 300 missiles and drones on Israel in response to Israel\u2019s attack on its consulate in Damascus.\n\nNow that Kamala Harris has taken Biden\u2019s place atop the Democratic ticket, many expect her to continue to align with Biden on many foreign policy issues that she held throughout her term as vice president. However, as of the writing of this article, neither Trump nor Harris have issued a clear roadmap of how they would handle Iran moving forward. Most notably, neither has signaled support for a potential revival of the JCPOA or taken any stance on the future of Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nIndeed the days of the JCPOA may be long over. While both Biden and Trump \u2013 before each was elected \u2013 claimed that they would replace the JCPOA with a better, longer-lasting deal, neither administration was able to accomplish this task. Iran has since neared the status of a \u201cthreshold state\u201d \u2013 having the capacity to build a nuclear weapon without actively attempting to make one. Reports by the IAEA and other partner nations indicate Iran has roughly 833kg of uranium enriched between 20 and 60 percent \u2013 enough to create three nuclear devices if it was further enriched to the weapons-grade benchmark of 90%. In March 2023, then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Mark Milley concluded Iran would need 10-15 days to enrich enough uranium to produce a nuclear weapon, and a few more months to assemble it. After four years of President Trump\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d strategy and nearly the same time of President Biden\u2019s so-called \u201clow boil\u201d strategy, the United States is in no stronger of a negotiating position than it has been since the fall of the JCPOA.\n\nWhichever candidate is elected, the next administration will be dealing with an interesting state of affairs in Iran. After the unexpected death of then-Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash in May 2024, new elections were held in Iran with reform candidate Masoud Pezeshkian winning. As a result, Iran now has its first reformist government since the JCPOA was inked nearly ten years ago, presenting a unique opportunity for rapprochement should the next U.S. President accept the challenge.\n\nPresident Trump and \u201cMaximum Pressure\u201d\n\nDuring his initial run for the White House in 2016, Trump campaigned on exiting the JCPOA, describing it as a \u201cdisaster\u201d and \u201cthe worst deal ever.\u201d After taking office, Trump was then required by the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act (INARA) to certify or not certify Iran\u2019s compliance with the terms of the deal every 90 days. While he certified Iran\u2019s compliance in April and July of 2017, he ultimately declined to do so in October. This decision aligned with a series of personnel changes in his administration, from the likes of the deal-supporting Rex Tillerson to the more hawkish John Bolton and Mike Pompeo. Then, in May 2018, Trump officially announced the U.S.\u2019s withdrawal from the JCPOA.\n\nAt the outset of Trump\u2019s term, Iran had been complying with the highly restrictive terms of the JCPOA for several years. It had limited its uranium enrichment levels to well below weapons grade, cut its centrifuges by two-thirds, and reduced its stockpile of enriched uranium. Even after the American pullout from the deal, it still abided by its terms until over one year after the U.S. withdrawal. At that point, Iran still maintained that it would resume compliance if the United States and other parties to the agreement returned to their commitments of sanctions reduction. By the end of 2020, Iran had increased its enrichment to 20% purity, up from the 3.67% permitted by the deal.\n\nTo pressure Iran back to the negotiating table, the Trump administration commenced its so-called \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d strategy. Maximum pressure was designed to levy enough sanctions on Iran that it would then feel such an economic burden that it would have no choice but to negotiate. Maximum pressure was also intended to limit the Islamic Republic\u2019s available funds to use for sponsoring terrorism or bolstering its nuclear program. Trump levied over 1,500 sanctions on Iran, going beyond those set by the Obama administration to target wide-ranging areas of Iran\u2019s political and economic spheres. The sanctions impacted everything from senior administration and banking officials to military and IRGC members to key aspects of Iran\u2019s economy. It restricted Iran\u2019s oil exports to less than 400,000 barrels per day\u2013 down from over 2.1 million barrels exported while the JCPOA was in effect. Iran immediately felt the impacts of \u2018maximum pressure.\u2019 The year following was described as the \u201ctoughest\u201d in the Islamic Republic\u2019s history. In the two years following the American pullout, the Iranian rial dropped in value by 600%. Oil exports \u2013 which account for up to 70% of Iran\u2019s government revenue - dropped to a historic low, costing Iran roughly $200 billion in oil revenues. Its gross reserves fell from $70 billion in 2017 to $4 billion in 2020.\n\nDespite this pressure, however, Iran refused to concede to American demands and responded by developing an \u201ceconomy of resistance\u201d \u2013 diversifying its economy to rely less on oil revenues and becoming more able to skirt oil exporting restrictions through a \u201cshadow fleet\u201d of unmarked tankers. \u2018Maximum pressure\u2019 also drew high levels of scrutiny from international rights watchdogs due to its impact on Iranian civilians. Human Rights Watch wrote that the campaign \u201c[posed] a serious threat to Iranians\u2019 right to health and access to essential medicines,\u201d including epilepsy and chemotherapy medications. This report cited the U.S.\u2019s restrictions on Iran\u2019s banking system creating high barriers to purchasing critical supplies needed for Iran\u2019s healthcare and other industries.\n\nTrump and Iran\u2019s Military\n\nUS-Iran relations, especially in the past two decades, have been defined either by political/economic matters or around Iran\u2019s military capability and growing capacity to build a nuclear bomb. In the military/nuclear arena, much of the US\u2019 focus relates to its alliance with and defense of Israel. For its part, in Iran, a core part of the country\u2019s foreign policy over the past few decades has been to build a so-called \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d against Israel. And, while Iran has largely conducted its countering of Israeli influence through a series of military proxies (Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, the Houthi rebels in Yemen, and a series of militias in Iraq and Syria), more recently in April 2024, Iran initiated a stunning attack of more than 300 missiles and drones on Israel directly, in response to Israel\u2019s attack on its consulate in Damascus.\n\nGiven the United States\u2019 ardent support for Israel, recent flare-ups in the Middle East have heightened the need for US Presidential candidates to promote their military toughness towards Iran as evidenced by some of their statements in the June 27 presidential debate. While both Trump and Biden (and now Harris) may all make similar \u201ctough\u201d postures while campaigning, it is important to recall that the Trump and Biden-Harris administrations actually had significantly different policies.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s Iran policy notably culminated eighteen days before he left office, with the U.S. assassination of Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani. Soleimani was head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps\u2019 Quds Force, a key figure in Iranian foreign policy, and chief architect of the Axis of the Resistance. He has been cited as the \u201cmost important person in Iran after Ayatollah Khamenei.\u201d\n\nThe strike on Soleimani, however, was simply the peak of a tense eight month period following the fall of the JCPOA. It was also a demonstration of Trump\u2019s willingness to use force to achieve his ends. Before taking this military action, his \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign had involved significant diplomatic and economic measures beyond those of prior administrations. For example, in April 2019, the Trump administration designated the IRGC as a foreign terrorist organization \u2013 the first time the U.S. had placed such a label on a foreign government entity. In the following months, the U.S. deployed increasingly more forces to the Middle East to deter Iranian aggression \u2013 including troops, a Patriot missile battery, and a carrier strike group. As Trump continued to increase sanctions on Iran, Iran responded by breaking more bounds of the JCPOA, and by increasing attacks on U.S. troops in Iraq and other areas.\n\nThe exact rationale for the January 2nd strike on Soleimani has been disputed and debated. Some sources say that Pentagon officials offered Trump the option of doing so as a contrast to make other options seem more reasonable in comparison. The day following the strike, President Trump spoke, offering allegations that Soleimani was planning attacks on American military positions and diplomats abroad. Trump officials also compared Soleimani\u2019s killing to that of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi three months prior. Regardless of the reason, assassinating Soleimani was a further demonstration of Trump\u2019s strongman policy in attempting to bend Iran\u2019s will towards U.S. interests. In response, Ayatollah Khamenei pledged \u201cforceful revenge,\u201d and did so on January 7th by launching a barrage of missiles causing brain injuries to 110 servicemembers. Thirteen days later, under lightning-high tensions, President Biden took office and sought to change course on Iran.\n\nThe Biden-Harris Iran Policy: Attempts at a New Deal\n\nBefore the Biden-Harris administration took office, Biden campaigned on making an \u201cunshakable commitment\u201d to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. His plan for achieving this, however, was misguided. Despite 150 members of Congress signing on to a letter to the President urging him to rejoin the JCPOA without any preconditions, Biden instead opted to place the impetus on Iran to rejoin the deal, saying he would consider sanctions removal if and only if Iran immediately returned to full compliance of the agreement as it was pre-withdrawal. Experts noted that Biden likely viewed Trump\u2019s four years of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d as leverage he did not want to give up by acquiescing to Iranian demands for sanctions removal. This strategy was problematic. American credibility has declined since the signing of the JCPOA. A hasty and catastrophic withdrawal from Afghanistan, failure to honor the nuclear deal, wavering commitments to Ukraine, and other incidents have made other countries skeptical of the United States\u2019 ability to hold a diplomatic commitment through multiple, often disputing administrations. As members of Congress noted, \u201cAmericans have seen first-hand how withdrawing from multilateral agreements and abandoning our allies jeopardizes our national security goals.\u201d With the volatility of American domestic politics, Iran in particular was skeptical of Biden\u2019s offer and declined. U.S. diplomatic inconsistency reinforced Iran\u2019s already anti-west sentiments and view that the United States was not to be trusted.\n\nAlso at the beginning of the Biden-Harris administration, a group of over 50 foreign policy and national security experts penned a similar letter, highlighting the fact that Biden did not need congressional approval to rejoin the JCPOA. He could rejoin via executive order, just as he did to rejoin the Paris climate agreement that President Trump had also exited. Instead of placing the impetus on Iran, President Biden could have taken the burden on himself to rebuild the trust that his country had broken. Any such move, however, even before the war in Gaza and Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, would have come at a significant political cost for Biden so early in his presidency. Instead, he opted for the politically safer option that resulted in no new deal.\n\nThree months into Biden\u2019s term in April 2021, negotiations began in earnest for a successor to the JCPOA. In these discussions, Biden sought increased concessions from Tehran, including a curbing of Iran\u2019s cruise missile program and a reduction of Iran\u2019s presence in the region \u2013 two core aspects of Iran\u2019s foreign policy. A week into negotiations, Israel attempted to sabotage them by bombing Natanz, a major Iranian nuclear site. This set back Tehran\u2019s nuclear capacity and undercut its leverage in the negotiations. In response, Ayatollah Khamenei increased uranium enrichment up to 60% purity, far above the 3-5% needed for civilian purposes that Iran alleges their program is for, and extremely close to weapons-grade.\n\nThe United States and Iran were at an impasse. President Biden demanded Iran first return to compliance before potential sanctions removal. Iran demanded the United States remove sanctions before they would dismantle any of their nuclear program. Then, in June of 2021, President Rouhani and Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif \u2013 both individuals whose support was instrumental in accomplishing the original deal \u2013 left office, leading to over a year of stagnated talks before both parties abandoned them in July 2022.\n\nThe Biden-Harris Post-Deal Strategy \u2013 \u201cLow Boil\u201d\n\nAfter this initial attempt at reconciliation, the Biden-Harris Iran strategy can be best described, as an anonymous official familiar with the matter put it, \u201clow boil.\u201d The administration has sought neither to antagonize nor concede, responding to Iran\u2019s actions proportionally. Their primary goal was simple: use minimal coercion to keep Iran in check, scoring marginal wins when possible, and keeping relations from spiraling out of control. Not long after the failed renegotiations, Biden spoke out in favor of the widespread protests that erupted after the death of Mahsa Amini in September 2022. His first major action regarding Iran followed a year later when Washington and Tehran inked a blockbuster deal to free five American hostages wrongfully detained by the regime in exchange for unfreezing $6 Bn in Iranian oil revenue being held in South Korean bank accounts. This deal was part of a key aspect of Biden-Harris foreign policy \u2013 bringing home Americans held wrongfully abroad. They have freed 35 such hostages to date.\n\nThe hostage exchange deal came under heavy scrutiny, with one Republican calling it a \u201cransom.\u201d GOP Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AK) called the deal a \u201ccraven act of appeasement,\u201d alleging that Iran would then use the \u201cill-gotten gains\u201d to fund terrorism and attack U.S. troops. The newly released funds were restricted to only humanitarian purposes, but Republican detractors countered with allegations that additional humanitarian funding would then, in turn, free up other funds to be used for malicious purposes. This scrutiny intensified after the October 7th Hamas attack on Israel, with House majority leader and then-Speaker candidate Steve Scalise writing via X/Twitter: \u201cThe Biden Administration must be held accountable for its appeasement of these Hamas terrorists, including handing over billions of dollars to them and their Iranian backers.\u201d Shortly after, the Biden-Harris administration announced they and Qatar, where the funds are held, would block Iran\u2019s access for the foreseeable future. In response, Iran criticized the re-freezing, claiming in a statement: \u201cThe money rightfully belongs to the people of Iran\u2026 [for] all essential and non-sanctioned requisites for the Iranians.\u201d\n\nThe Biden-Harris \u201clow boil\u201d strategy has carried over into the wide-ranging proxy war between the U.S., Israel, and U.S.-backed militias against Iran and its Axis of Resistance. In February 2023, in response to three American soldiers being killed by IRGC-backed groups in Jordan, Biden ordered a strike on 85 targets in Iraq and Syria. The targets largely comprised intelligence centers, logistics facilities, and other locations supporting the IRGC and the Axis of Resistance. After Iran famously fired over 300 drones, rockets, and missiles toward Israel in April 2023, Biden\u2019s administration stepped up in Israel\u2019s defense, but strongly discouraged Israel from retaliating, stopping any further escalation from an already near-boiling point.\n\nWhere Does Harris Stand?\n\nEver since Harris rose into the national political spotlight during her 2020 presidential run, she has largely mirrored Biden\u2019s stances on Iran. Many expect her to continue these leanings if she is elected in November. During her initial run for president, she called Trump\u2019s exiting of the deal \u201creckless\u201d and pledged to rejoin the agreement, conditional on Iran\u2019s return to compliance. She has also shared Biden\u2019s desire not to escalate matters, criticizing Trump in January 2020 via X/Twitter, claiming that his assassination of Soleimani \u201cput more American lives at risk.\u201d Most recently as Vice President, she mirrored Biden\u2019s stern message to Iran in response to its missile attack on Israel. Harris has only notably diverged from Biden in one key area regarding Iran: Israel. Harris has been slightly more critical of Israel in its war against Hamas, which could signal a potentially less strict stance against Iran.\n\nOpportunities for the Next Administration\n\nSince the Iranian revolution in 1979, there have been limited opportunities for rapprochement between the US and Iran. In what sometimes has seemed like tragic comedy, both countries have historically alternated in their desire to negotiate with the other. These alternations in desire have rarely coincided. Iranian President Mohamed Khatami (1997-2005) and U.S. President Bill Clinton achieved the most significant thawing in relations since the revolution, with Clinton penning a letter to Tehran and Khatami calling Clinton \u201ccourageous\u201d for his efforts. However, shortly after, the Bush administration named Iran as part of its \u201cAxis of Evil,\u201d citing its sponsorship of terrorism and pursuit of nuclear weapons. Little progress was made between the two nations until the Barack Obama and Hassan Rouhani administrations negotiated the JCPOA from 2012-15. There are two things in common between these two d\u00e9tentes. First, a moderate was in Iranian presidential office who was willing to enter talks. The second is that the U.S. president was a Democrat in his second term. In recent history, Democratic presidents have been much more amenable to striking deals with Tehran, and even more so in their second terms.\n\nIf Kamala Harris wins in November, a third such opportunity will take place. Throughout Biden\u2019s tenure and after JCPOA renegotiations broke down in 2022, he has consistently chosen the least politically costly option to keep Iran-US relations on \u201clow boil.\u201d However, if reelected, Biden\u2019s successor in Harris would be in a uniquely strong position to pursue a d\u00e9tente \u2013 potentially achieving a new JCPOA, which Biden and Harris initially campaigned on in 2020. Of course, negotiations with Iran often come with domestic political fallout, and any sort of concessions made must be done at a not insignificant expense of political capital. As a lame-duck president, Biden would have had to worry much less about the potential political fallout of his actions. While Harris is not in as formidable a position given her ability to run for a second term, she would still be inhabiting an interesting middle-ground of having represented the previous Biden-Harris administration as VP, and also beginning her own first term as President.\n\nMost importantly for the next administration, as described above, Iran has recently elected a moderate president. Masoud Pezeshkian campaigned on better relations with the West, including pledging to renegotiate a nuclear deal to alleviate the sanctions\u2019 burden on Iran\u2019s economy. Pezeshkian also notably allied with former foreign minister Javad Zarif, one of the key players behind the initial inking of the JCPOA in 2015. Together in a foreign policy roundtable, Pezeshkian and Zarif argued that re-engagement with Western institutions is a must for improving Iran\u2019s restricted financial status. Pezeshkian\u2019s somewhat unexpected victory is a sign that Iran has, at least, some appetite for such change, and a goal of improving conditions, which have been worsened by Western sanctions.\n\nUnfortunately for US-Iran relations, many factors currently cloud this possibility for rapprochement. The United States continues to clash with Iran-backed Houthi rebels over attacks in the Red Sea, which U.S. Navy officials have said Iran is \u201cvery directly involved\u201d in. Iran recently sent a massive barrage of missiles directly at Israel, the United States\u2019 chief ally in the region. The war in Ukraine (where Iran\u2019s military support for Russia in its war on Ukraine is at a \u201cnew level\u201d) has also heightened American popular distaste for working with Tehran. Furthermore, the status of the war in Gaza will have a determining impact on US-Iran relations. The two powers stand opposite each other in the conflict \u2013 however, both parties are actively working towards a ceasefire. US-Iran tensions have certainly been strained by the war. However, collaboration on a ceasefire deal could pave the way for further small steps towards better relations.\n\nConclusion\n\nIran now has a window of opportunity in which it may seek rapprochement with the United States. However, in our view, this option requires a victory by Harris in the 2024 elections - something which Iran does not seem to expect. Prior to Iran\u2019s presidential election, the six approved candidates \u2013 Pezeshkian and five hardliners \u2013 debated over who would best counter a second Trump presidency. Neither Biden nor Harris were mentioned once in the debates. Candidate and cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi used Trump\u2019s image in his campaign posters, with one reading \u201cThe person who can stand in front of Trump is me.\u201d One foreign policy expert noted that the hardliner candidates believe their strength will best deter Trump, while moderates assert that a hardline position will provoke harsher sanctions and possibly trigger a repeat of the woeful economic conditions that followed Trump\u2019s maximum pressure campaign.\n\nThe potential for a second Trump presidency has already raised concern among many in the Iranian political establishment. Under a second Trump administration, a return to the JCPOA or a similar such deal would be extremely unlikely as Trump made his views on the JCPOA clear when he withdrew from it and made minimal attempts to return. Notably, Trump\u2019s dominating victory in the 2024 Republican presidential primaries aligned with an almost 20% drop in the value of the Iranian rial, suggesting that if Trump were to win, he will continue his maximum pressure campaign. Moreover, Israel may feel emboldened to further engage Iran or its proxies militarily. Indeed, one of the unfortunate outcomes of a four-year \u201clow boil\u201d strategy from the Biden administration, may be that adding a Trump presidency to the mix will lead to a complete boiling over of conflicts in Iran and the broader Middle East.",

        "text": "President Biden speaks on the stakes of the 2024 election, and on his place in history\nIn his first interview since withdrawing from his re-election bid last month, President Biden told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" that he made his decision, in part, so that the Democratic Party could fully concentrate on what he believes is an urgent task at hand: preventing former President Donald Trump from regaining the White House.\n\nSpeaking with CBS News chief election & campaign correspondent Robert Costa, Mr. Biden said that he made his historic decision at his family home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, in late July, just weeks after his debate with Trump, which caused concern in some Democratic circles.\n\n\"The polls we had showed that it was a neck-and-neck race, would have been down to the wire,\" Mr. Biden said. \"But what happened was, a number of my Democratic colleagues in the House and Senate thought that I was gonna hurt them in the races. And I was concerned if I stayed in the race, that would be the topic. You'd be interviewing me about 'Why did Nancy Pelosi say\u2026' 'Why did so-and-so\u2026' And I thought it'd be a real distraction, number one.\n\n\"Number two, when I ran the first time, I thought of myself as being a transition President. I can't even say how old I am; it's hard for me to get it outta my mouth. But things got moving so quickly, it didn't happen.\"\n\nAdded to that combination, he said, was \"the critical issue for me still \u2013 it's not a joke \u2013 maintaining this democracy. I thought it was important. Because, although it's a great honor being president, I think I have an obligation to the country to do what [is] the most important thing you can do, and that is, we must, we must, we must defeat Trump.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden. CBS News\n\nPresident Biden announced his decision on Sunday, July 21, and addressed the nation from the Oval Office three days later, saying that he would not let anything, even \"personal ambition,\" get in the way of \"saving our democracy.\"\n\nFollowing his speech, he was joined by members of his family. Asked what he told them after his historic address, Mr. Biden replied, \"It's what they said to me. They said \u2013 my grandchildren call me Pop, my children call me Dad. And they said they were proud, and it mattered to me a lot.\"\n\nCosta then asked about the president's late son, Beau Biden, who died in 2015. \"When I saw you with your family in the Oval, I wondered, is he thinking of Beau, too?\"\n\nMr. Biden paused. \"Look, I can honestly say that I think of him all the time. Whenever I have a decision that's really hard to make, I literally ask myself, 'What would Beau do?' He should be sitting here being interviewed, not me. He was really a fine man. You know, Beau was committed to my staying committed. We had a conversation toward the end when he was \u2026 we, everybody, we knew he wasn't going to live. And he said, 'Dad, I know, we know what's gonna happen. I'm gonna be okay, Dad. I'm all right. I'm not afraid. But Dad, you gotta make me a promise.' I said, 'What's that, Beau?' He said, 'I know when it happens, you're gonna want to quit. You're not gonna stay engaged \u2026. Look at me. Look at me, Dad. Give me your word as a Biden. When I go, you'll stay engaged. Give me your word. Give me your word.' And I did.\n\n\"And that's why \u2013 I had not planned on running after he died, and then Charlottesville happened.\"\n\nOn August 12, 2017, white supremacist demonstrations in Charlottesville, Virginia turned deadly when Heather Heyer, a civil rights activist, was murdered in what the Justice Department called a \"hate-inspired act of domestic terrorism.\"\n\nMr. Biden has long traced his decision to run in 2020 to that moment \u2013 the beginning of his journey to the presidency.\n\nCosta asked, \"As you look at American democracy seven years later, how do you see it?\"\n\n\"When I spoke to the mom who lost her daughter as a consequence of neo-Nazis and right [wing], white supremacists coming out of fields in America with torches, carrying Nazi banners, singing the same, sick antisemitic bile that was sung in Germany in the '30s, and when her daughter was killed, the press went to then-President Trump and said, 'What do you think?' He said, 'There are very fine people on both sides.' I knew then, I knew I had to do something. And that's why I decided to run, because democracy was literally at stake.\"\n\nMr. Biden explained that the Republican nominee's talk underscores his concerns that a second Trump term would undermine democracy.\n\n\"He evidenced everything that we thought,\" Mr. Biden said. \"Now, January 6th, attack on the Capitol, he talks about now, because he now talks about making sure they're all, you know, let out of prison. He's gonna pardon them. Think of this. Every other time the Ku Klux Klan has been involved they wore hoods so they're not identified. Under his presidency, they came out of those woods with no hoods, knowing they had an ally. That's how I read it. They knew they had an ally in the White House. And he stepped up for them.\"\n\nMr. Biden said he is not confident that there would be a peaceful transfer of power should Trump [who refused to acknowledge his election loss in 2020] lose in November to Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n\"If Trump wins ... I mean, if Trump loses, I'm not confident at all,\" Mr. Biden said. \"He means what he says. We don't take him seriously. He means it. All the stuff about, 'If we lose, it'll be a bloodbath \u2026' Look what they're trying to do now in the local election districts where people count the votes. They're putting people in place in states that they're gonna 'count the votes,' right?\"\n\nRepeating his familiar maxim about politics in a democracy, President Biden said, \"You can't love your country only when you win.\"\n\nTrump has said his remarks on Charlottesville were not intended to praise white nationalists, and that he was warning of economic carnage when he said \"bloodbath.\"\n\nBut Trump isn't the only thing on Mr. Biden's mind, with five months left in his presidency.\n\nAsked if he believes a ceasefire is possible in Israel's war with Hamas before he leaves office, Mr. Biden replied, \"Yes. It's still possible. The plan I put together, endorsed by the G7, endorsed by the U.N. Security Council, et cetera, is still viable. And I'm working literally every single day \u2013 and my whole team \u2013 to see to it that it doesn't escalate into a regional war. But it easily can.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden with CBS News' Robert Costa. CBS News\n\nWhen Mr. Biden entered office in early 2021, he had an ambitious agenda. Costa said, \"Some Senators told me, in March of 2021, you took them into the Oval Office and pointed up at FDR's portrait and said, 'We're going big. We're going in that direction.'\"\n\n\"I did,\" Mr. Biden said. \"And we have, with the great help of so many people. Look, democracy works. And it was very important to prove that it worked, prove that it worked. I mean, look at what we've been able to do: We created 16 million jobs, I mean, real new jobs. We've gotten around a brink of having the private sector invest over a trillion dollars \u2013 a trillion dollars \u2013 in the American economy. One of the things I fought for as a Senator for a long time was to change the dynamic of how we grow the economy, not from the top down, but from the bottom up. The idea of trickle-down economics doesn't work, in my view.\"\n\nAsked if he would project that pride in his administration's record by going on the campaign trail with Harris, Mr. Biden said yes. \"I talk to her frequently, and by the way, I've known her running mate is a great guy. As we say, if we grew up in the same neighborhood, we'd have been friends. He's my kind of guy. He's real, he's smart. I've known him for several decades. I think it's a hell of a team.\"\n\n\"To those who have expressed skepticism about how much you'll be on the trail, or about the rest of your term, raised questions about your health, what do you say to them?\" asked Costa.\n\n\"All I can say is, 'Watch.' That's all,\" Mr. Biden replied. \"Look, I had a really, really bad day in that debate because I was sick. But I have no serious problem.\n\n\"I was talking to Governor Shapiro, who's a friend. We have got to win Pennsylvania, my original home state. He and I are putting together a campaign tour in Pennsylvania. I'm going to be campaigning in other states as well. And I'm going to do whatever Kamala thinks I can do to help most.\"\n\nMr. Biden talked with \"CBS Sunday Morning\" in the president's private residence, in the White House Treaty Room, where historic peace agreements have been signed, beneath a portrait of Ulysses S. Grant, the general-turned-president who labored to restore the Union after the Civil War.\n\nAsked how he wishes history to remember him, President Biden replied, \"That he proved democracy can work. It got us out of a pandemic. It produced the single greatest economic recovery in American history. We're the most powerful economy in the world. We have more to do. And it demonstrated that we can pull the nation together.\n\n\"Look, I've always believed, and I still do, the American people are good and decent, honorable people,\" he said. \"When I announced my candidacy to run way back for President, I said, 'We've got to do three things: Restore the soul of America; build the economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down; and bring the country together.' No one thought we could get done \u2013 including some of my own people \u2013 what we got done.\n\n\"One of the problems is, I knew all the things we did were going to take a little time to work their way through,\" he continued. \"So now, people are realizing, 'Oh, that highway, oh, that \u2026' The biggest mistake we made, we didn't put up signs saying, 'Joe did it'!\"\n\nFour years ago, what \"Joe\" did was defeat Donald Trump. Now, with Trump attempting to return to the White House, the president is sounding the alarm in a way sitting presidents rarely, if ever, do.\n\n\"The stakes are that high to you?\" asked Costa.\n\n\"I give you my word, I think they're that high,\" Mr. Biden said. \"Mark my words: If he wins this nomination, I mean, excuse me, this election, watch what happens. It's a danger. He's a genuine danger to American security.\n\n\"Look, we're at an inflection point in world history, we really are,\" the president said. \"The decisions we make in the last three, four years, and the next three or four years are going to determine what the next six decades look like. And democracy is the key. And that's why I went down and made that speech in Johnson Center about the Supreme Court. Supreme Court is so out of whack, so out of whack. And so, I proposed that we limit terms to 18 years.\n\n\"There's little regard by the MAGA Republicans for the political institutions,\" he said. \"That's what holds this country together. That's what democracy's about. That's who we are as a nation.\"\n\n\n\nStory produced by Ed Forgotson. Editor: Carol A.

        "text": "Impact of US elections on water industry\nBluefield Research has released a report examining what the outcome of the US presidential elections would mean for the country's water industry.\n\nWhy the race to the White House matters\n\nIn the report, Reese Tisdale, president and CEO, Bluefield Research, said that the water industry was at a crucial juncture, and that whoever heads to the White House in November, faced many challenges from ageing infrastructure to climate-related risks.\n\nHe added that the analysis was in \u201cresponse to a flurry of inquiries from Bluefield clients seeking to understand the impact of upcoming elections and potential effects on the policy landscape, infrastructure investments, supply chains, water quality management, and legal ramifications for municipal and industrial water and wastewater operators.\u201d\n\nThe research paper specifically examines what impact each party might have should they win the election, in terms of impact on municipal utility service providers and industrial water and wastewater sectors. Of course, legislation and long-term policy planning will all be affected by the final make-up of the Senate and the House of Representatives, and whether either party exerts control.\n\nA Kamala Harris-led Democratic win\n\nBeing the incumbent party, the Democrats are likely to continue with many of their existent policies. The authors of the report suggest 'incremental change'. Whether the withdrawal of President Biden from the election race, with Vice-President Kamala Harris now the party's candidate, will result in a change of policy or funding is unclear.\n\nUnder President Biden's administration, \u20ac57.7 billion from the Infrastructure Investment & Jobs Act (IIJA) was directed to clean and drinking water initiatives, including tackling Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), State Revolving Funds (SRFs), the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA), Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation (WIIN) Act, and more.\n\nThe IIJA allocates roughly \u20ac6.8 billion for Water Infrastructure for the Nation, Water Recycling and Desalination, Water Storage and Conveyance, and WaterSMART Grants. The report suggests that the IIJA is likely to survive regardless of which party wins the election, as both are committed to infrastructure projects.\n\nOther acts that impact on water and wastewater management include the Inflation Reduction Act (hydrogen, water for metal mining), the US Chips and Science Act (semiconductor fabrication water and wastewater treatment requirements), and more.\n\nThe report speculates that future policy might include further PFAS enforcement and effluent guidelines. An election win for Kamala Harris would also see the lead service line replacement continuing to fruition.\n\nA Donald Trump-led Republican administration\n\nThe report's authors suggest things might take a different path should Donald Trump be elected for a second administration. Specifically, measures linked to tackling climate-related risk are likely to be scaled back, with Republicans and Democrats often on opposing sides when it comes to climate action.\n\nThe report suggests that a Trump administration would 'scale back select measures through administrative avenues and judicial challenges', thanks to an 'ineffectual Congress'.\n\nWith policymaking delegated to an appointed group of agency directors, the report suggests a weakening of the National Environmental Policy Act (EPA) through increased rates of 'permitting', allowing corporations and big business to avoid much of the Act's measures. The EPA is also likely to be subject to budget cuts and deregulation under a Trump administration.\n\nOther policies likely to affect the water industry that could be slowed down or reassessed include the Inflation Reduction Act and some equity-related programs in the SRFs. The report notes that although the Clean and Drinking Water SRF program, which is utilised 'for water infrastructure investments with states, Tribes' is likely to remain a primary source of such funding regardless of administration, the current Republican House majority had at one time proposed cutting SRF appropriations by as much as 60 per cent for the 2024 fiscal year. This would have been the largest cut in the program's history.\n\nPotential future water and wastewater applications in the nascent hydrogen energy industry would also be under threat from a Trump election win. As would the continued rollout of the lead service line replacement program.\n\nWhat next for PFAS legislation?\n\nOne of the biggest topics in the water industry is the ongoing detection and destruction of PFAS 'forever chemicals'. As recently as May (2024), President Biden announced the introduction of the legally enforceable National Drinking Water Standards, as part of the EPA's PFAS Strategic Roadmap, with the aim of reducing 'PFAS exposure for approximately 100 million people, prevent thousands of deaths, and reduce tens of thousands of serious illnesses'.\n\nPolluters must report the release of the two most common PFAS chemicals - perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) \u2013 and the under terms of the CERCLA (Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act) Act, the EPA has a strong tool to force polluters to pay for investigations and clean-up operations.\n\nAccording to the Bluefield Research report, a Trump administration is likely to 'disrupt and delay PFAS regulation through administrative means and litigation roadblocks set forth by chemical manufacturers and affiliated industry groups'.\n\nThe National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)\n\nAnother key differential between parties relates to The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). This federal law dates to 1970 and requires federal agencies to assess the environmental impacts, such as water availability, quality etc, of any proposed action before final decisions are made.\n\nFor example, whenever federal activities such as airports, buildings, military complexes, highways, parkland purchases are planned, environmental impacts assessments, including potential alternative options, must be conducted to inform the decision-making process.\n\nDuring his first term as president, Donald Trump had made changes to the Act. However, these were reversed in 2022 by President Biden. It is fair to presume, as the research paper suggests, that a new Trump administration would seek to 'roll back' on NEPA requirements such as those focused on 'climate and social justice'. The research paper's authors conclude that this could lead to increase pollution, health risks and the destruction of rivers and streams.\n\nTo read the full report, visit: https://www.bluefieldresearch.com/",

        "text": "Election Day is in 85 days, but voters in some key states can cast ballots next month\nElection Day is now 85 days away, but some voters could cast their ballot even sooner.\n\nThat is less than two months of runway for Vice President Kamala Harris, who became the nominee for the Democratic party after President Joe Biden announced he would not seek a second term. She is now the party's official nominee, thanks to a virtual roll call held by the DNC on Aug. 5 to satisfy ballot deadlines in several states.\n\nRepublican nominee Donald Trump, on the other hand, announced he would seek reelection in November 2022, approximately two years ahead of Election Day.\n\nThe political landscape has shifted dramatically since Harris took over the Democratic ticket. Her campaign raised $126 million in the first three days after receiving the torch from Biden, and has since surpassed $300 million. Her rallies have seen crowd sizes topping 10,000 people. In the meantime, Trump has pivoted his focus from Biden to Harris, but recent polling shows he has fallen behind Harris in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, three key swing states.\n\nPennsylvania, a key battleground state for this election, could accept ballots in some counties less than a week after the Sept. 10 debate hosted by ABC News, which Trump and Harris have both agreed to attend.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nHere are the other states with early-voting periods coming up soon, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures:\n\nGetting to the polls:10 states made it trickier to apply for an absentee ballot.

        "text": "Trump campaign says it has been hacked\nTrump campaign says it was hit by hackers\n\nTrump campaign says it was hit by hackers\n\nTrump campaign says it was hit by hackers\n\nFormer President Donald Trump's presidential campaign said Saturday that it has been hacked and suggested Iranian actors were involved in stealing and distributing sensitive internal documents.\n\nThe campaign provided no specific evidence of Iran's involvement, but the claim comes a day after Microsoft issued a report detailing foreign agents' attempts to interfere in the U.S. campaign in 2024.\n\nIn its report, Microsoft cited an instance of an Iranian military intelligence unit in June sending \"a spear-phishing email to a high-ranking official of a presidential campaign from a compromised email account of a former senior advisor.\"\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung blamed the hack on \"foreign sources hostile to the United States.\"\n\nOn Monday, the FBI said it is investigating the matter.\n\nThree sources familiar with the investigation told CBS News on Monday the FBI is investigating attempted phishing attempts directed at people associated with both the Trump campaign and the Biden-Harris campaign. The attempts go back to early summer and are believed to be the work of Iran, though work on that continues. The Washington Post was first to report that the Democratic presidential campaign was targeted as well.\n\nA National Security Council spokesperson told CBS News that it was deferring to the Justice Department on the matter.\n\n\"As we have said many times, the Biden-Harris Administration strongly condemns any foreign government or entity who attempts to interfere in our electoral process or seeks to undermine confidence in our democratic institutions,\" the NSC spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nMicrosoft declined comment when reached by CBS News Saturday.\n\nPolitico first reported Saturday on the Trump hack. The outlet reported that it began receiving emails on July 22 from an anonymous account. The source \u2014 an AOL email account identified only as \"Robert\" \u2014 passed along what appeared to be a research dossier the campaign had apparently done on the Republican vice presidential nominee, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio. The document was dated Feb. 23, almost five months before Trump selected Vance as his running mate.\n\n\"These documents were obtained illegally\" and \"intended to interfere with the 2024 election and sow chaos throughout our Democratic process,\" Cheung said.\n\nHe pointed to the Microsoft report issued Friday and its conclusions that \"Iranian hackers broke into the account of a 'high ranking official' on the U.S. presidential campaign in June 2024, which coincides with the close timing of President Trump's selection of a vice presidential nominee.\"\n\n\"The Iranians know that President Trump will stop their reign of terror just like he did in his first four years in the White House,\" Cheung said, adding a warning that \"any media or news outlet reprinting documents or internal communications are doing the bidding of America's enemies and doing exactly what they want.\"\n\nIn response to Microsoft's report, Iran's United Nations mission denied it had plans to interfere or launch cyberattacks in the U.S. presidential election. In July, U.S. officials with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, FBI and Department of Homeland Security indicated that Iran has started an influence campaign designed to undercut Trump's candidacy.\n\nCheung did not immediately respond to questions about the campaign's interactions with Microsoft on the matter.\n\nIn that report, Microsoft stated that \"foreign malign influence concerning the 2024 US election started off slowly but has steadily picked up pace over the last six months due initially to Russian operations, but more recently from Iranian activity.\"\n\nThe analysis continued: \"Iranian cyber-enabled influence operations have been a consistent feature of at least the last three U.S. election cycles. Iran's operations have been notable and distinguishable from Russian campaigns for appearing later in the election season and employing cyberattacks more geared toward election conduct than swaying voters.\"\n\n\"Recent activity suggests the Iranian regime \u2014 along with the Kremlin \u2014 may be equally engaged in election 2024,\" Microsoft concluded.\n\nSpecifically, the report detailed that in June 2024, an Iranian military intelligence unit, Mint Sandstorm, sent a phishing email to an American presidential campaign via the compromised account of a former adviser.\n\n\"The phishing email contained a fake forward with a hyperlink that directs traffic through an actor-controlled domain before redirecting to the listed domain,\" the report states.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris' campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the reported hacking or on the Democratic nominee's cybersecurity protocols.\n\nand contributed to this report.",

        "text": "The Real Numbers: Tracking Crowd Sizes at Presidential Rallies \u2013 Ash Center\nOver the past week, the size of the crowds at rallies featuring the U.S president or candidates for that office has once again become a subject of intense scrutiny and debate. Lots of factors can affect crowd size \u2014 venue location, venue capacity, and weather, to name a few \u2014 and the relationship between the size of a candidate\u2019s rally crowds and the probability that they\u2019ll win the election is certainly not linear.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s clear from the intensity of the discussion around the topic that it does carry some political weight, and the Crowd Counting Consortium (CCC) has been collecting data on the size of crowds at these events (among many others) for more than seven years. So, now seems like a good time to summarize and report again on what we\u2019ve captured.\n\nSo far in 2024, CCC has logged 37 political rallies at which former president Donald Trump appeared, and we have information on crowd size for 28 of them. Across those 28 rallies and using our standard estimation rules (see below), the average crowd size has been about 5,600. That\u2019s similar to averages of 4,600 in 2023 (19 events with information on crowd size) and 5,200 in 2022 (21 events) but still down from the average of nearly 15,000 across eight events in 2021, including the rally on the National Mall on January 6. It\u2019s also similar to the average of about 5,000 we saw in the last presidential election year, 2020, when we logged a whopping 83 rallies featuring then-President Trump, but still down from averages of 8,100 across 10 events in 2017; 7,400 across 44 events in 2018; and 11,000 across 19 events with crowd-size info in 2019.\n\nBefore he dropped out of the race in late July, President Biden had appeared at seven rallies in 2024, according to our data, and we had information on crowd size for only four of them. Across those four, the average crowd size was about 1,300, and the largest reported crowd size we saw was \u201cthousands.\u201d Biden only appeared at two rallies in 2023, and we don\u2019t have information on crowd size for either one. He featured in 13 rallies in 2022, and the average crowd size at the six on which we have information about that was about 2,400. In 2021, we saw an average size of about 1,600 across three events with crowd info. In 2020, at the start of the COVID pandemic, Biden only made a handful of appearances before crowds that we deliberately kept to very small numbers; we recorded seven rallies featuring Joe Biden that year, only have information about crowd size for three of them, and saw an average size of 65 across those three.\n\nSince late July, when she became the presumptive and then official Democratic Party nominee for president, Vice President Harris has appeared at six campaign rallies. The reported crowd sizes at those rallies have ranged from about 10,000 to about 15,000, and we calculate an average size across the six of about 13,400.\n\nNow, some notes on the methodology.\n\nThe Crowd Counting Consortium \u2014 a collaboration between the University of Connecticut and the Nonviolent Action Lab at Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation \u2014 is a public-interest project that\u2019s been making structured data on U.S. protest activity (including political rallies) since January 2017. The data are made freely available through our GitHub repository, and the data-making process, including the sources we use, is described in detail in our coding guidelines.\n\nAs that document describes, to estimate crowd size, we record any estimates we see in the sources we track, mostly commercial news outlets and social media; convert ambiguous numeric words or phrases to numbers using a conservative rule that assumes the lowest possible value (e.g., \u201chundreds\u201d becomes 200, \u201ctens of thousands\u201d becomes 20,000); and then split the difference between the lowest and highest recorded estimate. So, for example, if a we saw reports that \u201cthousands\u201d, \u201ctens of thousands\u201d, and \u201cabout 30,000\u201d attended a Trump or Biden rally, we would convert those words to 2,000 and 20,000, respectively, and then average the lowest and highest of all the resulting values \u2014 here, 2,000 and 30,000 \u2014 to arrive at a conservative point estimate of 16,000.\n\nFinally, on this particular topic, it\u2019s crucial to note that we do not regard Donald Trump as a credible reporter of the crowd sizes at his own rallies and therefore do not include his assertions about those numbers in our estimation process. Mr. Trump regularly and often grossly exaggerates the size of the crowds at events he headlines, so we restict our view in those cases to estimates from the news media, law enforcement, and other reporters and observers. By contrast, estimates of rally crowd size provided by the Harris campaign so far have lined up with observations made by news outlets and other eyewitnesses, so we do include those in our records when they are reported, as we did with President Biden.\n\nThe R script we used to filter relevant event records from the larger CCC data set and then generate these statistics can be found on the Nonviolent Action Lab\u2019s GitHub repository, here.",

        "text": "August 11, 2024, presidential campaign news\nVice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. Getty Images\n\nPresident Joe Biden had banked on June\u2019s presidential debate turning around a race that was slipping away from him.\n\nNow, Donald Trump may be laying a similar bet after reversing himself by agreeing to debate on ABC next month as his new Democratic opponent enjoys surging momentum.\n\nTrump clearly doesn\u2019t believe he\u2019ll suffer the kind of debacle that ended Biden\u2019s campaign, but his decision \u2014 and call for another two debates on NBC and Fox, which Vice President Kamala Harris has not agreed to \u2014 tells an emerging truth about the election.\n\nAfter a barnstorming week for Harris and her new running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Trump suddenly looks like old news \u2014 a crushing new experience for an ex-president who prides himself on driving the narrative.\n\nA huge test for both candidates: The build-up to the debate on September 10, assuming it goes ahead, will be intense, and the truncated nature of the new campaign means it could create another historic pivot point on the dwindling road to the White House.\n\nAlready, Trump is playing his idiosyncratic expectations game of denigrating the skills of his opponent, who could be the first Black woman and South Asian president. At a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort Thursday, he compared Harris unfavorably with Biden, who he\u2019d long argued lacked the mental acuity to serve. \u201cShe\u2019s actually not as smart as he is. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s very smart either, by the way. I\u2019m not a big fan of his brain,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe clash also looms as an extreme test for Harris. The vice president has a mixed record in debates \u2014 she performed strongly in such events early in her failed 2020 presidential campaign. But at others, she struggled. And her most unflattering moments in office have come when she\u2019s been asked to explain her positions or answer tough questions in major interviews.",

        "text": "Judge rules RFK Jr. not a state resident, can't be on New York ballot\nA judge ruled Monday that independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s name should not appear on New York's ballot, saying that he falsely claimed a New York residence on nominating petitions despite living in California.\n\nKennedy's lawyers quickly vowed to appeal ahead of the Aug. 15 deadline. If the judge's ruling is upheld, it would not only keep Kennedy off the ballot in New York but could also lead to challenges in other states where he used an address in New York City's suburbs to gather signatures.\n\nThe ruling came after a North Carolina judge decided earlier Monday that Kennedy can remain on that state's ballot following a separate challenge on different grounds.\n\nJudge Christina Ryba, in her 34-page decision, said the rented bedroom Kennedy claimed as his home in the state wasn't a \"bona fide and legitimate residence, but merely a 'sham' address that he assumed for the purpose of maintaining his voter registration\" and furthering his political candidacy.\n\n\"Given the size and appearance of the spare bedroom as shown in the photographs admitted into evidence, the Court finds Kennedy's testimony that he may return to that bedroom to reside with his wife, family members, multiple pets, and all of his personal belongings to be highly improbable, if not preposterous,\" the judge wrote.\n\nRyba said evidence submitted in trial showed Kennedy had a \"long-standing pattern\" of borrowing addresses from friends and relatives so he could maintain his voter registration in New York State while actually residing in California.\n\n\"Using a friend's address for political and voting purposes, while barely stepping foot on the premises, does not equate to residency under the Election Law,\" the judge wrote. \"To hold otherwise would establish a dangerous precedent and open the door to the fraud and political mischief that the Election Law residency rules were designed to prevent.\"\n\nClear Choice Action, the Democrat-aligned political action committee that backed the legal challenge, said the ruling makes it clear that Kennedy \"lied about his residency and provided a false address on his filing papers and candidate petitions in New York, intentionally misleading election officials and betraying voters' trust.\"\n\nThe lawsuit, filed on behalf of several voters in the state, claims Kennedy's state nominating petition falsely listed a residence in well-to-do Katonah while actually living in the Los Angeles area since 2014, when he married \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" actor Cheryl Hines.\n\nKennedy, who led a New York-based environmental group for decades and whose namesake father was a New York senator, argued during the trial that he has lifelong ties to New York and intends to move back.\n\nDuring the trial, which ran for less than four days, Kennedy said he currently rents a room in a friend's home in Katonah, about 65 kilometers north of midtown Manhattan, though has only slept in that room once due to his constant campaign travel.\n\nThe 70-year-old candidate testified that his move to California a decade ago was so he could be with his wife, and that he always planned to return to New York.\n\nBarbara Moss, who rents the room to Kennedy, testified that he pays her $500 a month. But she acknowledged there is no written lease and that Kennedy's first payment wasn't made until after the New York Post published a story casting doubt on Kennedy's claim that he lived at that address.\n\nThe judge also heard from a longtime friend of Kennedy's who said the candidate had regularly been an overnight guest at his own Westchester home from 2014 through 2017, but was not a tenant there as Kennedy had claimed.\n\nAttorneys representing several New York voters grilled Kennedy in often heated exchanges as they sought to make their case, pointing to government documents including a federal statement of candidacy with a California address, and even a social media video in which Kennedy talks about training ravens at his Los Angeles home.\n\n\"Kennedy's testimony that none of the furniture, bedding and other decorative items in the spare bedroom belonged to him, as well as his testimony that his wife and family, his extensive book collection, and his wide assortment of domestic and exotic pets all remained in California, was further compelling evidence that Kennedy lacks the necessary physical presence and intent to remain\" at the Katonah address, the judge wrote in her ruling.\n\nKennedy has the potential to do better than any independent presidential candidate in decades thanks to his famous name and a loyal base. Both Democrat and Republican strategists have expressed concerns that he could affect their candidate's chances.\n\nKennedy's campaign has said he has enough signatures to qualify in a majority of states, but his ballot drive has faced challenges and lawsuits in several.\n\nKennedy has told reporters that getting knocked off the ballot in New York could lead to lawsuits in other states where his campaign listed the same address.\n\nAfter the trial ended Thursday, Kennedy argued that people who signed his petitions deserve a chance to vote for him.\n\n\"Those Americans want to see me on the ballot. They want to have a choice,\" he said.",

        "text": "When is election day 2024? Is it a federal holiday?\nPolitics \u2013 particularly presidential politics \u2013 are taking center stage as we move towards the November elections.\n\nThe presidential election is planned for Tuesday, Nov. 5, 2024. Topping the ballot will be presumptive Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris and her VP pick, Minnesota governor Tim Walz. Former President Donald Trump headlines the Republican ticket with running mate JD Vance, a U.S. Senator from Ohio.\n\nREAD MORE: Harris vs. Trump: Who is leading now? Latest numbers show how much race has changed\n\nPresidential Election Day is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Congress first designated that day for national elections in 1845, partly because many people lived far from polling places and it was thought they could travel on Monday to arrive at their destination by the next day. November was a month after the busy harvest season.\n\nAccording to America250.org, before that year, states could hold presidential elections within a 34-day period before the first Wednesday in November, a fluctuation that caused issues as the country grew.\n\nElection Day is not a federal holiday, meaning government offices remain open. Some states, however, do close state offices, including:\n\nDelaware\n\nHawaii\n\nIllinois\n\nIndiana\n\nLouisiana\n\nMaryland\n\nMichigan\n\nMontana\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNew York\n\nRhode Island\n\nVirginia\n\nWest Virginia\n\nThere have been several efforts over the years to make Election Day a federal holiday. Most recently, U.S. Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-California, introduced the Election Day Holiday Act to boost voter turnout.\n\n\u201cNo one should be unable to vote because they have to work or care for a family member,\u201d Rep. Eshoo said. \u201cVoting is the cornerstone of our democracy and Congress must make it easier to vote, not harder. With a presidential election this year, it\u2019s imperative that we reaffirm our commitment to the right to vote and ensure every voice is heard. Our democracy depends on it.\u201d\n\nAccording to a 2022 study, 26% of Americans who didn\u2019t vote reported being too busy to do so because of obligations at work.\n\nThe bill and ones like it have been introduced in Congress several times but have failed to gain sustained traction.",

        "text": "Polling 101: How accurate are election polls?\nBetween the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, the announcement by President Joe Biden that he\u2019ll step aside, the candidacy of Vice President Kamala Harris, and her announcement of running-mate Tim Walz, the 2024 presidential campaign so far has been full of unexpected plot twists.\n\nAnd there\u2019s still 12 weeks to go before the general election.\n\nSo what to make of the myriad election polls offering near-daily updates on which candidate seems to be gaining\u2014or losing\u2014an edge?\n\nWe sought insights from Professor Don Moore, the Lorraine Tyson Mitchell Chair in Leadership and Communication and an expert on overconfidence, and Aditya Kotak, BA 20 (Statistics, CS), a former research apprentice in Moore\u2019s Accuracy Lab. Kotak teamed up with Moore after growing curious about the confidence intervals that are often listed in fine print below polls. They published their analysis in 2020.\n\n\ufeff\n\nFirst off, brief us on your headline finding.\n\nDon Moore: Most polls report a 95% confidence interval. But we found that the actual election outcome only lands inside that interval 60% of the time\u2014and that\u2019s just a week before the election. Further out, the hit rates fall even farther. Polls taken a year before the election stand only a 40% chance of getting the vote share from the actual election inside the poll\u2019s 95% confidence interval.\n\nWhy do polls include a margin of error and a confidence interval, and what do they tell us?\n\nAditya Kotak: Both the margin of error and the confidence interval capture \u201csampling error,\u201d which represents how much the poll\u2019s sample population might differ from the true population of voters. A confidence interval refers to how often the result is expected to fall within the range of the margin of error. It\u2019s important to note, though, that the margin of error only reflects expected imperfections in random sampling, and ignores other sources of error.\n\nYou describe sampling error as a \u201cstatistical error.\u201d What are some of the non-statistical errors that can make a poll less accurate?\n\nMoore: Sometimes there is bias generated by the method by which pollsters reach respondents. If it\u2019s random-digit dialing, for instance, it will only reach people who have phones and who answer them when pollsters call. If those people are different from those who vote, then the poll\u2019s predictions might be biased.\n\nIn your paper, you conclude that in order for polls to be 95% accurate just a week before an election, they should double the margin of error they report. Give an example.\n\nKotak: Let\u2019s say a candidate is polling at 54% a week before the election, with a margin of error of plus-or-minus 3%. The 95% confidence interval implies a 95% chance that the candidate will win 51% to 57% of the vote. Our analysis shows that in reality, you\u2019d have to double that margin of error to plus or minus 6% to get 95% accuracy. That means that the outcome is less certain; the candidate is likely to get anywhere from 48% to 60% of the vote.\n\nDon, as an expert on overconfidence, why do you think the confidence intervals reported by pollsters are so consistently overconfident? Why don\u2019t they increase the margins of error?\n\nMoore: I think poll results are overconfident for many of the same reasons that everyday human judgments are overconfident: We are wrong for reasons that we fail to anticipate. The electorate is changing, and prior elections are imperfect predictors of future elections. When we are wrong about the future and don\u2019t know it, we will make overconfident predictions.\n\nHow can the voting public gauge which polls are more accurate?\n\nMoore: The voting public will have difficulty gauging poll accuracy\u2013pollsters have difficulty gauging poll accuracy! But we can tell you what the voting public should NOT do: Choose to selectively believe the poll results that favor their political preferences. If a poll is inaccurate, it is less likely to be due to intentional bias by pollsters, and more likely due to the inherent uncertainty in polling.\n\nYou looked at polls from the 2008, 2012, and 2016 general elections, as well as primaries in 2008, 2012, and 2016. Did you find any evidence that polls accuracy has grown less accurate over time?\n\nKotak: No, we did not see any statistically significant difference in individual poll accuracy over the various election years. When breaking out our data by year, each election cycle showed the same trend towards 60% accuracy a week before an election, with no significant variation from one year to another.\n\nDo your findings apply to aggregated polls, such as those collected by FiveThirtyEight? Should we be more confident in those averages?\n\nMoore: No, and this is an important point. Poll aggregators like FiveThirtyEight try to adjust for the unreliability in individual polls.\n\nKotak: Often, these aggregators use custom methodology to account for individual polling inaccuracies. Our research suggests that there is indeed a need for such adjustments, but we did not review their methodologies to opine whether they are more or less reliable.\n\nGiven the uncertainty in this year\u2019s election, do you expect the polls to be even less accurate than usual?\n\nMoore: No, we have little reason to expect the problem to be getting worse. Polls have always been flawed. Don\u2019t listen to the vapid \u201chorse race\u201d coverage of candidates\u2019 standing in the polls. Instead, pay attention to the candidates\u2019 stances on the issues and plans for what they will do in office.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nDon Moore: I\u2019m Don Moore. I\u2019m a professor here at the Haas School of Business.\n\nAditya Kotak: I\u2019m Aditya Kotak. I\u2019m a Cal Class of 2020 alum in statistics.\n\nDon: You are gonna see a lot of results from polls\u2014political polls\u2014collected between now and the election in November. We were interested in the accuracy of polling results. And so we did this study back in 2020.\n\nAditya: The question we sought to ask was: How often is the true election result falling within the 90%, 95% confidence interval that these polls usually publish when they include a margin of error. So what we did is we looked through over 6,000 different polls that were published in the past several election cycles and did an analysis to see how many times that the polls\u2019 margin of error actually included the final election outcome.\n\nAnd what we found was that just in the weeks prior to an election, a 95% confidence interval really only captured the true election outcome 60% of the time.\n\nDon: For a poll to be accurate, its 95% confidence interval should include the truth 95% of the time. That confidence interval reflects the uncertainty around the poll\u2019s results that come from sampling just a subset of the larger voting population.\n\nNow, our results suggest that in order to capture the actual election result 95% of the time, a poll taken a week before the election would have to double its margin of error.\n\nSo when you see a poll result that indicates it\u2019s accurate to plus or minus 3 percentage points, which is standard for a poll taken with approximately 800 likely voters, you would need to grow that for a poll taken the week before the election to at least 6 percentage points above or below the forecast result.\n\nAnd the further you go ahead of the election, the wider you\u2019d have to make that confidence interval such that it includes the actual election result 95% of the time.\n\nAditya: So if you\u2019re looking at a polling and asking yourself how confident should you be? Well, as we know a week is an eternity in politics and more often than not, you should stay skeptical when looking at those poll results.",

        "text": "Why do US parties hold presidential conventions? What to know, in 500 words\nConventions are where US political parties officially choose their presidential candidates. But how do they work?\n\nOne by one, states across the United States hold primaries and caucuses in the lead-up to a presidential election, allowing voters to weigh in on their favourite major-party candidates.\n\nBut those state-level votes ultimately culminate in a single event: the party convention.\n\nIt is at those conventions that the Democratic and Republican parties generally confirm their respective nominee for the presidency, based on the outcome of the primaries and caucuses.\n\nLast month, Donald Trump was officially named the Republican nominee at a convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Now, it is the Democrats\u2019 turn, as the party gathers next week in Chicago, Illinois, to hold its convention.\n\nThe meeting concludes on August 22, with Kamala Harris set to take the stage to rally Democrats behind her White House campaign.\n\nSo how do the national conventions work?\n\nElaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, described the conventions as \u201cthe last word\u201d in the presidential nomination process.\n\n\u201cThe legal authority for choosing the nominee of the party is with the convention, not actually with the primary voters.\u201d\n\nEach convention includes a series of procedural votes, including on event rules and the party\u2019s platform, but the main event is undoubtedly the presidential nomination.\n\nThe nomination is confirmed in what\u2019s called a \u201croll call\u201d, where each state announces from the convention floor how many delegates it is awarding the nominees.\n\nDelegates are generally assigned to vote for a candidate according to their state\u2019s primary or caucus results. A certain number of delegates, however, are \u201cunpledged\u201d, which means they can cast their vote however they please.\n\nIf a candidate wins a majority of the delegates, they win the nomination.\n\nIn some election years, including 2024, this process is considered largely ceremonial because the presumptive nominees are known before the conventions are even held.\n\nHarris was confirmed as the Democratic nominee after winning an early virtual roll call. A \u201cceremonial\u201d roll call with still happen at the Chicago convention, though.\n\nTo sum it up another way: The party conventions involve a lot of procedures and ceremony, but they typically mark the last step in the Republican and Democratic parties\u2019 presidential nomination process.\n\nIn effect, the conventions are an opportunity for Republicans and Democrats to unite around their respective picks and build enthusiasm before an election.\n\nPresidential nominees also have historically announced their choice for vice president at the party conventions, adding to the buzz.\n\nParty conventions didn\u2019t always hold such a prominent place in presidential races, though.\n\nUS presidential nominees were once chosen by their respective parties behind closed doors.\n\nThat changed in the 1830s, when both the Republicans and Democrats began holding conventions to decide who would seek the presidency.\n\nThose early conventions were different from the ones we know today: States did not hold primaries or caucuses for many of the first conventions, meaning the nominees were chosen by key members of each party rather than as a result of popular votes.",

We're all set up -- the people are fantastic in Butler, it\u2019s a great area,\" Trump told Musk. \"These are incredible people.\"\n\nHARRIS CAMPAIGN CRITICIZES TRUMP FOR SERVING \u2018SELF-OBSESSED RICH GUYS\u2019 AFTER INTERVIEW WITH ELON MUSK\n\n\"I think I'll probably start by saying, \u2018As I was saying prior to being so horribly interrupted,'\" Trump then joked, previewing how he would pick up where he left off on July 13.\n\nTrump reveals the 'miracle' of his assassination attempt\n\nTrump told Musk that the \"miracle\" of his assassination attempt in Pennsylvania this summer was that he was looking in the \"exact direction\" of shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks when he opened fire.\n\n\"And so it hit me at an angle that was far less destructive than any other angle. So that was the miracle,\" Trump said, recounting the path of the bullet that struck his ear. \"That was -- for those people that don't believe in God, I think we got to all start thinking about that. You have to, you know, I'm a believer, now I'm more of a believer I think.\"\n\n\"It was amazing that I happened to be turned just at that perfect angle,\" Trump added.\n\nTrump says 'we're going to have the largest deportation in the history of this country'\n\nTrump told Musk at one point during the interview that \"We're going to have the largest deportation in the history of this country\" and \"we have no choice.\"\n\nThe remark came as the conversation was focusing on the challenges posed by illegal immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\"We\u2019re already overwhelmed Elon, we are overwhelmed,\" Trump said.\n\nTRUMP CHATS WITH MUSK IN LENGTHY, OVERARCHING INTERVIEW AS HARRIS CONTINUES SNUBBING MEDIA\n\n\"And I saw an ad just before I got on the air... I saw an ad by Kamala saying how she is going to provide border security. Where has she been for three and a half years?\" Trump said.\n\nTrump calls Biden the 'worst president in history'\n\nTrump called Joe Biden \u2013 the current President of the United States \u2013 the \"worst president in history.\"\n\nSpeaking about the events that led to Biden dropping his re-election bid, Trump said Vice President Harris is \"incompetent\" and \"as bad as Biden.\"\n\n\"Look she hasn't done an interview since this whole scam started,\" Trump said. \"And say what you want, this was a coup. This was a coup of a President of the United States. He didn't want to leave. And they said, \u2018we can do it the nice way, or we can do it the hard way.\u2019\"\n\n\"Yeah, I mean they just took him out back behind the shed and basically shot him,\" Musk responded.\n\nTrump cited the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, inflation and the \"Afghanistan mess\" as some of his criticisms of Biden\u2019s administration.\n\nX MELTS DOWN AFTER TRUMP-MUSK'S INTERVIEW \u2018SPACE\u2019 IMMEDIATELY CRASHES\n\n\"Now, Biden is close to vegetable stage, in my opinion,\" Trump added during a later portion of the interview.\n\nTrump says he wants to 'close up' the Department of Education\n\nTrump told Musk that one of his \"first acts\" that he would do in a second presidential term is to \"close up the Department of Education.\"\n\nTrump said he would \"move education back to the states where, states like Iowa, where states like Idaho, you know, not every state will do great because the states that basically aren't doing good now, you look at Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, he, he's terrible. He does a terrible job. So he's not going to do great with education.\n\n\"But of the 50, I would bet that 35 would do great. And 15 of them, or, you know, 20 of them will be as good as Norway. You know, Norway is considered great,\" Trump told Musk.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTrump says as it is right now, the U.S. spends \"more per pupil than any other country in the world\" despite being ranked further down on lists of countries with the best education systems.",

This week, he writes about the impact on polls of Gov. Tim Walz as Kamala Harris's running mate, and looks at the changing swing states' landscape.\n\nNational Results: Slight changes over time; race still close\n\nCurrent polling continues to show the race is close nationally between Trump and Harris, but we are seeing slight changes over time. An NPR/PBS News/Marist College Poll conducted August 1-4 shows that Harris now has a three-point lead over Trump: 51% of respondents said they would support Harris if the election were held today and 48% percent indicated they would support Trump, although that lead is still\n\nAndy Crosby\n\nwithin the poll's margin of error. When third-party candidates are included, 48% of respondents indicated they would support Harris, 45% indicated they would support Trump, and 5% indicated they would support Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (other candidates received 1% or less support). A more recent poll conducted August 2-7 by Ipsos shows a slightly larger lead for Harris: 42% of respondents indicated they would vote for Harris, 37% indicated they would vote for Trump, and 4% indicated they would support Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.\n\nOf course, as we have discussed previously, national polls are interesting, but less useful to predict actual election results, because the United States does not elect presidents using a national vote. This makes certain \"battleground\" states (Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin) especially important.\n\nA deeper dive into the swing states\n\nSpeaking of swing states, a recent New York Times/Siena College poll of swing state voters in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin conducted August 5-8 shows us why campaigns are spending both time and money in these states: The race can be incredibly close, and the picture gets even more complex once third-party candidates are included in polling questions.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, arguably one of the most important battleground states due to its larger number of electoral votes, 49% of respondents indicated they would vote for Harris if the election were held today, compared to 46% for Trump when only the two major-party candidates are included in the polling question. When third-party candidates including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are included in the polling question, the results are slightly closer: 45% Harris, 43% Trump, 5% Kennedy, and 2% Jill Stein (other candidates received 1% or less).\n\nIn Michigan, Trump has a slight lead when respondents are asked to choose between the two major-party candidates: 48% of respondents indicated they would vote for Trump if the election were held today, compared to 46% for Harris. However, the results change when third-party candidates are included: 44% of respondents indicating they would vote for Harris if the election were held today, compared to 43% for Trump, and 5% for Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. (other candidates received 1% or less).\n\nFinally, in Wisconsin, 50% of respondents indicated they would vote for Harris if the election were held today, compared to 46% for Trump. Harris\u2019 lead gets wider in Wisconsin when third-party candidates: 49% Harris, 42% Trump, and 6% Kennedy (other candidates received 1% or less).\n\nLooking forward: Upcoming debate(s), and 'The Walz Effect'\n\nEven though we have already seen changes in the polls in recent weeks, we may still see further movement in the coming weeks. Both the Harris and Trump campaigns have agreed to a debate on Sept. 10 on ABC News, and the campaigns may still agree to additional debates. As we saw with the most recent presidential debate over the summer between President Biden and former President Trump, debates can have a real impact on presidential campaigns.\n\nIn addition, one change in the political landscape in recent weeks is Harris\u2019 selection of Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate. As we discussed above, two critical battleground states are in the Midwest: Michigan and Wisconsin. Walz, from neighboring Minnesota, signals the importance of these states to the Harris campaign, and the campaign no doubt hopes his selection will boost the ticket in Midwestern states.\n\nAt the same time, Gov. Walz is not well-known outside his home state. The NPR/PBS News/Marist College Poll conducted Aug. 1-4 mentioned above shows that 71% of respondents either have never heard of Gov. Walz or were unsure of their opinion of him. I expect to see that proportion change with the upcoming Democratic National Convention on Aug. 19-22 in Chicago that will introduce Walz to voters, and we may (potentially) see a vice-presidential debate at some point in the coming weeks.\n\nStay tuned for what promises to be an extremely interesting few weeks of polling ahead!",

        "text": "'No tax on tips' becomes campaign issue for Trump and Harris\nWhy Trump and Harris both say 'no tax on tips'\n\nGetty Images Bartender Athena Young cleans glasses while speaking to the Review-Journal about the \"no tax on tips\" policy at Atomic Kitchen in Las Vegas, July 31.\n\nIn the hotly divided US presidential campaign, a rare area of agreement has emerged: Workers\u2019 tips should not be taxed. Former president Donald Trump, the Republican candidate, was first out of the gate with the proposal, announcing it at a rally in June. Vice-president Kamala Harris, the Democratic opponent, came out in favour of the plan this weekend, earning her the nickname \u201cCopy Cat Kamala\u201d from the Trump campaign. It is a proposal intended to win attention for the candidates from Americans who work in service industries \u2013 restaurant workers, bartenders, hairdressers, manicurists, taxi drivers and others, who often receive a significant portion of their income in tips.\n\nWhere does this matter and why?\n\nBoth candidates announced their support for the idea in Nevada, a state seen as a toss-up in the election. Restaurants and hotels employ more than 20% of the workforce in the state, which is known for its Las Vegas casinos. Mr Trump said he started to champion the policy after a waitress complained to him about her taxes. Republicans, who have long favoured lower taxes, adopted it as part of their official party platform and several bills are now circulating in Congress, backed by restaurant lobby groups. Some Democrats also have voiced support - including President Joe Biden, whose press secretary said that he backed the idea a day after Ms Harris endorsed the plan. The discussion comes as electronic payments make tips easier to trace, raising the risk of failing to report or under-reporting such income, an historically common problem. For all the buzz that ending taxes on tips has generated, however, it is a relatively niche issue. Nationally, an estimated 4 million workers regularly receive tips \u2013 less than 3% of the overall workforce, according to an analysis by Yale University's Budget Lab. What\u2019s more, a significant share of those workers \u2013 about 37% - earn so little that they do not currently pay income taxes to the federal government at all, the analysis found.\n\nWhat are the current rules?\n\nUnder the current law, employees are required to disclose all tips over $20 per month to their employer. The federal government then collects a share via income and payroll taxes, which fund programmes such as Social Security. (States also have their own rules about income tax.) Americans reported $38bn in tip income to the federal government in fiscal year 2018, the most recent year for which there is data. On average, that amounted to just over $6,000 in income per taxpayer. For some servers, however, tips can account for more than half of their hourly earnings, according to estimates from the National Employment Law Project.\n\nWhat impact would this have?",

        "text": "Suspected Iranian cyber intrusion in U.S. presidential race\nDetails emerged over the weekend of a suspected Iranian cyber intrusion into the campaign of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, potentially resulting in the theft of internal campaign documents.\n\nThe FBI is investigating the matter as well as attempts to infiltrate President Joe Biden\u2019s reelection campaign, which became Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 campaign after Biden dropped out of the race.\n\nHere\u2019s what we know:\n\nWhat happened?\n\nTrump\u2019s presidential campaign said Saturday that it had been hacked and that sensitive internal documents were stolen and distributed. It declared that Iranian actors were to blame.\n\nThe same day, Politico revealed it had received leaked internal Trump campaign documents by email, from a person only identified as \u201cRobert.\u201d The outlet said the documents included vetting materials on Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance and Sen. Marco Rubio, who also was considered as a potential vice president.\n\nTwo other news outlets, The New York Times and The Washington Post, also said they received leaked materials. None of them revealed details about what they had, instead describing the documents in broad terms.\n\nIt\u2019s still unclear whether the materials the news outlets received were related to Trump\u2019s alleged campaign hack. Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung indicated they were connected, saying the documents \u201cwere obtained illegally\u201d and warning that \u201cany media or news outlet reprinting documents or internal communications are doing the bidding of America\u2019s enemies and doing exactly what they want.\u201d\n\nThe FBI on Monday confirmed that it\u2019s investigating the intrusion of the Trump campaign. Two people familiar with the matter said the FBI also is investigating attempts to gain access to the Biden-Harris campaign.\n\nWhy is Trump blaming Iran?\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t provide specific evidence showing Iran was behind the hack. But it pointed to a Microsoft report released Friday that detailed an Iranian attempt to infiltrate a presidential campaign in June.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s report said an Iranian military intelligence unit had sent \u201ca spear-phishing email to a high-ranking official of a presidential campaign from a compromised email account of a former senior advisor.\u201d Spear-phishing is a form of cyberattack in which an attacker poses as a known or trusted sender, often to install malware or gather sensitive information.\n\nThe tech company wouldn\u2019t disclose which campaign or adviser was targeted, but said it had notified them. Since then, both Trump and a longtime friend and adviser of the former president, Roger Stone, have said they were contacted by Microsoft related to suspected cyber intrusions.\n\n\u201cWe were just informed by Microsoft Corporation that one of our many websites was hacked by the Iranian Government \u2013 Never a nice thing to do!\u201d Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Saturday.\n\nGrant Smith, an attorney for Stone, said his client \u201cwas contacted by Microsoft and the FBI regarding this matter and continues to cooperate with these organizations.\u201d He declined further comment.\n\nWhat does the government say?\n\nU.S. State Department officials declined to speculate on allegations that Iran was behind the hack, but a spokesperson said it would be in keeping with Tehran\u2019s past use of cyberattacks and deception.\n\n\u201cThese latest attempts to interfere in U.S. elections are nothing new for the Iranian regime,\u201d spokesperson Vedant Patel said on Monday.\n\nU.S. intelligence officials declined to comment on the incident and referred questions to the FBI, which has said only that it\u2019s investigating.\n\nIran\u2019s mission to the United Nations, when asked about the claim of the Trump campaign, denied being involved.\n\n\u201cWe do not accord any credence to such reports,\u201d the mission told The Associated Press. \u201cThe Iranian government neither possesses nor harbors any intent or motive to interfere in the United States presidential election.\u201d\n\nHowever, Iran long has been suspected of running hacking campaigns targeting its enemies in the Middle East and beyond. Tehran also has threatened to retaliate against Trump over the 2020 drone strike he ordered that killed prominent Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani.\n\nWas Harris targeted too?\n\nHarris\u2019 campaign has declined to say whether it has identified any state-based intrusion attempts, only saying it vigilantly monitors cyber threats and wasn\u2019t aware of any security breaches of its systems.\n\nBut two people familiar with the matter said the Biden-Harris campaign also was targeted in the suspected Iranian cyber intrusion. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the details of the investigation.\n\nAt least three staffers in the Biden-Harris campaign were targeted with phishing emails, but investigators have uncovered no evidence the attempt was successful, one of the people said. The attempts came before Biden dropped out of the race.\n\nThe FBI began investigating that cyber incident in June, and intelligence officials believe Iran was behind the attempts, that person said.",

The BBC has not independently verified the claims.\n\nA Trump campaign spokesman told the BBC the documents were illegally obtained by \"foreign sources hostile to the United States\". In a statement to US media, Iranian officials denied any connection to the hack.\n\nUS news website Politico reported on Saturday that it had been emailed campaign documents including internal research carried out on Trump\u2019s running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s campaign has said some of its internal communications have been hacked and suggested it was targeted by Iranian operatives.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not give any further details or any evidence linking the document leak to Iranian hackers or the Iranian government.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said on Monday that it is investigating the incident.\n\nThe Trump campaign statement came one day after Microsoft released a report indicating that Iranian hackers targeted the campaign of an unnamed US presidential candidate in June.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Threat Analysis Center (MTAC) said that the campaign was sent a spear phishing email \u2013 a message designed to look trustworthy in order to get the target to click on a malicious link.\n\n\u201cOver the past several months, we have seen the emergence of significant influence activity by Iranian actors,\u201d the MTAC report said.\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said the June hacking attempt mentioned in the MTAC report \u201ccoincides with the close timing of President Trump\u2019s selection of a vice presidential nominee\".\n\n\u201cThe Iranians know that President Trump will stop their reign of terror just like he did in his first four years in the White House,\u201d Mr Cheung said.\n\nHe said the hack was \"intended to interfere with the 2024 election\".\n\nA spokesman for Iran\u2019s permanent mission to the United Nations said in a statement to the Washington Post: \u201cWe do not accord any credence to such reports.\n\n\"The Iranian Government neither possesses nor harbors any intent or motive to interfere in the United States presidential election.\"\n\nPolitico said that in late July it began receiving emails from a person who identified themselves only as \u201cRobert\u201d using an AOL email account.\n\nThe news outlet said the Vance file was 271 pages long and based on publicly available information about Vance\u2019s past record and statements. The email account also sent part of a research document about Florida Senator Marco Rubio, who was also a vice presidential contender, it said.\n\nPresidential campaigns routinely research potential vice-presidential nominees in order to ferret out any potentially embarrassing revelations. Politico reported that some of Mr Vance's previous - and well-known - criticisms of Trump were labelled in the document as \"potential vulnerabilities\".\n\nThe Microsoft report noted: \"Iranian cyber-enabled influence operations have been a consistent feature of at least the last three US election cycles.\"\n\nMicrosoft had released a similar report during the 2020 election saying Iranian hackers had targeted presidential campaigns.\n\nUS security sources have also warned of an Iranian plot to assassinate Trump, unconnected to last month\u2019s attempted shooting in Pennsylvania. And on Tuesday, the US justice department charged a Pakistani man alleged to have ties to Iran with plotting to assassinate US officials, potentially including the former president.",

        "text": "The Impact of the Upcoming U.S. Election on Fundraising\nHold onto your hat!\n\n\n\nIn case you didn\u2019t notice, there\u2019s a little event happening, around and about November 5th, that seems to have the world\u2019s attention. Unless you\u2019ve had your head buried in the sand on some tropical island in recent weeks, passions are running high \u2014 very, very high \u2014 during this Presidential Election cycle.\n\n\n\nTo wit: An estimated $449 million was donated to Trump and Harris last month alone. That\u2019s a record by a long shot \u2014 almost half a billion dollars out of the economy and out of your donors pockets. Talk about passion!\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re fretting about the potential impact on your annual giving and/or membership programs you\u2019re not alone. So take a deep breath. Much of what the weeks ahead bring will be out of our control. But there are definitely still concrete steps you can take to ameliorate the impact on your program. Here are a few:\n\n\n\nMake space. Adjust the timing of your fall campaigns if at all possible. In many cases, any communications or appeals landing too close to Election Day will get lost in the noise and can die on the vine. And keep in mind that the outcome likely won\u2019t be decided immediately on election night. For a week or so before and a week \u2014 or even two after \u2014 the world will be holding its breath. And that most certainly includes our special world of donors and potential donors.\n\n\n\nSpread the risk. Every four years is different. There is always impact but the when, and the how much, has varied wildly. We simply won\u2019t know for sure until we can measure and compare what happens this fall to prior giving seasons \u2014 likely not until early 2025. So take practical steps to avoid spending too much on one appeal or campaign. For example, consider splitting your acquisition mailings up into multiple smaller drops spread out over the fall and even into December. You should of course avoid delivering your renewals right into the election, but also consider adding an extra touchpoint in December when the world will (hopefully) have settled back down. The simplest package will do \u2014 the goal is simply to just get another reply form and envelope into the hands of your best donors after the dust has settled \u2014 but before 12/31!\n\n\n\nBe ready with your message(s). Is your organization somewhat political \u2014 a progressive or conservative cause where the outcome of the election will directly affect the way you talk to your donors or members? Then be prepared with two messages reflecting either outcome. Even in cases where the advance polling shows a clear winner there can be a major surprise. (Think 2016!). So don\u2019t be caught flatfooted. Know what you want and need to say to your constituencies either way and have your messaging ready.\n\n\n\nWhether you are celebrating the outcome or horrified, you can bond, connect, and motivate! For the majority of nonprofits \u2014 social services, arts, animal welfare, education, etc. \u2014 who may not be directly impacted by who is in the Oval Office, the goal will be to cut through the noise. If you have a real crisis or an urgent need close to the election and can\u2019t afford to hold back then don\u2019t. Acknowledge that your audience might be distracted and tell your very best and most moving story. Don't forget \u2014 your donors support you for a reason. Throughout this time, make sure to remind them why their dollars matter. Show them their past and recent impact and thank them for all they do.\n\n\n\nLearn the rules. Whether you\u2019re a c3, c4 or PAC, make sure you\u2019re up to date on what you can \u2014 and can\u2019t say \u2014 regarding candidates and politics. And if your organization has a robust paid media program (and hopefully you do!) make sure you study the particular restrictions and safeguards that are being put in place, particularly for social media campaigns. From blackouts \u2026 to pauses on accepting some new promotions \u2026 to new safeguards on the lookout for AI generated content \u2026 know what you can and can\u2019t do this fall. Here one link to some useful information: Meta policies and safeguards for elections\n\n\n\nEvery four years is different of course. But if the last few weeks are any indicator, we are likely to be in for a wild ride. So much is unpredictable and out of our control. But it\u2019s our job to be prepared and to take control when and where we can.\n\n\n\nGood luck, and I\u2019ll see you on the other side!\n\n",

        "text": "Ex-county clerk found guilty of tampering with voting machines\nEx-county clerk found guilty of election interference\n\nPeters pleaded not guilty to all counts in 2022.\n\nPeters has become well known among election deniers who falsely believe the 2020 presidential election was rigged against former President Donald Trump.\n\nA jury found former Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters, a Republican, guilty on seven out of 10 counts in the election interference case.\n\nA former Colorado county election official was found guilty on Monday of tampering with voting machines after the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe case represents the first time a local election official has been prosecuted over a suspected security breach during the 2020 election.\n\n\"Tina Peters willfully compromised her own election equipment trying to prove Trump's Big Lie,\" Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold said in a statement.\n\n\"Today's verdict sends a clear message: we will not tolerate any effort to threaten the security of our gold standard elections,\" she added.\n\nThe jury deliberated for over four hours on Monday before returning the verdict. Four of the seven charges Peters was found guilty on are felonies.\n\nThe former county clerk was convicted of three counts of attempting to influence a public servant, one count of conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation, first-degree official misconduct, violation of duty and failing to comply with the secretary of state.\n\nProsecutors say Peters engaged in \"a deceptive scheme which was designed to influence public servants, breach security protocols, exceed permissible access to voting equipment and set in motion the eventual distribution of confidential information to unauthorized people,\" according to the indictment.\n\nProsecutors said Peters helped breach the county's election computer systems and allowed an unauthorized individual to access voting equipment and election records. The person posted secure election equipment images online.\n\nPeters became \"fixated\" on voting problems after the 2020 presidential election that some falsely believe was rigged against Trump, prosecutors said.\n\nInvestigators also issued a search warrant for MyPillow founder Mike Lindell, a proponant of election fraud claims, in connection to Peters' case, BBC's American partner CBS News reported.\n\nPeters is set to be sentenced on 3 October. Her attorney could not be reached for comment.",

Tim Walz.\n\nFormer Rep. Denver Riggleman, once a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, was an adviser to the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6 insurrection. He described Trump as an \"inveterate liar\" and a \"conspiracy theorist.\"\n\n\"When you see the data and you see the awful things I've seen \u2014 you see the command-and-control infrastructure of Jan. 6th \u2014 there's no way as a Republican that I could vote for anybody who's anti-Constitution,\" Riggleman said.\n\ntoggle caption Matt Rourke/AP\n\nThe Trump campaign is now responding to the call, calling Harris \"dangerously liberal.\" In a statement to NPR, press secretary Karoline Leavitt did not specifically reference \"Republicans for Harris,\" instead echoing standard campaign talking points.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"President Trump is building the largest, most diverse political movement in history because his winning message of putting America first again resonates with Americans of all backgrounds,\" Leavitt said in the statement.\n\n\"Kamala Harris is weak, failed, and dangerously liberal and a vote for her is a vote for higher taxes, inflation, open borders, and war,\" she added.\n\nOn Tuesday night, several participants in the Republicans for Harris call did acknowledge that they do not always agree with Harris on policy. But, they argued, they believe Trump would endanger American democracy.\n\n\"When the Harris team wins and prevents the sudden death of American democracy, we can joyfully return to arguing over marginal tax rates and the role of government in health care and all the other issues that defined our politics for generations,\" said Craig Snyder, who leads a group called Haley Voters for Harris.\n\nSnyder's group recently received a cease-and-desist letter from former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who unsuccessfully ran for the Republican presidential nomination. Noting Harris' record as a former prosecutor, Snyder said he's trying to make the case to former Haley supporters and other center-right voters that Harris and Walz will govern from the center-left.\n\nSpeakers also sought to cast themselves \u2014 rather than Trump supporters \u2014 as the true inheritors of the GOP tradition, invoking former Republican presidents, including Ronald Reagan and the Bushes.\n\nAustin Weatherford, national Republican engagement director for the Harris campaign, noted that former President George W. Bush had described Trump as \"weird\" before Walz applied the term to the Republican nominee.\n\nRina Shah, a political strategist and former Republican National Convention delegate, framed a key voting issue for Democrats this year \u2014 abortion rights \u2014 in language designed to appeal to small-government conservatives. Shah referred to \"draconian bans\" supported by Republicans in multiple states since the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"When I see that happening, I think it's antithetical to the Republican Party I came up in,\" Shah said. \"I don't want the government in my backyard, my bedroom, my bank account and certainly not in the medical exam room.\u201d\n\nOvercoming the fear of stigma and rejection from Republican loved ones also emerged as a key theme during the call.\n\nRosario Marin, who served as U.S. treasurer under President George W. Bush, described voting for Trump as \"unacceptable\" but acknowledged that voting for a Democrat may cause strained relationships for some people.\n\n\"It is not easy to vote outside your party,\" she said. \"You may lose friends. Your neighbors may disagree with you. Family gatherings may turn uncomfortable. But at the end of the day, I can assure you that you will know in your heart that you did the right thing and that it's a worthwhile and noble cause.\"\n\nFormer Rep. Joe Walsh of Illinois acknowledged that it \"takes a lot of courage\" for many Republicans to publicly break with their party, but he argued it's necessary.\n\n\"You have to publicly out yourself: 'I'm a Republican, I'm a conservative, and I'm supporting Kamala Harris,'\" Walsh said. \"It takes courage, but remember: Donald Trump is unfit to be president.\"\n\nOrganizers said more than 70,000 people joined the call live, where speakers urged Republican participants to get behind Harris through volunteering and publicly supporting her campaign.",

        "text": "What we know about suspected Iranian cyber intrusion in the US presidential race\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Details emerged over the weekend of a suspected Iranian cyber intrusion into the campaign of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, potentially resulting in the theft of internal campaign documents.\n\nThe FBI is investigating the matter as well as attempts to infiltrate President Joe Biden\u2019s reelection campaign, which became Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 campaign after Biden dropped out of the race.\n\nHere\u2019s what we know:\n\nWhat happened?\n\nTrump\u2019s presidential campaign said Saturday that it had been hacked and that sensitive internal documents were stolen and distributed. It declared that Iranian actors were to blame.\n\nThe same day, Politico revealed it had received leaked internal Trump campaign documents by email, from a person only identified as \u201cRobert.\u201d The outlet said the documents included vetting materials on Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance and Sen. Marco Rubio, who also was considered as a potential vice president.\n\nTwo other news outlets, The New York Times and The Washington Post, also said they received leaked materials. None of them revealed details about what they had, instead describing the documents in broad terms.\n\nIt\u2019s still unclear whether the materials the news outlets received were related to Trump\u2019s alleged campaign hack. Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung indicated they were connected, saying the documents \u201cwere obtained illegally\u201d and warning that \u201cany media or news outlet reprinting documents or internal communications are doing the bidding of America\u2019s enemies and doing exactly what they want.\u201d\n\nThe FBI on Monday confirmed that it\u2019s investigating the intrusion of the Trump campaign. Two people familiar with the matter said the FBI also is investigating attempts to gain access to the Biden-Harris campaign.\n\nWhy is Trump blaming Iran?\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t provide specific evidence showing Iran was behind the hack. But it pointed to a Microsoft report released Friday that detailed an Iranian attempt to infiltrate a presidential campaign in June.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s report said an Iranian military intelligence unit had sent \u201ca spear-phishing email to a high-ranking official of a presidential campaign from a compromised email account of a former senior advisor.\u201d Spear-phishing is a form of cyberattack in which an attacker poses as a known or trusted sender, often to install malware or gather sensitive information.\n\nThe tech company wouldn\u2019t disclose which campaign or adviser was targeted, but said it had notified them. Since then, both Trump and a longtime friend and adviser of the former president, Roger Stone, have said they were contacted by Microsoft related to suspected cyber intrusions.\n\n\u201cWe were just informed by Microsoft Corporation that one of our many websites was hacked by the Iranian Government - Never a nice thing to do!\u201d Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Saturday.\n\nGrant Smith, an attorney for Stone, said his client \u201cwas contacted by Microsoft and the FBI regarding this matter and continues to cooperate with these organizations.\u201d He declined further comment.\n\nWhat does the government say?\n\nU.S. State Department officials declined to speculate on allegations that Iran was behind the hack, but a spokesperson said it would be in keeping with Tehran\u2019s past use of cyberattacks and deception.\n\n\u201cThese latest attempts to interfere in U.S. elections are nothing new for the Iranian regime,\u201d spokesperson Vedant Patel said on Monday.\n\nU.S. intelligence officials declined to comment on the incident and referred questions to the FBI, which has said only that it\u2019s investigating.\n\nIran\u2019s mission to the United Nations, when asked about the claim of the Trump campaign, denied being involved.\n\n\u201cWe do not accord any credence to such reports,\u201d the mission told The Associated Press. \u201cThe Iranian government neither possesses nor harbors any intent or motive to interfere in the United States presidential election.\u201d\n\nHowever, Iran long has been suspected of running hacking campaigns targeting its enemies in the Middle East and beyond. Tehran also has threatened to retaliate against Trump over the 2020 drone strike he ordered that killed prominent Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani.\n\nWas Harris targeted too?\n\nHarris\u2019 campaign has declined to say whether it has identified any state-based intrusion attempts, only saying it vigilantly monitors cyber threats and wasn\u2019t aware of any security breaches of its systems.\n\nBut two people familiar with the matter said the Biden-Harris campaign also was targeted in the suspected Iranian cyber intrusion. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the details of the investigation.\n\nAt least three staffers in the Biden-Harris campaign were targeted with phishing emails, but investigators have uncovered no evidence the attempt was successful, one of the people said. The attempts came before Biden dropped out of the race.\n\nThe FBI began investigating that cyber incident in June, and intelligence officials believe Iran was behind the attempts, that person said.\n\nWhere have I heard this before?\n\nA suspected foreign hack-and-leak of campaign materials might sound familiar because it\u2019s happened before \u2014 notably in 2016.\n\nThat year, a Russian hack exposed emails to and from Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, John Podesta. The website Wikileaks published a trove of the messages, which were reported on extensively by news outlets.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Tuesday noted the repeated use of the tactic against the U.S. and said it shows foreign adversaries are \u201cintent on sowing chaos and undermining our democratic process.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo we have to stand firm to ensure our cybersecurity can withstand such intrusions as we head into November,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nExperts say that the recent apparent hack of the Trump campaign is not likely to be the last such attempt to influence the U.S. election, either through cyberattacks or online disinformation. Both Iran and Russia, for example, have begun targeting Americans with fake news websites and other social media content that appears intended to sway voters, Microsoft and U.S. intelligence officials have said.\n\nThe nation\u2019s former top election security official, Chris Krebs, warned on the social platform X that Americans should take this threat seriously.\n\n\u201cYou might not like the victim here, but the adversary gives zero Fs who you like or don\u2019t like,\u201d he said of the Trump campaign hack. \u201cAmerican voters decide American elections. Let\u2019s keep it that way.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Alanna Durkin Richer, David Klepper and Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

Michael Luttig, a former appeals court judge and one of the nation's leading conservative legal voices.\n\nWe should note, by the way, that our own Judy Woodruff is a member of this task force.\n\nGentlemen, welcome to you both.\n\nSecretary Johnson, you have likened this effort to doctors on the front lines responding to the deadly COVID-19 pandemic. Why the urgency behind this call to lawyers?\n\nJeh Johnson, Former U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security: Democracy is at stake. We saw in 2016, 2017 how fragile our constitutional norms can be if there are those who are determined to try to push the envelope to the breaking point.\n\nThat environment continues. There is nothing to suggest that the threat stream from the challenges to our democracy have at all dissipated. Lawyers are uniquely situated, because of our legal training, the oath we take to support and defend the Constitution, and our ability to resolve conflict and mediate conflict.\n\nWe're in a unique situation to help voters, to help Americans participate in the democracy, encourage participation in the democracy, and try, most importantly, in my judgment, to turn down the rhetoric, the overheated rhetoric. We're concerned about the rise of political violence in this country, which is strictly bipartisan.\n\nAnd the two are related, the rhetoric and the rise in political violence. So we're issuing this call to lawyers. We believe the urgency is the same as it was for the medical community during COVID.",

The Office of the Secretary of State issued letters Tuesday to notify each nominating group of its qualification. Including nominees from the two major political parties, Washington voters will be able to choose from 11 pairs of nominees for president and vice president on the November ballot.\n\nTo qualify for the General Election ballot, a minor party or independent candidate must obtain 1,000 signatures from registered Washington voters who have not signed another party\u2019s nominating petition.

        "text": "Maine voters can request absentee ballots for Nov. 5 election\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nTuesday, August 13, 2024\n\nMaine voters can request absentee ballots for Nov. 5 election\n\nAUGUSTA \u2014 Secretary of State Shenna Bellows announced Tuesday Maine voters can request absentee ballots for the Nov. 5, 2024 General Election. While ballots themselves won't be available until 30 days before Election Day, Maine law allows voters to request ballots three months before Election Day.\n\n\u201cMaine\u2019s no-excuse absentee voting laws are foundational to our safe, secure and accessible elections,\u201d said Secretary Bellows. \u201cVoting in person on Election Day is always an option, but many busy Mainers find it more convenient to cast an absentee ballot, and those Mainers can put their request in now for the November election.\u201d\n\nVoters may request ballots online at https://apps.web.maine.gov/cgi-bin/online/AbsenteeBallot/index.pl or by contacting their town or city clerk. Contact information for municipal clerks is available at: https://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/munic.html.\n\nBallots will be issued to voters who have requested them in October as absentee ballots are made available 30 days prior to Election Day.\n\nMaine\u2019s no-excuse absentee voting period, including in-person absentee voting at town and city halls, continues through Thursday, Oct. 31.\n\nMaine voters need only to submit one request to receive their absentee ballot, once ballots are available.\n\n\u201cUtilizing the online absentee ballot request tool is a easy and secure way for busy Mainers to request an absentee ballot,\u201d said Deputy Secretary of State Julie Flynn. \u201cTheir town or city clerk will receive the request, and issue the absentee ballot when it is available in early October.\u201d\n\nOnce a ballot request is submitted, Maine voters can track the process of that request and their ballot at: https://apps.web.maine.gov/cgi-bin/online/AbsenteeBallot/ballot_status.pl. Voters who need a replacement ballot should contact their municipal clerk.\n\nAll absentee ballots must be received by a voter\u2019s municipality by 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\n###",

        "text": "How \u2018brat summer\u2019 may be propelling Kamala Harris to the American presidency\nCan TikTok help lead the Kamala Harris-Tim Walz campaign to victory in the United States presidential election the way Twitter, now X, was believed to have helped Donald Trump in 2016? Is Harris\u2019s so-called brat summer enough to sustain her momentum into four more years of a Democratic-led America?\n\nWith under 100 days left to election day in November, Harris\u2019s campaign has quickly taken flight, raising a record-breaking $81 million in just the first day of her candidacy and $310 million in the month of July alone.\n\nThe Democrats also have an unexpected supporter in singer and songwriter Charli XCX, who fuelled youth excitement with her tweet \u201ckamala IS brat.\u201d\n\nUp until a few weeks ago, many people \u2014 particularly those over 35 \u2014 probably wouldn\u2019t have had a clue what that meant. Today, young people across the U.S. and globally have embraced the term as it\u2019s been bestowed upon Harris.\n\nThe viral sensation quickly found its way into national news and late-night television, with NBC News even publishing a Venn diagram to make sense of it all.\n\nEmbracing \u2018messiness\u2019 of life\n\nLiving a brat summer and embodying \u201cbrat\u201d is all about embracing the messiness of life. In various interviews, Charli XCX defines a brat as someone who is \u201cvery honest, is very blunt, a little volatile.\u201d\n\nThe brat phenomenon has helped fuel a much-needed cultural renaissance for the Democratic Party, led by their newfound set of engaged followers \u2014 American youth.\n\nAfter Harris entered the race when U.S. President Joe Biden announced he wasn\u2019t running for a second term, Vote.org, a non-partisan platform in the U.S. dedicated to voter registration and get-out-the-vote technology, announced a nearly 700 per cent increase in voter registration. Almost all of these new voters are people under the age of 35.\n\nJust days after Charli XCX\u2019s viral tweet, Harris joined TikTok, the popular video and photo-sharing platform (that, incidentally, the U.S. has demanded must be sold by April 2025). As of last November, research shows that a third of Americans aged 18-29 are regularly getting their news from TikTok.\n\nHarris has since amassed more than 4.3 million TikTok followers and over 25 million likes on her videos.\n\nTikTok is illustrating the significant role the brat handle is playing in Harris\u2019s campaign. It\u2019s become inundated with content dedicated to Harris as brat, calling for a \u201cfemininomenon\u201d and galvanizing youth engagement as the vice president surges in the polls.\n\nAn opportunity unlike any other\n\nThere are more than 121 million Americans on TikTok despite the threats against the app in the U.S., making it the second-largest TikTok audience in the world next to Indonesia. This popularity, and TikTok\u2019s ability to mobilize young people in a country where they\u2019re consistently underrepresented in political institutions and elections, presents an opportunity for the Democrats unlike any other.\n\nHarris\u2019s good-natured demeanour \u2014 evident in her now-famous quote \u201cYou think you just fell out of a coconut tree?\u201d \u2014 has helped energize her campaign. While these isolated moments have boosted her profile and popularity, TikTok is turning them into viral sensations through user reproduction of memes.\n\n(AP Photo/Julia Nikhinson)\n\nIn 2016, Twitter was leveraged and deployed by Trump to great success. But the impact and role of social media on general elections isn\u2019t unique to the U.S.\n\nIn the 2013 Cambodian election, and the 2019 vote in India, social media was believed to have sowed divisive political narratives that fuelled aggressive nationalism.\n\n(AP Photo/Kin Cheung)\n\nEarlier this year, TikTok became a battleground for youth during the Indonesian election and was used to mobilize the youth vote in the British election.\n\nThe role that social media plays in shaping politics, specifically in the U.S., is nothing new.\n\nBut social media\u2019s ability to convert content engagement to voters at the polls is far more murky, compelling get-out-the-vote organizations like Voters of Tomorrow, which works in more than 20 American states and leverages influencer culture and the viral nature of social media, to try to ensure online engagement translates into votes.\n\nSustaining excitement\n\nYouth excitement about Harris is showing no signs of abating.\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Prachitha Porika, a young registered Democratic organizer, said in response to Harris\u2019s candidacy: \u201cAll of a sudden, just like that, we realized Gen Z can get their ass off their couch, get up and organize \u2026 they just needed the right people in office to inspire them.\u201d\n\nHarris\u2019s running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, noted this shift in energy on his own TikTok, publicly telling Harris:\n\n\u201cThe joy that you\u2019re bringing back to the country, the enthusiasm that\u2019s out there \u2026 it\u2019ll be a privilege to take this with you across the country.\u201d\n\nOther commentators are noticing the excitement, with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper arguing the success of Harris\u2019s brat summer is a direct result of \u201cgoing right for them (the youth) in a language of their own.\u201d\n\nConnecting with young Americans this way may clearly have an impact on voter turnout in November. While the \u201cKamala IS brat\u201d sensation and its TikTok enthusiasts seemingly took flight overnight, the real question is whether the momentum continues and young voters show up to cast their ballots.",

        "text": "Harris Energizes Democrats in Transformed Presidential Race\nStrong support for Harris is nearly 20 points higher than for Biden last month\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump at campaign rallies in late July. (Elijah Nouvelage/AFP and Brandon Bell, both via Getty images)\n\nHow we did this Pew Research Center conducted this study to understand Americans\u2019 views of the 2024 presidential race and the candidates running. For this analysis, we surveyed 9,201 adults \u2013 including 7,569 registered voters \u2013 from Aug. 5 to 11, 2024. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), a group of people recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses who have agreed to take surveys regularly. This kind of recruitment gives nearly all U.S. adults a chance of selection. Surveys were conducted either online or by telephone with a live interviewer. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other factors. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology. Here are the questions used for this report, the topline and the survey methodology.\n\nBuoyed by growing Democratic enthusiasm, Vice President Kamala Harris is now in a virtual tie with former President Donald Trump in the presidential race.\n\nAmong registered voters nationally, 46% say if the election were held today, they would support Harris, while 45% favor Trump and 7% back Robert F. Kennedy Jr. A month ago, Trump held a 4 percentage point lead over Joe Biden (44% vs. 40%), who withdrew from the presidential race on July 21.\n\nMost of Harris\u2019 gains have come at the expense of Kennedy, whose support has declined by roughly half in the past month, from 15% to 7%. Yet there are clear signs that Harris has energized Democratic voters, according to a new Pew Research Center survey conducted Aug. 5-11 among 9,201 U.S. adults, including 7,569 registered voters.\n\nHarris\u2019 strong support is on par with Trump\u2019s. Among Harris\u2019 supporters, 62% say they support her strongly, while 64% of Trump\u2019s supporters back him strongly. Last month, just 43% of Biden supporters backed him strongly, compared with 63% of Trump supporters who supported the former president strongly.\n\nBoth candidates\u2019 supporters are motivated to vote this fall. Following the stunning events of the past month \u2013 including Biden\u2019s withdrawal and the assassination attempt against Trump \u2013 supporters of both candidates are increasingly motivated to cast ballots this fall:\n\n70% of Harris supporters say they are \u201cextremely motivated\u201d to vote. That compares with 63% of Biden supporters who were extremely motivated in early July, when he was still in the race.\n\n72% of Trump supporters say they are extremely motivated, up from 63% last month.\n\nJump to Chapter 1 for more on voters\u2019 views of the presidential race.\n\nHarris performs better than Biden did across most demographic groups. While many of the demographic patterns in vote preferences echo the Biden-Trump matchup from July, Harris\u2019 gains have been particularly pronounced among some traditionally Democratic-leaning groups. Among voters under 50, Harris\u2019 support is 9 percentage points higher than Biden\u2019s was in July. And among Black, Asian and Hispanic voters, Harris\u2019 support is up at least 10 points compared with Biden\u2019s.\n\nFor more on voting preferences among demographic groups, visit the detailed tables.\n\nMost Democrats are \u201chappy\u201d Harris is the Democratic candidate. Nearly nine-in-ten Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters (88%) say they are happy that Harris is the Democratic candidate for president in November. Close to half (48%) say they are very happy that Harris is the party\u2019s candidate.\n\nOther findings: Both Harris and Trump are viewed more favorably than a few months ago\n\nHarris\u2019 favorability rises sharply among Democrats\n\nBoth Harris and Trump are viewed more favorably than they were in May, with virtually all of the gains coming from members of their own party. Since then, Harris\u2019 favorable rating has increased 8 points among all adults (from 36% to 44%), with an 18-point rise among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (from 65% to 83%).\n\nTrump\u2019s favorability is up more modestly overall, from 39% to 42%. About eight-in-ten Republicans and Republican leaners (79%) now view him favorably, up 5 points since May.\n\n\u2018Double negatives\u2019 decline\n\nIn May, with Biden still in the race, a quarter of Americans had unfavorable opinions of both him and Trump. That was the highest share expressing negative views of both candidates in surveys dating back to the 1988 presidential election. Today, however, the share of these \u201cdouble negatives\u201d has fallen to 14%.\n\nJump to Chapter 2 for more on favorability ratings.",

        "text": "FAU/Mainstreet Poll of Florida Voters on Races and Amendments\nFAU/Mainstreet Poll of Florida Voters on Races and Amendments\n\nFlorida voters weigh in on presidential race and proposed amendments\n\nAs the 2024 U.S. presidential race intensifies, a new poll from the Florida Atlantic University Political Communication and Public Opinion Research Lab (PolCom Lab) and Mainstreet Research USA reveals the shifting tides of politics in Florida, highlighting significant gender, age and racial divides among likely voters.\n\nTrump Maintains Narrow Lead Over Harris\n\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump holds a slight edge over U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris among likely Florida voters, with 50% supporting Trump and 47% backing Harris. This close margin suggests Florida\u2019s potential swing state status may return in the upcoming election.\n\n\u201cThe narrowing gap between Trump and Harris is consistent with the tightening we have seen in other states,\u201d said Kevin Wagner, Ph.D., professor of political science and co-director of the PolCom Lab. \u201cIf this trend holds, we may see a competitive race in Florida.\u201d\n\nGender, Age and Race Continue to Influence Voting Patterns\n\nFemale voters in Florida favor Harris by 53%, while Trump garners 43%. Among male voters, Trump leads with 56% compared to Harris\u2019 at 39%. Harris leads among voters aged 18-49 with 50%, while Trump is favored by those aged 50 and over with 53%. Harris receives strong support from Black voters at 77%, while Trump captures 17%. The Hispanic vote is evenly split at 49% for both candidates.\n\nSince the PolCom Lab/Mainstreet USA poll of Florida voters in April, Harris has reduced the gap between Democratic and Republican presidential candidates among voters in Florida from an 8% deficit to just 3%. In April, U.S. President Joe Biden trailed Trump by 8% among likely voters. This trend offers the Democratic Party hope of catching up with Trump in the remaining campaign period. However, Trump\u2019s support has remained stable since April, indicating that Harris\u2019 gains are primarily from strengthening support within traditional Democratic bases, such as women, Black voters, younger voters, and Democratic Party loyalists.\n\n\u201cKamala Harris restores the traditional base of the Democratic Party, which includes women, minorities, younger voters, and Democratic Party identifiers,\u201d said Dukhong Kim, Ph.D., associate professor of political science at FAU. \u201cWhile Donald Trump maintains his own established base.\u201d\n\nEarly returns in Florida suggest that voters liked the choice of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz for possible U.S. vice president. Among poll respondents, 44% approve with 34% having a more negative view. About one-quarter of voters do not have a specific opinion on Walz. This suggests he has room to improve his name recognition among voters.\n\n\u201cSo far, Tim Walz has been a help to Harris, but it\u2019s early and many voters are still learning about the Minnesota governor,\u201d said Wagner.\n\nFloridians\u2019 Opinions on the Proposed Amendments\n\nAbortion amendment: 56% of voters support an amendment ensuring no law shall prohibit abortion before viability, with the highest support from Hispanics at 66%. For males, 54% were in support of the abortion amendment compared to 59% of women, and 62% of 18- to 49-year-olds are in support. For Democrats, 80% are in support compared to 35% of Republicans, while 59% of Independents are in support.\n\nMarijuana legalization: 56% of all voters support legalization with younger voters (18-49)\n\nshowing the highest support at 69%, while only 47% of voters over 50 are in support of the amendment. For males and females, 56% support the amendment, while 74% of Democrats are in support compared to 37% of Republicans and 63% of Independents. For blacks, 57.9% are in support, and both white college-educated and white non-college-educated voters support the proposed amendment at roughly 56%. Hispanics were the largest group in opposition with 35.4% saying they would not support Amendment 3.\n\n\u201cThese results reflect a growing awareness of the constitutional amendments. In April, FAU polled on both initiatives and at that time these measures had 49% approval, which shows a gain of 7% over the last four months,\u201d said Luzmarina Garcia Ph.D., assistant professor of political science at FAU. \u201cFor these ballot initiatives to become a constitutional amendment in Florida\u2019s Constitution, 60% of voters need to agree since the rules for a constitutional amendment were changed by the Florida legislature in 2006.\u201d\n\nAmong all voters, 23% of respondents are not sure how they will vote for the abortion amendment, while 15% are unsure how they will vote with the marijuana amendment.\n\n\u201cThere is some evidence of greater turnout in elections when people can vote on more emotionally charged issues, including same-sex marriage and more recently abortion. However, this has primarily been in midterm elections when there is no election for president. With this being a presidential year, many of the people who would turn out to vote on one of these ballot initiatives would probably turnout anyway to vote for a president,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cThese voters that don\u2019t know how they would vote if faced with the ballot initiative could go either way come November.\u201d\n\nSenate Race and Additional Findings\n\nU.S. Senate race: Republican U.S. Sen. Rick Scott leads Democratic candidate Debbie Mucarsel-Powell 47% to 43% among likely voters.\n\n\u201cWhile Scott leads, there is increasing evidence that this race could be competitive in November,\u201d Wagner said.\n\nHeat and water breaks: An overwhelming majority of Florida voters, 85%, agree that cities and counties should have the authority to mandate heat and water breaks for outdoor workers. This sentiment is particularly strong among women, with 88% in favor, compared to 79% of men. Support is more pronounced among Democrats, with 95% backing the measure compared to 75% of Republicans.\n\n\u201cGov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill that prohibited Florida municipalities from requiring heat and water breaks for outdoor workers, preempting a recently enacted regulation in Miami-Dade County,\u201d said Aaron Veenstra, Ph.D., associate professor of journalism at FAU. \u201cThe state\u2019s preemption bill received little coverage at the time it was passed and signed, which may partially explain how something so unpopular with Florida voters across the political spectrum became law. Federal regulators are now looking at requiring heat and water breaks across the country, which has brought attention to the issue at the national level.\u201d\n\nHigh cost of living and school timing opinions: 38% of voters attribute the high cost of living to the federal government, while 29% blame the state government. As schools reopen, 41% of voters believe that the school start time is appropriate, though 31% wish school started later.\n\nNews consumption: 49% of voters listen to news radio at least four days a week, with older voters more likely to tune in daily.\n\n\u201cTalk radio remains a significant source of information for many voters, especially those with early morning and late afternoon commutes,\u201d said Veenstra. \u201cIts format often combines reporting and commentary, offering listeners both a chance to find out about issues and to find out how people like them think about issues. Local radio especially contributes to the sense of what people around us are thinking and thinking about, and often flies under the radar compared with newspapers, TV, and social media.\u201d\n\nThe poll was conducted from Aug. 10 to 11, sampling 1,055 registered Florida voters aged 18 and older. The survey was administered in both Spanish and English using Interactive Voice Response (IVR) and an online panel, ensuring a representative sample of the state\u2019s voting population. While a specific margin of error cannot be assigned due to the online component, a poll of this size typically has a margin of error of +/- 3% at the 95% confidence level, with higher margins for subsamples. This survey provides a snapshot of the Florida voting patterns at this point in time. For full methodologies, visit www.faupolling.com/about/.

        "text": "Biden on the trail: Will US president help or hurt Harris\u2019s campaign?\nExperts say Joe Biden\u2019s presence on the trail risks hurting Kamala Harris as her push for the White House gains momentum.\n\nIt was Kamala Harris\u2019s first public speech after incumbent Joe Biden withdrew from the United States presidential race \u2014 and the vice president spent much of it hailing her boss.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden\u2019s legacy of accomplishment over the past three years is unmatched in modern history,\u201d Harris told a crowd assembled on the White House lawn on July 22, a day after Biden dropped his re-election bid.\n\n\u201cIn one term, he has already surpassed the legacy of most presidents who have served two terms in office.\u201d\n\nIn the weeks since she made those comments, Harris has been confirmed as the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nominee. She has also named a running mate in Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, and her campaign has injected enthusiasm into what had been a largely lacklustre election season.\n\nYet despite Harris\u2019s praise that day at the White House, Biden has largely been absent from her campaign so far \u2014 prompting questions about whether his presence on the trail will help, or hinder, her efforts to win the presidency.\n\n\u201cI think Joe Biden will be a sounding board if asked by the Harris campaign,\u201d said Tatishe Nteta, the provost professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and director of the UMass Amherst Poll.\n\nHe said Biden, who ran a successful presidential campaign in 2020 and spent decades in Congress, will be able to offer advice on \u201chow to both effectively and efficiently leverage\u201d his experience, including by using his connections across key states.\n\nBut Nteta told Al Jazeera he doesn\u2019t think it strategically makes \u201cmuch sense to put Biden up front in the American people again. I don\u2019t see the benefit.\u201d\n\nBiden administration\u2019s record\n\nBiden, who dropped out of the race amid questions about his age and cognitive ability, said last weekend that he plans to campaign for Harris in the battleground state of Pennsylvania. He narrowly edged out his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump, in the state in 2020, effectively winning him the White House.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be campaigning in other states, as well. I\u2019m going to be doing whatever Kamala thinks I can do to help most,\u201d the US president told CBS News on Sunday.\n\nBiden is also set to speak on the first night of the Democratic National Convention, which runs from August 19 to 22 in Chicago.\n\nHe will no doubt use that address to heap praise on Harris while also touting the successes of his administration, including the passage of major pieces of legislation such as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nBut Biden has also been widely criticised on a number of issues during his term, from the surge in the number of migrants and asylum seekers crossing the US-Mexico border to his staunch support for Israel as it wages war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nHe remains a target of attacks by Republican lawmakers and Trump, the GOP\u2019s 2024 presidential candidate \u2014 and some of their anti-Biden talking points have shifted to Harris in the wake of her presidential bid.\n\nRepublicans have particularly slammed her record on immigration, falsely dubbing her the administration\u2019s \u201cborder czar\u201d. In reality, she had no authority over the border but was tasked with addressing the \u201croot causes\u201d of migration to the US from parts of Central America and Mexico.\n\nHarris also has faced sustained protests from key segments of the Democratic Party base over the administration\u2019s Israel policy. Advocates have publicly urged her to back an arms embargo against the top US ally in response to its deadly military attacks across Gaza.\n\n\u201cI think the genocide in Gaza that\u2019s been going on has been a real tarnish on Biden\u2019s legacy,\u201d said Hasan Pyarali, the Muslim Caucus chairperson for College Democrats of America, the university arm of the Democratic Party.\n\nAs a result, having Biden on the campaign trail risks hurting Harris, Pyarali told Al Jazeera. He said he believes Harris should make a clear break from Biden\u2019s stance on Israel.\n\n\u201cI think, in this case, that she has a really rare chance in politics to rebrand and take on a new identity as more progressive, as more youth-minded.\u201d\n\nPolicy, not just \u2018vibes\u2019\n\nBut both Pyarali and Nteta said that \u2014 while the Harris campaign has been able to build strong momentum in its first weeks, thanks in part to a strong social media presence \u2014 it will need to go beyond rhetoric and lay out clear policies to appeal to voters.\n\n\u201cShe has been putting out memes, but memes only get you so far,\u201d said Pyarali.\n\nHe stressed that this is particularly pivotal with the issue of the Gaza war. Pyarali said that Harris must break from Biden on Gaza \u201cand call not just for a ceasefire but an arms embargo on Israel until this war is over\u201d.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Biden administration announced it had approved the potential sale of more than $20bn in weapons to Israel, drawing fresh rebuke.\n\n\u201cShort of a policy change, you\u2019re going to run up a lot of the same issues that Joe Biden did,\u201d Pyarali said. \u201cShe has a chance here to really unite the party behind a new progressive vision for peace, and I hope she takes it.\u201d\n\nNteta said he believes Harris should still highlight the Biden administration\u2019s successes and her role in them, but she likely intends to strike out her own in order to appeal to Americans who had been frustrated with their previous options in the presidential race.\n\nBiden had originally been set to take on Trump \u2014 whom he defeated in 2020 \u2014 in what one political science expert had dubbed \u201cElection 2.0\u201d, effectively a \u201crematch\u201d between the two men.\n\nBut voters had signalled limited enthusiasm for the options. A Pew Research Center poll from April indicated nearly half of all registered voters would have replaced both Biden and Trump on the ballot if they could.\n\nIn early August, a UMass Amherst poll found 66 percent of respondents who backed Harris\u2019s candidacy said they did so because she \u201crepresents a new generation\u201d. If elected, Harris would be the first woman and the first Black and South Asian woman to serve as US president.\n\n\u201cPeople are looking for something distinct, something new,\u201d said Nteta.\n\nHarris, he added, will soon need to \u201cstart articulating what her policy positions are rather than just overarching positivity, enthusiasm and energy\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think defining who she is, is necessary,\u201d he told Al Jazeera, \u201cbecause at this point in time, Americans are really responding to vibes and not necessarily to policy.\u201d",

        "text": "Campaign cash: Will corporate America decide US election? \u2013 DW \u2013 08\nIn the US, election campaigns cost billions of dollars. The money comes mainly from billionaires and business leaders hoping to gain influence. Will the candidate who raises the most money win?\n\nThere is most probably no other political office in the world that requires so deep a pocket to win than that of the president of the United States. During their 2020 campaigns, then incumbent President Donald Trump and his challenger, Joe Biden, spent a combined $5.7 billion (\u20ac5.2 billion) to win over the hearts and minds of voters \u2014 a new record for a US presidential election, according to OpenSecrets, a US nonprofit which tracks and monitors campaign finance and lobbying.\n\nThis year's presidential campaigns are seemingly running just as smoothly when it comes to funds, with the war chest of Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party's candidate, bulging from the $310 million she reportedly received in donations in July alone.\n\nIn the same month, Republican Party candidate and former US President Donald Trump claimed to have received about $138 million in contributions, news agency Reuters reported.\n\nThe huge sums are raised not only through donations from countless small donors, but mainly from the superrich and corporate America.\n\nMoney makes US politics\n\nIt's no secret that those donating to fundraising campaigns often hope to foster their own goals with their contributions.\n\nLinkedIn co-founder and Microsoft board member Reid Hoffman, for example, made a $7 million contribution to the Democratic campaign, telling television news channel CNN later that he isn't happy with the head of the US Federal Trade Commission, Lina Khan, who was \"waging war on American business.\" He openly expressed his hope that Harris would \"replace\" her.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has also received political and financial backing from big donors, including Timothy Mellon, scion of the Pittsburgh banking family, who has put $50 million behind Trump. Tech investor David Sacks and Tesla CEO Elon Musk are also backing Trump.\n\nClose allies of Musk have formed a so-called super PAC to support Trump, which is expected to pump millions of dollars into Trump's reelection campaign. No Musk donations to the group have yet been disclosed to the Federal Election Commission, but those close to the billionaire have said he is expected to financially support the effort.\n\nThe so-called super Political Action Committees (super PACs) are independent political organizations to which donors can give unlimited amounts of money, while donations to individuals or non-super PACs are capped.\n\nDuring a live chat with Elon Musk on his social media platform X on Monday, August 12, Trump signaled his willingness to offer the Tesla CEO a role in his administration in a proposed so-called government efficiency commission. \"I think it would be great to just have a government efficiency commission that takes a look at these things and just ensures that taxpayer money... is spent in a good way,\" said Musk. \"I'd be happy to help out on such a commission.\"\n\nSupreme Court ruling opened donation spigots\n\nIn 2010, the US Supreme Court issued a ruling that's become a landmark in campaign-funding jurisdiction. J\u00f6rg Hebenstreit, an expert on US domestic politics and campaign finance at the University of Jena in Germany, described it as a turning point in US politics.\n\nThe court ruled that \"corporations may enjoy the same rights as natural persons,\" meaning that any restriction on political campaign financing is ultimately censorship, which is illegal. \"Since 2010, you can basically raise as much money as you want, whether you're a corporation, a bank, a union, an interest group, or a wealthy individual,\" Hebenstreit told DW.\n\nHowever, there are restrictions on direct donations. Currently, an individual can donate a maximum of $6,600 directly to candidates and their teams in the primary and general elections. In addition, there is the option to support a preferred candidate through PACs. Most PACs represent businesses, unions or interest groups and collect donations from members or employees. Individuals can donate up to $5,000 per year to such PACs. They can also give up to $41,300 per year to national party organizations.\n\nHuge donations came pouring in after Joe Biden made way for Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz Image: Charles Rex Arbogast/AP/dpa/picture alliance\n\nThe super PAC workaround\n\nHowever, those seeking to donate more than the mandated limits can establish super PACs which are essentially independent lobbying groups. The condition is that their advertising must not be directly coordinated with the candidates' campaigns. This condition is officially monitored by the Federal Election Commission. But Hebestreit said that the \"coordination ban\" can be \"circumvented through dozens of loopholes.\"\n\nAccording to OpenSecrets , during the current campaigns for US president, some 2,257 super PACs have already been formed. They've collected a combined $2 billion in donations, of which some $700 million have already been spent.\n\nJames Davis, a US political scientist from the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland, told DW that the sums are \"staggering\" and that analysts have \"never seen anything like this before.\"\n\nDoes campaign money wield influence?\n\nBut Hebestreit pointed out that research had shown that donations \"actually have little effect\" in US presidential campaigns. \"Both candidates are usually well-known, and whether they invest another $100 million ultimately has no impact on the actual election outcome,\" he said.\n\nDavis believes a minimum level of donations is certainly necessary to build a party organization for the campaign, and that it's \"crucial\" to motivate people to actually go to the polls. \"At the end of the day, though, it's important to have a message that resonates with voters,\" he added, pointing to Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign, which raised much more money than her rival Trump, but still didn't help her win.\n\nCould VP Kamala Harris beat Donald Trump in US election?

Eight out of 10 respondents believe people who donate money to political campaigns have too much influence on the decisions of Congress members, the independent nonpartisan think tank found.\n\nHowever, Hebenstreit believes there is little chance of curbing these financial flows because a change in the laws would require a political majority in Congress, which is currently lacking. After all, one reason why US campaigns are so expensive is that unlike those in other countries, they cannot rely on public campaign financing, he added.\n\nAdditionally, the entire party apparatus has to be rebuilt for each presidential election, Davis explained. \"You could almost say that a party only comes together on a federal level every four years, which means that this organization has to be rebuilt every four years, in 50 states and in the respective districts,\" he said.\n\nAnd finally, in a media-driven country like the US where most of the big networks are in private hands, running nationwide campaigns costs a lot of money.\n\nThis article was originally written in German.",

        "text": "Celebrities do have an impact on elections, Harvard study finds\nCelebrities do have an impact on elections, Harvard study finds\n\nWorld famous as entertainers, celebrities are not usually relied on for their political expertise.\n\nYet candidates across the political spectrum in 2024 have been keen on highlighting star power at their campaign events.\n\nMusical performances by Megan Thee Stallion, Quavo, and Bon Iver brought crowds to their feet during recent Kamala Harris rallies.\n\nLast month, musician Kid Rock and model Amber Rose were among the celebrities featured at the Republican National Convention.\n\nIt turns out, a new study finds, that celebrities do more than merely generate online buzz \u2013 they can actually influence elections.\n\nAccording to the research by Harvard University's Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation, there is \"rigorous evidence that [celebrity] voices are incredibly powerful\" in promoting civic engagement and altering polling numbers.\n\nMegan Thee Stallion performs at a campaign event for Democratic presidential candidate and Vice President Kamala Harris at a campaign rally at the Georgia State Convocation Center, July 30, 2024, in Atlanta. Megan Varner/Getty Images\n\n\"Right now, young voters have relatively low levels of trust in a lot of leaders and institutions, including traditional news media -- but celebrities are often a rare exception,\" Ashley Spillane, the study's author and a civic engagement and political expert, told ABC News.\n\nPublished on Friday, the study discusses how America falls behind other highly developed democratic nations in terms of the number of eligible voters who actually cast votes.\n\nSpillane noted that \"despite record-breaking voter participation levels in recent elections, the United States still ranks 31st out of 50 developed nations in terms of eligible voter participation.\"\n\nShe says lack of motivation and mobilization is one of the main reasons behind that ranking, and celebrities could be key in addressing the lack of participation.\n\nSpillane said the culture surrounding civic engagement needs to change.\n\n\"Voting should be the trendy, cool thing to do,\" she said. \"And the study shows there is evidence that when people feel this way about voting, they participate.\"\n\nIn terms of shifting this culture, celebrities are \"uniquely positioned to empower everyday Americans,\" the study said. Online voter registration and poll worker volunteer rates were found to increase when a celebrity promoted them.\n\n\"What the study finds is that sharing information that allows people to take action (a registration link, a way to find your polling place, when Election Day is!) can have the most impact,\" Spillane added.\n\nTaylor Swift performs at Wembley Stadium as part of her Eras Tour, June 21, 2024, in London. Scott A Garfitt/Invision/AP, FILE\n\nBack in 2018, Taylor Swift encouraged her fans to register to vote by posting a simple Instagram story, resulting in 250,000 new Vote.org registrants in 72 hours.\n\nIn a similar fashion, Kylie Jenner utilized Instagram to urge her followers to vote in 2020, and \"the site to which she linked reported a 1,500% increase in traffic compared to the day before -- and an 80% increase in total users registering to vote,\" the study said.\n\nActress Kerry Washington communicated outside her fanbase and recruited other celebrities to promote civic engagement. The study referenced $32 million in organic earned media coverage, as well as one billion online engagements as a result of her efforts.\n\nAriana Grande, David Dobrik, Hailey Bieber, Billie Eilish, Trevor Noah were among other celebrities studied. Offline engagements such as television, movies, and merchandise were included in the research set as well.\n\nThe study also emphasized how \"authenticity moves the needle on civic engagement,\" making it crucial for celebrity efforts to align with their public interests and overall platform in order to be effective.\n\nAlthough some celebrities remain wary of \"potential backlash and 'canceling,'\" the study found that those who encourage voter participation believe it is \"good for democracy\" and \"good for their brands.\"\n\nKerry Washington speaks with Rev. Al Sharpton in the panel \"The Power of our Vote\" onstage during the National Action Network 2023 Convention at the Sheraton Times Square Hotel, April 12, 2023, in New York. Selcuk Acar/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images, FILE\n\nAs seen throughout the current election cycle, celebrities have even inspired civic engagement without their explicit knowledge or intention.\n\nFor example, Swifties for Kamala represents a group of Taylor Swift fans promoting Harris' campaign. Their X account currently has over 57,000 followers.\n\nSwift has yet to comment on the group created in her namesake, or on the election itself.\n\nThough the Harvard study did not explicitly focus on such sub-groups, Spillane told ABC News that \"fan communities getting involved in civic engagement enables them to be a part of something collaborative, which helps build trust in the democratic process and motivation to participate.\"\n\nJust this past month, British hyperpop artist Charli XCX posted, \"Kamala IS brat,\" on X, amassing over 54.5 million views and catalyzing millions of memes and video edits. This one celebrity post inadvertently contributed to the Harris campaign's digital success and Gen-Z outreach.\n\n\"Charli XCX's post is a great example of a celebrity's ability to garner media coverage, attract large crowds, reach their fans, and influence conversation,\" Spillane observed.\n\nGen-Z and millennial groups are of particular importance given that they will comprise the majority of voters by 2028, the study confirmed. In addition to the significant screen time that both groups average each day on social media, such platforms were also found to be their primary source of news.\n\nGiven such findings, a close eye is likely to follow celebrity voices throughout the remainder of this historic and tumultuous election cycle.\n\n\"The evidence is clear that, using their powerful platforms, these influential figures can encourage and empower more everyday Americans to use their voices and exercise their civic rights,\" Spillane said.",

        "text": "August 14, 2024, presidential campaign news\nFormer President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, in July. Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n\nKamala Harris is officially the Democratic presidential nominee, but Donald Trump is continuing to describe the vice president\u2019s elevation to the top of her party\u2019s ticket as \u201cunconstitutional\u201d and accusing her of taking part in a \u201ccoup.\u201d\n\nNo serious effort to challenge Harris\u2019 status as the Democratic nominee is underway. But some of Trump\u2019s critics warn that the former president could be laying the groundwork to question the outcome of the 2024 election if he loses a second time.\n\nDemocrats are set to gather next week in Chicago for a national convention at which they\u2019ll rally around Harris as their new standard-bearer after President Joe Biden\u2019s decision not to seek reelection.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee made it official last week: Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz are the party nominees for president and vice president, respectively. Convention delegates held a virtual roll call ahead of the convention, with Harris receiving 99% support from the participating delegates.\n\nRepublicans have acknowledged that after the DNC vote, there is no longer any path to challenge Harris\u2019 placement on ballots.\n\nBut that hasn\u2019t stopped Trump \u2013 now facing a much closer race, polls show, than the one he\u2019d led against Biden \u2013 from complaining about Harris\u2019 ascension, which took place after Biden had swept the Democratic presidential primaries earlier this year.\n\nOne of Trump\u2019s intraparty foes said the former president\u2019s efforts to question the legitimacy of Harris as the Democratic nominee could be a way to lay the groundwork to question the legitimacy of this year\u2019s election.\n\n\u201cWe know one thing for sure: Trump never loses. And so if he\u2019s not declared the winner of 2024, as in 2020, it must be because he was treated unfairly yet again; it was stolen yet again,\u201d John Bolton, who was Trump\u2019s national security adviser and has since become a vocal critic of the former president, told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins last week.\n\n\u201cAnd I think this is why people need to start thinking more now about how to deny Trump the ability, the day after the election, if he loses, to try and throw the process into chaos again,\u201d he added.",

        "text": "Google says Iranian group trying to hack US presidential campaigns\nGoogle said Wednesday that an Iranian group linked to the country's Revolutionary Guard had tried to infiltrate the personal email accounts of roughly a dozen people linked to President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump since May.\n\nThe tech company's threat intelligence arm said the group was still actively targeting people associated with Biden, Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, who replaced Biden as the Democratic candidate last month when he dropped out of the presidential race. It said those targeted have included current and former government officials, as well as presidential campaign affiliates.\n\nThe new report from Google's Threat Analysis Group affirmed and expanded upon a Microsoft report released Friday that revealed a suspected Iranian cyber intrusion in this year's U.S. presidential election. It shed light on how foreign adversaries are increasing their efforts to disrupt the election that is now less than three months away.\n\nGoogle's report said its threat researchers detected and disrupted a \"small but steady cadence\" of the Iranian attackers using email credential phishing, a type of cyberattack where the attacker poses as a trusted sender to try to get an email recipient to share login details. John Hultquist, chief analyst for the company's threat intelligence arm, said the company sends suspected targets of these attacks a Gmail pop-up that warns them that a government-backed attacker might be trying to steal their passwords.\n\nThe report said Google observed the group gaining access to one high-profile political consultant's personal Gmail account. Google reported the incident to the FBI in July. Microsoft's Friday report had shared similar information, noting that the email account of a former senior adviser to a presidential campaign had been compromised and weaponized to send a phishing email to a high-ranking campaign official.\n\nThe group is familiar to Google's threat intelligence arm and other researchers, and this isn't the first time it has tried to interfere in U.S. elections, Hultquist said. The report noted that the same Iranian group targeted both the Biden and Trump campaigns with phishing attacks during the 2020 cycle, as early as June of that year.\n\nThe group also has been prolific in other cyber espionage activity, particularly in the Middle East, the report said. In recent months, as the Israel-Hamas war has fueled tension in the region, that activity has included email phishing campaigns targeted at Israeli diplomats, academics, nongovernmental organizations and military affiliates.\n\nTrump's campaign said Saturday that it had been hacked and that sensitive internal documents had been stolen and distributed. It said Iranian actors were to blame.\n\nThe same day, Politico revealed it had received leaked internal Trump campaign documents by email, though it wasn't clear whether the leaked documents were related to the suspected Iranian cyber activity. The Washington Post and The New York Times also received the documents.\n\nWhile the Trump campaign hasn't provided specific evidence linking Iran to the hack, both Trump and his longtime friend and former adviser Roger Stone have said they were contacted by Microsoft related to suspected cyber intrusions. Stone's email was compromised by hackers targeting Trump's campaign, a person familiar with the matter said.\n\nGoogle and Microsoft wouldn't identify the people targeted in the Iranian intrusion attempts or confirm that Stone was among them. Google did confirm that the Iranian group in its report, which it calls APT42, is the same as the one in Microsoft's research. Microsoft refers to the group as Mint Sandstorm.\n\nHarris' campaign has declined to say whether it has identified any state-based intrusion attempts but has said it vigilantly monitors cyber threats and isn't aware of any security breaches of its systems.\n\nThe FBI on Monday confirmed that it's investigating the intrusion of the Trump campaign. Two people familiar with the matter said the FBI also is investigating attempts to gain access to the Biden-Harris campaign.\n\nThe reports of Iranian hacking come as U.S. intelligence officials have warned of persistent and mounting efforts from both Russia and Iran to influence the U.S. election through their online activity. Beyond these hacking incidents, groups linked to the countries have used fake news websites and social media accounts to churn out content that appears intended to sway voters' opinions.\n\nWhile neither Microsoft nor Google specified Iran's intentions in the U.S. presidential race, U.S. officials have previously hinted that Iran particularly opposes Trump. U.S. officials also have expressed alarm about Tehran's efforts to seek retaliation for a 2020 strike on an Iranian general that was ordered by Trump.\n\nIran's mission to the United Nations, when asked about the claim of the Trump campaign, denied being involved.\n\n\"We do not accord any credence to such reports,\" the mission told The Associated Press. \"The Iranian government neither possesses nor harbors any intent or motive to interfere in the United States presidential election.\"\n\nThe mission did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday about Google's report.",

        "text": "Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian\u2019s Remarks on August 14, 2024\nXinhua News Agency: MFA released on its website a report entitled The National Endowment for Democracy: What It Is and What It Does. Can you tell us more about it?\n\nLin Jian: With detailed facts, the report reveals the truth about the NED under its professed banner of democracy and human rights.\n\nThe NED is engaged in instigating color revolutions to subvert state power in other countries, colluding with all sorts of elements to meddle in other countries\u2019 internal affair, inciting division and confrontation to undermine the stability of other countries, fabricating false information to mislead public opinion, and using \u201cacademic activities\u201d as a cloak for interference and infiltration. That includes targeting China by supporting \u201cTaiwan independence\u201d separatist forces, inciting activities for \u201cXinjiang independence\u201d, \u201cHong Kong independence\u201d and \u201cTibet independence\u201d, and orchestrating subversive and infiltration activities against China\u2019s political security and social stability.\n\nWhat the NED does has grossly violated other countries\u2019 sovereignty, security and development interests, breached international law and basic norms of international relations, and jeopardized world peace and stability, which is despised by people who stand for fairness and justice in the world.\n\nPeace, development, fairness, justice, democracy and freedom are the humanity\u2019s common values. Every country has the right to pursue a development path suited to its national realities and the needs of its people. No country is in a position to lecture others on democracy and human rights, still less using democracy and human rights as excuse to hurt other countries\u2019 interests. Members of the international community need to have exchanges and dialogue on the basis of mutual respect and equality, and work together to contribute to the progress of humanity.\n\nChina News Service: It was reported that Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence Richard Marles said on August 12 that Australia has signed a cooperation agreement with the US and the UK on nuclear-powered submarines that will enable the three countries to exchange nuclear-related material and information. What is China\u2019s comment on this?\n\nLin Jian: China noted the reports. AUKUS nuclear-powered submarine cooperation harms efforts to keep the region peaceful and secure. The US, the UK and Australia formed AUKUS to advance cooperation on nuclear-powered submarines and other cutting-edge military technologies. Their moves exacerbate the arms race, undermine the international nuclear non-proliferation regime, incite bloc politics and military confrontation and hurt regional peace and stability. China and relevant countries in the region have expressed more than once serious concerns and firm opposition.\n\nAUKUS nuclear-powered submarine cooperation contravenes the object and purpose of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The cooperation involves the transfer of nuclear-powered submarine reactors and a large amount of weapons-grade highly enriched uranium from nuclear-weapon states to a non-nuclear-weapon state, which constitutes grave nuclear proliferation risks. IAEA\u2019s existing safeguards system cannot place effective safeguards on that, and major controversy exists on the interpretation and application of relevant safeguards provisions. Many countries have already expressed their concerns during the recent second session of the Preparatory Committee for the Eleventh Review Conference of the Parties to the NPT.\n\nChina calls on the international community to take seriously the impact of AUKUS nuclear-powered submarine cooperation on the authority and effectiveness of the NPT, and its negative effect on the IAEA safeguards regime. The international community needs to continue to advance the intergovernmental process and address the world\u2019s concerns over the legal and technical issues involved in the cooperation through the IAEA, the NPT review process and other platforms. Until the international community reaches consensus on safeguards and other issues, the US, the UK and Australia should not proceed with their nuclear-powered submarine cooperation.\n\nThe Paper: It is reported that recently Shigeru Ishiba, former LDP secretary-general and member of the House of Representatives of Japan, along with other Japanese parliamentarians visited the Taiwan region and met with its leader Lai Ching-te and others. What\u2019s China\u2019s comment?\n\nLin Jian: I noted the report. There is but one China in the world. Taiwan is an inalienable part of China\u2019s territory. We firmly oppose any form of official interaction between the Taiwan region and countries having diplomatic ties with China and have lodged serious protests with the Japanese side.\n\nThe Taiwan question is at the very core of China\u2019s core interests. It bears on the political foundation of China-Japan relations and is a red line that must not be crossed. Japan committed innumerable crimes during its 50 years of colonial rule over Taiwan, and is responsible for the enormous sins witnessed by history against the Chinese people. We call on certain Japanese politicians not to forget the lessons of history and to recognize the fact that there is but one China in the world and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China\u2019s territory. They should adhere to the one-China principle and the spirit of the four political documents between China and Japan, and stop sending wrong signals to the \u201cTaiwan independence\u201d separatists. The DPP authorities\u2019 separatist position for \u201cTaiwan independence\u201d and attempt to achieve that by collaborating with external forces will not get them anywhere.\n\nRIA Novosti: It is reported that former US President, the Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said that he does not rule out the possibility that China would \u201ccatch up, maybe even surpass\u201d the US in terms of nuclear arsenal. In an interview with Elon Musk on the social media platform X, he said: \u201cRussia and us are No.1, and we are sort of tied, and China is far behind, but they are developing at a level that you are not surprised to hear, very fast, they\u2019ll end up catching up, maybe even surpassing.\u201d What\u2019s China\u2019s comment?\n\nLin Jian: We have no comment on campaign rhetoric during the US presidential election. The nuclear arsenal of the US is way bigger than China\u2019s. Let me just note that China follows a policy of \u201cno first use\u201d of nuclear weapons and a nuclear strategy that focuses on self-defense. China always keeps its nuclear strength at the minimum level required by national security, and never engages in arms race with anyone.\n\nCNN: According to space monitoring agencies and the US Space Command, one of China\u2019s Long March 6A rockets, after being launched from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center on August 6, broke apart in low-Earth orbit last week. Multiple space debris-tracking entities said the breakup created a debris cloud consisting of hundreds of pieces. Can you confirm this and provide the latest monitoring information? What measures is China taking to monitor and deal with the debris? What has China done to prevent similar incidents from happening again in the future? (Similar questions from Bloomberg, DPA and RIA Novosti)\n\nLin Jian: The mission of the rocket was a peaceful use of the outer space consistent with international law and universal practice. China has taken necessary measures and is closely monitoring relevant orbit area and conducting data analysis. As a responsible major country, China attaches great importance to space debris mitigation. In conducting outer space activities, China has taken active efforts to fulfill relevant international obligations and regulate its aerospace activities. We\u2019ve made it a rule to always take space debris mitigation measures after satellites and carrier rockets complete their missions, in order to help protect the environment of the outer space and ensure the long-term sustainability of outer space activities.\n\nAP: Has China had any direct or indirect outreach to Iran over its threatened retaliatory strike for the killing of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran? Has China urged Iran not to strike? If so, why? And has China had any outreach to Hamas or others over the group\u2019s decision not to take part in new cease-fire talks?\n\nLin Jian: China has been calling for international efforts to bring an early end to the conflict in Gaza as soon as possible and prevent further spillover. China plays an active role in easing regional tensions. We support all efforts that contribute to permanent and comprehensive ceasefire in Gaza, and will work with the international community to deescalate the situation and avoid further escalation of the conflict and confrontation.\n\nTV Asahi: Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced that he will not run in Liberal Democratic Party\u2019s leadership vote. What is China\u2019s comment on Prime Minister Kishida\u2019s decision? What\u2019s your comment on him as prime minister over the past three years? How will his stepping down affect China-Japan relations? (Similar questions from Kyodo News, Asahi Shimbun and Yomiuri)\n\nLin Jian: We have noted the announcement. This is Japan\u2019s domestic affair. We have no comment on it. China and Japan are important neighbors. China hopes to work with Japan in the spirit of the four political documents between China and Japan to comprehensively advance the strategic relationship of mutual benefit and work to build a constructive and stable China-Japan relationship fit for the new era.",

A traditionally Republican state, Flordia is the place where Ron DeSantis scored a 19-point blowout in the 2022 elections. But, this is no more the case in this battleground state . In the USA TODAY/Suffolk/WSVN-TV Florida survey, Donald Trump received the support of 47% of voters, while 42% of people backed Kamala Harris. The poll was conducted over the phone from August 7 to August 11.According to 'USA Today', Florida is the state where Donald Trump bested Joe Biden by 3.3 percentage points in the 2020 election, and DeSantis dominated two years later in the election for governor. Besides, Democrats fell dramatically behind Republicans in voter registration. The state now has one million more registered Republicans than Democrats.David Paleologos, Director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center told USA Today, given those circumstances, he was surprised that Harris is within striking distance being only 5 points down. He also said Harris is \"still an underdog, but she's a little bit closer than people might expect.\"However, Kamala Harris may be encouraged to know that Florida voters are matching the former Republican president's supporters in enthusiasm. About 89% of each group said they were excited to vote for their candidate. A USA TODAY/Suffolk national poll held in June found that about 60% of Joe Biden's supporters nationwide were excited to vote for him. It increased significantly after the incumbent president stepped aside and endorsed the vice president last month.The first black president is viewed somewhat more favorably than Biden in Florida. This is evident by the fact that about 44% of voters say they have a favorable opinion of her compared with the president's 39%, though that is also within the poll's margin of error.In the USA TODAY/Suffolk/WSVN-TV Florida survey, Donald Trump received the support of 47% of voters, while 42% of people backed Kamala Harris.About 89% of each group said they were excited to vote for their candidate.

        "text": "Jump in Enthusiasm for 2024 Race | Monmouth University Polling Institute\nDownload This Poll Report with Crosstabs\n\nNational\n\nWest Long Branch, NJ \u2013 Democrats\u2019 enthusiasm has skyrocketed since they swapped their presidential nominee. The latest national Monmouth (\u201cMon-muth\u201d) University Poll finds voter support for Vice President Kamala Harris slightly higher than it was for President Joe Biden, while the number who back former President Donald Trump has remained steady. Harris has higher favorability ratings than either Trump or Biden, which means there has been in a decline in the number of double haters, that is voters who dislike both nominees. Harris also has a clear advantage over Trump in being seen as having the necessary stamina for the job and matches or slightly edges her Republican opponent on understanding people\u2019s concerns, representing American values, and bringing about change.\n\nA huge shift in enthusiasm is the most vivid finding in the poll. While the number of voters who were at least somewhat enthusiastic about the Trump versus Biden rematch had been increasing throughout the year, it never topped 50%. Now that the contest is Trump versus Harris, voter enthusiasm has risen to 68%. The biggest jump has been among Democrats (from 46% in June to 85% now), but there has also been a notable increase in enthusiasm among independents (from 34% to 53%). Among Republicans, enthusiasm for the Trump-Harris contest (71%) is identical to what it was for the Trump-Biden rematch in June (71%).\n\nMonmouth also asked specifically about enthusiasm for each party\u2019s choice of nominee. The national electorate\u2019s enthusiasm for Trump as the Republican nominee (41%) is basically unchanged from February (40%). However, enthusiasm for Harris as the Democratic standard-bearer (47%) is significantly higher than it was for Biden earlier this year (32%). Currently, Democratic voters are slightly more enthusiastic about having Harris as their nominee (92%) than Republicans are about having Trump at the top of their ticket (84%). Back in February, Republican enthusiasm for Trump was similarly high (80%), but Democratic enthusiasm about the prospect of Biden being their nominee was significantly lower (62%).\n\n\u201cThis is clearly a different ballgame. The nominee change has raised the ceiling for potential Democratic support in the presidential contest by a small but crucial amount, at least for now,\u201d said Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute.\n\nJust under half of registered voters say they will either definitely (38%) or probably (10%) vote for Harris in November and, in a separate question, just over 4 in 10 will definitely (33%) or probably (10%) support Trump. About half say they will definitely not vote for Trump (49%), while a somewhat smaller number say they definitely will not vote for Harris (44%). Trump support levels are virtually unchanged from Monmouth polls conducted since the fall. Support for Harris is stronger than it was for Biden, both in terms of total overall support (48% compared with between 42% and 44% for Biden between September and June) as well as the number who have definitely ruled her out (44% compared with a higher 48% to 51% for Biden).\n\nHarris\u2019s entry into the race has improved Democratic support among younger voters (53% of 18- to 35-year-old voters) compared to where Biden stood with this group two months ago (33%). At the same time, she has maintained Biden-level support among older voters, including those age 65 and over (51%, similar to Biden\u2019s 52% support level with this group in June). Harris gets 62% support from Hispanic, Black, and Asian voters, 57% support from white voters who graduated college, and 33% support from white voters without a college degree. These results are a few points higher than where Biden stood with these groups in June.\n\nOne feature of the Trump-Biden race was the so-called double haters \u2013 voters who held an unfavorable view of both candidates. Nearly 1 in 5 registered voters fell into this category when Biden was still running. That number remains virtually unchanged as it applies to Biden and Trump in the current poll \u2013 with 17% of voters not having a favorable opinion of either man. However, with Harris now in the race, the number of double haters for the current nominees has been cut in half. When favorability ratings for Harris and Trump are combined, just 8% do not have a favorable opinion of either candidate. Monmouth\u2019s June poll found that 54% of the double haters were not supporting either candidate, with 28% backing Biden and 19% backing Trump. In the current poll, Harris actually holds majority support (53%) among these Biden-Trump double haters, with just 11% voting for Trump and 35% backing neither candidate.\n\n\u201cTaking Biden out of the mix and replacing him with Harris has significantly altered a key metric in this race. As we reported last month, Trump-Biden double haters want to shake things up, but they are wary of change that is too authoritarian. Harris appears to provide most of this group with the fresh outlook they desire,\u201d said Murray.\n\nMonmouth asked about potential support for four independent and third-party candidates, although none have yet been officially certified for the ballot in all 50 states. The number of voters who say they will definitely support one of these candidates includes 2% for independent Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., 1% each for independent Cornel West and the Green Party\u2019s Jill Stein, and less than 1% for the Libertarian Party\u2019s Chase Oliver. Combining those who say they will definitely or probably vote for one of these options shows Kennedy with 14% potential support, Stein with 4%, West with 3%, and Oliver with 2%. The potential vote for these other candidates seems to have an equal impact on both major party nominees. When definite independent and third-party support is included in the mix, Trump and Harris each lose just one percentage point from their initial backing. When all potential support for these four candidates is included, each major party nominee loses seven points off their initial support levels.\n\nThe ability to simply carry out the job of president dominated the election conversation before Biden dropped out. Currently, 57% of voters are at least somewhat confident that Harris has the mental and physical stamina necessary for the presidency, while 47% say the same about Trump. Confidence in Trump\u2019s ability is a few points lower than in February (51%), but confidence in Harris\u2019s ability is significantly higher than it was for Biden earlier this year (32%).\n\n\u201cThe center of gravity has clearly shifted when it comes to talking about the candidates\u2019 ability to carry out the job. Of course, the fact that this metric is not even higher for the 59-year-old is just another example of how entrenched partisan tribalism has become in the American electorate,\u201d said Murray.\n\nHarris (45%) matches Trump (46%) when it comes to confidence in bringing about the kind of change our country needs, although more voters say they are very confident in Trump. Harris has a small advantage when voters are asked how much the candidates understand the day-to-day concerns of people like them \u2013 49% say she understands this a great deal or some compared with 44% who say the same about Trump. Harris (51%) edges Trump (48%) when it comes to being seen as representing true American values either a great deal or some.\n\nIn other poll findings, 48% of voters currently support the Democratic congressional candidate in their U.S. House district, while 46% back the Republican. Monmouth\u2019s June poll showed this generic national House ballot at 48% for the Republicans and 45% for the Democrats.\n\nIn terms of personal ratings, Harris (48% favorable and 50% unfavorable) has an advantage over Trump (43% favorable and 56% unfavorable), although neither candidate\u2019s rating is a net positive. Turning to their running mates, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has a net positive rating (37% favorable and 30% unfavorable) while Ohio U.S. Senator J.D. Vance has a net negative one (36% favorable and 41% unfavorable). About one-third of voters have not heard of or have no opinion of Walz and about a quarter cannot rate Vance. Among other presidential candidates, Kennedy has a net negative 32% favorable and 42% unfavorable rating. The vast majority of voters do not know enough about the other three presidential candidates included in the poll to offer an opinion on them.\n\nThe Monmouth University Poll was conducted by telephone and online from August 8 to 12, 2024 with 801 registered voters in the United States. The question results in this release have a margin of error +/- 4.0 percentage points. The poll was conducted by the Monmouth University Polling Institute in West Long Branch, NJ.\n\nQUESTIONS AND RESULTS\n\n(* Some columns may not add to 100% due to rounding.)\n\n[QUESTIONS 1 & 2 WERE ROTATED]\n\n1.

Monmouth is responsible for all aspects of the survey design, data weighting and analysis. Interviews were conducted in English, and included 145 live landline telephone interviews, 280 live cell phone interviews, and 376 online surveys via a cell phone text invitation. Interviewing services were provided by Braun Research using telephone numbers randomly selected from a list of active registered voters obtained from Aristotle. The full sample is weighted for region, age, gender, race and listed partisanship based on the voter list and education based on US Census information (2022 CPS and 2021 ACS one-year surveys), with adjustments made for self-reported 2020 presidential vote. For results based on this sample, one can say with 95% confidence that the error attributable to sampling has a maximum margin of plus or minus 4.0 percentage points adjusted for sample design effects (1.32). Sampling error can be larger for sub-groups (see table below). In addition to sampling error, one should bear in mind that question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of opinion polls.\n\nDemographics (weighted)\n\nParty (registration/inferred from vote history): 36% Republican, 34% Democrat, 30% other, none\n\nParty (self-reported): 32% Republican, 39% Independent, 29% Democrat\n\nSex: 47% men, 51% women, 1% other\n\nAge: 24% 18-34, 23% 35-49, 26% 50-64, 27% 65+\n\nRace: 70% White, 11% Black, 13% Hispanic, 6% Asian/other\n\nEducation: 30% high school or less, 31% some college, 24% 4 year degree, 15% graduate degree\n\nClick on pdf file link below for full methodology and crosstabs by key demographic groups.",

        "text": "Asian American Voters Could Be Key Swing Voters of 2024\nGood evening! Tonight, we\u2019re looking at the role Asian Americans could play in the 2024 election. Amy Qin, a national correspondent who covers Asian American communities across the country, will take it from here. \u2014 Jess Bidgood\n\nOne thing you often hear about Asian American voters is that they primarily vote Democratic.\n\nThat\u2019s been true since as early as 2008, the year that nationally representative surveys about Asian Americans were first conducted. And in 2020, Asian American voters cast ballots for Joe Biden over Donald Trump, then the president, by roughly two to one.\n\nBut look a little closer, and the data reflects a more complex picture.\n\nWhile Asian American voters do mostly vote Democratic, they tend to have weaker party affiliation. So, as both parties work furiously to find persuadable voters in a presidential election that is widely expected to be close, Asian Americans could emerge as a target for both parties.\n\n\u201cAsian Americans are the quintessential swing voter group,\u201d said Karthick Ramakrishnan, the founder and executive director of AAPI Data, a research organization that focuses on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.",

        "text": "RFK Jr.'s quest to get on the presidential ballot in all 50 states\nWashington \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s team is still aiming to be eligible for 270 electoral votes, the number needed to clinch the presidency, with voters set to begin casting their ballots as early as next month.\n\nKennedy's campaign has been working to get him on the ballot in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, but he has some hurdles to overcome.\n\nKennedy is on the ballot as an independent in a growing number of states \u2014 Alaska, Delaware, Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Washington and West Virginia. He's also on the ballot in California as the nominee of the American Independent Party, and in Hawaii, on his We the People ticket. Combined, those states add up to just over 200 electoral votes.\n\nBut New York is denying Kennedy access to the ballot, based on his residency claim. And he's facing challenges in Pennsylvania, Nevada, Delaware and Georgia, as well as an objection to his candidacy in Illinois.\n\nGetting on the ballot in enough states to secure 270 votes \u2014 just over half the 538 votes in the Electoral College \u2014 is no small feat for a third-party contender. The Kennedy campaign is still pushing, since many states have deadlines this month.\n\nFile: Robert F. Kennedy Jr., during a campaign event in Oakland, California, on Tuesday, March 26, 2024. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nThe Kennedy campaign in April said it's trying to evade legal battles by picking the right time to hand in the petitions, holding onto the signatures until the 11th hour in hopes that the signatures will face fewer challenges.\n\nIn addition to varying state regulations for ballot access and expensive legal battles, Kennedy faces opposition from Democratic groups aiming to undermine third-party campaigns.\n\nEarlier this year, the Democratic National Committee formed a team to challenge third-party and independent presidential candidates. The effort will depend on other groups like Third Way, MoveOn, and a new super PAC, Clear Choice, backed by allies of President Biden.\n\nThe stakes are high and we know this is going to be a close election,\" said DNC spokesperson Matt Corridoni. \"That's why a vote for any third-party candidate is a vote for Donald Trump.\"\n\nThe Kennedy campaign in April said it planned to secure ballot access in all 50 states, dismissing suggestions that Kennedy aims to help former President Donald Trump's bid for the presidency by taking votes from Mr. Biden.\n\n\"Our campaign is a spoiler. I agree with that. It's a spoiler for President Biden and for President Trump,\" Kennedy said when he revealed his running mate, Nicole Shanahan, in March.\n\nIn some states, the time frame for collecting signatures is brief. Others have provisions for signature thresholds to be reached in every county of a state. More than half the states require independent candidates to have a running mate.\n\nCollecting enough signatures isn't difficult in every state. Many only require 1,000 to 5,000 signatures. Louisiana requires no signatures and a $500 fee. Other states have higher thresholds. Texas requires over 113,000 signatures, and Florida requires more than 145,000.\n\nAnd those are the number of valid signatures required. Any third-party candidate needs to overshoot that target in order to make sure they have enough in case some of the signatures are found to be invalid.\n\nThe Kennedy campaign says it's aiming to collect 60% over the signature threshold in each state.\n\n\"We have the field teams, volunteers, legal teams, paid circulators, supporters, and strategists ready to get the job done,\" said campaign press secretary Stefanie Spear. \"We are exceeding all our benchmarks and will be announcing new states each week.\"\n\nBut Bernard Tamas, associate professor at Valdosta State University who studies third parties, said Kennedy should be aiming higher \u2014 closer to double the required number of signatures.\n\n\"I'm surprised they're saying it's as low as 60, you just can't take any chances,\" Tamas told CBS News in April.\n\nCollecting signatures is expensive. Kennedy's super PAC estimates that it will cost around $40 to $50 million just to collect all the necessary signatures, although Tamas noted RFK Jr.'s running mate, Shanahan, the billionaire ex-wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin, has the financial resources.\n\nCollecting the signatures isn't the hardest part \u2014 it's the battle over the signatures that's the real fight, Tamas said. The Democratic Party will be fighting hard to invalidate Kennedy's signatures.\n\n\"You really have to prepare for a battle, so a lot of the cost is not actually getting the signatures, but actually the legal fees of fighting each state,\" Tamas said.\n\nHistorically, there have been independent candidates who secured ballot access across nearly all states. In 1968, George Wallace, the former governor of Alabama, and in 1992, businessman Ross Perot both appeared on the ballot in all 50 states. Ralph Nader's candidacy in 2000 extended to 43 states.\n\nOnly Wallace managed to win any electoral votes. Perot's impressive 19% of the popular vote in 1992 did not translate to any success in the Electoral College.\n\nPerot's former campaign manager, Russell Verney, said third-party candidates must overcome more obstacles today than in the past.\n\n\"Every time there's a reasonably successful independent candidate, the state legislatures, which are made up of Republicans and Democrats, who by definition do not like competition, increase the state barriers to getting on the ballot,\" Verney said in April. \"The requirements to get on these state ballots continues to get more onerous in every election cycle.\"\n\nA successful third-party candidate has to focus on individuals who aren't being represented by the major parties, and that's a problem for Kennedy.\n\n\"He's all over the place, and it's really not clear what's the disaffected group he's trying to tap into,\" said Tamas. \"He's running on conspiracy theories is part of it. But if someone's a conspiracy theorist, chances are they're going to support Donald Trump.\"\n\nKennedy's support is likely to drop off before November, Tamas predicted in April.\n\nBut it's not yet clear whether Mr. Biden or Trump stands to lose more from Kennedy's presidential bid.\n\n\"Nobody really knows for sure who he's going to take votes from,\" Tamas said.",

        "text": "Brain worms and dead bears: has RFK Jr finally tanked his presidential bid?\nThe controversy over Robert F Kennedy Jr\u2019s exploits with a dead bear cub is just the latest bizarre twist to hit his presidential campaign and see him become a \u201claughingstock\u201d, political experts said, but a laughingstock who, against all odds, could still have a serious impact on the election.\n\nKennedy, the scion of the Democratic political family who is running as an independent candidate, was already known for unusual beliefs and actions before last week. His long-shot campaign for president had survived Kennedy\u2019s claim that part of his brain was eaten by a worm, his longtime anti-vaccine activism, and his recent denials that he had eaten a dog.\n\nBut the latest controversy to emerge around Kennedy might be the strange straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. On 4 August it emerged that Kennedy had found a dead bear cub on the side of the road, loaded it in the back of his car, taken a photo with the corpse, gone to do some falconing, had a steak dinner, then staged the decomposing bear\u2019s death to look like a bicycle hit-and-run incident in a local park before heading to the airport.\n\n\u201cAs soon as you start becoming a laughingstock in the public mind, you know you\u2019re in trouble,\u201d said Marjorie Hershey, professor emeritus of political science at Indiana University Bloomington. \u201cAnd when the two most prominent things people think about when they think of RFK Jr is brain worms and dead bear cubs, you\u2019re definitely in trouble.\u201d\n\nAs soon as you start becoming a laughingstock in the public mind, you know you\u2019re in trouble Marjorie Hershey\n\nKennedy revealed the bear cub incident in an interview with Roseanne Barr, in an apparent attempt to get ahead of an article in the New Yorker. But it\u2019s not clear his explanation of why he drove around with a dead bear in the trunk of his car helped his cause. Kennedy who was 60 years old at the time, told Barr that the bicycle accident aspect of the incident was done because he thought it would be \u201camusing\u201d, but few seem to agree.\n\nIt was especially unhelpful for Kennedy given his polls have been dropping for some time. Earlier in the year Kennedy was averaging about 10% of the national vote \u2013 currently he averages about half that. While Kennedy, as an independent candidate, was always very, very unlikely to win the election outright, he was hoping for a strong performance \u2013 something that now seems unlikely.\n\nHershey said, however, that given the majority of Americans are not engaged in day-to-day politics, Kennedy\u2019s early strong performance was always something of a mirage.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m sure that there was a certain proportion of people who just heard the name Robert F Kennedy Jr, and attributed to him some of the qualities that they remembered in his father, or who just have a certain kind of shine to the Kennedy name,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAnd so virtually anything they hear about him is likely to tarnish that initial feeling as people get more information.\u201d\n\nWhile the bear cub incident was unsavory, there have been weightier complaints against Kennedy. In July a former babysitter for Kennedy told Vanity Fair that Kennedy assaulted her at his home in 1998. Kennedy responded by stating: \u201cI am not a church boy.\u201d\n\nPart of perhaps why we\u2019re seeing his numbers shrink is because of his credibility issues Emmitt Riley\n\nLast year he was forced to apologize after he claimed that Covid-19 was \u201ctargeted to attack Caucasians and Black people\u201d, while Kennedy has claimed that wifi causes \u201cleaky brain\u201d and has linked antidepressants to school shootings. In 2023 he claimed that chemicals in water were making children transgender, while Kennedy has longstanding, and wrong, beliefs about apparently any and all vaccines.\n\nThe video of Kennedy talking about how he hauled a bear carcass into the back of his car, then later staged a scene which attempted to make it look like the bear had been killed by a cyclist, might not actually be the most damaging footage of Kennedy to have emerged in the past month.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The video came after reports \u2013 denied by Kennedy \u2013 that he might drop out and endorse Trump.\n\n\u201cPart of perhaps why we\u2019re seeing his numbers shrink is because of his credibility issues. This bizarre story about the bear, coupled with this video a few weeks ago speaks directly to the candidate\u2019s credibility, and some voters may simply have a second look. His supporters may become disillusioned and decide not to participate at all,\u201d said Emmitt Riley, a professor of politics and African and African American studies at Sewanee University and the chair of the National Conference of Black Political Scientists.\n\nTrump\u2019s outreach suggests that he is fearful of Kennedy\u2019s quixotic campaign. Kennedy\u2019s aggressive attitude towards the border crisis, and promises to take on the Washington elite are reminiscent of some of Trump\u2019s pledges, means they are fishing in at least parts of the same pool.\n\n\u201cI see him more as a threat to Donald Trump, given that his supporters are looking for more of an \u2018alternative\u2019. I do not see voters who even at this stage would vote for RFK remotely even considering supporting Kamala Harris,\u201d Riley said.\n\nBut despite Kennedy\u2019s past as an anti-vaccine campaigner who drove around with a dead animal in his car, and his present as an oddity, a punchline and someone sinking in the polls, Riley said he could still have an impact on the election \u2013 given how close the vote is expected to be in key swing states.\n\n\u201cWhen we think about the margins that states like Michigan, Wisconsin, any of those midwestern states were decided in the last election, every single vote is going to count,\u201d Riley said.\n\n\u201cAnd so if it comes down to 30,000 votes, if it comes down to 5,000 votes, a small portion there [for Kennedy] would likely have a major impact on either Donald Trump\u2019s ability to get to 270 or Kamala Harris\u2019s ability to get to 270. And I think that that is what many people are concerned about.\u201d",

        "text": "Kamala Harris rises in polls. See what election odds bettors give her now\nMirroring the results of recent polling, offshore bettors now think Democratic nominee Kamala Harris will defeat Republican nominee Donald Trump in November's presidential election.\n\nThe odds on Polymarket, a crypto-trading platform, swung in favor of the vice president on Saturday night as she and running mate Tim Walz concluded their four-day tour of five battleground states.\n\nAs of Aug. 26 at 9 a.m. EDT, the betting \u2013 which legally can't be done in the U.S. \u2013 put the likelihood of Harris winning the election at 50% and Trump's at 50%. A month ago, bettors placed Trump's odds of winning as high as 71%.\n\nTrump's polling at odds with bettors:See where 2024 election betting odds stand after Labor Day\n\nAfter the convention:See the odds bettors gave Harris' and Trump's campaigns following their conventions\n\n2024 presidential election predictions\n\nUnable to view our graphics? Click here to see them.\n\nThe odds on Polymarket represent current betting patterns and don't suggest a potential margin of victory as polling does, but the outlooks for Harris and Trump changed significantly in the past four weeks. The bets closely track the movements of Real Clear Politics' poll average.\n\nHow presidential odds track with recent polling\n\nWill Trump win? Odds nearly as accurate as a coin flip so far\n\nWithin this election cycle, the Polymarket bettors predicted days in advance that Ohio Sen. JD Vance would become Trump's running mate and Harris would become the Democratic nominee. Conversely, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro was a runaway favorite on the betting site \u2013 except for just the penultimate day when Walz held the lead.\n\nReal Clear Politics notes that on Aug. 13, Biden led Trump by more than 7 points in 2020. On the same date in 2016, Hillary Clinton led Trump by just under 7 points.\n\nHarris became the favorite four days before Biden dropped out\n\nBettors, as well as American voters, still have much more to consider between now and Nov. 4 \u2013 from the Democratic National Convention next week to the first Trump-Harris debate scheduled for Sept. 10.\n\nHow accurate have election odds been in past presidential elections?\n\nThe betting favorite has only lost twice since 1866, according to the Conversation, a nonprofit news organization.\n\nThe two upsets came in 1948 when Democrat Harry Truman beat eight-to-one odds to defeat Republican Thomas Dewey, and in 2016 when Trump overcame seven-to-two odds to beat Hillary Clinton.\n\nContributing: James Powel",

        "text": "Health Policy and the 2024 Election\n\u201cOver the last 20 years there has been a rise in deaths from opioids, and that really escalated during the pandemic. Now, more than 100,000 people per year die of an overdose,\u201d says Patrick.\n\nAs a result, there\u2019s been broad bipartisan support for ending the crisis, even if people disagree on the methods. \u201cWe've seen multiple pieces of legislation and initiatives that have happened over the last eight years. Everything from the declaration of a national emergency to the SUPPORT Act,\u201d says Patrick.\n\nPatrick would know. He testified at the Senate to help inform the creation of the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities (SUPPORT) Act in 2018. This legislation provided funding for community-based treatment and recovery services, and it also required Medicaid to cover medications for opioid use disorder.\n\nThe Biden-Harris administration has used a very intentional harm reduction approach, explains Patrick. Harm reduction techniques like clean needle programs and the distribution of overdose reversal kits serve people who want to use substances more safely. For example, the Food and Drug Administration made overdose reversal kits available over-the-counter in 2023, albeit at a high sticker price.\n\nHarris has a strong record of action to fight the opioid crisis. As vice president, she met with state attorneys general to discuss federal and state-level action against illicit fentanyl and expanding access to treatment for people at risk of overdose. During her tenure as California attorney general, she filed a lawsuit against pharmaceutical companies to lower the cost of opioid addiction treatment.\n\nOn the other hand, Trump is focused on tackling the issue from the supply side. He plans to declare a \u201cwar\u201d on cartels, designate them as terrorist organizations, and levy military action and embargoes against them. He would collaborate with neighboring governments to destroy the cartels and expose corruption.\n\nPatrick points out that the drug market is complex. Not all drugs come from cartels across the border, and some even enter the country legally. Plus, drugs like fentanyl can be made synthetically. \u201cIt's not like the days where you had to grow a crop,\u201d he says.\n\nHistorically, the focus on eliminating drug supply has simply led people to switch to other drugs. \u201cThe opioid crisis is a great example of that,\u201d explains Patrick. \u201cWe had a prescription opioid crisis, so then we enacted policies that tried to decrease the supply. And what we saw were higher prices on the street for prescription opioids.\u201d As a result, people turned to heroin, which was cheaper, and then fentanyl, which was even cheaper.\n\n\u201cWe have a long history in the U.S. of fighting a drug war and that was largely ineffective,\u201d Patrick says. What\u2019s more, it villainized people who used substances, especially people of color.\n\n\u201cWe know that public health approaches rather than criminal justice approaches are more effective,\u201d Patrick adds. \u201cThere is no question that we have to do a better job of limiting the supply of illicit fentanyl in the U.S., but that can't be the only solution. We need vast expansion in treatments. We need harm reduction. We need a comprehensive approach that really does have to be grounded in public health.\u201d\n\nStory by Deanna Altomara\n\nDesigned by Linda Dobson\n\nIllustration by John Jay Cabuay",

        "text": "Is Ohio a red state in 2024? It\u2019s complicated.\nAbout a week after President Joe Biden stepped aside and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to run for president as the Democratic Party\u2019s nominee, her campaign announced 25 events in 10 states. Ohio was not on the list. That\u2019s a clear sign that Harris\u2019 team expects Donald Trump to win the state, as he did in 2020 and 2016. Various polls at that time showed Trump with around a 10-point lead.\n\nBut the same polls were showing U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat, leading Republican challenger Bernie Moreno, who\u2019s endorsed by Trump, by 4 to 5 points.\n\nThe term \u201cred state\u201d \u2014 meaning reliably Republican \u2014 is most often used in the context of presidential races. But that\u2019s the view from 35,000 feet. On the ground, it\u2019s more complicated.\n\nGet live election updates and results after polls close at 7:30 p.m.\n\nWhat does Ohio voter affiliation data show?\n\nOhio does not require people to choose a party affiliation when registering to vote. Instead, the Ohio Secretary of State, who\u2019s in charge of elections, tallies affiliation data after the fact, mostly from vote totals from primary elections over the previous two years. (This data is anonymous. No one in state or county government can see your votes.)\n\nAccording to figures released in May, there are:\n\n\u2022 817,063 Democratic voters\n\n\u2022 1,508,641 Republican voters\n\nBut both of those totals are dwarfed by the number of \u201cunaffiliated\u201d voters, people who did not vote in a Democratic or Republican primary in the previous two elections: 5,734,850. Were they unhappy with the choices in the primaries? Were they just not paying attention to politics at the time? (Ohio\u2019s primary election is held in March.) It\u2019s hard to say.\n\nIn 2021, there were even more unaffiliated voters (6,196,547), and Democrats outnumbered Republicans (947,027 to 836,080).\n\nBut in both years, the numbers were influenced by the parties themselves. In 2020, Democrats had a hotly contested primary, which Biden eventually won, and Trump was essentially unopposed. In 2024, that was reversed.\n\nBut nothing shows the complexity of Ohio voters\u2019 views better than ballot initiatives.\n\nWhen issues are on the ballot\n\nIn Ohio, citizens can bypass the state legislature and give all voters the chance to amend the state constitution or create or repeal a law. These are commonly called ballot initiatives. It\u2019s a complicated process, and in 2023 Republicans tried to make it even harder, apparently because they knew that when issues are on the ballot instead of candidates, voters are a lot less reliably \u201cred.\u201d\n\nAnd sure enough, later that year, Ohio voters passed two ballot measures \u2014 a constitutional amendment ensuring reproductive rights, including abortion, and a new law legalizing recreational marijuana use \u2014 that were strongly opposed by the entire Ohio Republican Party and many of its allies.\n\nThose outcomes nearly matched the results of a 2022 survey of Ohio voters conducted by the Baldwin Wallace University Community Research Institute. The results of that survey showed that voters are not in lockstep with the Republicans who win most statewide races and control the legislature.\n\nAmong the findings:\n\n\u2022 Abortion: 59% of voters said they would amend Ohio\u2019s constitution to make access to abortion a fundamental right. (And they did.)\n\n\u2022 Recreational marijuana: 58% believed recreational use of marijuana should be legalized. (Did that too.)\n\n\u2022 Gun control: Majorities of all demographic groups, including conservatives and gun owners, supported additional restrictions on guns, including background checks.\n\n\u2022 Teaching racism and sexual orientation: Three-quarters of Ohioans surveyed supported teaching both the history and impact of racism to public school students, while 57% supported teaching middle and high schoolers about sexual orientation.\n\n\u2022 Climate change: A majority of respondents supported steps to mitigate the impact of climate change.\n\n\ud83d\uddf3\ufe0fFor more on this year\u2019s November election, visit our Election Signals 2024 page.\n\nRepublicans still dominate state government\n\n\u201cAt the end of Gov. DeWine\u2019s term [in 2027], Republicans will have held the governorship for 32 of 36 years\u201d and other statewide elected offices for similar periods, said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of the politics newsletter Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball and author of \u201cThe Bellwether,\u201d a book on Ohio\u2019s historical role in presidential elections.\n\nAnd in the Ohio House of Representatives and Ohio Senate, where the races are not statewide but by district, Republicans hold supermajorities (68% of the seats in the House and 78% in the Senate).\n\nKondik said he believes Republicans would still hold majorities if they didn\u2019t also control the process of drawing district boundaries, but smaller ones. And, he added, \u201cPerhaps Democrats could win a majority in the legislature with a nonpartisan map and a big wave\u201d of Democratic voter turnout, as in 2006 and 2018.\n\nWhat\u2019s a \u201cnonpartisan map\u201d? That\u2019s at the heart of the next constitutional amendment that Ohioans will vote on.\n\nThe Citizens Not Politicians amendment is intended to end gerrymandering, the old practice of drawing political district boundaries in ways that benefit one party over another. Both parties have used gerrymandering to their own advantage at different times and in different states. In Ohio today, it\u2019s the Republicans who benefit.\n\nYou can read more about gerrymandering and the proposed amendment in this Signal Cleveland explainer.\n\nGovernor DeWine recently announced his opposition to the amendment. But Fair Districts Ohio, the organization behind the amendment, gathered about 120,000 more signatures than were needed, and in more counties, to get the measure on the ballot. And if the amendment passes, it won\u2019t just be another example of Ohio voters defying the party that they keep sending back to office, but also taking away some of its power.",

        "text": "Biden-Harris Administration Issues Memorandum Supporting Improvements to Federal Hiring Experience\nWashington, D.C. - Today, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a joint memorandum to provide guidance to federal agencies on how to improve the hiring experience for job applicants, managers, and HR professionals.\n\n\u201cWe aim to continuously improve the federal government\u2019s ability to recruit, hire, and retain a diverse and skilled workforce to strengthen the way agencies deliver on their missions for the American people,\u201d said OPM Acting Director Rob Shriver. \u201cThis memorandum builds on that success and is a culmination of years of data-driven and innovative thinking about the federal hiring experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cImproving government hiring is essential to bringing onboard the next generation of leaders who reflect our mission and possess the skills needed to meet mission and serve the public,\u201d said Volcker Alliance President Sara Mogulescu. \u201cI am glad to see OPM and OMB collaborating to ensure that agencies thoroughly integrate this important suite of hiring reforms into their operations and culture.\u201d\n\n\"This memo is a strong step forward in improving the federal hiring experience,\" said Tech Talent Project Co-Founder and Executive Director Jennifer Anastasoff. \"Many tech, data, and AI professionals - and beyond - are eager to serve their country. It's exciting to see the federal government looking to best-in-class recruitment and retention strategies to attract and keep folks who are critical to delivering services, enforcing laws, and protecting our country. This initiative will allow agencies to build the diverse talent pool necessary to meet today's challenges.\"\n\nThe memorandum will provide guidance to federal agencies to:\n\nStrengthen agency\u2019s strategic workforce planning, recruitment, hiring, and data analytics.\n\nImprove the federal applicant experience, including expanding recruitment efforts to bring in diverse skills and experiences, and developing improved application processes that are user-friendly, accessible, and efficient for the public.\n\nProvide hiring managers with tools and training to improve their hiring strategies, processes, and internal customer experience.\n\nEmpower HR professionals with innovative actions and hiring strategies that enable them to recruit, retain, and advance talent to support agency missions, programs and requirements.\n\nTo support federal agencies with the implementation of this memorandum, OPM issued the following Fact Sheets on resources and tools:\n\nAgencies will be asked to track and share progress on improving the hiring experience and present results on the implementation of this memo to the President\u2019s Management Council. Additionally, OPM will be monitoring progress through key Hiring Experience metrics.\n\nThis memo builds upon work OPM has done over the last three years to improve federal agency hiring. For example, OPM has:\n\nHelped agencies successfully hire over 8,000 targeted federal positions in support of Bipartisan Infrastructure Act implementation.\n\nSupplied skills-based assessments, when requested, to agencies in support of quality federal hires, with over 100 available skills and competency-based assessments ready to be used, on-demand.\n\nIssued several rules to improve hiring, including a final rule updating the Pathways Programs to enable more early career talent to join government and to facilitate easier conversion to permanent positions. Interim final rules on the College Graduates Hiring Authority and Post-Secondary Hiring Authority further help agencies built their pipeline of talent for the future; a final rule on the 10-year Term Appointment for Certain STEM Professionals allows agencies to make a 10-year term appointment for certain STEM employees for specific roles; and a Reinstatement final rule gives agencies the discretion to reinstate certain former federal employees noncompetitively at any grade level for which the individual is qualified.\n\n\n\n\n\nMade strategic changes to USAJOBS to support hiring, including a redesigned USAJOBS homepage based on job seeker feedback to improve applicant experience, an improved search functionality, publishing a series of videos on how to apply for federal positions, a new functionality in the USAJOBS Agency Talent Portal allowing federal agencies to view and select candidates more easily; and a new Agency Talent Pools feature to support the sharing of certificates across government.\n\nCreated a new Hiring Experience (HX) Group that is partnering with agency Talent Teams to drive innovative assessment and hiring practices.\n\nUpdated and published 80 occupation-specific general competency models that serve as resources for agencies to leverage in their skills-based hiring practices.\n\nLed cross-government hiring actions in numerous fields including Data Scientist, Budget Analyst, IT Specialist, and Contract Specialist and supported agencies\u2019 increased use of agency shared certificates.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has championed the use of shared certificates to streamline the Government\u2019s hiring process which has helped ensure that it continues to recruit and hire top talent for its mission critical work. \u201cBy using shared certificates, we expedite the hiring process by filling vacancies from the shared certificate of candidates who have already completed rigorous assessments and have been determined qualified,\u201d said HHS Chief Human Capital Officer Bob Leavitt. \u201cSpecifically, we hire as many qualified candidates as possible from every solicitation, which reduces hiring timelines and processes.\u201d Over the past four years, HHS has made over 13,000 hires from shared certificates across the Department. \u201cThe use of shared certificates is an extraordinary opportunity to improve the federal hiring experience by simplifying and streamlining the hiring process,\u201d said Leavitt.\n\nOPM continues to support agencies to help drive federal hiring improvements and innovations through its HX Group. In addition to the tools and resources already in-place to support this work, over the next several months OPM will host a hiring manager symposium and additional trainings and webinars for HR professionals and hiring managers to help reinforce the actions and initiatives outlined in the memo. to help reinforce the actions and initiatives outlined in the memo.",

        "text": "US elections 2024: Trump's baseless claims about crowds at Harris rallies\nDonald Trump has accused Kamala Harris's communications teams of faking one of the photos of his August 7 arrival at Romulus Airport in Michigan, by AI generating a fake crowd. BHAVIK LATHIA\n\nOn August 10, on his Truth Social network, Donald Trump accused his rival Kamala Harris of faking photos of her arrival at Detroit airport, where she was holding a meeting with her running mate Tim Walz. \"There was nobody at the plane, and she 'A.I.'d' it, and showed a massive 'crowd' of so-called followers, BUT THEY DIDN'T EXIST!\" alleged the former US president. \"This is the way the Democrats win Elections, by CHEATING \u2013 And they're even worse at the Ballot Box\" added the Republican candidate, who continues to insist that his rival Joe Biden's election victory in November 2020 was \"stolen.\" In his message, he called for the vice president to be \"disqualified\" for this \"fake image\" that constitutes \"election interference.\"\n\nTrump cited an analysis from a Trump activist claiming that the crowd not being reflected in the plane's fuselage was proof that the audience had been added digitally. However, video footage of the scene taken by Harris's campaign manager, as well as many reports from local and national US media easily resolved this seeming contradiction by showing that the substantial number of Democratic activists were actually in a hangar located away from the tarmac. Photographed from behind with a long focal length, they appeared much closer to the aircraft than they actually were, as illustrated by a 3D reconstruction. As the aircraft's fuselage is cylindrical, it only reflects a crushed, barely perceptible reflection. An optical effect that Donald Trump misinterpreted as a magic trick performed by artificial intelligence.\n\nBut while the photo showed signs of HDR (high dynamic range, an automated digital processing that corrects backlighting), it features \"no evidence of AI-generation,\" said Hany Farid, professor of computer science at UC Berkeley and a specialist in visual retouching. \"This is an actual photo of a 15,000-person crowd for Harris-Walz in Michigan,\" retorted, a touch mockingly, Harris's official campaign account, without managing to convince the opposite camp.\n\nKamala Harris supporters wait for the vice president and Democratic candidate in the hangar facing the tarmac at Detroit Metropolitan Airport in Romulus, Michigan, on August 7. JEFF KOWALSKY / AFP\n\nWave of photo-fixing accusations\n\nSupporters of the Republican billionaire declined the accusation and increased the number of suspicious posts on social media, with zoomed-in images and red circles, claiming that this or that face, this or that deformed arm in a meeting photo would be the sign of an artificially generated audience.\n\n\"Kamala Harris is so unpopular that they have to use AI to fake crowd sizes on TV for her rallies\" insisted a pro-Trump poster. \"Do these faces and hands look real to you? It\u2019s fake. It\u2019s. All FAKE\" added another. Back in late July, a CNN reporter already had to defend herself for having altered a photo, taken with her iPhone, of a line of Democrats at a fundraiser.\n\nMost of these accusations are based on extremely zoomed-in details, often showing blurred or even deformed faces. Here again, the explanation is technical: from a certain extreme degree of magnification, the number of pixels in the camera is no longer sufficient to reproduce details as fine as a face.\n\nThis kind of limitation is familiar to iPhone users: lacking a true optical zoom, most modern smartphones rely on algorithms to extrapolate the details of very distant objects. While they may look good at a distance, up close they present plenty of distortions.\n\nTrump boasts about crowds of supporters\n\nThe frequent conspiratorial attacks by Donald Trump and his supporters show that the billionaire is finding it hard to believe that Harris is gaining momentum in the campaign and is now leading the polls in key swing states, which are often crucial in determining the election outcome.\n\nFaced with these headwinds, the Republican candidate has continued to boast about his popularity. \"Nobody's spoken to crowds bigger than me,\" he claimed at a press conference on Thursday, August 8.\n\nTrump even claimed to have attracted more people in front of the White House on January 6, 2021, than Martin Luther King did for his famous \"I have a dream\" speech in 1963. In reality, the crowd was about five times smaller, corrected The Telegraph.\n\nFake pro-Trump activists generated by AI\n\nDemocratic activists have shared fake photos in the past. In March, a fake photo featuring a Trump rally with a crowd size that was roughly multiplied by four was circulated. This kind of example remains marginal, however, and is not based on AI, but on ordinary image duplication techniques.\n\nOn the other hand, authentic manipulations on the pro-Trump side use artificial intelligence generation. For example, there is a recent deep fake (an algorithmically generated fake) attributed to Russia by the anti-disinformation medium Newsguard, in which a voice replicating Barack Obama's claims that the attempted assassination of Donald Trump had been sponsored by the Democratic Party.\n\nMore recently, Elijah Schaffer, a journalist for the far-right media outlet The Gateway Pundit, also enjoyed sharing an image of a Trumpist crowd, which, in turn, has all the hallmarks of an AI-generated photo.",

        "text": "News Bureau\nRobert Bruno is a professor of labor and employment relations at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and the director of the Project for Middle Class Renewal, a research-based initiative tasked with investigating labor policies in today\u2019s economy. Bruno, the author of the book \u201cWhat Work Is,\u201d spoke with News Bureau business and law editor Phil Ciciora about the state of the American worker.\n\nWhat\u2019s the state of labor and the labor movement in 2024?\n\nIt\u2019s a tale of varying perspectives on a different set of numbers, each of which tells a different story.\n\nOn one hand, the national unionization rate in 2023 held steady at 10% of the eligible labor force. However, the country added union members for the second consecutive year. In total, there were 14.5 million union members in 2023. But overall employment has grown faster than total union membership, causing membership rates to fall to their lowest levels in 10 years. On a positive note, the number of unions filing election petitions with the National Labor Relations Board is up and the number of workers organizing is the highest since 2014.\n\nImportantly, workers are organizing in industries traditionally considered difficult to organize and largely written off. Organizing also is now following some of the forces of economic development \u2014 for example, logistics, warehouse, technology, retail, online media, professional services, education. Today, roughly 100,000 of the United Auto Workers\u2019 approximately 400,000 members are university employees. Workers not historically viewed as ripe for organizing are also joining unions. For example, 46% of workers covered by union contracts have a bachelor\u2019s degree or more. And it\u2019s the first time since labor\u2019s \u201cglorious 30 years\u201d of the 1940s-1970s that new labor organizations are being formed.\n\nThe biggest example is the Amazon Labor Union, which has merged with the Teamsters union. These are campaigns spearheaded by workers themselves, with professional labor organizers playing a supportive role.\n\nThe UAW is also actively organizing auto facilities in the South and at current electric vehicle plants, and is positioned to do so as EV assembly plants come online. Success at these employers would represent important growth that would have a ripple effect across the labor market.\n\nThe past year has been a contentious one for labor. Have strikes increased or decreased?\n\nThe total number of work stoppages, approximate number of workers involved in stoppages and strike days have increased each year over the past three years. The reason why? Unions have demonstrated more capacity to use the strike to improve working conditions and wages.\n\nPresident Biden has been labeled the most pro-labor U.S. president ever. Now he\u2019s a lame duck, and former President Trump has made some in-roads with organized labor. How do you explain that?\n\nFirst of all, President Biden has earned the status of most pro-labor president ever. On every measurable indicator, he\u2019s used his office to herald the benefits of collective bargaining and protect and promote the rights of workers to organize beyond what other presidents have ever done. And without question, labor unions have done considerably better during the Biden administration than when Trump was in office.\n\nNonetheless, Trump did attract some white male union worker support in 2016 and 2020, and will likely do so again in the 2024 election. While Trump offers no genuine support for organized labor, decades of bipartisan genuflection to myths about the free market have harmed, angered and disillusioned working class folks. In response, some union and nonunion workers have sought out an avatar to express their feelings of alienation.\n\nThe disenfranchisement that working class voters felt in 2016 also fueled the populism on the left of Sen. Bernie Sanders. Sanders and Trump are radically different in character and politics. Sanders\u2019 critique of the political economic system was informed by an understanding of extreme income and wealth inequality, and the role of racism. Sanders\u2019 prescription was to bring democracy to the marketplace. Trump\u2019s prescription was massive tax cuts for the wealthy and greater extraction of wealth from the bottom to benefit the top. Sanders believed in more democracy inside and outside of the workplace. Trump fashioned himself like a 19th-century robber baron and insisted that workers and citizens simply do what was dictated to them by the corporate elite.\n\nDespite their differences, however, both were able to tap into white middle-class discontent. One post-2016 election report found that 12% of Sanders\u2019 primary voters eventually voted for Trump. Then workers, including 43% of union members, voted in 2016 for Trump, who never delivered any genuine relief to working people. On the contrary, his administration acted against workers\u2019 interests. Despite campaign promises to take on companies that move jobs overseas, two years into his administration, Trump had already awarded over $115 billion in federal contracts to companies that offshored jobs.\n\nHow would labor fare under each of the respective presidential tickets?\n\nOrganized labor and all members of the working class would fare substantially better under a Kamala Harris presidency than another Trump presidency. Harris would maintain the support for bargaining, unionization rights and policies that expand justice for workers that President Biden championed, including paid leave, expanding the child tax credit and signing the Protecting the Right to Organize Act.\n\nHer choice for vice president, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, has supported and signed what\u2019s arguably the most pro-worker state legislation in the country. He promoted a broad pro-worker agenda that included giving workers up to six paid \u201csick and safe\u201d days a year; a $2.6 billion infrastructure bill; a law that creates a statewide \u201cstandards board\u201d to set minimum pay and benefits for nursing homes workers in the state; and much more.\n\nAlternatively, we have the anti-worker agenda of the Trump-Vance ticket, whose labor policies are explicitly laid out in the Heritage Foundation\u2019s \u201cMandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise, Project 2025.\u201d The section on labor is a blueprint on how to dismantle unions as an effective workplace and political representative of workers.",

        "text": "The Impact of the US Presidential Election on the Future of the International Order \u2022 Stimson Center\nEvery month, the Global South in the World Order Project convenes a meeting of experts from across the Global South to discuss key issues in international affairs that challenge conventional wisdom and inject non-Western perspectives and viewpoints into prominent policy debates in Washington. This publication is part of the Global South Experts Turn-the-Tables series, which highlights insights from select participants in these discussions.\nThis article addresses perspectives from Global South experts on how the upcoming U.S. presidential elections and the change in administrations may affect Global South countries. These experts do not expect a pivotal shift to occur in the United States\u2019 policies pertaining to the Global South. At the same time, a new U.S. administration has the opportunity to rectify Washington\u2019s past mistakes and to overcome ignorance of the Global South\u2019s autonomy and its efforts to improve the international order and bolster its own initiatives.\nThe 2024 U.S. presidential election is expected to have a major impact on the international community. The contours of Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 foreign policy are unclear; should former President Donald Trump be elected, foreign policy experts expect the United States to retrench from global governance and take a more nationalistic approach.\nScholars from across the Global South do not anticipate major changes in U.S. engagement with their countries, no matter who is elected, in light of the overall continuity in U.S. foreign policy during recent decades. Nonetheless, they see the U.S. election as a competition between pro-multilateralism and anti-multilateralism.\nWhile the United States is likely to continue to focus its efforts on countering China and fostering a Manichean view of the world, \u201cWest vs. East,\u201d \u201cdemocracy vs. autocracy,\u201d many in the Global South view the division in the world rather as being along the lines of \u201cGlobal North vs. Global South.\u201d this view is based on the longstanding and entrenched global inequalities and inequity that continue to create a wedge between Western powers on the one hand and the Majority World on the other.1The term \u201cMajority World\u201d is a reminder that the average income levels of those living in the West represent the income levels of a minority of people worldwide.\u00a0 According to the World Bank, 80% of the world\u2019s population lives on $10 or less per day.\nHistorically, the Global North has aggressively suppressed initiatives from the Global South that aimed to create a more balanced and equitable international system. Many in the Global South see little difference between Trump and President Joe Biden regarding substantive support for their issues, viewing the moves of both administrations as largely rhetorical and symbolic.\nIn this context, many Global South political and thought leaders no longer rely on the United States to reform global governance. Rather, they seek new partnerships and alternative multilateral forums that can help them advance their interests and secure international development and climate financing. Contrary to convention wisdom in the West, these actors seek to advance universalism of international norms, in contrast to the US-led \u201crules-based order,\u201d which a minority imposes on the majority while often ignoring these rules when they apply to their behavior.\nThis dynamic, rooted in colonial history, highlights the need for an equitable system that genuinelyincorporates the perspectives and aspirations of Global South states.\nKarim Makdisi, Associate Professor of International Politics, The American University of Beirut\nFor much of the Global South, U.S. foreign policy and its shaping of the modern international order has been marked by double standards and continuity ensuring Western dominance by any means, regardless of who is president. At the heart of this dominance is what the U.S. establishment calls the \u201crules-based order,\u201d which, as the South African scholar John Dugard has argued, is in effect an amorphous and \u201ctacit agreement\u201d that \u201cbest advances the interests of the West, a chimera, meaning whatever the [United States] and its followers want it to mean at any given time.\u201d The United States\u2019 rules-based order contrasts with an alternative order based on international law and the United Nations charter, which the Global South has long struggled over many decades to make more universal and equitable.\nThe Global South understands well the double standards and opaque criteria inherent in the United States\u2019 rules-based order. It observes, for example, how the United States conveniently invokes international law to de-legitimize Russia\u2019s unlawful invasion of Ukraine, and then intentionally undermines or attacks the same laws when defending Israel\u2019s assorted invasions, occupations and war crimes. As one senior G7 diplomat told the Financial Times, the West\u2019s support for Israel\u2019s assault on Gaza means \u201cWe have definitely lost the battle in the Global South\u2026All the work we have done with the Global South [over Ukraine] has been lost\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Forget about rules, forget about world order. They won\u2019t ever listen to us again.\u201d\nViewed from the Middle East, the continuity of U.S. dominance over the international system through the rules-based order has long rested on uncritical bipartisan support for Israel, no matter the cost to U.S. standing and international law, and control over Gulf oil resources. Protecting Israel and oil resources has traditionally seen U.S. leaders actively back and arm authoritarian governments in the region and consistently prosecute \u201cforever wars\u201d to impose U.S. hegemony and ensure enormous profits for U.S. corporations. Successive U.S. administrations have helped suppress popular sentiment and movements across the region and attack international law provisions and institutions when they get in the way of purported U.S. interests.\nSeen in this historical and bipartisan context, it is easy to understand why the administration of President Joe Biden shifted so seamlessly from moralistic rhetoric about human rights to appeasing and selling arms to authoritarian Arab governments \u2014 just as the Trump administration did. This administration has moved from calling for Middle East peace to actively enabling Israel\u2019s horrific war on Gaza, defunding the UN agency that supports desperate Palestinian refugees \u2015 as the Trump administration also did \u2015 and attacking the landmark International Court of Justice cases against Israel and threatening the International Criminal Court (which the Trump administration also did). As a result, the United States is now seen by many in the Arab world as the as the biggest threat to stability and security, with a near consensus of 94% of the Arab world disapproving of Biden\u2019s staunch defense and arming of the most right-wing, extremist government in Israeli history during its mass violence in Gaza.\nIn this sense, Trump\u2019s anti-multilateralist \u201cAmerica First\u201d rhetoric and Biden\u2019s (and Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019) ostensibly pro-multilateralist \u201cAmerica is back\u201d slogan are not seen as so different in the Middle East and Global South. Both Republican and Democratic parties have attacked international law and institutions (and their representatives) when they have not aligned with purported U.S. interests. There is no reason to believe that the 2024 presidential election will fundamentally change this approach or challenge this long continuity in U.S. policy, particularly if Trump wins. Harris, at least, may adjust U.S. rhetoric and even policy on the margins as she understands that Biden\u2019s extreme pro-Israel position is one reason why he was projected to lose to Trump, given how deeply unpopular Biden\u2019s Gaza policy is domestically with young voters. Could a Harris win somehow better align the capricious U.S. rules-based order with the more universal order based around international law that is championed by the Global South? To do so requires the United States to fundamentally change its policy in the Middle East.\nChris O. \u00d2g\u00fanm\u1ecd\u0301d\u1eb9d\u00e9, Editor at The Republic\nAfrica\u2019s decades-long clamor for reform of key global governance institutions has reached a crescendo in recent years. Last year, the African Union joined the G-20 as a permanent member, and South Africa is set to assume control of the forum\u2019s presidency later this year. African states have stepped up their demands for their bloc to get at least two permanent seats on the UN Security Council with veto powers, as well as five non-permanent seats. Amid rising debt burdens, a rapidly escalating climate emergency and stalled progress toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, a multiplicity of voices on the continent has proposed steps to transform the global financial architecture.\nBiden\u2019s pledge to support efforts to reform the U.N. and other international organizations did not come to fruition. But the next U.S. administration can and should champion this endeavor. Although the conventional wisdom in some quarters is that the presumptive front-runners in the 2024 U.S. presidential election \u2014 Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump \u2014 represent contrasting visions of multilateralism, this understates the bipartisan commitment in Washington to the use of international institutions to advance U.S. geopolitical interests. For many nations and populations in the Global South, the distinction between Democratic and Republican administrations is decidedly nil.\nNonetheless, African voices \u2014 governments, private sector organizations, civil society groups, and the like \u2014 need to continue building bridges with their peers in Global Majority countries to achieve valuable reforms in the global governance order. Several proposals laid out in the Sal Declaration and by the African High-Level Working Group on the Global Financial Architecture have found support in some European circles and could be built upon. At a time when the United States seeks to convince African nations that it can be trusted as an international partner, supporting the continent\u2019s immediate and long-term development aspirations would be a tangible way to build lasting support beyond a presidential term.\nShuva Raha, Fellow and International Cooperation Lead at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water\nIn a June 2020 Stimson Issue Brief, Multilateralism for Chronic Risks, written amidst the raging COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. Arunabha Ghosh, Founder-CEO of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), one of Asia\u2019s leading think tanks, wrote that a \u201cperfect storm of shocks\u201d \u2014 \u201ca series of environmental, economic, and social crises\u201d \u2014 could cripple even the mightiest militaries and economies, and undo decades of progress in less developed countries. During such existential crises, he noted, \u201ccountries impulsively turn inwards\u201d and the world must deal with \u201cde minimis multilateralism: what is the minimum on which interests converge?\u201d\nAmidst the pandemic, which was decimating lives, livelihoods, and national economies, in February 2022, the simmering Russia-Ukraine conflict escalated into war. The US-NATO\u2013led defense of Ukraine further polarized the world with its \u201cwith-us-or-against-us\u201d demand for condemnations and sanctions against Russia. India followed its independent foreign policy and, despite its warming relations with the United States during both Republican and Democratic administrations, called for cessation of hostilities \u2014 without taking sides. Similar stances by many countries reflect their growing \u2014 and unifying \u2014 aversion toward being coerced into chaos while they focus on their own priorities.\nNow, in 2024, the world is truly in de minimis multilateralism. At least 97 countries, with ~2 billion voters, have elections this year. Many have yielded surprising results; the focus now is on the U.S. Presidential race in November, mired in controversies. Worldwide, speculation is rife about how party ideologies would shape U.S. foreign policy, and how domestic imperatives could overwhelm diplomatic acumen.\nMeanwhile, countries are instituting unlikely yet strategic mini-laterals, forging new trade and currency connections, and adopting novel technologies and media strategies. New leaders are emerging: China, with its aggressive policies; Russia, driven by its isolation by the West; diplomacy-oriented India, which in 2023 led the G-20 \u2014 including the United States, European Union, Russia and China, to a wide-ranging, unanimous Leaders\u2019 Declaration; and many regional powerhouses.\nDr Ghosh notes that post-World-War-II multilateralism banked largely on the economic reliance of countries on the United States, \u201cwhose individual state objectives aligned with global ones at the time: financial stability, freer trade, and global development\u2026 these conditions no longer seem to apply.\u201d And, there is an urgent global demand to reform these 1944 Bretton Woods institutions \u2014 the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank \u2014 and governance systems to transparently and equitably serve the modern, multipolar world.\nTherefore, the United States should redefine its leadership role in today\u2019s context: yesterday\u2019s conflict will need to yield to collaborative efforts for tomorrow. Moreover, Washington should transact with allies and partners with trust and respect. It should see the world beyond U.S. borders as a multilateral tapestry to be rewoven, with new co-weavers, new threads, and a brand new design.\nCopyright The Henry L.

from across the Global South to discuss key issues in international affairs that challenge conventional wisdom and inject non-Western perspectives and viewpoints into prominent policy debates in Washington. This publication is part of the Global South Experts Turn-the-Tables series, which highlights insights from select participants in these discussions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article addresses perspectives from Global South experts on how the upcoming U.S. presidential elections and the change in administrations may affect Global South countries. These experts do not expect a pivotal shift to occur in the United States\u2019 policies pertaining to the Global South. At the same time, a new U.S. administration has the opportunity to rectify Washington\u2019s past mistakes and to overcome ignorance of the Global South\u2019s autonomy and its efforts to improve the international order and bolster its own initiatives.\nThe 2024 U.S. presidential election is expected to have a major impact on the international community. The contours of Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 foreign policy are unclear; should former President Donald Trump be elected, foreign policy experts expect the United States to retrench from global governance and take a more nationalistic approach.\nScholars from across the Global South do not anticipate major changes in U.S. engagement with their countries, no matter who is elected, in light of the overall continuity in U.S. foreign policy during recent decades. Nonetheless, they see the U.S. election as a competition between pro-multilateralism and anti-multilateralism.\nWhile the United States is likely to continue to focus its efforts on countering China and fostering a Manichean view of the world, \u201cWest vs. East,\u201d \u201cdemocracy vs. autocracy,\u201d many in the Global South view the division in the world rather as being along the lines of \u201cGlobal North vs. Global South.\u201d this view is based on the longstanding and entrenched global inequalities and inequity that continue to create a wedge between Western powers on the one hand and the Majority World on the other.1The term \u201cMajority World\u201d is a reminder that the average income levels of those living in the West represent the income levels of a minority of people worldwide.\u00a0 According to the World Bank, 80% of the world\u2019s population lives on $10 or less per day.\nHistorically, the Global North has aggressively suppressed initiatives from the Global South that aimed to create a more balanced and equitable international system. Many in the Global South see little difference between Trump and President Joe Biden regarding substantive support for their issues, viewing the moves of both administrations as largely rhetorical and symbolic.\nIn this context, many Global South political and thought leaders no longer rely on the United States to reform global governance. Rather, they seek new partnerships and alternative multilateral forums that can help them advance their interests and secure international development and climate financing. Contrary to convention wisdom in the West, these actors seek to advance universalism of international norms, in contrast to the US-led \u201crules-based order,\u201d which a minority imposes on the majority while often ignoring these rules when they apply to their behavior.\nThis dynamic, rooted in colonial history, highlights the need for an equitable system that genuinelyincorporates the perspectives and aspirations of Global South states.\nThe United States Must Change its Foreign Policy in the Middle East or it will lose the Global South (Again)\nKarim Makdisi, Associate Professor of International Politics, The American University of Beirut\nFor much of the Global South, U.S. foreign policy and its shaping of the modern international order has been marked by double standards and continuity ensuring Western dominance by any means, regardless of who is president. At the heart of this dominance is what the U.S. establishment calls the \u201crules-based order,\u201d which, as the South African scholar John Dugard has argued, is in effect an amorphous and \u201ctacit agreement\u201d that \u201cbest advances the interests of the West, a chimera, meaning whatever the [United States] and its followers want it to mean at any given time.\u201d The United States\u2019 rules-based order contrasts with an alternative order based on international law and the United Nations charter, which the Global South has long struggled over many decades to make more universal and equitable.\nThe Global South understands well the double standards and opaque criteria inherent in the United States\u2019 rules-based order. It observes, for example, how the United States conveniently invokes international law to de-legitimize Russia\u2019s unlawful invasion of Ukraine, and then intentionally undermines or attacks the same laws when defending Israel\u2019s assorted invasions, occupations and war crimes. As one senior G7 diplomat told the Financial Times, the West\u2019s support for Israel\u2019s assault on Gaza means \u201cWe have definitely lost the battle in the Global South\u2026All the work we have done with the Global South [over Ukraine] has been lost\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Forget about rules, forget about world order. They won\u2019t ever listen to us again.\u201d\nViewed from the Middle East, the continuity of U.S. dominance over the international system through the rules-based order has long rested on uncritical bipartisan support for Israel, no matter the cost to U.S. standing and international law, and control over Gulf oil resources. Protecting Israel and oil resources has traditionally seen U.S. leaders actively back and arm authoritarian governments in the region and consistently prosecute \u201cforever wars\u201d to impose U.S. hegemony and ensure enormous profits for U.S. corporations. Successive U.S. administrations have helped suppress popular sentiment and movements across the region and attack international law provisions and institutions when they get in the way of purported U.S. interests.\nSeen in this historical and bipartisan context, it is easy to understand why the administration of President Joe Biden shifted so seamlessly from moralistic rhetoric about human rights to appeasing and selling arms to authoritarian Arab governments \u2014 just as the Trump administration did. This administration has moved from calling for Middle East peace to actively enabling Israel\u2019s horrific war on Gaza, defunding the UN agency that supports desperate Palestinian refugees \u2015 as the Trump administration also did \u2015 and attacking the landmark International Court of Justice cases against Israel and threatening the International Criminal Court (which the Trump administration also did). As a result, the United States is now seen by many in the Arab world as the as the biggest threat to stability and security, with a near consensus of 94% of the Arab world disapproving of Biden\u2019s staunch defense and arming of the most right-wing, extremist government in Israeli history during its mass violence in Gaza.\u00a0\nIn this sense, Trump\u2019s anti-multilateralist \u201cAmerica First\u201d rhetoric and Biden\u2019s (and Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019) ostensibly pro-multilateralist \u201cAmerica is back\u201d slogan are not seen as so different in the Middle East and Global South. Both Republican and Democratic parties have attacked international law and institutions (and their representatives) when they have not aligned with purported U.S. interests. There is no reason to believe that the 2024 presidential election will fundamentally change this approach or challenge this long continuity in U.S. policy, particularly if Trump wins. Harris, at least, may adjust U.S. rhetoric and even policy on the margins as she understands that Biden\u2019s extreme pro-Israel position is one reason why he was projected to lose to Trump, given how deeply unpopular Biden\u2019s Gaza policy is domestically with young voters. Could a Harris win somehow better align the capricious U.S. rules-based order with the more universal order based around international law that is championed by the Global South? To do so requires the United States to fundamentally change its policy in the Middle East.\nHow Do US Election Outcomes Impact Africa?\nChris O. \u00d2g\u00fanm\u1ecd\u0301d\u1eb9d\u00e9, Editor at The Republic\nAfrica\u2019s decades-long clamor for reform of key global governance institutions has reached a crescendo in recent years. Last year, the African Union joined the G-20 as a permanent member, and South Africa is set to assume control of the forum\u2019s presidency later this year. African states have stepped up their demands for their bloc to get at least two permanent seats on the UN Security Council with veto powers, as well as five non-permanent seats. Amid rising debt burdens, a rapidly escalating climate emergency and stalled progress toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, a multiplicity of voices on the continent has proposed steps to transform the global financial architecture.\nBiden\u2019s pledge to support efforts to reform the U.N. and other international organizations did not come to fruition. But the next U.S. administration can and should champion this endeavor. Although the conventional wisdom in some quarters is that the presumptive front-runners in the 2024 U.S. presidential election \u2014 Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump \u2014 represent contrasting visions of multilateralism, this understates the bipartisan commitment in Washington to the use of international institutions to advance U.S. geopolitical interests. For many nations and populations in the Global South, the distinction between Democratic and Republican administrations is decidedly nil.\nNonetheless, African voices \u2014 governments, private sector organizations, civil society groups, and the like \u2014 need to continue building bridges with their peers in Global Majority countries to achieve valuable reforms in the global governance order. Several proposals laid out in the Sal Declaration and by the African High-Level Working Group on the Global Financial Architecture have found support in some European circles and could be built upon. At a time when the United States seeks to convince African nations that it can be trusted as an international partner, supporting the continent\u2019s immediate and long-term development aspirations would be a tangible way to build lasting support beyond a presidential term.\nTransacting with Trust\nShuva Raha, Fellow and International Cooperation Lead at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water\nIn a June 2020 Stimson Issue Brief, Multilateralism for Chronic Risks, written amidst the raging COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. Arunabha Ghosh, Founder-CEO of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), one of Asia\u2019s leading think tanks, wrote that a \u201cperfect storm of shocks\u201d \u2014 \u201ca series of environmental, economic, and social crises\u201d \u2014 could cripple even the mightiest militaries and economies, and undo decades of progress in less developed countries. During such existential crises, he noted, \u201ccountries impulsively turn inwards\u201d and the world must deal with \u201cde minimis multilateralism: what is the minimum on which interests converge?\u201d\nAmidst the pandemic, which was decimating lives, livelihoods, and national economies, in February 2022, the simmering Russia-Ukraine conflict escalated into war. The US-NATO\u2013led defense of Ukraine further polarized the world with its \u201cwith-us-or-against-us\u201d demand for condemnations and sanctions against Russia. India followed its independent foreign policy and, despite its warming relations with the United States during both Republican and Democratic administrations, called for cessation of hostilities \u2014 without taking sides. Similar stances by many countries reflect their growing \u2014 and unifying \u2014 aversion toward being coerced into chaos while they focus on their own priorities.\nNow, in 2024, the world is truly in de minimis multilateralism. At least 97 countries, with ~2 billion voters, have elections this year. Many have yielded surprising results; the focus now is on the U.S. Presidential race in November, mired in controversies. Worldwide, speculation is rife about how party ideologies would shape U.S. foreign policy, and how domestic imperatives could overwhelm diplomatic acumen.\nMeanwhile, countries are instituting unlikely yet strategic mini-laterals, forging new trade and currency connections, and adopting novel technologies and media strategies. New leaders are emerging: China, with its aggressive policies; Russia, driven by its isolation by the West; diplomacy-oriented India, which in 2023 led the G-20 \u2014 including the United States, European Union, Russia and China, to a wide-ranging, unanimous Leaders\u2019 Declaration; and many regional powerhouses.\nDr Ghosh notes that post-World-War-II multilateralism banked largely on the economic reliance of countries on the United States, \u201cwhose individual state objectives aligned with global ones at the time: financial stability, freer trade, and global development\u2026 these conditions no longer seem to apply.\u201d And, there is an urgent global demand to reform these 1944 Bretton Woods institutions \u2014 the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank \u2014 and governance systems to transparently and equitably serve the modern, multipolar world.\nTherefore, the United States should redefine its leadership role in today\u2019s context: yesterday\u2019s conflict will need to yield to collaborative efforts for tomorrow. Moreover, Washington should transact with allies and partners with trust and respect. It should see the world beyond U.S. borders as a multilateral tapestry to be rewoven, with new co-weavers, new threads, and a brand new design.\nNotes1The term \u201cMajority World\u201d is a reminder that the average income levels of those living in the West represent the income levels of a minority of people worldwide.\u00a0 According to the World Bank, 80% of the world\u2019s population lives on $10 or less per day. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent & Related \n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy Memo \n\n\n\nPrioritize Substance Over Symbolism in the U.S.-Taiwan Relationship \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n      \n      Pamela Kennedy\n\t\t\n\t \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy Memo \n\n\n\nBiden\u2019s Foreign Policy Legacy: A Troubled Interregnum \n\n\n\n\n\t\n      \n\t  Robert A.

the World Order Project convenes a meeting of experts from across the Global South to discuss key issues in international affairs that challenge conventional wisdom and inject non-Western perspectives and viewpoints into prominent policy debates in Washington. This publication is part of the Global South Experts Turn-the-Tables series, which highlights insights from select participants in these discussions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article addresses perspectives from Global South experts on how the upcoming U.S. presidential elections and the change in administrations may affect Global South countries. These experts do not expect a pivotal shift to occur in the United States\u2019 policies pertaining to the Global South. At the same time, a new U.S. administration has the opportunity to rectify Washington\u2019s past mistakes and to overcome ignorance of the Global South\u2019s autonomy and its efforts to improve the international order and bolster its own initiatives.\nThe 2024 U.S. presidential election is expected to have a major impact on the international community. The contours of Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 foreign policy are unclear; should former President Donald Trump be elected, foreign policy experts expect the United States to retrench from global governance and take a more nationalistic approach.\nScholars from across the Global South do not anticipate major changes in U.S. engagement with their countries, no matter who is elected, in light of the overall continuity in U.S. foreign policy during recent decades. Nonetheless, they see the U.S. election as a competition between pro-multilateralism and anti-multilateralism.\nWhile the United States is likely to continue to focus its efforts on countering China and fostering a Manichean view of the world, \u201cWest vs. East,\u201d \u201cdemocracy vs. autocracy,\u201d many in the Global South view the division in the world rather as being along the lines of \u201cGlobal North vs. Global South.\u201d this view is based on the longstanding and entrenched global inequalities and inequity that continue to create a wedge between Western powers on the one hand and the Majority World on the other.1The term \u201cMajority World\u201d is a reminder that the average income levels of those living in the West represent the income levels of a minority of people worldwide.\u00a0 According to the World Bank, 80% of the world\u2019s population lives on $10 or less per day.\nHistorically, the Global North has aggressively suppressed initiatives from the Global South that aimed to create a more balanced and equitable international system. Many in the Global South see little difference between Trump and President Joe Biden regarding substantive support for their issues, viewing the moves of both administrations as largely rhetorical and symbolic.\nIn this context, many Global South political and thought leaders no longer rely on the United States to reform global governance. Rather, they seek new partnerships and alternative multilateral forums that can help them advance their interests and secure international development and climate financing. Contrary to convention wisdom in the West, these actors seek to advance universalism of international norms, in contrast to the US-led \u201crules-based order,\u201d which a minority imposes on the majority while often ignoring these rules when they apply to their behavior.\nThis dynamic, rooted in colonial history, highlights the need for an equitable system that genuinelyincorporates the perspectives and aspirations of Global South states.\nThe United States Must Change its Foreign Policy in the Middle East or it will lose the Global South (Again)\nKarim Makdisi, Associate Professor of International Politics, The American University of Beirut\nFor much of the Global South, U.S. foreign policy and its shaping of the modern international order has been marked by double standards and continuity ensuring Western dominance by any means, regardless of who is president. At the heart of this dominance is what the U.S. establishment calls the \u201crules-based order,\u201d which, as the South African scholar John Dugard has argued, is in effect an amorphous and \u201ctacit agreement\u201d that \u201cbest advances the interests of the West, a chimera, meaning whatever the [United States] and its followers want it to mean at any given time.\u201d The United States\u2019 rules-based order contrasts with an alternative order based on international law and the United Nations charter, which the Global South has long struggled over many decades to make more universal and equitable.\nThe Global South understands well the double standards and opaque criteria inherent in the United States\u2019 rules-based order. It observes, for example, how the United States conveniently invokes international law to de-legitimize Russia\u2019s unlawful invasion of Ukraine, and then intentionally undermines or attacks the same laws when defending Israel\u2019s assorted invasions, occupations and war crimes. As one senior G7 diplomat told the Financial Times, the West\u2019s support for Israel\u2019s assault on Gaza means \u201cWe have definitely lost the battle in the Global South\u2026All the work we have done with the Global South [over Ukraine] has been lost\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Forget about rules, forget about world order. They won\u2019t ever listen to us again.\u201d\nViewed from the Middle East, the continuity of U.S. dominance over the international system through the rules-based order has long rested on uncritical bipartisan support for Israel, no matter the cost to U.S. standing and international law, and control over Gulf oil resources. Protecting Israel and oil resources has traditionally seen U.S. leaders actively back and arm authoritarian governments in the region and consistently prosecute \u201cforever wars\u201d to impose U.S. hegemony and ensure enormous profits for U.S. corporations. Successive U.S. administrations have helped suppress popular sentiment and movements across the region and attack international law provisions and institutions when they get in the way of purported U.S. interests.\nSeen in this historical and bipartisan context, it is easy to understand why the administration of President Joe Biden shifted so seamlessly from moralistic rhetoric about human rights to appeasing and selling arms to authoritarian Arab governments \u2014 just as the Trump administration did. This administration has moved from calling for Middle East peace to actively enabling Israel\u2019s horrific war on Gaza, defunding the UN agency that supports desperate Palestinian refugees \u2015 as the Trump administration also did \u2015 and attacking the landmark International Court of Justice cases against Israel and threatening the International Criminal Court (which the Trump administration also did). As a result, the United States is now seen by many in the Arab world as the as the biggest threat to stability and security, with a near consensus of 94% of the Arab world disapproving of Biden\u2019s staunch defense and arming of the most right-wing, extremist government in Israeli history during its mass violence in Gaza.\u00a0\nIn this sense, Trump\u2019s anti-multilateralist \u201cAmerica First\u201d rhetoric and Biden\u2019s (and Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019) ostensibly pro-multilateralist \u201cAmerica is back\u201d slogan are not seen as so different in the Middle East and Global South. Both Republican and Democratic parties have attacked international law and institutions (and their representatives) when they have not aligned with purported U.S. interests. There is no reason to believe that the 2024 presidential election will fundamentally change this approach or challenge this long continuity in U.S. policy, particularly if Trump wins. Harris, at least, may adjust U.S. rhetoric and even policy on the margins as she understands that Biden\u2019s extreme pro-Israel position is one reason why he was projected to lose to Trump, given how deeply unpopular Biden\u2019s Gaza policy is domestically with young voters. Could a Harris win somehow better align the capricious U.S. rules-based order with the more universal order based around international law that is championed by the Global South? To do so requires the United States to fundamentally change its policy in the Middle East.\nHow Do US Election Outcomes Impact Africa?\nChris O. \u00d2g\u00fanm\u1ecd\u0301d\u1eb9d\u00e9, Editor at The Republic\nAfrica\u2019s decades-long clamor for reform of key global governance institutions has reached a crescendo in recent years. Last year, the African Union joined the G-20 as a permanent member, and South Africa is set to assume control of the forum\u2019s presidency later this year. African states have stepped up their demands for their bloc to get at least two permanent seats on the UN Security Council with veto powers, as well as five non-permanent seats. Amid rising debt burdens, a rapidly escalating climate emergency and stalled progress toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, a multiplicity of voices on the continent has proposed steps to transform the global financial architecture.\nBiden\u2019s pledge to support efforts to reform the U.N. and other international organizations did not come to fruition. But the next U.S. administration can and should champion this endeavor. Although the conventional wisdom in some quarters is that the presumptive front-runners in the 2024 U.S. presidential election \u2014 Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump \u2014 represent contrasting visions of multilateralism, this understates the bipartisan commitment in Washington to the use of international institutions to advance U.S. geopolitical interests. For many nations and populations in the Global South, the distinction between Democratic and Republican administrations is decidedly nil.\nNonetheless, African voices \u2014 governments, private sector organizations, civil society groups, and the like \u2014 need to continue building bridges with their peers in Global Majority countries to achieve valuable reforms in the global governance order. Several proposals laid out in the Sal Declaration and by the African High-Level Working Group on the Global Financial Architecture have found support in some European circles and could be built upon. At a time when the United States seeks to convince African nations that it can be trusted as an international partner, supporting the continent\u2019s immediate and long-term development aspirations would be a tangible way to build lasting support beyond a presidential term.\nTransacting with Trust\nShuva Raha, Fellow and International Cooperation Lead at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water\nIn a June 2020 Stimson Issue Brief, Multilateralism for Chronic Risks, written amidst the raging COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. Arunabha Ghosh, Founder-CEO of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), one of Asia\u2019s leading think tanks, wrote that a \u201cperfect storm of shocks\u201d \u2014 \u201ca series of environmental, economic, and social crises\u201d \u2014 could cripple even the mightiest militaries and economies, and undo decades of progress in less developed countries. During such existential crises, he noted, \u201ccountries impulsively turn inwards\u201d and the world must deal with \u201cde minimis multilateralism: what is the minimum on which interests converge?\u201d\nAmidst the pandemic, which was decimating lives, livelihoods, and national economies, in February 2022, the simmering Russia-Ukraine conflict escalated into war. The US-NATO\u2013led defense of Ukraine further polarized the world with its \u201cwith-us-or-against-us\u201d demand for condemnations and sanctions against Russia. India followed its independent foreign policy and, despite its warming relations with the United States during both Republican and Democratic administrations, called for cessation of hostilities \u2014 without taking sides. Similar stances by many countries reflect their growing \u2014 and unifying \u2014 aversion toward being coerced into chaos while they focus on their own priorities.\nNow, in 2024, the world is truly in de minimis multilateralism. At least 97 countries, with ~2 billion voters, have elections this year. Many have yielded surprising results; the focus now is on the U.S. Presidential race in November, mired in controversies. Worldwide, speculation is rife about how party ideologies would shape U.S. foreign policy, and how domestic imperatives could overwhelm diplomatic acumen.\nMeanwhile, countries are instituting unlikely yet strategic mini-laterals, forging new trade and currency connections, and adopting novel technologies and media strategies. New leaders are emerging: China, with its aggressive policies; Russia, driven by its isolation by the West; diplomacy-oriented India, which in 2023 led the G-20 \u2014 including the United States, European Union, Russia and China, to a wide-ranging, unanimous Leaders\u2019 Declaration; and many regional powerhouses.\nDr Ghosh notes that post-World-War-II multilateralism banked largely on the economic reliance of countries on the United States, \u201cwhose individual state objectives aligned with global ones at the time: financial stability, freer trade, and global development\u2026 these conditions no longer seem to apply.\u201d And, there is an urgent global demand to reform these 1944 Bretton Woods institutions \u2014 the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank \u2014 and governance systems to transparently and equitably serve the modern, multipolar world.\nTherefore, the United States should redefine its leadership role in today\u2019s context: yesterday\u2019s conflict will need to yield to collaborative efforts for tomorrow. Moreover, Washington should transact with allies and partners with trust and respect. It should see the world beyond U.S. borders as a multilateral tapestry to be rewoven, with new co-weavers, new threads, and a brand new design.\nNotes1The term \u201cMajority World\u201d is a reminder that the average income levels of those living in the West represent the income levels of a minority of people worldwide.\u00a0 According to the World Bank, 80% of the world\u2019s population lives on $10 or less per day.\nEvery month, the Global South in the World Order Project convenes a meeting of experts from across the Global South to discuss key issues in international affairs that challenge conventional wisdom and inject non-Western perspectives and viewpoints into prominent policy debates in Washington.

Nonetheless, they see the U.S. election as a competition between pro-multilateralism and anti-multilateralism.\nWhile the United States is likely to continue to focus its efforts on countering China and fostering a Manichean view of the world, \u201cWest vs. East,\u201d \u201cdemocracy vs. autocracy,\u201d many in the Global South view the division in the world rather as being along the lines of \u201cGlobal North vs. Global South.\u201d this view is based on the longstanding and entrenched global inequalities and inequity that continue to create a wedge between Western powers on the one hand and the Majority World on the other.1The term \u201cMajority World\u201d is a reminder that the average income levels of those living in the West represent the income levels of a minority of people worldwide.\u00a0 According to the World Bank, 80% of the world\u2019s population lives on $10 or less per day.\nHistorically, the Global North has aggressively suppressed initiatives from the Global South that aimed to create a more balanced and equitable international system. Many in the Global South see little difference between Trump and President Joe Biden regarding substantive support for their issues, viewing the moves of both administrations as largely rhetorical and symbolic.\nIn this context, many Global South political and thought leaders no longer rely on the United States to reform global governance. Rather, they seek new partnerships and alternative multilateral forums that can help them advance their interests and secure international development and climate financing. Contrary to convention wisdom in the West, these actors seek to advance universalism of international norms, in contrast to the US-led \u201crules-based order,\u201d which a minority imposes on the majority while often ignoring these rules when they apply to their behavior.\nThis dynamic, rooted in colonial history, highlights the need for an equitable system that genuinelyincorporates the perspectives and aspirations of Global South states.\nThe United States Must Change its Foreign Policy in the Middle East or it will lose the Global South (Again)\nKarim Makdisi, Associate Professor of International Politics, The American University of Beirut\nFor much of the Global South, U.S. foreign policy and its shaping of the modern international order has been marked by double standards and continuity ensuring Western dominance by any means, regardless of who is president. At the heart of this dominance is what the U.S. establishment calls the \u201crules-based order,\u201d which, as the South African scholar John Dugard has argued, is in effect an amorphous and \u201ctacit agreement\u201d that \u201cbest advances the interests of the West, a chimera, meaning whatever the [United States] and its followers want it to mean at any given time.\u201d The United States\u2019 rules-based order contrasts with an alternative order based on international law and the United Nations charter, which the Global South has long struggled over many decades to make more universal and equitable.\nThe Global South understands well the double standards and opaque criteria inherent in the United States\u2019 rules-based order. It observes, for example, how the United States conveniently invokes international law to de-legitimize Russia\u2019s unlawful invasion of Ukraine, and then intentionally undermines or attacks the same laws when defending Israel\u2019s assorted invasions, occupations and war crimes. As one senior G7 diplomat told the Financial Times, the West\u2019s support for Israel\u2019s assault on Gaza means \u201cWe have definitely lost the battle in the Global South\u2026All the work we have done with the Global South [over Ukraine] has been lost\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Forget about rules, forget about world order. They won\u2019t ever listen to us again.\u201d\nViewed from the Middle East, the continuity of U.S. dominance over the international system through the rules-based order has long rested on uncritical bipartisan support for Israel, no matter the cost to U.S. standing and international law, and control over Gulf oil resources. Protecting Israel and oil resources has traditionally seen U.S. leaders actively back and arm authoritarian governments in the region and consistently prosecute \u201cforever wars\u201d to impose U.S. hegemony and ensure enormous profits for U.S. corporations. Successive U.S. administrations have helped suppress popular sentiment and movements across the region and attack international law provisions and institutions when they get in the way of purported U.S. interests.\nSeen in this historical and bipartisan context, it is easy to understand why the administration of President Joe Biden shifted so seamlessly from moralistic rhetoric about human rights to appeasing and selling arms to authoritarian Arab governments \u2014 just as the Trump administration did. This administration has moved from calling for Middle East peace to actively enabling Israel\u2019s horrific war on Gaza, defunding the UN agency that supports desperate Palestinian refugees \u2015 as the Trump administration also did \u2015 and attacking the landmark International Court of Justice cases against Israel and threatening the International Criminal Court (which the Trump administration also did). As a result, the United States is now seen by many in the Arab world as the as the biggest threat to stability and security, with a near consensus of 94% of the Arab world disapproving of Biden\u2019s staunch defense and arming of the most right-wing, extremist government in Israeli history during its mass violence in Gaza.\u00a0\nIn this sense, Trump\u2019s anti-multilateralist \u201cAmerica First\u201d rhetoric and Biden\u2019s (and Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019) ostensibly pro-multilateralist \u201cAmerica is back\u201d slogan are not seen as so different in the Middle East and Global South. Both Republican and Democratic parties have attacked international law and institutions (and their representatives) when they have not aligned with purported U.S. interests. There is no reason to believe that the 2024 presidential election will fundamentally change this approach or challenge this long continuity in U.S. policy, particularly if Trump wins. Harris, at least, may adjust U.S. rhetoric and even policy on the margins as she understands that Biden\u2019s extreme pro-Israel position is one reason why he was projected to lose to Trump, given how deeply unpopular Biden\u2019s Gaza policy is domestically with young voters. Could a Harris win somehow better align the capricious U.S. rules-based order with the more universal order based around international law that is championed by the Global South? To do so requires the United States to fundamentally change its policy in the Middle East.\nHow Do US Election Outcomes Impact Africa?\nChris O. \u00d2g\u00fanm\u1ecd\u0301d\u1eb9d\u00e9, Editor at The Republic\nAfrica\u2019s decades-long clamor for reform of key global governance institutions has reached a crescendo in recent years. Last year, the African Union joined the G-20 as a permanent member, and South Africa is set to assume control of the forum\u2019s presidency later this year. African states have stepped up their demands for their bloc to get at least two permanent seats on the UN Security Council with veto powers, as well as five non-permanent seats. Amid rising debt burdens, a rapidly escalating climate emergency and stalled progress toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, a multiplicity of voices on the continent has proposed steps to transform the global financial architecture.\nBiden\u2019s pledge to support efforts to reform the U.N. and other international organizations did not come to fruition. But the next U.S. administration can and should champion this endeavor. Although the conventional wisdom in some quarters is that the presumptive front-runners in the 2024 U.S. presidential election \u2014 Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump \u2014 represent contrasting visions of multilateralism, this understates the bipartisan commitment in Washington to the use of international institutions to advance U.S. geopolitical interests. For many nations and populations in the Global South, the distinction between Democratic and Republican administrations is decidedly nil.\nNonetheless, African voices \u2014 governments, private sector organizations, civil society groups, and the like \u2014 need to continue building bridges with their peers in Global Majority countries to achieve valuable reforms in the global governance order. Several proposals laid out in the Sal Declaration and by the African High-Level Working Group on the Global Financial Architecture have found support in some European circles and could be built upon. At a time when the United States seeks to convince African nations that it can be trusted as an international partner, supporting the continent\u2019s immediate and long-term development aspirations would be a tangible way to build lasting support beyond a presidential term.\nTransacting with Trust\nShuva Raha, Fellow and International Cooperation Lead at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water\nIn a June 2020 Stimson Issue Brief, Multilateralism for Chronic Risks, written amidst the raging COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. Arunabha Ghosh, Founder-CEO of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), one of Asia\u2019s leading think tanks, wrote that a \u201cperfect storm of shocks\u201d \u2014 \u201ca series of environmental, economic, and social crises\u201d \u2014 could cripple even the mightiest militaries and economies, and undo decades of progress in less developed countries. During such existential crises, he noted, \u201ccountries impulsively turn inwards\u201d and the world must deal with \u201cde minimis multilateralism: what is the minimum on which interests converge?\u201d\nAmidst the pandemic, which was decimating lives, livelihoods, and national economies, in February 2022, the simmering Russia-Ukraine conflict escalated into war. The US-NATO\u2013led defense of Ukraine further polarized the world with its \u201cwith-us-or-against-us\u201d demand for condemnations and sanctions against Russia. India followed its independent foreign policy and, despite its warming relations with the United States during both Republican and Democratic administrations, called for cessation of hostilities \u2014 without taking sides. Similar stances by many countries reflect their growing \u2014 and unifying \u2014 aversion toward being coerced into chaos while they focus on their own priorities.\nNow, in 2024, the world is truly in de minimis multilateralism. At least 97 countries, with ~2 billion voters, have elections this year. Many have yielded surprising results; the focus now is on the U.S. Presidential race in November, mired in controversies. Worldwide, speculation is rife about how party ideologies would shape U.S. foreign policy, and how domestic imperatives could overwhelm diplomatic acumen.\nMeanwhile, countries are instituting unlikely yet strategic mini-laterals, forging new trade and currency connections, and adopting novel technologies and media strategies. New leaders are emerging: China, with its aggressive policies; Russia, driven by its isolation by the West; diplomacy-oriented India, which in 2023 led the G-20 \u2014 including the United States, European Union, Russia and China, to a wide-ranging, unanimous Leaders\u2019 Declaration; and many regional powerhouses.\nDr Ghosh notes that post-World-War-II multilateralism banked largely on the economic reliance of countries on the United States, \u201cwhose individual state objectives aligned with global ones at the time: financial stability, freer trade, and global development\u2026 these conditions no longer seem to apply.\u201d And, there is an urgent global demand to reform these 1944 Bretton Woods institutions \u2014 the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank \u2014 and governance systems to transparently and equitably serve the modern, multipolar world.\nTherefore, the United States should redefine its leadership role in today\u2019s context: yesterday\u2019s conflict will need to yield to collaborative efforts for tomorrow. Moreover, Washington should transact with allies and partners with trust and respect. It should see the world beyond U.S. borders as a multilateral tapestry to be rewoven, with new co-weavers, new threads, and a brand new design.\nNotes1The term \u201cMajority World\u201d is a reminder that the average income levels of those living in the West represent the income levels of a minority of people worldwide.\u00a0 According to the World Bank, 80% of the world\u2019s population lives on $10 or less per day.\nEvery month, the Global South in the World Order Project convenes a meeting of experts from across the Global South to discuss key issues in international affairs that challenge conventional wisdom and inject non-Western perspectives and viewpoints into prominent policy debates in Washington.

Both Republican and Democratic parties have attacked international law and institutions (and their representatives) when they have not aligned with purported U.S. interests. There is no reason to believe that the 2024 presidential election will fundamentally change this approach or challenge this long continuity in U.S. policy, particularly if Trump wins. Harris, at least, may adjust U.S. rhetoric and even policy on the margins as she understands that Biden\u2019s extreme pro-Israel position is one reason why he was projected to lose to Trump, given how deeply unpopular Biden\u2019s Gaza policy is domestically with young voters. Could a Harris win somehow better align the capricious U.S. rules-based order with the more universal order based around international law that is championed by the Global South? To do so requires the United States to fundamentally change its policy in the Middle East.\nHow Do US Election Outcomes Impact Africa?\nChris O. \u00d2g\u00fanm\u1ecd\u0301d\u1eb9d\u00e9, Editor at The Republic\nAfrica\u2019s decades-long clamor for reform of key global governance institutions has reached a crescendo in recent years.

These experts do not expect a pivotal shift to occur in the United States\u2019 policies pertaining to the Global South. At the same time, a new U.S. administration has the opportunity to rectify Washington\u2019s past mistakes and to overcome ignorance of the Global South\u2019s autonomy and its efforts to improve the international order and bolster its own initiatives.\nThe 2024 U.S. presidential election is expected to have a major impact on the international community. The contours of Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 foreign policy are unclear; should former President Donald Trump be elected, foreign policy experts expect the United States to retrench from global governance and take a more nationalistic approach.\nScholars from across the Global South do not anticipate major changes in U.S. engagement with their countries, no matter who is elected, in light of the overall continuity in U.S. foreign policy during recent decades. Nonetheless, they see the U.S. election as a competition between pro-multilateralism and anti-multilateralism.\nWhile the United States is likely to continue to focus its efforts on countering China and fostering a Manichean view of the world, \u201cWest vs. East,\u201d \u201cdemocracy vs. autocracy,\u201d many in the Global South view the division in the world rather as being along the lines of \u201cGlobal North vs. Global South.\u201d this view is based on the longstanding and entrenched global inequalities and inequity that continue to create a wedge between Western powers on the one hand and the Majority World on the other.1The term \u201cMajority World\u201d is a reminder that the average income levels of those living in the West represent the income levels of a minority of people worldwide.\u00a0 According to the World Bank, 80% of the world\u2019s population lives on $10 or less per day.\nHistorically, the Global North has aggressively suppressed initiatives from the Global South that aimed to create a more balanced and equitable international system. Many in the Global South see little difference between Trump and President Joe Biden regarding substantive support for their issues, viewing the moves of both administrations as largely rhetorical and symbolic.\nIn this context, many Global South political and thought leaders no longer rely on the United States to reform global governance. Rather, they seek new partnerships and alternative multilateral forums that can help them advance their interests and secure international development and climate financing. Contrary to convention wisdom in the West, these actors seek to advance universalism of international norms, in contrast to the US-led \u201crules-based order,\u201d which a minority imposes on the majority while often ignoring these rules when they apply to their behavior.\nThis dynamic, rooted in colonial history, highlights the need for an equitable system that genuinelyincorporates the perspectives and aspirations of Global South states.\nThe United States Must Change its Foreign Policy in the Middle East or it will lose the Global South (Again)\nKarim Makdisi, Associate Professor of International Politics, The American University of Beirut\nFor much of the Global South, U.S. foreign policy and its shaping of the modern international order has been marked by double standards and continuity ensuring Western dominance by any means, regardless of who is president. At the heart of this dominance is what the U.S. establishment calls the \u201crules-based order,\u201d which, as the South African scholar John Dugard has argued, is in effect an amorphous and \u201ctacit agreement\u201d that \u201cbest advances the interests of the West, a chimera, meaning whatever the [United States] and its followers want it to mean at any given time.\u201d The United States\u2019 rules-based order contrasts with an alternative order based on international law and the United Nations charter, which the Global South has long struggled over many decades to make more universal and equitable.\nThe Global South understands well the double standards and opaque criteria inherent in the United States\u2019 rules-based order. It observes, for example, how the United States conveniently invokes international law to de-legitimize Russia\u2019s unlawful invasion of Ukraine, and then intentionally undermines or attacks the same laws when defending Israel\u2019s assorted invasions, occupations and war crimes. As one senior G7 diplomat told the Financial Times, the West\u2019s support for Israel\u2019s assault on Gaza means \u201cWe have definitely lost the battle in the Global South\u2026All the work we have done with the Global South [over Ukraine] has been lost\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Forget about rules, forget about world order. They won\u2019t ever listen to us again.\u201d\nViewed from the Middle East, the continuity of U.S. dominance over the international system through the rules-based order has long rested on uncritical bipartisan support for Israel, no matter the cost to U.S. standing and international law, and control over Gulf oil resources. Protecting Israel and oil resources has traditionally seen U.S. leaders actively back and arm authoritarian governments in the region and consistently prosecute \u201cforever wars\u201d to impose U.S. hegemony and ensure enormous profits for U.S. corporations. Successive U.S. administrations have helped suppress popular sentiment and movements across the region and attack international law provisions and institutions when they get in the way of purported U.S. interests.\nSeen in this historical and bipartisan context, it is easy to understand why the administration of President Joe Biden shifted so seamlessly from moralistic rhetoric about human rights to appeasing and selling arms to authoritarian Arab governments \u2014 just as the Trump administration did. This administration has moved from calling for Middle East peace to actively enabling Israel\u2019s horrific war on Gaza, defunding the UN agency that supports desperate Palestinian refugees \u2015 as the Trump administration also did \u2015 and attacking the landmark International Court of Justice cases against Israel and threatening the International Criminal Court (which the Trump administration also did).

New leaders are emerging: China, with its aggressive policies; Russia, driven by its isolation by the West; diplomacy-oriented India, which in 2023 led the G-20 \u2014 including the United States, European Union, Russia and China, to a wide-ranging, unanimous Leaders\u2019 Declaration; and many regional powerhouses.\nDr Ghosh notes that post-World-War-II multilateralism banked largely on the economic reliance of countries on the United States, \u201cwhose individual state objectives aligned with global ones at the time: financial stability, freer trade, and global development\u2026 these conditions no longer seem to apply.\u201d And, there is an urgent global demand to reform these 1944 Bretton Woods institutions \u2014 the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank \u2014 and governance systems to transparently and equitably serve the modern, multipolar world.\nTherefore, the United States should redefine its leadership role in today\u2019s context: yesterday\u2019s conflict will need to yield to collaborative efforts for tomorrow.

These experts do not expect a pivotal shift to occur in the United States\u2019 policies pertaining to the Global South. At the same time, a new U.S. administration has the opportunity to rectify Washington\u2019s past mistakes and to overcome ignorance of the Global South\u2019s autonomy and its efforts to improve the international order and bolster its own initiatives.\nThe 2024 U.S. presidential election is expected to have a major impact on the international community. The contours of Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 foreign policy are unclear; should former President Donald Trump be elected, foreign policy experts expect the United States to retrench from global governance and take a more nationalistic approach.\nScholars from across the Global South do not anticipate major changes in U.S. engagement with their countries, no matter who is elected, in light of the overall continuity in U.S. foreign policy during recent decades. Nonetheless, they see the U.S. election as a competition between pro-multilateralism and anti-multilateralism.\nWhile the United States is likely to continue to focus its efforts on countering China and fostering a Manichean view of the world, \u201cWest vs. East,\u201d \u201cdemocracy vs. autocracy,\u201d many in the Global South view the division in the world rather as being along the lines of \u201cGlobal North vs. Global South.\u201d this view is based on the longstanding and entrenched global inequalities and inequity that continue to create a wedge between Western powers on the one hand and the Majority World on the other.1The term \u201cMajority World\u201d is a reminder that the average income levels of those living in the West represent the income levels of a minority of people worldwide.\u00a0 According to the World Bank, 80% of the world\u2019s population lives on $10 or less per day.\nHistorically, the Global North has aggressively suppressed initiatives from the Global South that aimed to create a more balanced and equitable international system. Many in the Global South see little difference between Trump and President Joe Biden regarding substantive support for their issues, viewing the moves of both administrations as largely rhetorical and symbolic.\nIn this context, many Global South political and thought leaders no longer rely on the United States to reform global governance. Rather, they seek new partnerships and alternative multilateral forums that can help them advance their interests and secure international development and climate financing. Contrary to convention wisdom in the West, these actors seek to advance universalism of international norms, in contrast to the US-led \u201crules-based order,\u201d which a minority imposes on the majority while often ignoring these rules when they apply to their behavior.\nThis dynamic, rooted in colonial history, highlights the need for an equitable system that genuinelyincorporates the perspectives and aspirations of Global South states.\nThe United States Must Change its Foreign Policy in the Middle East or it will lose the Global South (Again)\nKarim Makdisi, Associate Professor of International Politics, The American University of Beirut\nFor much of the Global South, U.S. foreign policy and its shaping of the modern international order has been marked by double standards and continuity ensuring Western dominance by any means, regardless of who is president. At the heart of this dominance is what the U.S. establishment calls the \u201crules-based order,\u201d which, as the South African scholar John Dugard has argued, is in effect an amorphous and \u201ctacit agreement\u201d that \u201cbest advances the interests of the West, a chimera, meaning whatever the [United States] and its followers want it to mean at any given time.\u201d The United States\u2019 rules-based order contrasts with an alternative order based on international law and the United Nations charter, which the Global South has long struggled over many decades to make more universal and equitable.\nThe Global South understands well the double standards and opaque criteria inherent in the United States\u2019 rules-based order. It observes, for example, how the United States conveniently invokes international law to de-legitimize Russia\u2019s unlawful invasion of Ukraine, and then intentionally undermines or attacks the same laws when defending Israel\u2019s assorted invasions, occupations and war crimes. As one senior G7 diplomat told the Financial Times, the West\u2019s support for Israel\u2019s assault on Gaza means \u201cWe have definitely lost the battle in the Global South\u2026All the work we have done with the Global South [over Ukraine] has been lost\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Forget about rules, forget about world order. They won\u2019t ever listen to us again.\u201d\nViewed from the Middle East, the continuity of U.S. dominance over the international system through the rules-based order has long rested on uncritical bipartisan support for Israel, no matter the cost to U.S. standing and international law, and control over Gulf oil resources. Protecting Israel and oil resources has traditionally seen U.S. leaders actively back and arm authoritarian governments in the region and consistently prosecute \u201cforever wars\u201d to impose U.S. hegemony and ensure enormous profits for U.S. corporations. Successive U.S. administrations have helped suppress popular sentiment and movements across the region and attack international law provisions and institutions when they get in the way of purported U.S. interests.\nSeen in this historical and bipartisan context, it is easy to understand why the administration of President Joe Biden shifted so seamlessly from moralistic rhetoric about human rights to appeasing and selling arms to authoritarian Arab governments \u2014 just as the Trump administration did. This administration has moved from calling for Middle East peace to actively enabling Israel\u2019s horrific war on Gaza, defunding the UN agency that supports desperate Palestinian refugees \u2015 as the Trump administration also did \u2015 and attacking the landmark International Court of Justice cases against Israel and threatening the International Criminal Court (which the Trump administration also did). As a result, the United States is now seen by many in the Arab world as the as the biggest threat to stability and security, with a near consensus of 94% of the Arab world disapproving of Biden\u2019s staunch defense and arming of the most right-wing, extremist government in Israeli history during its mass violence in Gaza.\u00a0\nIn this sense, Trump\u2019s anti-multilateralist \u201cAmerica First\u201d rhetoric and Biden\u2019s (and Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019) ostensibly pro-multilateralist \u201cAmerica is back\u201d slogan are not seen as so different in the Middle East and Global South. Both Republican and Democratic parties have attacked international law and institutions (and their representatives) when they have not aligned with purported U.S. interests. There is no reason to believe that the 2024 presidential election will fundamentally change this approach or challenge this long continuity in U.S. policy, particularly if Trump wins. Harris, at least, may adjust U.S. rhetoric and even policy on the margins as she understands that Biden\u2019s extreme pro-Israel position is one reason why he was projected to lose to Trump, given how deeply unpopular Biden\u2019s Gaza policy is domestically with young voters. Could a Harris win somehow better align the capricious U.S. rules-based order with the more universal order based around international law that is championed by the Global South? To do so requires the United States to fundamentally change its policy in the Middle East.\nHow Do US Election Outcomes Impact Africa?\nChris O. \u00d2g\u00fanm\u1ecd\u0301d\u1eb9d\u00e9, Editor at The Republic\nAfrica\u2019s decades-long clamor for reform of key global governance institutions has reached a crescendo in recent years. Last year, the African Union joined the G-20 as a permanent member, and South Africa is set to assume control of the forum\u2019s presidency later this year. African states have stepped up their demands for their bloc to get at least two permanent seats on the UN Security Council with veto powers, as well as five non-permanent seats. Amid rising debt burdens, a rapidly escalating climate emergency and stalled progress toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, a multiplicity of voices on the continent has proposed steps to transform the global financial architecture.\nBiden\u2019s pledge to support efforts to reform the U.N. and other international organizations did not come to fruition. But the next U.S. administration can and should champion this endeavor. Although the conventional wisdom in some quarters is that the presumptive front-runners in the 2024 U.S. presidential election \u2014 Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump \u2014 represent contrasting visions of multilateralism, this understates the bipartisan commitment in Washington to the use of international institutions to advance U.S. geopolitical interests. For many nations and populations in the Global South, the distinction between Democratic and Republican administrations is decidedly nil.\nNonetheless, African voices \u2014 governments, private sector organizations, civil society groups, and the like \u2014 need to continue building bridges with their peers in Global Majority countries to achieve valuable reforms in the global governance order. Several proposals laid out in the Sal Declaration and by the African High-Level Working Group on the Global Financial Architecture have found support in some European circles and could be built upon. At a time when the United States seeks to convince African nations that it can be trusted as an international partner, supporting the continent\u2019s immediate and long-term development aspirations would be a tangible way to build lasting support beyond a presidential term.\nTransacting with Trust\nShuva Raha, Fellow and International Cooperation Lead at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water\nIn a June 2020 Stimson Issue Brief, Multilateralism for Chronic Risks, written amidst the raging COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. Arunabha Ghosh, Founder-CEO of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), one of Asia\u2019s leading think tanks, wrote that a \u201cperfect storm of shocks\u201d \u2014 \u201ca series of environmental, economic, and social crises\u201d \u2014 could cripple even the mightiest militaries and economies, and undo decades of progress in less developed countries.

The US-NATO\u2013led defense of Ukraine further polarized the world with its \u201cwith-us-or-against-us\u201d demand for condemnations and sanctions against Russia. India followed its independent foreign policy and, despite its warming relations with the United States during both Republican and Democratic administrations, called for cessation of hostilities \u2014 without taking sides. Similar stances by many countries reflect their growing \u2014 and unifying \u2014 aversion toward being coerced into chaos while they focus on their own priorities.\nNow, in 2024, the world is truly in de minimis multilateralism. At least 97 countries, with ~2 billion voters, have elections this year. Many have yielded surprising results; the focus now is on the U.S. Presidential race in November, mired in controversies.

At the heart of this dominance is what the U.S. establishment calls the \u201crules-based order,\u201d which, as the South African scholar John Dugard has argued, is in effect an amorphous and \u201ctacit agreement\u201d that \u201cbest advances the interests of the West, a chimera, meaning whatever the [United States] and its followers want it to mean at any given time.\u201d The United States\u2019 rules-based order contrasts with an alternative order based on international law and the United Nations charter, which the Global South has long struggled over many decades to make more universal and equitable.\nThe Global South understands well the double standards and opaque criteria inherent in the United States\u2019 rules-based order. It observes, for example, how the United States conveniently invokes international law to de-legitimize Russia\u2019s unlawful invasion of Ukraine, and then intentionally undermines or attacks the same laws when defending Israel\u2019s assorted invasions, occupations and war crimes. As one senior G7 diplomat told the Financial Times, the West\u2019s support for Israel\u2019s assault on Gaza means \u201cWe have definitely lost the battle in the Global South\u2026All the work we have done with the Global South [over Ukraine] has been lost\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Forget about rules, forget about world order. They won\u2019t ever listen to us again.\u201d\nViewed from the Middle East, the continuity of U.S. dominance over the international system through the rules-based order has long rested on uncritical bipartisan support for Israel, no matter the cost to U.S. standing and international law, and control over Gulf oil resources. Protecting Israel and oil resources has traditionally seen U.S. leaders actively back and arm authoritarian governments in the region and consistently prosecute \u201cforever wars\u201d to impose U.S. hegemony and ensure enormous profits for U.S. corporations. Successive U.S. administrations have helped suppress popular sentiment and movements across the region and attack international law provisions and institutions when they get in the way of purported U.S. interests.\nSeen in this historical and bipartisan context, it is easy to understand why the administration of President Joe Biden shifted so seamlessly from moralistic rhetoric about human rights to appeasing and selling arms to authoritarian Arab governments \u2014 just as the Trump administration did. This administration has moved from calling for Middle East peace to actively enabling Israel\u2019s horrific war on Gaza, defunding the UN agency that supports desperate Palestinian refugees \u2015 as the Trump administration also did \u2015 and attacking the landmark International Court of Justice cases against Israel and threatening the International Criminal Court (which the Trump administration also did). As a result, the United States is now seen by many in the Arab world as the as the biggest threat to stability and security, with a near consensus of 94% of the Arab world disapproving of Biden\u2019s staunch defense and arming of the most right-wing, extremist government in Israeli history during its mass violence in Gaza.\u00a0\nIn this sense, Trump\u2019s anti-multilateralist \u201cAmerica First\u201d rhetoric and Biden\u2019s (and Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019) ostensibly pro-multilateralist \u201cAmerica is back\u201d slogan are not seen as so different in the Middle East and Global South. Both Republican and Democratic parties have attacked international law and institutions (and their representatives) when they have not aligned with purported U.S. interests. There is no reason to believe that the 2024 presidential election will fundamentally change this approach or challenge this long continuity in U.S. policy, particularly if Trump wins. Harris, at least, may adjust U.S. rhetoric and even policy on the margins as she understands that Biden\u2019s extreme pro-Israel position is one reason why he was projected to lose to Trump, given how deeply unpopular Biden\u2019s Gaza policy is domestically with young voters. Could a Harris win somehow better align the capricious U.S. rules-based order with the more universal order based around international law that is championed by the Global South? To do so requires the United States to fundamentally change its policy in the Middle East.\nHow Do US Election Outcomes Impact Africa?\nChris O. \u00d2g\u00fanm\u1ecd\u0301d\u1eb9d\u00e9, Editor at The Republic\nAfrica\u2019s decades-long clamor for reform of key global governance institutions has reached a crescendo in recent years. Last year, the African Union joined the G-20 as a permanent member, and South Africa is set to assume control of the forum\u2019s presidency later this year. African states have stepped up their demands for their bloc to get at least two permanent seats on the UN Security Council with veto powers, as well as five non-permanent seats. Amid rising debt burdens, a rapidly escalating climate emergency and stalled progress toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, a multiplicity of voices on the continent has proposed steps to transform the global financial architecture.\nBiden\u2019s pledge to support efforts to reform the U.N. and other international organizations did not come to fruition. But the next U.S. administration can and should champion this endeavor. Although the conventional wisdom in some quarters is that the presumptive front-runners in the 2024 U.S. presidential election \u2014 Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump \u2014 represent contrasting visions of multilateralism, this understates the bipartisan commitment in Washington to the use of international institutions to advance U.S. geopolitical interests. For many nations and populations in the Global South, the distinction between Democratic and Republican administrations is decidedly nil.\nNonetheless, African voices \u2014 governments, private sector organizations, civil society groups, and the like \u2014 need to continue building bridges with their peers in Global Majority countries to achieve valuable reforms in the global governance order. Several proposals laid out in the Sal Declaration and by the African High-Level Working Group on the Global Financial Architecture have found support in some European circles and could be built upon. At a time when the United States seeks to convince African nations that it can be trusted as an international partner, supporting the continent\u2019s immediate and long-term development aspirations would be a tangible way to build lasting support beyond a presidential term.\nTransacting with Trust\nShuva Raha, Fellow and International Cooperation Lead at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water\nIn a June 2020 Stimson Issue Brief, Multilateralism for Chronic Risks, written amidst the raging COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. Arunabha Ghosh, Founder-CEO of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), one of Asia\u2019s leading think tanks, wrote that a \u201cperfect storm of shocks\u201d \u2014 \u201ca series of environmental, economic, and social crises\u201d \u2014 could cripple even the mightiest militaries and economies, and undo decades of progress in less developed countries. During such existential crises, he noted, \u201ccountries impulsively turn inwards\u201d and the world must deal with \u201cde minimis multilateralism: what is the minimum on which interests converge?\u201d\nAmidst the pandemic, which was decimating lives, livelihoods, and national economies, in February 2022, the simmering Russia-Ukraine conflict escalated into war. The US-NATO\u2013led defense of Ukraine further polarized the world with its \u201cwith-us-or-against-us\u201d demand for condemnations and sanctions against Russia. India followed its independent foreign policy and, despite its warming relations with the United States during both Republican and Democratic administrations, called for cessation of hostilities \u2014 without taking sides. Similar stances by many countries reflect their growing \u2014 and unifying \u2014 aversion toward being coerced into chaos while they focus on their own priorities.\nNow, in 2024, the world is truly in de minimis multilateralism. At least 97 countries, with ~2 billion voters, have elections this year. Many have yielded surprising results; the focus now is on the U.S. Presidential race in November, mired in controversies. Worldwide, speculation is rife about how party ideologies would shape U.S. foreign policy, and how domestic imperatives could overwhelm diplomatic acumen.\nMeanwhile, countries are instituting unlikely yet strategic mini-laterals, forging new trade and currency connections, and adopting novel technologies and media strategies. New leaders are emerging: China, with its aggressive policies; Russia, driven by its isolation by the West; diplomacy-oriented India, which in 2023 led the G-20 \u2014 including the United States, European Union, Russia and China, to a wide-ranging, unanimous Leaders\u2019 Declaration; and many regional powerhouses.\nDr Ghosh notes that post-World-War-II multilateralism banked largely on the economic reliance of countries on the United States, \u201cwhose individual state objectives aligned with global ones at the time: financial stability, freer trade, and global development\u2026 these conditions no longer seem to apply.\u201d And, there is an urgent global demand to reform these 1944 Bretton Woods institutions \u2014 the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank \u2014 and governance systems to transparently and equitably serve the modern, multipolar world.\nTherefore, the United States should redefine its leadership role in today\u2019s context: yesterday\u2019s conflict will need to yield to collaborative efforts for tomorrow. Moreover, Washington should transact with allies and partners with trust and respect. It should see the world beyond U.S. borders as a multilateral tapestry to be rewoven, with new co-weavers, new threads, and a brand new design.\nNotes1The term \u201cMajority World\u201d is a reminder that the average income levels of those living in the West represent the income levels of a minority of people worldwide.\u00a0 According to the World Bank, 80% of the world\u2019s population lives on $10 or less per day.\nThis article addresses perspectives from Global South experts on how the upcoming U.S. presidential elections and the change in administrations may affect Global South countries. These experts do not expect a pivotal shift to occur in the United States\u2019 policies pertaining to the Global South. At the same time, a new U.S. administration has the opportunity to rectify Washington\u2019s past mistakes and to overcome ignorance of the Global South\u2019s autonomy and its efforts to improve the international order and bolster its own initiatives.\nThe 2024 U.S. presidential election is expected to have a major impact on the international community. The contours of Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 foreign policy are unclear; should former President Donald Trump be elected, foreign policy experts expect the United States to retrench from global governance and take a more nationalistic approach.\nScholars from across the Global South do not anticipate major changes in U.S. engagement with their countries, no matter who is elected, in light of the overall continuity in U.S. foreign policy during recent decades. Nonetheless, they see the U.S. election as a competition between pro-multilateralism and anti-multilateralism.\nWhile the United States is likely to continue to focus its efforts on countering China and fostering a Manichean view of the world, \u201cWest vs. East,\u201d \u201cdemocracy vs. autocracy,\u201d many in the Global South view the division in the world rather as being along the lines of \u201cGlobal North vs. Global South.\u201d this view is based on the longstanding and entrenched global inequalities and inequity that continue to create a wedge between Western powers on the one hand and the Majority World on the other.1The term \u201cMajority World\u201d is a reminder that the average income levels of those living in the West represent the income levels of a minority of people worldwide.\u00a0 According to the World Bank, 80% of the world\u2019s population lives on $10 or less per day.\nHistorically, the Global North has aggressively suppressed initiatives from the Global South that aimed to create a more balanced and equitable international system. Many in the Global South see little difference between Trump and President Joe Biden regarding substantive support for their issues, viewing the moves of both administrations as largely rhetorical and symbolic.\nIn this context, many Global South political and thought leaders no longer rely on the United States to reform global governance. Rather, they seek new partnerships and alternative multilateral forums that can help them advance their interests and secure international development and climate financing. Contrary to convention wisdom in the West, these actors seek to advance universalism of international norms, in contrast to the US-led \u201crules-based order,\u201d which a minority imposes on the majority while often ignoring these rules when they apply to their behavior.\nThis dynamic, rooted in colonial history, highlights the need for an equitable system that genuinelyincorporates the perspectives and aspirations of Global South states.\nThe United States Must Change its Foreign Policy in the Middle East or it will lose the Global South (Again)\nKarim Makdisi, Associate Professor of International Politics, The American University of Beirut\nFor much of the Global South, U.S. foreign policy and its shaping of the modern international order has been marked by double standards and continuity ensuring Western dominance by any means, regardless of who is president.

        "text": "Venezuelan opposition leader rejects idea of redoing contested presidential election\nSAO PAULO (AP) \u2014 Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado on Thursday rejected a proposal from Brazil\u2019s president that Venezuela hold a new presidential election following the contested results of last month\u2019s vote.\n\nHer comments came shortly after Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva said that he still doesn\u2019t recognize Nicol\u00e1s Maduro as the winner of last month\u2019s presidential election in Venezuela, and that his counterpart could call for a new vote \u201cif he has good sense.\u201d\n\nHe also said that Maduro still owes an explanation to Brazilians and the rest of the world.\n\nMachado said during a virtual press conference with Argentine media that redoing the election would be \u201can insult\u201d to the people, and she asked if a second election were held and Maduro still didn\u2019t accept the results, \u201cdo we go for a third one?\u201d\n\nBrazil is by far South America\u2019s largest nation and shares one of Venezuela\u2019s longest land borders. Unlike many other nations that have either recognized Maduro or Gonz\u00e1lez as the winner, the governments of Brazil, Colombia and Mexico have taken a more neutral stance by neither rejecting nor accepting it when Venezuela\u2019s electoral authorities declared Maduro the winner at the ballot box.\n\n\u201cMaduro still has six months left in his term. He is the president regardless of the election. If he has good sense, he could call upon the people of Venezuela, perhaps even call for new elections, create an electoral committee and allow observers from around the world to monitor,\u201d Lula said in an interview with Radio T, based in the southern state of Parana.\n\nWATCH: The world knows \u2018Venezuelan people voted for change,\u2019 opposition leader Machado says\n\nIn a joint statement, the three countries called on Venezuela\u2019s electoral body to release tens of thousands of vote tally sheets, considered the ultimate proof of results.\n\nUnder Lula, the country has been an important mediator, including with the Barbados Agreement reached in October, when Maduro\u2019s administration and political opposition reached an accord on a new election that triggered relief from U.S. sanctions.\n\nCelso Amorim, Lula\u2019s closest international adviser and a former foreign relations minister, went to Caracas in July to monitor the election.\n\nAddressing a Senate committee Thursday morning, Amorim said Maduro had assured him on the day after the vote that the tally sheets would soon be released. However, that still hasn\u2019t happened.\n\n\u201cPresident Lula said several times that the tally sheets must be released by the National Electoral Council,\u201d Amorim said. New elections would require solid, robust verification, he added. \u201cBut that would imply lifting sanctions.\u201d\n\nMaduro uninvited observers from the European Union after it refused to lift sanctions on key members of his administration, including the vice president.\n\nREAD MORE: World leaders voice concern as thousands arrested in Venezuela after disputed election\n\nVenezuelan law allows for another vote whenever the National Electoral Council or judicial authorities annul an election found to be fraudulent or whose outcome was impossible to determine. The new election would have to take place within six to 12 months under the same conditions as the annulled vote and the same candidates must appear on the ballot.\n\nLogistics, laws and costs aside, a new election would be a risky gamble for Maduro and his allies as July\u2019s vote and subsequent protests showed they have lost support across the country and can no longer bank on a cadre of die-hard supporters, known as \u201cChavistas,\u201d as well as public employees and others whose businesses or employment depend on the state to comfortably beat opponents.\n\nAlthough electoral authorities declared Maduro the winner of the highly anticipated election, they have yet to produce detailed voting tallies to back up their claim. The opposition, however, revealed that it collected tally sheets from more than 80% of the 30,000 electronic voting machines nationwide, showing that Maduro lost by a more than 2-to-1 margin.\n\nAn AP review of the tally sheets released indicates that Gonzalez won significantly more votes than the government has claimed. The analysis casts serious doubt on the official declaration that Maduro won.\n\nThe AP processed almost 24,000 images representing the results from 79% of voting machines, resulting in tabulations of 10.26 million votes. The processed tally sheets also showed Gonzalez receiving more votes on 20,476 receipts compared to only 3,157 for Maduro.\n\nPertossi reported from Buenos Aires. Regina Garc\u00eda Cano in Caracas, Venezuela, and Joshua Goodman in Miami, contributed to this report.",

        "text": "US Presidential Election 2024: Harris says will debate Trump twice\nWashington (AFP)\n\n\n\nKamala Harris's campaign said on Thursday that she would debate her Republican rival Donald Trump twice, while their running mates would do so once.\n\n\n\nThe two camps had already agreed to one presidential debate on September 10 and a vice-presidential face-off on October 1, but the Trump campaign had been pushing for two further presidential debates in September and an extra VP encounter.\n\n\n\n\"The debate about debates is over. Donald Trump's campaign accepted our proposal for three debates -- two presidential and a vice presidential debate,\" the Harris campaign said in a statement.\n\n\n\nIt added that, \"assuming Donald Trump actually shows up on September 10,\" Harris running mate Tim Walz would debate Trump's VP pick JD Vance on October 1, and then there would be another Trump-Harris face-off later in October.\n\n\n\nThe Trump campaign did not immediately respond to an AFP request for its reaction to the statement.\n\n\n\nAlready a trailblazer as the first female and first Black and South Asian vice president, Harris is aiming to make history as the first woman president -- and is scrambling to pitch herself to the public ahead of November 5.\n\n\n\nShe and Walz head to the Democrats' national convention in Chicago next week on the back of a blockbuster start, in which they have reversed Trump's polling leads, obliterated fundraising records and attracted huge ebullient crowds to their rallies.\n\n\n\nCBS posted Wednesday on social media platform X that it had offered four potential vice-presidential debates in September and October to Walz, the governor of Minnesota, and Vance, a senator from Ohio.\n\n\n\nBoth accepted October 1, which comes after early voting has already started in several states, but Vance suggested an earlier debate on September 18 that he said had been offered by CNN.\n\n\n\nThe Harris and Trump debate on September 10 will be hosted by ABC News, a channel the president had previously balked at, saying he was in a legal dispute with its executives.",

        "text": "Trump may surprise us on the Ukraine war\nThe timing of the US presidential election in November and the inauguration of the next US president in January will likely coincide with a lower tempo period in the Ukraine war as both sides hunker down for the winter. This does not mean that the fighting stops, but it does mean that military activity will appear to decline relative to the higher tempo spring and summer months. It is likely neither side will be able to make decisive inroads during this time. While a re-elected Democratic administration may continue its current level of support for Ukraine even if it is unclear who is winning the war, what might a newly elected Trump administration do?\n\nRussia\u2019s stalled momentum\n\nOver the last seven months, Russia has attempted to exploit the failure of the 2023 Ukrainian counter-offensive, the late 2023 civil-military crisis in the Ukrainian government, and the long debate on US aid to Ukraine that deprived the Ukrainians of much needed munitions and equipment in early 2024. The Russian military has been conducting a large-scale offensive campaign on the ground and in the air to pummel the Ukrainian military and to influence the political calculus of Ukraine\u2019s government and its Western supporters.\n\nBut for all its efforts, and the loss of 180,000 troops in that time, Russia has only made minor territorial gains. It has not changed the willingness of the Ukrainian military to fight, or the will of the Ukrainian government to continue its defence against what they view as an existential war being waged upon them.\n\nAs Russia\u2019s current offensives continue but begin to lose momentum, Ukraine has been focused on the reconstitution of its forces in the wake of the 2023 counter-offensive and a long and bitter debate over mobilisation. The Ukrainians, however, have recently shocked the Russians, and their supporters, with a major operation in Russia\u2019s Kursk Oblast.\n\nFour factors will influence the war in 2025\n\nFour things will have a major influence on the war.\n\nThe first is the impact of Russia\u2019s ongoing offensive and whether it will take additional territory before the Russian ground forces culminate. While the prospect of a Russian breakthrough cannot be discounted, Moscow will most likely continue to undertake assaults on multiple axes, which will force Kyiv to commit troops and firepower it would prefer to preserve for the offensives to come.\n\nWhile the Ukrainian Kursk operation is attempting to change the status quo in the war, the biggest impact on the dynamics of the conflict could be a return of Donald Trump to the White House.\n\nA second influence will be the outcome of the ongoing Ukrainian operation inside Russia\u2019s Kursk Oblast. Having already humiliated Putin and the Russian army with their surprise attack last week, Ukraine has multiple options for how it can politically and strategically exploit its successes in this new operation.\n\nA third impact on Ukraine\u2019s 2025 operations will be the winter. Ukrainians have a miserable winter coming because of Russia\u2019s destruction of about 50 per cent of the country\u2019s power-generating capacity needed for the winter months. This will have a political impact on Ukrainians\u2019 view of their government and the war. The winter will also be a time when both the Ukrainian and Russian militaries will be conducting long-range strike operations and making final assessments, plans, and logistic stockpiling for ground operations in the spring.\n\nHowever, while the Ukrainian Kursk operation is attempting to change the status quo in the war, the biggest impact on the dynamics of the conflict could be a return of Donald Trump to the White House.\n\nTrump camp\u2019s views on Ukraine\n\nThere are some indicators about which way a second-term President Trump might lean. Presidential candidate Trump has claimed that he would end the Ukraine war quickly if he were elected. A plan drawn up by two former members of Trump\u2019s National Security Council staff, Keith Kellogg and Fred Fleitz, proposes a ceasefire based on current frontlines on the battlefield, however this is not known to have been endorsed by Trump.\n\nVice-Presidential candidate JD Vance has been very open about his views on Ukraine. After Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, Vance stated that \u201cI don\u2019t really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another.\u201d And, in a New York Times opinion piece in April 2024, Vance wrote that \u201cUkraine\u2019s challenge is not the GOP; it\u2019s math. Ukraine needs more soldiers than it can field, even with draconian conscription policies. And it needs more mat\u00e9riel than the United States can provide. This reality must inform any future Ukraine policy.\u201d\n\nNotwithstanding the apparently cordial Zelensky\u2013Trump phone call in the wake of the Republican National Convention, a Trump administration will be difficult to navigate for the Ukrainians. In the most recent Pew Research Center survey, published in May, less than half of Republican Party voters have a favourable view of NATO compared to 75 per cent of Democratic Party voters. Nearly half (49%) of Republican voters believe the United States is giving too much aid to Ukraine.\n\nIf these sentiments are taken together with Trump\u2019s role in encouraging a four-month interruption in US assistance to Ukraine in 2023, his assertions that he would let Russia \u201cdo whatever the hell they want\u201d to NATO countries that did not spend enough, and his recent comments about Taiwan not paying America enough to guarantee its defence, a picture begins to form about how a US administration under Trump might approach the world. But it remains an opaque view at best.\n\nQuick solutions will prove elusive\n\nShould Trump not be able to achieve a quick solution in the Ukraine war, he could well turn on Putin and increase US support to Ukraine.\n\nThe Russians have previously stated that any peace plan proposed by a Trump administration would have to reflect the reality on the ground in Ukraine, but that Putin remains open to talks. To this must now be added the reality on the ground in Kursk. However, should Trump not be able to achieve a quick solution in the Ukraine war, he could well turn on Putin and increase US support to Ukraine.\n\nThere is much that might happen to impact voter intentions between now and the November election. But one thing is certain. The Ukrainians understand what is at stake if they lose Russia\u2019s war of aggression. Even if a Trump administration attempts to force them into an unsustainable armistice, Ukraine would likely choose to fight on without US support. That is still a better option than subjecting themselves to what is likely to be only a short-term reprieve from ongoing Russian predation.",

        "text": "UChicago political scholars reflect on the DNC, 2024 election\nAs Chicago prepares to host the Democratic National Convention, the 2024 U.S. presidential race looks entirely different than it did a few short weeks ago.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is now the Democratic candidate\u2014with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate\u2014after President Joe Biden made the unprecedented decision to drop out of the race, only a week after former President Donald Trump survived an assassination attempt.\n\nNow, Democrats will gather in Chicago from Aug. 19-22, setting the stage for the final months of the election. Chicago has hosted the DNC several times, but the 1968 convention often sticks in popular and historical memory. Earlier that year, President Lyndon B. Johnson announced he would not seek reelection, requiring delegates to vote for a new nominee. Outside the convention, thousands of police and anti-Vietnam War protestors clashed violently, all televised for the world to see.\n\nWe spoke to Profs. Elisabeth Clemens, John Mark Hansen and William Howell, leading University of Chicago scholars, to get their thoughts on the significance of this political moment, comparisons to the 1968 convention and the issues that will shape the remainder of the election.\n\nA lot has happened in the past few weeks. From your scholarly perspective, how are you thinking about this unique political moment?\n\nClemens: After years of focus on democratic erosion, the past few months have unsettled any confidence in predictions. The election results in India, for the European parliament, in France, in Britain, or in Venezuela provide evidence of both deep vulnerabilities and unexpected possibilities for democratic politics. In this context, I will watch for how the U.S. candidates are\u2014or are not\u2014able to persuade voters that it is worth voting.\n\nHowell: Historically, there have been instances when an incumbent president withdrew during an election year, as in 1968. There have been previous assassination attempts on presidents, former presidents and candidates. There have been plenty of elections when uncertainty about a party\u2019s nomination ran right through a brokered convention.\n\nWhat we've been observing over the course of the last month is altogether exceptional: An incumbent president who secured all the delegates needed for the nomination but who withdrew from the campaign just weeks before the convention for reasons that have nothing to do with a political scandal or with a falling out with his party on the basis of policy issues\u2014and a vice president emerging within hours as the new candidate. On split screen, meanwhile, you have Trump not just wielding, but flaunting his total control over the Republican Party, which was only enhanced through this recent assassination attempt; and then him selecting, if not a facsimile, then certainly a loyal servant as his vice president.\n\nAll of this has happened in a matter of weeks. Have we seen some of the elements of this drama before? Sure. Have we seen them strung together in the way that we have this last month? Not even close.\n\nHansen: In my election analysis, I tend to emphasize the \u201cfundamentals\u201d\u2014partisanship, state of the economy, war and peace, positioning on issues\u2014over the particulars of the candidates. The fundamentals work because they prioritize historical experience and discount idiosyncrasies. But we\u2019ve never had so many idiosyncrasies.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult not to compare this DNC to the one held in Chicago in 1968. What are a few key parallels and differences between them?\n\nHansen: Some people seem to fixate on the comparison out of hope and some out of fear, but I don\u2019t think the parallels are so great. In 1968, two national leaders were assassinated (King and Kennedy), there were riots in cities large and small (including Chicago), U.S. soldiers were fighting in Vietnam, and the movement against the war was vastly larger than anything we\u2019ve seen this year. Chicago was controlled by a machine. The Democratic Party was deeply split over the war, and George Wallace was running an independent campaign to reverse the progress in civil rights. There are deep social cleavages now, but they are between the parties rather than within the parties.\n\nHowell: After Biden stepped down, there was a brief moment where we might have seen something like the \u201868 convention\u2014if a stalwart of the liberal wing of the Democratic Party had stepped forward to contest Harris, and if a divided party had sought to reconcile its differences in a brokered convention. But that moment vanished almost instantly. The party fell in line behind Harris. And despite lingering cleavages\u2014particularly over the war in Gaza\u2014the party appears entirely unified in its support for Harris.\n\nMoreover, this convention is coming on the heels of a sustained period of social, racial and political tumult, as occurred in \u201868. And let us also note that Chicago's mayor today looks very different from the Mayor Daley from \u201868. It\u2019s inconceivable that Mayor Johnson will encourage the police force to crack down on protesters, as Daley did. On the whole, then, it\u2019s hard to see how this year\u2019s convention looks anything like the division, upheaval and violence that defined the one in 1968.",

        "text": "MIAMI HERALD: A hundred thousand Venezuelans are considering leaving the country right now, poll says\nAs the Nicolas Maduro regime escalates the levels of violent repression to hold on to power amid accusations it stole the recent presidential election, more than 40% of all Venezuelans say that they are now considering fleeing their South American homeland, a new survey shows.\n\nVenezuelan polling firm Meganalisis surveyed 1,007 people between Aug. 8-11. Results showed that 43% of those interviewed are currently considering leaving Venezuela. This time the mass migration could happen quickly, the Meganalisis survey suggests, finding that the equivalent of about 600,000 people are considering leaving before the middle of next month, while an additional 930,000 would leave between October and December.\n\nWere such an enormous exodus to happen, it would add about 10.4 million to what\u2019s already the biggest external displacement in the Western Hemisphere, with over 7.7 million Venezuelans having left their country over the past decade.\n\nSc a massive wave of migration would have a devastating effect on the region, already under strain amid large levels of irregular migration because so many Latin American countries are currently experiencing political and humanitarian crises at the same time. Colombia, which shares a long land border with Venezuela, is home to almost three million Venezuelan migrants already.\n\nBut hundreds of thousands Venezuelans have also made the trip north to the U.S.-Mexico border in an attempt to enter the United States, which the Biden administration has attempted to discourage through several policies, including limits on asylum for those who cross unlawfully.\n\nA large-scale exodus out of Venezuela would likely exacerbate political tensions in the U.S., where migration is at the front and center of the upcoming presidential election between Republican former President Donald Trump and Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThe Meganalisis survey also showed that 93% of Venezuelans don\u2019t believe Maduro won the election. The government-controlled National Electoral Council said Maduro won with nearly 52% of the vote, but even voters who support the government believe that the Venezuelan strongman lost the election, according to the poll. The opposition, basing its case on a paper trail of the voting record, has made a credible case that challenger Edmundo Gonzalez won with a more than 2-1 margin of the vote.\n\nRub\u00e9n Chirinos, president of Meganalisis, said that Venezuelans who say they are considering leaving in the next four weeks have pretty much made up their minds to go.\n\n\u201cRight at this moment, we have about 100,000 people saying they are planning to leave right now. Those have already made up their minds,\u201d Chirinos told the Miami Herald in a telephone interview. \u201cThose that say they are considering doing it in a couple of months might be because they know they have to first work on the preparations, and those who say they are considering leaving next year is probably because they are leaning towards doing it but are still dealing with doubts.\u201d\n\nThe survey also showed that 70% of respondents said they are angry at the state of affairs in Venezuela, while at times also experiencing helplessness (59%), indignation (59%) and anxiety (48%), in response to a question where participants could select more than one of 10 different choices.\n\nThose claiming that they are happy amounted to 2.8%.\n\nOpposition leaders gathered and published the results of 80% of voting stations, which showed that Gonz\u00e1lez actually won the election with more than 65% of the vote. They have been warning that regional leaders, including Colombia, Mexico, Brazil, and the U.S., don\u2019t appear to understand that Venezuela is a ticking time bomb that will result in millions of refugees flooding their streets and traveling towards the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nMeanwhile, discontent continues to grow amid a massive crackdown that has led to the deaths of 25 people, injured dozens more and landed more than 2,000 in prison. The repression has recently taken on a more violent streak with the regime\u2019s employment of armed paramilitary groups witnesses say open fire at demonstrators without justification.\n\nMaduro announced in recent days that those arrested will soon be sent to Tocor\u00f3n and Tocuyito, two of the nation\u2019s worst prisons, and are now being held without access to legal representation.\n\nIn an attempt to increase its control over the Venezuelan population, Maduro has taken steps to clamp down on the usage of social media, banning the use of X for 10 days and discouraging the use of Whatsapp, Tik Tok and Instagram while the government-controlled National Assembly prepares new laws to combat what it calls the spread of \u201chate\u201d on social media.\n\nWhile the opposition, headed by leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, is backing demonstrations around the world in favor of a democratic transition and regional leaders seek to hold a presidential summit to facilitate it, Florida officials and leaders are raising the alarm on the possibility of a mass migration.\n\n\u201cScenes from Caracas make clear that Venezuelans are holding their ground and rejecting Maduro\u2019s election theft despite widespread violent repression. Concern about refugees is only part of the reason we must have their back,\u201d said Democratic U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who represents swaths of Miami-Dade and Broward County, in a statement to the Miami Herald. She said that there was a \u201crare opportunity to bring pressure towards a democratic transition and remedy the root cause of Venezuelan migration \u2014 autocracy and corruption\u201d because of the resilience of Venezuelans and the Biden administration\u2019s \u201ctireless diplomatic efforts.\u201d\n\nRepublican U.S. Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar of Miami warned in a statement that other nations in the Western Hemisphere would experience \u201can exodus of Venezuelans flooding their countries like never before if Nicol\u00e1s Maduro is successful in stealing the elections and remaining in power.\n\n\u201cMillions of Venezuelans are clinging to the hope that the nightmare of Chavista brutality is finally coming to an end, and that they can remain in their home country. The Biden Administration needs to be doing everything possible, including revising oil licenses so that Maduro and his \u2018secuaces\u2019 know that it\u2019s time to go,\u201d she added, using the Spanish word for henchmen.\n\nRepublican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio criticized the Biden-Harris administration, calling it \u201cdirectly responsible for perpetuating the agony of the Venezuelan people after waves of concessions to the narco-regime.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny individual with common sense has concluded that Maduro\u2019s sham \u2018electoral victory\u2019 would lead to yet another wave of mass migration,\u201d Rubio said \u201cThe Venezuelan people overwhelmingly voted for Edmundo Gonzalez as their president and dictator Maduro wants to steal yet another election.\u201d\n\nThe Biden administration has negotiated with Venezuela to resume direct deportations of undocumented migrants to the South American country. It also lifted oil and gas sanctions after Maduro pledged to hold free elections, although it restored them again in April. The U.S. has said that Maduro lost the election, but the administration has not officially recognized Gonzalez as the winner and president-elect. It has also said it is willing to discuss any proposal that would lead to a democratic transition in Venezuela, but denied reports from the the Wall Street Journal saying that it had offered Maduro \u2014 who faces federal corruption and drug-trafficking charges in the U.S. \u2014 amnesty if he steps down.\n\nhttps://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/venezuela/article291055910.html#storylink=cpy",

        "text": "Venezuela\u2019s opposition faces setback after countries suggest repeat of presidential election\nSAO PAULO (AP) \u2014 Venezuela\u2019s opposition was dealt a blow Thursday when countries that had been pressuring President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to release vote tallies backing his claim to victory in last month\u2019s presidential election began suggesting a repeat of the contest instead.\n\nThe proposal from the leftist governments of Brazil and Colombia, both Maduro allies, came less than three weeks after the results of the highly anticipated election came into question when the main opposition coalition revealed it has proof that its candidate defeated the president by a more than 2-to-1 margin.\n\nThe opposition categorically rejected any plan to redo the election.\n\nVenezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, during a virtual news conference with Argentine media, said that repeating the July 28 presidential election would be \u201can insult\u201d to the people, and she asked if a second election were held and Maduro still didn\u2019t accept the results, \u201cdo we go for a third one?\u201d\n\nIn Washington, U.S. President Joe Biden expressed support for new elections in comments to reporters that the White House later appeared to back away from.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s National Electoral Council, whose members are loyal to the ruling party, declared Maduro the winner hours after polls closed. But unlike previous presidential elections, the electoral body has not released detailed voting data to back up its claim that Maduro earned 6.4 million votes while Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, who represented the Unitary Platform opposition coalition, garnered 5.3 million.\n\nMeanwhile, Gonz\u00e1lez and Machado stunned Venezuelans when they revealed they obtained more than 80% of the vote tally sheets issued by every electronic voting machine after polls closed, that they said showed Gonz\u00e1lez winning by a wide margin.\n\nTheir revelation prompted governments around the world, including Colombia, Brazil and the U.S., to call on Maduro and the electoral council the publish a breakdown of results.\n\nThe opposition has consistently expressed the need for the international community\u2019s help to get Maduro to accept the unfavorable results of the election.\n\nUnlike many other nations that have either recognized Maduro or Gonz\u00e1lez as the winner, the governments of Brazil, Colombia and Mexico have taken a more neutral stance by neither rejecting nor accepting it when Venezuela\u2019s electoral authorities declared Maduro the winner at the ballot box. The three countries have called on Venezuela\u2019s electoral body to release tens of thousands of vote tally sheets, considered the ultimate proof of results.\n\nOn Thursday, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva said that still doesn\u2019t recognize Nicol\u00e1s Maduro as the winner of the election and that his counterpart should call for a new vote. Colombian President Gustavo Petro later echoed the call for a new election.\n\n\u201cMaduro still has six months left in his term,\u201d Lula said in an interview with Radio T. \u201cHe is the president regardless of the election. If he has good sense, he could call upon the people of Venezuela, perhaps even call for new elections, create an electoral committee and allow observers from around the world to monitor.\u201d\n\nBrazil is by far South America\u2019s largest nation and shares one of Venezuela\u2019s longest land borders. Under Lula, the country has been an important mediator, including in October, when Maduro\u2019s government and the opposition reached an agreement to work toward conditions for a free and fair presidential election to be held in the second half of 2024. That agreement triggered relief from U.S. sanctions.\n\nBut Maduro\u2019s government continuously tested the limits of the agreement over several months, and the U.S. reimposed the sanctions it had lifted on the oil, gas and mining sectors.\n\nVenezuelan law allows for another vote whenever the National Electoral Council or judicial authorities annul an election found to be fraudulent or whose outcome was impossible to determine. The new election would have to take place within six to 12 months under the same conditions as the annulled vote and the same candidates must appear on the ballot.\n\nLogistics, laws and costs aside, a new election would be a risky gamble for Maduro and his allies as July\u2019s vote and subsequent protests showed they have lost support across the country and can no longer bank on a cadre of die-hard supporters, known as \u201cChavistas,\u201d as well as public employees and others whose businesses or employment depend on the state to comfortably beat opponents.\n\nIn contrast to the stance of Brazil, Colombia and Mexico, the U.S. government has said that the evidence is clear that Gonz\u00e1lez won the election.\n\nHowever, when Biden was asked Thursday in Washington whether he would support new elections in Venezuela, the president said \u201cI do.\u201d Biden did not elaborate.\n\nA White House National Security Official who was not authorized to comment publicly later told The Associated Press that Biden was speaking to the \u201cabsurdity of Maduro and his representatives not coming clean about the July 28 elections.\u201d The official added that it is \u201cabundantly clear\u201d to the majority of Venezuelan people, the U.S., and other governments that Gonz\u00e1lez won the most votes in last month\u2019s election.\n\nAn AP review of the tally sheets released by the opposition indicates that Gonz\u00e1lez won significantly more votes than the government has claimed. The analysis casts serious doubt on the official declaration that Maduro won.\n\nThe AP processed almost 24,000 images representing the results from 79% of voting machines, resulting in tabulations of 10.26 million votes. The processed tally sheets also showed Gonz\u00e1lez receiving more votes on 20,476 receipts compared to only 3,157 for Maduro.\n\nPetro on Thursday floated several ideas to address Venezuela\u2019s political crisis including \u201cnew free elections\u201d and the establishment of a transitional government. The later had already been rejected by Machado at a news conference on Tuesday.\n\n___\n\nGarcia Cano reported from Mexico City.

        "text": "US election 2024: how Trump and Vance are trying to weaponise Kamala Harris\u2019s multiracial identity\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black and now, she wants to be known as Black.\u201d\n\nThis was what former president and current Republican party presidential candidate Donald Trump told the National Association of Black Journalists convention on July 31. It was a revealing insight into how he viewed his rival Kamala Harris\u2019s multiracial identity.\n\nDuring a heated exchange, Trump wrongly claimed that Harris, a woman of Black and South Asian heritage, had shifted her racial identity over the course of her career. Trump\u2019s vice-presidential candidate, JD Vance, subsequently doubled down in support of his boss, using language such as \u201cchameleon\u201d and \u201cflip flopping\u201d to describe Harris\u2019s politics and identity.\n\nThese comments were inherently disrespectful, as no one has the right to dictate another person\u2019s racial identity. But the Trump-Vance ticket has tried to use Harris\u2019s multiracial identity as a political tool to foster distrust in her among the American population.\n\nMultiracial racism in America\n\nSo, why was Trump and Vance\u2019s language so harmful? Despite being one of the most racially diverse countries in the world, the US has played a significant role in the perpetuation of racism.\n\nThe early 20th century introduced the \u201cone drop rule\u201d to America, which codified racism into law in some US states. It asserted that any person with even one Black ancestor was considered racially Black, regarding multiracial Americans with white ancestry \u201cimpure\u201d and viewed them as contaminated.\n\nThis was a political effort to maintain power over enslaved Black populations, as \u201cracial mixing\u201d blurred the lines between who could be considered free, and who was not.\n\nPrior to 1967 and the landmark Loving v Virginia judgment, which which ruled that laws banning interracial marriage were unconstitutional, almost half of the states enforced anti-miscegination laws that made interracial relations illegal, directed at Black-White unions but extended to ethnic groups. Therefore, mixed-race identities were discriminated against based on physical appearance, affecting their access to segregated residential areas and other social spaces.\n\nOne byproduct of this hateful racial theory was that mixed-race people, particularly women, became mythologised as deceitful and cunning tricksters. Historical and current white ruling classes feared multiracial people were somehow \u201cshape shifters\u201d, who accessed segregated white spaces and resources. Today, this appears in the way racial categories are imposed into which mixed-race people simply do not fit.\n\nWhile mixedness is no longer considered a contamination, lingering beliefs in racial stratification can provoke uncomfortable emotions towards mixed-race identities, whose physical appearances do not match racist stereotypes about different ethnic groups.\n\nThis all makes Trump and Vance\u2019s comments that much worse.\n\nContinues\u2026\n\nFor the full article written by Rhianna Garrett visit the Conversation.\n\nENDS",

        "text": "Young Black voters are becoming more conservative than their parents. Here's why\nYoung Black voters are becoming more conservative than their parents. Here's why\n\ntoggle caption Gerald Herbert/AP\n\nJen Iro, a 34-year-old from Texas, has been having a hard time with the current state of American politics. The last time she cast a ballot was for former President Barack Obama, and she doesn\u2019t think she\u2019ll vote this year either.\n\n\u201c[Politics are] not really important to me because as of right now, it seems to get worse and worse and worse, which really makes me more disinterested,\u201d Iro explained.\n\nIro is one of a growing number of young eligible voters who are feeling disconnected from politics and unable to identify with a political party. With a lack of affordable housing, climate change and rising costs, some millennials and Gen Zers are feeling hopeless about a political system that they don\u2019t believe has been catering to their needs.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nGenerally, young voters and Black voters tend to vote Democratic. In 2020, 92% of Black voters cast a vote for President Biden, while only 8% backed former President Donald Trump.\n\nHowever, there appears to be a shift within the Black electorate that has been widening over the years. According to Pew Research , 7% of Black voters over 50 currently identify as or lean Republican, while 17% of Black voters under 50 align with the Republican Party. It is unclear how Vice President Harris, as the Democrats' presidential hopeful, will fare with this group.\n\ntoggle caption Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nPeople tend to grow more conservative as they age. But among Black voters, younger generations may be the more conservative ones. In a pivotal election year, this conservative shift could have an impact on the upcoming presidential election.\n\nApproximately 40 million members of Gen Z will be eligible to vote in November. Of that 40 million, almost half are young people of color, including nearly 6 million Black youth.\n\nChristopher Towler is investigating why Iro and other young Black voters feel disconnected from politics. He\u2019s an associate professor at California State University, Sacramento and the principal investigator of the Black Voter Project.\n\n\u201c[Black voters] know the importance of elections,\u201d Towler said. \u201cThey understand what it means to have representation. But at the same time, they don't necessarily feel like they're being represented by either side of the aisle right now.\u201d\n\nLoading...\n\nTowler thinks that a lot of Black Americans who are less likely to vote, or vote less consistently, aren\u2019t seeing what politicians and parties claim as \u201cwins\u201d for the Black community impact their individual lives. People may not see more opportunities for themselves, as are often touted by the Biden Administration, including lowering Black unemployment or increasing Black small business loans and grants.\n\n\u201cI think there's an overall sentiment that they want something to support, they really understand the importance of this moment,\u201d Towler said. \u201cBut at the same time, they're not necessarily sure that their vote is going to change much.\u201d\n\nAs part of the Black Voter Project\u2019s 2024 national survey , Towler examined the level of Republican support among young voters.\n\n\u201cIn the data that I collected, the highest percentage of Black people that say they're going to vote for Trump is among the 18- to 29-year-old cohort, with about 22% saying they'll vote for Trump,\u201d Towler explained. \u201cThey're also the least supportive of the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nLoading...\n\nTowler thinks this partially could stem from young people thinking of the Civil Rights Movement as distant history.\n\n\u201cWe're getting into generations of young Black voters that are not just once removed, but maybe twice or three times removed from a civil rights generation,\u201d Towler said. \u201cThe way that they form their identity is less likely to be directly attached to the civil rights struggle...they're less likely to be suspicious of political institutions and they're more likely to support Trump and the Republicans.\u201d\n\nBernard Fraga, associate professor at Emory University, has also noticed this shift. To Fraga, this is simply a new era of Black voters.\n\n\u201cThe narrative that the Democrats kind of own the change issue, as in the idea that people who want things to be different than they are now, that's been something that's been true for a long time,\u201d Fraga said. \u201cNow, there's some folks in the electorate, particularly young people, who see the Republican Party as representing change.\u201d\n\nLoading...\n\nR.C. Maxwell, a 35-year-old Republican from Arizona, has witnessed a lot of change within the party over the years. He doesn\u2019t remember seeing much conservative outreach to young voters or voters of color before Donald Trump ran for president in 2015. Now, Maxwell says, the party is speaking directly to those groups.\n\nHe\u2019s also noticed more young people gravitate toward the GOP as they seek economic opportunities.\n\n\u201cWe want prosperity and we want secure borders and we want the American dream,\u201d Maxwell said. \u201cAnd only the Republican Party is speaking to this message because they have the policies in terms of limited government. Drill, baby, drill . \u201d\n\nKiah Hopkins is a 20-year-old from Georgia who plans on voting for the Democratic ticket in November, but knows people her age who are Republican-leaning or looking at a third-party candidate.\n\n\u201cThe thing that I hear a lot is, if a person is really conservative, they really like how the economics are handled by Republicans,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cUsually with social issues, they tend to be more liberal. At least, like, my friends who maybe are in the middle or leaning conservative, they'll be more liberal on social issues and more conservative with economics.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nShe says she has heard a lot of her peers say they aren\u2019t planning to vote in the presidential election, and it concerns her.\n\n\u201cFor people who say they're outright not voting just scares me because this is a privilege that we have, that our ancestors were able to fight for,\u201d Hopkins said.",

        "text": "The U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)\nKey Facts\n\nAlthough the U.S. has been involved in efforts to address the global AIDS crisis since the mid-1980s, the creation of the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in 2003 marked a significant increase in funding and attention to the epidemic. Now, 20 years in, PEPFAR reports saving more than 25 million lives and is currently providing HIV prevention and treatment services to millions.\n\nPEPFAR is the largest commitment by any nation to address a single disease in the world, credited with not only saving millions of lives but also helping to change the trajectory of the global HIV epidemic.\n\nPEPFAR funding is comprised of U.S. bilateral funding and U.S. contributions to multilateral organizations addressing HIV, primarily the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund).\n\nTo date, U.S. funding for PEPFAR has totaled approximately $120 billion, growing from $1.9 billion in FY 2004 to $6.5 billion in FY 2024; FY 2024 funding includes $4.8 billion provided for bilateral HIV efforts and $1.7 billion for multilateral efforts ($50 million for UNAIDS and $1.65 billion for the Global Fund). The President requested $6.1 billion for PEPFAR in FY 2025.\n\nPEPFAR was first authorized by Congress in FY 2004 for five years, and has since been reauthorized four times, most recently in March 2024. However, unlike prior reauthorizations which were each for a period of five years, the most recent reauthorization was only for one year, the result of an increasingly partisan environment. This has introduced some uncertainty about PEPFAR\u2019s future, even though the program will continue as long as Congress provides funding for it.\n\nThe outcome of the upcoming election will likely shape the reauthorization discussion as well as PEPFAR\u2019s future directions as the program seeks to define its approach to sustainability and looks toward the 2030 global goal of ending the AIDS epidemic as a public health threat.\n\nGlobal Situation\n\nHIV, the virus that causes AIDS (\u201cacquired immunodeficiency syndrome\u201d or Advanced HIV Disease), has become one of the world\u2019s most serious health and development challenges. Today, there are approximately 39.9 million people living with HIV, and tens of millions of people have died of AIDS-related causes since the beginning of the epidemic (see the KFF fact sheet on the global HIV epidemic).\n\nBox 1: Snapshot of Global Epidemic Today Number of people living with HIV: 39.9 million\n\nNumber of people newly infected with HIV: 1.3 million\n\nNumber of AIDS-related deaths: 630,000\n\nNumber of people with HIV on treatment: 30.7 million Notes: Reflects 2023 data.\n\nU.S. Government Efforts\n\nAlthough the U.S. has been involved in efforts to address the global HIV/AIDS crisis since the mid-1980s, the creation of the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in 2003 marked a significant increase in funding and attention to the epidemic. PEPFAR, the U.S. government\u2019s global effort to combat HIV and the largest global health program devoted to a single disease, is credited with saving millions of lives and helping to change the trajectory of the global HIV epidemic. It was announced in January 2003 during President George W. Bush\u2019s State of the Union and authorized by Congress that same year through the Leadership Act (see Table 1). The Leadership Act governs PEPFAR\u2019s HIV response, as well as U.S. participation in the Global Fund (an independent, international multilateral financing institution that provides grants to countries to address HIV, TB, and malaria) and bilateral assistance for TB and malaria programs. Congress has updated, extended, and made changes to the program through the Lantos-Hyde Act of 2008, the PEPFAR Stewardship Act of 2013, the PEPFAR Extension Act of 2018, and more recently, a short-term reauthorization of PEPFAR that extends certain timebound provisions through late March 2025 (see Table 1 and the KFF brief on PEPFAR reauthorization legislation over time). This short term reauthorization signaled a departure from the program\u2019s long history of strong bipartisan support across multiple Congresses and administrations when, in an increasingly partisan environment, it was caught up in the broader U.S. political debate over abortion (see the KFF brief on PEPFAR\u2019s short-term reauthorization). This has introduced some uncertainty about PEPFAR\u2019s future reauthorization prospects, though it is important to note that PEPFAR is a permanent part of U.S. law and will continue absent another reauthorization as long as Congress continues to provide funding to it.\n\nOrganization\n\nPEPFAR\u2019s original authorization established new structures and authorities, consolidating all U.S. bilateral and multilateral activities and funding for global HIV/AIDS. Several U.S. agencies, host country governments, and other organizations are involved in implementation.\n\nPEPFAR is overseen by the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator, who is appointed by the President, confirmed by the Senate, and reports directly to the Secretary of State, as established through PEPFAR\u2019s authorizing legislation. The current Coordinator, Dr. John Nkengasong, holds the rank of Ambassador and leads the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC) at the Department of State. The Coordinator has primary responsibility for the oversight and coordination of all U.S. global HIV activities and funding across multiple U.S. implementing agencies and departments. In addition, the Coordinator serves as the U.S. Government\u2019s board member to the Global Fund (the U.S. Government holds a permanent seat on the Global Fund\u2019s Board). Currently, the Coordinator is dual-hatted as the U.S. Special Representative for Global Health Diplomacy and also leads the broader Bureau of Global Health Security and Diplomacy, which brings together PEPFAR with global health security and global health diplomacy functions.\n\nIn addition to the Department of State, other implementing departments and agencies for HIV activities include: the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID); the Department of Health and Human Services, primarily through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), and National Institutes of Health (NIH); the Departments of Labor, Commerce, and Defense (DoD); and the Peace Corps.\n\nStrategy\n\nIn late 2022, PEPFAR released its new five-year strategy Fulfilling America\u2019s Promise to End the HIV/AIDS Pandemic by 2030, which outlines its approach to contributing to and supporting global efforts to reach the U.N. Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3) target of ending the global AIDS pandemic as a public health threat by 2030, while also strengthening public health systems. Complemented by three \u201cenablers\u201d (community partnerships, innovation, and leading with data), the strategy focuses on five \u201cstrategic pillars\u201d:\n\nensuring health equity for priority populations,\n\nachieving long-term sustainability in the HIV/AIDS response,\n\nleveraging public health systems to respond to health threats,\n\nstrengthening partnerships, and\n\nensuring programs are guided by science.\n\nThe strategy aims to align U.S. efforts with the UNAIDS Global AIDS Strategy 2021-2026 (as one of PEPFAR\u2019s goals is to reach the 95-95-95 testing and treatment targets \u2013 95% of people living with HIV knowing their HIV status; 95% of people who know their HIV positive status on treatment; and 95% of people on treatment with suppressed viral loads \u2013 by 2025) and the Global Fund Strategy for 2023-2028. (See the KFF dashboard monitoring progress toward global HIV targets, including PEPFAR\u2019s epidemic control target, in PEPFAR countries.)\n\nAs part of implementing its strategic pillar on sustainability, PEPFAR is focused on helping countries to develop and execute country \u201csustainability roadmaps,\u201d in conjunction with UNAIDS guidance; the aim for PEPFAR is to strengthen sustainability of country leadership and assets of HIV efforts in order to \u201csustain achievement of 95-95-95 goals; to ensure equity in its HIV response; and to protect against other public health threats\u201d (see the KFF brief on sustainability readiness in PEPFAR countries). While the importance of sustainability has long been recognized by PEPFAR, this approach marks a new point in this evolution, shaped by greater recognition of the contribution of HIV efforts to broader pandemic response and global health security, progress in the HIV response in many countries where PEPFAR operates, and shifting U.S. views of the role of PEPFAR and other development efforts in relation to assisted countries, particularly amid projected budget constraints.\n\nKey Activities and Results\n\nPEPFAR activities focus on expanding access to HIV prevention, treatment, and care interventions. These include provision of antiretroviral treatment, pre-exposure prophylaxis, voluntary male circumcision, condoms, and other commodities related to HIV services (see Table 2)., In addition, PEPFAR has launched specific initiatives in key strategic areas. For example, in 2015, PEPFAR launched DREAMS, a public-private partnership that aims to reduce HIV infections in adolescent girls and young women.\n\nThe latest results reported by PEPFAR indicate that it has:\n\nsupported testing services for 71.1 million people in FY 2023;\n\nprevented 5.5 million babies from being born with HIV, who would have otherwise been infected;\n\nprovided care for more than 7.0 million orphans, vulnerable children (OVC), and their caregivers;\n\nsupported training for nearly 327,000 new health care workers; and\n\nsupported antiretroviral treatment for 20.5 million people.\n\nAdditionally, it reports that in the 15 countries implementing the DREAMS initiative, new diagnoses among adolescent girls and young women have declined, with DREAMS areas experiencing greater declines in diagnosis among women in antenatal care compared to areas without DREAMS programming.\n\nCountries Reached\n\nPEPFAR bilateral programs span more than 50 countries. More countries are reached through U.S. contributions to the Global Fund. PEPFAR currently requires 25 countries and the Asia, Western Hemisphere, and West Africa regional programs to develop \u201cCountry Operational Plans\u201d (COPs) and \u201cRegional Operational Plans\u201d (ROPs), respectively, to document annual investments and anticipated results. OGAC reviews and the Global AIDS Coordinator approves COP/ROPs.\n\nFunding\n\nTotal PEPFAR funding includes bilateral funding for HIV activities conducted by U.S. implementing agencies as well as U.S. contributions to the Global Fund and UNAIDS, as specified by Congress for PEPFAR in annual appropriations bills. It represents the majority of U.S. global health funding (ranging from 51% to 55% over the past five years ) and is the largest commitment by any nation to address a single disease in the world. To date, PEPFAR funding has totaled approximately $120 billion, with funding reaching $6.5 billion in FY 2024 (see figure). The President requested $6.1 billion for PEPFAR in FY 2025.\n\nPEPFAR\u2019s creation marked a significant increase in the amount of funding provided by the U.S. for HIV. Trends in funding for bilateral programs and contributions to multilateral organizations are as follows (see the KFF fact sheet on the U.S. Global Health Budget: Global HIV Funding, Including PEPFAR and U.S. Global Health Budget: The Global Fund):\n\nBilateral HIV Funding: The majority of PEPFAR funding (ranging from 68-77% each year over the past decade) is provided for bilateral programs through the State Department (most of which is then transferred to other agencies), USAID, CDC, and DoD. Bilateral funding rose rapidly from $822 million in FY 2003 (the year before PEPFAR) to a peak of $5.0 billion in FY 2010. Between FY 2010 and FY 2013, it declined by more than $750 million. While it has risen since then, bilateral funding in FY 2024 ($4.8 billion) was still $233 million below its peak level, and funding has been mostly flat for the past several years.\n\nThe majority of PEPFAR funding (ranging from 68-77% each year over the past decade) is provided for bilateral programs through the State Department (most of which is then transferred to other agencies), USAID, CDC, and DoD.

Multilateral Contributions: The U.S. also supports global HIV efforts through contributions to the Global Fund and UNAIDS. Support for the Global Fund, which accounts for most of the multilateral contributions, increased rapidly in its early years and fluctuated over time; it reached its highest level to date ($2.0 billion) in FY 2023. In FY 2024, funding for the Global Fund was $1.65 billion, $375 million less than the FY 2023 level, though this is due to a legislative requirement that limits the amount the U.S. can contribute to the Global Fund to not more than 33% of all contributions. The U.S. contribution to UNAIDS was $45 million for most years over the past decade, but increased to $50 million in FY 2022, where it has remained.\n\nThe U.S. also supports global HIV efforts through contributions to the Global Fund and UNAIDS.

Emergency Funding: In FY 2021, an additional $3.8 billion in emergency supplemental funding was provided for bilateral HIV ($250 million) and the Global Fund ($3.5 billion) to address COVID-19.\n\nSpending Directives\n\nPEPFAR has included several spending directives, or earmarks, from Congress over the course of its history, many of which have changed over time:\n\nThe Leadership Act, PEPFAR\u2019s original authorization, included the following spending directives: 55% of funds were to be spent on treatment; 15% on palliative care; 20% on prevention, of which at least 33% be spent on abstinence-until-marriage programs; and 10% on OVC. While these were included as \u201csense of Congress\u201d recommendations, the treatment, OVC, and abstinence-until-marriage earmarks were made requirements as of FY 2006. The Lantos-Hyde Act relaxed some of these directives for the FY 2009 \u2013 FY 2013 period: while still requiring that 10% of funds be spent on programs targeting OVC, it changed the treatment earmark from 55% to requiring that at least half of bilateral HIV assistance be spent on treatment and care. It removed the 33% abstinence-until-marriage directive and replaced it with a requirement of \u201cbalanced funding\u201d for prevention to be accompanied by a report to Congress if less than half of prevention funds were spent on abstinence, delay of sexual debut, monogamy, fidelity, and partner reduction activities in any host country with a generalized (high prevalence) epidemic. The PEPFAR Stewardship Act, The PEPFAR Extension Act, and recent short-term reauthorization have maintained the language in the Lantos-Hyde Act.\n\nPEPFAR & The Global Fund\n\nThe U.S. is the single largest donor to the Global Fund. Appropriations for the U.S. contribution to the Global Fund totaled approximately $29.8 billion from FY 2001 through FY 2024. This includes, $3.5 billion in FY 2021 emergency funding that the U.S. government provided to the Global Fund to help the organization address the impacts of COVID-19 (in addition to the $250 million in emergency funds provided to bilateral HIV for COVID-19-related efforts).\n\nThe Global Fund provides another mechanism for U.S. support by funding programs developed by recipient countries, reaching a broader range of countries, and supporting TB, malaria, and health systems strengthening (HSS) programs in addition to (and beyond their linkage with) HIV. To date, over 120 countries have received Global Fund grants. Most Global Fund support (52%) has been committed to HIV and HIV/TB programs, followed by 29% to malaria, 15% to TB, and 4% to other health issues. The original authorization of PEPFAR, and subsequent reauthorizations, included a limit on annual U.S. contributions to the Global Fund that prevented them from causing cumulative U.S. contributions to exceed 33% of the Global Fund\u2019s total contributions; this requirement is in effect through FY 2023 (see the KFF fact sheet on the Global Fund).",

        "text": "Harris and Biden make first joint appearance since ticket change\nHarris will be 'one hell of a president', says Biden\n\nBiden praises Harris in first joint public appearance\n\nVice-President Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden have appeared at an event together for the first time since the president ended his run for a second term and Ms Harris replaced him as the Democratic nominee. The event, held just outside Washington DC, came as Donald Trump spoke at a news conference in New Jersey - his second campaign event in the past two days. The Democratic event on Thursday celebrated the Biden administration's newly announced deal to cut the cost of 10 common prescription drugs for millions of Americans. It also offered a glimpse of the pair's dynamic, weeks into a realignment of the party ticket.\n\nThe White House said some 2,300 people attended Thursday's rally in Upper Marlboro, Maryland - a Democratic stronghold. \u201cI have an incredible partner in the progress we made,\" the president said. \"She going to make one hell of a president.\" But more than the policy announcement, Mr Biden boosted his vice-president. He brought the crowd to their feet multiple times. The warm feelings were mutual. \"There's a lot of love in this room for our president,\" Ms Harris said. \"Few leaders in our nation have done more, on so many issues, including to expand access to affordable healthcare, than Joe Biden.\" US strikes deal to cut cost of 10 drugs for Medicare users\n\nWhat to know: Medicare negotiation lowers drug prices\n\nA different kind of Trump on display\n\nGetty Images\n\nThousands stood in line in the summer heat for the chance to see Mr Biden and Ms Harris speak. Social media video showed hundreds still in line as the venue reached capacity. It's the latest in a series of events Ms Harris has hosted that have drawn large crowds of supporters, marking a noticeable shift in energy in the presidential race. Ms Harris, however, has largely avoided media questions and has yet to sit down for an interview since becoming her party's candidate. Her supporters' enthusiasm is showing up in polling data, too. A recent survey from the Cook Political Report suggests Ms Harris is erasing former President Donald Trump's polling leads in Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Vivian Strong waited three hours to get into Thursday's event. She hoped to be part of a historic moment, she told the BBC. \"I feel a sense of urgency to actually ensure she gets elected,\" she said. \"I would hate to have another administration of the other guy.\" Before the president and vice-president took the stage, some supporters led the crowd in chants from Howard University - the historically black university Ms Harris attended in Washington DC. Many supporters of the vice-president donned pink and green, the colours of the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority (AKA) to which Ms Harris belonged. Linda Jones, a Howard alumna and a member of AKA, said their shared identity excites her. But she was also eager to see Mr Biden speak. \"I'm happy for President Biden to get something accomplished that he's worked so hard for,\" Ms Jones told the BBC, referring to the prescription drug deal. \"He's such a good man and I felt very bad he was leaving with a cloud, so now I feel [this policy] is one more boost for him.\"\n\nGetty Images\n\nMeanwhile, Trump, who spoke from his golf resort in Bedminster, lashed out as Ms Harris over the course of his press conference - his second in as many weeks. He argued that he was \"entitled to personal attacks\" against Ms Harris, and hit on his main campaign themes, attacking her record on inflation, crime and immigration. Trump, flanked by common grocery store items with signs showing cost increases in recent years for each, asked: \"How can a family afford that?\" Inflation in the US rose at the slowest pace in more than three years last month, marking relief for consumers. Inflation has been a top financial concern for many Americans. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to imagine what a Kamala Harris presidency would be like, because you are living through that nightmare right now,\u201d Trump said. \"I don't have a lot of respect for her. I don't have a lot of respect for her intelligence,\" he said, adding: \"People say, 'Oh be nice'. But they're not nice to me. They want to put me in prison.\" Earlier on Thursday, US media reported that the Secret Service would begin using bulletproof glass to protect Trump whenever he is speaking on stage at outdoor campaign events. The measure it typically done for sitting presidents, but an exception is being made in the wake of the attempted assassination of Trump last month in Pennsylvania. The Secret Service declined to comment on the reports.",

The torrent of misinformation is sparking concerns it could alter voting patterns and even affect the outcomes of the presidential and other elections.\n\nMisinformation is the inadvertent spread of false information with no specific intent to harm, while disinformation is false information designed to deliberately mislead people. Disinformation can include confusing or incorrect information about the voting process, which amounts to voter suppression, a continuation of Jim Crow-era attempts to disenfranchise Black voters through poll taxes and literacy tests. Today, Black, Brown, and immigrant communities continue to be impacted by mis- and disinformation, which sometimes exploits shared trauma among these communities to sway voters.\n\nFor example, during the 2020 election, Latinx voters in Florida were targeted by ads that falsely linked President Joe Biden to the repressive Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Immigrants who rely on translated content often find themselves subjected to mistranslations in WhatsApp groups and other social media platforms, where Spanish content moderation is limited.\n\nIn comparison to text, audio and visual mis- and disinformation can be especially difficult to detect and debunk. These threats are amplified by the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). Not only is AI used to produce realistic mis- and disinformation quickly and cheaply, bad actors can also use AI to reach communities of color with even more precision.\n\nAI-generated images featuring former President Donald Trump with Black voters were recently posted on social media in an apparent attempt to appeal to these voters. Some of these images have been created by conservative media groups and others by private individuals. They also create fake social media accounts to peddle false information to Black voters.\n\nElected officials, media outlets, and community groups should work together to provide accurate, reliable, and accessible sources of information for all people, especially communities that hold pre-existing suspicions of the political process. Online platforms have a responsibility to respect human rights, including the right to vote. These safeguards are necessary to ensure free and fair elections that lie at the heart of the US democratic system.",

        "text": "US vice presidential candidates agree to October debate\nA combination picture shows Republican vice presidential nominee and US Senator JD Vance speaking during his first rally as Donald Trump's running mate, in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on July 20, 2024, and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz speaking inside the Earth Rider Brewery in Superior, Wisconsin, on January 25, 2024. TOM BRENNER / REUTERS\n\nThe running mates of White House rivals Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have agreed to face off in at least one vice presidential debate, accepting an invitation from CBS News for an October 1 showdown.\n\nCBS posted Wednesday on social media platform X that it had offered four potential debates in September and October to Democratic Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Ohio's Republican Senator JD Vance.\n\n\"See you on October 1, JD,\" Walz replied, before the Harris campaign officially confirmed that it had accepted the date, which comes after early voting has already started in several states.\n\nVance said on Thursday, August 15, that he had also accepted the October 1 invitation, and suggested an earlier debate on September 18 that had been offered by CNN, arguing the \"American people deserve as many debates as possible.\"\n\nDoubt over debate taking place\n\nThere had been some doubt over whether the encounter would take place at all. Vance confirmed he was open to October 1 in an interview with Fox News on Wednesday but said he would not do \"one of these fake debates (...) where they don't actually have an audience,\" like the June 27 encounter between Trump and Biden.\n\nHarris and Trump are set to stage their own debate on September 10, hosted by ABC News, and the vice president has said she is open to looking at her opponent's suggestions for further showdowns.\n\nHarris's late entry into the race \u2013 replacing President Joe Biden after his withdrawal amid concerns over his age and unpopularity \u2013 has effectively turned it into the kind of sprint to election day more common in Europe. Already a trailblazer as the first female and first Black and South Asian vice president, Harris is aiming to make history as the first woman president \u2013 and is scrambling to pitch herself to the public ahead of November 5.\n\nShe and Walz head to the national convention in Chicago next week on the back of a blockbuster start, in which they have reversed Trump's polling leads, obliterated fundraising records and attracted huge ebullient crowds to their rallies. In almost all of the swing states that decide the contest in US elections, Harris is now level or ahead of Trump, who shocked the world with his 2016 presidential victory but was beaten by Biden in 2020.\n\nRead more Subscribers only Kamala Harris and Tim Walz launch campaign with a display of joy and strength in Philadelphia",

There was also no public record of the news outlet and the website\u2019s domain had only been set up in August 2024.\n\nEven though the original website was an obscure source, the video was still widely shared by social media accounts and it\u2019s estimated that it had millions of views.\n\nRussia has been linked to fake local news websites being used in the US to share disinformation that can cause confusion and increased political division. BBC Verify assesses that this video and the way it was spread has several hallmarks of a Russia-linked operation run by an ex-Florida cop they have investigated earlier.\n\nEarlier this year, Russia was also linked to disinformation that was being spread in the run-up to the Paris Olympics.\n\nYou can help to stop the spread of false information by pausing before you share and taking a closer look at details such as the source of the story, images used and any inconsistencies in the details.",

Weber, Ph.D., Announces Results of Randomized Alphabet Drawing for the November 5, 2024, General Election\n\n\n\nSacramento, Calif. \u2013 The California Secretary of State held a randomized alphabet drawing today to determine the order that candidates\u2019 names will appear on the November 5, 2024, General Election ballot.\n\nThe results of today\u2019s drawing are as follows:\n\nI F L T D E H Q M J G A Y R P C B V X K U N O W S Z\n\nThis alphabet applies throughout the candidate's name, last name first, followed, if necessary, by first name, then middle name. If more than one candidate's last name begins with the same letter, the alphabet applies to the second letter and, if needed, the third, etc., until different letters appear in the same position. For example, if two candidates with the last names Campbell and Carlson are running for the same office, their order on the ballot will depend on the order in which the letters \"M\" and \"R\" were drawn in the randomized alphabet drawing.\n\nToday\u2019s randomized alphabet drawing was held in the Elections Division of the Secretary of State\u2019s office in compliance with Elections Code section 13112. Staff pulled the letters in a lottery-style drawing, with witnesses from the press observing virtually.\n\nFor more information on upcoming 2024 General Election, click here: https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/upcoming-elections/general-election-nov-5-2024",

        "text": "Can Kamala Harris win over disenchanted Latino voters?\nThe abrupt substitution of Kamala Harris for Joe Biden as the Democratic party\u2019s presidential nominee has energized two of the party\u2019s bedrock bases of support \u2013 pro-choice women and African Americans \u2013 along with millions of young voters who felt dismay at the Hobson\u2019s choice posed by two old white guys in the presidential contest.\n\nBut the country\u2019s estimated 36 million eligible Latino voters could be another story.\n\nTheir importance in presidential races has been steadily growing over the past 50 years, and Latinos are projected to represent nearly 15% of eligible voters nationwide by November.\n\nHistorically, Latinos have ranked among the Democratic party\u2019s most reliable sources of votes, in about the same league as Black and Jewish voters. But the party\u2019s once commanding advantage has been shrinking. Hillary Clinton trounced Donald Trump among Latinos nationwide in 2016 by a factor of 81% to 16%, yet four years later the former president upped his share to one out of every four votes cast by Latinos.\n\nA slew of prominent Latino politicians and trade unionists have endorsed the vice-president since the president\u2019s withdrawal from the race on 21 July. They include some progressive Democrats who had condemned the terse message Harris had for would-be Latin American immigrants to the United States during a 2021 press conference in Guatemala City: \u201cDo not come.\u201d\n\nBut it remains unclear whether Latino voters overall will give Harris a big boost in her bid to defeat Trump. For starters, they are diverse in national origin as well as the circumstances and histories of their communities\u2019 immigration.\n\nMost southern California Chicanos reflect their state\u2019s liberal tendencies and have little in common ideologically with the majority of Miami\u2019s right-leaning Cuban Americans. Phoenix-based pollster Mike Noble notes that Latino voters whose roots go back to Colombia, Venezuela and other South American countries have been gravitating towards the Republican party over the past four years.\n\nLatinos are not yet digging deep into their pockets to support Harris. Two Zoom fundraising calls with Black women and men held on consecutive nights right after Biden bowed out brought in a total of $2.8m. Similar Zoom calls with Latinas and Latinos for Kamala on 24 and 31 July, respectively, posted a combined net haul of $188,000.\n\nAxios Latino has been tracking US Latinos\u2019 views of Harris in conjunction with Noticias Telemundo and the Ipsos market research and public opinion firm since the first year of the Biden administration. By the end of 2021, Axios Latino found that 48% of Latinos had a favorable opinion of Harris \u2013 but that figure had slumped to 39% by last March. A different survey of Latinos in 10 states found that sentiment persisted in Arizona and Nevada even days after Biden\u2019s fateful debate performance in late June.\n\nBut a more recent survey of 800 Latino voters living in seven swing states brought Harris and the Democrats some very welcome news. Carried out by the pollster Gary Segura on behalf of the Washington-based Somos Political Action Committee in the immediate aftermath of Biden\u2019s bombshell announcement, the survey gave Harris an impressive 18-percentage-point lead over Trump and surprisingly high favorability ratings among Latino voters in Arizona and Nevada, which have the highest percentage of eligible Latino voters among those swing states.\n\nIn a separate poll by Equis Research released Wednesday, Harris is still a few points short of Biden\u2019s support from Latino voters in the 2020 election, but is still leading Trump by 19 points among registered Latino voters in the seven most competitive states.\n\nHarris and her newly selected running mate, Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota, addressed rallies in Phoenix and Las Vegas late last week, and a new 30-second TV spot aimed at Latino voters has started airing in both English and Spanish.\n\n\u201cThroughout her career, she\u2019s always worked to earn the support of Latino voters and has made core issues like healthcare, childcare and fighting gun violence her focus,\u201d said the campaign\u2019s Hispanic media director, Maca Casado. \u201cVice-President Harris\u2019s campaign knows Latinos\u2019 political power, and we won\u2019t take their votes for granted.\u201d\n\nIn Harris\u2019s performance at the polls among Latinos in her native California, she garnered a majority of the Latino vote in both of her successful campaigns for the office of state attorney general, in 2010 and 2014.\n\nBut Latinos are not expected to play a decisive role in the Golden state or any of the other three states where they are most numerous. Both California and New York are widely considered to be a lock for Democrats, and the same is true of Texas and Florida for Republicans.\n\nThat leaves Arizona and Nevada, and the outlook for Democrats remains cloudy.\n\nCNN exit polling in November 2020 showed Biden beating Trump handily among Arizona Latino voters by a 27-percentage-point margin, thanks in part to folks like Matthew Sotelo. The 37-year-old leader of a non-profit community organization in Phoenix is a registered Democrat who thinks that Biden has done a \u201csolid\u201d job as president. But Sotelo senses a welcome change in the political climate since Harris became the party\u2019s standard bearer.\n\n\u201cThe energy is different, and despite what the polls say about Harris being in a dead heat with Trump, the momentum is swinging to her side,\u201d says the Arizona-born Mexican American.\n\nDuring Harris\u2019s abortive run for the presidency in 2019, Sotelo did have some reservations about her track record as a prosecutor in San Francisco who sought prison terms for people arrested for possession of small amounts of controlled substances. But he sees her as an open-minded politician.\n\n\u201cDo I think she has done a perfect job [on the border]? Absolutely not,\u201d says Sotelo. \u201cBut I understand there has been an opportunity for Harris to grow as a leader, and she\u2019ll continue to learn and grow.\u201d\n\nOne seasoned Latino pollster warns that Republicans have made major inroads in Arizona. \u201cThe Democrats have been losing ground there, and a lot of it has to do with the border,\u201d says Eduardo Gamarra, a Florida International University professor of political science who oversaw last month\u2019s poll of Latino voters in 10 states.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Born in the Mexican state of Sonora and a resident of Phoenix since 2000, the 42-year-old business consultant has spent his entire life on either side of the US-Mexican border.\n\n\u201cWe have so many people from different countries on the border every day, and Kamala has never tried to fix the situation on the border,\u201d says the registered Republican, who describes himself as a moderate in the mold of the late Arizona senator John McCain.\n\nGarcia\u2019s issues with Harris do not end with immigration. \u201cWe have so many problems with the Biden administration \u2013 inflation, Ukraine, Russia, Israel \u2013 and she is part of this administration,\u201d he says.\n\nDuring a campaign rally in Arizona last Friday, Harris drew attention to the years she served as California\u2019s attorney general. \u201cI went after the transnational gangs, the drug cartels and human traffickers,\u201d she declared. \u201cI prosecuted them in case after case, and I won.\u201d\n\nMike Noble, a former consultant and manager of Republican legislative campaigns in Arizona, found that many Latino voters in Arizona and Nevada are focused on pocketbook issues like inflation and housing affordability. Those anxieties are not likely to favor Harris.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s done a little better in places like the midwest and Pennsylvania, but in the sun belt, Harris is basically starting off in the same position as Biden was,\u201d he says.\n\nThe ascent of Harris has left David Navarro unmoved. The 27-year-old native of Las Vegas is a registered Democrat who supported Bernie Sanders\u2019 presidential bids in 2016 and 2020 and voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 general election. But he says he is done with both major political parties and will vote for Green party presidential candidate Jill Stein in the fall.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t support their views or any of their policies towards Israel and Gaza, and neither the Democrats nor the Republicans are doing anything to address the causes of inflation, which are corporations and their price increases,\u201d says the systems engineer whose father immigrated from El Salvador. \u201cThey don\u2019t value us as Americans, and I don\u2019t want a presidential candidate who is run by the major donors who are billionaires and the corporations.\u201d\n\nA scholar from the University of Nevada at Las Vegas (UNLV) cautions that many Latinos in that state, like millions of Americans across the country regardless of their race or ethnicity, do not know all that much about Harris at this juncture beyond her name and current job title.\n\n\u201cPeople know Biden and Trump, but when it comes to Harris, she has a lot more opportunity to shape the narrative, introduce herself and recalibrate things,\u201d says Rebecca Gill, UNLV associate professor of political science. \u201cShe has the potential to move her numbers more than Trump or Biden.\u201d\n\nIn a volatile election cycle already punctuated by an assassination attempt, a debate debacle of historic dimensions, and the nomination of the first Black female presidential candidate of a major political party, Latino voters could spring surprises of their own even in swing states with relatively small Latino populations.\n\n\u201cThe Hispanic vote is large enough in virtually every state in the US that it could make the difference between winning and losing, including Pennsylvania and Georgia,\u201d notes Fernand Amandi, a Miami-based Democratic pollster who specializes in tracking voting trends in the Latino community.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the very reason why so many people are hyper-focused on the Hispanic vote.\u201d",

        "text": "Golden doubles down on refusal to endorse a presidential candidate \u2022 Maine Morning Star\nDemocratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden hasn\u2019t endorsed a candidate for the upcoming presidential election \u2014 and he isn\u2019t going to.\n\nGolden released a statement Thursday evening reiterating that he will not be endorsing a candidate, adding that this will be his final comment in response to persistent questions about the presidential race, which has become a key criticism from his Republican opponent, Austin Theriault. The statement noted that Golden has never made an endorsement in a presidential election.\n\n\u201cLet me be as clear as I can be. I will not be endorsing in the presidential race,\u201d Golden said.\n\nThe congressman, who is up for reelection in Maine\u2019s 2nd Congressional District, said that he isn\u2019t endorsing anyone because he is running to represent all people in his district, regardless of who they pick for president.\n\n\u201cAs I have always done, I will fight for Mainers no matter who occupies the White House,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI am running to earn their vote on the merits, whether they support Harris, Trump, or none of the above. No matter who you vote for, there is room for you on Team Golden.\u201d\n\nThe statement comes a little more than a month after Golden penned an op-ed in the Bangor Daily News predicting that former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, would defeat President Joe Biden, who at the time was the Democratic candidate. Golden received pushback from Democratic lawmakers and community leaders who said his piece minimized threats to human rights and freedoms.\n\nSince that was published, Biden dropped his bid for reelection and the Democratic party \u2014 including others in Maine\u2019s congressional delegation \u2014 threw their support behind the now-Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris.",

        "text": "Where Harris and Trump stand on cryptocurrencies \u2014 and how it could sway some American voters\nDonald Trump\u2019s recent embrace of cryptocurrency at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville marks a significant shift from the former U.S. president\u2019s earlier skepticism.\n\nOnce a vocal critic, Trump now positions himself as a champion of digital assets, reflecting the broader convergence of politics and crypto in what is increasingly referred to as \u201cPolitiFi.\u201d\n\nBut even though Trump\u2019s pivot garnered significant attention, it\u2019s essential to explore how stances on cryptocurrency regulation could influence some voters in the United States leading up to the 2024 presidential election.\n\nBiden\u2019s evolving crypto stance\n\nHistorically, President Joe Biden\u2019s administration and prominent Democrats, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, have expressed concerns about cryptocurrencies, focusing on risks related to consumer protection, financial stability and the potential for money laundering.\n\nGary Gensler, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, has played a key role in this stance. He\u2019s advocated for treating many crypto assets as securities, thereby subjecting them to strict regulations similar to those governing stocks and bonds.\n\nBut the rising influence of cryptocurrencies has led to a shift within the Democratic Party. The passage of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) in May 2024 \u2014 with considerable support from Democrats \u2014 indicates a growing recognition of digital assets\u2019 importance. Despite the Biden administration\u2019s initial opposition to FIT21, there is now a willingness to work with regulators to develop a balanced regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, has not yet taken a definitive stance on crypto policy. But her campaign has engaged with crypto representatives, and there is increasing pressure from pro-crypto Democrats for her to adopt a more favourable approach.\n\nThis push is part of a broader effort to ensure that Trump does not dominate the crypto issue, which has become increasingly significant in the election due to its potential impact on campaign financing and voter engagement.\n\n(AP Photo/Charles Krupa)\n\nCompeting Democratic perspectives\n\nThe Democratic Party is divided on cryptocurrency regulation. While figures like Warren continue to emphasize the dangers of digital assets, others within the party are advocating for a more open approach.\n\nCongressman Brad Sherman, for instance, has expressed concerns that FIT21 could create a competitor to the U.S. dollar that might be exploited by criminals. On the other hand, pro-crypto Democrats are urging Harris to recognize the potential of digital assets and engage with the industry in a more constructive manner.\n\nThis internal debate within the Democratic Party reflects the broader tension between innovation and regulation. As cryptocurrencies gain traction, the challenge for the party is to balance these competing interests while safeguarding consumers and the financial system. Harris\u2019s stance on crypto regulation could determine whether wealthy industry leaders contribute to her campaign and could help mobilize younger, tech-savvy voters who are increasingly engaged with digital assets.\n\nThe establishment of Crypto4Harris, a group dedicated to enhancing Harris\u2019s appeal on cryptocurrency issues, underscores the importance of this topic in the upcoming election. The group\u2019s efforts, including organizing town hall events with high-profile supporters like billionaire Mark Cuban, aim to counter Trump\u2019s influence on the crypto issue and strengthen Harris\u2019s ties with the digital asset community.\n\nTim Walz, Harris\u2019s running mate, has not yet made a public statement on cryptocurrency, though his past interactions with the industry, including returning donations from FTX executives, suggest a cautious approach.\n\n(AP Photo/Julia Nikhinson\n\nTrump\u2019s transactional approach\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s embrace of cryptocurrency has been widely publicized, it is important to consider the context of this shift. Trump\u2019s newfound enthusiasm for digital assets could be more transactional than ideological, as much of his political activity is driven by opportunism.\n\nHis pivot to a crypto-friendly stance comes at a time when he is seeking to energize his base and attract campaign contributions from wealthy industry leaders who are heavily invested in the crypto space. This approach highlights the intersection of cryptocurrency regulation and campaign financing, with Trump trying to position himself to capture the financial support of the digital asset community.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that Trump is facing ongoing legal challenges, and his poll numbers are declining, raising questions about the sustainability of his political strategy. Nonetheless, his focus on cryptocurrency could appeal to younger voters who are engaged with digital assets.\n\nLong-term implications\n\nThe 2024 election is shaping up to be a pivotal moment for the future of cryptocurrency in the U.S.\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s embrace of digital assets has brought the issue to the forefront, there are broader political dynamics at play. Biden, Harris and other key figures are all grappling with how to approach this rapidly evolving industry.\n\nAs the lines between technology and politics continue to blur, the decisions made in the coming months will most likely have far-reaching implications for the future of digital assets and their role in the global economy.",

        "text": "Could the United States and China really go to war? Who would win?\nHere\u2019s something most Americans may be surprised to hear: military strategists in the United States consider China the nation\u2019s main military worry\u2014with the distinct possibility of a major U.S.-China war in the years to come. That is a terrifying prospect. The two countries are the world\u2019s top two economic and military powers, both armed with nuclear weapons, each contributing 15% to 20% to world gross domestic product, and each dependent on the other for its prosperity given the depth and breadth of their economic relationships. Were they to go to war, however, global prosperity might soon become the least of our concerns; World War III could not be ruled out, and the survival of the human race might even be on the line.\n\nA quick word of partial reassurance: I think that American military strategists tend to be, on average, slightly too hawkish on China, a country that some are calling part of a \u201cnew axis of evil\u201d that also includes Russia, North Korea, and Iran. I might agree that the latter three nations, or at least their current leaderships, should be viewed as fundamentally malevolent and dangerous. But China is a more complex case, having brought hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in recent decades, having done much for economic growth around the world in general, and showing a certain aversion to military risk (it has not gone to war since 1979, though it has skirmished against India and the Philippines in recent times). Perhaps military strategists are seeing things too darkly, even as they rightly sound the alarm on some of China\u2019s behaviors as well as its growing capacities and the ensuing risks to American interests. This backgrounder sketches out three different ways in which war pitting the People\u2019s Republic of China against the United States (and some number of its allies) might break out1:\n\nOver disputed islets and waters in the Western Pacific. With a Chinese attempt to invade and conquer Taiwan, a polity of 23 million people that Beijing considers a renegade province, followed by a U.S. decision to come to Taiwan\u2019s aid. With a more limited use of Chinese force against Taiwan, most likely involving some type of blockade of the island in an attempt to strangle and coerce it into capitulation and reunification.\n\nI find the first scenario the most likely to erupt, but the least likely to lead to all-out war. The last scenario causes me the greatest angst, based on a combined sense of its likelihood together with its potential for escalation both in the likely geographic zone of conflict and the potential use of nuclear weapons.\n\nLimited war in the Pacific: The South China Sea\n\nOne set of scenarios has become all too plausible in recent years: a skirmish between the Philippines and China as they pursue competing claims to certain islands, rocks, and other generally inconsequential features in the South China Sea. The problem is that ownership of even rather small islands can provide land for military bases, while also conferring large territorial seas and exclusive economic zones to the country able to establish possession. On top of that, China seems to want to control ship movements throughout the entire South China Sea, or at least maintain the right to veto those it doesn\u2019t like (such as those involving American aircraft carriers). A land formation called the Second Thomas Shoal is the most acute problem now; Manila (the capital of the Philippines) deliberately stranded an old ship on the shoal 25 years ago to assert its claim and keeps military personnel there all the time. In 2016, an Arbitral Tribunal constituted under the 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea ruled in the Philippines\u2019 favor given the proximity of inhabited Filipino islands to the shoal (meaning that the shoal is technically within the Philippines\u2019 exclusive economic zone). But Beijing rejects that argument. The United States has not ratified the convention upon which the tribunal based its decision, though it tends to accept its logic.\n\nChina has sometimes tried to impede the resupply of the Philippines\u2019 position. Earlier this year when it did so, two ships collided, and a Filipino sailor lost his thumb. Filipino President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. had earlier stated that were a Filipino to lose his or her life in such a future showdown, that could be seen as an act of war. The problem would be significant enough if it involved only China and another regional country (there are others in the region besides the Philippines mired in disputes with China over the ownership of various islands). But because the United States has a security treaty with the Philippines, it could feel obliged to intercede in defense of its ally in the event of an escalating crisis in the future, though the exact threshold of violence that would lead to American intervention has not been specified, nor of course has the nature or scale of any such hypothetical intervention.\n\nThe United States, in the event of worsening tensions, would probably have only a few options:\n\nAccompany a future Filipino resupply ship to the shoal and hope that China would choose not to press the issue.\n\nShoot back at any Chinese ship that shot at Filipino or American vessels.\n\nPlace its own personnel, at Filipino invitation, on the shoal and make it clear it will not only resupply them but defend them.\n\nChoose a non-military punishment of China, most likely in the economic realm.\n\nFortunately, none of these options seem likely to lead to all-out war, since it would be the height of irrationality and irresponsibility to let such a skirmish blow up into a major confrontation. Unfortunately, however, once the shooting starts and people start dying, it is hard to rule out worrisome escalatory dynamics. Most wars in human history are not accidental, but sometimes big wars do get sparked by small events, as with the assassination of the archduke of Austria-Hungary in Bosnia in June 1914, leading to World War I that August.\n\nAn attempted Chinese invasion of Taiwan\n\nMight China, tired of waiting for reunification since 1949 (when the Communist Party won China\u2019s civil war, and the losing Nationalists fled to Taiwan) invade the island to force its absorption into the mainland? Once done, it would be very hard to undo, to say the least (though the United States might support resistance forces in Taiwan even if China managed to get its military ashore in an attempt to control the island).\n\nIt would also be extremely dangerous for the region and the world because of the risk that the United States would respond militarily. The United States no longer has any treaty obligation to come to Taiwan\u2019s defense, as it did before Henry Kissinger and Richard Nixon began the great opening to China in the 1970s. But the United States has a law known as the (1979) Taiwan Relations Act declaring that it might well do so if a Chinese attack against Taiwan occurred in an unprovoked manner. The United States has historical bonds with Taiwan, having backed the Nationalists during the civil war and then during the Cold War, and since the Eisenhower administration, Washington has threatened to use force to defend Taiwan. (In earlier eras, American maritime and air supremacy over China\u2019s military was more lopsided than is the case today, making the task easier.) The United States has economic reasons to defend Taiwan, given that most of the world\u2019s best semiconductor chips are made on the island. And it has strategic reasons: Taiwan\u2019s fall could signal a China bent on regional aggression and expansionism\u2014whatever Beijing might say now about its aims being limited to what it defines as national reunification\u2014as well as a United States no longer as committed to the defense of friends and allies as it was once perceived to be. For these reasons, on as many as six occasions when asked, President Joe Biden has indicated an inclination to help defend Taiwan if China were to attack it (Biden gave no indication, however, about whether he would ask Congress for authorization).\n\nThe good news about deterring this war is that, for China, it would be a huge roll of the dice\u2014and I do not detect a recklessness or acceptance of high risk in the leadership of today\u2019s People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). There are, of course, different views about the nature of the China threat today, but few really argue that China would fail to carefully consider the costs and risks of any major military operation. President Xi Jinping is nationalist, assertive, and autocratic, but there is little to suggest he shares his friend Vladimir Putin\u2019s proclivity to use force for high-risk ventures. And this one would be very risky, since amphibious assault has become even harder than during World War II, given the proliferation of sensors that can detect big troop ships and many types of precision missiles as well as torpedoes (and drones) that can strike them. With some luck, Taiwan might itself be able to fend off the attack; with prompt American military aid, it would have a very good chance.\n\nThe bad news about this scenario, however, is that the United States still largely relies on large, fixed airfields (notably on Okinawa, Japan) and big ships (notably, aircraft carriers) to provide much of the firepower that would be used to counter such an attack. It also has fragile civilian infrastructure in the United States (ports, airfields, electricity grids, fuel distribution networks) that it would need to deploy, resupply, and control many of these military forces. These may all be vulnerable to Chinese preemption. Yes, the United States has attack submarines and long-range stealth bombers too, but China may conclude that America does not have enough. The PRC might also miscalculate America\u2019s ultimate willingness to risk World War III over what, in Beijing\u2019s eyes, may seem a relatively minor interest to the faraway United States. In other words, Beijing might, rightly or wrongly, construct a theory of relatively rapid victory that it comes to place great stock in.\n\nWhen war games are carried out to gauge how these scenarios might play out\u2014and who might win\u2014different games produce different results, even about the ultimate victor. Some have projected that the United States would ultimately succeed in helping Taiwan protect itself, though possibly losing many aircraft, ships, and tens of thousands of personnel in the effort. Other simulations have wound up predicting Chinese victories.\n\nMy own views can be condensed into three main points:\n\nThis is an extremely risky scenario for China. We can make it even riskier with the right kinds of additional military investments by Taiwan and the United States\u2014for example, unmanned or tilt-rotor aircraft operating off Okinawa\u2019s roads that do not require runways for launch and that can deploy sensors and shooters to the Taiwan Strait in the event of an invasion attempt, and that in some cases are numerous and inexpensive enough to be expendable without jeopardizing America\u2019s future military posture. Unmanned underwater vessels stationed permanently in the Western Pacific might play similar roles. If heaven forbid the scenario takes place anyway, even if China loses at first, we are still in trouble. There is little reason to think the war will simply then end. Beijing might then consider nuclear threats or retaliation, against Taiwan and/or the United States. It might also simply settle back into what I think is its best military and strategic option in the first place: a blockade, perhaps combined with cyberattacks and other forms of harassment or limited violence. The blockade, and related operations as well as American counters, might expand geographically to the Indian Ocean, the Persian Gulf, and beyond. It is to that latter type of scenario that I now turn.\n\n\n\nChina\u2019s best option: Blockade\n\nRather than undertake a cosmic roll of the dice and try to conquer Taiwan with an invasion, what if Beijing ratcheted up the kind of thing it has been doing of late\u2014sending missiles near Taiwan when it senses that leaders in Taiwan or the United States are trying to promote Taiwan\u2019s independence? For example, China fired a number of missiles into waters around Taiwan in August 2022 after then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi visited the island. That has created a \u201cnew normal\u201d of heightened Chinese military activity near Taiwan; next time it chooses to escalate, China could aim closer to shore. Perhaps it could take out a ship or two anchored in a port in Taiwan or destroy some shipping cranes in the harbor. Perhaps it could send 20 to 40 submarines out to sea and threaten to sink any commercial ship going in or out of Taiwan, unless that ship first docks in mainland China and allows its cargo to be inspected. Baby food and medicine might be allowed into Taiwan; anything smacking of military utility, or even high-tech goods crucial to Taiwan\u2019s economic relationships with the rest of the world, might not be.\n\nBeijing\u2019s goal with this kind of limited attack might be to target Taiwan\u2019s economy more than its people or even its military\u2014trying to coerce, through economic pain and threatened strangulation, while limiting any loss of life. Not only would the intensity of the operation be adjustable like a rheostat, but the operation could even be temporarily scaled back if and when too many American naval ships came to Taiwan\u2019s assistance to set up a safe shipping channel and break the blockade. Even if the United States and many core allies coalesced around the idea of a strong response (as Western nations did when the Soviets carried out the blockade of Berlin in 1948-1949), Beijing might hope that many neutral countries would overlook the relatively limited amounts of violence associated with this kind of operation and not join the U.S. coalition.\n\nI think this is the most credible scenario. It is also, I believe, very hard for the United States to counter. We can try to sink those Chinese submarines and shoot down those Chinese missiles, but the process will be slow, and we will take losses, too. I have attempted, through simple computations, to model how these scenarios might play out. Under certain plausible assumptions, I believe the United States plus Taiwan and probably Japan would win; under other equally plausible assumptions about the performance and survivability of missiles, missile defenses, surface ships, satellites, cyber systems, and other key assets, alas, I fear China could \u201cwin\u201d in the sense of sinking enough of our fleet needed for the counterblockade operation that we would have to call off the effort.\n\nOf course, whichever side loses round one may try again. The loser could, for example, rearm and then simply try again in a few years, or it could expand the conflict geographically, or it could even threaten the use of nuclear weapons (like Eisenhower did during the two Taiwan crises of the 1950s). There is little reason to think this scenario could be contained and little reason to think it would end soon\u2014even if one side or the other did seem to win at first. China would be unlikely to give up in trying to seize an island it considers rightfully its own, or to accept defeat at the hands of a country it considers its main rival. The United States, with its tradition of military assertiveness and strong devotion since the 1940s to the defense of allies, would likely see the stakes in any such war not simply as the fate of 23 million living in Taiwan, but the fate of its entire system of alliances and partnerships.\n\nThe single best way that the United States can more effectively deter a Chinese blockade of Taiwan, I believe, is to strengthen what Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has been calling integrated deterrence, a term I also coined in a 2019 book. It means working with allies to ensure that they too send a strong message of willingness to resist any Chinese attack\u2014not only with military responses but also with economic preparations that would make their nations more resilient in the event of a protracted economic war pitting the United States and its allies and partners against China.\n\nIt would, of course, really be much better not to fight any of these scenarios against China! The first is quite dangerous; the second and third are profoundly perilous. Deterrence is one part of the path forward for America, but so is a commitment to crisis management\u2014and, on some issues, even to compromise. Beijing, Taipei, and Washington all have crucial roles to play in this effort, since the irreducible objective must be to prevent a war that might not prove controllable\u2014and that could become the greatest tragedy in the history of the human race.",

        "text": "Ask an expert: Labor and the economy in the 2024 presidential election\nUNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. \u2014 Jobs and the economy are among the most important issues for voters during the 2024 presidential election, with interest rates, the cost of consumer goods and job availability at the tops of people\u2019s minds. Penn State News spoke with Kenneth Louie, associate professor of economics, Penn State Behrend, to learn more about the current state of the U.S. economy and the issues that the presidential candidates will need to address as they continue on the campaign trail.\n\nQ: What is the current status of the U.S. economy, and what actions could strengthen it?\n\nLouie: The U.S. economy is continuing to display remarkable resilience as reflected in three important economic indicators: employment; output, or the quantity of goods and services produced; and earnings.\n\nIn terms of employment, the economy added over 2.5 million jobs in 2023, an average of over 200,000 jobs per month on a seasonally adjusted basis. Job growth has continued throughout the first seven months of 2024, although the pace of that growth has slowed. Throughout 2023 and early 2024, the monthly unemployment rate remained below 4% on a seasonally adjusted basis, increasing only slightly to 4.3% in July.\n\nIn terms of output, the U.S. Gross Domestic Product \u2014 or the total value of goods and services produced, essentially a measure of the size of the country\u2019s economy \u2014 grew by 2.5% in 2023 and 2.8% by the second quarter of 2024, an improvement compared to the 1.9% growth in 2022.\n\nIn terms of earnings, the average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased by 3.6% in July compared to a year ago. The robust growth in average hourly earnings, combined with the slower 12-month increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), a measure of the average price of consumer goods and services, of 2.9% in July, implies that American workers, on average, are experiencing a modest increase in their real purchasing power.\n\nActions that could strengthen the U.S. economy include sound fiscal and monetary policies. On the fiscal side, government spending and taxation policies that enhance the productivity of the country\u2019s resources, balanced with careful consideration of the potential impact on the budget deficit and national debt, would be beneficial. Examples include policies designed to improve educational and health outcomes, increase investment in public infrastructure and promote innovation and entrepreneurship. In terms of monetary policy, continued adherence by the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) to its \u201cdual mandate\u201d of maintaining price stability and maximum sustainable employment for the economy would be beneficial. So far, the Fed seems to have achieved the elusive \u201csoft landing\u201d for the economy by slowing down the rate of inflation without inducing a recession. But the Fed will need to maintain continued vigilance in carrying out this difficult balancing act.\n\nQ: Will interest rates go up or down this year? What could the government do to guard against inflation?\n\nLouie: At its July meeting, the U.S. Federal Reserve decided to keep interest rates unchanged to try to get inflation under control. In general, lowering interest rates tends to stimulate the economy and potentially increase the rate of inflation, while raising interest rates tends to slow the rate of inflation. But Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has suggested that the Fed may begin to lower interest rates at their next meeting in September and may enact several interest rate cuts by the end of the year.\n\nThe Fed believes that it can begin to cut interest rates because it has made significant progress in bringing down the rate of inflation and because U.S. labor market conditions have begun to cool. The most recent data indicate that the 12-month rate of increase was 2.9% for the Consumer Price Index and 2.5% for the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, another measure of the prices people pay for goods and services. Both indices are slowly moving closer to the Fed\u2019s 2% target rate of inflation, which the Fed considers to be most consistent with its mandate of maintaining maximum employment and price stability. The pace of job growth has also slowed. Of course, the Fed is always careful to add that interest rate cuts will depend on whether additional inflation and employment data in the upcoming months will give them greater confidence that inflation is under control and the labor market is cooling down.\n\nEconomic theory and historical experience have taught us that the government can guard against inflation by avoiding excessive fiscal stimulus resulting from government spending and/or tax cuts, especially when the economy is at or close to its full potential level of employment and output, and avoiding excessive monetary stimulus resulting from increases in the money supply that exceed the economy\u2019s rate of growth. Additionally, government actions that boost the economy\u2019s productivity and aggregate output can help to guard against inflation.\n\nQ: How might \u201cshrinkflation\u201d and tax cuts affect voters?\n\nLouie: Inflation is one of the top issues on voters\u2019 minds as we approach the 2024 presidential election. Given the persistence of inflation during the past three years, some voters have expressed concern that companies have been engaging in unscrupulous practices such as \u201cprice gouging\u201d whereby prices are raised beyond what is necessary to offset higher costs, or packaging strategies resulting in \u201cshrinkflation\u201d whereby the amount or size of a product is reduced while the price remains the same.\n\nGiven this contentious issue, both presidential candidates have put forth proposals to help lower inflation. Democratic candidate Kamala Harris is expected to propose, among other recommendations, a federal government policy to restrict corporate price gouging. Former President Trump\u2019s policy proposals have included encouraging more domestic energy production to bring down the cost of fuel.\n\nSince inflation can impose significant financial hardship on American families, voters in the upcoming election are likely to scrutinize the different policy stances of the candidates to help keep inflation low.\n\nRegarding tax policy, tax cuts for individuals will increase the disposable incomes of voters. Typically, part of that extra disposable income will be spent on consumer purchases of goods and services and part of it will be saved. Since consumer spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of total spending in the economy, the increase in consumer purchases can potentially have a big impact on the economy. At the same time, the increase in savings made possible by the extra disposable income can help to finance additional investment in the economy. Consequently, with all else constant, most voters tend to favor tax cuts and prefer political candidates who pledge to cut taxes or at least avoid raising taxes.\n\nThe actual impact of tax cuts on the economy will of course depend on which specific taxes are cut, the size of the tax cuts, the distribution of the tax cuts across different income classes and whether the tax cuts are temporary or permanent. Over a longer period, tax cuts can have additional impacts such as inflation and higher interest rates resulting from high levels of aggregate spending, or future tax increases to offset government budgetary shortfalls.\n\nQ: How is the U.S. labor force doing?\n\nLouie: As of July, the total U.S. civilian non-institutional population, defined as people aged 16 and older who are not inmates and not on active duty in the Armed Forces, was 268.6 million. Of this total population, the size of the U.S. civilian labor force was 168 million. Therefore, the \u201clabor force participation rate\u201d in the U.S. is currently at 62.7%. Among those in the labor force, the number employed was 161.3 million and the number of unemployed was 7.2 million. Therefore, the \u201cemployment-population ratio\u201d is currently at 60.0% while the unemployment rate is at 4.3%.\n\nAlthough the labor force participation rate and the employment-population ratio are both higher compared to where they were during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, they are still below their pre-pandemic levels. And as noted above, the monthly unemployment rate has remained below 4% on a seasonally adjusted basis throughout 2023 and early 2024.\n\nSince labor resources play an essential role in the growth and vitality of the economy, actions to strengthen the quantity and quality of the U.S. labor force are important. For example, tax and regulatory policies that provide incentives or reduce constraints for participating in the labor force can increase the size of the labor force, while economic policies that promote investments in education and training can enhance productivity.\n\nQ: How will the growing unionization of labor influence the election?\n\nLouie: The number of workers represented by unions has grown in recent years, although the percent of wage and salary workers who are members of unions has remained relatively stable at about 10% in 2023.\n\nOne potential impact of the growth in the number of union workers is increased voter turnout. According to a report by the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation at the Harvard Kennedy School, \u201cunion members are significantly more likely than non-union members to vote in presidential and congressional elections, controlling for individual-level characteristics such as education, income and occupation\u201d as well as other political factors. Moreover, research suggests that there may be a \u201cspillover effect\u201d whereby citizens living in states with stronger unions are more likely to vote, controlling for demographic characteristics and political factors.\n\nThe impact of the growth in the number of union workers on the outcome of the upcoming presidential election is more difficult to ascertain. Historically, Democrats have received strong support from organized labor. Polling results from the Pew Research Center indicate that \u201ca majority (59%) of union members affiliate with the Democratic Party.\u201d Nevertheless, there are also indications that the Republican Party has succeeded in garnering some union support. For example, the president of the Teamsters Union gave one of the keynote speeches at the Republican National Convention. It is therefore somewhat uncertain how the growth in the number of union workers will ultimately influence the outcome of the election.\n\nFor more information or to speak with one of our election experts, visit media.psu.edu or contact mediarelations@psu.edu.",

        "text": "OAS Adopts Resolution on the Situation in Venezuela\nRemarks by\n\nAmbassador Francisco O. Mora\n\nOAS Permanent Council\n\nAugust 16, 2024\n\nThank you very much chair and good afternoon to everyone.\n\nDistinguished Representatives, colleagues, friends,\n\nToday, we come together at a critical moment for the people of Venezuela and for the values we hold dear in this hemisphere: democracy, respect for human rights, and the rule of law. The resolution before us is a testament to our collective commitment to these principles, and I urge its passage.\n\nThe July 28 election in Venezuela, and the events of the weeks since, demand a timely and clear response from this institution. We have seen numerous and credible reports of repression and violence, coupled with documented human rights violations and abuses, including arbitrary detentions. And we have seen an announced election result, lacking in detail, without supporting documentation, that runs contrary to abundant evidence collected by the media, civil society groups, and international organizations.\n\nIn such circumstances, the OAS cannot remain silent.\n\nFirst and foremost, the resolution before us today reaffirms our unwavering commitment to the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in Venezuela and in this hemisphere, as the document states. All States must promote universal respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. The rights to peaceful assembly and to take part in the conduct of public affairs without fear of reprisal must be guaranteed.\n\nThis resolution also calls upon the National Electoral Council of Venezuela to expeditiously release the detailed election results, including the \u201cactas\u201d, at the polling station level. We know that recently, the UN Panel of Experts released an interim report on the Venezuelan Presidential Election and found the National Electoral Council (CNE) had fallen short on transparency measures, national legal and regulatory provisions, and key post-electoral audits. The UN panel noted that all the publicly available vote tallies it reviewed \u201cexhibit all the security features of the original result protocols,\u201d indicating they are genuine.\n\nFinally, Mr Chair, a key conclusion found it is unprecedented in contemporary democratic elections that the announcement of the election came without the publication of its details or the release of tabulated results. Transparency in this process is not merely a procedural requirement; it promotes confidence in the results for the Venezuelan people. They deserve to know the true outcome of their votes\u2014an outcome that reflects their collective voice, free from manipulation.\n\nThe legitimacy of the electoral process\u2014and indeed, the future of Venezuela\u2014requires that verification be conducted without bias, and with utmost integrity.\n\nThe Venezuelan people have shown incredible resilience in the face of adversity. They have participated peacefully in the electoral process, and now they are entitled to a process that respects their sovereignty and honors their civil and political rights.\n\nAs we consider this resolution, I urge us all to speak with one voice in support of these fundamental freedoms. Let us show the people of Venezuela they are not alone\u2014that the nations of the Americas stand with them in their pursuit of justice and democracy.\n\nLet our unity be a powerful message to the people of Venezuela and to the world: that we here at the OAS are committed to upholding democracy, respect for human rights, and the rule of law in every corner of this hemisphere.\n\nMr chair I want to join you as well in commending and thanking everyone for the good faith negotiations, patient, flexible negotiations that went on over the past couple days. It was really a pleasure to be involved in and see the results of those negotiations. And lastly Chair I\u2019d like to thank you for your leadership guiding us through this process over the last several days. Thank you, Chair.\n\nCLOSING REMARKS\n\nThank you Mr. Chair. I know I\u2019ve had the opportunity to speak, but I didn\u2019t want to end the day without making specific reference, as some of my colleagues have, to the work we have done here.\n\nToday, the Organization of American States has demonstrated, once again, the power of unity and collective action. At this critical moment in our hemisphere, we, as the OAS, rose to the occasion.\n\nThe resolution we have just adopted is not merely a statement\u2014it is a powerful testament to our shared commitment to democracy, respect for human rights, and the rule of law. It is a resolution that speaks with one voice, not from a single country or region, but from across the entire Americas.\n\nThis resolution has co-sponsors from North America, from Central America, from South America, and from the Caribbean\u2014a demonstration that our hemisphere, though diverse in many ways, shares certain core values. Together, we here, the OAS, have demonstrated that when we act in unison, we can stand as a beacon of hope and justice for all.\n\nAnd today, we have done just that, Mr. Chair. By passing this resolution, we have sent a clear and unequivocal message to the people of Venezuela, and to the world, that the OAS stands firmly in support of democracy, transparency, and the human rights and fundamental freedoms of every individual.\n\nI want to take a moment to commend this institution.

        "text": "Kamala Harris and Donald Trump battle over US election\u2019s biggest issue\nTrump and Harris battle over election\u2019s biggest issue\n\nGetty Images\n\nAfter almost a year off the platform, Donald Trump returned to X this week and asked his 89 million followers: \u201cAre you better off now than you were when I was president?\u201d It was a clear echo of the famous quote from Ronald Reagan during his victorious 1980 presidential campaign, when he asked: \u201cAre you better off today than you were four years ago?\u201d This messaging isn\u2019t surprising. It seems like an obvious strategy for Trump to focus on the economy. That\u2019s because polls consistently suggest it\u2019s the issue American voters care about the most. One such poll conducted by The Economist and YouGov in recent days listed \u201cinflation/prices\u201d and \u201cjobs and the economy\u201d among voters\u2019 top concerns. Perhaps more importantly, polls also indicate voters are deeply unhappy with the current state of affairs. That seems like a perfect situation for any presidential challenger. But in an election that\u2019s been transformed by Kamala Harris taking over from Joe Biden as the Democratic candidate, Trump seems to be struggling to land his simple message on the economy. It is less than a month since he was on stage at the Republican National Convention looking unbeatable, having survived an assassination attempt and riding high in the opinion polls. Now, he has lost that lead and seems to have lost his way. Meanwhile, in the opposition corner, Ms Harris is riding a wave of excitement and enthusiasm that he is finding difficult to counter. The easiest way to burst her bubble would be to remind voters how unhappy they are about high prices and blame her for the inflation that has pushed up the cost of living during the time she has been beside President Biden in the White House.\n\nOne of the reasons Trump is failing to land that message is the Harris campaign\u2019s strategy of putting proposals to try to lower the cost of living at the heart of her pitch. In a speech in North Carolina on Friday, Ms Harris promised to expand child tax credits, help people to purchase their first homes, and to encourage the building of more affordable housing. She also said she hoped to tackle the persistently high price of food and groceries by banning \u201cprice gouging\u201d or excessive corporate profiteering. \"By any measure, our economy is the strongest in the world,\u201d she said. \u201cMany Americans don't yet feel that progress in their daily lives.\" Joe Biden and Kamala Harris ought to be able to boast about some very good economic indicators. There is strong growth, record levels of job creation, and this week the inflation rate fell below 3% for the first time during Mr Biden\u2019s presidency. But because prices are still high, voters don\u2019t feel any better off. Voters don\u2019t care about the rate of inflation \u2013 they care about the level of prices. \u201cA central banker wants inflation to get back to target. A shopper wants his or her old price back,\" Jared Bernstein, the chair of President Biden\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, said in a July speech. When it comes to the economy, \u201cthe vibes are off\u201d. \u201cVibes matter,\u201d Mr Bernstein said.\n\nThe policies from Democrats are \"hurting the working man\", says Jeff Tester\n\nSo will the bad economic vibes hurt the Harris campaign? That is what I asked voters over lunch at a crab shack on the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland. Jeff Tester, who works in a nearby marina, said high prices are really hurting him. \u201cI get paid by the hour. I get up to go to work every day. I think you have to do that to get the American dream,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I just know it's getting harder.\u201d And he is very clear about who he sees as responsible. \u201cI blame the Democrats. I believe their policies are hurting the working man,\u201d he said. Every diner I met complained about inflation, but not everyone held Mr Biden or Ms Harris responsible. Dan Nardo, a retired boat broker, said he believed the pandemic, oil prices, foreign wars and supply chain issues have more to do with price rises than the US president.\n\nRandy Turk isn't sure either presidential candidate will make much of a difference on inflation\n\nHis friend Randy Turk, a retired lawyer, told me that he felt a new administration is likely to follow a similar path to try to reduce inflation, regardless of who wins. \u201cIt's not like a different president can really make that much of a difference,\u201d he said. Ms Harris struggled for prominence and media coverage during most of her time as vice-president. Previously that was seen as a weakness. But if it means she can emerge untainted by \u201cBidenomics\u201d, it could be one of her greatest strengths. Ruth Igielnik, polling editor at the New York Times, says the latest data she has collected suggests \u201cvoters very much tied their negative feelings about the economy to Joe Biden\u201d. Talking to me on the BBC\u2019s Americast podcast, she explained that in her polling Trump is still favoured on the economy, but where he once had an 18-point lead over Mr Biden he now leads Ms Harris by only about 8 points. \u201cThat makes me think voters aren\u2019t necessarily attaching their feelings about the economy to her,\u201d she said. A separate poll this week conducted for the Financial Times and the University of Michigan Ross School of Business indicated Ms Harris holds a narrow lead over Trump on who Americans trust to handle the economy. No wonder Republicans are publicly begging Trump to focus on the issues, the economy in particular, and stop launching personal attacks against Ms Harris. In a speech this week, Trump told supporters he was going to talk about the economy but struggled to stay on topic. \u201cThey say it\u2019s the most important subject,\u201d he said, \"they\" referring to his advisers and strategists who believe this is his strongest line of attack. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it is. But they say it\u2019s the most important,\u201d he added, before going on to list immigration, crime and the way Ms Harris laughs as top issues. You could practically hear his campaign managers pulling their hair out. \u201cVoters don\u2019t care about personalities or who is drawing larger crowd sizes,\u201d said Matt Terrill, former chief of staff for Marco Rubio\u2019s presidential campaign. \u201cIndependent, undecided, swing voters in key states care about the economy and inflation so just focus on those core issues,\u201d he said. \u201cStay focused on talking about how you are going to make the lives of Americans better over the next four years.\u201d It was back in 1992 that the Democrat Jim Carville coined the slogan \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid\u201d while he was working on Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign. It\u2019s advice that every campaign since has clung to. But Trump, this time around, seems to be finding it uncommonly difficult to stick with. It ought to be a winner for him. After all, according to the Financial Times poll, in answer to his question \u201cAre you better off now than you were when I was president?\u201d only 19% of voters say they are.",

        "text": "What to know about the Democratic National Convention in Chicago\nDemocrats are rallying behind Kamala Harris and Tim Walz at the party convention, but protests over the Gaza war are also expected.\n\nIt has been a busy few weeks for Democrats in the United States.\n\nLess than a month ago, incumbent Joe Biden announced he was withdrawing from the 2024 presidential race amid concerns about his age and ability to defeat his Republican challenger and predecessor Donald Trump.\n\nSince then, Biden\u2019s Vice President Kamala Harris has emerged as the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential candidate, riding a wave of support from wide segments of the party base and members of Congress.\n\nHarris\u2019s selection of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz to be her vice-presidential running mate also galvanised Democrats and spurred tens of millions of dollars in new donations, according to her campaign.\n\nNow, the party is set to gather in Chicago for the Democratic National Convention, a tradition during presidential election years. Democrats hope the convention will serve as a strong show of unity, as party members coalesce behind the Harris-Walz ticket less than three months before Election Day.\n\nBut what exactly does the convention have in store this year? Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nWhat is the Democratic National Convention exactly?\n\nHeld every four years, the Democratic National Convention is a gathering to formally select the party\u2019s nominees for president and vice president.\n\nDemocrats also vote on the party\u2019s platform and other procedures, but the convention really serves as a way to drum up enthusiasm for the Democratic ticket.\n\nThis year\u2019s convention will begin on August 19 and run until August 22 in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nYes \u2014 but things are different this year.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee (DNC) announced on August 6 that Harris and Walz had been formally certified as the presidential and vice-presidential candidates, respectively.\n\nThat\u2019s because Democrats held a virtual roll-call vote earlier this month.\n\nDuring that roll call, Harris earned the support of a majority of Democratic delegates \u2014 people who typically cast votes for the presidential nominee at the convention based on primary and caucus results.\n\nNormally, the official roll-call vote happens at the convention. But this year, the party opted for a virtual roll call beforehand, because Democrats had raised concerns Harris could be left off ballots in Ohio due to a procedural issue.\n\nSo is a roll-call vote going to happen at the convention?\n\nAccording to the Democratic National Committee, yes.\n\nBut the committee says the vote will be \u201cceremonial\u201d since Harris and Walz have already been confirmed.\n\nConvention Chair Minyon Moore said on August 6 that Democratic delegates \u201cwill celebrate this historic ticket with a ceremonial roll call and tell the story of Vice President Harris, Governor Walz, and the Democratic Party as we prepare to defeat Donald Trump once again\u201d.\n\nTrump was officially confirmed as the Republican Party\u2019s candidate at the Republican National Convention in July. His running mate, US Senator JD Vance, was also named and confirmed at the convention last month.\n\nIt\u2019s official! I just signed the paperwork to certify Vice President @KamalaHarris for the ballot as our Democratic Party nominee for president. Let\u2019s make history this November! pic.twitter.com/Isymkud833 \u2014 Jaime Harrison (@harrisonjaime) August 6, 2024\n\nWhat else is on the schedule and who will be attending?\n\nAlongside the Democratic delegates and other party members, Democratic lawmakers are expected to take part in the four-day convention.\n\nWhile a full schedule of speakers has not yet been released, US media have reported that Biden, who endorsed Harris after he withdrew from the race late last month, will be the keynote speaker on the first night of the convention on August 19.\n\nHarris and Walz are also expected to deliver speeches. The vice presidential candidate will address the crowd on August 21, and the presidential candidate will close out the event on August 22.\n\nOrganisers estimate that about 50,000 people will descend on Chicago for the event.\n\nIs there anything else to expect?\n\nWhile Democrats have largely coalesced around Harris since she launched her push for the White House last month, she continues to face calls to break with the Biden administration\u2019s policies on Israel and the Gaza war.\n\nAs a result, Harris is expected to face large demonstrations on the sidelines of the convention, as protesters demand an end to the war and unconditional US support for Israel.\n\nFor months, protesters have demanded that Washington stop sending weapons to Israel as it bombards the coastal Palestinian enclave. The Israeli war has killed nearly 40,000 Palestinians and set off a humanitarian catastrophe.\n\nThe Coalition to March on the DNC, a coalition of activist groups, has planned marches on August 19 and August 22. \u201cDemocratic Party leadership switching out their presidential nominee does not wash the blood of over 50,000 Palestinians off their hands,\u201d it says on its website.\n\n\u201cBiden\u2019s entire administration, together with high ranking members of the Democratic Party from all over the country, has spent the last ten months wholeheartedly supporting the genocide in Gaza with our tax dollars,\u201d the coalition said.\n\n\u201cIt is a matter of historical urgency that all organizations who fight for the rights of working and oppressed people in the US join us in this demonstration to stand in solidarity with Palestine.\u201d\n\nChicago is home to one of the country\u2019s largest Palestinian American communities, and many locals are expected to take part in the marches.\n\nHave there been protests at other conventions before?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nOutside of last month\u2019s Republican National Convention, demonstrators took to the streets of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to denounce Trump and his Republican Party for their stance on abortion, the Gaza war and other issues.\n\nBut arguably the most well-known convention protest happened at the Democratic National Convention in 1968, also in Chicago.\n\nDemonstrators rallying for an end to the Vietnam War tried to march on the convention site but met a harsh crackdown by thousands of police, National Guard and other law enforcement officers.\n\nThe violence sowed chaos within the Democratic Party before that year\u2019s election, which was ultimately won by Republican Richard Nixon.",

        "text": "Harris has proposed a slew of economic policies. Here\u2019s a look at what\u2019s in them\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Vice President Kamala Harris is out with a string of new economic proposals focused on food prices, taxes, housing and medical costs that she says will empower the middle class.\n\nWATCH: Harris debuts economic proposals to lower costs for Americans\n\nThe plans constitute the first major policy proposals that Harris has released in the nearly four weeks since President Joe Biden bowed out of the race and endorsed his vice president.\n\nA look at what Harris is proposing:\n\nFood prices\n\nAfter years of polling showing that Americans are worried about inflation, Harris is aiming to contain prices where they have often been most conspicuously felt \u2014 at the grocery store. She\u2019s promising to, during her first 100 days in office, send Congress proposed federal limits on price increases for food producers and grocers. Harris also is seeking new authority for the Federal Trade Commission and attorneys general in states across the country to enact steeper punishments for violators. She also wants to use government regulators to crack down on mergers and acquisitions among large food industry businesses that the vice president argues have contributed to higher prices.\n\nHousing\n\nHarris is calling for the construction of 3 million new housing units over four years, which she says will ease a \u201cserious housing shortage in America.\u201d She also plans to promote legislation creating a new series of tax incentives for builders who construct \u201cstarter\u201d homes sold to first-time homebuyers.\n\nShe also wants a $40 billion innovation fund \u2014 doubling a similar pot of money created by the Biden administration \u2014 for businesses building affordable rental housing units. Harris also wants to speed up permitting and review processes to get housing stock to the market more quickly.\n\nWATCH: Why lower-income renters in Austin are struggling to find affordable housing\n\nHarris further says she can lower rental costs by limiting investors who buy up homes in bulk, as well as curbing the use of price-setting tools that she argues encourage collusion to increase profits among landlords. She also wants to expand a Biden administration plan providing $25,000 in potential down payment assistance to help some renters buy a home, so that it will include a much larger swath of first-time home buyers across the country.\n\nThe vice president also has endorsed repurposing some federal land to make room for new affordable housing, an idea that Biden endorsed while still running for president and that Trump has also spoken about favorably.\n\nTaxes and medical costs\n\nHarris wants to speed up a Biden administration effort that has allowed Medicare and other federal programs to negotiate with drugmakers to lower the cost of prescription medications, aiming to cut the price tags of some of the most expensive and most commonly used drugs by roughly 40 percent to 80 percent starting in 2026. She\u2019s also promised to promote competition with steps to increase transparency within pharmaceutical company pricing practices.\n\nREAD MORE: FDA says Florida can import prescription drugs from Canada\n\nHarris also pledged to work with state entities to cancel $7 billion of medical debt for up to 3 million qualifying Americans.\n\nThe vice president also proposed to make permanent a $3,600 per child tax credit approved through 2025 for eligible families, while offering a new $6,000 tax credit for those with newborn children. She says a Harris administration would work to expand the Earned Income Tax Credit to cut taxes for some frontline workers by up to $1,500 and reduce taxes on healthcare plans offered on the marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act.",

Quoting unnamed Trump critics, CNN has reported that the Republican candidate could be laying the groundwork to question the outcome of the 2024 election if he loses a second time. The former president continues to describe Kamala Harris 's elevation to her party's top ticket as \u201cunconstitutional\u201d. She has also accused her of taking part in a \u201ccoup\u201d and he may claim that her candidature itself is unconstitutional and she has no locus standi to claim the top office.Democratic Party will hold its national convention next week in Chicago. But much before that, the Democratic National Committee made an official announcement last week that Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz are the party nominees for president and vice president, respectively. Delegates held a virtual roll call ahead of the convention, where Kamala Harris received 99% support. Republicans know well that there is no way to challenge Harris\u2019s placement on ballots after the DNC vote. Talking to CNN, a person familiar with the Trump campaign\u2019s plans said that when the DNC nominated Kamala Harris, they were well within the timeframe to submit the required documentation to each of the states to place her name on the ballot.John Bolton, who was Trump\u2019s national security adviser and has since become a vocal critic of the former president, told CNN that if Trump is not declared the winner of the presidential election 2024, he would claim that it was so because he was treated unfairly yet again; it was stolen yet again.In an interview with Elon Musk on social media platform X, Trump said Harris\u2019s elevation was \u201ca scam\u201d. He also accused top Democrats of forcing Joe Biden out of the 2024 race. He also claimed that Biden did not want to step aside, then they said they can do it a hard way.John Bolton, who was Trump\u2019s national security adviser and has since become a vocal critic of the former president, told CNN that if Trump is not declared the winner of the presidential election 2024, he would claim that it was so because he was treated unfairly yet again; it was stolen yet again.In an interview with Elon Musk on social media platform X, Trump said Harris\u2019s elevation was \u201ca scam\u201d.

        "text": "Harris has two paths to victory \u2013 Rust belt or Sun belt, polling analysts say\nKamala Harris\u2019s surge in popularity since replacing Joe Biden as the Democratic presidential nominee has opened up a surprise second path to victory in November, according to a fresh analysis of recent voter surveys.\n\nAn aggregate of polls modelled by the Washington Post shows that the US vice-president has become newly competitive in four southern Sun belt states that were previously leaning heavily towards Donald Trump, the Republican nominee and former president.\n\nIf the trend holds, it means Harris could eke out an electoral college victory either by winning those states \u2013 Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and North Carolina \u2013 or, alternatively, by capturing three swing states in the midwestern Rust belt, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nTrump, by contrast, would need to capture both groups of states to earn the 270 electoral college votes necessary to secure victory, according to the model.\n\nThe opening up of a potential second front in Harris\u2019s pathway to victory may be the biggest boon yet from her elevation to the top of the Democratic ticket in place of Biden, whose only path to staying in office appeared to hinge on winning the three Rust belt states.\n\nHarris has gained an average of two percentage points nationally, and 2.1% in seven battleground states, since replacing Biden, who pulled out of the race on 21 July after weeks of intense pressure over a bad debate performance the previous month.\n\nThe transformation in the party\u2019s chances of retaining the White House amounts to a \u201creset\u201d of the election race and might even make Harris a \u201cslight favourite\u201d, according to the analysis. It is largely due to renewed impetus in key swing states under the candidacy of Harris and Tim Walz, the Minnesota governor who she chose as her running mate.\n\nThe outcome of US presidential elections is determined not by the popular vote, but by which candidate wins a majority of 538 electoral college votes, which are allotted state by state.\n\nPolls show many things, but in aggregate they appear to suggest that Harris now leads in the Rust belt states of Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and has closed the gap in another, Michigan, to within one point of Trump, the former president and Republican nominee. Biden won all three states, albeit by narrow margins, in 2020.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Amid Harris\u2019s recent surge, Democratic strategists have started to envision carrying the state, despite the party only having won it once in presidential elections since 1980.\n\nThe uptick in support makes her competitive in more states than Trump that would enable her to reach the required 270 electoral college votes.\n\nHowever, Harris still trails Trump in the final tally, if the polls are accurate and the election were held now.\n\nAnother boon to Harris is a Washington Post/Ipsos poll that shows her choice of Walz as running mate playing better with voters than Trump\u2019s selection of JD Vance, who has seemed to hit trouble with female voters because of his hardline anti-abortion views and track record of misogynistic comments about childless women.\n\nThe survey showed 39% of voters having a favourable view of Walz \u2013 who has been targeted by Republicans because of his left-leaning policies as Minnesota governor \u2013 and 30% unfavourable, giving him a positive rating of 9%. Vance, on the other hand, recorded a 32% favourable rating against 42% who saw him unfavourably, a negative rating that chimes with other polls, some of which have measured him as the most unpopular vice-presidential pick in history.\n\nReflecting her campaign\u2019s bullishness about its prospects in the state as it approaches next week\u2019s Democratic national convention, Harris was due to make a keynote economic speech in Raleigh, North Carolina, on Friday where she was expected to set out policies on price gouging, rising food prices and high housing costs. All are areas that Republicans see as potential vulnerabilities for Harris.\n\nVance, a senator for Ohio, was due to speak in the Wisconsin city of Milwaukee, following appearances in Pennsylvania and Michigan in recent days, mirroring the Trump campaign\u2019s recognition of the need to win the states.",

        "text": "What a Kamala Harris presidency could mean for electric vehicles\nWhat a Kamala Harris presidency could mean for electric vehicles\n\nOn the road to the 2024 presidential election, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump's views on electric vehicles (EVs) have offered two different visions of America's automotive future.\n\nHarris has been vocally supportive of the administration's push to expand access and manufacturing of EVs in the U.S., while Trump has pledged to undo those policies.\n\nEarlier this week, however, Trump appeared to soften his staunch anti-EV views when he spoke to Tesla CEO Elon Musk on X.\n\n\"You do make a great product,\" Trump said to Musk, referring to Tesla vehicles. \"That doesn't mean everybody should have an electric car, but these are minor details ... your product is incredible.\"\n\nA Tesla car charges up at a Tesla Supercharger, May 2, 2024, in Petaluma, Calif. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images, FILE\n\nBefore his conversation with Musk, the former president had maintained that electric vehicle production and sustainable energy sources are bad for the economy. He has vowed on \"day one\" to repeal the Biden-Harris administration's sustainable energy policies in favor of domestic oil production.\n\n\"I will end the electric-vehicle mandate on day one, thereby saving the U.S. auto industry from complete obliteration,\" Trump told the audience at the Republican National Convention in July.\n\nBiden-Harris pro-EV policies\n\nWhile there is no federal electric vehicle mandate, the Biden-Harris administration has issued regulations calling on automakers to reduce emissions produced by their fleets, including by producing more electric and hybrid vehicles.\n\nThe administration's 2022 Inflation Reduction Act \u2013 which Harris cast the tie-breaking vote to pass in Congress \u2013 marks the largest climate investment in United States history.\n\nThe legislation aims to reduce U.S. carbon emissions by 40% by 2030 and channels $370 billion into wind, solar, battery and electric vehicle production over the next 10 years.\n\nThrough the Inflation Reduction Act, candidate Harris has advocated for substantial investments in domestic electric vehicle car manufacturing, including funding for charging stations, and offering consumer incentives to buy EVs.\n\nIn May, Harris traveled to Detroit, Michigan, where she announced $100 million for small- and medium-sized auto manufacturers to upgrade their facilities for EV production.\n\nWorkers assemble second-generation R1 vehicles at electric auto maker Rivian's manufacturing facility, June 21, 2024, in Normal, Ill. Joel Angel Juarez/Reuters\n\n\"This investment will help to keep our auto supply chains here in America,\" Harris said then, \"which strengthens America's economy overall and will keep those jobs here in Detroit.\"\n\nIf elected, Harris is expected to continue advocating for eco-friendly fuel and emissions standards, increase funding for research and development for EV technology, and focus on leveraging EV industry growth to create more jobs.\n\nAn ABC News request to the Harris campaign for comment about their EV plans was not immediately returned.\n\nEV sales impact on economy, climate\n\nMore Americans are starting to embrace EVs. Sales of electric cars and trucks last year totaled 1.4 million in 2023, up from 1 million in 2022, U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm announced in January.\n\n\"The progress that's been made is phenomenal,\" Albert Gore III, executive director of the nonprofit coalition Zero Emission Transportation Association, told ABC News. \"The United States has been a leader in electric vehicle manufacturing and also has really been a leader in a lot of good policymaking with regard to investment in every part of the EV and battery supply chain.\"\n\nGore also noted that electric vehicles can have a significant impact on the economy, saying, \"There's a huge amount of opportunity.\"\n\nThe industrial Midwest, Southwest and Southeast already have seen investment and job opportunities in the production of minerals and battery components for EVs. Georgia, Nevada, Texas, Ohio and Kansas have grown as domestic hubs for battery manufacturing, while Georgia, Tennessee, Ohio and Arizona have risen as leaders in EV manufacturing.\n\n\"So a lot of really exciting economic opportunity in these places, and oftentimes it's multiple parts of the supply chain,\" Gore added.\n\nLast month, the Biden administration awarded nearly $2 billion in grants to General Motors, Stellantis and other automakers to expand electric vehicle manufacturing in eight states, including key election swing states Michigan, Pennsylvania and Georgia.\n\nVice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris speaks during a campaign event with Democratic vice presidential candidate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, at the United Auto Workers (UAW) Local 900 in Wayne, Mich., Aug. 8, 2024. Elizabeth Frantz/Reuters, FILE\n\n\"It's really important that we create a transportation system where our cars are made by union workers with good jobs, which we're starting to do courtesy of the Biden-Harris Inflation Reduction Act,\" Craig Segall, former deputy executive officer of the California Air Resources Board and current vice president of Evergreen Action, a nonprofit climate change advocacy group, told ABC News.\n\n\"We must stabilize the climate and America should lead that effort,\" Segall added.\n\nSegall believes a Harris-Walz White House promises a continuation of the Biden administration's push for EV manufacturing, and a chance to further those goals.\n\n\"When I think about what we could have at the end of her first term, I think we're talking about much clearer skies and much healthier communities,\" Segall said.\n\nBecause they have zero emissions, electric vehicles typically have a smaller carbon footprint than gasoline cars, even when accounting for the electricity used for charging, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nObstacles to EV sales in the U.S.\n\nDespite the push by carmakers and government officials, the EV market in the U.S. is still small compared to sales of gas-powered vehicles. Of the roughly 286 million cars on the road in 2023, just 9.3% were electric vehicles, according to Experian Automotive's Market Trends report.\n\n\"The EV market is currently going through a bit of a rough patch,\" Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds, told ABC News.\n\nCaldwell explained that consumers' hesitancy to buy electric vehicles largely surrounds the charging infrastructure, range, prices, and battery longevity.\n\n\"In order for its buyer base to evolve from early adopters to mainstream consumers, EVs will likely rely on continued government support to hit volume sales targets across all brands,\" Caldwell said. \"Even with the enthusiastic backing of a fresh presidential administration, enacting such a dramatic shift in the vehicle market is a massive undertaking and the politically charged rhetoric surrounding EVs will likely place extra pressure on any new policy decisions.\"\n\nIn order to combat consumer hesitancy, electric vehicles need to be offered at every price range, according to Alan Jenn, an assistant professor at the UC Davis Institute of Transportation Studies.\n\nTesla vehicles charge at a Tesla Supercharger station, Jan. 13, 2023, in Santa Monica, Calif. Eric Thayer/Bloomberg via Getty Images, FILE\n\n\"In order to see EVs get even more mainstream than they are now, we want to see a larger release of vehicles in segments that are more affordable,\" Jenn told ABC News.\n\nThe average transaction price for electric cars in June 2024 was $56,371 versus gas-powered vehicles at $48,644, according to Kelley Blue Book.\n\nSegall believes a Harris presidency could bring federal investments and further tax credits to lower the costs of EVs.\n\nCurrently, the government offers tax credits up to $7,500 for eligible new electric vehicles and up to $4,000 for eligible used electric vehicles, according to the Department of Energy.\n\n\"They're really well placed to stop paying for gas forever right now, and that's only going to be a better story,\" Segall said.",

        "text": "August 16, 2024, presidential campaign news\nSen. JD Vance speaks at a campaign rally at VFW Post 92 in New Kensington, Pennsylvania, on Thursday. Getty Images\n\nDemocratic members of Congress who served in the military have signed an open letter defending Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz\u2019s military service record and calling Ohio Sen. JD Vance\u2019s attacks on Walz \u201cbeyond the pale,\u201d according to a copy of the letter obtained by CNN.\n\nThe letter, signed by 19 Democratic veterans in Congress and coordinated by Navy veteran Rep. Mikie Sherrill, praises Walz\u2019s \u201cethos and leadership\u201d and his work as a former member of Congress and governor on behalf of veterans. The letter also attacks Vance, who served in the Marine Corps, for calling Walz\u2019s military service into question.\n\n\u201cIn the military, we all learned to respect and defend our fellow service members. While we might disagree with their policy proposals, we would never question their motives. We would never say that person doesn\u2019t love America,\u201d the letter states. \u201cBut that\u2019s exactly what JD Vance did this week. And even worse, his attacks were purely politically driven.\u201d\n\n\u201cFalsely maligning a fellow veteran\u2019s service for personal gain is beyond the pale,\u201d it continues.\n\nThe letter goes on to highlight former President Donald Trump\u2019s previous comments disparaging military service members, calling those comments \u201ca disgrace,\u201d and urging Vance to cease criticizing Walz\u2019s military service.\n\nThe letter was signed by Democratic Sens. Tom Carper, Tammy Duckworth, Mark Kelly, Gary Peters and Jack Reed, along with Democratic Reps. Jake Auchincloss, Salud Carbajal, Jason Crow, Christopher Deluzio, Ruben Gallego, Chrissy Houlahan, Ted Lieu, Seth Moulton, Jimmy Panetta, Pat Ryan, Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan, Bobby Scott, Mikie Sherrill and Mike Thompson.\n\nIt comes in response to Vance and Republican allies accusing Walz of misrepresenting his service record, highlighting a video of a 2018 campaign event in which Walz said he carried weapons \u201cin war.\u201d Vance said that quote amounted to \u201cstolen valor.\u201d The Harris campaign said in a statement following the attacks from Vance that he \u201cmisspoke.\u201d\n\nVance has also falsely accused Walz of dodging an overseas deployment. Walz served for 24 years in the Army National Guard before retiring to run for Congress in 2005. Shortly after he retired, Walz\u2019s unit received notification they would deploy to Iraq.\n\nVance response: Vance spokesperson Luke Schroeder responded in a statement to CNN, repeating those claims:\n\n\u201cJust as Tim Walz should be thanked for his service, he should also be criticized for choosing to launch his own political career over going with his unit to Iraq, repeatedly embellishing his rank and record, falsely claiming to have carried a weapon of war \u2018in war,\u2019 and failing to correct the record in the multiple instances he was falsely identified as a combat veteran. The Trump-Vance administration will be the most pro-veteran and pro-military administration in history.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Kit Maher contributed reporting to this post.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this post included an incorrect list of signatories. It has been updated.",

        "text": "Election 2024: Inside California\u2019s ballot propositions \u2014 USC News\nWhen Californians head to the polls in November, they won\u2019t just cast their votes for the next president and congressional representatives; they\u2019ll also make decisions on key policy issues like affordable housing, the environment and upgrades to public schools.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s system of direct democracy has enjoyed widespread support among voters since the state adopted the statewide initiative, referendum and recall processes in 1911. Since 1974, California voters have reviewed over 500 propositions on statewide ballots, including measures that forced businesses to place health warning labels on products known to cause cancer, provided supportive housing for homeless people and funded arts education in K-12 schools.\n\n\u201cCalifornia continues to be the national leader in allowing citizens to use ballot measures to resolve important state issues, with a healthy 10 issues on the ballot at this time,\u201d said John G. Matsusaka, executive director of the Initiative and Referendum Institute at USC, which studies and tracks ballot initiatives and propositions nationwide. \u201cAs is the case in almost every election, there are some important issues on the ballot for the voters to decide.\u201d\n\nHow California\u2019s ballot propositions work\n\nIn California, measures generally make it to the ballot in one of two ways: through the legislature, which can propose amendments to the state constitution or secure bond funding for projects, or via citizen-led petitions that directly place issues on the ballot.\n\n\u201cOn a typical ballot, most of the propositions are placed on the ballot by the legislature. This year, five of the 10 propositions currently set for the ballot came from the legislature and five came from citizen petitions,\u201d said Matsusaka, the Charles F. Sexton Chair in American Enterprise at the USC Marshall School of Business and the USC Gould School of Law.\n\nMatsusaka explained legislative propositions appear on the ballot because the California Constitution mandates that bond issues and constitutional amendments must be approved by voters. In contrast, propositions from citizen petitions, known as \u201cinitiatives,\u201d are efforts to bypass the legislature and directly address issues proposed by the public.\n\n\u201cGroups typically sponsor initiatives after they fail to persuade the legislature to pass a law they want, in an effort to go over the heads of elected officials to the final authority, the people,\u201d he said.\n\nCALIFORNIA BALLOT MEASURES: Q&A WITH JOHN MATSUSAKA\n\nMatsusaka, a political economist and expert on direct democracy, discusses the key statewide ballot measures voters will decide on in November.\n\nProposition 2: A game-changer for public schools \u2014 and housing\n\nOne of the most notable measures, Proposition 2, proposes issuing $10 billion in bonds to fund the modernization of California\u2019s public education facilities. Of this amount, $8.5 billion would be allocated to elementary and secondary schools, while $1.5 billion would support improvements at community colleges.\n\n\u201cThe two school construction bond measures on the California ballot in November are essential for ensuring that every student in the state has a safe and up-to-date place to attend school every day,\u201d said Lawrence Picus, the Richard T. Cooper and Mary Catherine Cooper Chair in Public School Administration at the USC Rossier School of Education.\n\nPicus noted many school facilities are over 50 years old and require significant upgrades to meet current technological and educational needs. \u201cThese funds will help transform classrooms and schools into environments where all our children can thrive,\u201d Picus said.\n\nIn addition to upgrading schools, experts say Proposition 2 might also address the critical housing shortage for educators.\n\n\u201cProp. 2 is also likely to be used by some school districts to support efforts to develop housing for teachers and staff. While this might seem like an unusual expansion of the responsibilities typically taken on by school districts, the critical housing shortage in California has made it necessary,\u201d said Pedro Noguera, dean of USC Rossier.\n\nProposition 2 isn\u2019t the only measure aimed at improving housing. Proposition 33 would eliminate a state law prohibiting cities from limiting rental rates on single-family homes, and Proposition 5 would make it easier for cities to borrow money for affordable housing by reducing the number of votes needed to approve housing and infrastructure bonds, with the caveat the money won\u2019t be used to buy single-family homes.\n\nProposition 4: Weighing the costs, benefits of California\u2019s most ambitious environmental proposal yet\n\nProposition 4 proposes borrowing $10 billion for a range of critical environmental projects, including flood control, water infrastructure, wildfire management and parks. Experts have expressed concerns about its complexity, arguing the bundled nature of the measure could make it difficult for voters to assess each component.\n\nMatthew Kahn, an economic expert on climate change policy and urban quality of life, pointed out several key concerns: the financial impact on middle- and low-income residents, the distribution of benefits across different regions in California and the anticipated improvements in environmental quality.\n\n\u201cWhen we go to a restaurant, we can construct our own meal based on choosing which courses we want to eat. In contrast, this proposition resembles a fixed price, fixed menu meal,\u201d said Kahn, provost professor of economics and spatial sciences at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences.\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t the authors propose a separate ballot initiative for each of the ballot\u2019s pieces? There could be a separate vote on flood control and on investing in parks. Under these rules, voters could better prioritize which of these environmental items they care the most about,\u201d he said.",

        "text": "VP debate hosted by CBS News set for Oct. 1 between Vance and Walz\nWashington \u2014 The vice presidential debate hosted by CBS News is set for Oct. 1 in New York City, with Democratic Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota and GOP Sen. JD Vance of Ohio both agreeing to participate.\n\nThe debate will be moderated by \"CBS Evening News\" anchor and managing editor Norah O'Donnell and \"Face the Nation\" moderator and CBS News chief foreign affairs correspondent Margaret Brennan.\n\nOn Wednesday, CBS News proposed four dates for a debate between the two vice presidential nominees: Sept. 17, Sept. 24, Oct. 1, and Oct. 8. The Harris-Walz campaign soon agreed to the Oct. 1 date.\n\n\"See you on October 1, JD,\" Walz wrote on X. A campaign official said Walz \"looks forward to debating JD Vance \u2014 if he shows up.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Vance posted on social media that he accepted the CBS News debate on Oct. 1, and said he also wanted to debate on CNN on Sept. 18.\n\n\"The American people deserve as many debates as possible, which is why President Trump has challenged Kamala to three of them already,\" Vance wrote on X. \"Not only do I accept the CBS debate on October 1st, I accept the CNN debate on September 18th as well. I look forward to seeing you at both!\"\n\nIn the afternoon, Michael Tyler, the communications director for Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign, said Walz will only participate in the CBS debate on Oct. 1. He also reiterated Harris intention to debate Trump on Sept. 10, and said she would agree to one more meeting sometime in October.\n\nThe vice presidential debate\n\nSen. JD Vance, left, and Gov. Tim Walz. Getty Images\n\nA date for the vice presidential debate has been in limbo since the spring, when CBS News first extended the invitation to both presidential campaigns. In May, President Biden's campaign said Harris, who was still his running mate at the time, was willing to face off against the eventual Republican vice presidential nominee on either July 23 or Aug. 13.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump picked Vance as his running mate on July 15, the first day of the Republican National Convention. His campaign soon declined to commit to a vice presidential debate before the Democratic National Convention on Aug. 19, saying that doing so would be premature since Harris might end up being the Democratic nominee.\n\nMr. Biden dropped out of the race on July 21, several weeks after his own poor showing at his debate with Trump. Harris quickly gathered the support needed to replace him atop the Democratic ticket and formally captured the nomination last week. She named Walz as her running mate, finalizing the vice presidential picks for both campaigns and kicking off a sprint to the election in November.\n\nLast week, Trump said CBS News would host the vice presidential debate, and that Vance has \"really stepped up\" and is \"doing a fantastic job.\" He added that he was willing to participate in three debates with Harris in September, hosted by Fox News, ABC News and NBC News.\n\nThe Harris campaign initially committed to one debate, the Sept. 10 meeting on ABC. The Thursday statement from Tyler, Harris' communications director, indicated she was open to one more the following month, saying \"the American people will have another opportunity to see the vice president and Donald Trump on the debate stage in October.\"\n\n\"The debate about debates is over,\" Tyler said. \"Voters deserve to see the candidates for the highest office in the land share their competing visions for our future. The more they play games, the more insecure and unserious Trump and Vance reveal themselves to be to the American people. Those games end now.\"\n\nThis year is the first election cycle since 1988 in which the debates are not being organized by the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates. In 2022, the Republican National Committee voted to ban GOP nominees from participating in debates hosted by the commission, accusing the organizers of bias in the two 2020 meetings between Mr. Biden and Trump.\n\nInstead, television networks have been left to negotiate dates and terms for the debates directly with the presidential campaigns. CNN hosted the first debate of the cycle between Mr. Biden and Trump in June, a much earlier start than in previous election years. CNN allowed other networks to carry the debate on their airwaves, in keeping with the practice for debates hosted by the commission.",

        "text": "10 facts about Democrats in the U.S.\nThe Democratic National Convention logo is displayed at Chicago\u2019s United Center on Jan. 18, 2024. The convention is scheduled to be held there Aug. 19-22, 2024. (Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nAs the Democratic Party prepares to open its national convention in Chicago and nominate Vice President Kamala Harris for president, here are 10 key facts about the roughly half of registered voters who identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party, according to Pew Research Center data.\n\nHow we did this This Pew Research Center analysis focuses on Democrats\u2019 demographic characteristics and key political attitudes ahead of the 2024 Democratic National Convention. The public opinion data in this analysis comes from several recent Center surveys. Links to these surveys, including details about their methodologies, are available in the text.\n\nThe racial and ethnic composition of Democratic voters has changed a lot in recent decades. More than four-in-ten Democratic voters (44%) are Hispanic, Black, Asian, another race or multiracial. This is roughly double the share in 1996 (23%).\n\nBy comparison, while Republicans are also more racially and ethnically diverse than in the past, the change among Republicans is less pronounced. About eight-in-ten Republican voters (79%) are non-Hispanic White.\n\nThe share of Democratic voters with at least a four-year college degree has roughly doubled since the 1990s. The increase in voters with a college degree has been sharper among Democrats than among Republicans.\n\nToday, 45% of Democratic voters have at least a bachelor\u2019s degree, up from 22% in 1996. Among Republicans, the change has been more modest: 35% of GOP voters have at least a four-year college degree, compared with 27% in 1996.\n\nWhite Americans without a four-year degree made up a majority of Democratic voters in the 1990s. Today, they account for just 26%.\n\nRelated: 10 facts about Republicans in the U.S.\n\nReligiously, nearly half of Democratic voters (46%) identify as something other than Christian. Like the broader U.S. population, registered voters have become less religious and less Christian in recent decades. These changes have been much more evident among Democratic than Republican voters. The share of Democratic voters who are religiously unaffiliated has roughly doubled since 2008, from 18% to 38%.\n\nJust a few decades ago, Christians made up an overwhelming majority of Democratic voters. Today, slightly more than half of Democrats (54%) are Christian, while 46% are not.\n\nHarris draws more support from Democratic voters \u2013 and considerably more strong support \u2013 than President Joe Biden did. Nine-in-ten Democratic voters say they would vote for Harris if the election were held today, including 58% who strongly support her. Another 5% of Democratic voters favor independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and 4% favor former Republican President Donald Trump, according to a new Pew Research Center survey.\n\nShortly before he withdrew from the presidential race on July 21, Biden drew support from 79% of Democratic voters. And only about a third of Democratic voters (35%) said they supported him strongly. That is 23 percentage points lower than Harris\u2019 current level of strong support among Democratic voters.\n\nMost Democratic voters (66%) say they are \u201cextremely\u201d motivated to vote this fall. This is 10 points higher than the share who said this in early July.\n\nOver the same period, there has been a similar increase in the share of Republican voters who say they are extremely motivated to vote, from 59% in July to 68% today.\n\nMajorities of Democrats say gun violence, health care costs and partisan gridlock are major national problems. In a May 2024 survey of U.S. adults (not just registered voters), 68% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said gun violence is a very big problem in the country today. The affordability of health care, the ability of parties to work together and climate change also ranked among the most serious national problems for Democrats.\n\nBy comparison, Republicans are far less likely than Democrats to view several of these issues as major problems.\n\nDemocrats continue to favor an active federal government. Americans are evenly divided in their preferences for the size of government. Around half (49%) say they favor a smaller government that provides fewer services, while about as many (48%) favor a bigger government with more services.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 preference for a bigger, more active government has been evident for decades. But the share of Democrats who prefer a bigger government that provides more services has increased from 59% in 2015 to 74% today.\n\nMost Democrats (76%) also say the government should do more to solve problems. Just 23% say it is doing too many things that are better left to individuals and businesses.\n\nWhile Democrats broadly support the federal government providing more services, their level of trust in the federal government \u2013 like the public\u2019s overall \u2013 has decreased sharply since the 1970s. Only about a third of Democrats (35%) say they trust the federal government just about always or most of the time. Still, that is roughly three times the share of Republicans who say this (11%).\n\nDemocrats overwhelmingly say abortion should be legal. Among the U.S. public overall, 63% say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, up 4 points since 2021.\n\nWhile Democrats have long supported legal abortion, the share who say it should be legal in all or most cases has increased over the past decade, from 65% in 2014 to 85% today. By 73% to 8%, Democrats also say medication abortion should be legal in their state. Opinions of medication abortion among Republicans are more divided: 37% say it should be legal in their state, 32% say it should be illegal and 30% aren\u2019t sure.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 views of the Supreme Court have grown much more negative. The share of Democrats who have a favorable opinion of the Supreme Court plummeted after it overruled the Roe v. Wade decision in 2022, which had guaranteed a constitutional right to an abortion for nearly 50 years.\n\nToday, just 24% of Democrats have a favorable opinion of the court \u2013 among the lowest ratings from either party over the past 30 years.\n\nA majority of Democrats also say the court is too powerful. Currently, 62% say this, up from 40% shortly before the court overturned Roe.\n\nDemocratic hostility toward the Republican Party has risen in recent decades. Over the past several decades, both Republicans and Democrats have become more likely to view the opposing party very unfavorably: 55% of Democrats say this about the Republican Party, up from just 17% three decades ago.\n\nDemocrats also overwhelmingly dislike Trump. Currently, 92% of Democrats express an unfavorable opinion of the former president, including 78% who view him very unfavorably.",

        "text": "What you need to know about the child tax credit as both campaigns embrace it\nWhat you need to know about the child tax credit as both campaigns embrace it\n\ntoggle caption Stephen Maturen/Getty Images\n\nThis week tax policy has gotten a star turn on the campaign trail.\n\nRepublican Vice Presidential candidate JD Vance floated the idea of more than doubling the amount of tax credits families can get from the federal government for each child.\n\n\u201cI'd love to see a child tax credit that's $5,000 per child, but you, of course, have to work with Congress to see how possible and viable that is,\" Vance said on CBS \u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has been on the record for a long time supporting a bigger child tax credit, and I think you want it to apply to all American families,\u201d he added, no matter their income.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nVice President Kamala Harris made the child tax credit the center of a campaign speech in Maryland on Thursday.\n\nThe Harris campaign says she would restore the COVID-era policy, and families with newborn babies would get a $6,000 tax credit the first year. And her running mate Gov. Tim Walz signed into law a state-level child tax credit in Minnesota that provides eligible families up to $1,750 per child, in addition to the federal credit.\n\nHere\u2019s a short guide to what the child tax credit is and what changes might be coming in the months ahead.\n\n\n\nA history with a dramatic twist\n\nFor more than a quarter century , American families have gotten money from the federal government for each child in their family.\n\nUnder President Clinton in the late 1990s, the child tax credit gave middle and upper income families $500 per child in the form of a nonrefundable tax credit. The amount and the rules about which families qualify has changed in each presidential administration since then \u2014 currently, eligible families can receive up to $2,000 per child .\n\nThere was one huge, dramatic change that, though it was only in effect briefly, is still making political waves.\n\nAt the height of the pandemic, in 2021, Congress changed the child tax credit in substantial ways as part of the American Rescue Plan Act. \u201cIt made the credit larger, it made the credit available to families with low incomes regardless of their income or tax liability, and it made the credit available to families on a monthly basis,\u201d explains Ashley Burnside , a senior policy analyst with the Center for Law and Social Policy, known as CLASP .\n\nSponsor Message\n\nDuring this period, people could get as much as $3,600 per year per child. Since families didn\u2019t need to earn a certain amount to qualify, 19 million kids in low-income families became eligible for the first time, Burnside says.\n\nFor each child age 5 or younger, for instance, some families got $300 per month deposited directly into their bank account.\n\nThe impact was profound \u2014 the child poverty rate dropped in half . \u201cParents spent their payments towards month-to-month costs \u2014 groceries, rent, bills \u2014 that help families meet their essential needs,\u201d Burnside explains, citing surveys her organization did of low-income families during this time. \u201cWhen families got these monthly payments, the food insecurity rates went down for households with children.\u201d\n\nThen when the expanded credit expired the poverty rate bounced right back up. Researchers found that \u201cfamilies reported having a harder time meeting month-to-month costs like rent and bills and affording nutrient rich foods that are more expensive,\u201d Burnside says.\n\nOf course, there were a lot of other relief programs happening at the same time, notes Anna Aizer , economics professor at Brown University. She and colleagues worked to tease out the effect of that period of a nearly universal, fully refundable child tax credit in a working paper published in June . They concluded that the child tax credit \u201clikely improved child health and well-being in the short and long run, with greater impacts for poor children and modest or nonexistent effects for non-poor children.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally, if we want to reduce child poverty, we know how to do it,\u201d Aizer tells NPR.\n\nBurnside, of CLASP, agrees. \u201cI think a lot of people in America, both lawmakers and voters, have the view that poverty is this thing that we just cannot control \u2014 that just has to happen in our society,\u201d she says. \u201cBut the reality is, we make policy choices as a nation every day that cause poverty to exist and to spiral for more families. And not investing in something like a child tax credit is one choice that we make that allows child poverty to continue to exist.\u201d\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBipartisan support, usually\n\nCongress recently came very close to expanding the child tax credit, but some key Republican Senators opposed the effort and it failed to become law. Vance, a Republican senator from Ohio, was not present for a vote on that bill, saying in the CBS interview that \u201cit was a show vote\u201d and would have failed anyway.\n\nProfessor Mariely L\u00f3pez-Santana of George Mason University says Republicans blocking the most recent effort to expand the bill belies its bipartisan history. \u201cI think it's quite possible that Republicans embrace a child tax credit because it can fit within the platform\u201d and the message that Vance is putting forth that his party supports families, she says.\n\nEven though Republicans generally don\u2019t support as much spending on social programs, \u201cthis is a tax credit, and Republicans, when it comes to supporting different types of social programs, they actually have supported tax expenditure.\u201d L\u00f3pez-Santana thinks political polarization in a presidential election year has slowed what would otherwise be a policy with broad support.\n\nThe attention on this issue and its bipartisan history is encouraging to Burnside from CLASP. \u201cIt gives me hope that both sides of the aisle are talking about this and that \u2014 because of the [2021] expansion \u2014 voters and families see the value in a policy like this,\u201d she says.\n\nThe details of any future expansion matters, notes Aizer, the economist. The key thing about the COVID-era expansion that had such a dramatic impact on child poverty is that it reached the lowest income families, and financial investment in poor children pays lifelong dividends in terms of their health and wellbeing, she says.\n\nVance on CBS said he would favor a credit that would be the same for all families of all income levels. \u201cYou don't want a different policy for higher income families, you just want to have a pro-family Child Tax Credit,\u201d he said.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cI'm not sure we have the evidence that expanding this to the highest income households is going to generate the [same] kinds of benefits,\u201d Aizer says. \u201cBut it'd be really expensive, and if you spend that money on this, there\u2019s something else you're not spending it on.\u201d\n\n",

        "text": "Harris wants to give families a big tax break for a new baby\nHarris wants to give families a big tax break for a new baby\n\ntoggle caption Allison Joyce/AFP\n\nVice President Harris unveiled an economic plan on Friday that focused on the high cost of housing, groceries and raising kids \u2014 top-of-mind expenses for voters pinched by years of rising prices.\n\nThe plan includes a major expansion in the child tax credit. Low- and middle-income families would get up to $6,000 when they have a new baby. And Harris said she wants to restore the pandemic-era program that gave families up to $3,600 per child.\n\nA bigger child tax credit has also been proposed by Republicans. Vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance said on Sunday that he would like to see it expanded to $5,000 per child.\n\nPolls have shown President Biden has struggled to get credit for his efforts to lower prices and many voters say they trust Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump more on the economy \u2014 but polls also show that voters are less critical of Harris on economic issues.\n\n\"Costs are still too high, and on a deeper level, for too many people, no matter how much they work, it feels so hard to just be able to get ahead,\" Harris said on Friday in Raleigh, N.C.\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHarris' plans would cost a lot. Her campaign hasn't said how much\n\nThe child tax credit is both popular with voters and effective at cutting child poverty rates. But, expanding the program also would be expensive.\n\n\"It would be very costly. The current child tax credit costs something like $100 billion a year. This [proposal] would probably double that cost,\" said Kevin Corinth, an economist with the American Enterprise Institute, who worked for the White House Council of Economic Advisers during the Trump era.\n\nThe Harris campaign so far has not put a price tag on its plans.\n\nFelicia Wong, chief executive of Roosevelt Forward, a progressive advocacy group, said Harris' proposals would require new spending. \"The good news is that we certainly have that money in our country,\" Wong said.\n\n\"It is a matter of increasing taxes on the wealthy and corporations and overall changing our tax code, in order to make sure that we can bring in these revenues and then pay for these investments,\" she said.\n\ntoggle caption Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nHarris will focus on housing prices\n\nHarris announced a proposal for tax breaks that her campaign said would lead to 3 million new housing units in four years, going beyond a Biden White House proposal to ease housing shortages with 2 million new and renovated homes.\n\nHarris' plan would give unspecified tax incentives to homebuilders for houses geared to first-time buyers and for affordable rental housing. She proposed a $40 billion fund to help local governments finance developments, up from a $20 billion proposal from the Biden White House. Like all spending, these proposals would depend on Congress being willing to fund them.\n\nHarris said she would ask Congress to give first-time homeowners up to $25,000 toward their down payments \u2014 a plan that her campaign said could help more than 4 million first-time buyers. That is more generous than a plan Biden announced in this year\u2019s State of the Union address that would have given first-time homebuyers a $10,000 tax credit, and help about 400,000 first-generation homebuyers with down-payment assistance.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAnd she said she would back legislation to restrict tax breaks for corporate investors that buy up homes, as well as a bill that would ban rental property owners from buying algorithmic data that helps them hike rent prices.\n\n\n\nHarris would crack down on corporations, her campaign says\n\nHarris and Biden gave campaign-style remarks on Thursday about their efforts to lower prescription drug prices for people on Medicare. Like Biden, Harris is proposing that a $35 cap on the price of insulin be extended for everyone, not just seniors -- as well as a $2,000 cap on out-of-pocket expenses for prescription drugs.\n\nHarris argued that corporations are making too much money from consumers \u2014 a theme she has foreshadowed on the campaign trail, noting her work on price-fixing when she was California's attorney general.\n\n\"A loaf of bread costs 50% more today than it did before the pandemic. Ground beef is up almost 50%. Many of the big food companies are seeing their highest profits in two decades. And while many grocery chains pass along these savings, others still aren't,\" Harris said.\n\nHarris called for a federal ban on price gouging in the food sector, and said her administration would more aggressively investigate and prosecute price-fixing in the meat supply chain.\n\nThis proposal is similar to an approach taken by the Biden administration, which said in Sept. 2021 that it would crack down on price fixing and enforce antitrust laws in the meat sector, as well as provide funding to smaller players to try to boost competition.\n\nHarris\u2019 plan would give the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general the authority to investigate corporations and impose penalties, her campaign said. Many large retailers have kept grocery prices high instead of passing savings along to consumers, Harris said.\n\nKevin Hassett, a top economic adviser in the Trump White House, said that some of Harris' proposals would amount to \"price controls,\" and could lead to shortages of supply. He said Trump's approach of cutting taxes, deregulation, and boosting energy production would do more to address inflation.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"There's not a lot of price gouging going on here with Safeways and Giants and 7-Eleven stores \u2014 they just have very, very, low margins,\" Hassett told reporters on a conference call.\n\nNPR's Alejandra Marquez Janse and Jeongyoon Han contributed to this report.",

The treaty was created when water wasn't as scarce as it is now.\n\nWater from Mexico flows to Texas' half-billion-dollar citrus industry and dozens of cities near the border.

Mexico is some 265 billion gallons of water behind on its deliveries to the United States.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nUnpredictable weather patterns due to climate change, growing populations, aging infrastructure and significant water waste have left both countries strapped for water and have escalated tensions along the border.\n\nMaria-Elena Giner is the U.S. commissioner of the International Boundary and Water Commission, the binational agency that oversees the 1944 water treaty and settles disputes.\n\nMexico is \"at their lowest levels ever\" in the treaty's history, Giner said. The treaty operates in five-year cycles, and the current deadline for deliveries isn't until October 2025.\n\nBut \"the question is that they're so far behind, it will be very difficult, if not statistically impossible, for them to make up that difference,\" Giner said.\n\nVictor Maga\u00f1a Rueda, an environmental scientist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, said neither country can survive without the other's water. He called the 1944 treaty a first step.\n\n\"Now we have to probably think of how we manage water and each side to adapt to those changes that we are experiencing in terms of climate,\" Rueda said.\n\ntoggle caption Andy Jacobsohn/AFP via Getty Images\n\nTensions rise in the U.S.\n\nAlready, Texas' last sugar mill shut down this year due to lack of water, lawmakers from the state have said. Now, officials don't want the same thing to happen to the state's citrus industry, concentrated in the Lower Rio Grande Valley, and to other agricultural activities dependent on Mexican water.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nTen lawmakers from a bipartisan congressional delegation urged the U.S. Congress to withhold appropriations of money and assistance to Mexico \u2014 outside of funds for border control \u2014 until it delivers the needed water.\n\n\"Farmers and ranchers across South Texas remain under continued financial strain and could suffer a similar fate as the sugar industry, should Mexico continue withholding water,\" the lawmakers wrote in May. \"Additionally, the lack of reliable water delivery affects municipalities and threatens the quality of life for many American citizens living along our border.\"\n\nRep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat, signed the letter. He said this isn't the first time he has witnessed Mexico falling behind on water deliveries.\n\nBut the unpredictability of this cycle has created significant hardship for members of his congressional district in the southwest tip of Texas along the Rio Grande.\n\n\"Mexico has not even responded to this, which means one thing to me,\" Cuellar said last month about the letter. \"That means that the possible loss of money is probably less important than the water right now for their communities. Their silence tells you that they're more interested in water than money right now.\"\n\nRep. Monica de la Cruz, a Texas Republican and another Texas representative who signed the letter, spoke before Congress in May to emphasize the loss of agriculture and industry in South Texas.\n\n\"If we cannot save our farmers, then Mexico does not deserve to have any money appropriated to them,\" the Republican said. \"We want our water \u2014 we demand our water.\"\n\ntoggle caption Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n\nTo be sure, Congress hasn't yet funded the government for the next fiscal year, which begins in October, and could take up a temporary stopgap bill to avert a shutdown. So the threat of financial loss to Mexico remains more theoretical at this point.\n\nAs urgent as receiving water from Mexico may seem, it isn't the only water problem for Texas. In Texas and several other states across the U.S., a significant amount of water is wasted from infrastructure breaks and leaks.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe state lost an estimated 129 billion gallons of water in 2022 \u2014 the latest figures available from water-loss audit data submitted by public water suppliers to the Texas Water Development Board.\n\n\n\nWater politics in Mexico\n\nTo address the water scarcity in Texas, officials last year proposed a solution: a treaty \"minute,\" or amendment, that would allow Mexico to pay water directly to South Texas instead of giving two-thirds to the Mexican state of Tamaulipas first, as currently specified in the treaty.\n\nBut quenching the thirst in South Texas ahead of its own citizens was likely a nonstarter ahead of Mexico's presidential election this year.\n\nNegotiations on the treaty changes were completed and both countries were set to sign last December, but Mexico has yet to receive official authorization to do so, said Giner, of the International Boundary and Water Commission.\n\nSeveral Mexican officials contacted for this story declined to comment on the record about Mexico's water deliveries to Texas and future treaty negotiations.\n\nBut on Mexico's side of the border, the country is facing its own water issues, beyond water battles with the United States. A crisis in Mexico City this year left many of its 22 million residents without clean water as the city prepared for the possibility of running out.\n\nThese strains, along with rapidly growing populations, have put the country severely behind on its water deliveries to the United States.\n\nIn April, Mexico's current president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, said that the country will focus on guaranteeing water for its residents.\n\n\"Priority must be given to domestic water, which is consumed by people rather than by companies,\" he said. \"We are looking for a way to address the problem of drought, of water shortages \u2014 work is being done.\"\n\nThe new president-elect, Claudia Sheinbaum, is expected to take a similar approach when she takes office in October, Rueda, the environmental scientist, said.\n\ntoggle caption Rodrigo Oropeza/AFP via Getty Images\n\nTroubles ahead of last election\n\nThis five-year cycle isn't the first time Mexico has fallen behind on providing water to the United States.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nToward the end of the last cycle, which concluded just days before the 2020 U.S. presidential election, Mexico had delivered most but not all of its water to the United States.\n\nMexico tried to pull water from a dam in Chihuahua state but was unsuccessful. Three days before the official deadline, Mexico and the U.S. agreed to a minute that permitted Mexico to transfer to the U.S. the water in the Amistad and Falcon reservoirs along the border to avoid a shortfall.\n\nBut that transfer of reservoir water nearly depleted all of northern Mexico's stored water resources, making the country even more vulnerable to future disruptions.\n\nFor this current cycle, if Mexico is unable to deliver all its water, the treaty allows for a water debt to be carried over for one cycle.\n\nSo if Mexico doesn't catch up by the end of this cycle, it can repay its debt by the end of the following one. Minute 234 stipulates that neither country may accrue a shortfall for two consecutive five-year cycles.\n\nRueda, the environmental scientist in Mexico, said some farmers in Mexico want the treaty with the U.S. to be dissolved because they need the water for their crops.\n\nBut doing so would be disastrous for residents of both countries as a whole.\n\n\"If we stop the treaty, then it will mean a real disaster for that region, just because of the selfishness of a few,\" he said.",

She can\u2019t afford to lose votes\n\nPosted on: 16 August 2024\n\nDaniel Geary, School of Histories and Humanities, writes in the Irish Times about how what happens at next week\u2019s Democratic convention in Chicago may determine whether or not Harris wins the US presidential election in November.\n\n\u201cThe whole world is watching.\u201d So chanted anti-war demonstrators in the summer of 1968 as they were brutalised by Chicago police outside the Democratic convention. The party was torn apart and lost the presidency. You\u2019d think Democrats would never want to hold their convention in Chicago again. But next week they are. The whole world will again be watching, this time to see if Kamala Harris can maintain the momentum and party unity she\u2019ll need to defeat Donald Trumpthis November.\n\n1968 is the only time when a president decided not to seek re-election after his party\u2019s primaries had already begun. Then, it was Lyndon Johnson; today, it\u2019s Joe Biden. Then, vice-president Humphrey ran instead; today, it\u2019s vice-president Harris. The main issue in 1968 was the Vietnam War. Anti-war candidate Eugene McCarthy\u2019s surprising strong performance in the New Hampshire primary precipitated Johnson\u2019s decision to withdraw. Then, Robert Kennedy entered the race, pledging to de-escalate the war in Vietnam and to do more to address poverty and racial injustice.\n\nRichard Daley, the Irish-American mayor of Chicago, had promised anti-war protesters a hostile response. And he delivered. It was, as a later investigation called it, a \u201cpolice riot\u201d. Police viciously beat anti-war protesters, most of whom were nonviolent. They even attacked bystanders and journalists. The normally mild-mannered senator George McGovern, who was running in place of the recently assassinated Kennedy, shouted obscenities at the police from the window of his hotel room. The violence on the streets of the Chicago brought the conflict within the convention hall into the open. Jewish senator Abraham Ribicoff accused Daley of \u201cGestapo tactics\u201d. Daley replied with a string of anti-Semitic expletives.\n\nViolence and division at this year\u2019s Democratic convention are unlikely to reach 1968 levels. Chicago mayor Brandon Johnson is no Richard Daley. He promises to protect protesters, not attack them. And Gaza is not Vietnam. This is a war being fought by a foreign ally of the US, not by American troops. Yet many coming to Chicago care deeply about the war in Gaza. Pro-Palestinian activists plan large demonstrations outside the convention. They will protest the Biden administration\u2019s continued backing of Israeli ethnic cleansing and war crimes. They will be joined by some within the convention hall. Some delegates were elected on \u201cuncommitted\u201d ballots (ie, not pledge to any candidate) specifically to protest Biden\u2019s policies on the war. Also, a growing number of Democratic politicians have also become vocal critics of Biden. Expect contentious debate within the party that would be exacerbated by any violence in the streets.\n\nThe convention is the next big test for Harris. Her campaign could hardly have gone better since she took over from Biden a few weeks ago. She has brought tremendous energy to the race. She is now leading polls against Trump in key battleground states. Her savvy choice of Tim Walz as her vice-presidential candidate showed that she understands the need to rally the party behind her. Her other options would have alienated the party\u2019s progressive wing.\n\nBut Harris is walking a tightrope when it comes to the ongoing horrific Israeli war on Gaza. Harris signalled that she has a different attitude toward it than Biden. After meeting with Binyamin Netanyahu last month, she said she \u201cwill not be silent\u201d about Palestinian suffering. But such sentiments are unlikely to satisfy pro-Palestinian protesters. And nor should they. The US is providing Israel with the weapons it is using to fight this war. When you are providing the instruments of suffering, saying you won\u2019t be silent doesn\u2019t suffice.\n\nHarris can meet the concerns of pro-Palestinian critics by doing three things. First, she can reiterate the need for an immediate ceasefire. The Biden administration has in fact shifted on this issue; its initial enthusiasm for the war has dampened. Second, Harris can acknowledge that pro-Palestinian activists have a right to protest. Finally, she can signal a future willingness to change American policy of unqualified military support for Israel.\n\nHarris\u2019s best argument is this: the alternative to her is Trump, who would be worse on this issue as on so many others. But to prevail against Trump, Harris needs her party united behind her. She cannot afford to lose any votes over Gaza in an election that stands on the razor\u2019s edge. What happens next week in Chicago may determine whether or not Harris wins in November. In 1968, Humphrey lost a close election to Nixon at least partly because anti-war voters abstained. Let us hope history does not repeat itself.\n\nThis article was first published in The Irish Times. Read the original article on the Irish Times website.",

The content did not get much reach \u2014 but focused on a number of divisive issues including the U.S. presidential election, Israel's war in Gaza, and Israel's presence at the Olympic Games. The AI-generated materials catered to both progressive and conservative audiences.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"This operation does not appear to have achieved meaningful audience engagement. The majority of social media posts that we identified received few or no likes, shares, or comments,\" OpenAI said.\n\nThe investigation found AI-generated long-form articles were published on websites posing to be news outlets. Meanwhile, OpenAI said the now-banned accounts composed social media comments \u2014 both in English and Spanish \u2014 by asking ChatGPT to rewrite comments already posted by other social media users.\n\n\"They interspersed their political content with comments about fashion and beauty, possibly to appear more authentic or in an attempt to build a following,\" the company said.\n\nOpenAI's internal investigation comes a week after Microsoft's Threat Analysis Center report, which showed how groups connected to the Iranian government were using a spectrum of online tactics in an attempt to meddle in the U.S. presidential election.\n\nA day after Microsoft issued the report, Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign said it was hacked and accused Iranian actors of stealing sensitive internal documents. The campaign did not provide specific evidence. On Wednesday, the Google Threat Analysis Group said it detected and disrupted a phishing operation by Iranian hackers to target both the Trump and Biden-Harris campaigns.\n\n\n\nWhat's the motive behind the Iranian-linked operation?\n\nOpenAI said the accounts were linked to a covert operation known as Storm-2035. Last week, Microsoft researchers found that the same group was behind four websites pretending to be American news outlets.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe fake sites amplified polarizing messaging on hot-button issues related to LGBTQ rights and the Israel-Hamas conflict. The goal is to incite chaos and stir polarization among American voters ahead of Election Day, according to Clint Watts, the general manager at Microsoft's Threat Analysis Center.\n\n\"Iran is focused as much on just breaking the ability of an election to occur,\" Watts told NPR last week.\n\nBoth Microsoft and OpenAI reported that the websites and the AI-generated content did not garner many page views or much online engagement.",

        "text": "What to know about US election hacking, Iran and other countries\nWhat to know about US election hacking, Iran and other countries\n\nReuters The Trump campaign recently said it had been hacked by Iran\n\nThe recent claim by Donald Trump's campaign that they were hacked by Iran is one sign that foreign interference may become a prominent issue in this year's US election. The election result will have major implications around the world, meaning many countries have an incentive to try and interfere to either support a particular candidate or just to destabilise America. And the nature of America\u2019s open democracy and media, coupled with new forms of technology, provides many potential avenues to try and shape the eventual outcome. \u201cOur adversaries do look at American elections as points to try to influence, to try to undermine confidence in our democracy, to try to put their thumb on the scale,\u201d National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said last month. \u201cWe are clear eyed about that. And we are doing a lot to push back against it\". So who might be trying to interfere? Three countries are most widely cited: Iran, Russia and China.\n\nIran\n\n\u201cIran is becoming increasingly aggressive in their foreign influence efforts, seeking to stoke discord and undermine confidence in our democratic institutions,\u201d US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said in July. The Trump campaign says it was hacked by Iran, although it has not been confirmed that an offer of stolen campaign documents to news outlets was definitely linked to this. Microsoft recently said it had seen \"the emergence of significant influence activity\" by groups linked to Iran, and Google has said Iranian hackers targeted the Biden campaign (before he dropped out of the race) as well as that of Donald Trump. The assessment is that the Iranians are more likely to be opposed to a return of Trump to the White House. He and his advisers are seen as more hawkish in their rhetoric as well as in their past actions, which include pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal and killing top Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in January 2020. On social media, Iran has also been accused of stoking tensions over Gaza.\n\nRussia\n\n\u201cRussia remains the predominant threat to US elections,\u201d according to the most recent assessment by US intelligence. But so far it has been less visible than Iran. Russia has a long track record of using what it calls \"active measures\" to influence public opinion back through the Cold War. And in 2016, the US was caught largely unaware by a Russian operation which saw the Democratic Party as well as Hillary Clinton's campaign operatives have their emails hacked and then leaked.\n\nMore on the US election\n\nRussian hackers \u2013 likely from both the foreign intelligence agency the SVR and the military intelligence agency the GRU \u2013 are among the most skilled and may try to compromise accounts. Russian social media campaigns have also moved on from 2016 when fake profiles were used to organise real-world demonstrations against Hillary Clinton during the campaign. Moscow is thought to be outsourcing some efforts to commercial firms in order to distance itself and look for more effective ways of reaching audiences. If Moscow does get involved, security analysts believe it it would most likely be to favour Trump. The former president has been more friendly to Moscow and more critical of the NATO defence alliance. Russia's Vladimir Putin recently denied he was backing Trump, but even that was seen as a diversionary tactic.\n\nChina\n\nChina is the wildcard in terms of interference. It has hacked US campaigns to gather intelligence all the way back to 2008. But it tends to be less active than the other two in trying to influence a particular result. US intelligence currently believe it \"probably does not plan to influence the outcome\" of the election. There is also less confidence as to who China\u2019s preferred candidate might be should it decide to do anything. Donald Trump can be unpredictable and confrontational with Beijing but is less likely to continue the Biden administration\u2019s policy of building a web of alliances, which has worried Beijing.\n\nTrump or Biden: Will China\u2019s Communist Party elite reveal who they back?\n\nBeijing may also be wary of antagonising the US at this point by being seen to interfere, something neither Iran nor Russia worry so much about. But China is accused of trying to target candidates at a local or congressional level because of their backgrounds or positions on issues of concern to China. In the 2022 mid-terms it was assessed of doing so in a handful of races involving both Democrats and Republicans. All three countries have consistently denied carrying out election interference operations.\n\nThe challenges for the US\n\nBack in 2016, material hacked by Russia received extensive media coverage. But that seems to have changed now with media outlets more cautious about giving prominence to stolen data. And there there are more people now looking for influence operations as well as improved cybersecurity defences around campaigns. But despite this, the challenge has evolved. One complexity is that it can be harder to disentangle foreign interference from domestic free speech. Some countries may use Americans to seed or spread their messages. Sometimes those Americans will be willing collaborators, but sometimes they will be unwitting, perhaps even engaged to write for websites which they do not know work for Moscow or someone else. And there are new worries because there has been a step change in the technology on offer to those seeking to interfere thanks to artificial intelligence and deepfakes. These potentially allow more tailored approaches to individuals over social media, and the creation of more convincing faked content. This could lead people to doubt what is real and what is not. However, in other elections around the world this year, the general consensus is that these techniques have not been deployed as much as some feared. But America\u2019s election is by far the most consequential globally (and also likely a tight race) meaning new techniques might be deployed for the first time. And given the political atmosphere this time is more combustible and polarised than in the past. A further risk, too, is that even the claim that there has been foreign interference can be politicised and used to cast doubt on an election result.",

        "text": "August 17, 2024, presidential campaign news\nDonald Trump takes the stage during a campaign rally in Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania. Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images\n\nFormer President Donald Trump on Saturday criticized Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 newly unveiled economic agenda and questioned why she hadn\u2019t implemented her proposals while she was already in office.\n\n\u201cYesterday, Kamala laid out her so-called economic plan. She says she\u2019s going to lower the cost of food and housing starting on day one, but day one for Kamala was three and a half years ago, so why didn\u2019t she do it then?\u201d Trump said at a rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.\n\nTrump said, \u201cSo this is Day 1305, we\u2019re at thirteen hundred and give, so why isn\u2019t she doing it now? Why doesn\u2019t she get away from her nice little place with her wonderful husband, go to Washington and do it now? You could do it right now.\u201d\n\nTrump said Harris\u2019 plan is \u201cvery dangerous because it may sound good politically, and that\u2019s the problem, and we have to be very careful because when somebody gets up and says, \u2018We\u2019re going to give you everything, $25,000 for a house, we\u2019re going to give you all sorts of little goodies, free health care, we\u2019re going to give you everything, universal health care,\u2019 it sounds so beautiful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI told my people, you gotta be very careful. \u2026 It\u2019s dangerous, because she\u2019s saying that she\u2019s going to give away things that she\u2019ll never be able to get approved,\u201d Trump said.\n\nHarris on Friday proposed a new plan to provide tax relief for more than 100 million middle-class and lower-income Americans, and her new economic agenda includes measures aimed at making housing, groceries, health care and child rearing more affordable.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s promising to hand out things she can\u2019t deliver. She can never deliver them; she will never get them approved,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cThe things that she said yesterday don\u2019t work. They have never worked,\u201d he added.\n\nTrump again falsely claimed that implementing a tariff \u201cdoesn\u2019t affect our country.\u201d\n\nCNN has previously fact checked that study after study including one from the federal government\u2019s bipartisan US International Trade Commission, have shown that American consumers and industries bear almost the entire cost of US tariffs, including those duties previously imposed by Trump. When the US puts a tariff on an imported good, the cost of the tariff comes directly out of the bank account of an American importer when the foreign-made product arrives at a US port. It\u2019s possible that some foreign manufacturers lowered their prices to stay competitive in the US market after Trump raised tariffs \u2013 but not enough to keep the cost paid by American importers the same as before.",

        "text": "2024 US presidential election: Hope has changed sides\nThe conventions held by the two main American parties every four years, prior to each presidential election, are a great tradition of political life on the other side of the Atlantic, a kind of oratorical rodeo, a mixture of tradition, emotion and, in good years, revelations. The Democratic National Convention that opens in Chicago on Monday, August 19, promises to be like no other: It will be the scene of the coronation of an unexpected candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris, who, in the space of three weeks, has electrified the campaign, pushed Donald Trump up against his tired boxer's ropes and given the Democrats back their taste for victory.\n\nSince July 21 hope has in fact changed sides. The decision by 81-year-old President Joe Biden to withdraw from the race in favor of Harris, bowing to pressure from Democratic leaders worried about the impact of his age, has completely reversed the dynamic. The timing of the announcement sharply cut the dramatization around the attack on Republican candidate Trump, who had been shot in the ear a week earlier during an election rally. It also obliterated the media boost of his party's convention, held over the following days in Milwaukee.\n\nCalifornia ex-prosecutor Kamala Harris, 59, has transformed herself from a lackluster vice president, keeping her place in the president's shadow, into an energetic candidate with infectious enthusiasm. Going on the offensive, she has so far made a clean sweep, confirmed by a rapid rise in the polls, particularly among Black and Hispanic voters who were moving away from Biden.\n\nRead Part 1 Subscribers only Kamala Harris, a Californian conquering the East\n\nAn optimistic and confident ticket\n\nThe size of the crowds she draws to her rallies has unsettled Trump, who is so sure of his singular appeal that he has accused her, against all evidence, of using artificial intelligence to inflate images of packed stands. The choice of a Midwesterner as a teammate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, was very well received by supporters. The image of an optimistic, confident ticket contrasts with the tougher, more vindictive duo of Trump and JD Vance, the young Republican senator from Ohio. Finally, Harris began to set out her vision for the presidential term she is seeking by revealing, on August 16, the broad outlines of an economic policy focused on improving the purchasing power of the middle class and the role of the federal state in this effort.\n\nAs spectacular as this new Democratic turnaround is, Harris still has to accomplish what's most crucial. The polls give the Harris-Walz ticket hope of ousting the Trump-Vance duo in the key states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and even making headway in Georgia and Arizona. But the Republican Party, which retains the advantage in the Electoral College system, is far from defeated. Trump has plenty of opportunities to bounce back between now and November 5, including in the televised debate with the Democratic nominee on September 10.\n\nIn the meantime, Harris and her party already have one success to their credit, which the convention will have to confirm: that of having put hope, dynamism and rationality back at the center of the democratic game in the United States and offered in record time a solid alternative to the disastrous prospect of a second Trump term.",

        "text": "County in US state of Pennsylvania boasts uncanny ability to choose presidents\nThe voters of Northampton County, in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania, have chosen the victor of all but three U.S. presidential elections since 1920.\n\nThe only misses: picking Democrat Hubert Humphrey over Republican Richard Nixon in 1968; preferring Democrat Al Gore, who won the popular vote nationwide in 2000 but narrowly lost the electoral vote \u2014 which determines the winner \u2014 to Republican George W. Bush; and four years later, selecting Democrat John Kerry over incumbent Bush.\n\nThat is one of the reasons that the county is a focus of this year\u2019s presidential campaigns by Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party\u2019s nominee, and former President Donald Trump, the Republican vying to become only the second candidate to successfully return to the presidency for a nonconsecutive second term.\n\nNorthampton County has seen it all, predating the American Revolution. It was established in 1752 when Pennsylvania was a colonial-era province.\n\nThe county seat of Easton was one of the three places where the Declaration of Independence was first read to the public. The city was a major commercial and transportation hub in the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nSteel legacy\n\nSixteen kilometers (10 miles) to the southwest, Bethlehem was synonymous with industrial might from the days of the blacksmith to the era of mass production, which ended here when Bethlehem Steel went bankrupt, the company dissolved, and its assets were sold in the early 21st century.\n\nThat legacy remains fresh and bitter for tens of thousands of voters in the Lehigh Valley with direct links to Bethlehem Steel.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s in the steel business now, and they want to know: What are these candidates going to do to bring those jobs back or to rebuild America?\u201d said Samuel Chen, a Republican strategist with the Liddell Group.\n\nWhat is on the minds of the county\u2019s voters has ramifications beyond the Lehigh Valley.\n\nNorthampton County \u201chas incredible predictive power,\u201d according to Christopher Borick, a political science professor at Muhlenberg College in Allentown. \u201cWhat really makes it magical in its ability to predict what happens in the state and nationally is its mix.\u201d\n\nThat mix includes farmers fretting about agricultural policies and suburbanites focused on social issues, education and taxes. And the demographics of the county are in flux \u2014 with additional new residents from New York and Philadelphia seeking more-affordable housing and better neighborhoods. There is also a growing Hispanic population in Bethlehem and neighboring Allentown.\n\n\u201cWe also have large groups of white working-class individuals that have been pivotal in politics during the ascension of Trump\u2019s populism,\u201d Borick told VOA. \u201cThat mix has made it particularly competitive, and one of the reasons why it\u2019s one of the few counties in Pennsylvania that went from Barack Obama to Donald Trump to Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nMore tolerance\n\nThe county\u2019s diversity is one of its strengths and a reason there is more tolerance and moderation here than other places in a nation now deeply divided politically, according to Chen, who is also an assistant professor of political science at Northampton Community College.\n\n\u201cIn Northampton County, it is very difficult to travel this county, live in this county, and not meet people that are different than you \u2014 the way you look, the way you think, the way you believe. I think that softens them to some of that more hard-core \u2018us versus them\u2019 rhetoric that we see in today\u2019s politics,\u201d Chen explained in a VOA interview at the WBPH-TV studio, where he hosts a weekly public affairs talk show.\n\nWhile Democrats have a slight edge among registered voters in the county, the numbers are practically even between what Chen described as hard-core Republicans and hard-core Democrats.\n\n\u201cThat small percentage of people who are willing to swing are going to decide that election time and time and time again,\u201d said Chen.\n\nAnd that is why Northampton County is known as Swing County USA, where there is still a significant percentage of voters who split their ballots between parties and prioritize issues over personalities.\n\n\u201cBeing the president is a job. And so, we care more about, \u2018Is the job going to get done?\u2019 \u201d said Rachel Lowell, a new mother concerned about women\u2019s rights and environmental policies, who spoke to VOA on Bethlehem\u2019s Main Street.\n\nAnother passerby on Main Street predicted the majority of his fellow county voters would support the Democrats for a second consecutive presidential election, as they are increasingly turned off by what they regard as Trump\u2019s bombast and antics.\n\n\u201cFrom talking to people who I know voted for Trump in the last election, they\u2019re not going to vote for him this time around because they\u2019re saying that they\u2019re kind of tired of it,\u201d said Mick O\u2019Hearn.\n\nIn Easton, Harris is not going to get Wayne Jones\u2019 vote because, he said, Trump is tougher on stopping illegal immigration.\n\n\u201cIf I had to choose right now \u2014 Trump, hands down. I mean, [the Democrats] letting all these people cross the border?\u201d said an exasperated Jones, a house painter, as he stood on the spot where the Declaration of Independence was read aloud on July 8, 1776.\n\n'Overwhelming' attention\n\nThe county\u2019s voters take seriously their pivotal role in picking presidents, but that blessing can be a curse, according to Borick, who is also director of the Institute of Public Opinion at Muhlenberg College.\n\n\u201cI live in Northampton County. The mailings I get, or when I turn on the TV, the amount of ads is omnipresent. It\u2019s beautiful to be wanted, but sometimes the attention can be overwhelming,\u201d he said.\n\nPennsylvania is worth 19 electoral votes out of the 270 needed to capture the presidency, making it practically a must-win state for both campaigns.\n\nTwo polls released Thursday showed Harris now leading Trump in the state, erasing Biden\u2019s deficit in surveys there before he was pressured out of the race by leading Democrats.\n\nRendy Wicaksana of VOA\u2019s Indonesian Service contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Both presidential campaigns descend on critical swing state of Pennsylvania\nThe US presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris will hold dueling campaign events this weekend in the critical political battleground state of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe former president was due to hold a Saturday rally in Wilkes-Barre in the north-east of the state, while the vice-president is on a bus tour of western Pennsylvania starting in Pittsburgh on Sunday, before the Democratic national convention kicks off on Monday in Chicago.\n\nSeparately, Tim Walz, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate and Minnesota governor, was scheduled to hold a rally in La Vista, Nebraska, on Saturday.\n\nAccording to an NYT/Siena College poll published on Saturday, Harris is now leading Trump among probable voters in Arizona by 50% to 45%, and North Carolina, 49% to 47%, while trailing narrowly in Nevada and in Georgia by a four-point margin.\n\nBut the three critical so-called Rust belt states, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, continue to preoccupy the rival campaigns, with Pennsylvania and its 19 electoral college votes considered key to both candidates\u2019 chances of victory in November.\n\n1:58 Tim Walz talks about Nebraska roots at Omaha rally and pushes back against Trump AI claim - video\n\nSince 2008, the trio have been reliable bellwethers of the outcomes of national elections. Pennsylvania\u2019s electoral college votes, plus Michigan\u2019s 15 and Wisconsin\u2019s 10, are typically enough to put a candidate over the top in the race to secure the 270 total needed to win the White House.\n\nThe election forecaster Nate Silver calculates that Pennsylvania is more than twice as likely as any other to be the \u201ctipping point\u201d state for presidential victory this fall.\n\nBoth campaigns are on the hunt for support among white, non-college-educated voters, with the Harris-Walz ticket looking to shore up support among suburban voters and to drive up voter turnout in urban areas with large Black populations that Trump and his running mate, the Ohio senator JD Vance, are hoping to peel off.\n\nBoth campaign strategies are considered \u201cwin big, lose small\u201d but with different focuses: for Democrats in Pennsylvania, that means looking for big margins in the cities and suburbs of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, while limiting losses in rural parts of the state such as Beaver county, close to Butler, where Trump was shot by a would-be assassin last month.\n\nTrump won Pennsylvania in 2016 by around 44,000 votes, a margin of less than one percentage point, while Biden prevailed by just more than 80,000 votes in 2020, a 1.2% margin.\n\nHarris is leading Trump by more than 2% in the state, according to the forecaster FiveThirtyEight. Recent polls \u2013 by Quinnipiac and by the New York Times and Siena College \u2013 placed Harris three and four percentage points ahead, respectively, among probable voters in the state.\n\n\u201cThe Trump campaign believes there\u2019s still some juice left in that orange for them in the heart of north-east Pennsylvania,\u201d Chris Nicholas, the Pennsylvania Republican consultant, told the Philadelphia Inquirer last week.\n\nSaturday\u2019s Trump rally will be in the indoor Mohegan Sun Arena with a capacity of around 8,000 people. The Trump campaign has said the candidate would return to Butler in October but a date has not been announced.\n\nPennsylvania is also the recipient of more campaign spending than any other battleground. The Wall Street Journal calculated that of more than $110m spent across seven swing states since 22 July, when Joe Biden dropped out of his re-election race, $42m has been funneled into the state.\n\nDemocratic and Republican political groups have also reserved $114m in ad time in Pennsylvania from late August to November \u2013 more than twice than planned for Arizona, the next highest, at $55m.\n\nThe Pennsylvania push is set only to intensify. Harris and Walz and their spouses will making stops across Allegheny and Beaver counties on Sunday, while Trump will respond to Harris\u2019s recent economic policy proposals at an event in York, Pennsylvania, on Monday and Vance will be in Philadelphia.\n\nAnd Pennsylvania will again be in focus when ABC hosts the first Harris-Trump debate in Philadelphia on 10 September.\n\nReuters contributed reporting",

        "text": "2024 US Presidential elections: Kamala Harris proposes ban on \u2018price gouging\u2019 - here\u2019s why\nWith inflation and high grocery prices still frustrating many voters, Vice President Kamala Harris on Friday proposed a ban on \u201cprice gouging\u201d by food suppliers and grocery stores, as part of a broader agenda aimed at lowering the cost of housing, medicine, and food.\n\nIt's an attempt to tackle a clear vulnerability of Harris' head-on: Under the Biden-Harris administration, grocery prices have shot up 21%, part of an inflation surge that has raised overall costs by about 19% and soured many Americans on the economy, even as unemployment fell to historic lows.\n\nWages have also risen sharply since the pandemic, and have outpaced prices for more than a year. Still, surveys find Americans continue to struggle with higher costs.\n\n\u201cWe all know that prices went up during the pandemic when the supply chains shut down and failed,\u201d Harris said Friday in Raleigh, North Carolina. \u201cBut our supply chains have now improved and prices are still too high.\u201d\n\nWill her proposals do much to lower prices? And what even is \u201cprice gouging\u201d?\n\nAlso Read | Kamala Harris\u2019s economic team and agenda start to take shape\n\nWhat is price gouging? There is no strict definition that economists would agree on, but it generally refers to spikes in prices that typically follow a disruption in supply, such as after a hurricane or other natural disaster. Consumer advocates charge that gouging occurs when retailers sharply increase prices, particularly for necessities, under such circumstances.\n\nIs it already illegal? Several states already restrict price gouging, but there is no federal-level ban.\n\nThere are federal restrictions on related but different practices, such as price-fixing laws that bar companies from agreeing to not compete against each other and set higher prices.\n\nWill Harris' proposal lower grocery prices? Most economists would say no, though her plan could have an impact on future crises. For one thing, it's unclear how much price gouging is going on right now.\n\nGrocery prices are still painfully high compared to four years ago, but they increased just 1.1% in July compared with a year earlier, according to the most recent inflation report. That is in line with pre-pandemic increases.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Wednesday that inflation has been defeated after Wednesday's inflation report showed that it fell to 2.9% in July, the smallest increase in three years.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some dissonance between claiming victory on the inflation front in one breath and then arguing that there\u2019s all this price gouging happening that is leading consumers to face really high prices in another breath,\u201d said Michael Strain, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute.\n\nIn general, after an inflationary spike, it's very hard to return prices to where they were. Sustained price declines typically only happen in steep, protracted recessions. Instead, economists generally argue that the better approach is for wages to keep rising enough so that Americans can handle the higher costs.\n\nSo why is Harris talking about this now? Probably because inflation remains a highly salient issue politically. And plenty of voters do blame grocery stores, fast food chains, and food and packaged goods makers for the surge of inflation in the past three years. Corporate profits soared in 2021 and 2022.\n\n\u201cIt could be that they\u2019re looking at opinion polls that show that the number one concern facing voters is inflation and that a large number of voters blame corporations for inflation,\u201d Strain said.\n\nAt the same time, even if prices aren't going up as much, as Harris noted, they remain high, even as supply chain kinks have been resolved.\n\nElizabeth Pancotti, a policy analyst at Roosevelt Forward, a progressive advocacy group, points to the wood pulp used in diapers. The price of wood pulp has fallen by half from its post-pandemic peak, yet diaper prices haven't.\n\n\u201cSo that just increases the (profit) margins for both the manufacturers and the retailers,\u201d she said.\n\nDid price gouging cause inflation? Most economists would say no, that it was a more straightforward case of supply and demand. When the pandemic hit, meat processing plants were occasionally closed after COVID-19 outbreaks, among other disruptions to supply. Russia's invasion of Ukraine lifted the cost of wheat and other grains on global markets. Auto prices rose as carmakers were unable to get all the semiconductors they needed from Taiwan to manufacture cars, and many car plants shut down temporarily.\n\nAt the same time, several rounds of stimulus checks fattened Americans' bank accounts, and after hunkering down during the early phase of the pandemic, so-called \u201crevenge spending\u201d took over. The combination of stronger demand and reduced supply was a recipe for rising prices.\n\nStill, some economists have argued that large food and consumer goods companies took advantage of pandemic-era disruptions. Consumers saw empty store shelves and heard numerous stories about disrupted supply chains, and at least temporarily felt they had little choice but to accept the higher prices.\n\nEconomist Isabella Weber at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, called it \u201cseller\u2019s inflation.\u201d Others referred to it as \u201cgreedflation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat a lot of corporations did was exploit consumers' willingness\u201d to accept the disruptions from the pandemic, Pancotti said.\n\nAlso Read | Oil executives reject price-gouging accusations\n\nIs banning price gouging like instituting price controls? During the last spike of inflation in the 1970s, both Democratic and Republican presidential administrations at times imposed price controls, which specifically limited what companies could charge for goods and services. They were widely blamed for creating shortages and long lines for gas.\n\nSome economists say Harris' proposal would have a similar impact.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a heavy-handed socialist policy that I don\u2019t think any economist would support,\" said Kevin Hassett, a former top economic adviser in the Trump White House.\n\nBut Pancotti disagreed. She argued that it was closer to a consumer protection measure. Under Harris' proposal, the government wouldn't specify prices, but the Federal Trade Commission could investigate price spikes.",

        "text": "OpenAI Blocks Iranian Influence Operation Using ChatGPT for U.S. Election Propaganda\nOpenAI on Friday said it banned a set of accounts linked to what it said was an Iranian covert influence operation that leveraged ChatGPT to generate content that, among other things, focused on the upcoming U.S. presidential election.\n\n\"This week we identified and took down a cluster of ChatGPT accounts that were generating content for a covert Iranian influence operation identified as Storm-2035,\" OpenAI said.\n\n\"The operation used ChatGPT to generate content focused on a number of topics \u2014 including commentary on candidates on both sides in the U.S. presidential election \u2013 which it then shared via social media accounts and websites.\"\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) company said the content did not achieve any meaningful engagement, with a majority of the social media posts receiving negligible to no likes, shares, and comments. It further noted it had found little evidence that the long-form articles created using ChatGPT were shared on social media platforms.\n\nThe articles catered to U.S. politics and global events, and were published on five different websites that posed as progressive and conservative news outlets, indicating an attempt to target people on opposite sides of the political spectrum.\n\nOpenAI said its ChatGPT tool was used to create comments in English and Spanish, which were then posted on a dozen accounts on X and one on Instagram. Some of these comments were generated by asking its AI models to rewrite comments posted by other social media users.\n\n\"The operation generated content about several topics: mainly, the conflict in Gaza, Israel's presence at the Olympic Games, and the U.S. presidential election\u2014and to a lesser extent politics in Venezuela, the rights of Latinx communities in the U.S. (both in Spanish and English), and Scottish independence,\" OpenAI said.\n\n\"They interspersed their political content with comments about fashion and beauty, possibly to appear more authentic or in an attempt to build a following.\"\n\nStorm-2035 was also one of the threat activity clusters highlighted last week by Microsoft, which described it as an Iranian network \"actively engaging U.S. voter groups on opposing ends of the political spectrum with polarizing messaging on issues such as the U.S. presidential candidates, LGBTQ rights, and the Israel-Hamas conflict.\"\n\nSome of the phony news and commentary sites set up by the group include EvenPolitics, Nio Thinker, Savannah Time, Teorator, and Westland Sun. These sites have also been observed utilizing AI-enabled services to plagiarize a fraction of their content from U.S. publications. The group is said to be operational from 2020.\n\nMicrosoft has further warned of an uptick in foreign malign influence activity targeting the U.S. election over the past six months from both Iranian and Russian networks, the latter of which have been traced back to clusters tracked as Ruza Flood (aka Doppelganger), Storm-1516, and Storm-1841 (aka Rybar).\n\n\"Doppelganger spreads and amplifies fabricated, fake or even legitimate information across social networks,\" French cybersecurity company HarfangLab said. \"To do so, social networks accounts post links that initiate an obfuscated chain of redirections leading to final content websites.\"\n\nHowever, indications are that the propaganda network is shifting its tactics in response to aggressive enforcement, increasingly using non-political posts and ads and spoofing non-political and entertainment news outlets like Cosmopolitan, The New Yorker, and Entertainment Weekly in an attempt to evade detection, per Meta.\n\nThe posts contain links that, when tapped, redirect users to a Russia war- or geopolitics-related article on one of the counterfeit domains mimicking entertainment or health publications. The ads are created using compromised accounts.\n\nThe social media company, which has disrupted 39 influence operations from Russia, 30 from Iran, and 11 from China since 2017 across its platforms, said it uncovered six new networks from Russia (4), Vietnam (1), and the U.S. (1) in the second quarter of 2024.\n\n\"Since May, Doppelganger resumed its attempts at sharing links to its domains, but at a much lower rate,\" Meta said. \"We've also seen them experiment with multiple redirect hops including TinyURL's link-shortening service to hide the final destination behind the links and deceive both Meta and our users in an attempt to avoid detection and lead people to their off-platform websites.\"\n\nThe development comes as Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) also said this week that it had detected and disrupted Iranian-backed spear-phishing efforts aimed at compromising the personal accounts of high-profile users in Israel and the U.S., including those associated with the U.S. presidential campaigns.\n\nThe activity has been attributed to a threat actor codenamed APT42, a state-sponsored hacking crew affiliated with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). It's known to share overlaps with another intrusion set known as Charming Kitten (aka Mint Sandstorm).\n\n\"APT42 uses a variety of different tactics as part of their email phishing campaigns \u2014 including hosting malware, phishing pages, and malicious redirects,\" the tech giant said. \"They generally try to abuse services like Google (i.e. Sites, Drive, Gmail, and others), Dropbox, OneDrive and others for these purposes.\"\n\nThe broad strategy is to gain the trust of their targets using sophisticated social engineering techniques with the goal of getting them off their email and into instant messaging channels like Signal, Telegram, or WhatsApp, before pushing bogus links that are designed to collect their login information.\n\nThe phishing attacks are characterized by the use of tools like GCollection (aka LCollection or YCollection) and DWP to gather credentials from Google, Hotmail, and Yahoo users, Google noted, highlighting APT42's \"strong understanding of the email providers they target.\"\n\n\"Once APT42 gains access to an account, they often add additional mechanisms of access including changing recovery email addresses and making use of features that allow applications that do not support multi-factor authentication like application-specific passwords in Gmail and third-party app passwords in Yahoo,\" it added.\n\nUpdate\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies have formally accused Iran of attempting to undermine U.S. elections, stoke divisive opinion among the American public, and erode confidence in the electoral process, describing Iranian activity as \"increasingly aggressive.\"\n\n\"Iran has furthermore demonstrated a longstanding interest in exploiting societal tensions through various means, including through the use of cyber operations to attempt to gain access to sensitive information related to U.S. elections,\" the agencies said in an assessment.\n\n\"The Iranians have through social engineering and other efforts sought access to individuals with direct access to the Presidential campaigns of both political parties. Such activity, including thefts and disclosures, are intended to influence the U.S. election process.\"\n\nThe findings affirms and expands on a series of reports released by Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI that revealed attempts made by Iran to interfere with the U.S. presidential election that's less than three months away by amplifying propaganda and gathering political intelligence.\n\nIn a statement shared with the Associated Press, Iran's mission to the United Nations denied the allegations as \"unsubstantiated and devoid of any standing,\" saying that Iran had neither the motive nor intention to interfere with the election.",

        "text": "As Trump's policy proposals shift, Harris' begin to emerge in 2024 presidential election\nFormer President Donald Trump touted a list of 20 campaign promises Tuesday, in a Truth Social post and a takeover of his website landing page.\n\nWhile Vice President Kamala Harris did not start revealing her agenda details until Friday, Trump has been associated with several platforms this election cycle alone.\n\nIn 2022, he started releasing videos and statements titled Agenda47. As Democrats started drumming up fear around Project 2025, the Republican National Committee released its official platform, which Trump put forward along with \"20 Core Promises to Make America Great Again.\" That doesn't include the campaign trail tangents, like teasing a 20% universal tariff, which he mentioned in North Carolina this week.\n\nPolicy platform and messaging changes are common throughout a presidential election, says Northeastern University political science professor Costas Panagopoulos. He explained that the platforms today tend to be a blueprint for the kinds of things the party may want to do, but should be taken with a grain of salt.\n\n\"I think the scaled back nature of the Republican platform reflects in part, the fact that Donald Trump himself seems to think that these documents are essentially toothless and that voters may not be so interested in the intricacies of policy substance, so the message has been distilled and simplified in many ways,\" he said.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nHere is what to know about the evolution of Trump's platforms:\n\nMore:More than Donald Trump's opponent: Here are some of Kamala Harris' campaign promises\n\nAgenda47\n\nTrump began releasing videos and statements detailing his policy plans in 2022, throughout a primary season where he faced quickly-defeated challengers including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.\n\nThe plans include many proposals through the form of executive action to tackle crime, education, healthcare immigration, the economy, and more.\n\nSome of those ideas were attention-grabbers, like issuing the death sentence to drug dealers or creating a credentialing body to certify teachers in patriotism. Yet several issue areas such as healthcare were still not comprehensive.\n\nAgenda47 landing pages on Trump's campaign websites were later replaced with the RNC platform, but still remain online.\n\nProject 2025\n\nProject 2025, also known as 2025 Presidential Transition Project, was published by the conservative think tank Heritage Foundation in April 2023.\n\nAs Democrats raised alarm bells about some extreme policy proposals included in the document, Trump attempted to distance himself from it, but many who were involved in the playbook's creations have ties to Trump and his first administration.\n\nWhile the 900-page proposal goes into much more detail than the other platforms, it includes some similar themes, including border security, curbing transgender rights, and energy dominance.\n\nRNC 'Make America Great Again'\n\nAhead of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in July, the committee endorsed a platform that mirrored Trump's popular campaign points from the top down with a \"Make America Great Again\" slogan-turned title.\n\nThe preamble leaned heavily into the \"America First\" policies, arguing to secure the southern border, bring manufacturing back to the U.S., boost domestic energy production, and have a strong military.\n\nAbortion was notably largely left off the document, suggesting policy decisions should be left with the states as Trump avoided calling for a national abortion ban earlier this year.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s 20 CORE PROMISES TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\n\nTrump's 20 Core Promises are included in the bigger RNC 'Make America Great Again' platform. The GOP introduces the platform as \"a forward-looking Agenda that begins with the following twenty promises that we will accomplish very quickly when we win the White House and Republican Majorities in the House and Senate.\"\n\nTrump touted this list after an interview with Elon Musk on Monday.\n\nSeal the border and stop the migrant invasion\n\nCarry out the largest deportation operation in American history\n\nEnd inflation, and make America affordable again\n\nMake America the dominant energy producer in the world, by far!\n\nStop outsourcing, and turn the United States into a manufacturing superpower\n\nLarge tax cuts for workers, and no tax on tips\n\nDefend our Constitution, our bill of rights, and our fundamental freedoms, including freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and the right to keep and bear arms\n\nPrevent World War Three, restore peace in Europe and in the middle east, and build a great iron dome missile defense shield over our entire country -- all made in America\n\nEnd the weaponization of government against the American people\n\nStop the migrant crime epidemic, demolish the foreign drug cartels, crush gang violence, and lock up violent offenders\n\nRebuild our cities, including Washington D.C., making them safe, clean, and beautiful again.\n\nStrengthen and modernize our military, making it, without question, the strongest and most powerful in the world\n\nKeep the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency\n\nFight for and protect social security and Medicare with no cuts, including no changes to the retirement age\n\nCancel the electric vehicle mandate and cut costly and burdensome regulations\n\nCut federal funding for any school pushing critical race theory, radical gender ideology, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children\n\nKeep men out of women's sports\n\nDeport pro-Hamas radicals and make our college campuses safe and patriotic again\n\nSecure our elections, including same day voting, voter identification, paper ballots, and proof of citizenship\n\nUnite our country by bringing it to new and record levels of success\n\nKamala Harris begins platform rollout with economic plan\n\nTrump has used many of his political speeches criticizing the Biden administration and waging personal attacks on Harris, even as some GOP leaders try to focus on her policies.\n\nHarris started detailing her policy agenda starting with an economic plan ahead of a rally in North Carolina Friday. She proposed a federal ban on price gouging on food and groceries, up to $25,000 in assistance for first-time home buyers, and providing a tax incentive to builders to construct more starter homes.\n\nPanagopoulos said the rest of the Democratic platform is not out yet as they are typically adopted at the convention (though the Republicans endorsed their platforms ahead of their convention).\n\nThe Democratic National Convention is scheduled to take place in Chicago from Monday Aug. 19 until Thursday Aug. 22.",

        "text": "What the Latest Presidential Polls Say and What They Might Be Missing\nOn Saturday, the New York Times and Siena College released their latest round of swing-state polling on the Presidential race. It showed Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump by five points in Arizona and by two points in North Carolina, while trailing Trump by a point in Nevada and by four points in Georgia. (In 2020, Joe Biden edged out Trump in all of these states except North Carolina.) The cumulative results show a very slight Harris edge. Coupled with the previous set of Times/Siena polls\u2014which had Harris leading Trump by four points across three battleground states in the Rust Belt (Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan)\u2014the over-all picture of the race has transformed since President Biden stepped aside from contesting the Democratic nomination in July. Harris is narrowly ahead.\n\nTo talk about what it all means, I recently spoke by phone with Nate Cohn, the Times\u2019 chief political analyst who also oversees the paper\u2019s polling. (Full disclosure: Cohn and I worked together at The New Republic, and are friends.) During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed the surprising ways in which Harris\u2019s coalition appears to differ from Biden\u2019s in 2020, how to think about the Sun Belt versus the Rust Belt, and the prospect of a third straight Presidential election with serious polling error.\n\nYou decided to do these polls in two rounds, one in the Rust Belt and then one in the Sun Belt. Why did you make that decision, and do you think it\u2019s helpful for people who are following the election to separate those two areas in their minds?\n\nWell, there\u2019s one practical reason, which is that it is difficult for us to simultaneously and quickly field surveys in seven states. This is a really dynamic race, and so, if we had polled all seven of these simultaneously, we might\u2019ve had to field over ten days, and I think there would\u2019ve been some valid questions about whether the results that we had at the end were still reflective of the race as it is today.\n\nThere\u2019s also a substantive reason, which is that the Sun Belt and Rust Belt states, if we can call them that, have been very different this cycle. The Northern battleground states are relatively white, and the polls this cycle have shown Democrats faring relatively well among white voters. As a consequence, even Joe Biden was fairly competitive there. The Sun Belt states, on the other hand, are relatively diverse, and the polls have shown Democrats faring relatively poorly among nonwhite voters this cycle. As a consequence, Donald Trump had a significant lead in the Sun Belt battleground states even as the Rust Belt states remained competitive. So I think there was a pretty good reason to be treating them separately, even beyond the practical reasons.\n\nWhen you\u2019re looking at these polls, either in the three Rust Belt states [Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan] or the four Sun Belt states [Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, and North Carolina], are you looking at the individual states very closely? Or are you grouping them together in your mind and averaging them out?\n\nBoth. Obviously individual states are idiosyncratic, and they can go in their own distinct ways. On the other hand, these two groups of states have a lot in common, and they voted fairly similarly four years ago, and, when we put them all together, we have a larger sample size. So those estimates can be more stable, while the individual states can bounce around. When you\u2019re looking at a single poll, it can be a little challenging to figure out whether you\u2019re looking at something that\u2019s genuinely unique about that state or a thing that\u2019s weird about a smaller sample.\n\nIf you take the four Sun Belt states together, you get Kamala Harris ahead by four-tenths of a point. That happens to be the exact result of the 2020 election across those four states. So I see a result that in some ways is profoundly unsurprising. It\u2019s almost exactly what we would\u2019ve guessed two years ago, but it also represents a huge change from earlier in the year when Trump had a large lead across these diverse states.\n\nNow that you\u2019ve been able to do several rounds of polls, what do you feel comfortable saying demographically about how this race is different from when Biden was running, but also compared to Biden in 2020?\n\nIn May, we had Trump ahead by five points across the battleground states. Right now, we have Harris ahead by two, so it\u2019s a big seven-point swing. And we show outsized gains for Harris among young and nonwhite voters, and women, and we show smaller gains, but still some improvement, for Harris among men and white voters.\n\nNow, what\u2019s interesting is that, compared to 2020, Harris is still slightly underperforming where Biden finished among young, Black, and Hispanic voters, even though she\u2019s doing better than he was three months ago. We have Harris doing a little bit better among white voters and older voters than Biden did in 2020. It\u2019s possible that this just reflects a continuation of a longer-term trend during the last decade toward somewhat less racial polarization. It\u2019s possible this will change as the campaign continues. Maybe some of the white working-class voters who have seen three weeks of great coverage for Harris, and particularly white working-class women, will eventually turn against her as the campaign goes on. It\u2019s a really unique political moment.\n\nRight, there have been so many headlines about Harris picking up support from young voters and Black voters and Hispanic voters, but that\u2019s just compared to how Biden was doing with those groups in the polls. And it is pretty striking when you say that, compared to the actual result of the last Presidential election, she\u2019s actually doing better among white and older voters and worse among all those other groups.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely not what we would\u2019ve guessed two or three years ago. If you told me that Harris, a Black and Indian younger woman, was not going to have any material advantage over Biden among Black and Hispanic voters in the 2020 election, that would\u2019ve surprised me. I do think that we need to see this race settle out a bit before we can say why that\u2019s true and whether it\u2019s going to last. I really do think it\u2019s conceivable that Harris is riding an extraordinary wave of momentum that inflates her numbers just a little bit among swing voters across the board, and that might come back to earth. And ultimately there may be some room for her to make additional gains among Black and Latino voters as the campaign goes on.\n\nYour current poll has largish gaps between Arizona and Nevada and then also between North Carolina and Georgia. I think most people assume that those gaps will end up being pretty close on Election Day.\n\nWell, I certainly share that expectation. Arizona and Nevada have a large Latino population. Georgia and North Carolina have large Black populations. So you would expect those two groups of states to move somewhat in tandem. But it\u2019s worth noting that that\u2019s not necessarily what has been happening over the last decade. Democrats have made big gains in Arizona and Georgia while they have made few gains in Nevada and North Carolina. So it is conceivable that these states can move independently. Still, I don\u2019t think our polling should necessarily be taken as a definitive claim that North Carolina is now going to vote to the left of Georgia or Arizona will vote far to the left of Nevada, not by any stretch.\n\nWe have the most to say about Georgia and Arizona because we\u2019ve done a lot of polls in those states by now. The previous times that we\u2019ve polled Arizona and Georgia this cycle, they weren\u2019t that much different from the battlegrounds as a whole. But in this poll both those states diverged from where they\u2019ve been in our prior polling. Georgia is now well to the right of the other states. Arizona is now to the left. My instinct is that this is probably just a little bit of random noise. I think that if we polled those two states again tomorrow, there\u2019s a pretty darn good chance we would find Arizona closer to even, and Georgia closer to even.",

Josh Hsu, formerly from the vice president\u2019s office, will join the team, and Vanita Gupta, a former director of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and a top Biden Justice Department official, is an informal adviser.\n\nThe campaign will also lean on the top lawyers at three prominent law firms \u2014 Seth Waxman, Donald Verrilli and John Devaney \u2014 to handle litigation, and deploy local counsel to eight battleground states and four other states of interest.",

        "text": "Kamala Harris releases economic plan aiming to lower housing costs, end price gouging\nVice President Kamala Harris unveiled her economic plans Friday in Raleigh, North Carolina, marking the first time she has released a major policy initiative since President Biden dropped out of the race last month.\n\nNorth Carolina is a key battleground state in November, and Harris is trying to persuade voters there and across the country that her policies can bring costs down and give Americans economic opportunity. Harris noted it was her 16th visit to the state since becoming vice president \u2014 and President Biden's first stop after the fateful debate performance that ultimately led to his departure from the race.\n\nHarris said she would offer more details about her economic plan in the weeks ahead but on Friday, she focused efforts to lower the cost of living.\n\n\"When I am elected president, I will make it a top priority to bring down costs and increase economic security for all Americans,\" Harris said at Wake Tech Community College in Raleigh. \"As president, I will take on the high costs that matter most to most Americans, like the cost of food. We all know that prices went up during the pandemic when the supply chains shut down and failed. But our supply chains have now improved. And prices are still too high.\"\n\nHarris also blasted former President Donald Trump over his economic policies. She said Trump would impose \"what is in effect a national sales tax,\" referring to recent remarks Trump made about expanding tariffs on goods imported into the U.S. by 10-20%.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris speaks at a campaign event at Hendrick Center for Automotive Excellence on the Scott Northern Wake Campus of Wake Tech Community College in Raleigh, N.C., Friday, Aug. 16, 2024. Mike Stewart / AP\n\nNew housing\n\nHarris is calling for the construction of 3 million new housing units in her first four years in office. The Biden administration has previously called for the construction of 2 million new homes.\n\nShe wants to incentivize these new units with a tax break for builders who construct properties for first-time home buyers. She is also proposing a $40 billion fund to help local governments find solutions to the lack of housing supply.\n\n\"There's a serious housing shortage. In many places, it's too difficult to build, and it's driving prices up,\" Harris said. \"As president, I will work in partnership with industry to build the housing we need, both to rent and to buy. We will take down barriers and cut red tape, including at the state and local levels. And by the end of my first term, we will end America's housing shortage by building 3 million new homes and rentals that are affordable for the middle class.\"\n\nCampaign officials said Harris will call on Congress to pass the Preventing the Algorithmic Facilitation of Rental Housing Cartels Act, which would prevent landlords from using price-fixing algorithms to increase rents. She also wants lawmakers to pass the Stop Predatory Investing Act, a bill that would limit tax breaks for large investors and private equity firms that acquire single-family rental homes in bulk.\n\n\"Some corporate landlords, some of them, buy dozens if not hundreds of houses and apartments,\" Harris said. \"Then they turn them around and rent them out at extremely high prices. And it can make it impossible then for regular people to buy or even rent a home.\"\n\nHarris will also propose providing Americans who have paid their rent on time for two years with up to $25,000 in down-payment assistance, with more support for first-generation homeowners.\n\nExpansion of Child Tax Credit\n\nHarris is also proposing an expansion of the Child Tax Credit to provide a $6,000 tax cut to families with newborns. GOP vice presidential nominee and Ohio Sen. JD Vance has proposed a similar but more general $5,000 Child Tax Credit expansion. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget pointed out that this Vance's proposal, which is 150% above the current $2,000 tax credit, could mean creating trillions in debt. \"We could easily be talking about $2-$3 trillion in additional borrowing over the next decade,\" Marc Goldwein, senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, told CBS MoneyWatch regarding the Vance proposal.\n\nVance has suggested his tax credit would not be subject to income thresholds, while Harris' proposal would apply to lower- and middle-income families.\n\nTrump campaign senior adviser Brian Hughes said there's been \"a lot of talk from the Harris campaign criticizing Senator Vance and campaign for advocating for policies that are pro-family and meant to support those who are raising children. So it is a bit ironic to see the Vice President Harris suddenly embrace policies that she seemed to stop at just a few weeks ago.\"\n\nHarris also wants to restore the Child Tax Credit to the pandemic-era American Rescue Plan levels, which would give working- and middle-class families with children up to $3,600 per child.\n\nShe is also proposing a Earned Income Tax Credit of $1,500 for those in lower-income jobs who aren't raising a child. The campaign also emphasized that Harris will ensure \"no one earning less than $400,000 a year will pay more in new taxes.\"\n\nBoth Vance's and Harris' proposals would require congressional approval.\n\nAddressing inflation\n\nIn North Carolina, Harris also talked about how much higher prices are for specific goods like bread than they were pre-pandemic, something Mr. Biden has typically been less likely to do.\n\nIn the first 100 days of her administration, Harris, according to a campaign fact sheet, would work to bring down the cost of groceries by working with Congress on a federal ban on price gouging on groceries and other goods and new authorities for the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general to enable them to impose penalties on rule-breaking companies.\n\n\"Look, the bills add up,\" Harris said Friday. \"Food, rent, gas, back to school clothes, prescription medication \u2014 after all that, for many families, there's not much left at the end of the month.\"\n\nExtreme consolidation in the food industry has led to higher prices that account for a large part of higher grocery bills. Harris plans to crack down on unfair mergers and acquisitions that give big food corporations the power to jack up food and grocery prices and undermine the competition that keeps prices low for consumers. And her plan aims to support smaller businesses, like grocery stores, meat processors, farmers and ranchers, so those industries can be more competitive.\n\nAccording to the most recent CBS News poll, only 9% of registered voters rated the condition of the national economy as \"very good,\" with the economy and inflation ranking as the top issue of concern consistently across 2024 polls. Inflation has cooled since its peak in June 2022, but many voters are still feeling financial strain. Prices are still 20% higher overall than prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn a statement, the Trump campaign accused Harris of trying to implement price controls, which it said \"have been tried \u2014 and failed \u2014 throughout history as they inevitably lead to food lines, shortages, and skyrocketing inequality.\" The Trump campaign also blamed Harris' and Mr. Biden's economic policies for creating the problem, \"aided and abetted by Harris's tiebreaking votes on trillions in inflationary spending.\" However, economists have said that pandemic-related federal spending by both Trump and Mr. Biden fueled high inflation.\n\nThroughout battleground states, voters often tell CBS News that the economy remains a top issue when heading to the voting booths.\n\n\"Workforce development, creating job opportunities, making sure everyone can advance in different career fields,\" said Abraham Camejo in Las Vegas ahead of Harris' rally on Saturday when asked about economic priorities. \"The policies that benefit big corporations and the middle class are different.\"\n\nAccording to a recent CBS News poll, on a question about policies that will improve people's finances, Harris trailed Trump with 45% of registered voters saying they'd be financially better off with the former president, compared to 25% for Harris.\n\nEliminating taxes on tips\n\nHarris' economic policy remarks followed her pledge last Saturday at a rally in Las Vegas to eliminate taxes on tips and raise the minimum wage.\n\n\"When I am president, we will continue our fight for working families including to raise the minimum wage and eliminate taxes on tips for service and hospitality workers,\" Harris said recently at a rally that included Nevada Culinary union members.\n\nA Harris-Walz campaign official noted that her pledge would require legislation.\n\nThis marked the first time Harris made a proposal on eliminating taxes on tips for service workers, a similar idea to one first pitched by Trump in June, also at a rally in Las Vegas.\n\nIn 2025, lawmakers are set to have a major opening on tax legislation given the expiration of some tax changes made during Trump's presidency in 2017. Control of Congress is likely to be a major factor on this issue, since Republicans held the House, Senate and White House when Trump's 2017 tax cuts became law.\n\ncontributed to this report.",

Close Ties With Police: AP3 leaders have forged alliances with law enforcement around the U.S. Internal files reveal their strategies for building these ties and where they\u2019ve claimed success. These highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.\n\nLast February, some 20 men and their wives gathered for dinner at an upscale restaurant in Spokane, Washington, for their annual Valentine\u2019s Day celebration. The men weren\u2019t just friends; they did community service work together. They had been featured on local television, in khakis and baseball caps, delivering 1,200 pounds of food to an area veterans\u2019 center; they were gearing up for their next food drive, which they called Operation Hunger Smash. A few days after the holiday, the men went camping in the snow-speckled mountains outside Spokane, where they grilled rib-eyes and bacon-wrapped asparagus over a bonfire.\n\nThey also engaged in more menacing activities. They assembled regularly \u2014 sometimes wearing night-vision goggles in the dark \u2014 to practice storming buildings together with semiautomatic rifles. Their drills included using sniper rifles to shoot targets from distances of half a mile. And they belonged to a shadowy organization whose members were debating, with ever more intensity, whether they should engage in mass-scale political violence.\n\nThey were among the thousands of members of American Patriots Three Percent, a militia that has long been one of the largest in the United States and has mostly managed to avoid scrutiny. Its ranks included cops and convicted criminals, active-duty U.S. soldiers and small-business owners, truck drivers and health care professionals. Like other militias, AP3 has a vague but militant right-wing ideology, a pronounced sense of grievance and a commitment to armed action. It has already sought to shape American life through vigilante operations: AP3 members have \u201crounded up\u201d immigrants at the Texas border, assaulted Black Lives Matter protesters and attempted to crack down on people casting absentee ballots.\n\nNow with the presidential election less than 100 days away, AP3 members see the fate of their country turning on a turbulent, charged campaign. They\u2019re certain that Democrats will try to steal \u2014 not for the first time, in their view \u2014 the White House from Donald Trump. \u201cThe next election won\u2019t be decided at a Ballot Box,\u201d an AP3 leader wrote several months ago in a private Telegram chat. \u201cIt\u2019ll be decided at the ammo box.\u201d He has said he is ready to force his way into voting centers if need be, or \u201cwhatever it takes.\u201d\n\nThe public\u2019s impression of American militias is dominated by Jan. 6, 2021. Groups such as the Proud Boys had plotted to prevent the transfer of power from Trump to Joe Biden. They formed the vanguard of the mob that stormed the Capitol that day, according to the Department of Justice. Media coverage since has centered on the prosecutions of participants, with hundreds of rioters sent to prison.\n\nBut despite the riot and its fallout, militias are far from extinct. AP3 has expanded at a dramatic pace since Jan. 6, while keeping much of its activity out of view. This rise is documented in more than 100,000 internal messages obtained by ProPublica, spanning the run-up to Jan. 6 through early 2024. Along with extensive interviews with 22 current and former members of AP3, the records provide a uniquely detailed inside view of the militia movement at a crucial moment.\n\nThe messages reveal how AP3 leaders have forged alliances with law enforcement around the country and show the ways in which, despite an initial crackdown by social media, they have attracted a new wave of recruits. A change in the political climate has also helped: In a matter of months after Jan. 6, rioters went from pariahs to heroes in the rhetoric of prominent Republican politicians. By the summer of 2021, people were enlisting in AP3, saying that Jan. 6 inspired them to join.\n\nA portrait emerges of a group alternating between focused action and self-destructive chaos and facing a schism over whether political engagement can still address our nation\u2019s problems \u2014 or whether violence is the only option. It can be hard to discern the line between bluster and imminent threat in the messages, a perennial struggle for FBI agents who monitor paramilitary groups. But some senior AP3 members grew so alarmed that they quit, scared by the number of people, even high-level leaders, advocating acts of terror.\n\nThe materials also shed light on what former national security officials say is the most urgent question regarding militias: Will Jan. 6 prove the high water mark of the movement\u2019s violence or merely a prelude to something more catastrophic? AP3 leaders have sometimes characterized the storming of the Capitol as a botched job, a failure of ill-formed plans that didn\u2019t go far enough. \u201cThe Jan 6 event made the movement look weak and uncommitted,\u201d one wrote a year and a half after the riot in a secret channel. \u201cHad the house been taken for real and held we would all be in a different world.\u201d\n\nThis is the story of a militia fighting for its survival, determined not to make the same mistake twice.\n\nAP3 members train in Washington state. Credit: Obtained by ProPublica\n\n\u201cLife Is Too Fucking Short\u201d\n\nOn a Thursday afternoon in February 2021, Scot Seddon, national commander of AP3, sent an audio message to his deputies in a channel open only to the group\u2019s leadership. A former Army reservist, Seddon had founded AP3 when he was in his 30s and shaped it into a national force. Now he was 50, with a receding hairline, his beard overtaken by gray. In videos from this time, typically recorded in his kitchen, Seddon favored baseball caps and tight shirts that revealed his bulky shoulders and trapezius muscles. He looked like an aging bro who had just returned from the gym. \u201cI hate this movement more every day,\u201d Seddon said that February day, \u201cand I really don\u2019t even want to be a part of it anymore.\u201d\n\nIt had been a few weeks since the Capitol riot. The FBI was already arresting leaders of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, two of AP3\u2019s prominent counterparts. Another militia was about to dissolve. One of Seddon\u2019s lieutenants had issued a dark forecast: The reaction to Jan. 6 could destroy our movement. Everyday Americans will recoil.\n\nSeddon on the Capitol Riot AP3 national commander Scot Seddon, in a video posted on Jan. 6, 2021, claimed that left-wing antifa protesters infiltrated the crowd at the Capitol that day, an assertion dismissed by experts. Credit: Obtained by ProPublica\n\nAt least Seddon didn\u2019t have to fear going to prison. AP3 had spent weeks preparing to go to Washington, D.C., for Biden\u2019s inauguration on Jan. 20, with one of his top deputies promising to \u201cmad max this shit.\u201d Whether through luck, foresight or miscalculation, Seddon had decided to save his forces for that event rather than deploy them at the Jan. 6 rally. Plenty of his members went anyway; some fought with police officers on the Capitol steps. But they were under orders not to wear AP3 insignia, according to two former lieutenants to Seddon, and the organization was never publicly linked to the rioters.\n\nThat did not save AP3 from the fallout. Membership plummeted. AP3ers lost friends and business. Active-duty police officers quit out of fear of losing their jobs.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, AP3\u2019s best recruiting tool was essentially gone: Facebook had cracked down on paramilitary organizing. \u201cFacebook has been our greatest weapon. It\u2019s gotten us where we are today,\u201d Seddon told his troops. He later described those months as a period of personal \u201cmisery\u201d and self-doubt. \u201cI had a drinking problem,\u201d he would confide to the group. \u201cThe bottle was consuming me.\u201d\n\nBy the middle of 2021, some AP3 leaders were ready to give up. In July, the head of its Arizona chapter announced he was stepping down. \u201cMy life is too fucking short to beg people to do what\u2019s right,\u201d he said. He had hardly any members left in his state, and rebuilding was proving impossible. Still, he added, \u201cIt has been a great honor to me to have been here (and stayed here) through some of the most trying times this movement has seen since April 19, 1995.\u201d\n\nSeddon displays the hand signal of the Three Percenters, a loose confederation of right-wing groups that AP3 is affiliated with, in a photo posted in 2023.

It was the day a Gulf War veteran with militia ties named Timothy McVeigh blew up a government building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 people and injuring hundreds more. The modern militia movement \u2014 loosely speaking, a wide variety of groups whose shared traits are military-style training, an affinity for guns and a belief that they are the last line of defense against the excesses of the government and the left \u2014 started in the early 1990s and had been growing rapidly. But after the bombing, the movement crumbled. It didn\u2019t recover until 2008, when a financial crisis and Barack Obama\u2019s presidential election kindled a new generation of leaders like Seddon.\n\nBut the political climate after Jan. 6 would be very different from the period after McVeigh\u2019s attack. Soon, Seddon\u2019s group would have momentum back on its side.\n\nLions and Men\n\nSeddon seems like an unlikely commander of a paramilitary organization. Raised in the suburbs of Long Island, he bounced between jobs through his early 40s, including stints as the manager for a small-time rapper and as a model. Seddon appeared on book jackets, including a vampire romance novel titled \u201cLove\u2019s Last Bite.\u201d And there he was, in an awkward shirtless pose with a woman in lingerie, on the cover of \u201cHow to Handle a Younger Man: A Collection of Five Erotic Stories.\u201d\n\nIt was in internet forums for models, during the latter years of the George W. Bush administration, where Seddon\u2019s right-wing politics started to emerge publicly. He would engage in lengthy sparring with his peers, heckling them with insults: \u201cwe dominate you libs\u201d and \u201cyou SOUND LIKE A FRENCHMEN need I say more?\u201d\n\nSeddon during his days as a model Credit: Screenshot taken by ProPublica via Bookmate.com\n\nSeddon grew increasingly alienated \u2014 he would later say that he felt \u201cvery alone\u201d after Obama was elected \u2014 and engaged. He became active on a Facebook page to support Iraq War veterans. And then, during Obama\u2019s first term, he used that as a launchpad to create AP3. At the time, Seddon did not yet own a firearm, according to one of his first recruits.\n\nLike many militias, AP3 was suffused with a military ethos. It adopted the hierarchy and nomenclature, with ranks such as \u201ccommand sergeant major.\u201d One credential most conferred authority: military service.\n\nSeddon described himself as a veteran and, in a public resume, stated that he had served in Operation Desert Storm. He would tell Army stories to AP3 members and show them a photo of himself as a young soldier. Even his closest confidants in the group were left with the impression that he had substantial military experience.\n\nBut Seddon did not, in fact, serve in a combat zone. He joined the Army Reserve, without any prior stint in the military, more than a year after Desert Storm was over, according to his discharge papers and military personnel records. His active-duty tenure lasted for five months, the documents say, and ended when he finished his initial training.\n\nSeddon\u2019s Army discharge papers, along with military personnel records, show he was on active duty for five months.

Presented with an extensive list of written questions, he responded, \u201cLions do not concern themselves with the opinions of men.\u201d\n\n\u201cJ6 Made Me Want to Join\u201d\n\nSeddon\u2019s vision for AP3 was novel for the time: a national organization, with chapters across the country operating under his command. After Obama announced a plan for tougher gun control in his second term, membership exploded, former leaders said. One told ProPublica that their local chapter grew from four or five people to over 200 in less than a year.\n\nBy 2016, AP3 had an active presence in 48 states, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center \u2014 larger than any other organization the anti-extremism watchdog was tracking. AP3 was part of the loose confederation known as the Three Percenters, a set of right-wing groups that take their name from the claim that only 3% of colonists fought in the American Revolution. At its peak, by Seddon\u2019s likely exaggerated count, AP3 had 40,000 to 50,000 members. After the Jan. 6 riot, insiders and experts estimate the total was, at most, in the low thousands.\n\nSeddon set about rebuilding the group in 2021. It was difficult initially and made even harder by his own struggles. When the pandemic started, he had a job as a doctor\u2019s technician in New York City, but he refused to get vaccinated and left the medical field. He tried to get licensed as a realtor, then as a personal trainer, and found gig economy work near Scranton, Pennsylvania. He often recorded video directives to his troops from his car while driving between deliveries for Uber Eats.\n\nHe began reinvigorating the remnants of his command. His communications offered a mix of elements that his followers found compelling. There was lots of posturing: \u201cFuck the federal government,\u201d he offered as an opener in one video. \u201cThese rats, these devils,\u201d he said in another, \u201cthe only way they\u2019re going to start listening is fear.\u201d But Seddon also hailed his members as patriots, heroes, and praised their deeds with an \u201cawesome job bro.\u201d Seddon traveled the country. He would drop by at AP3\u2019s training exercises, where veterans might teach close-quarters gun combat at an abandoned car dealership or lead sniper rifle practice at a suburban ranch.\n\n\u201cYou Should Be a Monster\u201d An excerpt from an AP3 recruiting video Credit: Obtained by ProPublica\n\nRecruiting new members and unifying the old ones \u2014 a disparate roster that brought together men with white nationalist ties and Black military vets \u2014 demanded constant effort. Seddon avoided getting pinned down on one controversial question: what precisely his group\u2019s purpose was. \u201cResisting all efforts to undermine our constitution and the American way of life,\u201d AP3\u2019s mission statement read, at once lofty and vague. \u201cTogether we will return our country to the glory it once was.\u201d Many members were furious about COVID-19 restrictions and the \u201cLGBTQ agenda.\u201d Gun control, they thought, was an injustice that might be worth dying over. But Seddon imposed no litmus test. \u201cWe have some [members] that are fixated on Muslims,\u201d as one leader put it. \u201cMost are fixated on Antifa and BLM.\u201d\n\nUnder Seddon, AP3 was both an armed right-wing resistance group and something akin to a Rotary Club; camaraderie was as important a draw as ideology. AP3 members patrolled city streets with AR-15-style rifles and baseball bats during Black Lives Matters protests. They practiced attacking dummies with knives. But they also taught each other how to save money on groceries through gardening and organized seminars where they wrote reports on each Constitutional amendment. One member said the group dispatched trucks filled with clothes and furniture to his family after a wildfire destroyed their house. AP3 had its own monthly magazine, with militia news in the front pages and word games for kids in the back.\n\nAP3 is both an armed right-wing resistance group and something akin to a Rotary Club; camaraderie is as important a draw as ideology. In chats, members shared images of everything from their weapons to their gardening successes. Credit: Obtained by ProPublica. The photo of a person with an American flag on his chest was cropped.\n\nBy August 2021, Seddon\u2019s lieutenants noticed that the backlash to the Capitol riot was starting to dissipate. A new type of member was signing up. \u201cJ6 made me want to join,\u201d a recruit wrote that month in a Telegram channel. He hadn\u2019t been part of a militia before, he explained, but seeing how \u201ctrue Patriots\u201d were being treated, \u201cit was time to actually do something.\u201d\n\nSeddon sought ways to capitalize on the improving political climate. In Alabama, members fanned out to shops around the state, where they dropped off stacks of business cards encouraging patriots to \u201cdo your part.\u201d \u201cThe APIII Alabama Recruitment line has rang non stop today,\u201d a leader reported back afterward. \u201cI honestly wasn\u2019t expecting it to get this big.\u201d\n\nIn Washington state, AP3 members in the military reserves touted the militia to fellow reservists during their units\u2019 regular monthly drills. One chapter looked into purchasing billboard ads. In internal chats, many members agreed the \u201cbest place to recruit\u201d is Veterans Affairs facilities.\n\nBy the fall, they had arrived at a more efficient method. Facebook\u2019s public posture hadn\u2019t wavered. AP3 was still on its list of banned \u201cdangerous organizations.\u201d Again and again in press releases, the company said its efforts to combat militias were stronger than ever.\n\nInside AP3, though, leaders were seeing something different: The social media giant was gradually loosening its controls.\n\nA Meta spokesperson said Facebook was still actively working to keep AP3 off its platform. \u201cThis is an adversarial space,\u201d she said, \u201cand we often see instances of groups or individuals taking on new tactics to avoid detection and evade our policies and enforcement.\u201d\n\nSeddon would soon tell leaders there were \u201chuge opportunities to recruit using Facebook\u201d again. AP3 experienced such an influx of aspiring members that leaders struggled to keep up. \u201cGUYS WE REALLY NEED SOME HELP,\u201d one of Seddon\u2019s deputies wrote in a typical appeal in an internal chat. \u201cGOT 175 PEOPLE WAITING TO GET IN.\u201d\n\nIt was a sorely needed shot of adrenaline.\n\n\u201cOur Force Multiplier\u201d\n\nThe cover of the February 2022 issue of AP3\u2019s magazine Credit: Obtained by ProPublica\n\nIn the view of many AP3 leaders, their chances of success hinged on building alliances with another heavily armed sector of society: police and sheriffs\u2019 departments. If they couldn\u2019t get the agencies to fight alongside them, they at least needed the cops to leave them alone. Many organizations like AP3 share this approach; a leaked FBI counterterrorism guide from 2015 noted that investigations of \u201cmilitia extremists\u201d often find \u201cactive links to law enforcement officers.\u201d The details of those efforts rarely come into public view.\n\nOne test of that strategy occurred in Kenosha, Wisconsin, as the prosecution of Kyle Rittenhouse was winding to a close in 2021. When Black Lives Matter protests and civil unrest overtook Kenosha the year before, Rittenhouse had ventured into the scrum with a semiautomatic rifle and killed two people. Prosecutors called it murder; Rittenhouse called it self-defense. Within AP3, he\u2019d become a folk hero. \u201cKyle represents every one of us,\u201d one leader said.\n\nIn September 2021, with Rittenhouse\u2019s trial two months away, AP3 leaders were preparing for what would happen after the verdict. If he were acquitted, there might be riots in Kenosha. And if there were riots, the militia might deploy a team that could be in the same position as Rittenhouse had been in, walking armed into a volatile situation. They wanted local law enforcement on their side.\n\nThe head of AP3\u2019s Wisconsin chapter, a truck driver, had already contacted the Kenosha County sheriff. He\u2019d invited a couple of local officers over for beers, too. The sheriff wasn\u2019t interested in help from a militia, the chapter head reported in an internal chat. (The sheriff did not respond to attempts to seek comment.) Seddon told him he wasn\u2019t trying hard enough: \u201cI hate these kind of excuses.\u201d\n\nA man wears an AP3 patch at a rally with the Proud Boys in Portland, Oregon, in 2020. Credit: Maranie R. Staab/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOn Sept. 20, Seddon recorded a speech with more full-throated instructions for courting law enforcement. He already had officers as members: One AP3 leader in Alabama would send video messages while driving in his police uniform. Seddon wanted to move up the chain of command. \u201cWe need to pick the good apples and we need to have them infiltrate the minds of those on the inside that stand on the fence,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like building an army.\u201d\n\nHe knew that was harder to achieve when you\u2019re seen as anti-government extremists. So Seddon had created a playbook for presenting AP3 as a misunderstood club for good Samaritans. Leaders encouraged members to get local police departments involved in AP3\u2019s food drives for homeless people. Seddon emphasized that these community service projects, a source of pride for many members, were invaluable public relations coups.\n\nHis members distributed brochures \u2014 \u201cWE ARE NOT A MILITIA!!!!!\u201d they declared \u2014 at rallies and to police officers. This was a branding decision to make people like cops feel comfortable supporting or joining AP3, Seddon said in internal messages, even though \u201cwe all know better.\u201d\n\nSeddon pushed members to contact sheriffs in their regions and had his deputies send Excel spreadsheets to the militia\u2019s rank and file. The documents listed every sheriff in each member\u2019s state, with columns to mark whether they were Republicans and \u201cfriendly.\u201d\n\nSometimes it came easily. During the 2022 election, the county where Burley Ross, head of AP3\u2019s North Carolina chapter, lived had an open seat for sheriff. In an interview with ProPublica, Ross said he approached both candidates and asked: If the federal government wanted you to take someone\u2019s guns, what would you do?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 100% not taking someone\u2019s guns,\u201d Scott Hammonds, the Republican candidate, responded, according to Ross. When his Democratic opponent said he\u2019d enforce the law, Ross suggested that if he tried that, someone would leave the encounter in a body bag.\n\nHammonds won. Then as sheriff, he became an \u201coff the books\u201d member of AP3, according to messages Ross sent in internal chats. Some of Hammonds\u2019 deputies started training with the group, Ross wrote. \u201cFor us to train with the deputies, that\u2019s a plus for us,\u201d he told ProPublica, \u201cbecause we understand how they work.\u201d ProPublica could not independently confirm Hammonds\u2019 relationship with the group. Hammonds did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\n\n(Weeks after publication, on Oct. 10, 2024, Hammonds told ProPublica he had no relationship with AP3 and he didn\u2019t know Ross. \u201cI speak not on anything but what the Constitution protects,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not AP3. I\u2019m not any kind of militia.\u201d)\n\nBurley Ross was head of AP3\u2019s North Carolina chapter. Credit: Obtained by ProPublica\n\nPolice officers weren\u2019t the only ones quietly allying with AP3. Some lawmakers did, too. Among them was a North Carolina state legislator who was an off-the-books member, Ross wrote in an internal chat. It was Keith Kidwell, leader of the state House Freedom Caucus. (Ross asked ProPublica to make clear he did not name Kidwell or Hammonds in interviews and that ProPublica identified them using the AP3 messages it obtained. Kidwell did not respond to requests for comment.)\n\nAP3\u2019s \u201ccommanding officer\u201d in Oklahoma, Ed Eubanks, took an especially calculated approach to cultivating ties with police. A competitive shooter who said he\u2019d been a sniper in the Special Forces, Eubanks was older than most in the militia, in his 60s and retired. He was an \u201coutcast\u201d in his liberal family, he wrote to a group of about 100 militia members, echoing a common theme in the group. He had a lot of time to dedicate to AP3.\n\nEubanks announced in a 2021 internal chat that he was setting up \u201ca PR team to start making inroads\u201d with law enforcement across Oklahoma. He let officers use shooting ranges on his property. He built a barbecue smoker with \u201cAPIII\u201d on the side to use for meet-and-greets with police departments. It was just the sort of creativity Seddon was hoping for.\n\nThe barbecue smoker (as it was being constructed) that Ed Eubanks built to use for meet-and-greets with police departments Credit: Obtained by ProPublica\n\nEubanks would claim success with multiple law enforcement agencies, particularly the Oklahoma City police force. Messages from 2020 show the courtship in its beginnings. Eubanks described his plans to stage a counterprotest at an upcoming \u201cdefund the police\u201d rally in Oklahoma City in order to \u201cbuild a better relationship with the OKCPD.\u201d After the rally, Eubanks reported that he had made connections with city police officers who would be giving him intel (and barbecue \u2014 they\u2019d invited AP3 members to a cookout at police union headquarters after the event).\n\nIn the years that followed, the invitations to functions at the union lodge continued, according to messages from Eubanks and another AP3 member. Eubanks said police notified him when rallies were happening and that the militia got \u201cminute by minute updates\u201d from officers at some events.\n\nA spokesperson for the Oklahoma City police department said it was \u201cgoing to pass\u201d on a request for an interview and did not respond to detailed written questions. Mark Nelson, president of the local Fraternal Order of Police, said that AP3 was never invited to an official union event, but that officers can host private events at the union lodge and he would \u201chave no idea\u201d who was invited. In response to detailed questions, Eubanks declined to comment.\n\nOne of Eubanks\u2019 members said he pretended to be a Black Lives Matter supporter at one protest in the city because police had asked AP3 to embed a member inside BLM and report back. \u201cThe demonic presence there when the leaders showed up,\u201d the member wrote, \u201cwas downright oppressive.\u201d\n\nProPublica could not determine the full extent of AP3\u2019s ties to the Oklahoma City police, but Eubanks contended in a message that his efforts were \u201cworth every second.\u201d As he put it in another message, \u201cThis will be our force multiplier when the time arises.\u201d\n\nAP3 members, left, foreground, at a county GOP dinner in Washington state in late 2021 Credit: Obtained by ProPublica\n\nAP3 on Patrol\n\nBy mid-2022, Seddon was growing ebullient. He\u2019d toned down his drinking, he told his comrades. In videos, he looked clean cut and slimmed down. Recruiting was booming, with as many as 50 people applying each day. His members were providing security details for county GOP events again. And the militia\u2019s first major operation since the Capitol riot was well underway.\n\nSeddon had sounded a call to arms in late 2021. Illegal border crossings were surging, and the Texas governor had declared that his state was \u201cabandoned\u201d by the federal government. \u201cOur country is being invaded at the Southern border,\u201d Seddon said. \u201cHaitians, Middle Easterners, South American invaders that are coming in.\u201d He had about 20 members preparing to deploy to Quemado, Texas, he said, and was seeking more volunteers.\n\nAnyone interested would need to bring an AR-15-style carbine and a semiautomatic pistol. They would conduct vigilante patrols, a regular feature at the border since the 1970s. Another leader explained the rules. \u201cIt is a felony to detain these folks under Texas law,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can only report to the authorities, but we are allowed to carry live rounds.\u201d\n\nMany members said they didn\u2019t want to go if they couldn\u2019t kill migrants. \u201c\u200b\u200bThe most heard comment I get\u201d is \u201cthere is only one way to stop them,\u201d one leader told Seddon. AP3 joined forces with another militia and soon had members in Quemado, sleeping at a Christian charity 1,000 feet from the Rio Grande.\n\nThe charity\u2019s leaders, terrified of the Mexican cartels that helped transport some migrants, were initially grateful for the support. They put the militiamen up in twin bunk beds in little rooms that resembled a hospital ward. AP3 would keep a presence at the border for at least the next year and a half. Their members caught migrants and turned them over to the authorities. In time, messages claim, they were patrolling over 10,000 acres of land.\n\nEubanks helped lead the operation. At night, he\u2019d split members up to cover more ground. Then he would don camouflage fatigues and venture alone into the pitch darkness, a shotgun in his hand.\n\nFirst image: A room where AP3 members stayed in Quemado, Texas. Second image: Ed Eubanks near the border. Third image: A small vehicle used by AP3 members for their patrols. Credit: Obtained by ProPublica\n\nIn internal chats, Eubanks bragged about the allies they\u2019d cultivated, including Brad Coe, a cowboy-hat-wearing local sheriff who had publicly praised border militias and regularly discussed immigration on Fox News. Coe shared intel with him and discussed the idea of Eubanks \u201crunning a bush team to track the cartel,\u201d Eubanks told Seddon and others. Eubanks complained in the chats that the Texas Department of Public Safety was \u201crefusing to work with us\u201d but said AP3 was collaborating with the Border Patrol and the National Guard, who installed \u201cobservation pads for us to use along the river.\u201d\n\nThe partnerships didn\u2019t always go smoothly. Once, an AP3 member got into an argument with a National Guardsman that turned physical. \u201cHe kicked the shit out of the national guardsman,\u201d Ross, who helped coordinate the operation, told ProPublica. \u201cI called him and said, \u2018You cannot beat up the national guardsmen any more.\u2019\u201d (Local law enforcement arrived but decided not to make any arrests, according to Ross.)\n\nCoe did not respond to requests for comment. A Border Patrol spokesperson did not address ProPublica\u2019s questions about its agents but said that civilians \u201cinvolving themselves in border security related activities\u201d is \u201cunlawful\u201d and \u201cdangerous.\u201d In response to detailed questions, the Texas Military Department, which oversees the Texas National Guard, issued a one-sentence statement: \u201cThe Texas Military Department does not provide support to or operate with local militias.\u201d\n\nAs the operation expanded, Eubanks sent back pictures of hundreds of migrants the militias had \u201crounded up,\u201d huddled on the ground, often surrounded by Border Patrol or what appear to be National Guard members. The militiamen would return excited after stopping a group at gunpoint, according to Lorraine Mercer, the charity\u2019s ministry director, who got to know the men over many months as their host. They didn\u2019t always wait for government agents to arrive, Mercer said. \u201cSome of them were trying to run them back into Mexico,\u201d she told ProPublica. They\u2019d say, \u201cWe\u2019ll handle them, the Border Patrol doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nSeddon wanted the operation to get even more ambitious. And he had a scheme he thought could make that possible. \u201cThe bottom line is we need to start making money,\u201d he told state leaders in July 2022. His answer was to create a nonprofit called American Community Outreach Network.\n\nACON\u2019s website gave no indication of its ties to AP3. It was advertised as a charity that provided services in disaster zones and to disadvantaged youth.\n\nBut in internal chats, Seddon was explicit that ACON was a way to fund the militia. \u201cI want every single one of us to fucking get rich,\u201d he said in one video. \u201cI want to be sitting on a yacht in two years with every one of you,\u201d he said in another. Members would receive a 20% cut of any donations they brought in, he promised.\n\nThis was more than a get-rich-quick ploy, in Seddon\u2019s telling. It could help AP3 thrive in the post-Jan. 6 era. \u201cI feel reborn,\u201d he said as the plan moved ahead. Imagine if people didn\u2019t need to juggle militia duties with their day jobs, \u201cif every single one of us had the ability to do this full-time,\u201d he said. It\u2019d be so much easier to mobilize troops to the border or anywhere else.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Going to Be a Blood Bath\u201d\n\n\u201cThis election is do or die for us,\u201d Seddon told his lieutenants in August 2022. The midterm elections were months away, and Democrats controlled the White House and both chambers of Congress. If we can\u2019t retake Congress now, Seddon said in a video, \u201cwe\u2019re in real, real deep shit.\u201d He had a plan to get involved.\n\nSeddon wanted AP3 to fan out across the country, stake out ballot boxes and deter fraudulent voting, which he claimed was rampant during the 2020 election. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to persuade these people maybe that\u2019s not such a good idea,\u201d Seddon said about supposed liberal ballot stuffers. \u201cThere\u2019s a large group of what look like some pretty badass patriots outside.\u201d The operation was shortly underway in Arizona, Colorado and Michigan, though it\u2019s unclear how many members heeded Seddon\u2019s call.\n\nAbsentee ballots had barely made it into voters\u2019 mailboxes before it all went awry. Eubanks posted a handheld video of a television screen in an internal chat: \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d was showing surveillance footage of a man in Maricopa County, Arizona. The man hadn\u2019t been identified, but inside AP3, they knew who he was: a Marine veteran named Elias Humiston. Several years before, he had pleaded guilty to an illegal firearm discharge. Now he was at the center of a national news cycle.\n\nHumiston was captured on camera outside a drop box for absentee ballots. His face was masked, and he had a handgun and wore a tactical vest. He had gotten into a confrontation with a woman who tried to record his license plate, prompting the sheriff\u2019s department to arrive.\n\n\u201cNow the DOJ is involved,\u201d Eubanks wrote four days after the incident. Government attorneys said such activities could constitute illegal voter intimidation. But the authorities didn\u2019t appear to know that the anonymous vigilante was a part of AP3.\n\nHumiston had held a leadership role in AP3 and had recently won an award from the militia for his work at the border. He promptly resigned \u201cto protect\u201d AP3, records show. He was never charged with a crime or publicly linked to the militia. (Humiston did not respond to requests for comment.)\n\nSome leaders said that Humiston\u2019s efforts \u201cshould be applauded.\u201d Another camp saw the mission as a foolhardy mistake by Seddon. \u201cPoorly planned and horribly executed,\u201d one leader called it.\n\nSeddon told everyone to stop acting like cowards. \u201cIf it\u2019s not this, it\u2019s the fact that we\u2019re white, that we\u2019re Christian,\u201d he said. The DOJ is \u201cgoing to come at us no matter what we do,\u201d Seddon continued. \u201cCommunism \u2014 that\u2019s where this country is leading if we don\u2019t take a stand.\u201d\n\nSeddon had always had a short fuse. But he was becoming increasingly militant and inflammatory, according to several longtime members. In messages, he raged against \u201cpedophilia\u201d in schools and the \u201cpanels of blacks\u201d \u201cdisrespecting white Americans\u201d on MSNBC. When Congress increased the IRS\u2019 budget, he declared that revenue agents were coming to \u201ckill our kids.\u201d Once, in a voice note he recorded while driving, he paused. \u201cI almost ran over this nigger,\u201d Seddon said. \u201cI am not racist \u2014 just these dirty fucks walking these streets.\u201d\n\nSeven former leaders told ProPublica they became alarmed by how the rhetoric was shifting in AP3. In the days after Jan. 6, Seddon had suppressed calls for violence, telling members who wanted to assassinate politicians to stand down. But he had stopped acting as a voice of restraint, even as such talk increased.\n\nOne morning in August 2022, an ex-cop with at least 100 AP3 members under his command announced a mysterious initiative. He had previously said it was time to take a violent stand against Black Lives Matter: \u201cWe will have to suffer some and some will die,\u201d he said, but he was \u201ctired of waiting.\u201d Now he said he planned to assemble a \u201cTac Team\u201d of \u201cthose who will do what others won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nA different afternoon, a different leader put forward his own proposal. \u201cWe havnt made any head way in the last 5 plus years,\u201d he wrote. Let\u2019s pick a date and descend on government buildings across the country, he suggested, and then kill the officials who\u2019ve committed treason. \u201cTime to stack body\u2019s up.\u201d (Two others told him to arrange a secret meeting offline.)\n\nAfter the 2022 midterms, Ross made a plea in an internal chat. \u201cAPIII AND EVERY OTHER PATRIOT group seems to want a fight,\u201d he wrote. \u201cA war will leave no winners.\u201d Ross, too, believed that civil war was inevitable, but he pushed for the group to focus on grassroots politics in the meantime. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a time to be violent,\u201d he told ProPublica. \u201cI\u2019m the type of person who\u2019s like, \u2018Now is not the time.\u2019\u201d In AP3, that made him a moderate.\n\nA growing faction had lost hope in the democratic process. Elections and activism are pointless, they maintained; even the midterms were rife with fraud. They felt out of alternatives. Their talk was now a steady drumbeat:\n\n\u201cGet it over with I\u2019ll die with honor.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a blood bath.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen does AP3 as a whole say, that\u2019s enough and stand up?\u201d\n\nFirst two images: AP3 members training in the light and in the dark. Third image: AP3 members with fellow militiamen from the Oath Keepers. Credit: Obtained by ProPublica\n\n\u201cI Know Where You Live\u201d\n\nSeddon\u2019s downfall started around the turn of this year. An AP3 member, increasingly suspicious, had obtained a copy of his military discharge papers. That was enough to cause an explosion. After years of touting his Army experience, Seddon\u2019s secret was exposed.\n\nHe tried to suppress the uprising that ensued. He threatened a former leader who confronted him about the records in private. \u201cI know where you live,\u201d Seddon wrote on Facebook Messenger. \u201cTread careful.\u201d Ross accused Seddon of stolen valor and was kicked out.\n\nSeddon\u2019s command quickly began to unravel. A rumor started to spread: Law enforcement was investigating the ACON scheme. The charity had never taken off. One of Seddon\u2019s ex-deputies told ProPublica it raised less than $5,000. But its website falsely advertised it as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit authorized to accept tax-deductible donations, which the IRS said is not true.\n\nLeaders who had spent months encouraging the initiative now condemned ACON as a scam to put money in Seddon\u2019s pocket. \u201cNot volunteering for a Rico trial,\u201d one member wrote in a side chat, referring to the racketeering statute that prosecutors use to take down the mafia. In the spring, state chapters began to defect from AP3 in droves.\n\nSoon Seddon had lost a significant majority of his organization. Former leaders estimate that about 10 state chapters stayed on, leaving him to try to rebuild the militia\u2019s presence everywhere else.\n\nSeddon appears undaunted. He\u2019s lost a large chunk of his membership before and managed to recover. (Meanwhile, the instability in his career continues. Recently, he started a business that offers \u201cfast cash\u201d to cancer patients who sign over their life insurance policies.)\n\nSeddon, left, at a 2024 training Credit: via Gab\n\nHis recent setbacks seem to have only made him more volatile. Toward the end of Trump\u2019s criminal trial in May, Seddon wrote on Facebook that Judge Juan Merchan was treating the former president unfairly. \u201cThis guy needs to meet his maker,\u201d Seddon said. He followed up by posting the judge\u2019s home address.\n\nFacebook shut down his account, which he\u2019d long been using to promote the militia. The platform conducted a large enforcement action against AP3 in June, according to the Meta spokesperson, removing 40 pages, 15 groups and 600 accounts that \u201cwere mostly focusing on recruitment.\u201d The spokesperson said Facebook strengthened its policies at the beginning of the year \u201cto take an even stricter approach to enforcement against this group and other banned militia organizations.\u201d\n\nSeddon was back on social media, this time on TikTok, after the assassination attempt on Trump in July. \u201cThis was a direct attack on us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to become fucking lions.\u201d\n\nAP3\u2019s travails have not been unique. Since the Capitol riot, the militia movement has grown more fractured and decentralized. This may make it harder for one leader to spur mass action. It could also make it harder for one leader to prevent mass action and for law enforcement to track the groups and to intervene.\n\nProPublica Read More The Gospel of Matthew Trewhella: How a Militant Anti-Abortion Activist Is Influencing Republican Politics\n\nThe presidential election could propel the militia movement in a darker direction. Experts worry that a Trump loss could spark violence from those who feel it\u2019s their only option, especially if he once again refuses to accept the results. If Trump wins and then fulfills his promise to pardon Jan. 6 defendants, they fear the most radical wing of his party could take it as a license for more extreme action.\n\nAP3 may have splintered, but its former members have mostly just moved to other militias. John Valle, Seddon\u2019s former third in command, sees the movement\u2019s future as consisting of state and local groups, operating independently but coordinating on secure messaging apps.\n\nHe said that the 286 members of his Washington chapter are now operating as their own independent group. They didn\u2019t want to get caught up in AP3\u2019s potential legal problems, but their mission remains the same. As Valle put it, \u201cWe\u2019re just rebranding.\u201d",

        "text": "Election 2024: The Democratic National Convention Begins on Monday\nDemocrats are in an upbeat mood as their national convention opens in Chicago on Monday. An election that seemed to be getting away from them just a month ago now seems winnable. The trend is the Democrats\u2019 friend at the moment.\n\nLike the Republican convention in Milwaukee last month, the Democrats\u2019 four-day gathering will be a highly scripted affair. But there will be at least one important difference. Former President George W. Bush, former vice presidents Dick Cheney, Mike Pence, and Dan Quayle, and former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney all skipped the Republican National Convention. The Democratic convention, in contrast, will showcase the party\u2019s past standard bearers.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton are set to speak Monday night. Expect the president to get a roaring ovation from the delegates. After all, they were initially selected to support his candidacy. Former President Barack Obama will speak Tuesday night in his hometown. Former President Bill Clinton will speak Wednesday night before vice presidential nominee Tim Walz speaks. Kamala Harris will accept the nomination, which was formally awarded earlier this month in a virtual vote, on Thursday night.\n\nThe Water's Edge James M.

The two candidates will campaign with their spouses, marking the first time the four have campaigned as a group. The tour will begin in Pittsburgh on Sunday and make multiple stops in western Pennsylvania. That\u2019s hardly by accident. The Keystone State is a must-win for the Harris-Walz ticket. And the bus tour won\u2019t head straight for the Windy City. Harris and Walz plan to hold a rally at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee on Tuesday. That\u2019s where the Republicans met last month. Wisconsin also happens to be a must-win state for the Democrats.\n\nThe stakes are high for Harris in Chicago. Most Americans know little about her. Donald Trump and JD Vance are busily trying to paint her as \u201cFailed. Weak. Dangerously liberal.\u201d Her Thursday night speech is her opportunity to define her own narrative and to present her vision for the country. She won\u2019t have another unchallenged opportunity to define herself at any other point during the campaign.\n\nDemocrats are hoping that Harris will rise to the occasion. If so, Chicago could propel her to victory much as it helped secure Clinton\u2019s reelection victory in 1996. But any Democratic gathering in Chicago brings back memories of the party\u2019s disastrous 1968 convention. Then, violent protests over the Vietnam War dominated the news coverage and likely cost Hubert Humphrey the presidency. It was cold comfort for Democrats that a national commission later blamed the violence on a \u201cpolice riot\u201d rather than on anti-war protestors.\n\nChicago expects thousands of protestors next week, with many of them demonstrating against U.S. support for Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. Those crowds won\u2019t match the number of protestors that Chicago saw fifty-six years ago even if they feel as passionately about their cause. Democratic officials seem more concerned about protests inside the convention hall. Thirty of the nearly 4,000 Democrats at the United Center next week are uncommitted. Most of them won their seats because of voters who opposed Biden\u2019s support for Israel\u2019s war.\n\nWhile the number of uncommitted delegates is small, a well-timed protest or viral moment could hurt the image of unity and confidence that Democrats want to project. For that reason, Democratic Party officials have been negotiating with leaders of the Uncommitted National Movement over whether critics of U.S. policy toward Gaza will be allowed to address the convention. Those discussions have yet to yield a resolution.\n\nIf the Democrats can navigate this and other challenges that emerge over the next week, they might extend the impressive string of success Harris has enjoyed since Biden stepped aside. But as Republicans learned just last month, events can quickly derail a friendly trend.\n\nCampaign Update\n\nTim Walz on Wednesday accepted an invitation from CBS News to debate JD Vance in New York City on Tuesday, October 1. Vance told Fox News on Wednesday night that \u201cI strongly suspect we\u2019re gonna be there on October 1\u201d and said \u201cwe should do more than one debate.\u201d He then hedged by saying \u201cwe\u2019re not gonna run, walk into a fake news media garbage debate.\u201d By yesterday morning, the hedging was gone. Vance not only accepted the CBS invitation, he announced that he had accepted an invitation from CNN to debate Walz on September 18. The Harris campaign responded with a statement that appeared to reject the call for a second vice-presidential debate while insisting on the need for a second presidential debate. Vance\u2019s reacted by tweeting: \u201cTim Walz refuses to deploy!\u201d\n\nPolitico reported on Saturday that someone named \u201cRobert\u201d began sending them internal communications from a senior Trump campaign official along with a copy of a lengthy report the campaign had compiled on JD Vance\u2019s potential political vulnerabilities. Other news outlets quickly acknowledged that they had received a similar offer. The Trump campaign confirmed the hack, which it attributed to \u201cforeign sources hostile to the United States.\u201d Trump personally blamed Iran, saying that it was likely because \u201cI was strong on Iran and I was protecting people in the Middle East that maybe they aren\u2019t so happy about that.\u201d The FBI is now investigating the hack, which began by gaining access to the email account of Trump confidante Roger Stone. Google said on Wednesday that a group tied to Iran has been trying to hack the Biden and Trump campaigns since May. Unlike in 2016, when the Hillary Clinton campaign\u2019s hacked emails were given to Wikileaks and then published by news outlets, none of the news outlets that have received the hacked emails have published them.\n\nTrump returned to X for the first time in almost a year on Monday. He posted a campaign video portraying himself as the victim of politicized criminal prosecutions and touted his interview that night with Elon Musk. Other than posting a spoof video of him and Musk dancing to the turn of \u201cStayin\u2019 Alive\u201d and the audio of his conversation with Musk, Trump has limited his social media posts to his Truth Social account.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers yesterday asked Judge Juan Merchan to postpone the sentencing of the former president on his thirty-four felony convictions for falsifying business records. Sentencing is currently set for September 18. The lawyers argued that by adjourning sentencing until after Election Day, \"which is of paramount importance to the entire Nation, the Court would reduce, even if not eliminate, issues regarding the integrity of any future proceedings.\" Merchan has not announced when he will rule on the request.\n\nArizona and Missouri this week became the latest states to add a referendum on abortion rights to their ballots in November. Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Nevada, and South Dakota already have similar ballot initiatives scheduled. Democrats applauded the news, believing it will help the Harris-Walz ticket and Democratic congressional candidates by increasing the turnout of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters. In the two years since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, abortion-rights referenda have passed every time they have been on the ballot, including in red states like Kansas and Ohio.\n\nWhat the Candidates Are Saying\n\nThe potential for artificial intelligence (AI) to sow disinformation in the 2024 campaign has gained a lot of attention. What has gained far less attention is that false claims about AI-generated material can also be used to discredit accurate information. Trump highlighted that danger on Sunday when he posted on Truth Social that the Harris campaign had used AI to generate fake crowds in photos of a campaign stop.\n\nSimilar posts were widely shared on X, Facebook, and Instagram as well. The problem is that the claims were false. The photos weren\u2019t doctored, by AI, Photoshop, or any other technology. Trump, however, didn\u2019t retract his charge or take down his post.\n\nMuch like Ron DeSantis\u2019s ill-fated campaign launch on X last year, Trump\u2019s interview with Musk got off to a rocky start. Technical problems delayed the start of their conversation for forty minutes.\n\nWhen the conversation did get underway, it consisted mostly of Musk asking Trump softball questions. Musk made clear that was his intent, saying he had no intention of being \u201cadversarial\u201d and instead wanted \u201cto just get a feel for what Donald Trump is just like in a conversation. Policy issues largely got the short shrift in the conversation. Musk did ask Trump about climate change. He dismissed it as a concern, saying that \u201coceans are gonna rise one eighth-of-an-inch over the next four hundred years\u201d and that will mean \u201cyou will have more oceanfront property.\u201d (That first claim is flat wrong; the second could well be true, but not in a good way.) Many listeners noted that Trump seemed to lisp and slur his words during the interview. Trump later acknowledged the problem, blaming it on modern technology.\n\nTrump gave what was billed as a major speech on the economy Wednesday in Asheville, North Carolina. However, the former president didn\u2019t seem to have much enthusiasm for the assignment. Early on, he seemed to mock his task, calling it \u201can intellectual speech\u201d and the audience members \u201care all intellectuals today.\u201d He then veered off course to complain that the United States \u201chas become a third-world nation\u201d and \u201ca banana republic\u201d that is \u201cstarting a freefall.\u201d He also launched into his standard personal attacks, saying that Harris is \u201cnot smart. She\u2019s not intelligent.\u201d\n\nWhen Trump did address economic issues, he promised that the economy would grow so rapidly under his leadership that \u201cwe will pay off all our debt.\u201d He made a similar promise in 2016. Instead, the national debt grew by nearly $8 trillion during his presidency. He also pledged to cut income taxes and end taxes on Social Security and tips, all of which would drive up the annual federal deficit and the national debt. He also pledged to lower energy costs by \u201c50 to 70 percent\u201d within a year or at a \u201cmaximum 18 months.\u201d\n\nYesterday, Trump held his second press conference in a week. As with Wednesday\u2019s speech, the idea was that the former president would hit the Harris-Waltz ticket on economic issues. He stuck to his script for a while before, as Politico put it, he \u201conce again veered off topic, weighing in on windmills killing birds, repeatedly falsely claiming Harris is a communist, pontificating on the weight of electric trucks and bragging about the audience size of his glitchy conversation on X with tech mogul Elon Musk.\u201d He also continued to insult Harris, saying: \u201cI think I\u2019m entitled to personal attacks. I don\u2019t have a lot of respect for her.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the day at an event on combatting antisemitism, Trump noted that he had given the Presidential Medal of Freedom to the woman who introduced him, Miriam Adelson, one of his most generous campaign donors. Trump went on to say that the Medal of Freedom is \u201cthe equivalent of the Congressional (sic) Medal of Honor, but civilian version. It\u2019s actually much better because everyone [who] gets the Congressional Medal of Honor, they're soldiers. They\u2019re either in very bad shape because they\u2019ve been hit so many times by bullets or they\u2019re dead.\u201d Trump\u2019s comments sparked sharp criticism and resurfaced his previous remarks denigrating Americans who have made the ultimate sacrifice for their country.\n\nWhat the Pundits Are Saying\n\nBloomberg\u2019s David Marchick wrote that Trump\u2019s election in November would likely usher in a chaotic transition. Each incoming administration has eleven weeks to make a dent in selecting its cabinet and filling some 4,000 senior government positions. Making that go smoothly requires advance planning. However, \u201cTrump has not appointed a transition director or team to prepare for his presidency should he be elected again, nor has he publicly communicated his plans to do so. By this time four years ago, the Biden-Harris ticket had not only appointed transition leaders but had several hundred people working full time on planning.\u201d\n\nPaul Musgrave argued in Foreign Policy that Walz has held a consistent view of China ever since he taught English there in the late 1980s. According to Musgrave, Walz is \u201ca measured critic of the Chinese Communist Party\u2014prone neither to exaggeration nor accommodation. Nor is this a pose cooked up by spin doctors in the past few weeks. Small-town Nebraska newspaper articles\u2014published well before Walz had any political ambitions\u2014demonstrate that his professed affection for the Chinese people and culture has been matched by a longstanding criticism of the country\u2019s rulers.\u201d\n\nJoe Cirincione wrote in Defense One that Trump\u2019s call for building an Iron Dome over the United States is nonsensical. Cirincione noted that the United States has spent $415 billion over the past four decades on defenses against long-range missiles and succeeded in building a system that works roughly half the time against limited attacks under ideal conditions. The prospects of building a system that works against large-scale attacks are nil. If Trump has in mind replicating Israel\u2019s Iron Dome system, it \u201cis designed to intercept relatively primitive rockets and mortars that travel under 44 miles. That is fine if you want to defend San Diego from rockets launched from Tijuana, some 35 miles away. But the system couldn\u2019t even protect Mar-a-Lago from missiles fired from the Bahamas, some 80 miles away.\u201d Perhaps even more important, neither Canada nor Mexico is deploying short-range missiles to threaten the United States.\n\nWhat the Polls Show\n\nThe latest Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research assessed how Americans compared Harris and Trump on several leadership qualities. Harris fared better than Trump on which candidate was \u201ccommitted to democracy\u201d and \u201cdisciplined\u201d\u2014nearly half of respondents said those qualities better describe Harris, while three in ten said they better describe Trump. Four in ten respondents said that \u201chonest\u201d better describes Harris, while one in four said the term better describes Trump.

        "text": "August 18, 2024, presidential campaign news\nPresident Joe Biden and Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris arrive to speak at Prince George's Community College in Largo, Maryland on August 15. Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Democratic torch is set to be passed Monday night in Chicago, where Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to make her first appearance on the opening night of the Democratic National Convention after President Joe Biden delivers his marquee speech to the party faithful.\n\nAs Democrats put the finishing touches on a far different convention than imagined only a month ago, several people familiar with the planning tell CNN that Harris is poised to appear alongside Biden before the party begins to look forward toward the November election.\n\nThe whirlwind change to the Democratic ticket \u2013 with Harris replacing Biden as the party\u2019s nominee \u2013 is giving way to something of a slow motion series of appreciations for Biden. Their joint appearance on Thursday in Maryland, where Biden arrived to a hero\u2019s welcome, was seen as the prelude to the big finale on Monday.\n\nThe moment will amount to the end of a long political arc for Biden, who attended his first Democratic National Convention as a 29-year-old candidate for Senate in 1972. At the time, he was running to be the country\u2019s youngest senator. He\u2019ll walk onstage Monday as it\u2019s oldest sitting president.\n\nWhile there were early discussions around whether Biden would attend Harris\u2019 acceptance speech on Thursday, they did not advance. He is not expected to remain in Chicago past Monday, as the convention turns toward officially elevating Harris as the Democratic standard bearer.\n\nBiden has watched with genuine pride as the party coalesces around Harris, people familiar with his thinking say, and he has voiced relief that a prolonged battle for the nomination was avoided after he swiftly endorsed her following his decision to withdraw.\n\nHarris, meanwhile, has taken pains to venerate Biden in public. \u201cI could speak all afternoon about the person that I\u2019m standing on this stage with: our extraordinary president, Joe Biden,\u201d she said Thursday.\n\nBefore she arrives in Chicago, Harris is planning to roll through battleground Pennsylvania on a bus tour. She\u2019ll also hold a rally in nearby Milwaukee on Tuesday.",

UIC's E.J. Fagan and ABC7 Political Analyst Laura Washington previewed the big week ahead.\n\nA new ABC News poll shows Kamala Harris leads Donald Trump overall in the 2024 presidential election. UIC's E.J. Fagan and ABC7 Political Analyst Laura Washington previewed the big week ahead.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris heads into her nominating convention this week leading former President Donald Trump in a head-to-head matchup, bolstered by vast improvements over President Joe Biden in enthusiasm and perceived readiness for the job and sharply better support among key groups including swing-voting independents, according to a new latest ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll.\n\nYet Trump retains the upper hand on the two top-cited election issues in the poll -- the overall economy and inflation -- and also leads on a third -- immigration -- keeping the race a closely contested one.\n\nAmong all adults -- relevant since there's plenty of time to register -- Harris and Gov. Tim Walz lead Trump and Sen. JD Vance by 50%-45%. Among those now registered to vote, it's 49%-45%, a slight Harris advantage given sampling tolerances. And Harris has a 6-point lead among likely voters, 51%-45%.\n\nRoughly echoing these results, this poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates with fieldwork by Ipsos, also finds that more people see Harris as qualified for the job, 53%, than say the same about Trump, 47%.\n\nSee PDF for full results.\n\nA new ABC News poll shows Kamala Harris leads Donald Trump overall in the 2024 presidential election. E.J. Fagan and Laura Washington broke down the latest numbers.\n\nIn a five-way matchup, the poll finds Harris/Walz and Trump/Vance at 47%-44% among the general public and registered voters alike, and 49%-45% among likely voters. None of these is a statistically significant difference, suggesting the Democrats would prefer a two-way race.\n\nThat said, among all adults, support for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (and his running mate Nicole Shanahan) is down to 5%, from a peak of 12% in April. Cornel West/Melina Abdullah have 1%, as does Jill Stein of the Green Party.\n\nThese candidates' ballot access is to be determined; per ABC News estimates, Kennedy currently is on the ballot in 21 states, Stein in 20 and West in eight.\n\nCandidate attributes\n\nUnderlying shifts from July are dramatic, particularly in views of some candidate attributes. There also are sharp increases in Democrats' satisfaction with the presidential matchup and enthusiasm for their candidate.\n\nAmong all adults, Harris leads on two measures on which Biden lagged badly. Americans by a wide 56%-26% pick her over Trump as having the physical health to serve effectively as president, reversing Trump's 31-point lead over Biden on this attribute last month. And Harris leads Trump by 9 percentage points in being seen as having the mental sharpness it takes to serve effectively, erasing a 30-point Trump lead over Biden on this measure.\n\nHarris also leads Trump by 15 points on honesty and trustworthiness and by 6 points in better-representing people's personal values, both roughly matching Biden's position before he left the race. And she leads Trump by 7 points in empathy -- understanding the problems of people like you -- an important gauge on which Biden and Trump were essentially even in July.\n\nThere's another characteristic particular to Harris: Thirty-eight percent of Americans say that having a woman serve as president would be a good thing for the country, far more than the 14% who see it as a bad thing. The rest, 47%, say it makes no difference. (Forty percent of women call a woman president a good thing, as do 35% of men.)\n\nStrength/enthusiasm\n\nIn another sharp change, 60% of Harris' backers support her strongly, matching Trump's strong support and compared with just 34% strong support for Biden last month.\n\nFurther, 50% overall say they'd be enthusiastic or satisfied if Harris were elected, compared with 36% who said that about Biden in early 2023, even before concerns about his cognitive age grew. Just among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, enthusiasm or satisfaction with Harris as their candidate is 19 points higher than Biden's at that time, at 91% versus 72%.\n\nForty-five percent overall say they'd be enthusiastic or satisfied with a Trump victory, about the same as in early 2023 (43%). It's 85% among Republicans and GOP-leaning independents, up 6 points.\n\nTo be sure, fewer than half of Americans, 44%, are satisfied with a Harris-Trump matchup, with 55% dissatisfied. But that's sharply improved from views on a Biden-Trump race, with which just 28% were satisfied, 71% dissatisfied, last month.\n\nIt's also the case that Harris' choice of Walz as her running mate has been better received than Trump's selection of Vance, as reported Friday.\n\nKey issues\n\nAt the same time, Trump leads Harris by 9 points in trust to handle the economy and inflation alike, roughly maintaining his position on these issues against Biden last month. More than 85% of adults rate both of these as highly important in their vote for president, tops among 11 issues tested.\n\nTrump also leads Harris, by 10 points, in trust to handle the immigration situation at the U.S.-Mexico border, versus a 14-point Trump lead in July. But other issues surpass immigration in importance, including health care, on which Harris leads Trump by 7 points; protecting American democracy, Harris +6; and crime and safety, on which they're close.\n\nNotably, the gap on crime and safety has narrowed from a Trump lead, +7 points, in July, to Trump +3 points now, not a significant gap. And Harris leads by 5 points in trust to handle gun violence, compared with a virtual tie for Biden (+1) against Trump in July. Both shifts may reflect Harris' credentials as a former prosecutor.\n\nHarris also leads, by 5 points, in trust to handle appointments to the U.S. Supreme Court. Among items lower on the importance list, she leads Trump by 12 points in trust to handle abortion and 14 points to handle race relations, while he's +5 points on handling the Israel/Hamas war (down from +9 against Biden).\n\nCandidate influence\n\nWhile Trump leads in trust to handle the economy and immigration, most people give Harris at least somewhat of a pass on the Biden administration's policies on both issues. The public by about a 2-1 margin, 64%-33%, thinks Harris had limited influence on Biden's economic policies, and by 57%-39% says the same about her influence on immigration policies.\n\nEconomic views matter, given the issue's importance. With 72% of Americans rating the economy negatively, Trump is sure to seek to pin blame on Harris, and she to try to avoid it. Currently, he leads by 61%-33% among those who rate the economy negatively; she, by 89%-8% among those who rate it positively. Wednesday's new inflation figure, a low since early 2021, may offer help to Harris, but prices and interest rates still have risen sharply on the Biden/Harris watch, and recession fears are afoot.\n\nTrump may face more of a challenge on the abortion issue. Although fewer rate it as highly important, it's also the case that Americans by 56%-39% think Trump had substantial influence in bringing about the U.S. Supreme Court decision eliminating the constitutional right to an abortion -- a decision the public opposes by 62%-35%.\n\nSupporters of the abortion ruling support Trump by 81%-13%, but the majority that opposes it supports Harris, by 72%-25%. Indeed, among people who think Trump had a larger role in bringing about the abortion ruling, Harris leads, 69%-28%. Among those who think Trump had less influence, that flips to a 73%-22% Trump lead.\n\nVote-preference gaps based on views of Harris' influence on economic and immigration policy are far less pronounced, and run in the opposite direction. She does 10 points better with people who think she's had more influence on economic policy, and 9 points better among those who think she had more influence on immigration policy, both compared with those who think she's had less influence.\n\nVote groups\n\nSome of the changes among groups from Biden to Harris are striking. Among them:\n\n\n\nIndependents went from +4 points for Trump in July to +11 Harris now, a 15-point swing. Classic swing voters, independents have gone with the winner in nine of the last 12 presidential elections, all but those in 2012, 2004 and 1976.\n\nPeople younger than age 40 have moved from +2 Biden in July to +20 for Harris now, an 18-point swing.\n\nWomen age 18-29 split about evenly (Trump +2) in July; now they favor Harris by 23 points, a 25-point swing in this group. It's almost as big, an 18-point swing to Harris, among women age 30 to 49. Harris also has improved from Biden's score among men age 18-29, from Biden +1 in July to Harris +14 now, a 13-point swing.\n\nSupport from Black people has swung by 12 points in Harris' direction, from +60 for Biden in July to +72 for Harris now. Her gain is about equal among Black men and Black women alike. (Harris is a Black and South Asian person. The sample size of Asians in this survey is too small for a vote-preference estimate, but a combination of the last two surveys with a Harris-Trump matchup, the first done before Biden withdrew, finds Harris ahead of Trump among Asians by 65%-32%.)\n\nHarris has seen an 8-point swing among Hispanic people. That's occurred mostly among Hispanic women, a 17-point swing from +2 for Trump in July to +15 for Harris now.\n\nIn the middle-income range, people with household incomes from $50,000 to $99,999 have gone from Trump +7 in July to Harris +8 now, a 15-point shift.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nSome potential voters may be persuadable in the campaign ahead. Among people who don't currently support Trump, 12% say they'd consider voting for him. Among those who don't now support Harris, an almost equal number, 11%, say they'd consider her.\n\nThe question is how the candidates attract new supporters while keeping their bases motivated. Appeals on ideological lines seem thin: While 46% see Harris as too liberal, as Trump consistently charges, almost as many, 42%, see him as too conservative.\n\nAnother challenging line is Trump's contention that the Democratic Party encouraged the sentiment that led to an attempt on his life. Instead, more Americans blame the Republican Party for the risk of politically motivated violence in this country, 37%, than blame the Democrats, 26%; an additional 25% blame both equally.\n\nBest for Trump is his advantage on the economy and Harris' association with Biden, who labors under a 37%-55% job approval rating, essentially steady the past 15 months. Indeed, Harris' own rating for handling her job as vice president is just 39%-49%. But Trump's retrospective rating also is underwater, 44%-49%. And at this stage, at least, Harris possesses one potentially crucial election commodity: momentum.\n\nMethodology\n\nThis ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll was conducted online via the probability-based Ipsos KnowledgePanel Aug. 9-13, 2024, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 2,336 adults. Partisan divisions are 29%-29%-29%, Democrats-Republicans-independents. Results have a margin of sampling error of 2 percentage points, including the design effect, for the full sample. Sampling error is not the only source of differences in polls.\n\nThe survey was produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates, with sampling and data collection by Ipsos.

However, before Joe Biden withdrew his candidacy from the US presidential election in November, Trump led hum by 3% in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\nAlso Read | Trump loses third bid for judge to step aside in hush money case\n\nIt is pertinent to note that Trump and Harris need to secure at least one of the four Sun Belt States alongside three Rust Belt states to clinch the US presidential post. Currently, both candidates are tied at 48%, as per the survey report.\n\nSaturday's poll data shows significant improvement for Democrats, as the previous survey conducted in May stated that Trump was leading Biden in three states: Arizona, Georgia and Nevada.\n\nAlso Read | Kamala Harris\u2019s economic team and agenda start to take shape\n\n\u2018Kamala Harris easier than Joe Biden\u2019 On Saturday, Donald Trump said he believed Democrat Kamala Harris would be easier to beat than Biden, even as some polls showed her edging ahead in the November 5 presidential election race.\n\n\"I believe she will be easier to beat than him,\" said Trump, referring to her as \"radical\" and a \u201clunatic\u201d. His remarks came during a rally in Wilkes-Barre in northeastern Pennsylvania, a state looming large in the campaign.\n\nAlso Read | US Presidential polls: Trump picks Tulsi Gabbard for debate with Kamala Harris\n\n\u201cHave you heard her laugh?

        "text": "After years of doubt, Kamala Harris becomes Democrats' leader\nLong-doubted by Democrats, Kamala Harris faces her biggest political moment\n\nBBC\n\nWhen Kamala Harris steps onto the stage at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago this week as the party\u2019s presidential nominee, she\u2019ll do so knowing that many in the audience cheering her on once counted her out. Ms Harris, 59, has faced years of doubt from some within her party about her ability to run for America\u2019s highest political office - including from President Joe Biden, the man whom she continues to serve as vice-president. Since replacing Mr Biden as Democratic nominee in mid-July, Ms Harris has seen a tidal wave of enthusiasm for her candidacy - reflected in polling, fundraising and the enormous crowds that have come out to see her at rallies across the country. But the political momentum and energy she has generated in recent weeks among Democrats was never a given. After failing in a short-lived presidential bid in 2019, she began her vice-presidency on a shaky footing, beset by stumbles in high-profile interviews, staff turnover and low approval ratings. And for the last three-and-a-half years in the White House she has struggled to break through to American voters. Advisers and allies say that in the years since those early struggles she has sharpened her political skills, created loyal coalitions within her party and built credibility on issues like abortion rights that energise the Democratic base. She has, in other words, been preparing for a moment exactly like this one. On Thursday, as she formally accepts the Democratic nomination, Ms Harris has an opportunity to reintroduce herself on the national stage with fewer than 80 days until an election that could see her become the nation\u2019s first female president. At the same time, she\u2019ll have to prove that she is capable of leading a party that never saw her as its natural leader and remains divided over the war in Israel and Gaza. But above all, she\u2019ll need put to rest any lingering doubt among the Democratic faithful that she can meet the challenge of defeating former president Donald Trump in what remains a tight and unpredictable contest.\n\nPath to the White House\n\nBefore Kamala Harris became a national figure, the former San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general had forged a reputation as a rising star in the party, landing the endorsement of President Barack Obama in her 2010 race to become the state\u2019s top lawyer. But those who followed her career closely saw a mixed record. As a prosecutor, she faced public outcry for refusing to seek the death penalty for a man convicted of killing a young police officer. And then as attorney-general, she upheld the state\u2019s death penalty despite her personal opposition. Having reached the peaks of California state politics, she was elected to the US Senate the same night that Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. In her brief tenure, she made headlines for her searing and direct questioning of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his testy 2018 confirmation hearings. \u201cCan you think of any laws that give government the power to make decisions about the male body?\u201d she asked the Trump appointee, in an exchange that cascaded across social media and late night television. Like Mr Obama, she was a young senator of limitless ambition. Halfway through her first term, she launched a presidential campaign. That campaign, like this one, was met with great fanfare. More than 20,000 people gathered in her hometown of Oakland, California, for its launch. But her effort to become the Democratic nominee sputtered and collapsed before the first presidential primary ballot was even cast. Ms Harris failed to carve out a clear political identity and distinguish herself in a field of rivals that included Mr Biden and left-wing senator Bernie Sanders. Critics said she endorsed a range of progressive policies but seemed to lack clear conviction. A breakthrough June 2019 debate moment in which she challenged her then-opponent Mr Biden\u2019s record on the racial desegregation of schools resulted in a brief surge in polling. She attacked Mr Biden for an earlier campaign moment in which he fondly recalled working with two segregationist senators, before accusing him of opposing the bussing of students between schools to help integrate them. \u201cThere was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bussed to school every day,\u201d Ms Harris said. \u201cAnd that little girl was me.\u201d\n\nBut campaign infighting and indecision on which issues to emphasise ultimately sank her presidential bid. The campaign was marked by \u201ca lot of rookie mistakes\u201d, said Kevin Madden, an adviser on Republican Mitt Romney\u2019s 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns. \u201cThe substance that needed to be there to pass the commander-in-chief test and to really fill in some of the blanks for voters, it just wasn\u2019t there and as a result her opponents filled it in for her.\u201d Eight months later, Mr Biden put aside their primary rivalry and announced Ms Harris as his running mate. She became the first woman of colour to ever be nominated in that position - and in January 2021, the first female vice-president in US history.\n\nA rocky start\n\nIt was five months into her job as Mr Biden\u2019s vice-president that Ms Harris endured her first public stumble during a foreign trip to Guatemala and Mexico. The trip was meant to showcase her role in pursuing economic initiatives to curb the flow of migrants from Central America to the US southern border, a foreign policy assignment given to her by Mr Biden. But it was quickly overshadowed by an awkward exchange in an interview with NBC News\u2019 Lester Holt, in which she dismissed repeated questions about why she had not yet visited the US-Mexico border.\n\nLater that day, during a press conference with Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei, Ms Harris tried to recapture the narrative, delivering a stark message to migrants thinking of making their way to the US. \u201cDo not come,\u201d she told them. \u201cDo not come.\u201d While the NBC News interview fuelled Republican attacks that continue to this day, the latter comments drew the ire of progressives and were quickly panned on social media, even though other administration officials had echoed the same rhetoric.\n\nThe vice-president\u2019s allies blamed the White House for failing to adequately prepare her and assigning an unwinnable issue. They complained that as the first woman, African-American and Asian-American to serve as vice-president, outsized expectations had been imposed on her from the very start of her term, giving her little time to settle. \u201cThere was immense pressure in the beginning to own things,\u201d said one former aide who was granted anonymity to speak candidly about their time in the White House. In the months that followed, Ms Harris endured more scrutiny as she faced high staff turnover, a slew of negative headlines about her performance and underwhelming media appearances. Hemmed in by Covid restrictions, she was limited in her public engagements, fuelling the perception that she was invisible. When critics labelled her a prop for standing behind Mr Biden at bill-signing ceremonies \u2013 as her white male predecessors in the role regularly did \u2013 a decision was made to remove her from those events altogether, according to aides, triggering more criticism that she was absent. \u201cPeople had an expectation to experience her as vice-president as if she was Michelle Obama, but she was in a job\u2026 built for Al Gore or Mike Pence,\u201d said Jamal Simmons, a longtime Democratic strategist who was brought in as her communications director during the second year.\n\nRoe v Wade and coalition politics\n\nAs her team sought to improve her poor public image, Ms Harris stepped into a bigger foreign policy role. She travelled to Poland in the wake of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, held bilateral meetings in Asia amid heightened tensions with China and stood in for Mr Biden at the Munich Security Conference that same year. But in May 2022, a political earthquake would reshape the trajectory of her vice-presidency. In a rare breach of the Supreme Court, a leaked draft opinion revealed plans to overturn the landmark Roe v Wade abortion ruling - which had protected American women\u2019s federal right to abortion for nearly half a century. She seized on the opportunity to be the lead messenger on an issue that Mr Biden \u2013 a devout Irish Catholic who avoided even saying the term \u201cabortion\u201d \u2013 was reluctant to own. \u201cHow dare they? How dare they tell a woman what she can and cannot do with her own body?\u201d she told the crowd at an event for a pro-choice group on the same day the bombshell leak was published, deciding to attack the nation\u2019s top judges before their decision was officially released. The issue proved to be a driving force for voters in the midterm elections a few months later, helping Democrats to perform better than expected in congressional races and to hold the Senate.\n\nIn seeking to become the administration\u2019s leading voice on abortion, Ms Harris tackled the issue with \u201cclarity of purpose\u201d, said former longtime adviser Rachel Palermo. She convened state legislators, faith leaders, constitutional law experts, healthcare providers and advocates for roundtable discussions. It was a move panned by some activists as not meeting the seriousness of the moment but it was part of a strategy of coalition-building across local and state politics that also helped lay the groundwork for any future presidential run. Ms Harris, who spent most of her career navigating California\u2019s tricky mix of liberal and traditional Democratic politics, knew every event mattered. Every meeting, photo opportunity or dinner - whether it was with black business leaders or Hispanic female CEOs \u2013 was tracked by her team in detailed spreadsheets that she could utilise when the time came to call on a deep political network for support. \u201cShe forced the operation to mobilise around how she views politics, which is coalitions,\u201d a senior official said. Ms Harris always had her eye on a 2028 bid for the White House, as Joe Biden\u2019s natural successor, assuming he won a second term in the 2024 contest. Yet as rumblings mounted about replacing Mr Biden on the ticket after his stumbling debate performance in late June against Donald Trump, some Democrats openly overlooked her. Kamala Harris's positions on 10 key issues\n\nThe 'blended' family behind Kamala Harris\n\nThey, and many pundits, suggested popular governors like California\u2019s Gavin Newsom, Pennsylvania\u2019s Josh Shapiro or Michigan\u2019s Gretchen Whitmer as better replacements who could motivate voters and take the fight to Trump. On 21 July, Mr Biden phoned Ms Harris to tell her of his plans to drop out of the race and endorse her as his successor. It was a decision that took many of his closest allies by surprise, but she sprang into action. Over the course of 10 hours that Sunday, she called more than 100 party officials, members of Congress, labour leaders and activists. Within days, any potential rivals, including the powerful governors, had fallen into line and it was clear that she would take the Democratic mantle with no serious challenge.\n\nAs a candidate, the vice-president has yet to lay out a detailed policy agenda or sit down for a tough media interview. She released an economic blueprint on Friday, calling for tax cuts for families and a wider push on capping drug pricing, her most detailed vision for the country so far. Even as Republicans accuse her of avoiding scrutiny, the team around her see no rush in cutting off the momentum she\u2019s built over the last month. Political strategists say the campaign is right to capitalise on the \u201csugar high\u201d. \u201cWhat Kamala Harris is experiencing is a massive, pent-up demand for people to vote for anybody not named Biden or Trump,\u201d said Mr Madden, the former Romney aide and Republican communications strategist. \u201cBut the test always comes with being exposed to interviews, the press, debates and the harsh glare of a campaign.\u201d Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian who helped organise a meeting of historians at Ms Harris\u2019s official residence last year, said the fact that she has been a blank slate for voters is more of a benefit than a burden. \u201cShe may not have been able to be in full bloom under Biden but she never crossed wires with him,\u201d he said. \u201cSo she was able to be positioned for this moment and she can take what\u2019s good about the Biden years and shed the baggage of what she wants to, or slightly disagrees with.\u201d Though her entrance has jolted an outpouring of support among Democrats, it\u2019s unclear whether she can translate that into broad appeal. While Ms Harris has made some inroads with key demographic groups that had drifted from Mr Biden \u2013 black, Latino and young voters in particular \u2013 she lags in other constituencies that made up his winning 2020 coalition. Recent polling puts her ahead or tied with Trump in six of the seven battleground states, according to a Cook Political Report survey released on Wednesday. In May, when Mr Biden was still the Democratic candidate, Trump was ahead or tied in all seven states.\n\nAnthony Zurcher analyses how Republicans are going after Harris - and how she's fighting back\n\n\u2018I was born with a seatbelt\u2019\n\nThursday night\u2019s speech at the Democratic convention is the most consequential moment in Kamala Harris\u2019s political career. While the Republican convention served as a coronation for Trump, who was nominated as his party\u2019s candidate for the third consecutive time, Ms Harris\u2019s sudden rise means her speech will be seen as a pivotal moment to define who she really is. While she\u2019s stood on the stage before, a senior aide said the speech will have a heavier focus on her personal story than previous nominees. \u201cThis is the why part of the conversation. Why is she running for president? What is her vision for the country?\u201d said Mr Simmons, her former communications director. \u201cThat will help tie together all of the strands of her policy and political life that will make sense for people.\u201d But over the course of four days, Ms Harris will need to sharpen her messaging around crime, inflation, the economy and immigration \u2013 issues the Trump campaign will relentlessly target between now and election day. Whit Ayres, a longtime Republican strategist, said Ms Harris will also at some point have to clarify the left-leaning positions she took in 2019 during her failed presidential bid. \"Her greatest vulnerability is that there is plenty of evidence that she's a San Francisco liberal with a whole set of far left wing policy positions that are outside the mainstream of American thinking, and she hasn't had to answer for those yet,\" he said.",

        "text": "CBS News poll: Gender gap, enthusiasm, economy make for tight Harris-Trump race on Democratic convention eve\nWhen Kamala Harris became the Democratic presidential nominee, the party saw a major surge in enthusiasm from its voters. It pulled the party into an effectively even race with Donald Trump and Republicans, and it has continued to motivate Democrats to vote today.\n\nShe and Trump are even across the battleground states that will decide the Electoral College, and now Harris has a 3-point edge nationally.\n\nThe late-changing campaign has also opened an historic dynamic, a race within the race to define both Harris and the key issues.\n\nTrump, for his part, keeps a lot of his advantages: he leads with people who say the economy is a major factor, and he leads with voters who say they aren't doing as well financially.\n\nYet voters tell us it's about more issues than that \u2014 abortion, the state of democracy, the border among them \u2014 and the contest is marked by a pronounced gender gap between men and women and very different views of which candidate would help them.\n\nHeading into the convention, many voters are still learning about Harris, creating a crucial test for the party this week. A third says they don't yet know what she stands for. Most voters think her views are similar \u2014 but not entirely the same \u2014 as Joe Biden's. And she's somewhat \u2014 but not entirely \u2014 seen as connected to Mr. Biden's economy.\n\nDemocrats have continued to close the gap with Republicans in expressing their intention to vote; today, they are effectively even with Republicans in saying so.\n\nBehind the gender-gap election\n\nThe gender gap has grown a little more and is approaching 2020 levels now. But it's more than a vote break. It underpins very different priorities and perceptions.\n\nFirst, women are more likely than men to see Harris as someone who \"fights for people like you\" a lot. And women are likelier to see Harris than Trump as fighting for people like them.\n\nSecond, views on gender equality efforts connect to voting.\n\nPeople who think efforts at promoting gender equality between men and women are going too far in America today are voting overwhelmingly for Trump. That's especially the case for men who think so.\n\nThose who think efforts to promote equally aren't going far enough or are about right are for Harris.\n\nThird, women help Harris on the economy more than they did Mr. Biden.\n\nThough still trailing Trump on the issue, Harris is doing 8 points better than Mr. Biden was in June among women who say the economy is a major factor for them. She's effectively even with Trump now among this group. She is also 7 points better from where Mr. Biden was in June among women who say inflation is a major factor.\n\nAbortion: Deja-vu from '22?\n\nFor rank-and-file Democrats, abortion and the state of democracy outpace the economy as major factors in their vote.\n\nPro-abortion rights voters may feel even better about Harris than about Mr. Biden, at least in terms of vote. She gets a higher vote share than he was getting among women who want abortion to be legal.\n\nAnd 71% of voters think Harris will try to pass a national law protecting abortion.\n\nThree-quarters of voters want mifepristone available. Nine in 10 believe Harris would make or keep it so, while seven in 10 say Trump will try to restrict access to it.\n\nBut Democrats are far more likely than independents or Republicans to call abortion a major factor.\n\nFewer voters overall say abortion is a \"major factor\" in their vote than say the economy is.\n\nSo a key metric to watch in this campaign is whether that view expands more beyond the party's ranks.\n\nThe race to define Harris (And how much separation from Biden does she need?)\n\nPeople know Trump, agree with him or not. Nearly nine in 10 voters say they know what he stands for.\n\nBut it's a little less so for Harris, as she's just become the nominee. Around a third say they don't know what she stands for yet.\n\nThis adds another key to watch at the convention as Democrats try to define her message before the Trump campaign does.\n\nPeople who think her policy views are entirely the same as Mr. Biden's, who are mostly Republicans, are voting for Trump.\n\nBut Harris does better among voters who think her views are mostly but not entirely the same as Mr. Biden's. This clearly goes for Democrats, but it goes for independents too.\n\nHow tied is she to Biden's economy?\n\nThe economy has long been seen as bad, but Harris' role as vice president is only somewhat tied to it.\n\nMost voters across party lines say Harris' decisions as vice president have impacted the U.S. economy at least some, but few say they have had \"a lot\" of impact.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump leads in perceptions of being able to make food and grocery prices go down. This was measured largely prior to Harris laying out inflation plans in a Friday speech. However that sentiment looks to be driven more by general confidence than by any particular policy.\n\nWhen we follow up with voters who think Trump winning means lower grocery prices for them and ask why, most say it's mainly because of a \"general confidence\" they have in Trump rather than specific policies they've heard him propose.\n\nWhether Trump can keep or expand that gap, or Harris can start to close it, could be another key item to watch at the convention and in the coming weeks.\n\nHow tied is she to the border?\n\nTrump remains overwhelmingly seen by voters as having policies that would reduce border crossings.\n\nTrump also leads among those who say the border is a major factor in their vote. In fact it is the largest lead he has among any issue group, even higher than inflation. (That's partially because Republicans overwhelmingly call it a factor.)\n\nHarris is somewhat, but not entirely, tied to U.S. border policy: a third think her decisions as vice president had \"a lot\" to do with the current situation. While this is largely driven by Republicans, this is higher than the number of voters that connect her decisions as vice president to the economy.\n\nBut border crossing attempts are reportedly down, and the percentage of voters calling the border a crisis, while still high, is down slightly from the spring.\n\nFor all that, so much of this contest is already locked in. Very few voters express openness to considering another candidate \u2014 more evidence this will probably be decided by turnout.\n\nSo, for Democrats, the convention will in part be about maintaining that enthusiasm among the base.\n\nUpdated state-level estimates from CBS News' statistical model show close races in all seven battlegrounds \u2014 they are all well within the margin of error, with both Harris and Trump in position to win if the election were today.\n\nHere's how the issues shape up relating to vote choice. Voters can identify multiple items as factors in their decision.\n\nAnd that all leads into the Democrats' convention as a guide to what to watch, as they \u2014 and Republicans countering it \u2014 compete in the contest within the contest to define what 2024 will ultimately be about.\n\nThis CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a representative sample of 3,258 registered voters nationwide interviewed between August 14-16, 2024. The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, and education based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and the U.S. Census Current Population Survey, as well as past vote. Respondents were selected to be representative of registered voters nationwide. The margin of error for registered voters is \u00b12.1 points.\n\nBattlegrounds are AZ, GA, MI, NC, NV, PA, and WI.\n\n",

        "text": "Protests across Venezuela as election dispute continues\nProtests across Venezuela as election dispute goes on\n\nReuters Demonstrations have been held across Venezuela and in cities around the world\n\nOpposition supporters have gathered across Venezuela to protest against Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's disputed victory in last month's presidential election. Opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado joined thousands of protesters in the capital, Caracas, and urged them not to be afraid. Ms Machado, who had been in hiding after being accused of insurrection, said there was nothing above the voice of the people, and that the people had spoken. Police and the army were deployed in force as supporters of Mr Maduro also held a demonstration.\n\n\"We won't leave the streets,\" Ms Machado told protesters, with many of them waving copies of election records from their voting stations as proof of victory. Ms Machado, who was banned from running in the election, had called for nationwide protests to intensify pressure on Mr Maduro to concede. Some demonstrators seemed determined to carry on. \"This is a criminal government that wants to hold on to power. I smell freedom, I have nothing to fear,\" said Adriana Calzadilla, quoted by AFP news agency. \u201cI hope for Maduro to recognise his defeat and hand over the power peacefully,\" medical student Jos\u00e9 Berbin told Reuters. \"What I think will happen is that the dictatorship will get harder, we all need to unite against the dictatorship and show that good people are more.\u201d Mr Maduro has insisted he won a third six-year term, but the opposition released tallies it said showed its candidate, Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, winning by a wide margin. Speaking from an unidentified location, Mr Gonz\u00e1lez said it was time for an \"orderly transition\". At his rival rally, Mr Maduro mocked Mr Gonz\u00e1lez, saying he was \"living in a cave\". The electoral commission, controlled by allies of Mr Maduro, has refused to release detailed results, but declared he won with 52% of the vote. Independent observers said it lacked transparency.\n\nReuters Thousands of supporters of Mr Maduro also gathered in the capital and other cities",

        "text": "Trump campaign reset goes awry in Pennsylvania as he attacks Harris\nDonald Trump tried to reset his campaign at a rally in battleground Pennsylvania on Saturday as polls show Kamala Harris pulling ahead in key swing states.\n\nBut the former president quickly broke away from the prepared speech about economic issues to launch personal attacks on Harris including accusations that her agenda is both communist and fascist, and that she has \u201cthe laugh of a crazy person\u201d.\n\nTrump\u2019s written speech before a mostly filled 8,000-seat indoor arena in Wilkes-Barre focussed on economic policy, although a part of the audience left before he finished speaking. Some Republican strategists had hoped the former president could regain the initiative by zeroing in on issues which opinion polls say voters have greater trust in Trump than the Democrats, such as inflation.\n\nTrump attacked Harris as part of the Biden administration for the surge in prices that has hit many Americans hard and described increased household costs as \u201cthe Kamala Harris inflation tax\u201d.\n\n\u201cShe was there for everything,\u201d he said in attempting to pin Biden\u2019s policies on her.\n\nTrump also likened Harris\u2019s pledge on Friday to tackle high grocery costs by targeting profiteering by food corporations, and to bring down housing and prescription drug costs, to the Soviet Union\u2019s economic system.\n\n\u201cIn her speech yesterday, Kamala went full communist,\u201d he said. \u201cComrade Kamala announced that she wants to institute socialist price controls. You saw that never worked before \u2026 it will cause rationing, hunger and skyrocketing prices.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Trump in Wilkes-Barre today. Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe former president challenged voters to ask themselves whether they were \u201cbetter off with Kamala and Biden than you were under President Donald J Trump\u201d, a question that many in Pennsylvania might answer in his favour.\n\nBut the impact was soon lost as Trump once again veered repeatedly away from the script with rambling discourses from immigration to China and trans people, often based on outright falsehoods.\n\nAt one point, he even acknowledged that was what he was doing.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll say he was rambling. I don\u2019t ramble. I\u2019m a really smart guy, you know, really smart. I don\u2019t ramble. But the other day, anytime I hit too hard, they say he was rambling, rambling,\u201d he said.\n\nThe audience, some wearing T-shirts proclaiming \u201cI\u2019m voting for a convicted felon\u201d and chanting \u201cFight, fight, fight\u201d in reference to the former president\u2019s words shortly after he narrowly escaped an assassination attempt last month, urged Trump on.\n\nWhen he returned to the script, Trump attacked Harris for her previous opposition to fracking, an unpopular stance in Pennsylvania, which is a major fracker, but he will not have helped himself in the Rust belt by saying he would cut spending on infrastructure such as renewing bridges and roads, which has provided jobs in the region.\n\nTrump also challenged Harris\u2019s legitimacy as the Democratic presidential candidate, describing it as \u201ca coup\u201d against Biden.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This was an overthrow of a president,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump confused some in the audience with what appeared to be a claim that if Harris could become the candidate without a primary election, then so should he because he is so popular among Republicans.\n\n\u201cI said, so why are we having an election? They didn\u2019t have an election. Why are we having an election?\u201d he said.\n\nTrump described Harris\u2019s decision to pass over Pennsylvania\u2019s governor, Josh Shapiro, as her running mate, as antisemitism in an apparent reference to debate about whether Shapiro\u2019s support for Israel, including work for the Israel embassy in the past, would damage the Democratic campaign because of the war on Gaza.\n\n\u201cThey turned him down because he\u2019s Jewish. That\u2019s why they turned him down. Now, we can be politically correct and not say that. I could say, well, they turned him down for various reasons. No, no, they turned him down because he\u2019s Jewish,\u201d said Trump.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ll tell you this, any Jewish person that votes for her or a Democrat has to go out and have their head examined.\u201d\n\nThrough it all, Trump repeatedly returned to personal attacks on Harris, including a bizarre discourse on how she laughs, a mannerism that has proven popular among many younger voters in particular.\n\n\u201cHave you heard her laugh? That is the laugh of a crazy person. That is the laugh of a crazy, the laugh of a lunatic,\u201d he said.",

Among those now registered to vote, it's 49%-45%, a slight Harris advantage given sampling tolerances. And Harris has a 6-point lead among likely voters, 51%-45%.\n\nRoughly echoing these results, this poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates with fieldwork by Ipsos, also finds that more people see Harris as qualified for the job, 53%, than say the same about Trump, 47%.\n\nSee PDF for full results.\n\n2024 Vote Preference ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll\n\nIn a five-way matchup, the poll finds Harris/Walz and Trump/Vance at 47%-44% among the general public and registered voters alike, and 49%-45% among likely voters. None of these is a statistically significant difference, suggesting the Democrats would prefer a two-way race.\n\nThat said, among all adults, support for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (and his running mate Nicole Shanahan) is down to 5%, from a peak of 12% in April. Cornel West/Melina Abdullah have 1%, as does Jill Stein of the Green Party.\n\nThese candidates' ballot access is to be determined; per ABC News estimates, Kennedy currently is on the ballot in 21 states, Stein in 20 and West in eight.\n\nCandidate attributes\n\nUnderlying shifts from July are dramatic, particularly in views of some candidate attributes. There also are sharp increases in Democrats' satisfaction with the presidential matchup and enthusiasm for their candidate.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump speaks during a news conference at Trump National Bedminster Clubhouse in Bedminster, NJ, August 15, 2024. Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images\n\nAmong all adults, Harris leads on two measures on which Biden lagged badly. Americans by a wide 56%-26% pick her over Trump as having the physical health to serve effectively as president, reversing Trump's 31-point lead over Biden on this attribute last month. And Harris leads Trump by 9 percentage points in being seen as having the mental sharpness it takes to serve effectively, erasing a 30-point Trump lead over Biden on this measure.\n\nHarris also leads Trump by 15 points on honesty and trustworthiness and by 6 points in better-representing people's personal values, both roughly matching Biden's position before he left the race. And she leads Trump by 7 points in empathy -- understanding the problems of people like you -- an important gauge on which Biden and Trump were essentially even in July.\n\nPersonal Attributes ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos polls\n\nThere's another characteristic particular to Harris: Thirty-eight percent of Americans say that having a woman serve as president would be a good thing for the country, far more than the 14% who see it as a bad thing. The rest, 47%, say it makes no difference. (Forty percent of women call a woman president a good thing, as do 35% of men.)\n\nStrength/enthusiasm\n\nIn another sharp change, 60% of Harris' backers support her strongly, matching Trump's strong support and compared with just 34% strong support for Biden last month.\n\nFurther, 50% overall say they'd be enthusiastic or satisfied if Harris were elected, compared with 36% who said that about Biden in early 2023, even before concerns about his cognitive age grew. Just among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, enthusiasm or satisfaction with Harris as their candidate is 19 points higher than Biden's at that time, at 91% versus 72%.\n\nForty-five percent overall say they'd be enthusiastic or satisfied with a Trump victory, about the same as in early 2023 (43%). It's 85% among Republicans and GOP-leaning independents, up 6 points.\n\nTo be sure, fewer than half of Americans, 44%, are satisfied with a Harris-Trump matchup, with 55% dissatisfied. But that's sharply improved from views on a Biden-Trump race, with which just 28% were satisfied, 71% dissatisfied, last month.\n\nViews on Candidates ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos polls\n\nIt's also the case that Harris' choice of Walz as her running mate has been better received than Trump's selection of Vance, as reported Friday.\n\nKey issues\n\nAt the same time, Trump leads Harris by 9 points in trust to handle the economy and inflation alike, roughly maintaining his position on these issues against Biden last month. More than 85% of adults rate both of these as highly important in their vote for president, tops among 11 issues tested.\n\nTrump also leads Harris, by 10 points, in trust to handle the immigration situation at the U.S.-Mexico border, versus a 14-point Trump lead in July. But other issues surpass immigration in importance, including health care, on which Harris leads Trump by 7 points; protecting American democracy, Harris +6; and crime and safety, on which they're close.\n\nNotably, the gap on crime and safety has narrowed from a Trump lead, +7 points, in July, to Trump +3 points now, not a significant gap. And Harris leads by 5 points in trust to handle gun violence, compared with a virtual tie for Biden (+1) against Trump in July. Both shifts may reflect Harris' credentials as a former prosecutor.\n\nHarris also leads, by 5 points, in trust to handle appointments to the U.S. Supreme Court. Among items lower on the importance list, she leads Trump by 12 points in trust to handle abortion and 14 points to handle race relations, while he's +5 points on handling the Israel/Hamas war (down from +9 against Biden).\n\nElection Issues: Importance and Trust ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos polls\n\nCandidate influence\n\nWhile Trump leads in trust to handle the economy and immigration, most people give Harris at least somewhat of a pass on the Biden administration's policies on both issues. The public by about a 2-1 margin, 64%-33%, thinks Harris had limited influence on Biden's economic policies, and by 57%-39% says the same about her influence on immigration policies.\n\nEconomic views matter, given the issue's importance. With 72% of Americans rating the economy negatively, Trump is sure to seek to pin blame on Harris, and she to try to avoid it. Currently, he leads by 61%-33% among those who rate the economy negatively; she, by 89%-8% among those who rate it positively. Wednesday's new inflation figure, a low since early 2021, may offer help to Harris, but prices and interest rates still have risen sharply on the Biden/Harris watch, and recession fears are afoot.\n\nTrump may face more of a challenge on the abortion issue. Although fewer rate it as highly important, it's also the case that Americans by 56%-39% think Trump had substantial influence in bringing about the U.S. Supreme Court decision eliminating the constitutional right to an abortion -- a decision the public opposes by 62%-35%.\n\nSupporters of the abortion ruling support Trump by 81%-13%, but the majority that opposes it supports Harris, by 72%-25%. Indeed, among people who think Trump had a larger role in bringing about the abortion ruling, Harris leads, 69%-28%. Among those who think Trump had less influence, that flips to a 73%-22% Trump lead.\n\nVote-preference gaps based on views of Harris' influence on economic and immigration policy are far less pronounced, and run in the opposite direction. She does 10 points better with people who think she's had more influence on economic policy, and 9 points better among those who think she had more influence on immigration policy, both compared with those who think she's had less influence.\n\nCandidates' Influence ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll\n\nVote groups\n\nSome of the changes among groups from Biden to Harris are striking. Among them:\n\nIndependents went from +4 points for Trump in July to +11 Harris now, a 15-point swing. Classic swing voters, independents have gone with the winner in nine of the last 12 presidential elections, all but those in 2012, 2004 and 1976.\n\n\n\nPeople younger than age 40 have moved from +2 Biden in July to +20 for Harris now, an 18-point swing.\n\n\n\nWomen age 18-29 split about evenly (Trump +2) in July; now they favor Harris by 23 points, a 25-point swing in this group. It's almost as big, an 18-point swing to Harris, among women age 30 to 49. Harris also has improved from Biden's score among men age 18-29, from Biden +1 in July to Harris +14 now, a 13-point swing.\n\n\n\nSupport from Black people has swung by 12 points in Harris' direction, from +60 for Biden in July to +72 for Harris now. Her gain is about equal among Black men and Black women alike. (Harris is a Black and South Asian person. The sample size of Asians in this survey is too small for a vote-preference estimate, but a combination of the last two surveys with a Harris-Trump matchup, the first done before Biden withdrew, finds Harris ahead of Trump among Asians by 65%-32%.)\n\n\n\nHarris has seen an 8-point swing among Hispanic people. That's occurred mostly among Hispanic women, a 17-point swing from +2 for Trump in July to +15 for Harris now.\n\n\n\nIn the middle-income range, people with household incomes from $50,000 to $99,999 have gone from Trump +7 in July to Harris +8 now, a 15-point shift.\n\nVote Choice Change Among Key Groups ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos polls\n\nLooking ahead\n\nSome potential voters may be persuadable in the campaign ahead. Among people who don't currently support Trump, 12% say they'd consider voting for him. Among those who don't now support Harris, an almost equal number, 11%, say they'd consider her.\n\nThe question is how the candidates attract new supporters while keeping their bases motivated. Appeals on ideological lines seem thin: While 46% see Harris as too liberal, as Trump consistently charges, almost as many, 42%, see him as too conservative.\n\nAnother challenging line is Trump's contention that the Democratic Party encouraged the sentiment that led to an attempt on his life. Instead, more Americans blame the Republican Party for the risk of politically motivated violence in this country, 37%, than blame the Democrats, 26%; an additional 25% blame both equally.\n\nBest for Trump is his advantage on the economy and Harris' association with Biden, who labors under a 37%-55% job approval rating, essentially steady the past 15 months. Indeed, Harris' own rating for handling her job as vice president is just 39%-49%. But Trump's retrospective rating also is underwater, 44%-49%. And at this stage, at least, Harris possesses one potentially crucial election commodity: momentum.\n\nMethodology\n\nThis ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll was conducted online via the probability-based Ipsos KnowledgePanel\u00ae Aug. 9-13, 2024, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 2,336 adults. Partisan divisions are 29%-29%-29%, Democrats-Republicans-independents. Results have a margin of sampling error of 2 percentage points, including the design effect, for the full sample. Sampling error is not the only source of differences in polls.\n\nThe survey was produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates, with sampling and data collection by Ipsos.

        "text": "Kamala Harris bets America is ready for first Black woman President\nIs America ready to elect a Black woman as its president? Vice President Kamala Harris, who will be officially confirmed as the Democratic US presidential nominee in Chicago next week, is betting that it is.\n\n\"In my entire career, I've heard people say when I ran... people aren't ready, it's not your time, nobody like you has done that before,\" the Democrat said in 2019 when she ran against Joe Biden in the primary presidential campaign.\n\nAlso read | In Tim Walz, Kamala Harris gets a trump card to trump Trump\n\n\"I haven't listened and I would suggest that nobody should listen to that kind of conversation.\"\n\nBut Ms. Harris's campaign never took off and she left the primaries race before Biden picked her as his running mate.\n\nIf Ms. Harris, 59, manages to beat Donald Trump in November, she will become the first woman and the second Black person, after Barack Obama, to run the world's leading power.\n\nTrailblazer\n\nIn so many ways, Ms. Harris already is a trailblazer. Born to an Indian mother and a Jamaican father, she was the first woman attorney general ever elected in California, on top of being the first African American and Asian American to hold that post. She then became the first vice president in US history in those same categories.\n\nIn a survey published in September 2023, the Pew Research Center, a Washington-based think tank, found that for a majority of Americans, gender does not play a role in choosing a president.\n\nSixty percent of respondents said that a female president would handle pressure as well as a man, while 27 percent believed that she would do better.\n\n\"While female leadership \u2014 whether as presidents, queens, prime ministers, and heads of state \u2014 has become the norm in many parts of the world, including Europe, Asia, South America, and African nations, the United States has yet to experience this moment,\" said Sonia Gipson Rankin, a law professor at the University of New Mexico.\n\nShe noted that even though Democrat Hillary Clinton lost the electoral college and therefore the presidency to Trump in 2016, she won the popular vote.\n\nStrategic discrimination\n\nRegina Bateson, a professor of political science at the University of Colorado Boulder, believes that voters' biases may not themselves be the issue.\n\n\"The problem is often not that voters are actually biased,\" Bateson said. \"It's that party insiders and delegates and political donors worry that the voters will be biased.\"\n\nThat leads them to withhold support from a woman of color, a phenomenon that Bateson calls \"strategic discrimination,\" which usually manifests itself during the primaries when a candidate must demonstrate that he or she is able to rally many groups of voters.\n\nMs. Harris, however, took over from Mr. Biden after the 81-year-old leader withdrew from the race, thus sparing her \"this process of trying to convince people that she's electable\" during the primaries.\n\nFlanked by her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a 60-year-old white man, Harris now hopes to win the trust of all Americans, regardless of ethnicity or gender.\n\nSome are already convinced such as \"White dudes for Harris,\" a group that brought nearly 200,000 people together for a Zoom fundraiser for Harris in late July, raising more than $4 million.\n\nDonald Trump didn't wait long to attack his Democratic rival on her background.\n\nThe billionaire charged that Ms. Harris \"turned Black\" only recently in order to win electoral support.\n\nMs. Harris, who had always spoken of her Black and Asian heritage with pride, called out Trump for his \"divisiveness and disrespect.\"\n\nThe former President's running mate, J.D. Vance, caused an outcry recently when a 2021 video resurfaced in which he dismisses the Democratic Party as being run by \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives... and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too.\"\n\nMs. Harris is married to Douglas Emhoff and helped in raising his two children from a previous marriage. She does not have any biological children of her own.\n\nMr. Vance's comments caused a backlash amplified by Hollywood stars such as Jennifer Aniston and Glenn Close, and were widely considered a political misstep in a country where the fertility rate is historically low.\n\nVance has sought to walk back his remarks saying they were taken out of context.",

The networking is always a good thing. It\u2019s a fellowship, of sorts.\u201d\n\nOne recent meeting in the immediate aftermath of President Joe Biden\u2019s suspension of his reelection campaign took on special weight as attendees considered the prospect of a Black woman winning the presidency. The candidacy of Vice President Kamala Harris has refocused attention on Black men, a demographic that Democrats and Republicans view as persuadable but whose multifaceted experiences and political preferences often go unaddressed in public debate.\n\nHarris\u2019 campaign has also reignited discussions amongst Black men about their influence in this election.\n\n\u201cBlack men are the target, and we hold the keys to the kingdom. This is our moment,\u201d said Lance Robertson, executive director of the Black City Councilmen of Georgia, during the meeting. \u201cThe Black man has built America. Now it\u2019s time for the Black man to save America.\u201d\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nBlack male voters are traditionally one of the most consistently Democratic leaning demographics in the nation. This year, however, both major parties view Black men, especially those under the age of 40, as attainable voters. Whether Black men turn out in high numbers and to what degree they maintain traditional support for Democratic candidates may prove decisive in November.\n\nAttendees gather and pray during a Black Man Lab meeting to discuss the candidacy of Vice President Kamala Harris, Monday, July 22, 2024, in Atlanta.

I think they feel they have something that they can support. I think a lot of issues which made a lot of them skeptical are being addressed.\u201d\n\nAt the Black Man Lab event, the men present came from all walks of life. Attendees\u2019 ages ranged from 8 to 86, with multiple pairings of fathers, grandfathers and grandsons telling the group about the unique circumstances each generation faces as Black men in America.\n\nBlack voters have historically prioritized policies on civil rights and economic mobility, leading to overwhelming support for Democrats.\n\nBut how those concerns translate into political preferences has shifted as traditional ties to institutions like the Black church have frayed for some younger Black Americans. \u201cThe Black church, in a lot of respects, has been a turnoff for the Black man, and we\u2019re only now working to address the need and correct it,\u201d Jackson said.\n\nMawuli Davis, an attorney and human rights organizer, facilitates a panel discussion on the candidacy of Vice President Kamala Harris during a Black Men Lab meeting, Monday, July 22, 2024, in Atlanta.

Greenwood, who supports Harris, said economic messages will be most important to Black male voters.\n\nHarris\u2019 entrance into the presidential race has unleashed a flurry of organizing among her Black male allies. A day after Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris, a virtual conference tailored for Black men garnered more than 53,000 attendees and raised more than $1.3 million. The event, organized by Win With Black Men, a collective of Black male-led groups, has hosted regular meetings every week since then to engage organizers targeting Black men.\n\n\u201cUp until this point, these folks were not really engaged with this campaign season, let alone volunteering for outside organizations. I think what we\u2019re seeing now is a massive level of organic energy that you can\u2019t deny,\u201d said Quentin James, founder of the Collective PAC, a Democratic political action committee that supports Black candidates.\n\nAttendees gather and pray during a Black Man Lab meeting to discuss the candidacy of Vice President Kamala Harris, Monday, July 22, 2024, in Atlanta.

More than 150 groups have applied for support. James stressed that while the recent fundraising windfall is notable, the Harris campaign\u2019s own engagement effort with Black men may not be enough unless it is paired with robustly funded outside groups that have longstanding trust in local communities.\n\nHarris has also revamped her outreach to Black men. The campaign believes it has a winning message for Black men\u2019s priorities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s wealth and it\u2019s health,\u201d Democratic strategist Antjuan Seawright said of the message.\n\nSeawright leads the Democratic National Committee\u2019s \u201cChop It Up\u201d town halls for Black men at barbershops and other venues in battleground states this year. He noted that Black men \u201caren\u2019t monolithic\u201d and added that it is a mistake for campaigns to assume \u201cwe only care about criminal justice reform.\u201d\n\nThe culminating effort also aims to address longstanding skepticism among many Black men about the political system, which is seen as discriminatory and unresponsive to their interests. Others have tackled potential hesitancy among men about electing a woman to the nation\u2019s highest office.\n\nRepublicans, too, see an opportunity to make inroads with Black men precisely because of those longstanding frustrations. Donald Trump often speaks of his interest in garnering greater Black voter support. Black Republicans, including Reps. Byron Donalds of Florida and Wesley Hunt of Texas, have hosted a \u201cCongress, Cognac, and Cigars\u201d event series in cities including Atlanta, Philadelphia and Milwaukee.\n\n\u201cBlack men have been taken for granted by the Democratic Party for years, but President Trump\u2019s message is resonating at historic levels because he is doing the work,\u201d said Janiyah Thomas, Black media director for the Trump campaign.\n\nPanelists answer questions during a panel discussion on the candidacy of Vice President Kamala Harris during a Black Men Lab meeting, Monday, July 22, 2024, in Atlanta.

Kamala Harris Photo : AP\n\nWashington, DC: Former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has claimed at an election rally that he is \"much better looking\" than his Democratic rival for the White House -- Vice-President Kamala Harris .\n\nSpeaking at an election rally in Pennsylvania, which is one of the battleground states that will determine the race, Trump said, \"I am much better looking than her. I think I'm a better-looking person than Kamala.\"\n\nTrump appears to have been triggered by a column in The Wall Street Journal that described Harris as beautiful. \"You can't take a bad picture of her. Her beauty, plus the social warmth that all who have known her over the years speak of, combines to produce: radiance,\" Peggy Noonan, the columnist, had written.\n\nTrump leaned into it by calling out to a Republican who is running for US Senate from the state. \"You're not allowed to say this anymore. You know, David, don't ever get caught in this trap,\" Trump said addressing Republican Senate candidate David McCormick in the audience. \"David, please don't ever call a woman beautiful, because that will be the end of your political career.\"\n\n\"I am much better looking than her. I'm a better-looking person than Kamala,\" he said and went on to belittle a sketch of her on a Time magazine cover. He said he thought it was actresses Sophia Loren or Elizabeth Taylor.\n\nFormer President Trump also attacked Harris on policy calling the economic plan she announced on Friday as a plan that \"will usher communism in the US\". He has called it the \"Maduro plan\", after Nicolas Maduro, the Venezuelan leader.\n\nTrump has used a string of personal slurs against Harris in the last three weeks. He has called her \"crazy\" and a \"lunatic\", questioned her ethnicity, and even stated that he is \"entitled\" to these personal attacks because she makes him angry and she has also attacked him as \"weird\".",

        "text": "U.S. intelligence officials warn of Iran's attempts to interfere in presidential election\nWhat we know about Iran hacking targeting 2024 presidential campaigns, election\n\nWashington \u2014 Iran's efforts to interfere with the 2024 presidential election are growing more aggressive as they target political campaigns \u2014 including GOP nominee Donald Trump's \u2014 and the American public with cyber and influence operations, three federal intelligence agencies said in a warning issued Monday.\n\nThe rare joint statement from the FBI, Office of the Director of National Intelligence and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) said the measures Iran is taking to \"stoke discord and undermine confidence in our democratic institutions\" have increased because the nation's government \"perceives this year's elections to be particularly consequential\" for its domestic policies.\n\nIntelligence officials for the first time publicly blamed Iran-backed hackers for the targeting of the Trump campaign, which revealed last week that it had been hacked and blamed Iranian actors for stealing and distributing sensitive internal documents.\n\nThree sources familiar with the investigation confirmed to CBS News that federal investigators suspected Iranian hackers targeted individuals associated with the Trump and Biden-Harris campaigns. The FBI launched the probes in the early summer after both presidential campaigns experienced attempted phishing schemes targeting campaign staff, the sources said.\n\nAccording to Monday's statement, the intelligence community said it is \"confident that the Iranians have through social engineering and other efforts sought access to individuals with direct access to the Presidential campaigns of both political parties.\"\n\n\"Such activity, including thefts and disclosures, are intended to influence the U.S. election process,\" the statement said.\n\nA senior official with the Harris campaign said last week, \"We are not aware of any security breaches of our systems.\"\n\nThe Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the U.N. denied the intelligence community's accusations.\n\n\"Such allegations are unsubstantiated and devoid of any standing,\" the Iranian mission said in a statement Monday. \"As we have previously announced, the Islamic Republic of Iran harbors neither the intention nor the motive to interfere with the U.S. presidential election. Should the U.S. government genuinely believe in the validity of its claims, it should furnish us with the pertinent evidence\u2014if any\u2014to which we will respond accordingly.\"\n\nU.S. officials including the director of national intelligence and the heads of the FBI and CISA have warned of campaigns by foreign adversaries to undermine American elections, and Monday's statement makes clear the approach Iran is taking \"is not new.\"\n\nIn the runup to the 2020 presidential election, FBI Director Christopher Wray and then-Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said Iran was working to \"damage\" Donald Trump's reelection efforts. And during the 2016 presidential race, Russian hackers stole and disseminated the emails of then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"This activity demonstrates the Iranians' increased intent to exploit our online platforms in support of their objectives,\" the officials warned Monday.\n\nThe FBI and CISA said last week that they \"have no reporting to suggest cyber activity, to include ransomware, has ever prevented a registered voter from casting a ballot, compromised the integrity of any ballots cast, or affected the accuracy of vote tabulation or voter registration information.\"\n\n\"While ransomware attacks against state or local government networks or election infrastructure could cause localized delays, they will not compromise the security or accuracy of vote casting or counting processes,\" they said.\n\ncontributed to this report.",

        "text": "Why I am not voting for Kamala Harris\nI registered to vote in 1998, and I have voted Democrat ever since. I have not always felt good about the candidates on the Democratic ticket. In fact, I have usually felt angry, disillusioned, disappointed and dirty after casting my vote. Still, it felt like part of the job of being a citizen of a pseudo-democracy. It was not the only work to be done, but it was something.\n\nThis November, however, I plan not to vote for the Democrats in the election. If the party\u2019s presidential candidate, Kamala Harris, does not change her policy on Israel, I will not be casting a ballot for her.\n\nAnd I will not be the only one. More than 700,000 Americans have cast an \u201cuncommitted\u201d vote in the Democratic primaries, demonstrating their rejection of the Democratic Party\u2019s \u201cironclad\u201d support for Israel.\n\nIf Harris wants the progressive vote, she has to support an arms embargo on Israel and stop funding the Israeli genocide of Palestinians in Gaza. This is a red line for many of us who have not bought into her liberal cult of personality.\n\nWhen President Joe Biden finally dropped out as the 2024 Democratic nominee on July 21, I was not one of the many people celebrating his endorsement of the vice president. Harris was on the wrong side of history as San Francisco\u2019s district attorney when she opposed criminal justice reform, and she has been on the wrong side of history in regards to Israel, which she is a staunch supporter of.\n\nStill, a small part of me hoped she would be savvy enough to understand the power of the \u201cuncommitted\u201d movement \u2013 which is conditioning voting on support for an embargo on Israel and a permanent ceasefire in Gaza \u2013 and the level of outrage felt by those opposed to the ongoing genocide, funded these past 10 months by US aid. I was wrong.\n\nAt a rally in Detroit on August 7, Harris was met by a group of anti-genocide, pro-Palestine protesters chanting, \u201cKamala, Kamala, you can\u2019t hide! We won\u2019t vote for genocide!\u201d In a democracy, this is a perfectly reasonable and acceptable (if not necessary) action. Politicians serve the people, and the people have the right (and the responsibility) to make demands on their political leaders, especially when the latter are asking for their votes and campaign donations.\n\nYet Harris decided to respond: \u201cYou know what? If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I\u2019m speaking.\u201d\n\nWhat purpose does this attitude serve? The protesters were merely expressing their demand that Harris pledge to stop arming Israel amid its genocidal war on Gaza. A war that has brought the official death toll in Gaza to more than 40,000; some estimates project that number to reach 186,000 or even higher. A war that has put one million children at risk of famine, according to the international nonprofit organisation Save the Children. A war that has decimated Gaza\u2019s health sector, bringing back polio infections for the first time in 25 years.\n\nMany of us spend our days scrolling through the most horrific images imaginable \u2013 toddlers beheaded by Israeli air strikes, people burned alive in their tents, emaciated children who die of starvation, political prisoners brutally raped by Israeli soldiers. The atrocities go on and on. My days and nights are haunted by these images, and none of this would be possible without US aid, without our tax dollars.\n\nBut Harris doesn\u2019t want to engage these very reasonable demands \u2013 to stop funding this slaughter, this genocide, this horrific violence. Instead, she wants to be celebrated for being charismatic, for her affect, for her vibes.\n\nThis politics-as-vibes is not new. It is nothing more than celebrity culture bleeding into politics. Another word for it is fascism.\n\nI am reminded of Erik Larson\u2019s 2011 book In the Garden of Beasts: Love, Terror, and an American Family in Hitler\u2019s Berlin, which tells the story of William Dodd, the US ambassador to Germany from 1933 to 1937 and his family. Over the years since the book was published, I have thought occasionally of Dodd and often of his daughter, Martha, who accompanied him to Berlin.\n\nThe ambassador was chairman of the history department at the University of Chicago at the time of his appointment, and he just wanted to be left alone to finish his book about the antebellum American South. He was somewhat concerned but not too alarmed about what was happening in Germany, telling President Franklin Roosevelt, \u201cGive men a chance to try their schemes\u201d as the Nazi Party prepared to deny Jews citizenship.\n\nMartha, on the other hand, was swept up by the \u201cglamour\u201d of the Nazi Party and its social scene, dating and sleeping with Nazi officers.\n\nSo many liberals I know are a form of William or Martha Dodd. Like William, they are either too consumed with their own comfort to care too much about the daily atrocities experienced and endured by Palestinians, or, like Martha, they approach politics through the frame of celebrity culture and good feelings, happy to fangirl Harris, whose charisma and Beyonce-scored inspire-ads overwhelm the pesky reality of genocide.\n\nThis is, after all, about feeling good. \u201cDon\u2019t spoil our fun!\u201d they scream at me (and so many others) on social media. This anti-outrage is deafening. But you cannot just live off vibes.\n\nIn a memoir written a few years after she left Nazi Germany, Martha admitted to just not really liking Jews all that much. This casual anti-Semitism foreshadows today\u2019s liberal attitudes towards Palestinians, a disregard rooted in Islamophobia and anti-Arab racism, which is driving a genocide.\n\nThis is a make-or-break moment \u2013 we must pressure the Democrats to change their position on Gaza before the elections in November. While we should all be doing absolutely everything we can to stop the genocide, the bare minimum right now is demanding that a presidential hopeful, in need of our votes, commits to ending US funds to Israel. It is not that complicated.\n\nHarris may be the lesser of two evils when it comes to Donald Trump, but the lesser of two evils is still evil. If she wants to win in November, she needs to give us more than vibes and celebrity culture \u2013 she needs to make a real commitment to ending the genocide in Gaza, first and foremost by not funding it. Anything less than this will lose her the progressive vote and, quite possibly, the presidency. If this happens, the liberals across the country will likely blame a nebulous \u201cleftist-progressive\u201d block, but in the end, this loss will be on Harris herself.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author\u2019s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera\u2019s editorial stance.",

Iranian officials denied it.\n\nThe FBI and other federal agencies said in a joint statement that Iran had chosen to interfere in the US election \"to stoke discord and undermine confidence in our democratic institutions\".\n\nIran was behind the recent hack of Donald Trump's presidential campaign, US intelligence officials have confirmed.\n\n\u201cThe [intelligence community] is confident that the Iranians have through social engineering and other efforts sought access to individuals with direct access to the Presidential campaigns of both political parties,\u201d US intelligence officials said in the statement.\n\n\"Such activity, including thefts and disclosures, are intended to influence the US election process.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign was reportedly sent a spear-phishing email \u2013 a message designed to look trustworthy in order to get the target to click on a malicious link.\n\nThe Harris campaign said last week it had also been the target of a spear-phishing attack, though it was unsuccessful.\n\nThe agencies that released Monday's statement, including the FBI, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said the tactics were \"not new\" and noted that Russia and Iran had employed such methods during previous US elections.\n\nIt remains unclear what information, if any, was stolen during the hack. Trump said the hackers were only able to obtain publicly available information.\n\nThe New York Times, Politico and The Washington Post said they were leaked confidential information from inside the Trump campaign, including on its vetting of his running mate, JD Vance. The outlets have so far declined to offer specifics.\n\nUS officials said it was clear Iran wanted to shape the outcome of elections it believes are \"particularly consequential in terms of the impact they could have on its national security interests\".\n\nThe American intelligence agencies added that they had \"observed increasingly aggressive Iranian activity during this election cycle\".\n\nThere has been growing concern about potential Iranian hackers.\n\nRecently, Microsoft said it had seen \"the emergence of significant influence activity\" by groups linked to Iran.\n\nBefore he dropped out of the White House race last month, President Joe Biden's campaign was targeted by Iranian hackers, as was Trump's, according to Google.",

In recent years, Washington has increased large sales of U.S. weapons systems to Taipei.\n\nAs rhetoric heats up over whether the U.S. should defend Taiwan in case of a Chinese invasion, there is also growing skepticism in Taiwan over U.S. reliability as a security partner.\n\nA recent survey conducted by the Brookings Institution in Taiwan found only about a quarter of 1,500 adults polled thought the U.S. was a trustworthy ally, though about 55% said they believed the U.S. would come to Taiwan\u2019s aid in the event of a conflict, no matter who is elected U.S. president.\n\nIn Taiwan, the sense of confusion and nervousness is palpable, as Beijing ramps up its intimidation.\n\n\u201cWhat they care about is whether the U.S. has a very explicit commitment to Taiwan's defense, which means [will] the U.S. militarily intervene, instead of just sending signals to Beijing or just sending weapons, arms to Taiwan? People really want to know whether the U.S. Navy or marine forces will help Taiwan to defend itself,\u201d says Ping-Kuei Chen, a professor of diplomacy at National Chengchi University in Taipei.\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\nTaiwan wants to protect its dominance in semiconductor technology\n\nTaiwan is home to dozens of multinational technological manufacturing and semiconductor giants, including TSMC. Its chip industry is now so advanced and critical to the global economy that analysts have nicknamed it a \u201csilicon shield\u201d that protects the island due to its economic importance. This year, Taiwan is expected to manufacture nearly $150 billion worth of semiconductor chips that are critical to smartphones and fighter jets alike.\n\nTaiwan is highly attuned to how the next American president will continue to manage a technological rivalry with China, which has resulted in a raft of strict U.S. semiconductor export controls that have put Taiwanese chipmakers in a bind.\n\nUnder the Biden administration, the U.S. has subsidized new semiconductor facilities in the U.S. at unprecedented levels. Taiwan\u2019s TSMC, arguably the world\u2019s most advanced semiconductor manufacturer, is now setting up three new factories in Arizona to take advantage of U.S. subsidies and tax breaks.\n\nThe investment has been controversial in Taiwan, where some Taiwanese commentators have suggested that the U.S. is working to weaken Taiwan's computer chip industry by shifting production out of Taiwan. One popular misinformation narrative circulating online even claimed that the U.S. was out to destroy Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC. There was no evidence for either claim.\n\nMeanwhile, former President Donald Trump has suggested he would pursue retaliatory measures against Taiwan\u2019s semiconductor sector. \u201cThey took all of our chip business,\u201d the Republican presidential hopeful said last month.\n\n\n\nTaiwan is looking for a stable political partner\n\nIn 2016, support in Taiwan for the U.S. Republican Party surged after Trump broke with precedent and took a call from Taiwan\u2019s then-President Tsai Ying-wen shortly after he was elected U.S. president. The call broke precedent because the U.S. has no formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan, and previous American presidents avoided such public, direct contact for fear of angering China.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHowever, recent comments from the Trump campaign about Taiwan have eroded that support, says Lev Nachman, a political scientist at National Taiwan University.\n\n\u201cYou know, we're no different than an insurance company,\u201d Trump told Bloomberg Businessweek last month. \u201cTaiwan doesn't give us anything,\u201d he said, going on to suggest that Taiwan pay the U.S. for defense.\n\nState Department spokesperson Matthew Miller pointed out that Taiwan does pay for millions of dollars of U.S.-made arms a year. Taiwan\u2019s premier Cho Jung-tai pushed back against Trump\u2019s assertions, saying last month that Taiwan was \u201cwilling\u201d to shoulder more on defense.\n\nIn the recent Brookings survey, conducted shortly before Biden dropped out of the presidential race, researchers found more respondents supported Biden over Trump.\n\nYet the greatest share of respondents \u2014 about 57% \u2014 said they \u201cdid not know\u201d or had \u201cno opinion\u201d about who the next U.S. president should be, suggesting ambivalence about both parties\u2019 policies on Taiwan.\n\nHarris has indicated she will largely keep Biden\u2019s foreign policy positions on China, including pushing back on its territorial claims in the South China Sea.\n\n\u201cWe can interpret our results as people being like, both Republican and Democratic administration seem to do stuff that is good for Taiwan, so we will take either one,\u201d says Nachman, one of the authors of the Brookings survey.",

        "text": "2024 Democratic Party Platform\nDemocratic National Convention\n\nLand Acknowledgement\n\nThe Democratic National Committee wishes to acknowledge that we gather together to state our values on lands that have been stewarded through many centuries by the ancestors and descendants of Tribal Nations who have been here since time immemorial. We honor the communities native to this continent, and recognize that our country was built on Indigenous homelands. We pay our respects to the millions of Indigenous people throughout history who have protected our lands, waters, and animals.\n\nWhile we meet in Chicago, we also recognize and honor the traditional homelands of the Anishinaabe, also known as the Council of the Three Fires: the Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi Nations.\n\nWe acknowledge the many other tribes who consider this area their traditional homeland, including the Myaamia, Ho-Chunk, Menominee, Sac and Fox, Peoria, Kaskaskia, Wea, Kickapoo, and Mascouten.\n\nDemocrats continue to support tribes as they advocate for the United States to uphold treaty and trust responsibilities. We applaud that in 2024, under the Biden-Harris Administration, the Prairie Band of Potawatomi Nation became the first federally recognized Tribal Nation in Illinois in 175 years, when the U.S. Department of the Interior placed 130 acres of the Shab-eh-nay reservation in nearby DeKalb County into trust.\n\nPreamble\n\nOur nation is at an inflection point. What kind of America will we be? A land of more freedom, or less freedom? More rights or fewer? An economy rigged for the rich and powerful, or where everyone has a fair shot at getting ahead? Will we lower the temperature in our politics and come together, or treat each other as enemies instead?\n\nThe stakes in this election are enormously high.\n\nPresident Biden and Vice President Harris took office during a time of global pandemic, record job loss, and record crime. These past four years, Democrats proved once again that democracy can deliver, and made tremendous progress turning the country around. President Biden and Vice President Harris turned a setback into a great American comeback for working families.\n\nWe've created nearly 16 million jobs, a record number of small businesses are being started, and factories are coming home. We lowered families' health insurance premiums, and we stood up to Big Pharma to lower prescription drug prices. We're helping students catch up on learning loss, and we're forgiving millions of crushing student loans. We passed the first significant gun safety law in decades and made record investments in public safety, putting more police officers on the beat; today, violent crime is at its lowest in 50 years. We're fighting climate change, reducing pollution, and fueling a clean energy boom. We're rebuilding our nation's roads, bridges, highways, ports, airports, water systems, and more. We're seizing record amounts of fentanyl and securing our border in the face of Republican inaction. We're closing the racial wealth gap and the gender pay gap. We've expanded benefits and services for toxic-exposed veterans; and we're strengthening NATO and restoring American leadership in the world.\n\nThere is so much more to do. Democrats will fix the tax system so everyone has a fair shot. We will restore the right to choose. We will continue to bring down costs for families. We will continue to reject political violence of all forms and give hate no safe harbor.\n\nDonald Trump has a very different vision \u2013 one focused not on opportunity and optimism, but on revenge and retribution; not on the American people, but on himself. He and his extreme MAGA allies are ripping away our bedrock personal freedoms, dictating what health care decisions women can make, banning books, and telling people who they can love. They're rigging our economy for their rich friends and big corporations, pushing more trickle-down tax cuts for the wealthy and powerful, and a new national sales tax that will cost every working family an average $2,500 a year. They'll cut the Social Security benefits that folks have paid into for their whole lives; and gut Medicare, Medicaid, health care, and prescription drug coverage. They are eroding our democracy with lies and threats, have refused to denounce political violence, and are making it harder to vote. And given the chance, they'll keep stacking our courts, locking in their extreme agenda for decades. We cannot let that happen.\n\nPresident Biden, Vice President Harris, and Democrats are running to finish the job. To grow our economy from the middle out and bottom up, not the top down. To reward work, not wealth. To lower costs. To tackle the climate crisis, lower energy costs, and secure energy independence. To protect communities and tackle the scourge of gun violence. To secure the border and fix the broken immigration system. To advance the President's Unity Agenda. To strengthen American leadership worldwide.\n\nHistory has shown that nothing about democracy is guaranteed. Every generation has to protect it, preserve it, choose it. We must stand together to choose what we want America to be.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nChapter One: Growing Our Economy from the Bottom Up & Middle Out 8\n\nEconomic Progress 8\n\nInvesting In America 9\n\nGood Jobs 10\n\nSmall Businesses 12\n\nAgriculture 13\n\nFighting Poverty 14\n\nEnding Special Interest Giveaways 15\n\nChapter Two: Rewarding Work, Not Wealth 16\n\nCutting Taxes For Working Families 17\n\nMaking The Wealthy & Big Corporations Pay Their Fair Share 17\n\nChapter Three: Lowering Costs 19\n\nHealth Care & Prescription Drugs 19\n\nChild Care, Home Care, & Paid Leave 22\n\nGas & Groceries 24\n\nCorporate Greed 24\n\nHousing 25\n\nEducation 28\n\nSocial Security, Pensions, & Medicare 30\n\nChapter Four: Tackling the Climate Crisis, Lowering Energy Costs, & Securing Energy Independence 32\n\nProducing Cleaner, More Affordable Energy 33\n\nLowering Energy Costs 33\n\nCreating Clean Energy Jobs 34\n\nReducing Pollution & Making Polluters Pay 35\n\nEnvironmental Justice 36\n\nBuilding Climate Resilient Communities 38\n\nConservation 38\n\nGlobal Climate Leadership 39\n\nChapter Five: Protecting Communities & Tackling the Scourge of Gun Violence 41\n\nGun Safety 41\n\nPolicing & Public Safety 42\n\nCriminal Justice 43\n\nViolence Against Women 45\n\nChapter Six: Strengthening Democracy, Protecting Freedoms, & Advancing Equity 47\n\nJudges 48\n\nVoting Rights 49\n\nStopping The Influence Of Special Interests 50\n\nReproductive Freedom 50\n\nWomen's Rights 52\n\nRacial Equity 54\n\nLgbtqi+ 58\n\nDisability 60\n\nTribal Nations 61\n\nCombating Hate & Protecting Freedom Of Religion 62\n\nFreedom Of The Press 64\n\nArts & Humanities 64\n\nD.C., Puerto Rico, Territories 65\n\nChapter Seven: Securing our Border & Fixing the Broken Immigration System 67\n\nSecuring The Border 68\n\nExpanding Legal Immigration & Deterring Illegal Immigration 70\n\nChapter Eight: Advancing the President's Unity Agenda 73\n\nBeating The Opioid Epidemic 73\n\nInvesting In Mental Health 74\n\nProtecting Kids Online, Strengthening Americans'\n\nData Privacy, & Promoting Competition 74\n\nEnding Cancer As We Know It 76\n\nMeeting Our Nation's Sacred Obligation To\n\nVeterans And Military Families 77\n\nChapter Nine: Strengthening American Leadership Worldwide 79\n\nEurope 79\n\nIndo-Pacific 81\n\nChina 82\n\nThe Middle East & North Africa 84\n\nWestern Hemisphere 87\n\nAfrica 88\n\nStrengthening The U.S. And Global Economy 89\n\nLeading With Diplomacy And American Values 90\n\nStrongest Military In The World 92\n\nChapter One: Growing Our Economy from the Bottom Up & Middle Out\n\nThis election is a choice between two very different economic visions for America: Donald Trump, who sees the world from his country club at Mar-a-Lago; and Joe Biden, who sees it from kitchen tables in Scranton like the one he grew up around. His economic agenda is about Main Street, not Wall Street. It's about ending the days of trickle-down economics and investing in America \u2013 in all Americans \u2013 and delivering for communities too long left behind.\n\nWhile Democrats keep fighting to lower costs for working families, Trump is rigging our economy for his Mar-a-Lago friends and billionaire donors, who like him, are only in it for themselves.\n\nAs president, Trump doubled down on the trickle-down policies of the past, cutting investment in infrastructure and education, and rewarding big corporations that ship jobs and profits overseas. He vowed to bring new factories to communities across America, but left nothing behind but a string of broken promises.\n\nDemocrats have a different record. We're delivering on President Biden's pledge to rebuild our economy from the middle out and bottom up, not the top down. We're investing in America \u2013 in our infrastructure, our industry, our people, and our future. While Trump left office with historic budget deficits and the worst jobs record since Herbert Hoover, since President Biden took office, this country has come back from the brink, the deficit has fallen by over $1 trillion, and we have the best jobs record since John F. Kennedy. We're powering the strongest economic recovery in the world.\n\nECONOMIC PROGRESS\n\nAt the start of the Biden-Harris Administration, in the midst of the worst economic crisis in 100 years, experts feared a stagnating recovery and even worried about a new recession. But Democrats chose to put workers first, and instead of recession, America has seen remarkable strength and resilience. Our economy grew by 3.1 percent last year \u2013 the fastest rate of any major economy in the world.\n\nWe've added nearly 16 million jobs \u2013 not only recovering all the positions lost during Trump's botched handling of COVID, but also adding 6.3 million more than existed before the pandemic \u2013 surpassing pre-pandemic projections for the labor market. During this Administration, 30 states from Mississippi to Pennsylvania have seen record-low unemployment; and the run of low unemployment nationwide hasn't been this long in over 50 years. Wages are up across the board, and rising fastest for lower-income workers, Black workers, Latinos, and women. Today's recovery is the fairest on record; in just four years, we've erased 40 percent of the wage inequality gap that took four decades to build. A record 18 million small business applications have been filed since President Biden took office, each one of them an act of hope.\n\nWhile too many families still feel the pain of inflation at the grocery store, or around the kitchen table when they sit down to pay their bills, we're making progress. Wages are rising faster than prices, and inflation today is down nearly two-thirds from its peak. We have to finish the job. Democrats will keep fighting to prevent the kind of supply chain shocks and corporate greed that have done so much to raise prices. And we'll keep investing in American workers, American jobs, and American families, bringing factories home to win the race for the future. Democrats know the story of the middle class isn't separate from the state of the economy \u2013 it's at its heart. And we'll never quit fighting to make sure that everyone is in on the deal.\n\nINVESTING IN AMERICA\n\nInfrastructure\n\nWe can't have the best economy in the world if we don't have the best infrastructure. And for generations, American infrastructure was the envy of the world. But over the years, we stopped investing in it, and we fell to thirteenth in infrastructure rankings. The Trump Administration declared it \"Infrastructure Week\" every week for four years, and never built a thing. But under President Biden, we're finally rebuilding our roads, bridges, ports, airports, water systems, electric grids, broadband, and more, paving the way for a great American \"Infrastructure Decade\" that will create hundreds of thousands of good-paying union jobs.\n\nThe Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is breaking ground on over 57,000 projects across 4,500 communities nationwide. We're rebuilding major roadways, from the Blatnik Bridge, a vital link between Wisconsin and Minnesota that carries more $4 billion in goods a year through the largest Great Lakes port; to a key stretch of the I-10 outside Phoenix that sees 126,000 vehicles a day. We're making the biggest investment in public transit in history, and at last building America's first true high-speed rail lines. We're replacing every toxic lead pipe in the country within a decade, so every child can turn on the faucet at home or at school and drink clean water without risking cancer or brain damage. We've added over 80,000 megawatts of new clean power capacity, the equivalent of building 40 Hoover Dams, to help shrink energy costs and meet ambitious climate goals. And we're bringing affordable, reliable, high-speed internet to every American household. High-speed internet is as vital to our economy today as electricity first was a century ago; Americans need it to do their jobs, to do their homework, to access health care, and to stay connected. But a full 45 million of us still live in areas where there is no high-speed internet. Democrats are closing that divide. These projects don't just build infrastructure, they create hundreds of thousands of good jobs for American workers.\n\nManufacturing\n\nDemocrats are also taking historic steps to bring home critical supply chains, and to reaffirm our nation's leadership in cutting-edge industries that America in fact often pioneered. After the pandemic exposed our reliance on foreign-made semiconductors, we passed the CHIPS and Science Act, to restore America's role producing the tiny computer chips needed to make everything from cell phones to dishwashers to cars. And as the climate crisis makes the shift to clean energy more urgent, we passed the Inflation Reduction Act, making the world's biggest investment ever in building renewable energy, electric vehicles, and other green technologies here at home.\n\nThe President's Investing in America agenda has incentivized a historic $877 billion in private funding across the United States to date. Companies are investing hundreds of billions more than under Trump to build new factories. In fact, under President Biden, more than a dozen states have seen the largest private sector investments in their history. We've designated more than 30 tech hubs in communities from Reno, Nevada; to Charlotte, North Carolina; to North Central Pennsylvania. And we've made sure that lower-income counties see a larger share of investment. Today, instead of exporting American jobs for cheaper labor, we're creating American jobs and exporting products, leaving no one behind.\n\nUnder President Biden, we've also boosted funding for the kind of research and development that can seed economy-transforming breakthroughs, like the internet. In recent years, America became one of the world's only major countries to pull back on R&D investments; Democrats are changing that. President Biden for example launched the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) in 2022, to find game-changing medical cures and treatments and transform important areas of medicine. Under his leadership, we'll continue supporting NASA and America's presence on the International Space Station, and working to send Americans back to the moon and to Mars. Democrats will keep America at the forefront of scientific discovery and innovation, responsibly leading the way in the defining fields of the future, like AI, biotech, quantum computing, advanced materials, and more.\n\nGOOD JOBS\n\nThese generational investments are transforming our economy, creating new businesses, new jobs, and new cycles of hope \u2013 in red states and blue states; in rural, urban, and Tribal Nation communities too long left behind. In all, President Biden's agenda has already created nearly 800,000 manufacturing jobs, and 880,000 more jobs in construction, building the roads, factories, and dreams of our future. More Americans are employed in these fields and clean energy today than ever were under Trump. President Biden's agenda requires that any federally-financed infrastructure job must include wage and labor protections. And we're making sure that these projects use American-made goods, by strengthening \"Buy American\" procurement rules to their toughest level in seven decades. That means every federally funded infrastructure project is being built with American-made steel, lumber, drywall, concrete, and other products, by American workers. And the Administration has taken historic steps to ensure that these workers are paid prevailing wages, with the free and fair choice to join a union; and to incentivize project labor agreements.\n\nPresident Biden believes that you shouldn't have to go to a four-year college to live a good, middle-class life. Democrats are working to make sure that every American can access these quality new jobs, where many people can earn over $100,000 a year. The American Rescue Plan supported more than 4,300 state- and local-government workforce development programs; while our Investing in American agenda is expanding job-training partnerships between high schools, community colleges, unions, and employers. We have a million trainees enrolled in registered apprenticeships today. Apprenticeships have long provided a reliable path to the middle class, empowering workers to earn while they learn, not only in traditional trades, but also in new cutting-edge industries. Extreme Republicans have proposed gutting funding for registered apprenticeships in this year's budget. We'll keep making historic investments in them to keep expanding opportunity, including by partnering directly with unions.\n\nDemocrats know that Wall Street didn't build America. The middle class built America \u2013 and unions built the middle class. President Biden and Vice President Harris are proud to lead the most pro-union Administration in history. President Biden named staunch labor allies and former union leaders to positions across the government, and empowered them to fight for good jobs and workers' rights. Biden is the first President to walk a picket line, joining UAW workers on strike in Detroit before they won historic wage increases last year. He knows that when unions win, all workers benefit; and as we rebuild our economy for the future, every worker needs a voice and a fair shot.\n\nDemocrats will keep fighting to pass the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, to give everyone the right to organize for better pay, benefits, and working conditions, and to hold abusive bosses accountable for violating workers' rights. We oppose state right-to-work laws, which drive down wages and leave workers unsafe; and we support penalizing employers who engage in union busting. We'll work to pass the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act, guaranteeing public sector bargaining rights; and to codify a right to organize for domestic workers, farm workers, and other unprotected laborers. Democrats will continue to create strong labor standards for jobs created with taxpayer dollars through legislation and with strong Buy American rules. Consistent with the law, we will ensure that federal grants and other assistance to employers are contingent on recipients committing to not interfering with workers' efforts to form a union. By leveraging the benefits of federal grants for infrastructure, manufacturing and services, we will seek to ensure that all Americans have the opportunity to participate in the American Dream.\n\nWe'll strengthen enforcement and penalties for safety, wage, and other labor and employment violations. And, Democrats will continue to aggressively hold companies accountable for violating child labor law. We've increased funding for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to protect workers on the job; and we'll continue to support workplace whistleblowers.\n\nAt the same time, we're pushing to guarantee workers the pay, benefits, and protections they deserve as well. We passed the Butch Lewis Act, keeping over 2 million people's hard-earned pensions solvent. We also raised the minimum wage for federal contractors to $17.20 an hour, and will keep pushing Congress to increase it to at least $15 for all Americans. We're making millions more hourly workers eligible for overtime pay; and we've cracked down on wage theft and exploitation, recovering over $750 million for low-wage workers wrongly denied pay. We're making it harder for employers to misclassify workers as independent contractors to avoid paying them full pay and benefits. We're banning most non-compete agreements, freeing workers to move between jobs and negotiate. And we've restricted mandatory arbitration, so fewer employers can silence wronged employees in a workplace dispute.\n\nWe also recognize that the U.S. Postal Service is the world's most efficient, and Democrats are wholly committed to supporting a public U.S.P.S. We will fight all efforts to privatize it and will work to ensure that it's financially sustainable. We will protect its universal service obligation and on-time delivery. And we will support a Board of Governors and a Postal Regulatory Commission that champion a strong public Postal Service.\n\nTrump has a very different record. As President, he not only failed to bring manufacturing jobs home, he pushed to cut funding for R&D and job training. He gave tax breaks to big corporations, with no condition that they invest in workers or innovation in return. He stacked his Labor Department and National Labor Relations Board with corporate lawyers who made it harder to organize, not easier. His Administration ripped protections from federal workers, slashed workplace safety inspections, and blocked increases in overtime pay. Now, Trump and his allies are vowing to repeal key pieces of the Biden agenda \u2013 stalling historic progress; undermining American manufacturing; and costing hundreds of thousands of Americans the good paychecks and future prospects that they deserve.\n\nDemocrats won't let that happen. We fought hard to pass the most significant investments in America in generations. Now, we'll continue the important work of implementing them, to be sure that the benefits are shared in every corner of America and create good-paying jobs that folks can raise a family on, with the chance to join a union, and that rely on materials made here at home. We cannot go backwards. We have to own these industries and jobs of the future.\n\nSMALL BUSINESSES\n\nSmall businesses are the engine of America's economy and the glue of our communities. They employ nearly half of all private sector workers, and drive half of all economic activity. They embody the vision and grit that literally built this country.\n\nWhen President Biden took office, our economy was reeling and millions of small businesses were hanging by a thread. Business owners faced the prospect of losing not just their livelihoods, but their dreams, their life's savings, and their hopes of leaving something behind for their kids. So Democrats moved fast. Within weeks, we reformed the Paycheck Protection Program, getting game-changing help to thousands of America's smallest businesses, which had been shut out by Trump. Then, we passed the American Rescue Plan and helped 6 million small businesses pay their bills and workers and stay afloat. And thanks to that legislation, we provided additional support to 100,000 restaurants and 220,000 child care centers serving millions of kids, which working parents rely on. Not a single Republican voted for it.\n\nSince then, Democrats have passed other historic laws, to build infrastructure, semiconductors, clean energy, and the small-business supply chains that support those cutting-edge industries, here at home. The Administration is expanding access to capital, business opportunities, and training to help those small businesses; while working for a fairer tax code, to level the playing field for small entrepreneurs who have to compete against corporate giants. The Administration has invested a record $12 billion in Community Development Finance Institutions (CDFIs), to support small businesses and growth across low-income communities. The Small Business Administration is nearly halfway to its goal of providing $250 billion in financing to 500,000 small businesses by 2030. For example, to get mom-and-pop businesses the small loans, under $150,000, that are often hard to secure, the SBA has brought in additional non-traditional lenders that specialize in working with underserved small businesses. It's now on track to double these loans by year's end, compared to 2020. The Administration is also directing billions of dollars to community lenders and state-level small-business programs. Along with initiatives like Vice President Harris's Economic Opportunity Coalition, it is mobilizing hundreds of billions more in private investment. At the same time, the federal government this year set a record for small business contract spending, awarding them 28 percent of total procurement dollars, directly supporting a million jobs. It is on track to meet its goal of increasing federal contracts awarded to small disadvantaged businesses by 50 percent.\n\nAs a result, America is today in the midst of a historic small-business boom. A record 18 million new business applications have been filed since Joe Biden became president \u2013 the three strongest years of new business growth in history, and over 90 percent faster than pre-pandemic averages. Since the pandemic, the share of Black households owning a business has more than doubled, Latino business ownership is up 40 percent, and women own a record share of businesses. As President Biden often says, each new business formed is an act of hope.\n\nThanks to President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Minority Business Development Agency is now a permanent part of the Commerce Department, where it's training underserved entrepreneurs. The SBA's innovative Community Navigators program meanwhile helped 350,000 small businesses tap into resources that have helped them grow. In a second Biden term, we'll make that Navigator program permanent, and include new lenders, new markets, and fairer taxes.\n\nTrump still puts Wall Street before Main Street. As president, he slashed the tax rate for giant corporations, but left small businesses behind. His disastrous response to COVID funneled assistance to well-connected friends and companies, but left too many of our smallest businesses without essential help. More than 300,000 closed. He's now running on a plan to double-down on his tax scam to benefit big corporations and billionaires. His Congressional allies keep trying to slash SBA funding, and to repeal our investments in infrastructure and manufacturing \u2013 the same ones that are lowering costs for small businesses, boosting their revenue, and helping millions to thrive. Democrats won't let that happen.\n\nAGRICULTURE\n\nAmerican farmers are the backbone of our country. They feed America, and help feed the world. But over the years, trickle-down economics has hit rural America hard. Farming costs have gone up and incomes have gone down. Big Agriculture moved in, telling too many small farms that the surest path to success was to get big or get out. As a result, we lost over 400,000 farms in America in the last 40 years, and rural communities have paid a steep price. Too many young people have had to leave their hometowns to find good-paying work and a shot at their dreams.\n\nThe President believes that no one should have to leave the community where they grew up just to find opportunity. His Investing in America agenda is investing in all of America, including farms and rural areas. It's creating new sources of income for farmers and increasing competition among suppliers, to both lower the cost of farm inputs and to get small and mid-size farmers a larger share of profits. The Inflation Reduction Act is helping farmers and ranchers adopt climate-smart practices, which make the land more resilient and increase profitability, while connecting them to new markets and premiums for sustainably produced commodities. The Administration recognizes the critical role that our land stewards play in our food systems, economy, and environment, and is working hard to drive both public and private funds to reward these champions for nature for their hard work. The Administration has also supported independent meat and poultry processing, reducing producers' reliance on big companies to buy their product; and it's working to make livestock and poultry markets fairer and more transparent. Today, family farms have more income from more varied sources, so their children have more opportunity to stay family farmers.\n\nAt the same time, the Administration is helping family farmers service distressed loans in order to keep their lands and ultimately pass them down to their kids. It has worked with many farmers to boost the production of expensive fertilizer, increasing supply and easing costs for everyone else. The U.S.D.A. also expanded farm insurance to allow for more double cropping, a practice that increases farm earnings, expands the food supply, and helps lower average food prices for American families. Going forward, Democrats will also work to get farmers the right to repair their own equipment, without having to pay big equipment makers for diagnostic tools and repairs. And we will look to further limit foreign ownership of U.S. farmland to protect our food supply and national security.\n\nThroughout, Democrats have stood by farm workers. We are working to improve workers' safety at meat processing facilities, and we will continue to enforce and advance labor and environmental rules, for example promoting organizing rights and requiring overtime pay, and boosting protections against harmful pesticides and extreme heat.\n\nFIGHTING POVERTY\n\nAs Democrats, we believe in an America where people look out for one another and leave no one behind. But we know we still have a long way to go to make America's promise real for everyone. Some 40 million Americans still live in poverty. The pandemic made things worse, hitting the poor hardest, and pushing millions more families to the brink. The American Rescue Plan drove poverty to record lows in 2021. It expanded the Child Tax Credit and made it available to all low-income children for the first time, helping to slash child poverty by nearly half. It tripled the maximum Earned Income Tax Credit for millions of low-income workers, so their taxes wouldn't push them deeper into poverty. It kept 8 million families in their homes, child care centers open, and small businesses on their feet. It increased Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, helping tens of millions of Americans keep food on the table. Not a single Republican voted for the bill.\n\nAnd the Administration has done more. It reversed a Trump-era policy that would have risked putting half-a-million children in poverty. It modernized SNAP benefits for the first time since 1975, permanently increasing them and lifting more than 2 million people, including over a million children, out of poverty as well. President Biden signed into law a permanent special summer nutrition program that will help 21 million kids. And he successfully blocked Congressional Republican proposals that would've increased poverty by slashing health care, housing, food assistance, and more.\n\nNow, it's time to finish the job. Democrats know that most folks fundamentally want the same things \u2013 not a hand out, but a fair shot. That's why we'll keep pushing to restore the expanded Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit, which proved so effective at reducing poverty before Republicans let them expire. We'll work to finally raise the federal minimum wage to at least $15-an-hour. We'll fight for paid leave, better health care, and more investment in public schools and affordable housing. We'll reduce the need for foster care, by supporting families and engaging kin. We'll further expand public transit, connecting communities that have been cut off for too long. We'll keep working to get more low-income families access to affordable banking as well, and to boost the supply of capital and loans by investing more in CDFIs. We'll also push to make the New Markets Tax Credit permanent, drawing new investment to low-income communities nationwide. And we'll continue to reject Republican proposals to increase poverty by making devastating cuts to programs that vulnerable Americans count on.\n\nIn the wealthiest nation on earth, we all benefit when we help one another. Democrats will keep working to build an economy that rewards work, not wealth; where we care for the most vulnerable, and unleash the potential that all our children have to grow and thrive. We remain committed to fighting poverty and enabling all Americans to live up to their God-given potential.\n\nENDING SPECIAL INTEREST GIVEAWAYS\n\nTo invest in the American people and reduce the deficit, Democrats are also ending giveaways to big corporations and special interests that have benefitted at the expense of American taxpayers for too long.\n\nWe're seizing a tremendous opportunity for savings on prescription drugs and insurance. The Administration has already cracked down on one of Big Pharma's biggest scams, by finally giving Medicare, the single biggest buyer of drugs in America, the ability to negotiate lower prescription drug prices, as the VA and private insurers have done for years. The Administration is also requiring drugmakers to reimburse Medicare if they hike prices faster than inflation. That kind of markup pads Big Pharma profits, wasting taxpayer dollars. Democrats will expand the number of drugs subject to price caps and negotiation under the Inflation Reduction Act, saving taxpayers nearly $160 billion over the next 10 years, as Medicare will no longer have to pay Big Pharma exorbitant prices.\n\nAt the same time, we'll keep pushing to crack down on outsize insurance company profits, for example by requiring health insurers to reimburse Medicaid if they bill more than they actually spend on patient care. We also believe in saving taxpayers money by investing more in preventative health care, vaccines, and other treatment for Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries, avoiding unnecessary medical costs by keeping folks healthy \u2013 investing in America, and in the American people.\n\nChapter Two: Rewarding Work, Not Wealth\n\nTo any American with the ingenuity and drive to make a million bucks, President Biden says, great. Just pay your fair share in taxes. A hedge fund manager or CEO should never pay a lower tax rate than a teacher or firefighter. A company with billions of dollars in profits should not pay $0 in taxes.\n\nA fair tax code is how we invest in the things that make our nation strong, like health care, education, a clean environment, and the national defense. It's how we protect programs that Americans rely on, like Social Security and Medicare. It's how we build a powerful economy, reduce fiscal risks, and lead the world.\n\nDonald Trump is focused on rigging the game for his billionaire donors instead. He always puts himself and his rich friends first. In 2017, he enacted a reckless, unpaid-for tax cut that overwhelmingly benefited the very wealthy and biggest corporations. It was full of outrageous giveaways, including a massive tax break for the wealthiest 0.1 percent. It slashed the corporate tax rate by nearly half, with executives plowing their windfalls into stock buybacks for their own benefit, rather than investing in workers or better products, or lowering prices. After weakening labor protections and complaining that wages are \"too high,\" Trump is now telling donors behind closed doors at Mar-a-Lago: \"You're rich as hell, and we're going to give you tax cuts.\"\n\nThat trickle-down approach never worked. Trump's allies predicted that his tax scam would push economic growth as high as 6 percent, but America's growth rate barely changed. The law had no impact on the average American's income \u2013 only boosting wages for those in the top 10 percent. Trump's allies claimed it would pay for itself, but it instead exploded the federal deficit by $2 trillion. Trump's policies added more to our national debt than has ever been added in a presidential term.\n\nCorporate profits have doubled since the pandemic, yet Trump wants to reward corporations with another big tax cut. Republicans are doubling down on Trump's failed approach and have proposed $1 trillion in new corporate tax cuts. They'll repeal the estate tax, so the wealthiest 0.1 percent of Americans can pass wealth on to their heirs tax-free. They'll give American billionaires an average $3.5 million tax break \u2013 a giveaway nearly 50 times bigger than what the average family earns in a year. House Republicans have vowed to pay for part of all that by cutting Social Security and Medicare for everyone else. Economists say Trump's billionaire giveaways and extreme tariffs will slow growth, cost jobs, and trigger a recession his first year back in office, raising taxes on middle-class families by $2,500 a year, and adding trillions to the deficit.\n\nDemocrats have a different view. We don't believe we should add $5 trillion to the national debt to give more tax breaks skewed to the wealthy and big corporations. We're fighting to reward work, not wealth \u2013 to cut costs and make the tax code fairer for the middle class, while making the wealthy and big corporations finally pay their fair share. Under President Biden's plan, no American earning less than $400,000 a year will pay one single penny more in federal taxes, period. We're working to end special interest giveaways, and to make sure all Americans play by the same rules. And instead of exploding the national deficit, our plan cuts it by $3 trillion over the next decade, delivering real results for the American people in a fiscally responsible way.\n\nCUTTING TAXES FOR WORKING FAMILIES\n\nDemocrats will protect everyone earning less than $400,000 a year from any tax increase; and we will fight to protect and expand other tax benefits for working people and families with children.\n\nDuring the pandemic, Democrats expanded the Child Tax Credit, saving nearly 40 million families with 65 million children up to $3,600 per child per year, and cutting child poverty nearly in half to its lowest rate on record. We expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit as well, saving over 17 million low-paid workers an average $700 a year. And, we expanded the health insurance premium tax credit, saving millions of families who buy coverage on an Affordable Care Act exchange about $800 a year.\n\nRepublicans are opposed to this tax relief for families that need it. They already blocked renewal of our Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit expansions, pushing 3 million children back into poverty. Republicans also keep trying to repeal our premium tax credit expansions, which will raise health care costs for millions of families. Democrats will keep fighting to restore and protect that tax relief, giving tens of millions of families some breathing room again. And President Biden has also proposed a $10,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers and people selling their first homes, to help reduce housing costs for working families.\n\nThe Treasury Department and the IRS are also making it easier and cheaper for Americans to file their taxes and collect the refunds they're owed. The IRS successfully piloted a free, easy-to-use online tool, Direct File, which has already saved taxpayers millions of dollars in filing fees. It has since announced that Direct File will be a permanent offering, saving users an average $150 in filing costs \u2013 but Republicans keep trying to defund this free tool.\n\nMAKING THE WEALTHY & BIG CORPORATIONS PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE\n\nPresident Biden's plans will cut taxes for middle-class and low-income Americans \u2013 and we'll finance those cuts by making the ultra-wealthy and big corporations finally start paying their fair share.\n\nThere are a thousand billionaires in America, and they pay an average 8 percent in taxes \u2013 a far lower rate than a firefighter or teacher. Democrats will make billionaires pay a minimum income tax rate of 25 percent, raising $500 billion in 10 years. We'll end the preferential treatment for capital gains for millionaires, so they pay the same rate on investment income as on wages.\n\nWe'll put an end to abusive life insurance tax shelters, and stop billionaires from exploiting retirement tax incentives that are supposed to help middle-class families save. We'll eliminate the \"stepped-up basis\" loophole for the wealthiest Americans, so they can't avoid paying taxes on their wealth by passing it down to heirs. Democrats will close the \"carried interest\" loophole, which wealthy fund managers have long used to halve tax rates on their own personal pay, so they pay a lower rate than some teachers or firefighters do. That's wrong. And, we'll increase our new stock buyback tax to 4 percent to discourage stock buybacks that benefit executives and wealthy shareholders, instead of workers and consumers.\n\nWe will also keep upping the pressure on wealthy and corporate tax cheats that fail to pay what they owe. The IRS was severely underfunded for years; but Democrats are improving IRS services for everyday taxpayers and reviving enforcement against wealthy and corporate tax cheats, raising more than an estimated $440 billion in additional revenue as a result. The IRS has already collected over $500 million in unpaid taxes from less than 2,000 delinquent millionaires, and launched efforts aimed at thousands of other millionaires who hadn't filed a return in years. Democrats will protect this progress by continuing to invest in modernizing the IRS. Republicans are working to reverse it, protecting wealthy tax cheats and increasing the deficit instead.\n\nDemocrats will also make billion-dollar companies pay their fair share. In 2020, 55 of the biggest companies in America made $40 billion in profit, but paid zero in federal income taxes.\n\nCorporations are seeing record margins, but their share of federal taxes has fallen below 10 percent, down from 30 percent in the 1950s. It's wrong. Trump doesn't care: he slashed the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, down from 35 percent. President Biden will raise that rate back to 28 percent. And for those billion-dollar tax dodgers, the President signed a historic 15 percent corporate minimum tax into law. He also reached a global minimum tax agreement with 140 countries, so that big multinational companies will no longer be able to pit nations against one another in a race to the bottom. And, Biden will double the tax rate that American multinationals pay on foreign earnings to 21 percent; and end incentives, introduced by Trump, that encourage companies to shift jobs and operations overseas and book profits in low-tax countries.\n\nDemocrats oppose unfair loopholes and wasteful subsidies that benefit special interests at everyone else's expense. We will fight to get rid of them. That starts by eliminating tens of billions of dollars in subsidies for oil and gas companies. It means ending special tax breaks for corporate jets, and boosting fuel taxes on corporate and private jet travel, saving taxpayers $4 billion over 10 years. And we'll no longer permit companies to deduct the cost of paying executives more than $1 million a year. Corporations shouldn't get a tax break for giving huge pay packages to CEOs.\n\nWe'll also eliminate the so-called \"like-kind exchange\" loophole that allows wealthy real estate investors to avoid paying taxes on real estate profits, as long as they keep investing in real estate \u2013 a tax break that Trump protected for himself and other corporate landlords in his 2017 tax scam. No other industry has that kind of sweetheart deal; it ends now.\n\nChapter Three: Lowering Costs\n\nToday, our economy is growing, wages are rising, and a record number of Americans have good jobs. But for too many hard-working families, the cost of living is too high. Lowering costs is Democrats' number one economic priority. We're using every tool to bring prices down on health insurance and prescription drugs, including negotiating the price of commonly used drugs for diabetes and heart failure; and on housing, child care, internet, banking, credit cards, and more. We have more to do, but our actions are already putting thousands of dollars a year back in people's pockets. Those savings add up, and Democrats will keep fighting until every American feels them.\n\nWhen the pandemic disrupted supply chains, everyday items became hard to get, raising prices. When Russia invaded Ukraine, food and gas prices spiked more. As companies' costs went up, they raised prices, too. President Biden worked across industries to ease supply bottlenecks and get goods and energy flowing again. He delivered, and inflation has since dropped two-thirds from its peak.\n\nBut some companies haven't passed those new savings on to consumers. Their costs have come down, but they've kept prices high anyway, boosting profits. Corporate profits have more than doubled since 2017. Last year, after-tax profit ratios for corporations outside the financial sector were their highest in 90 years.\n\nPresident Biden's lowering costs agenda is historic in scope, attacking the issue from every angle to help cut costs for consumers, crack down on price gouging, and get companies to use their record profits to reduce prices long-term. It's also investing in making things in America again to boost supply, push down prices, and bring jobs home.\n\nDonald Trump hasn't offered a single solution to lower families' costs. He wants to drag America backwards, with extreme import tariffs that will make life more expensive for folks nationwide. And for corporations that hiked prices and doubled profits since the pandemic, Trump wants to reward them with a massive tax cut. Independent analysts say his MAGA tax and tariff plans will increase inflation, cost 3 million American jobs, and slow growth, triggering a recession in his first year back in office. Trump's plan will increase costs for working families by $2,500 a year.\n\nToday, America has built its way back into the strongest economic recovery in the world. Democrats won't let Trump throw that all away.\n\nHEALTH CARE & PRESCRIPTION DRUGS\n\nHealth Care\n\nHealth care should be a right in America, not a privilege. Every American deserves the peace of mind that quality, affordable coverage brings. That's why Democrats fought so hard to pass the Affordable Care Act, providing 45 million Americans with insurance, guaranteeing protections for 100 million people with preexisting conditions, and protecting nearly 180 million people from lifetime coverage limits. Yet even now, 14 years after we passed that landmark law, Trump and Republicans are still threatening to repeal it. Democrats will never let that happen. We'll never quit fighting to protect and expand the Affordable Care Act, making quality care more accessible and affordable, as the Biden-Harris Administration has done.\n\nToday, more Americans have health insurance than ever in history. Coverage is up and costs are down. A record 21 million people signed up through the Affordable Care Act this year, helping to slash the uninsured rate from 16 percent in 2010 to under 8 percent now. Democrats have expanded the health insurance premium tax credit twice, saving millions of Americans an average of $800 a year on coverage; and helping an additional 1.7 million Latinos, 830,000 Black Americans, and 110,000 Asian Americans buy more affordable insurance. Republicans want to let those credits expire, increasing premiums. Democrats will fight to make them permanent.\n\nAs Democrats, we support Medicaid expansion, encouraging states to provide health coverage to low-income Americans on the federal government's tab. The Administration has helped over a million people in four states to enroll; and we'll keep pushing Congress to further expand Medicaid-like coverage to the 2.8 million uninsured low-income adults who live in states where Republicans still refuse the help.\n\nDemocrats are working to protect kids' health coverage as well, by removing financial barriers for the Children's Health Insurance Program; and making it easier for families to keep kids on Medicaid. President Biden's plan will let families go three years without having to resubmit Medicaid paperwork for children younger than six, reducing burdensome red tape.\n\nDemocrats believe that quality, affordable health care should be available in every corner of America. The Administration has invested in new mobile health clinics; and in keeping community and rural health centers, lifelines for tens of millions of people, open, well-staffed, and well-equipped. We want to double those investments now. And the Administration is cracking down on federally funded health care providers that turn away or otherwise discriminate against people on the basis of race, sex, age, national origin, or disability.\n\nDemocrats will keep working to grow the health care workforce, so workplace and other provider shortages no longer create barriers to quality care and inflate health care costs. We are investing in programs that train primary care practitioners, registered nurses, mental health specialists, and others to work across our health care system, including in rural and low-income areas.\n\nThe Administration is also cracking down on surprise medical billing and junk health insurance, so patients are no longer ambushed by unexpected bills or scammed into buying low-quality health coverage. Democrats will expand \"no-surprise billing\" to include costly ground ambulances; and we'll keep using antitrust laws to stop hospital, insurance, and Big Pharma mergers that undermine competition and increase health care prices for consumers.\n\nAt the same time, Democrats will keep fighting to ease the burden of medical debt, which makes it harder for millions of Americans to get a mortgage or other loan for the future. Democrats provided funding to forgive $7 billion in medical debt for nearly 3 million Americans; and the Administration is urging states to use remaining funds to do more. It already persuaded credit reporting agencies to exclude many medical debts from credit reports, boosting people's credit scores and prospects for the future. In all, these actions have reduced the total number of Americans with listed medical debt from 46 million in 2020 to 15 million. Democrats will keep pushing to exclude medical debts from credit scoring entirely.\n\nDemocrats also support the Administration's historic work to close fundamental gaps in women's health care, including by protecting access to reproductive health care. This includes its efforts to reduce maternal mortality, led by Vice President Harris. She called for states to provide a full year of postpartum coverage for Medicaid beneficiaries, with 46 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands now taking that step. The Administration is also making transformative investments in women's health research to find better ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat health conditions in women, and to make care more accessible and affordable. And it is leading game-changing work to end cancer as we know it, including through the creation of the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H).\n\nTrump has no plan to reduce health care costs for Americans. He and his MAGA allies have spent years working to repeal the Affordable Care Act, trying and failing over 50 times. Now, Trump is once again promising to \"terminate\" the landmark law, gutting coverage for the 45 million Americans who rely on it for care. Doing so will cost families $13,000 a year, and threaten protections for 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions. It will strip 150 million people of preventative care like cancer screenings, and reduce access to mental health and substance use treatment. A Republican repeal will also deny life-changing home care to millions of seniors and people with disabilities, and kick young adults up to age 26 off their parents' insurance plans. And, it'll push more of the 500-plus rural hospitals that are already at risk of closing to shut down.\n\nPrescription Drugs\n\nBig Pharma has ripped off Americans for years, charging two and three times more here than in other countries for the exact same medications. Nearly three in ten Americans can't afford their prescriptions as a result. Instead of working to change that, Trump gave drugmakers massive tax breaks that only incentivized them to shift production overseas.\n\nPresident Biden, Vice President Harris, and Democrats took on Big Pharma and won. Democrats capped the price of insulin at $35 a month, down from as much as $400, for nearly 4 million seniors on Medicare. And President Biden persuaded the nation's top three insulin makers to lower their prices for everyone. Now, we'll fight to expand that $35 cap to cover everyone, saving millions of Americans with diabetes nearly $1,000 a year. Starting next year, the Inflation Reduction Act also caps total out-of-pocket drug costs at $2,000 a year for millions of seniors and others on Medicare. Democrats will fight until that cap covers every single American.\n\nFor the first time, Medicare now also has the ability to negotiate lower drug prices, as private insurers and the VA have done for decades. It started doing so this year, beginning with 10 commonly used medications for conditions such as diabetes and heart failure. Democrats will push to add at least 50 drugs a year to that list, lowering prices for 500 drugs this decade. Medicare Part-D is also working to cap cost-sharing for life-saving generics at $2 a dose; Democrats will make this mandatory for all Medicare beneficiaries.\n\nThe Administration is also leading the charge against Big Pharma price gouging, by requiring drugmakers that raise prices faster than inflation to pay the difference back to Medicare, which will then pass savings on to consumers. This will protect over 750,000 seniors, who could save as much as $4,500 per over-priced dose. Democrats will keep fighting to expand these rebates, applying them when drugmakers overcharge not just Medicare, but private insurers as well. We're also cracking down on improper drug patent listings, which some drugmakers use to shut out competition. Once companies drop their improper patent listings, other companies will be free to make cheaper alternatives. The FTC's work in this area has already pushed three of the biggest makers of inhalers to lower prices to $35 a month, saving people with asthma hundreds of dollars a year. The Administration also enacted rules to finally make hearing aids available over-the-counter, saving millions of Americans up to $3,000 a pair. And Democrats will continue the Administration's work to require that any drugs developed with taxpayer dollars be available to taxpayers, including at reasonable prices. Democrats will keep working to lower drug prices by requiring more transparency from the \"pharmacy benefit manager\" middlemen who generally decide which drugs are covered by insurance and bought by doctors, and how much they cost.\n\nAll these actions will benefit family budgets. And they'll boost the federal budget, too \u2013 reducing the deficit by $160 billion over the next ten years, as Medicare no longer has to pay Big Pharma exorbitant prices.\n\nEvery Democrat in Congress voted for the Inflation Reduction Act, the historic law behind these savings. Every single Republican voted against it \u2013 against $35 insulin for seniors, against Medicare negotiating lower prices, against saving millions of seniors' money on life-saving drugs. Now, Trump and his MAGA allies are promising to repeal it entirely, and to funnel our savings back into Big Pharma's pockets. We won't let that happen.\n\nCHILD CARE, HOME CARE, & PAID LEAVE\n\nChild & Home Care\n\nThe United States can't have the best economy in the world without strong support for caregiving. But today, the cost of care is too high, pay for care workers is too low, and families are caught in the middle of a broken system. Democrats understand that fixing the caregiving crisis cannot wait.\n\nDuring the pandemic, Democrats' American Rescue Plan kept 220,000 child care centers open, getting parents back to work and saving families an average $1,250 a year per child. It preserved a million care workers' jobs, and increased their pay by 10 percent. It expanded support for home- and community-based services for seniors and people with disabilities.\n\nAnd not a single Republican voted for it.\n\nLast year, President Biden issued a historic executive order directing agencies to further expand access to affordable care. The Administration also capped child care costs for 100,000 low-income families at 7 percent of their income, saving each an average $2,400 a year. Overall, the Administration increased federal child care funding by 50 percent.\n\nDemocrats will make investments like these permanent, and guarantee affordable, quality child care to millions of working families for less than $10-a-day per child. And we'll restore the expanded Child Tax Credit and strengthen Head Start. For seniors and people with disabilities, Democrats will improve and expand home- and community-based services, working toward finally eliminating the 700,000-person Medicaid waiting list, so more people can live and work with dignity in their own communities. We'll also keep pushing to improve pay and benefits for care workers, for example by fighting to get many of them a bigger share of Medicaid home care payments. Democrats will overhaul the quality of care and quality of life for our nation's 1.3 million nursing home residents by defending Administration regulations that require minimum staffing standards at nursing homes.\n\nDemocrats are the only party with a plan to expand access to care, and to make it more affordable and accessible for all. Trump and his MAGA allies in Congress have voted repeatedly to increase the cost of care, for example by slashing Head Start and child care programs, eliminating slots for half a million kids. Trump has no plan to lower child care or home care costs for American families. Instead, House Republicans have promised to slash Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program, while their continued efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act will strip millions of seniors and people with disabilities of life-changing home support.\n\nPaid Leave\n\nAmerica is the world's only advanced economy not to guarantee paid leave. The vast majority of employers don't offer it \u2013 nearly three-quarters of private-sector employees don't have paid family leave through their jobs, including 94 percent of America's lowest-paid workers. The pandemic only made the economic consequences of this failure more devastating. In the United States of America, no one should have to choose between caring for a parent who raised them, a child who depends on them, and the paycheck that they need to survive.\n\nTrump and Republicans failed to guarantee any new paid leave to private sector workers. Instead, their various proposals included unfunded mandates on states, tax credits that failed to expand access but subsidized large businesses, and schemes to force new parents seeking paid leave to borrow against their own future Social Security funds.\n\nFrom Day One, President Biden has pushed to do more. He fought to include a comprehensive paid leave program in legislation that ultimately became the Inflation Reduction Act. He instructed federal agencies to expand access to paid and unpaid leave for federal employees. He expanded the Military Parental Leave Program, so all active-duty, new-parent servicemembers can take 12 weeks. And his budget includes the strongest paid leave proposals in history, permanently funding the national paid leave plan that America needs.\n\nThat plan will create America's first, full, national paid family and medical leave program, guaranteeing every American worker up to 12 weeks of paid time off to care for a new child or loved one to recover from an illness, in cases of domestic violence, or military deployment. It will help families care for one another, and it will help businesses retain valuable talent and small businesses to compete. Millions more parents will be able to work, and it will add hundreds of billions to our economy. Democrats have pushed for this for decades. It's past time that America caught up with the rest of the world.\n\nGAS & GROCERIES\n\nWhen the pandemic crushed supply chains, prices for everyday items, from food to gas to airfare, went up. But after supply bottlenecks eased, many companies didn't lower prices in line with their falling costs. President Biden will keep calling those companies out for price gouging, and hold them accountable when they don't pass savings on to consumers.\n\nTo lower prices, Democrats will also keep working to boost supply, fix supply chains and promote competition, especially for essential items like gas and groceries that families depend on.\n\nThrough record energy production of clean energy, oil, and gas, we've lowered prices at the pump for American families. The Administration also released nearly 200 million barrels of gasoline from the Strategic Petroleum and Northeast Gasoline Supply reserves; and it is lowering gas prices by up to 25 cents per gallon more in certain markets, particularly in the Midwest, by making cheaper, E15 ethanol-blended gasoline available each summer. And, the Administration is cracking down to prevent collusion by oil companies that could raise prices more.\n\nThe President also knows the frustration and fear that high grocery prices can cause, and he has taken action to lower costs for hard-working families. He and his team have met repeatedly with grocery CEOs and business leaders, who agreed this spring to lower prices. The Administration is also cracking down on price gouging and promoting competition in agriculture, making everything from fertilizer to poultry processing more affordable for farmers. The President also signed into law the bipartisan Ocean Shipping Reform Act, which lowers shipping prices and helps American farmers export their goods.\n\nTrump and his MAGA allies fought these changes all the way, siding with Big Oil and special interests over working families. Instead of standing up to them, Trump just wants to give them another massive tax cut.\n\nCORPORATE GREED\n\nToday, corporate consolidation is allowing companies to keep raking in historic profits, while continuing to raise prices for working families. In the two decades before President Biden came to office, three-quarters of American industries grew more concentrated. As the President often says, capitalism without competition isn't capitalism, it's exploitation. And the American people are tired of being played for suckers.\n\nThe Administration has taken historic steps to boost competition across our economy, in fields from finance and farming to technology and transportation. We're banning non-compete agreements so that workers have the freedom to pursue a new job or start a new business. We're protecting consumers from unfair hidden \"junk fees\" and price gouging, and shoring up our banking system to keep people's hard-earned savings safe.\n\nDuring his first months in office, the President launched a Competition Council tasked with coordinating and advancing this work. Agencies have taken dozens of actions to increase competition across markets and industries \u2013 from making hearing aids available over the counter, to reducing cargo and rail shipping costs for goods, to support efforts to allow farmers and other Americans to repair their own equipment. The Justice Department and the FTC have increased antitrust enforcement, releasing updated merger guidelines, and halting a slate of big mergers in the airline, food, and defense sectors that would've increased consumer prices.\n\nDemocrats will keep working to make the American economy more competitive for businesses and workers across sectors, from transportation to housing to food. And we will reform hiring and procurement processes across the government, to boost competition among our contractors and suppliers, too.\n\nThe Administration is also taking broad action to crack down on \"junk fees,\" the hidden charges that companies add on to people's bills without their knowledge, reducing consumer choice. We've already taken action to crack down on a range of these junk fees charged by airlines, internet providers, hotels, and apartment buildings. We've pushed banks to slash unfair overdraft and bounced check charges and took action to cap credit card late fees. We're cracking down on junk health insurance plans that advertise one rate, but then stick patients with a much bigger medical bill. Over time, these combined actions will save American families hundreds and even thousands of dollars a year \u2013 adding up to more than $20 billion a year across the economy \u2013 giving people a little more breathing room. And we'll keep pushing until we ban all junk fees across our economy.\n\nDemocrats are also working to shore up a safe, secure banking system that protects consumer deposits and holds investors accountable. Democrats have pushed for legislation to hold executives at all failed banks accountable, clawing back compensation and banning them from the industry. We're working to limit out-of-control Wall Street bonuses that encourage risky bank practices that jeopardize our whole economy. And we'll keep pushing to pass an updated Glass-Steagall Act, more clearly separating commercial and investment banking and expanding Volcker rule safeguards. We defeated Republican efforts to gut the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau at the Supreme Court this year; we'll continue to protect and strengthen that agency and support its critical work.\n\nHOUSING\n\nA home is more than a roof over your head, it's a place to raise your family, to build community, and to grow the American Dream. It's also the biggest investment, and the biggest monthly expense, that most people ever face. Some 15 years after the subprime mortgage crisis devastated homeowners and froze construction nationwide, we're still seeing the effect of a severe housing shortage that's pushing up prices and keeping homes out of reach.\n\nPresident Biden has taken historic steps to help Americans rent, buy, and build. In the depth of the pandemic, the American Rescue Plan kept 8 million families in their homes nationwide by preventing foreclosures and evictions. Since then, the Administration has eased rising rents by capping rent hikes in 2 million federally-funded apartments. It led the biggest expansion of rental assistance for low-income families in 20 years. It's cracking down on slumlords who don't play by the rules. The Administration has reduced mortgage-insurance premiums on federally-backed loans for 700,000 homeowners; and waived the requirement for title insurance, saving families up to $1,500 to refinance.\n\nThe relief is helping. More people own homes today than did before the pandemic, and we're seeing fewer foreclosures than at any time in decades. But Democrats know the surest way to bring housing costs down long-term is to build to boost supply. So the Administration is cutting red tape to help more builders get federal financing. A record 1.7 million new housing units are under construction today nationwide.\n\nGoing forward, the President has laid out one of America's most ambitious housing plans in over 50 years. It expands rental assistance to a half-million new households, including to low-income veterans and young people aging out of foster care. It offers corporate landlords a basic choice for the next two years: either cap rent increases at 5 percent, or lose a valuable federal tax break. It offers a $10,000 mortgage-relief tax credit to first-time homebuyers, and $25,000 in down-payment assistance to buyers from families where no one has ever before owned a home. At the same time, the Administration is going after unfair rental \"junk fees,\" like fees people are charged just to pay rent online or to receive sorted mail. And, we will crack down on corporate landlords who are gouging tenants, for example by capping the amount they can raise the rent each year; and we will go after negligent landlords who don't maintain basic habitability standards. We will also crack down on those who violate the Fair Housing Act, and on landlords who discriminate against low-income and minority renters and people with housing vouchers. We are rooting bias out of the home appraisal process, which perpetuates the racial wealth gap by unjustly undervaluing millions of Black- and Latino-owned homes.\n\nThe President's plan also calls for funding to help build or renovate 2 million homes nationwide \u2013 by expanding the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit for developers to build affordable rental housing; and by introducing a new Neighborhood Homes Tax Credit, the first ever to focus on creating affordable housing not for renters, but for homeowners. It also creates a Housing Innovation Fund, to help state and local governments find new ways to increase supply, like by converting empty office or hotel space into apartments.The plan also encourages state and local efforts to take on barriers to building new housing.\n\nDemocrats are dedicated to increasing the supply of an array of housing options like duplexes, triplexes, and townhomes that bridge the gap between single-family homes and large apartment buildings. By reducing barriers to building housing and providing federal tax incentives for the development of housing for people of all incomes, we can foster vibrant, inclusive communities where people from all walks of life can find affordable, diverse living options. Workforce housing must also be prioritized to ensure that our nation's teachers, nurses, firefighters, and other essential workers can afford to live in the communities they serve. We recognize that these workers are the backbone of our society, but they are left to struggle with housing costs that outpace their incomes, leaving them unable to live near their workplaces. Democrats will meet this challenge head-on by increasing funding for programs that support the creation and preservation of affordable housing options for essential workers, as well as collaborating with state and local governments to accelerate the development of workforce housing, ensuring that our communities remain accessible and affordable for all.\n\nDemocrats are working to help Americans cover other housing-related costs, like utilities. Families are already saving thousands of dollars with clean energy tax credits; and 23 million households received free or monthly discounts, saving $30 to $75 per month on high-speed broadband through the largest internet affordability program in history. It expired in May, because Republicans refused to act; but Democrats will keep fighting to reinstate it. We'll keep working to expand other programs that reduce home heating, cooling, and water bills as well, especially in rural areas; and to speed the transition to cheaper renewable energy, like solar, that will lower people's bills long-term.\n\nThe Administration is also leading one of America's most ambitious efforts to prevent homelessness. Based on a \"housing first\" principle, it's helping states and cities prioritize housing as the foundational step in delivering support, services, and jobs to rebuild lives. The Administration will work with Congress and local jurisdictions to increase supportive and interim housing options, and the services necessary to help unhoused individuals stay permanently housed.\n\nInstead of trying to solve the problem, Trump has made it worse. Trump has never done anything to ease America's long-standing housing shortage. In fact, he and his allies benefit directly from the housing shortage. The higher the rent, the more that he and his rich real-estate friends earn. For decades, he made a career of inflating rents and putting homeownership out of folks' reach. As a landlord, he was sued for race-based housing discrimination; and he was accused of cutting off tenants' water and heat, to push them out and charge new tenants more. As President, he tried every year to triple rent for low-income Americans in subsidized housing, including the elderly and people with disabilities; and to gut policies that help Black and Latino families access fair housing.\n\nNow, Trump and his MAGA allies are vowing to gut President Biden's historic work. Senate Republicans this spring blocked a bipartisan bill that would've provided tax credits to build 200,000 affordable homes; and they've repeatedly tried to cut affordable housing and rental assistance programs, preferring to protect tax breaks for corporate landlords like Trump instead. They will weaken the independent agencies that protect consumers from rent gouging, and they will make it harder for working families to buy a home, by reinstating higher mortgage insurance premiums, and by privatizing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a windfall to hedge funds.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nDemocrats fundamentally believe that every student deserves a quality education, regardless of their parents' zip code or income.\n\nWe know that education starts well before kids go to kindergarten. Studies show that children who attend preschool are nearly 50 percent more likely to finish high school and go on to earn a two- or four-year degree, no matter their background. That's why Democrats will provide free, universal preschool for four-year olds, saving the families of 5 million children $13,000 a year.\n\nIn the wake of the pandemic, that's especially urgent. The American Rescue Plan made the biggest investment in public education in history, providing $130 billion to help 15,000 districts reopen, rebuild, and catch kids up; funding that has worked to help our children learn. The historic investment spurred long overdue improvements in school facilities and indoor air quality, creating safe and healthy learning environments for students and school staff. Since then, we've also provided an additional $2 billion to high-need, Title I schools. We've helped districts nationwide train and hire 14,000 more counselors and social workers, so kids can heal from the disruptions of COVID, and cope with the fear of gun violence in order to focus on learning. We increased investments in full-service community schools five-fold, providing health care, nutrition, job training, and other wraparound services for kids at school, investing in their futures and making families' lives easier.\n\nThe Administration supports a multitude of approaches that have been proven to help students learn: reducing chronic absenteeism by building social and emotional supports at schools, offering literacy programs, and setting high expectations for student attendance; providing intensive tutoring; extending the school day and school year; expanding community schools; and helping schools to lift student achievement, rather than punishing them based on state standardized tests. We support fully funding IDEA to prioritize students with disabilities and the special educator workforce. We support efforts to provide more timely, well-rounded, actionable feedback on student learning and progress to educators and to families that will support instruction and student success, while upholding rigorous academic standards. We oppose the use of private-school vouchers, tuition tax credits, opportunity scholarships, and other schemes that divert taxpayer-funded resources away from public education. Public tax dollars should never be used to discriminate. And we'll continue working to increase accountability at charters, holding them to the same transparency standards as public schools. We'll prioritize education in cutting-edge STEAM fields as well, especially for students from underrepresented communities, preparing every child to compete and thrive. And we're working to provide every student with a pathway to multilingual education, while ensuring equitable access to a high-quality education for English learners, who've historically been underserved.\n\nA quality, postsecondary education used to be a ticket to the middle class, but the cost that many folks face for higher education today is crippling families, futures, and our entire economy. It has become a barrier to opportunity. Democrats will make quality, affordable, postsecondary education a path forward again.\n\nFour year college is not the only pathway to a good career, so Democrats are investing in other forms of education as well, including career and technical education. The Administration is expanding job training partnerships that connect high schools, local businesses, and labor unions to prepare students for good jobs in high-skill, high-wage, and in-demand industries. It'll make trade school and community college free for every American. And it's making record investments in registered apprenticeships \u2013 which already train more than one million Americans a year across industries, including cutting-edge industries. Some 90 percent of them stay on as full hires, earning an average starting salary of $80,000 a year. That's a path to the middle class that families can count on.\n\nA majority of college students graduate with student debt. It can be an overwhelming stress, as snowballing interest follows folks for decades, defining the choices they make and the jobs they take, and holding back our entire economy. Although Republican appointees on the Supreme Court blocked the President's initial student debt relief plan for 40 million borrowers, he has not stopped using every available tool to provide relief. His Administration already approved the cancellation of $167 billion in loans for nearly 5 million borrowers, including nearly a million public servants like teachers, nurses, and police; and it has outlined plans to deliver relief to 30 million borrowers in all. Meanwhile, its new SAVE plan is the most affordable student-loan repayment plan in history, helping 8 million Americans \u2013 including more than 4.5 million who now have a $0 monthly payment. These savings will transform lives, freeing people to buy a house, to start a family, or to launch a business with new hope.\n\nFor young people just heading to college now, we've already secured the largest increase in Pell Grants in a decade, and we'll further expand these grants to 7 million more students, and double the maximum award by 2029. We've invested a record $16 billion in Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs); and we're working to subsidize tuition at all Minority Serving Institutions for anyone whose family earns less than $125,000 a year.\n\nWhile Democrats work to make the promise of education available to everyone, Trump just sees school as another opportunity for a scam. Trump University not only conned thousands of people into buying worthless degrees, it saddled them with thousands in debt. And, not only are Republicans trying to block our student debt relief, they are slashing funding for job training that ensures workers can access good paying jobs without a four-year degree.\n\nAt the same time, Democrats have educators' backs. Teachers, education support professionals, paraprofessional and school-related personnel, and specialized instructional support personnel are the heart and soul of our communities; they give so much of themselves, and inspire our children to dream. The Administration has canceled student loan debts for more than 942,000 public servants, including educators. Public school educators also deserve a raise. We'll recruit more new teachers, paraprofessionals and school related personnel, and education support professionals, with the option for some to even start training in high school; and we'll help school-support staff to advance in their own careers with a living wage. We will improve working conditions and support to help make teaching a sustainable and affordable profession. We'll keep investing in partnerships with HBCUs, MSIs, and Tribal Colleges and Universities to strengthen and diversify the teacher pipeline, so students of every background can see themselves at the head of the classroom and in charge of their schools.\n\nSOCIAL SECURITY, PENSIONS, & MEDICARE\n\nThe right to a secure and dignified retirement is one of the bedrock principles of American life. Before Social Security, almost half of American seniors lived in poverty. Even those who'd spent a lifetime working didn't always have enough to put food on the table or health care they could count on. Democrats changed that: in 1935, we passed Social Security; in 1965, we signed Medicare and Medicaid into law. These are more than government programs \u2013 they're a promise that we've made as a country, that after a lifetime of hard work, people deserve to retire with dignity and security. They've made tens of millions of lives better.\n\nTrump and his MAGA allies are shredding that sacred trust, and saying they'll cut Social Security to give billionaires another tax cut. Trump has called Social Security a \"Ponzi Scheme\" and warned \"there's a lot you can do in terms of cutting.\" As President, he tried to slash both Social Security and Medicare programs in every budget, and to gut Medicaid, which provides home care to over seven million seniors and people with disabilities. House Republicans have vowed to cut Social Security by over $1.5 trillion, to raise the retirement age, and to transform Medicare into a voucher-like system, threatening the program. Trump will also eliminate protections for private retirement savings, by undermining the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and making it easier for banks to rip off seniors with expensive, hidden fees.\n\nDemocrats won't let that happen. Generations of Americans have paid into these programs, with every paycheck of their lives. We'll never back down from our ironclad commitment to protecting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. We reject any effort to privatize Social Security or to cut any of the benefits that the American people have earned. Middle-class Americans pay 6.2 percent of their income to support Social Security, and the self-employed pay twice that. But people with multi-million dollar incomes pay a fraction of 1 percent. We'll strengthen the program and expand benefits by asking the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share. We also oppose any actions to cut Medicare benefits. We'll look to expand traditional Medicare coverage to include dental, vision, and hearing services, which are so key to health and quality of life, by making the wealthy and big corporations pay their fair share.\n\nThe fact is that both Social Security and Medicare are in a stronger fiscal position today than when President Biden took office. Our strong economic recovery has helped to extend Medicare solvency by a decade. And the President's prescription drug reforms will save it hundreds of billions of dollars, by finally empowering Medicare to directly negotiate lower prices with drug companies, and to collect rebates if Big Pharma hikes prices faster than inflation. If Republicans repeal our reforms, they'll erase those savings and put Medicare itself at risk. Democrats will make Medicare permanently solvent, by making the wealthy pay their fair share in Medicare taxes.\n\nDemocrats will stand firm to protect retirement security across the board. In 2021, we passed the Butch-Lewis Act, preserving the pensions of 3 million union workers and retirees who would've seen deep cuts, and reversing pension cuts for over 100,000 workers. Going forward, we'll amend federal bankruptcy laws to make sure no other retirees ever run that same risk. The Administration is also cracking down on junk fees in retirement savings, and reversed a Trump-era rule that had allowed financial advisors to put their own interests before their clients'. Democrats want to make it easier for everyone to save for retirement and retire with dignity.\n\nChapter Four: Tackling the Climate Crisis, Lowering Energy Costs, & Securing Energy Independence\n\nEvery year, the devastation caused by climate change grows more urgent. Across the country, Americans experience the dire impacts of climate change: Floods and storms wipe more homes off the map. Wildfire smoke spreads thousands of miles, forcing millions to shelter indoors. We've had the worst droughts in a thousand years, and the fastest sea-level rise in over a century. Last year was Earth's hottest on record. Natural disasters and extreme weather have cost America over one trillion dollars in damages in just the last seven years. And they hit the most vulnerable among us hardest \u2013 seniors, people with disabilities, people in neighborhoods without resources to blunt the impact.\n\nThe climate crisis is decades in the making, an existential threat to future generations who deserve better. It's a consequence of delay and destruction by people like Donald Trump and his friends in Big Oil, who still deny what we all see happening right before our eyes.\n\nPresident Biden is delivering on the most aggressive climate agenda in history. His landmark legislation has unleashed a clean energy boom that's slashing pollution, lowering energy costs, and has already created over 300,000 good-paying American clean energy jobs. America is now producing more energy than ever in its history. He has taken more environmental actions than any president before him \u2013 providing cleaner air and water, making communities more resilient, and forcing polluters to pay for the damage they've done. He is on track to protect more of America's lands and waters than any president before him, and he has restored our global climate leadership. He is positioning America to lead the future \u2013 energy independent, resilient, innovative, and strong.\n\nTrump is only interested in himself and his wealthy donors, who got rich polluting our country. As president, he gutted more than 125 environmental policies that had protected the American people from toxic pollution, everywhere from sewage plants, to oil and gas fields, to our own homes. He pulled out of the Paris Climate Agreement at Big Oil's urging, weakening America's role in the world. He fired scientists from federal agencies, replacing them with oil and gas lobbyists who rewrote our nation's environmental rules. And he handed oil companies $25 billion in tax breaks.\n\nNow, Trump is set to do Big Oil's and polluters' bidding again. He told oil executives he'd reverse our climate progress and slash their taxes once more \u2013 if they'd give him $1 billion for his campaign. Oil and gas lobbyists are already drafting executive orders for him to sign on day one. He wants to roll back the clean energy progress that President Biden has made, gut the Environmental Protection Agency, and let polluters dump dangerous PFAS chemicals in our water. His MAGA allies have tried 42 times to repeal our landmark climate law. If they succeed, they'll eliminate tens of thousands of good-paying jobs, drive up home energy costs, sicken thousands of Americans with toxic pollution, and cede the race for the future to China.\n\nPRODUCING CLEANER, MORE AFFORDABLE ENERGY\n\nAcross the world, we're seeing massive new clean energy production and uptake. We're at the dawn of a new era that will redefine the global economy, and that America must lead.\n\nPresident Biden's Investing in America agenda makes the largest clean-energy investment in history; and it has already attracted over $400 billion in private sector commitments, to develop and manufacture solar, wind, battery, and other clean technologies here at home. Today, 585 new clean energy manufacturing projects are underway \u2013 not just on the coasts, but in 47 states, including in places too often left behind. Some 81 percent of the investments made since our landmark climate law passed are going to counties with below-average weekly wages.\n\nAmerica is making leaps forward in energy generation and storage, while modernizing our electricity grid and upgrading transmission lines to deliver reliable, clean power. Private sector companies have announced investment in solar modules that will power 18 million homes; and the Biden-Harris Administration has approved the first nine commercial offshore wind projects in federal waters, set to power nearly 5 million homes. Large-scale energy storage capacity has increased twelve-fold since the President took office, and is expected to double again by year's end.\n\nThis clean energy boom has already created over 300,000 jobs and lowered energy costs for millions of families. It puts us on track to triple clean-energy generation by 2030, reducing Big Oil's hold on our economy, protecting families from wild price swings, and bringing America closer to energy independence than we've been in over 70 years.\n\nGoing forward, Democrats will keep working to incentivize investment in transmission upgrades and new lines, and in the grid-component manufacturing that's needed to support that growth. We will improve and speed up the processes of environmental review and clean-energy permitting; and further scale up development of clean energy on public lands.\n\nWe'll also continue to invest in clean energy research and development, building on America's legacy as a nation of new frontiers and possibilities. To help find new ways of generating and storing energy, reducing emissions, and boosting climate resilience, we'll launch an Advanced Research Projects Agency for Climate (ARPA-C), modeled on the defense research agency that's behind breakthrough technologies like the internet and GPS, and the new ARPA-H that the Administration created to transform medicine. We'll also establish a new national lab for climate research and innovation, affiliated with an HBCU, Hispanic-, or other Minority-Serving Institution, to ensure the opportunities of the future are available to everyone, and built by everyone. And we will continue to invest in climate research across NASA, NOAA, the National Science Foundation, and other agencies, to make sure that America leads the world in clean energy innovation.\n\nLOWERING ENERGY COSTS\n\nDemocrats' historic climate and clean energy agenda is lowering energy costs for families and small businesses long-term and today \u2013 with cheaper, cleaner energy and with tax credits to make home energy use more efficient and affordable. America's clean energy boom is giving everyone more energy choices than ever, and more choices mean lower prices. According to the Department of Energy, our policies are expected to slash overall electricity rates by 9 percent and gas prices by as much as 13 percent by 2030, saving Americans tens of billions of dollars.\n\nAt the same time, the Inflation Reduction Act is providing tax credits and rebates to make Americans' homes more efficient, so families can immediately start saving on their energy costs, now and for years to come. Families can reduce their bills up to $2,000 a year by making their homes more energy efficient with new insulation, windows, and doors; and by installing rooftop solar panels, home battery storage, and electric pumps for heating and cooling. Democrats are also offering rebates on new, energy-efficient appliances; and people can save up to $7,500 when they buy a new plug-in hybrid or fully electric car, or $4,000 if they buy a used one.\n\nThe Administration has toughened efficiency standards on new appliances and cars as well, which will further reduce emissions and energy bills. New fuel economy and tailpipe standards alone are expected to save drivers some $6,000 per car by reducing fuel and maintenance costs.\n\nThe Administration has also taken historic action to lower gas prices at the pump, by standing up to Big Oil's price gouging, releasing strategic reserves to blunt profiteering, and promoting competition with cleaner, cheaper, renewable fuel.\n\nCREATING CLEAN ENERGY JOBS\n\nPresident Biden has long said that when he thinks about climate change, he thinks about jobs. Good-paying union jobs that people can raise a family on. As President, he's delivering. The clean energy manufacturing and deployment boom ignited by his landmark climate law has so far directly created over 300,000 jobs in communities nationwide; and we're making sure those jobs meet rigorous worker and environmental safety standards. The legislation is helping to push American factory construction to an all-time high as well, as we build new plants to make things like batteries and electric vehicles, solar panels and wind turbines, and bring the supply chains needed to power a clean energy future home.\n\nThe President's agenda also includes extended Buy Clean and Buy America standards, requiring federal projects to use low-carbon, American-made cement, steel, and other materials; and providing credits for private companies to do the same, creating more American jobs. It also provides extra incentives for private companies to hire registered apprentices and pay prevailing wages. Through executive action and with Congress, Democrats will continue to work to create strong labor standards for jobs created with taxpayer dollars.\n\nTo help prepare people for these jobs, Democrats launched the American Climate Corps, a new workforce training and service initiative that will put more than 20,000 young Americans to work on clean energy, conservation, and climate resilience projects nationwide. President Biden has set a goal to triple the size of the American Climate Corps by the end of this decade, ensuring that young people are given the skills and tools they need to succeed in careers in our new clean energy and climate resilience economies. The Administration is also making record investments in registered apprenticeships, including in clean energy industries. Registered apprenticeships train more than a million Americans a year across industries, 90 percent of whom stay on in those jobs as full hires. We're also boosting investment in STEM education and workforce training programs for women and at Historically Black Colleges and Universities and other Minority Serving Institutions, to make sure the clean energy and manufacturing jobs of tomorrow are open and accessible to communities that have been too often left out in the past.\n\nThe Administration is also investing in new sources of income for America's farmers, and working to make our farm sector the world's first to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. Under President Biden's landmark climate law, the Agriculture Department is paying farmers to adopt climate-smart practices, which sequester carbon from the atmosphere, improve soil health and biodiversity, and restore water cycles, all while opening new revenue streams from ecosystem services markets. Already, over 80,000 farms covering 75 million acres have adopted these practices.\n\nAbove all, Democrats will unite against the Republican war on clean energy, blocking their obsessive attempts to repeal President Biden's clean energy investments. Republicans will not be allowed to pull the rug out from American clean energy businesses, send hundreds of thousands of jobs overseas, and strip all Americans of cheaper, cleaner energy choices, all to please their special interest backers.\n\nREDUCING POLLUTION & MAKING POLLUTERS PAY\n\nThese transformative investments in American energy are lowering energy costs, creating good-paying jobs, revitalizing local economies, and reducing pollution.\n\nTransportation is America's biggest emitter, responsible for a third of emissions. The Administration has put us on track to eliminate all carbon from the sector by 2050. It's making generational investments in transportation infrastructure, including in cleaner shipping, trucking, transit, rail, and aviation. It issued the toughest-ever fuel economy and tailpipe standards, so new cars both get better mileage, and reduce emissions per mile by as much as 50 percent.\n\nWith tax credits, Democrats helped quadruple sales of electric vehicles, with the goal that 50 percent of all new passenger cars sold in the U.S. by 2030 be electric. We're protecting American children from asthma-related diesel pollution by giving school districts rebates to buy thousands of electric school buses so kids don't have to breathe polluted air. We'll keep working to electrify the nation's fleet of school buses, transit buses, and federal vehicles, including the U.S. Postal Service fleet. We'll double funding to repair and expand active transportation and public transit, reducing pollution and traffic, and connecting people to jobs and opportunity. And we'll work to electrify our ports and waterways, prioritizing progress towards a goal of zero-emissions freight.\n\nWe'll keep pushing to reduce emissions from America's buildings and heavy industry. We support local and state efforts to adopt energy-efficient building codes. We'll require that low-carbon materials and clean power be used in all new federal buildings by 2030, and invest in upgrading VA hospitals, federal offices, and K-12 public school and community college buildings, making them innovative, energy efficient, and safe places to learn. And we'll support investments in heavy industry, to make America the leader in clean steel, cement, aluminum, and other products.\n\nWe'll also keep stepping up action to crack down on other forms of air and water pollution, repairing damage done by Trump's failed oversight, and making polluters pay. The Administration has strengthened dozens of environmental and safety standards to reduce smog, soot, carbon, methane, mercury, and other toxic pollutants in our communities. After 30 years of inadequate protections, we finally banned all cancer-causing asbestos, including from homes, cars, and water filtration sites. And we prohibited the use of chlorpyrifos, a pesticide that can sicken farmworkers and children.\n\nWe also set America's first national drinking water standard to finally protect local water supplies from pollution with PFAS, toxic \"forever chemicals\" linked to cancer. Through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we're upgrading wastewater systems. And we're replacing every toxic lead pipe in America \u2013 long-overdue work that will finally guarantee that every person in the country can turn on the faucet and drink clean water.\n\nThe Bipartisan Infrastructure Law also includes important work to speed the cleanup of toxic Superfund and brownfield sites that have leached poisonous waste into nearby neighborhoods for decades. To cover those costs, the law finally restored a vital \"polluter pays\" tax that had lapsed 26 years before, once again collecting revenue on any chemical sold in the United States, and directing it to the Superfund Trust Fund to pay for cleanup.\n\nAt the same time, the Administration has greatly increased civil and criminal enforcement of our nation's environmental laws, boosting funding for the Justice Department and Environmental Protection Agency, resulting in faster cleanups and tougher compliance. We support increased monitoring, transparency, and community engagement in this work.\n\nThroughout, we'll keep standing up to Big Oil, as our clean energy boom breaks the industry's monopoly hold on energy markets. For the first time in 100 years, we've increased the royalties that oil and gas companies have to pay to drill or mine on public lands; and we're charging at least 10 times more for the bonds that are required to hold companies accountable for cleaning up drilling sites or capping their abandoned wells, which have been left to spew methane. States and private landowners have for years charged more than the federal government does to lease their lands; it's time the",

        "text": "US intelligence officials say Iran is to blame for hacks targeting Trump, Biden-Harris campaigns\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 U.S. intelligence officials said Monday they were confident that Iran was responsible for the hack of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, casting the cyber intrusion as part of a brazen and broader effort by Tehran to interfere in American politics and potentially shape the outcome of the election.\n\nThe assessment from the FBI and other federal agencies was the first time the U.S. government has assigned blame for hacks that have raised anew the threat of foreign election interference and underscored how Iran, in addition to more sophisticated adversaries like Russia and China, remains a top concern. Besides breaching the Trump campaign, officials also believe that Iran tried to hack into the presidential campaign of Kamala Harris.\n\nThe hacking and similar activities, federal officials said, are meant to sow discord, exploit divisions within American society and possibly to influence the outcome of elections that Iran perceives to be \u201cparticularly consequential in terms of the impact they could have on its national security interests,\u201d officials said.\n\n\u201cWe have observed increasingly aggressive Iranian activity during this election cycle, specifically involving influence operations targeting the American public and cyber operations targeting Presidential campaigns,\u201d said the statement released by the FBI, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.\n\nIran\u2019s mission to the United Nations denied the allegations as \u201cunsubstantiated and devoid of any standing,\u201d saying that Iran had neither the motive nor intention to interfere with the election. It challenged the U.S. to provide evidence and said if the U.S. does so, \u201cwe will respond accordingly.\u201d\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nThe FBI statement was released at a time of significant tensions between Washington and Tehran as the U.S. hopes to halt or limit a threatened retaliatory strike on Israel over the assassination of Hamas official Ismail Haniyeh in Iran. In addition, an Israeli strike last month in southern Beirut killed Hezbollah\u2019s top commander, but while Tehran and Iran-backed Hezbollah have vowed to retaliate, they have not yet launched strikes as diplomatic endeavors and Gaza cease-fire talks continue in Qatar.\n\nThe U.S. did not detail how it reached the conclusion that Iran was responsible, nor did it describe the nature of any information that may have been stolen from the Trump campaign. But it said the intelligence community was confident \u201cthe Iranians have through social engineering and other efforts sought access to individuals with direct access to the Presidential campaigns of both political parties.\u201d\n\nAt least three staffers in the Biden-Harris campaign were targeted with phishing emails, but investigators have uncovered no evidence the attempt was successful, The Associated Press reported last week.\n\n\u201cSuch activity, including thefts and disclosures, are intended to influence the U.S. election process. It is important to note that this approach is not new. Iran and Russia have employed these tactics not only in the United States during this and prior federal election cycles but also in other countries around the world,\u201d the statement said.\n\nU.S. officials have been on high alert in recent election cycles for foreign influence campaigns and outright interference as in 2016, when Russian military intelligence operatives hacked the campaign of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and orchestrated the release of politically damaging emails through the website WikiLeaks.\n\nIran has more recently emerged as an aggressive threat to American elections. In 2020, U.S. intelligence officials say, Iran carried out an influence campaign aimed at harming Trump\u2019s reelection bid that was probably approved by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and was the subject of an unusual evening news conference featuring FBI Director Christopher Wray and other officials.\n\nU.S. officials also have expressed alarm about Tehran\u2019s efforts to seek retaliation for a 2020 strike on an Iranian general that was ordered by Trump.\n\nThe Trump campaign disclosed on Aug. 10 that it had been hacked and said Iranian actors had stolen and distributed sensitive internal documents. At least three news outlets \u2014 Politico, The New York Times and The Washington Post \u2014 were leaked confidential material from inside the Trump campaign. So far, each has refused to reveal any details about what it received.\n\nPolitico reported that it began receiving emails on July 22 from an anonymous account. The source \u2014 an AOL email account identified only as \u201cRobert\u201d \u2014 passed along what appeared to be a research dossier the campaign had apparently done on the Republican vice presidential nominee, Ohio Sen. JD Vance. The document was dated Feb. 23, almost five months before Trump selected Vance as his running mate.\n\nThe U.S. government\u2019s assessment aligns with the findings of private companies.\n\nEarlier this month, Microsoft issued a report on Iranian agents\u2019 attempts to interfere in this year\u2019s election. It said Iran had impersonated activists and created fake news targeted to voters on opposite sides of the political spectrum. The report also cited an instance of an Iranian military intelligence unit in June sending \u201ca spear-phishing email to a high-ranking official of a presidential campaign from a compromised email account of a former senior advisor.\u201d\n\nIn a separate report, Google said an Iranian group linked to the country\u2019s Revolutionary Guard has tried to infiltrate the personal email accounts of roughly a dozen people linked to President Joe Biden and Trump since May.\n\n____\n\nAssociated Press writer Edith M. Lederer at the United Nations contributed to this report.",

        "text": "How Russian gender-based disinformation could influence the 2024 U.S. presidential election\nMost people have a general understanding of disinformation \u2014 false information that is intentionally created to cause harm. Disinformation becomes \u201cgendered\u201d when deliberately false information draws on common understandings of issues like masculinity, femininity and sexual violence.\n\nAlthough gender-based disinformation does not receive as much attention as race-based disinformation, it\u2019s particularly dangerous because it taps into deep-seated beliefs about our own identities.\n\nNarratives about gender identity are also harder to fact-check than simple true or false stories.\n\nAs the Democratic Convention gets underway in Chicago, Vice President Kamala Harris is increasingly vulnerable to gender-based disinformation campaigns \u2014 if she isn\u2019t already a victim of them.\n\nRead more: In Chicago, security at the Democratic National Convention aims to avoid a repetition of the 1968 violence\n\nRussian gender-based disinformation\n\nScholars have long understood that women politicians regularly experience misogynistic comments, but gender-based disinformation is insidious in other ways.\n\nStates like Russia target the citizens of western countries with gender-based disinformation to promote their foreign policy goals.\n\nWhen Canada assumed leadership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\u2019s (NATO) battle group in Latvia, Russia spread gender-based disinformation to Latvian Russian-speakers to undermine local support for Canada\u2019s mission. These campaigns claimed that the Canadian Armed Forces were filled with homosexuals and potential rapists. The core message was that Latvians should not trust Canadians.\n\nRecent studies have also found that Russia strategically uses bots and trolls to spread false stories about female politicians to influence public opinion before elections. If a male candidate aligns more closely with Russia\u2019s foreign policy goals, it may use gendered narratives to discredit that candidate\u2019s female opponent.\n\nRead more: Trump's lies about the election show how disinformation erodes democracy\n\nThis type of gender-based disinformation often inflates the credibility of male candidates by portraying women as being unqualified, overly emotional, prone to lying and unintelligent.\n\nThese disinformation campaigns use cutting-edge technology to convey the right narratives to the right people. During its interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Russia used data crumbs commonly employed by internet marketers to \u201cmicro-target\u201d social media users with select disinformation based on their specific psychological and socioeconomic markers, as well as their political beliefs.\n\n(AP Photo/Jon Elswick)\n\nThe 2024 election campaign\n\nAmericans should be aware of an onslaught of gender-based disinformation about Harris that will likely gain momentum after this week\u2019s Democratic National Convention.\n\nWhen Hillary Clinton ran for office in 2016, little was known about gender-based disinformation. Now that authorities know and understand the disinformation tactics used during that election, Americans can prepare for the ballot box with the lessons learned from history.\n\nRead more: Kamala Harris's run for president: Republican misogyny may backfire this time\n\nThere are two disinformation tactics favoured by Russia and used in 2016 that it will likely use again in 2024.\n\nOne is to portray a candidate as inauthentic or hypocritical.\n\nClinton was the first female nominee of a major party and had the potential to mobilize female voters. To undermine domestic support for Clinton, Russia spread news stories that suggested that even though she was a woman, her policies belie the feminist cause, implying that real feminists should not support her.\n\nDuring the 2020 U.S. presidential election, Harris was similarly targeted with disinformation after Biden announced her as his running mate. There were claims that she did not deserve to be vice president because she was merely a diversity hire and had used sex to gain power. Those claims have been repeated since she became the party\u2019s presidential candidate.\n\n(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)\n\nSegmentation is the second Russian tactic. It entails polarizing society and fragmenting groups at the same time. Research shows that one of the primary goals of state-sponsored disinformation campaigns is to break apart the social fabric of a country by amplifying social, cultural and political fault lines.\n\nAhead of the 2016 presidential election, one study found that Russian-backed accounts on Twitter (now X) spread narratives attacking feminists, claiming that they were \u201cman-hating\u201d ideologues who sought to suppress men\u2019s rights. Polarizing narratives like this were designed to create divisions between feminists and non-feminists.\n\nAt the same time, Russia sought to fragment the feminist movement. Accounts linked to Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency posed as feminists on Twitter to critique other feminists, claiming that feminism was too white to represent black feminists or too liberal to represent conservative feminists. Although these may be valid critiques of the feminist movement, Russia instrumentally used them to divide voters who might have come together to support Clinton.\n\nBaseless attacks on Harris\n\nAlthough links to states like Russia are unclear, the media environment is already filled with gender-based disinformation about Harris.\n\nA recent study found that among 130,000 public posts on X, Instagram and TikTok, 15 per cent of them erroneously claimed that Joe Biden called Harris a \u201cdiversity hire,\u201d seven per cent highlighted a video of a television judge slandering her, and three per cent made scurrilous and false allegations about her sexual history. X owner Elon Musk even circulated a deep fake video of Harris confirming that Biden selected her because she is a Black woman \u2014 the \u201cultimate diversity hire.\u201d\n\nGender-based disinformation is already part of the presidential election. Voters need to know that they are exposed to false information, and that it\u2019s not benign. It is often constructed by states like Russia to influence elections and undermine America\u2019s social cohesion.",

        "text": "Why CBC News follows the U.S. presidential election\nWe use this editor's blog to explain our journalism and what's happening at CBC News. You can find more blogs here .\n\nWe are just over two months from the U.S. presidential election and the culmination of a contest that appeared to turn upside down in the space of a few weeks this summer.\n\nFirst, there was the attempted assassination attempt on Donald Trump followed just a few days later by his triumphant nomination at the Republican National Convention. Within a week, Joe Biden had succumbed to pressure within his own party to drop out, setting up Kamala Harris for a quick acclamation as the Democratic nominee and renewed vigour to the Democratic presidential campaign.\n\nOur journalists in CBC's Washington bureau have seen a lot over the last decade, and even their heads were spinning by the pace and scale of these developments!\n\nWith the start of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago and the first debate between Trump and Harris scheduled for Sept. 10, I can say three things with certainty:\n\nThere will be no shortage of news from the campaign and we will be there to report it, including robust election night coverage through to inauguration.\n\nA large number of Canadians care about the race and are tuning in, driving up ratings and pageviews for CBC, but also for the big American news outlets available in Canada.\n\nCBC News will get complaints from members of our audience who question why we give a U.S. election so much time and focus.\n\nIt's that last bullet point I want to address.\n\nIt goes without saying that the overwhelming majority of our journalism each day remains dedicated to local and national news (as evidenced when you scroll through the 30-plus pages under CBCNews.ca , including our 20 regional news sites).\n\nAt the same time, world coverage has been a hallmark of CBC News since the public broadcaster was founded, and we dedicate more resources to international reporting than any other media outlet in Canada.\n\nWithin our coverage of the world, the United States occupies a special place for some obvious reasons. From arts and culture, national security, the economy to the environment \u2014 our countries are inextricably linked.\n\nWe share the longest international border in the world, with two-thirds of Canadians living within 100 kilometres of it. More than three quarters of our total exports travel over that border each year, along with $3 billion worth of trade and 400,000 people each day .\n\nThere are more Canadian citizens living in the United States \u2014 about 800,000 \u2014 than in any other country in the world.\n\nWe share continental and transatlantic defence obligations , intelligence strategy and environmental policy . American tech giants dominate the platforms and information ecosystems that Canadians use to make, share and consume content. (And by the way, we consume a lot of American culture, with U.S.-made movies , programs , video games and music commanding the lion's share of our discretionary attention and dollars.)\n\nSimply put, the United States and the policies of its government have a direct and daily impact on the lives of most Canadians. It can easily be argued that the U.S. presidential election matters more to Canadians than any other election beyond our own.\n\nAnd yet, it is not OUR election, which gives CBC News the unique ability to zoom out from the daily horse race, watch from a distance and provide you with an outsider's perspective and the Canadian context you won't find in U.S. media coverage.\n\nWe are at our best when we cover this race through a Canadian lens and zero-in on what matters to us and our country. We pledge to do this while balancing the demands of the daily news cycle and coverage of the latest developments.",

        "text": "Video: U-M expert examines national security concerns as election season heats up\nEXPERT ANALYSIS\n\nEvery presidential election season comes with a host of national security concerns, and the 2024 campaign is no different.\n\nAmong other things, it\u2019s contending with fallout from the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump at a campaign event, threats of wider war in the Middle East and continued cyberattacks.\n\nJaved Ali\n\nJaved Ali, associate professor of practice at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ford School of Public Policy and former senior U.S. government counterterrorism official, discusses the risks as well as implications for the campaigns and the country.\n\nOn security considerations and priorities related to the Democratic National Convention:\n\nThere\u2019s been a major security presence there already, and the planning for that has been going on for several months, if not longer. These big events, whether they\u2019re national conventions, state of the unions or other high-profile things, are usually designated as national security special events.\n\nThat means between the Secret Service and the Department of Homeland Security, they plan all the security arrangements for these things. So just based on the convention and how significant that is, there is going to be layers and layers of security, both around the convention center itself and then the surrounding parts of downtown Chicago. They also try to control the airspace above as well.\n\nNow I would have to think there are going to be potential lessons learned from the assassination attempt (on Trump) at the rally last month. And even though this is an inside event, there\u2019s still probably small things they have looked at and perhaps tweaked to make sure the possibility of that lone shooter threat to people even trying to come inside the building is minimized to the greatest extent possible.\n\nYou\u2019re never going to kind of have 100% security at these events. But the secure security planning and preparations have been underway for a long time, and they will be very robust.\n\nOn tensions in the Middle East between Iran and Israel:\n\nThe dual Israeli targeted strikes last month against a senior Hezbollah commander in Beirut, and then just hours later, the death of the Hamas political chief in Tehran last have raised the prospect of a broader conflict outside of just the Israel-Hamas war that has been grinding on for 10 months.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of those strikes, both the leadership of Hezbollah and the supreme leader of Iran both vowed significant retaliation. Over that period of time, there have been warnings from the U.S. side that perhaps both Hezbollah and Iran were preparing something significant.\n\nAnd what that meant or what that preparation was, it\u2019s not clear to us on the outside. But it may have been the potential to launch an attack like Iran launched against Israel in April with what then included a combination of 300 ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, drones.\n\nSo maybe Iran and or Hezbollah was planning to do something like that. But here we are now, two-plus weeks later, and that response has not yet happened.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s because cooler heads have prevailed. Maybe neither side wants to get dragged into a war with Israel. And maybe it\u2019s because all these parties are now waiting to see what happens with a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that finally ends this terrible, terrible conflict there\u2014and brings the hostages back and allows for, you know, Palestinians to resume some kind of level of normalcy and begin the rebuilding and reconstruction process.\n\nThere are so many variables in play, but right now it doesn\u2019t seem like that immediate escalation to full-out regional war is as likely now as it perhaps was a couple of weeks ago, and that\u2019s a good thing.\n\nBut again, things are very volatile\u2014it could change at the drop of a hat. And a lot of this is based on perceptions as well about where things are headed. At least my sense is we\u2019re not yet looking at a wider regional conflict.\n\nOn cyberattacks against the presidential campaigns, including the most recent that appear to involve Iran:\n\nI think that\u2019s sort of separate from Iran\u2019s agenda. With this regional conflict, Iran has been trying to influence U.S. elections going back a decade. So this isn\u2019t necessarily new. From that perspective, I think that tradecraft is different.\n\nI do think we are going to continue to see countries like Russia, China, Iran, Venezuela and others try to at least influence our elections through misinformation, disinformation and propaganda\u2014most of which is going to be channeled through social media. Those countries have been doing that since 2016.\n\nThe more sinister aspect of the threat is on the election interference side. That\u2019s actually when these potential countries could try to get into some part of the electronic infrastructure of how voting occurs here in the United States, which is very disaggregated and happens at the state and local level. The Russians tried that in 2016, or at least they tried to build in a capability.\n\nI also think that all the countries I just mentioned are probably scanning and probing for those electronic vulnerabilities in that election voting infrastructure. And if they choose to decide to interfere, they could. But if they did that, that would be seen as very provocative. And the U.S. response would probably have to be very significant.\n\nI think it\u2019s going to be another difficult moment from a security perspective. But planning for these things now is the right thing to do. And that\u2019s what I think at the federal level, DHS and FBI are doing, and then working with all of their counterparts at the state and local level throughout the entire United States to make sure we have the best security we can, both on the electronic side and the physical side.",

(Photo Credit: U.S Army graphic by Rebecca Westfall) VIEW ORIGINAL\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 For Soldiers, navigating between personal political views and their duty to be apolitical can be a delicate balancing act.\n\nWith campaign season here and political polarization increasing, service members need to be aware of political activities in which they may and may not engage.\n\n\u201cMaintaining the hard-earned trust and confidence of the American people requires Soldiers to avoid any action that could imply endorsement of a political party, political candidate or campaign by any element of the Army,\u201d said Donald Lobeda, associate deputy general counsel, Army Office of the General Counsel.\n\nThe Department of Defense Directive 1344.10 serves as the guiding principle for active-duty military personnel on how to maintain the armed forces as an apolitical force.\n\nSoldiers are permitted to participate in political activities, such as exercising their right to vote and attending political events as spectators \u2014 as long as they are not in uniform. However, Soldiers are subject to restrictions involving political activities. For instance, active-duty Soldiers may not campaign or speak for a partisan political candidate.\n\nActive-duty Soldiers should also keep these three things in mind when engaging in political activities:\n\nDon\u2019t engage in political fundraising. Soldiers may not solicit, accept or receive political contributions at any place or at any time. Soldiers may not be a nominee or candidate for any civil office unless the Secretary of the Army grants permission. Army resources may not be used for political activities or to conduct political activities in the workplace.\n\n\"Bottom line is that all Soldiers should avoid conduct that might cause a person to think that their political activities imply, or appear to imply, Army sponsorship, approval, or endorsement of a political candidate, party, campaign, or cause,\u201d said Lobeda.\n\nSoldiers should use discretion and carefully consider the potential consequences of their actions pertaining to politics, whether they are on-duty or off-duty, whether they are engaged in conduct on-line or in the real world.\n\nRELATED LINKS:\n\nArmy News Service\n\nARNEWS archives",

The poll revealed that the Latino electorate is highly motivated to participate in the 2024 elections, paying attention to the policy positions championed by candidates, and positioned to play a decisive role in key battleground states.\n\nResults from the poll, which BSP Research conducted from August 6-10, show that there is renewed enthusiasm within the Latino electorate, \u2013 with a striking 57% of respondents replying that they are more interested in voting due to Vice President Harris entering the presidential election. The poll also found that economic issues were top of mind for Latino voters with respondents choosing cost of living/inflation (60%), jobs and the economy (38%), and housing costs (29%) as the most important issues for elected officials to address.\n\nThe Latino electorate is the second largest voting bloc in the United States and continues to experience historic growth with Latinos projected to account for nearly 15% of all eligible voters in November 2024. An estimated 36.2 million Latinos are eligible to vote this year, up from 32.3 million in 2020 \u2013 and of Latino voters, about 25% will be voting for the very first time.\n\nAs organizations with decades of experience in mobilizing Latino voters and building greater Latino power and representation nationwide, Hispanic Federation and Latino Victory Foundation, partnered in this poll to highlight the need for candidates to engage with and understand the needs and aspirations of Latino voters.\n\n\u201cThe findings of our poll confirm what we have been saying all along: Latino voters are paying attention and will be the deciding factor in the 2024 election. However, the poll also reveals that there is still a lot of work to do around Latino outreach and engagement, and the candidates must do more to engage Latinos on the issues that resonate with them. Latinos want to hear about their plans to create economic opportunities, address the need for humane immigration policies, confront gun violence, and protect reproductive rights,\u201d said Frankie Miranda, President and CEO of the Hispanic Federation. \u201cHF will continue to work with our partner network of 750 Latino community-based organizations to provide nonpartisan information, mobilize our community to the polls, and ensure that the voices of the 64 million Latinos living in the U.S. are heard in 2024 and beyond.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis new poll supports what we at Latino Victory and Hispanic Federation have long known: Latinos are not a monolithic group, particularly when it comes to voting,\u201d said Luis A. Miranda, Jr., Chair of Latino Victory. \u201cHarris\u2019s candidacy is supported by more Puerto Rican voters than by Mexican Americans and other Latino voting groups. There is also a considerable gender gap among Latinos and Latinas, despite Harris winning over both men and women overall \u2013 35% of Latino men support Trump while only 23% of Latinas support his candidacy. The parties still have a lot of work to do to solidify the Latino vote for their respective candidate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that Vice President Harris has injected considerable enthusiasm into the presidential contest and this poll confirms what is being reported on the ground and with huge crowds at Harris rallies, that is, Latino voters report high levels of favorability and trust in Kamala Harris to tackle the issues important to the Latino community,\u201d said Matt Barreto, Founding Partner and President, BSP Research.\n\n\u201cLatino voters will be a deciding factor in this election,\u201d said Sindy Benavides, President and CEO of Latino Victory Foundation. \u201cTheir renewed enthusiasm to vote after Vice President Harris entered the election is a welcome sign of the times, but organizations like Latino Victory and Hispanic Federation know too well that Latino voters are persuasion voters. Candidates and organizations must invest to ramp up voter engagement among this powerhouse community. We\u2019re thrilled to see Latinos are enthusiastic about voting in this high-stakes election, but this only means we have our work cut out to ensure this enthusiasm translates into actual votes \u2013 and we\u2019re ready for the challenge!\u201d\n\nKey takeaways from the poll include:\n\n73% of registered Latino voters are almost certain they will vote in the 2024 Presidential election\n\nHarris emergence has generated enthusiasm across key segments that Democrats will need to consolidate, with 57% of respondents replying that they are more interested in voting due to Vice President Harris entering the presidential election\n\nNew excitement is especially true for women, younger, and more Spanish speaking Latinos\n\nInflation and cost of living remain the top issue by a large margin: 60% cited as top issue\n\nJobs (38%) and housing costs and affordability (29%), rank high after inflation\n\nOutside of economic concerns, immigration issues (21%) and reform (20%), gun violence (20%), and abortion rights (18%) are the top cited concerns\n\nThe majority of Latino voters do not feel well informed on candidates\u2019 policy proposals and platforms\n\nIn a combined 2-way vote, Harris led former President Donald Trump by 24 points, 59% to 35% among registered Latino voters\n\nThe snapshot poll is just the beginning. The partners intend to conduct additional polling throughout the election cycle to reveal additional insights about this key growing voter bloc and develop nonpartisan get out the vote culturally competent messaging that is tailored to specific local communities.\n\nBSP collected 600 interviews with registered Latino voters of all backgrounds from across the country, with a nominal margin of error of +/- 4.0%. The poll fielded from August 6-9, with a sample size of 600 voters, reached by cell phone, email invite, or online voter panels.\n\nDownload a PDF of the poll results here.\n\n###\n\nAbout Hispanic Federation:\n\nHispanic Federation (HF) is a nonprofit membership and advocacy organization, founded in 1990, committed to empowering and advancing the Hispanic community, with a focus on low-income, marginalized and immigrant Latinos.

        "text": "A brief history of presidential candidate debates\nDebates between presidential candidates have become an important part of the election process every four years, but in historical terms, these events are relatively new.\n\nThe first widely seen debates between presidential nominees were held in 1960 when John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon squared off on television four times. It took another 16 years for the practice to resume when Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford debated at the Walnut Street Theater in Philadelphia.\n\nSince then, nominated major party presidential candidates have debated on live television and other media formats every four years. This year, the second 2024 presidential debate, between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, will be held at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, on Sept. 10, 2024.\n\nThat event is widely expected to have a large national viewing audience. In a 2016 Pew Research Center survey, about 63 percent of prospective voters felt the presidential debates were helpful in deciding which candidate to vote for. The Center said those numbers were similar to past survey results about the impact of the debates on voter decisions.\n\nThe Era Before Presidential Debates\n\nPolitical debates before the era of television did occur, and perhaps the most noteworthy was the series of public debates in 1858 between two future presidential candidates: Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas.\n\nDuring the seven Lincoln-Douglas debates for a U.S. Senate seat in Illinois, the first speaker talked for one hour, followed by a 90-minute rebuttal from the second speaker, and a 30-minute closing statement from the first speaker. Some of the Lincoln-Douglas debates had more than 10,000 people in the audience, as the two men argued their positions.\n\nIn the 1920s, the advent of radio made political debates broadcast to the masses a real possibility, but the prospect was controversial. Congress passed the Communications Act of 1934; its Section 315 required that broadcasters who allowed political candidates to speak give an equal amount of speaking time to all of their legally qualified opponents, including minor-party candidates. The equal time rule inhibited debates with more than two candidates until 1976, with some exceptions. Congress could suspend the Section 315 requirement if asked by the candidates.\n\nIn 1940, Republican presidential candidate Wendell Willkie challenged his opponent, incumbent President Franklin D. Roosevelt, to several radio debates. Roosevelt declined the offers, citing scheduling conflicts or his need to concentrate on his presidential role as World War II unfolded. In 1948, Republican primary candidates Thomas Dewey and Harold Stassen took part in a radio debate during the Oregon primary. The Dewey-Stassen contest was limited to one question: Should the Communist Party be outlawed in the United States?\n\nIn 1956, Democratic contenders Adlai Stevenson and Estes Kefauver debated on live television during the Florida primary. And during the general election, two proxies for Stevenson and President Dwight Eisenhower took part in a live edition of the television show \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d Eleanor Roosevelt advocated for Stevenson as president and Sen. Margaret Chase Smith argued the case of the Eisenhower campaign.\n\nIn 1960, Congress waived Section 315 to allow the first national broadcast debates between two major party nominees: John F. Kennedy and Vice President Richard Nixon. The four televised debates became the templates for future presidential debates, and they showcased the power of television to influence elections.\n\nThe Kennedy-Nixon debates were watched live by as many as 70 million Americans. They also gave many potential voters their first chance to see actual presidential candidates in a live environment, as potential leaders.\n\nIn 1975, the Federal Communications Commission ruled that public debates that were broadcast in full, and not sponsored by the candidates or their supporters, were exempt from the equal time rule as on-the-spot news coverage. The FCC\u2019s decision allowed for presidential debates that featured leading candidates as picked by the debate organizers, removing the logistical issues involved with many candidates on the debate floor.\n\nThe Modern Era of Presidential Debates\n\nUnder the new FCC rules, the League of Women Voters sponsored the presidential debates between 1976 and 1984. Incumbent President Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter agreed to three debates, and the vice presidential candidates also were scheduled for one debate. The only debate in 1980 between President Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan drew 80 million live viewers, which was the most-viewed event during the League of Women Voters era.\n\nIn 1987, the two parties agreed to support a bipartisan non-profit, the Commission on Presidential Debates, to organize and run debates between the leading candidates for president and vice president. The commission was funded by independent donors and not by political parties.\n\nIn 1992, the commission include a third candidate, Ross Perot, in its sponsored debates after Perot\u2019s strong performance in popular polling. However, in 1996, Perot and Dr. John Hagelin, the nominee of another third party, sued the commission when it excluded them from the general election debates after a rules change.\n\nIn Perot v. Federal Election Commission (1996), the U.S. District for the District of Columbia Appeals Court ruled against Perot and Hagelin. In a per curiam opinion, the three judges said the commission had the right to exclude other candidates it determined had no \u201crealistic chance of winning\u201d the 1996 election. It also upheld a lower court ruling that the commission was not a state actor and could not violate the candidates\u2019 First Amendment rights.\n\nDuring the commission\u2019s era, the presidential debates were conducted with live audiences. In recent years, the first Hillary Clinton-Donald Trump debate in 2016 drew 84 million viewers and first Joe Biden-Trump 2020 debate had 73 million viewers, according to the commission.\n\nIn 2024, the leading candidates, Biden and Trump, decided to bypass the commission as the debate organizers and work with selected television networks. The commission announced in June 2024 that it was officially cancelling four debates it had scheduled.\n\nOn June 27, 2024, Biden and Trump debated in an event in Atlanta sponsored by CNN with 51.3 million viewers. After that debate, Biden announced on July 21, 2004 that he was not running for re-election. The first debate between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris is scheduled for Sept. 10, 2024, at the National Constitution Center and is sponsored by ABC News. Also, the vice presidential candidates, JD Vance and Tim Walz, are scheduled to debate on CBS in New York City on Oct. 1, 2024. Other debates could be scheduled during the election cycle.\n\nScott Bomboy is the editor in chief of the National Constitution Center.",

Stone, revealed that his Hotmail and Gmail accounts had been compromised. That intrusion evidently allowed Iranian hackers to impersonate him and gain access to the emails of campaign aides.\n\nThe announcement was the starkest indication to date that foreign intelligence organizations have mobilized to interfere in the 2024 election at a moment of heightened partisan polarization at home and escalating tensions abroad between Iran and Israel, along with its international allies, including the United States.\n\n\u201cIran seeks to stoke discord and undermine confidence in our democratic institutions,\u201d intelligence officials wrote in a joint statement from the F.B.I., the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.",

We thought, maybe this is the end,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe were in a helicopter going to a certain location together, and there was an emergency landing.\u201d\n\nNot long after Trump had finished speaking, Brown rubbished every single aspect of his story from the helicopter ride together to him criticizing Harris.\n\nNow, Brown has said he might sue the former president over the allegedly false story because \u201csomebody has got to make sure that he stops lying.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he keeps it up, at some point, I\u2019m going to give him a taste of his own conduct,\u201d Brown told CBS News. \u201cIf he sues The New York Times for printing that I said he lied, I\u2019m going to sue him.\u201d\n\nHarris arrives in Pittsburgh\n\nSunday 18 August 2024 18:23 , Ariana Baio\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has arrived in Pittsburgh to embark on her bus tour around Allegheny County before heading to the DNC.\n\nA small crowd of supporters have been waiting for Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz, to arrive in the Keystone State.

        "text": "Lindsey Graham warns Trump \u2018the provocateur\u2019 in danger of losing election\nThe Republican senator and Donald Trump loyalist Lindsey Graham has warned that Trump is in danger of losing the US presidential election if he continues to talk about Kamala Harris\u2019s race and make other personal attacks instead of focusing on policy issues.\n\nGraham\u2019s comments came on Meet The Press when asked whether he agreed with Nikki Haley\u2019s recent admonition that Trump and Republicans should \u201cquit whining\u201d and stop \u201ctalking about what race Kamala Harris is\u201d.\n\n\u201cYeah. I don\u2019t think \u2013 I don\u2019t look at vice-president Kamala Harris as a lunatic,\u201d Graham told moderator Kristin Welker. \u201cI look at her as the most liberal person to be nominated for president in the history of the United States.\u201d\n\nHe said the election should be fought on policy. \u201cA nightmare for Harris is to defend her policy choices,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump can win this election,\u201d Graham continued. \u201cIf you have a policy debate, he wins. Donald Trump the provocateur, the showman, may not win this election.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s ad hominem digs against Harris have ranged from disparaging and false comments about her race and intelligence to snide remarks about her appearance. During a Saturday rally Trump said: \u201cI\u2019m a better looking person than Kamala\u201d and that Harris had \u201cthe laugh of a crazy person\u201d.\n\nWith Harris rising in the polls many saw Trump\u2019s rally, in the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania, as an opportunity for him to reboot his campaign by focusing on issues of importance to voters, but he has instead continued to emphasize personal differences.\n\nTrump has repeatedly questioned the racial identity of Harris, whose mother is Indian and father is Jamaican. In a chaotic appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists several weeks ago, Trump incorrectly claimed that Harris suddenly \u201cbecame a Black woman\u201d and falsely stated that she had only identified with her Indian background.\n\n\u201cIs she Indian or is she Black?\u201d Trump remarked, prompting audible gasps. \u201cI respect either one, but she obviously doesn\u2019t because she was Indian all the way and then all of sudden she became a Black woman.\u201d\n\nHarris on Sunday suggested without naming him directly that Trump\u2019s habit of constantly attacking opponents made him a \u201ccoward\u201d.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When what we know is the real and true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up,\u201d Harris said at a campaign appearance in Pennsylvania. \u201cAnybody who\u2019s about beating down other people is a coward.\u201d\n\nJD Vance, Trump\u2019s vice-presidential candidate, has previously described Harris as a coward, too, in keeping with his running mate\u2019s personal attacks on her.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump walked right into the NABJ conference and showed he had the courage to take tough questions, while Kamala Harris continues to hide from any scrutiny or unfriendly media like the coward she is,\u201d Vance wrote last month.",

        "text": "The evolution of Kamala Harris: from activist in pigtails to presidential candidate\nView image in fullscreen Illustration: Samuel Kerr/The Guardian\n\nIt was the first week of July. News of the presidential election had been mired, for eight days, in alarming assessments of Joe Biden and that shambolic debate. The president had started but not finished sentences, slurred words and at points stood with his mouth slightly agape while his opponent, Donald Trump, ignored questions and lied without fact-check.\n\nNow, on 6 July, inside New Orleans\u2019s convention center, the 30th annual Essence Festival of Culture was under way. Kamala Harris was set to speak, one of the vice-president\u2019s biggest in-person events since Biden\u2019s performance had seemingly upended the race. The attendees \u2013 mostly Black women, drawn to this long-running music-festival-meets-women\u2019s-expo \u2013 were waiting to see Harris. Some were chattering about the possibilities: did her future lie at the top of the Democratic party\u2019s ticket? What could, or should, happen next? The press corps now trailing Harris had swelled in size, and began to scribble notes and scramble for a look as Harris walked across the stage as the defiant second chorus of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Freedom boomed. A rousing cheer came from the standing-room-only crowd in the cavernous, 600-seat room.\n\n\u201cWho is Kamala Harris?\u201d Caroline Wanga, the CEO and president of Essence Ventures asked, as she began a \u201cChief to Chief\u201d conversation, the live version of an interview published each month in Essence, the Black women\u2019s magazine. The conversations are supposed to illuminate what makes the subjects human, their struggles and lessons learned, the moments of victory and defeat and what distinguishes Black women who lead.\n\n\u201cThe vice-president of the United States,\u201d Harris responded, setting off another extended cheer from the crowd. \u201cI am a wife. We have children. I am a god-mommy. I am an auntie. I am a best friend. I am a good cook \u2026 and you know, I am a fighter for people. I am prepared to fight.\u201d\n\nUntil late July, Harris had been the running mate of the oldest man to seek the presidency. Today, Harris, the nation\u2019s first Black and south Asian and female vice-president, who was once characterized as a public official struggling to find her footing, is a presidential candidate with a narrow lead. When the big change happened \u2013 not by death but by swelling doubt \u2013 Harris appeared to have surprised all but those who have long known her.\n\nPeople who know Harris well say what the US is witnessing is the confidence, charisma and net effect of practical experience at multiple levels of government, a woman raised to work hard, to operate with compassion and to push past the comfortable toward what is necessary and right. That\u2019s always been there, but it was, perhaps, not always grasped by the public or press. Harris, friends and mentors say, was subjected to constant and unusual forms of scrutiny and given a series of particularly complex, intractable tasks that no one could wrap in a single term as vice-president.\n\nWhat is indisputable is that Harris is a woman running for the nation\u2019s highest office at a moment when democracy is at stake. Her candidacy is historic, and the next few weeks leading up to the presidential election will alter the course of American politics for better or worse.\n\n\u2018She was at marches in a stroller\u2019\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s always been a go-getter,\u201d said Areva Martin, a CNN legal analyst and lawyer who first met Harris in the late 1980s. Martin, then a student at the University of Chicago, was visiting her brother, a student at Howard University in Washington DC, where Harris was also enrolled, when the two first connected. The women hit it off and have remained friends. \u201cShe\u2019s always had a lot of confidence and a concept that anything that wasn\u2019t right, that wasn\u2019t working, was hers to try and change,\u201d Martin said. \u201cIf you hear her talking about growing up with her parents, who were very active in the civil rights movement, it\u2019s in her DNA. She was at marches in a stroller.\u201d\n\nBorn in October 1964, Harris is the daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother who met as graduate students at the University of California, Berkeley. The Harrises were committed civil rights activists during a time of radical political thought and activity and also, respectively, an economist and a breast cancer researcher. Harris was a toddler when Donald Harris\u2019s academic career forced the family to decamp to Illinois, where Harris\u2019s younger sister, Maya, was born. When Harris\u2019s parents split up in the early 1970s, Harris\u2019s mother, Shyamala Gopalan, moved Kamala and Maya back to Berkeley. The girls were raised with direct engagement with two cultures and a firm grounding in the realities of race in the United States. There were trips to an area Hindu temple, and lots of south Indian food which, with a few spice changes, Gopalan would often make into soul food.\n\nAt home, there were ample amounts of gospel music, which Gopalan, a singer, loved. The Harris girls also went with a neighbor to a Black church and sang in the children\u2019s choir. During summers with their dad, there was lots of jazz. Gopalan, for her part, counted writers and activists among her closest friends. \u201cMy mother understood very well that she was raising two Black daughters,\u201d Harris wrote in her 2019 book, The Truths We Hold. \u201cShe knew that her adopted homeland would see Maya and me as Black girls and she was determined to make sure that we would grow into confident, proud Black women.\u201d (Harris\u2019s staff declined to make Harris available for this story.)\n\nView image in fullscreen Harris arrives at the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, on 3 March 2024. Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nGopalan and the girls lived in a Black neighborhood, and the children were bussed along with other Black students to a white school in another part of town as part of the school district\u2019s integration plan. Harris was a civil rights foot soldier in pigtails. Later, at Howard University \u2013 widely considered the nation\u2019s premier institution of all the historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) \u2013 Harris encountered so many Black people with different interests, class backgrounds, experiences and cultures that, she wrote in her book, she felt like she was in heaven. She was one of at least two Kamalas on campus.\n\nHarris, then fond of popped collars and her short natural curls, studied political science and economics. Yearbooks show she was active in the California Student Association and the debate team and chaired the economics society. It was at Howard where she ran for her first office: freshman class representative. She had a summer gig at McDonald\u2019s, as well as internships with a US senator and at the Federal Trade Commission. At the National Archives, where the original Declaration of Independence, constitution and Bill of Rights as well as every administration\u2019s papers are held, the country\u2019s future first female vice-president was on research. And while working as a tour guide at the US Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Harris got her first official code name: \u201cTG-10\u201d for \u201ctour guide No 10\u201d.\n\nThen there was Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc, one of the nine Black sororities and fraternities, which Harris joined while she was an undergraduate. The groups were founded during the early 20th century so that a select group of college-educated Black Americans might have networks through which they could access jobs, loans, business deals, healthcare and even a safe place to stay. The Divine Nine, as the collective is called, were countervailing forces in a segregated country where the social order planted white Americans at the top and was often enforced by violence.\n\nBeing an AKA has been a way for Harris to embrace self-affirming merriment and matters of global significance. \u201cOn Fridays, my friends and I would dress up in our best clothes and peacock around the Yard,\u201d she wrote in her book. \u201cOn weekends, we went down to the National Mall to protest apartheid in South Africa.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just always been a force,\u201d said Inez Brown, who pledged AKA with Harris in the spring of 1986. \u201cI always said, Kamala is going to be a supreme court justice, because once I knew she was headed for law school, I was like she is going to do something really different. That was just her energy.\u201d\n\nWhen Maya gave birth to a daughter at 17, Harris went back home to California for law school, opting for the state university system\u2019s oldest law school, then known as the University of California, Hastings College of the Law (or UC Hastings, now UC Law San Francisco). When Harris was a student there, she and her mother helped to care for her niece, so that Maya could graduate from the University of California, Berkeley and then Stanford Law School on time.\n\nIn law school, Harris led the Black Law Students Association and was among an early, small group of Black students who spoke of wanting to become prosecutors, said Shauna Marshall, a semi-retired professor at the law school and co-director of its Center for Racial and Economic Justice. Marshall has known Harris since the early 1990s. While Harris was in law school, she and a few other students had begun to understand a district attorney\u2019s powerful decision-making authority \u2013 who should be charged, if at all, with what, and how long a judge should be asked to jail those convicted \u2013 and wanted it applied more fairly.\n\n\u201cI think both of their career choices came directly from their mother\u2019s activism,\u201d Marshall said about the Harris sisters.\n\nIn 1988, Harris took an internship in the Alameda county district attorney\u2019s office, the place where the supreme court justice Earl Warren \u2013 a chief justice whose court transformed the nation, vastly expanding civil rights and liberties to millions of Americans \u2013 had been chief prosecutor. She was one of a handful of Black lawyers in the office. It was the height of the crack epidemic, and Harris managed to convince a court to free a woman wrongly arrested in a drug raid. But, like 40% of people who took the California bar exam the next summer, Harris failed. She passed on her second try in 1990 and joined the Alameda prosecutor\u2019s staff, specializing in the prosecution of sex crimes.\n\nIn a 2019 speech, Harris told the South Carolina NAACP that when it was time to decide what type of lawyer she would be, her family gathered for a conversation. They wanted to know: \u201cKamala, what are you going to do in your fight for justice?\u201d Explaining why she wanted to be a prosecutor to that group was a bit like defending a thesis, she said.\n\n\u201cI know and I knew then prosecutors have not always done the work of justice,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThere have been prosecutors who refused to seat Black jurors, refused to prosecute lynchings, disproportionately condemned Black men to death row and looked the other way in the face of police brutality.\u201d But, Harris said, like other lawyers she admired, she decided to \u201cbelieve in what can be, unburdened by what has been\u201d.\n\nThere have been moments that convinced her it was the right choice. Once inside the Alameda county prosecutor\u2019s office, Harris was one of a handful of Black prosecutors. One day, she overheard white colleagues chatting in the hall about how to prove that defendants had been in gangs to apply longer sentences. The conversation was riddled with assumptions and stereotypes. One person suggested looking at the person\u2019s neighborhood. Another suggested the truth was in a defendant\u2019s clothes or music. Harris interrupted: the neighborhood they had discussed was one where she had friends and family. The clothes they described were considered stylish. The music, well, she had that on a tape in her car outside.\n\nFrom district attorney to state attorney general\n\nAfter nearly a decade, Harris was recruited to run the career criminal unit in the San Francisco district attorney\u2019s office, focused on violent and repeat criminals, and was responsible for many of the cases whose outcomes were shaped by California\u2019s contribution to the \u201ctough on crime\u201d era \u2013 actions states were incentivized to take under a 1994 federal crime bill brokered by then senator Joe Biden.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s \u201cthree strikes\u201d law and federal money to build more prisons made anyone convicted of three felony crimes, even non-violent offenses, eligible for a life sentence. Harris was among those in the San Francisco district attorney\u2019s office who pushed the agency to seek third-strike treatment only if the felonies involved were serious or violent crimes. But the issue and the racial disparities it deepened were bigger than any one prosecutor or DAs office. Today, the Vera Institute for Justice describes California as \u201cone of the epicenters of mass incarceration in the United States, incarcerating more people than any other state except Texas\u201d.\n\nHarris lasted in the San Francisco career criminal division for 18 months before San Francisco\u2019s city attorney called. She wanted Harris to come work on child welfare cases. Harris took the job with a condition: she would do court work and policy.\n\n\u201cThe work was meaningful, empowering and ... [i]t also boosted my confidence that when I saw problems, I could be the one to help devise the solutions,\u201d Harris wrote in her book. \u201cAll those times my mother had pressed me \u2013 \u2018Well, what did you do?\u2019 \u2013 suddenly made a lot more sense.\u201d\n\nThe experience was instructive. Harris, prompted by a friend she had met while serving on a non-profit board, ran for San Francisco district attorney. She defeated the incumbent, her old boss, and became the first person of color or woman to serve as district attorney. She was one of three elected Black district attorneys in the entire country.\n\nJust two years into her first term, Harris launched what was then a rare program, Back on Track, wherein first-time defendants aged 18-30 would plead guilty to non-violent crimes \u2013 and in exchange for getting a job or going to school, performing community service and making use of social workers, see their records expunged. Most years during the rest of Harris\u2019s tenure, the program enrolled 100 or fewer participants, according to district attorney office data. But, only 10% of participants wound up back in the criminal justice system, compared to about half of otherwise comparable defendants in California. The program was evidence that Harris was trying to make good on the logic that had driven the decision to become a prosecutor, said Marshall, who served on the program\u2019s advisory committee.\n\nThe push and pull between being an insider who wants to change a troubled system, and working inside a system that has helped to sustain American racial inequality created tension for Harris after she ran for and won the California attorney general\u2019s office in 2010, another role once held by Warren.\n\nIn the attorney general\u2019s office, Harris found herself defending the decisions of what she described as her clients \u2013 state agencies \u2013 in court. In 2011, that included the corrections department\u2019s decision not to release all prisoners as per a US supreme court order, after evidence of malnutrition and dangerous levels of overcrowding were found in California\u2019s prisons. Governing magazine found that California finally met the court\u2019s mandates in 2015, while Harris was attorney general. What made the difference: voters approved measures reducing the punishment for a number of crimes, prompting prison populations to fall.\n\nView image in fullscreen Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, depart from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, earlier this month. Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n\nCritics also often point to Harris\u2019s belief that lives could be saved by disrupting the link between truancy and crime. In San Francisco, Harris\u2019s team had discovered that many children missed school not because of their families\u2019 views about education but because they had significant family problems such as no home, no clean clothes, or they needed to babysit an ill sibling so that parents would not miss work. So, they offered these families services that cut truancy by 23% in two years, according to San Francisco school district data reported by the attorney general\u2019s office. But even in this system, some parents were hit with misdemeanor criminal charges, fines and other deterrent measures.\n\nAnthony Rackauckas Jr, a \u201claw and order\u201d tough-on-crime district attorney in southern California, used the state truancy law that Harris had championed to have a number of parents, many of them Black, Latino or caring for disabled children, arrested. Harris bore much of the public blame. The law remains in place, as do real differences in the way some district attorneys apply it.\n\nIn a 2019 interview with HuffPost, Jeff Adachi, a former chief public defender of San Francisco, said: \u201cI think it was a good thing that [Harris] shined a light on [truancy]. There is a correlation between children who fail at school and what happens later in life. [But] the idea of locking parents up, or citing them with a crime because they\u2019re not taking their children to school \u2013 it doesn\u2019t address the root of the problem.\u201d\n\nMeeting Doug Emhoff\n\nIn 2014, at 49, Harris got married for the first time. Harris met Douglas Emhoff, a California lawyer, on a blind date set up by Harris\u2019s best friend. The connection came with habit-aware instructions: you are going on a date. Do not Google him in advance. You will give him a chance. Harris has said she abided by two of the three.\n\nHarris discovered that she liked Emhoff almost immediately, she wrote in her book. Emhoff has said that he too was instantly smitten. So, when Harris warned him on that first date that she was a very busy woman, Emhoff went home and emailed a list of dates when he was available for the next few months. People around her noticed the difference Emhoff made.\n\n\u201cThey would later refer to that era as \u2018AD \u2013 After Doug\u2019,\u201d Harris wrote. \u201cThey loved how much he made me laugh. I did too.\u201d\n\nAt their August wedding, officiated by Harris\u2019s sister, Harris put a flower garland around Emhoff\u2019s neck, a traditional Indian wedding practice, and he stomped on a covered glass, a Jewish wedding tradition. Harris really liked Emhoff\u2019s kids: his son, Cole, and daughter, Ella, named after John Coltrane and Ella Fitzgerald. Harris instituted a tradition of sit-down Sunday dinners with her new family. Cooking together and talking in the kitchen, Harris has said, features prominently in her memories of her own mother, who died of cancer in 2009.\n\nHarris and Emhoff were still newlyweds when the US senator Barbara Boxer, a Democrat from California, announced that she would not seek a sixth term in January 2015. One week later, Harris was in the Senate race. Joe Biden, then the vice-president, swore her into office.\n\nFamily and lots of friends, including Brown and several more of Harris\u2019s AKA sisters, watched Harris become the first Black senator from California and the only Black woman in the US Senate. In fact, Harris was only the second Black woman to become a senator in the US and the first woman of south Asian descent to do so.\n\nWhite House ambitions\n\nWhen Harris decided to launch a 2020 bid for the White House, she\u2019d been in the Senate about three years. Harris had sponsored 164 bills and/or co-sponsored another 1,197. (Twenty-five have since become law, according to federal records.) As a member of the Senate judiciary committee, she had grilled some witnesses \u2013 Brett Kavanaugh, the future supreme court justice among them \u2013 in ways that had, for a time, captured the country\u2019s attention.\n\nBut, her 2020 presidential campaign never seemed to gain momentum under the weight of the widespread condemnation of the American criminal justice system that peaked after the murder of George Floyd.\n\nThe most significant moment of the short-lived campaign probably came on a primary debate stage. Harris asked Biden to acknowledge that during his long tenure in the Senate, his work with avowed segregationists to stymie federal funding that would have facilitated more busing to integrate schools had been wrong. One of those children to whom bussing had brought opportunities, Harris said on stage, \u201cwas me\u201d.\n\nView image in fullscreen Harris and Biden in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington DC last year. Photograph: Michael Reynolds/EPA/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nBut just as the broader culture was undergoing an alleged racial reckoning, similar discussions were happening inside politics. Biden wasn\u2019t the only white power player already well over 70 and going nowhere. Black women, long the backbone of the Democratic party\u2019s voter and organizing base remained scarce in senior positions. Outside consultants and party officials often spent money and political capital in the pursuit of white swing voters, a relatively small group. So, when decisions were being made, when policy priorities were being set, few Black women, and few people born after the July 1964 Civil Rights Act, for that matter, were in those rooms. There was a sense that a debt was owed, the bill was due.\n\nPolitical leaders like Karen Finney, a political strategist and former spokesperson for the 2016 Hillary Clinton campaign, and communications director at the Democratic National Committee; Glynda Carr, president and CEO of Higher Heights for America, which works to grow Black women\u2019s political power; Donna Brazile, a political strategist, two-time chair of the Democratic party and the first Black woman to run a presidential campaign; and Minyon Moore, a former Clinton administration official and political consultant, now serving as chair of the 2024 party convention, began to talk about the fact that there were Black women qualified for the vice-president\u2019s job and they should be considered, Finney said.\n\nTheir recommendation \u2013 made in a Zoom meeting with Biden and his team \u2013 was Harris.\n\nWhen the story is told by Harris\u2019s opponents, she is the typecasted VP, someone selected in a process that didn\u2019t start with r\u00e9sum\u00e9s or even political calculus. In reality, just about every vice-president was picked much the same way. Only, time and time again, no Black women had been considered.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a political strategy on the part of the Republican party to undermine [Harris] and to undermine her qualifications,\u201d Finney said. \u201cAnd unfortunately ... this is a very typical playbook that\u2019s often used.\u201d\n\nWomen\u2019s issues? \u2018Oh, you mean the economy\u2019\n\nIn the White House, Biden gave Harris early tasks which, at minimum, must be described as hard. Chief among them: identifying and helping the administration to address the root causes of the increase in undocumented immigration. Getting to the root causes and their solutions by traveling to Guatemala and Mexico was never going to generate photos of Harris hanging out of the top of a tank or standing at the border with a bullhorn. That really wasn\u2019t Harris\u2019s style or the nature of her assignment, either.\n\nHarris didn\u2019t stave off the critics. During a sit-down interview, Harris laughed when Lester Holt, the NBC Nightly News anchor, asked when she would visit the US-Mexico border. The causes of illegal immigration don\u2019t begin within a few feet of the Rio Grande and she hadn\u2019t personally visited Europe either, she responded, saying no one was accusing her of ignoring or avoiding issues there. Republican officials pounced. There was, in Trump\u2019s view, an \u201cinvasion\u201d at the border. And many Democrats weren\u2019t happy with a directive Harris issued to undocumented immigrants in a subsequent press conference: \u201cDon\u2019t come\u201d \u2013 seeking asylum at a US border crossing is a legal act.\n\n\u201cWe had never had a Black female vice-president,\u201d said Finney. \u201cShe was basically doing the job in her own way but it\u2019s a role that was created for white men. So of course she\u2019s not going to be doing it in the same way all the men before her did it.\u201d\n\nThe rest of Harris\u2019s portfolio has been largely complicated or long-running matters of domestic concern including gun violence, barriers to entrepreneurship and full economic inclusion for all Americans, maternal healthcare and \u201cgender policy\u201d. Harris has said that when people ask her to talk about \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d, she often replies: \u201cOh, you mean the economy.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Harris after a tour of the US Customs and Border Protection Central Processing Center in El Paso, Texas, in 2021. Photograph: Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n\nAs vice-president in Washington, Harris cast 33 tie-breaking votes in the US Senate, many to complete or move forward Biden\u2019s nominees for various senior-level federal jobs. She also broke ties more than any other vice-president in history. And she has become the administration\u2019s foremost voice on abortion access.\n\nShe spoke about it in ways that many who weren\u2019t in the meetings on other issues or working in the vice-president\u2019s office began to notice in March when Harris became the first vice-president to visit a healthcare facility offering abortions in St Paul, Minnesota. There, Harris discussed women\u2019s healthcare and the situation emerging in states that have banned abortions, and warned reporters and others there to brace themselves because she was going to use anatomically correct terms and use the \u201cbouquet of microphones\u201d to share women\u2019s experiences. Tim Walz, the governor, was standing right behind her.\n\n\u201cWhen she was given the roles ... then she was able to speak, and she did so very confidently, very boldly,\u201d said Christian Nunes, president of the National Organization for Women (NOW).\n\nThe birth of the Harris campaign\n\nOn 21 July, Harris\u2019s campaign filed paperwork only hours after Biden\u2019s announcement, making her an official candidate for the White House. By that evening, it was clear: this was different.\n\nMore than 40,000 Black women gathered for a Zoom meeting that night to recognize the significance of the moment, raise money and start organizing. The volume of interest required an exception to Zoom\u2019s virtual meeting size limits, and $1.6m was raised in a few hours. The concept of extremely frank, in-group conversations \u2013 about this moment and the specific responses different groups of voters could have, and the stakes they should contemplate \u2013 gained traction. White Dudes for Harris, Black Men for Harris, Evangelicals for Harris and Republicans for Harris have gathered in the weeks since.\n\nOne participant in the estimated 160,000-person white women\u2019s Zoom said every woman and girl in the country faced real threats under a possible second Trump administration, including a loss of control over their bodies and, with that, their lives. \u201cYour whiteness,\u201d one woman in the same Zoom meeting said, \u201cwill not save you.\u201d At the same time, over on social media, Kamala was chartreuse green; Kamala was brat. Supercuts of Kamala captured her dancing with marching bands and confidently delivering lacerating, pro-Harris assessments of Trump, some of them backed by the sound of Kendrick Lamar\u2019s Not Like Us and Chappell Roan\u2019s Femininomenon.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t buy that,\u201d said Cornell Belcher, a pollster and founder of the political strategy firm Brilliant Corners who knows Harris and may be best known for his work on the Obama campaigns. \u201cThat\u2019s worth hundreds of millions of dollars and it has to happen organically.\u201d\n\nFour days after Harris declared herself a candidate for the presidency, she was in Indianapolis, inside the Indiana convention center to address more than 6,000 members of the Zeta Phi Beta Sorority Inc, another member of the Divine Nine.\n\n\u201cIn this moment,\u201d Harris told the people seated at a sea of round tables before her, \u201cI believe that we face a choice between two different visions for our nation, one focused on the future and the other focused on the past. And with your support, I am fighting for our nation\u2019s future.\u201d\n\n\u201cRecognize there are those who are trying to take us back,\u201d Harris continued. \u201cBut we are not going back.\u201d\n\nIt was the birth of the Harris campaign.",

        "text": "Astrology and 2024 US elections: How Trump's Gemini and Harris' Libra shape voter perceptions\nDonald Trump and Kamala Harris\n\nAstrological forecasts for Trump and Harris\n\nPluto return and its implications\n\nHistorical context and modern reflections\n\nAs the 2024 presidential election looms, astrological predictions are gaining traction among voters seeking guidance in a polarized political climate. The stars are aligning in intriguing ways for both major candidates : Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.While predictions remain speculative, the alignment of the stars provides both comfort and intrigue to many voters.Astrologers are closely analyzing the charts of both candidates to forecast the election's outcome. Trump, with his Gemini Sun, Leo Rising, and Sagittarius Moon, is experiencing what some astrologers describe as \u201clucky energy\u201d this year. However, this does not guarantee a straightforward path to victory. His astrological profile has been a subject of significant interest, especially after surviving an assassination attempt and navigating legal troubles.Kamala Harris, with her Libra Sun, Gemini Rising, and Aries Moon, also has favorable astrological signs influencing her campaign. Astrologer Ren\u00e9\u00e9 Watt noted that Harris\u2019 chart is marked by promising alignments this year, which could signal a strong push in the election. Both candidates share a Gemini influence, suggesting that their campaigns might be particularly dynamic and subject to unexpected twists.A key astrological event this year is the United States' Pluto return, an event that occurs once every 200 years and symbolizes a period of significant transformation. Catherine Urban, an astrologer based in Cleveland, Ohio, suggested that this Pluto return indicates a \u201ccomplete breakdown of the system,\u201d reflecting deep political and societal changes. Trump\u2019s presidency in 2016 has been seen as a catalyst for this transformative period, while Harris\u2019 chart, with its alignment to the US Pluto, suggests she could play a crucial role in navigating this transition.Historically, astrology has influenced political strategy, from Roman emperors to Ronald Reagan, who consulted astrologer Joan Quigley to time his public appearances strategically. Today, astrologers like Lisa Stardust and Sarah Potter observe that astrology is serving as a tool for voters to find meaning and cope with election anxieties.\u201cPeople are looking for something other than graphs or polls,\u201d said Watt, reflecting the broader trend of seeking spiritual insight during politically turbulent times.",

        "text": "Kamala Harris and Tim Walz targeted by an unusually violent online smear campaign\nSupporters of Donald Trump at a rally in Asheville, North Carolina, August 14, 2024. GRANT BALDWIN / AFP\n\nThey say she isn't a real woman, she slept her way to the top or she's running a child trafficking network while taking orders from a globalist elite. And they say that for her running mate, she chose a supporter of the \"Great Replacement\" of the white population by the Black population, a defender of child sex offenders and even a zoophile.\n\nSince August 2, the date of her official nomination as the Democratic Party's candidate for the US presidential election to replace Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris has faced an unusually violent barrage mixing unabashed fake news, conspiracy theories and degrading attacks.\n\nSometimes a 'prostitute for globalists,' sometimes transgender\n\nHer primary fault? Being a woman. A number of pro-Trump activists have reasserted in recent weeks that the current vice president \"slept her way to the top,\" a nagging accusation for several years, to the point of becoming a meme. The more radical accuse Harris of being a \"prostitute for globalists\" (an elite supposedly in control of the world) who allegedly \"performed sexual services\" in order to make a name for herself.\n\nDonald Trump himself claimed that Willie Brown, former mayor of San Francisco and Harris' ex-boyfriend, confided \"terrible things\" to him about her during a hectic helicopter ride together \u2013 a flight that, according to Brown, never took place.\n\nAdded to these sexist attacks are transphobic rumors. The more conspiratorial fringes, close to the QAnon movement, claim that Harris is actually a man named Kamal Aroush. In 2023, a crease of a dress in an old photo was already being presented as \"proof\" that she'd had a penis in her youth. This slanderous behavior, typical of conspiracy-minded conservative circles, has also been targeted at Michelle Obama in the past, as well as Brigitte Macron in France.\n\nLike Barack Obama, she is said to be ineligible because of her foreign background\n\nOther typical far-right attacks target her foreign background. Harris, who could become the first US president of South Asian origin, is said to be ineligible, according to these detractors, because her parents are from Jamaica and India. Mike Engleman, a Trump supporter, insisted that she could not be elected because \"neither of her parents were natural born American citizens when she was born.\"\n\nYet this claim is incorrect: The US Constitution specifies that the president must be American-born, be at least 35 years old and have lived on national soil for 14 years, but has no requirements about parents.\n\nThe attack is reminiscent of the one that targeted Barack Obama. In 2009, the birthers, a far-right conspiracy community, accused America's first Black president of being of Kenyan nationality like his father, and not American like his mother, on the basis of a false article.\n\nFake images linking her to child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein\n\nAdded to these smear tactics about her gender and origins are the interminable accusations against the Democratic Party's supposed links with pedophile rings. In 2016, Trump's victorious campaign was marked by \"Pizzagate,\" a false scandal and real conspiracy theory involving Hillary Clinton and her campaign manager, John Podesta, with rumors of pedophile parties in the basement of a Washington pizzeria. On August 3, the pro-Trump gossip machine attempted to connect Harris to Pizzagate, with a host of convoluted links.\n\nAccusations of pedophilia are among the springs pro-Trump conspiracies draw from the most. Other rumors have circulated about links with a bogeyman of American public life, multibillionaire Jeffrey Epstein, who was prosecuted for sex trafficking of underage girls before his suicide in prison in 2019. In 2021, a photo, which was actually digitally altered, featured Harris on Epstein's arm. Since mid-July, it has been going around again.\n\nAnother viral image, generated by artificial intelligence, shows them as a couple on a beach. Such a method had already been used in an attempt to smear Biden. In recent years, the Democratic president had been associated with a fake list of visitors to Epstein's island, as well as with a neighboring island he allegedly owned. One of Trump's advisers, Stephen Miller, no stranger to false allegations, even claimed that \"Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are the number one traffickers of children, girls, into sex slavery on planet Earth.\"\n\nOn the opposite side, a few cases of anti-Trump manipulation\n\nIn response to these attacks, Harris' camp pointed out that numerous file photos, some authentic, show Trump in the company of Epstein. At the margin, a few rare pro-Harris forgeries have taken aim at Trump. A pro-Harris account called it \"repulsive\" that the former president's campaign had borrowed a plane once owned by the billionaire. It failed to mention, however, that Trump's team had fallen back on this aircraft after his personal plane was damaged and had no knowledge of the borrowed aircraft's history. More recently, images showing Trump in the company of underage girls have been circulating on social media: Generated by artificial intelligence, they do not constitute an authentic photo.\n\nThe wave of slander against Harris quickly spread to Tim Walz, whom she chose as her running mate on August 6. While he doesn't lend himself to sexist or racist attacks, this politician known for his rural roots has been targeted by sordid rumors of zoophilia. A rude satirical montage on the American social media platform Reddit launched the rumor that he had been hospitalized for drinking horse semen... a fabrication later supported by a fake local newspaper clipping.\n\nTim Walz, a 'zoophile' promoting the 'Great Replacement'\n\nOther fake news has accused him of having the Minnesota flag altered to resemble that of Somalia, in what would appear to be a promotion of the racist \"Great Replacement\" theory. \"Now he wants to do the same to our country,\" wrote Andrew Torba, co-founder of the far-right social media platform Gab. Walz, however, is not the designer of the new flag, which takes its inspiration from \"l'Etoile du Nord\" (\"The Star of the North\"), the nickname given to it by the French settlers who discovered this state and which has been its motto since 1858.\n\nAnother rumor insists that Walz signed a law protecting pedophiles. It's based on an actual law from 2023, the Take Pride Act, which opposes discrimination against LGBT+ people, but in no way concerns child sex offenders.\n\nIn a more classic vein, fake news is circulating that he is setting up a \"voter fraud\" scheme by issuing driver's licenses to undocumented migrants to enable them to vote \u2013 even though this status does not confer US citizenship, which is required for taking part in elections, as AFP Fact Check reports.\n\nIn recent days, Trump's side has also accused Harris and Walz of using artificial intelligence to make it look like a large crowd was waiting for them when they got off the plane at a rally in Detroit. Considering the violence of previous smears, this false information almost seems like a by-the-book attack.",

        "text": "US says Iran behind cyber attacks on Harris, Trump election campaigns\nIntelligence agencies accuse Iran of trying to create discord amid concern about foreign interference in November election.\n\nThe United States has accused Iran of launching cyber attacks on the presidential campaigns of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump and targeting US voters with influence operations designed to exacerbate political division.\n\nThe assessment from the FBI and other federal agencies marks the first time the US government has assigned blame amid renewed fears of the threat of foreign election interference in the country\u2019s election.\n\n\u201cWe have observed increasingly aggressive Iranian activity during this election cycle, specifically involving influence operations targeting the American public and cyber operations targeting presidential campaigns,\u201d the FBI, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which is responsible for the defence of US government computer systems, said in a statement on Monday.\n\n\u201cThis includes the recently reported activities to compromise former president Trump\u2019s campaign, which the [intelligence community] attributes to Iran,\u201d they said.\n\nThe Trump campaign accused Iran of hacking one of its websites earlier this month. At the time, Trump said Iran was \u201conly able to get publicly available information\u201d.\n\nIran, the US statement said, had also targeted the campaign of Harris, who will formally accept the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nomination at this week\u2019s convention.\n\nIran\u2019s mission to the United Nations issued a statement calling the allegations \u201cunsubstantiated and devoid of any standing\u201d and challenged Washington to release evidence for the claim.\n\n\u201cAs we have previously announced, the Islamic Republic of Iran harbours neither the intention nor the motive to interfere with the US presidential election,\u201d the mission said.\n\nThe US statement said the intelligence community was confident Iranian operatives using social engineering and other means \u201csought access to individuals with direct access to the presidential campaigns of both parties\u201d, the statement said.\n\nThose activities included thefts and disclosures \u201cintended to influence the US election process\u201d, the statement added, without elaborating.\n\nThe United States goes to the polls on November 5.\n\nGoogle said this month that hackers backed by Iran were targeting the Democratic and Republican presidential campaigns.\n\nA hacker group known as APT42 linked to Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps went after high-profile individuals and organisations in Israel and the United States, including government officials and political campaigns, Google said in a threat report.\n\nIn 2016, a hack of Democratic National Committee emails, blamed on Russian military intelligence, exposed internal party communications, including about candidate Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump, who went on to win the election, was criticised for encouraging the hack.\n\nThe latest hacking allegations come at a time of significant tensions between Washington and Tehran amid Israel\u2019s continuing war in Gaza.\n\nThe US agencies did not detail how they concluded that Iran was responsible, nor did they describe the nature of any information that may have been stolen from the Trump campaign.",

        "text": "Foreign Adversaries Are Targeting the 2024 Election\nMicrosoft released a report this month detailing efforts by Iran, Russia, and China to influence American voters ahead of the November election, divide the country, and even incite violence. The report describes a recent Iranian phishing attack targeting a presidential campaign. The day after its publication, former President Trump\u2019s campaign cited the report when announcing that its internal communications had been hacked. Days later, Vice President Harris\u2019s campaign disclosed that the FBI had notified it of a foreign influence operation targeting the campaign. Both announcements deservedly received ample media coverage.\n\nIn the midst of that coverage, however, the big-picture warnings from the Microsoft report may have been lost. The Iranian attack is but one of a range of large-scale efforts by foreign adversaries \u2014 specifically, Iran, Russia, and China \u2014 to amplify divisions within the United States and decrease Americans\u2019 confidence in our democracy.\n\nEfforts by actors linked to Iran include creating fake news websites containing incendiary messaging about polarizing topics, such as LGTBQ rights and the Israel-Hamas conflict. One site targets liberal audiences by mocking Trump. Another caters to conservatives, writing about Republican politics and critiques of gender-affirming care. Another actor with ties to Iran has employed tactics including impersonating activist groups to sow division and undermine confidence in government officials.\n\nThe report also details recent malign influence operations by Russia. One prominent actor uses video forgeries and fake journalist accounts to peddle false claims that are then bolstered on artificial news websites. These claims have often focused on decreasing trust in key government institutions, including conspiracies that the CIA and FBI are working to disrupt the election and spy on Trump.\n\nFinally, Microsoft reports that China, Russia\u2019s most important ally, is also working to amplify discord ahead of the 2024 election. In the spring, hundreds of fake accounts linked to China posted in support of pro-Palestine protests on U.S. college campuses and offered directions to nearby demonstrations. Another Chinese influence actor has released videos criticizing President Biden.\n\nThese findings are echoed in last month\u2019s election security update from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which highlighted, among other things, Russian plans to sway public opinion in swing states and Iranian actors\u2019 efforts to undermine confidence in U.S. institutions and fan existing tensions about the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nWhile Microsoft\u2019s report doesn\u2019t mention specific attacks against election infrastructure, these same adversaries have a history of targeting election infrastructure with cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns meant to cast doubt on election security.\n\nIn 2022, pro-Russian \u201chacktivists\u201d temporarily restricted access to a state election office website. Previously, Russia and Iran targeted several networks that manage election-related functions in 2020, while in 2016, Russia targeted both state systems and private election system vendors. Importantly, none of these efforts ultimately interfered with the voting process or materially affected the security of any election infrastructure, but they have been used by foreign and domestic actors to call into question the trustworthiness of elections.\n\nThese same adversaries have carried out disinformation campaigns about the security of American election infrastructure. For instance, in the days leading up to the November 2022 midterm elections, Iranian operatives fabricated a video depicting an Iranian \u201cwhistleblower\u201d hacking into a U.S. voter registration database. Russia has also focused on casting doubt on election integrity in recent years, including by spreading false information that President Biden lost the 2020 election as part of its strategy to undermine confidence in democracy.\n\nThese warnings from Microsoft underline how important it will be over the next several weeks for election officials and the media to highlight the greatly improved security of our election infrastructure in recent years. In particular, jurisdictions nationwide have increased the use of paper ballots, which cannot be hacked and are routinely audited after the election to confirm vote totals. This year, only about 1.4 percent of all votes will lack a paper backup, down significantly from nearly a quarter of all votes in 2016. Election officials in every swing state, and most other states, will audit those paper records to confirm the accuracy of the vote count.\n\nIn light of these attempts to influence voters of various political backgrounds, it is more critical than ever for the public to know where to find accurate voting information. When it comes to elections, election officials are the most authoritative source of information. Voters can turn to local and state election offices, including government websites, to ensure they have accurate information about how, when, and where to vote, as well as other important information about how elections work in their jurisdictions. Americans must also think critically about the information they consume and prioritize sources from legitimate news organizations with trained journalists and an editorial review process.",

        "text": "The 7 Biggest Landslides in US Presidential History\nSome might argue that George Washington should hold the record for the greatest margin of victory of any American president. In the very first presidential election in 1789, Washington won 100 percent of the electoral college\u2014all 69 votes. Washington had a distinct advantage, though. He ran unopposed.\n\nHere are seven landslide American presidential elections with the greatest margins of victory, ranked from smallest to largest.\n\n1. Lyndon Johnson vs. Barry Goldwater (1964)\n\nJohnson Buries Goldwater\n\nOn November 22, 1963, as the nation was still reeling from the shocking assassination of President John F. Kennedy in Dallas, Lyndon Johnson, Kennedy\u2019s vice president, took the oath of office on Air Force One with JFK's grieving widow by his side.\n\nWhen most historians write about Johnson, they focus on his controversial handling of the Vietnam War or his progressive civil rights agenda, but all of that came later, says historian and journalist Jonathan Darman.\n\n\u201cIf you think about the situation in late 1963 to mid-1964, the dominant image of Johnson Is someone who was a calming presence in this country after the trauma of the assassination,\u201d says Darman, author of Landslide: LBJ and Reagan at the Dawn of a New America. \u201cThere was a collective sense of relief in the country that he was able to step into the office and be a figure of comfort and stability.\u201d\n\nThe economy was strong in 1964 and the conflict in Vietnam was still in the back pages of the newspaper. The only thing that could have defeated Johnson in 1964 was a really compelling Republican opponent. Instead, the Republicans nominated Senator Barry Goldwater, a conservative hardliner.\n\n\u201cExtremism in the defense of liberty is no vice,\u201d declared Goldwater at the Republican National Convention.\n\nGoldwater didn\u2019t address civil rights, the most important issue of the day, but lectured his audiences about the sanctity of private property, minimal government, and law and order.\n\n\u201c[Goldwater\u2019s campaign] was almost designed to alienate voters,\u201d says historian and author David Pietrusza.\n\nJohnson cruised to a convincing landslide victory, winning 486 electoral votes to Goldwater\u2019s 52, an electoral margin of victory of 80.6 percentage points.\n\n2. Lincoln vs. McClellan (1864)\n\nThe 1864 election was held during some of the fiercest fighting of the Civil War with only the 25 states of the Union casting ballots. The presidential race became a national referendum on the war, with incumbent Abraham Lincoln promising to fight on, and Democratic challenger George McClellan saying it was time to make peace with the Confederacy.\n\nIn the 1860 election, Lincoln ran as a Republican, but four years later he cobbled together a coalition of pro-war Republicans and pro-war Democrats form the National Union party. Its slogan was \u201cDon\u2019t change horses in the middle of a stream,\u201d referring to the dangers of switching Union leadership in the middle of a war.\n\nMcClellan, a Union general, wasn\u2019t actually a peace candidate, but that\u2019s what the Democratic party chose as its platform. If the Union had continued to lose important battles to the Confederacy\u2014as it did throughout the summer of 1864\u2014McClellan and the Democrats may have won in a landslide. But when General Sherman took Atlanta in September, the tide of the war turned and the Republicans rode the good news into election day.\n\nLincoln won 212 electoral votes to McClellan\u2019s 12, a margin of victory of 81.6 percentage points.\n\n3. Reagan vs. Carter (1980)\n\nThe economic and political situation in 1980 was the polar opposite of 1964. In 1964, the economy was roaring and the nation voted for LBJ, the candidate who would ensure calm and continuity. In 1980, the nation was mired in a deep economic recession and 100 Americans were being held hostage in Iran with no resolution in sight. Voters were ready for a change in the White House.\n\n\u201cDistaste for the Carter presidency mounts and mounts in 1979 and 1980,\u201d says Darman. \u201cReagan\u2019s landslide victory in 1980 was in a lot of ways a consensus rejection of Carter more than it was a consensus affirmation of the Reagan program.\u201d\n\nRonald Reagan was no stranger to American voters in 1980. He was first elected governor of California in 1966 and ran a close Republican primary campaign against Gerald Ford in 1976. Darman says that by 1980, Reagan was \u201cthe dominant figure of the American right.\u201d\n\nStill, some voters going into the 1980 election thought Reagan\u2019s brand of conservatism was too extreme. But after some strong debate performances, Reagan made a case that he was a \u201ccredible, plausible, moderate-enough alternative to Carter,\u201d says Darman.\n\nReagan ended up trouncing the beleaguered Jimmy Carter by 81.8 percentage points, 489 electoral votes to 49.\n\n4. Jefferson vs. Pinckney (1804)\n\nThomas Jefferson had every reason to be confident going into his reelection campaign in 1804. The young nation was prospering and at peace, and Jefferson\u2019s political rivals, the Federalists, were in disarray. Jefferson was bold enough to predict that his Democratic-Republicans would only lose four states in 1804. They ended up taking all but two.\n\nAnother boon for Jefferson was a change of running mate. In 1800, Jefferson shared the ticket with Aaron Burr, but Burr lost favor with the Democratic-Republicans after he refused to bow out of a four-way electoral stalemate in 1800. In 1804, Jefferson dropped Burr and replaced him with New York governor George Clinton.\n\nThe Federalists briefly considered nominating Burr as their own candidate in 1804, but went with Charles Cotesworth Pinckney of South Carolina instead. Presidential candidates didn\u2019t openly campaign back then, but the Federalists tried to attack Jefferson on the foolishness of the Louisiana Purchase and his affairs with his enslaved mistress, Sally Hemings.\n\nJefferson ran on his record and coasted to a landslide victory, taking 162 electoral votes to Pinckney\u2019s 14, a margin of victory of 84 percentage points.\n\nThe 1804 election was the first to be held after the ratification of the 12th Amendment, which changed the electoral process so that each elector cast two separate votes: one for president and another for vice president.\n\n5. Nixon vs. McGovern (1972)\n\nMore than 50 years after the Watergate scandal and Richard Nixon\u2019s disgraced White House resignation, it\u2019s easy to forget that Nixon was once an incredibly popular president. Nixon\u2019s landslide victory in 1972 remains the largest popular vote margin in American electoral history, whipping his opponent George McGovern by nearly 18 million votes.\n\nFlashback: Nixon Accepts Nomination\n\nThe 1972 election was the first held after the ratification of the 26th Amendment, which lowered the voting age from 21 to 18. Young male voters, in particular, had good reason to vote for Nixon, who promised to end the Vietnam draft by December 1972. The president had already recalled 500,000 troops from Vietnam by 1972, which did much to quell anti-war protests.\n\nNixon\u2019s opponents, the Democrats, were still reeling from the disastrous 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, in which anti-war protestors clashed violently with police. In 1972, the fractured Democratic party chose Senator George McGovern from South Dakota, who ran as an anti-war candidate.\n\nThe Nixon campaign attacked McGovern as a left-wing extremist, and the McGovern campaign suffered a crippling setback when it was revealed that his running mate underwent electroshock therapy for depression.\n\nOn election day, not only did Nixon win a commanding 520 electoral votes to McGovern\u2019s 17 (a margin of 93.5 percentage points), but Nixon became the first Republican candidate to win every state in the South, historically a Democratic stronghold.\n\n6. Reagan vs. Mondale (1984)\n\nMorning in America\n\nIn 1984, President Ronald Reagan\u2019s reelection team ran a brilliant campaign ad called \u201cMorning in America.\u201d\n\n\u201cVoters understood it instantly,\u201d says Darman. \u201cThis idea that the U.S. had gone through several traumatic presidencies stretching back to Kennedy. And now, after the turbulent decades of 1960s and 1970s, Reagan\u2019s leadership had brought the nation new strength and stability.\u201d\n\nIn his first term in office, Reagan proved his critics wrong by presenting a \u201cworkable conservatism,\u201d says Darman, that was pro-business and pro free market, while pushing for lower taxes, smaller government and an assertive Cold War stance.\n\nThe Democrats nominated Walter Mondale, who served as vice president under Carter. In turn, Mondale chose congresswoman Geraldine Ferraro as his running mate, the very first woman on a major-party American presidential ticket.\n\nMondale briefly had Reagan on the ropes after a weak debate performance\u2014at the time, Reagan was 73, the oldest person to be nominated for president\u2014but in the end the Mondale campaign failed to provide a compelling alternative to Reagan\u2019s conservative vision.\n\nReagan improved on his impressive 1980 showing, absolutely crushing Mondale 525 electoral votes to 13. In 1984, Reagan took every state except Minnesota and the District of Columbia for an electoral margin of victory of 95.2 percentage points.\n\n7. Franklin D. Roosevelt vs. Alf Landon (1936)\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt was elected president a record four times\u2014this was before the 22nd Amendment established term limits\u2014and none of the races were terribly competitive. Even his smallest margin of victory in the electoral college was still 62.8 percentage points in 1944. His largest margin of victory\u2014the greatest landslide in American presidential history\u2014came in 1936 when he won by 97 percentage points.\n\nThe 1936 election was, in part, a referendum on FDR\u2019s sweeping New Deal legislation. But the New Deal wasn\u2019t an unqualified success in 1936, says Pietrusza, author of Roosevelt Sweeps Nation: FDR\u2019s 1936 Landslide and the Triumph of the Liberal Ideal. Unemployment was still high and the Supreme Court had struck down New Deal programs like the National Industrial Recovery Act and the Agricultural Adjustment Act.\n\nPietrusza credits Roosevelt\u2019s success to his political savvy. FDR was adept at reading the shifting political winds. He was quick to switch sides on an issue when it started to prove unpopular. For example, FDR started out as a supporter of Woodrow Wilson\u2019s League of Nations, but became a staunch isolationist by the 1930s. FDR was originally against some of his own trademark programs, like Social Security and tax reform, but changed his mind when they gained popularity.\n\n\u201cRoosevelt was a politician,\u201d says Pietrusza, \u201cand he was very, very good at it.\u201d\n\nAnother reason for FDR\u2019s dominating performance in the 1936 was the weakness of his opponent, Republican governor Alf Landon of Kansas.\n\n\u201cLandon had been a big fish in a small pond in Kansas,\u201d says Pietrusza, \u201cbut he turns out to be an abysmal speaker and really shoots himself in the foot on Social Security.\u201d\n\nAs the United States was still pulling itself out of the Great Depression, voters overwhelmingly chose to stick with FDR. Roosevelt won every state except for Vermont and Maine, collecting 523 electoral votes to Landon\u2019s eight.",

        "text": "Will social media polls accurately predict the winner of the U.S. presidential election?\nCommunication professor JungHwan Yang is a member of a research team that explored the biases associated with political polls posted on social media, how their results compare with those reported by mainstream media and their potential influence on public discourse.\n\n(Photo by L. Brian Stauffer.)\n\nJungHwan Yang, a professor of communication, is a co-principal investigator on a research project and a website \u2014 socialpolls.org \u2014 that examine the informal polls about the U.S. presidential election posted on the social media platform X, formerly called Twitter. Yang spoke with News Bureau research editor Sharita Forrest about the project.\n\nSocial media users may be exposed to numerous informal polls during the election. How much faith should they place in the results?\n\nWe examined nearly 2,000 polls posted on X that ostensibly gauged support for U.S. presidential candidates during the 2016 and 2020 elections.\n\nWhile social media polls appear like traditional opinion surveys, they are not accurate measures of public opinion. Instead, they are indicators of political engagement among specific subsets of the population and serve a distinct function.\n\nThis distinction is important because the observed opinions on social media are inherently biased.\n\nWhat are some of ways in which social media polls are biased?\n\nWe found that these polls are biased in terms of their content, authorship, and audience.\n\nFirst, they are not scientific. Traditional polls are carefully designed as to who is asked the questions and how the surveys are distributed. Social media polls are purely based on people\u2019s voluntary engagement because they are not asking questions of a representative sample of the electorate.\n\nFor example, if former President Donald Trump is posting a poll, it is very likely that his followers will vote rather than people who do not follow him.\n\nBased on certain events, the level of public engagement also can change drastically. For example, the failed assassination attempt on Trump could mobilize his supporters on a social media platform.\n\nSometimes the survey questions are biased. Creators do not ask the question in an objective way because they want a certain outcome.\n\nBy amplifying some negative aspects of a candidate, they can also skew the responses. For example, they might have asked, \u201cSince Joe Biden\u2019s cognitive health is deteriorating, who do you think the next president of the United States should be?\u201d\n\nAnd the inclusion of a third or fourth candidate in a multiple-choice format can change the results, as can the order of the questions and the responses.\n\nWhat have you found in your research about those who create these polls?\n\nWe scraped data from each poll\u2019s author profile as well as those of their followers. We collected all the profiles of poll authors and their followers who retweeted and tagged each poll as a favorite. Finally, we used machine learning algorithms coupled with human verification to identify these social media users\u2019 demographic and political characteristics.\n\nThe social media polls in the 2016 and 2020 election cycles were predominantly crafted by younger males. That said, polls won by Trump were more likely to be crafted by older users than polls won by Biden/Clinton.\n\nThose who post these social media polls control when they put them on sites and when they close the posts, giving them a lot of control over generating the results they want.\n\nYour study indicates that the creators of these polls purchase votes from bot farms overseas. How prevalent is that? And do social media companies \u2014 some of which claim they block false information \u2014 address it?\n\nIt is common to see social media polls accumulate thousands of votes very quickly.\n\nBot farms and astroturfing campaigns can create fake accounts that follow the instructions of the people who purchase their services. Bad actors who want a certain outcome can buy a lot of votes from bots. As far as we know, social media companies do not monitor these activities and are not transparent about the extent to which this occurs on their platforms.\n\nFalse impressions created by social polls can reduce the quality of political information on social media and further erode trust in these platforms.\n\nHow do these polls affect social media users\u2019 perceptions of the election information reported by mainstream media?\n\nIn a second study we found that some poll questions allude to mistrust in mainstream media. For example, the poll authors might say, \u201cGiven that the traditional media polls are biased, let\u2019s measure the real public opinion with this.\u201d Poll questions hint about conspiracies with voter fraud, rigged elections, and follow that kind of narrative.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge the potential impact of these polls in general discussions among the public and in the media. We know that many conservative people in the U.S. have very low trust in mainstream media and information coming from them \u2014 but they trust the social polls they engage with.\n\nFor example, they might think \u201cI voted on an X poll last week, and in that poll, Trump is winning by 75%. But in the poll published in The New York Times, Trump\u2019s winning by only 55% \u2014 so mainstream media are biased.\u201d\n\nIf you consider all the things happening right now in the media, the government, politics, and social media, this can be impactful.\n\nWhat is the purpose of the Social Polls website your team created?\n\nThe Social Polls website is a platform to communicate our research findings to the public. We are examining polls conducted over social media to see how the results change daily. We also publish social media poll results after we adjust for bias using sample reweighting methods. And we are constantly updating as we approach the election.\n\nThere is a similar website called fivethirtyeight.com, which was founded by statistician Nate Silver.",

        "text": "Democrats warned to keep euphoria in check as election remains on knife-edge\nAnxious Democratic strategists are quietly trying to douse the euphoria engulfing Kamala Harris\u2019s presidential campaign by warning that her surge in popularity masks an election contest that is on a knife-edge and could easily be lost.\n\nAs the vice-president basks in adulation and optimism at the Democratic national convention in Chicago, key supporters are cautioning that more trying times lie ahead after an extended honeymoon period following her ascent to the top of the ticket in place of Joe Biden.\n\nFuelling the Democrats\u2019 feelgood mood have been a spate of opinion polls showing Harris with a national lead over Donald Trump while also leading or newly competitive in battleground states, including southern Sun belt states where Biden had been struggling badly before his withdrawal from the race last month.\n\nA recent compilation of national polls by 538, a polling website, showed Harris leading Trump by 46.6% to 43.8%.\n\nBut Chauncey McLean, the president of Super Forward, a pro-Harris Super Pac that has raised hundreds of millions of dollars for Harris\u2019s campaign, suggested that the poll figures concealed sobering realities.\n\n\u201cOur numbers are much less rosy than what you\u2019re seeing in public,\u201d he told an event hosted by the University of Chicago Institute of Politics on the convention\u2019s opening day on Monday.\n\nHe described Pennsylvania, which he identified as the most critical of seven battleground states, as a \u201ccoin flip\u201d between Harris and Trump.\n\nAnd despite the apparent resurrection in the Democrats\u2019 prospects, the race overall remains as close as ever.\n\n\u201cWe have it tight as a tick, and pretty much across the board,\u201d Reuters quoted McLean as saying. To win, he said, Harris must capture one of three states \u2013 Pennsylvania, North Carolina or Georgia. Recent surveys in the first two have recorded her with a narrow lead or neck-and-neck with Trump, while Trump leads by a wider margin in Georgia, a southern state that Biden won narrowly in 2020.\n\nMcLean said Harris\u2019s momentum stemmed from an early enthusiasm among young voters of colour in the Sun belt states of North Carolina, Georgia, Nevada and Arizona.\n\nBut she had yet to reassemble the coalition of Black, Hispanic and young voters that underpinned Biden\u2019s victory four years ago. Internal polling shows that voters want more detail on policy.\n\nThe cautionary theme was amplified by David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to Barack Obama, who told the Guardian this week that the Harris campaign must guard against complacency.\n\n\u201cI think that if the Harris campaign has one message it will try to get across during this convention, it\u2019s that there is no room for complacency in this election,\u201d he said.\n\nThe vice-president has already faced scrutiny over her recent disavowal of liberal policy positions she assumed during her ill-fated campaign for the Democratic nomination in 2020, when she publicly opposed fracking and advocated a single-payer health insurance system that would ultimately have ended private health insurance.\n\nWhile subtly trying to stake out differences from Biden\u2019s position on economic policy \u2013 a vulnerable area for Democrats \u2013 she has so far avoided one-on-one media interviews since being confirmed as the Democratic nominee, an approach that will need to be jettisoned as the campaign proceeds, thereby ushering in the dangers of public misstatements or policy pronouncements that prove unpopular.\n\nBut in comments to the New York Times, Chris Murphy, the Democratic senator from Connecticut, said embracing ideas of economic populism that are controversial because they run counter to the prevailing free-market neoliberal orthodoxy might be necessary to win precisely because they are attractive to Trump supporters.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cI think that our coalition is bound to lose if we don\u2019t find a way to reach out to some element of the folks who have been hoodwinked by Donald Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to win over 25% of his voters. We have to win 5 or 10% of his voters.\u201d\n\nFernand Amandi, a Democratic strategist who worked on Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 and 2012 presidential election campaigns told the Hill that Harris\u2019s campaign needs to weather a storm at some point.\n\n\u201cEvery presidential campaign in modern history has had to go through an unanticipated scandal, crisis or world event, and at some point, that political law is going to happen to Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil she passes that stress test \u2013 and I\u2019m confident she will \u2013 this election is still wide open. Anyone who is measuring the drapes at the White House needs a serious reality check.\u201d\n\nAnother strategist, Tim Hogan, told the same outlet: \u201cDemocrats are rightfully elated with the trajectory of the Harris-Walz campaign. But anyone politically conscious over the last decade \u2013 especially Democrats \u2013 knows that terrain can shift and events beyond our control can quickly change the nature of elections.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThis is going to be a nail-biter.\u201d\n\nJim Messina, Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign manager, told Fox News that the election outcome would be determined by undecided voters, which he estimated to be about 5% of the electorate. \u201cAnd the question is, are some of those voters going to get out and actually vote,\u201d he said.\n\nJames Carville, the architect of Bill Clinton\u2019s successful 1992 election campaign and a vocal advocate of Biden\u2019s withdrawal after his flunked debate performance in June, cautioned about the dangers of over-optimism immediately after Harris emerged as his successor nominee last month.\n\n\u201cI have to be the skunk at the garden party. This is too triumphalist,\u201d Carville told MSNBC five days after Biden stepped aside on 21 July.\n\n\u201cI think the vice-president, to put it in athletic terms, needs a really good cut man in the corner, because she\u2019s getting ready to get cut. All I\u2019m doing is saying, \u2018Watch out people, don\u2019t get too far out there.\u2019 If we don\u2019t win this, all this good feeling is going to evaporate and be all for naught, and that\u2019s what I kinda think my role is right now.\u201d",

According to latest reports, Kamala Harris is lagging behind in the key swing state of Pennsylvania, based on two recently released poll surveys. Meanwhile, another survey has stated that Donald Trump is ahead of the reigning VP at the national level.The US Presidential Elections 2024 intensity has increased to a maximum with the Democratic National Convention 2024 ongoing since Monday, August 19, which has already featured addresses from the likes of Hillary Clinton, the former candidate from the 2016 Presidential polls, along with reigning US President Joe Biden, who was until recently, the ticket holder for the Democrats in the US Polls 2024.The 2024 Presidential Elections poll surveys by conducted by Cygnal and Emerson College for the key swing state of Pennsylvania, saw Harris trailing by one point against Trump. This is a serious bad news for Harris as she needs to find her foothold in the swing states if she wants to stand a winning chance in the US Presidential polls 2024.If this was bad news, the worse was yet to come, as a Napolitan News Service survey across the country gave a one-point lead to the former US President. This actually puts Harris on the edge just ahead of DNC 2024, since this event will see her accepting the Democratic party ticket officially in a grand reception of sorts.However, it must also be noted that Harris is slowly finding a grip in the poll race in recent weeks after being suddenly bomb-dropped into the elections after Joe Biden's surprise exit from the ticket. There were some previous surveys that had placed Harris well ahead of Trump, and these current survey setbacks should not damage the Democrat morale as there is a lot of course-correction to be done along the way.Kamala Harris, who is the Democratic Party candidate in the upcoming Presidential Elections of 2024, is gaining foothold quite steadily and has been projected ahead in the poll race against Trump in a number of US regions.Yes, the Democratic National Convention, which will feature some of the top leadership of the Democratic Party addressing the nation, has already started off from August 19.",

        "text": "Amid rising insecurity in Venezuela, the US and its partners must prepare for a new wave of migration\nMany Venezuelans who held out hope for political change are preparing to leave their country following a fraudulent presidential election and ensuing government-led repression. The United States and its regional partners must prepare domestically and coordinate internationally to respond to the coming wave of migration.\n\nMore than 7.7 million Venezuelans\u2014about a quarter of the population\u2014have left the country since 2014, 6.5 million of whom are living in Latin America and the Caribbean. Colombia alone hosts more than 2.8 million displaced Venezuelans, which has strained its ability to provide basic services amid its own ongoing fight against criminal groups. Available polling suggests migration flows are likely to rise in the coming months as Nicol\u00e1s Maduro looks poised to maintain his stranglehold on power despite the cost. His regime has severed diplomatic relations with regional countries, arrested thousands of protesters, and blocked social media platforms in the country.\n\nEarlier this month, opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado said that if Maduro stays in power by force, the region will experience \u201ca wave of migration like never before: three, four, five million Venezuelans in a very short span of time.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Venezuelans who have already left home are unlikely to return without political change. In a survey before the July 28 election of Venezuelans residing in the United States, 65 percent stated that they would return if an opposition candidate won the election, while less than 15 percent said they would return if Maduro remained in power, even if the economy significantly improved.\n\nFor desperate migrants, detainment, trafficking, and death might be a possibility, but for those who stay, they are often a certainty.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have the regional resources to handle the migration from Venezuela,\u201d Ronal Rodr\u00edguez, a researcher at the Colombian Migration Observatory in Bogot\u00e1, told the Associated Press this month. Young Venezuelans who already migrated have begun bringing over older relatives to see if conditions improve before the January presidential inauguration, but Rodr\u00edguez warns this could become a permanent flow.\n\nAs of May 2024, Colombia housed more than 2.8 million Venezuelans; Peru, more than 1.5 million; Brazil, more than 568,000; and the United States, more than 545,000. Chile and Ecuador host more than 532,000 and 444,000, respectively.\n\nFrom January to June 2024, US Customs and Border Protection reported 114,695 encounters with Venezuelans. (This figure includes individuals who attempted multiple crossings, so one individual may be counted for multiple encounters.) In the same period last year, the United States reported 150,673 encounters. This does not include spikes later in the year: in September 2023 alone, the United States reported 72,325 encounters. The United States may see similar spikes in encounters in the next few months as more Venezuelans make their way north.\n\nWhile it\u2019s too early to tell how many will migrate, regional leaders should prepare for the worst. Backlash toward Venezuelans is rising in Chile, which has used armed forces and thermal cameras to limit illegal crossings, and in Peru and Ecuador, which have tightened visa restrictions and required arriving Venezuelans to present difficult-to-obtain passports.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s largest gang, Tren de Aragua, and other criminal organizations have taken advantage of migrant outflows to push into host countries, increasing violent crime. But trying to curb legal migration has only increased illegal migration. For desperate migrants, detainment, trafficking, and death might be a possibility, but for those who stay, they are often a certainty.\n\nSo, how should the United States and its regional partners prepare for this expected increase in migration from Venezuela?\n\nDevelop plans for transitioning from temporary to more permanent response strategies. Several major host countries, including the United States, Colombia, and Brazil, have developed distinct responses to the influx of migrants by granting various forms of temporary legal status to Venezuelans. Under Colombia\u2019s temporary status program, for example, qualifying Venezuelans can obtain a ten-year permit, which includes work authorization, labor protections, and access to public education. Widespread rollout has seen more than 1.9 million Venezuelans approved for permits. Last September, the United States expanded Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to half a million Venezuelans, allowing them to live and work in the country legally and adding to the estimated 240,000 previously covered.\n\nNeither program is perfect. Colombia\u2019s program has been critiqued as offering only \u201climinal legality\u201d because it does not offer a direct line to permanent residence. The United States\u2019 TPS program likewise does not involve a path to permanent residency, though some politicians have cautioned that expanding TPS will incentivize additional migrants to journey to the United States and will allow people to stay indefinitely if their status is extended. However, the TPS extension has been praised in other US political circles because it grants work access, increases self-sufficiency, and relieves strains on local resources.\n\nBrazil\u2019s two-year renewable permits for Venezuelans grant similar rights and access as Colombia and the United States. After two years, however, Venezuelans can apply for long-term residence and, potentially, citizenship. Brazil also implemented a mass asylum grant in 2019 which has been extended to more than a hundred thousand people. Unlike many countries, Brazil grants work authorization to asylum seekers, leading more Venezuelans to seek the asylum route there.\n\nWhile much attention has been directed toward temporary status programs, there is a clear discrepancy between the long-term nature of the Venezuelan crisis and the temporary nature of these programs. For migrants and refugees, temporary status often adds to their insecurity, rather than mitigating it. Most programs last only a few months or years and involve complicated renewal processes. Most also do not necessarily offer direct paths to permanent residency, making it harder for Venezuelans to invest in their futures.\n\nFor many countries with convoluted or heavily bureaucratic immigration systems, short-term programs, such as TPS, are useful for providing more responsive options for displaced persons. However, the majority of displaced Venezuelans have obtained legal status through more institutionalized programs, including mobility and residence agreements and asylum and visa programs. Improving the adaptability and applicability of existing immigration infrastructure involves clarifying qualifications and application steps, reducing processing time, and demystifying any renewal processes. Expanding and simplifying access to these programs can provide greater stability for Venezuelans, allowing them to integrate more rapidly and bolster the host country\u2019s workforce.\n\nInvest in improving working conditions in host countries. Most urgently, host countries should focus on improving conditions in sectors with high degrees of informality, temporality, and low pay. These sectors often have higher concentrations of Venezuelan migrant and refugee laborers.\n\nIn Colombia and Brazil, access to work permits has not necessarily led to formal employment, and Venezuelans often face poor working conditions and labor abuses. In Brazil, a 2017-2021 survey found that more than half of all displaced Venezuelans were earning less than the Brazilian minimum wage.\n\nHost countries can start to improve working conditions by fostering public-private partnerships between civil society actors, trade unions, migrant associations, and government actors. These partnerships can work to improve wages, educate migrants on their rights, and prevent and challenge labor abuses. Expanding the network of institutions that invest in these efforts to create a more robust support system can create benefits not only for displaced Venezuelans but also for the economies of host nations.\n\nStrengthen international coordination toward Venezuela aimed at mitigating its ongoing political and economic crisis. Without progress on a democratic transition in Venezuela, the United States and regional partners will need to take steps to either accommodate Venezuelans\u2019 displacement on a more permanent basis or provide support to governments that are willing to do so. Greater humanitarian assistance and public-private partnerships can alleviate the worst of the widespread poverty and suffering facing Venezuelans both at home and abroad.\n\nMitigating the refugee crisis will also improve the economic and security situation of Colombia and other host countries, returning benefits for Venezuela\u2019s neighbors. Regional leaders must continue to support negotiations and prioritize efforts to address Venezuela\u2019s political and economic crisis to mitigate the impact of the projected mass exodus in the coming months.\n\nLucie Kneip is a program assistant at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center, where she contributes to the center\u2019s work on Venezuela and Colombia.\n\nFurther reading\n\nImage: Venezuelan migrants who recently arrived to Mexico wait to be processed by Mexican migration authorities to complete legal residency procedures, in Ciudad Hidalgo, Chiapas state, Mexico, July 29, 2024.

Pew Research Center is a nonpartisan, nonadvocacy fact tank that informs the public about the issues, attitudes and trends shaping the world. Knight Foundation is a social investor committed to supporting informed and engaged communities. Learn more >\n\nTikTok has been so popular among young Americans that presidential campaigns are using it for voter outreach. And some young adults are using TikTok to keep up with politics or get news, a March Pew Research Center survey shows.\n\nHow we did this Pew Research Center conducted this analysis to understand age differences in TikTok users\u2019 views and experiences on the platform. The questions are drawn from a broader survey exploring the views and experiences of TikTok, X, Facebook and Instagram users. For this analysis, we surveyed 10,287 adult internet users in the United States from March 18 to 24, 2024. Everyone who took part in the survey is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way, nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey was weighted by combining the sample of internet users with data from ATP members who do not use the internet and weighting the combined dataset to be representative of all U.S. adults by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. This analysis is based on those who use TikTok. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology. Here are the questions used for this analysis, along with responses, and the survey methodology. This is a Pew Research Center analysis from the Pew-Knight Initiative, a research program funded jointly by The Pew Charitable Trusts and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. Find related reports online at https://www.pewresearch.org/pew-knight/.\n\nOur survey explored various reasons people might use TikTok and other social media platforms. Young TikTok users stand out from their older peers on several of these reasons, including:\n\nKeeping up with politics or political issues. For 48% of TikTok users ages 18 to 29, this is a major or minor reason why they\u2019re on the platform.\n\nBy comparison, 36% of those ages 30 to 49 and even smaller shares of older users say the same:\n\n22% of those 50 to 64\n\n24% of those 65 and older\n\nGetting news. We also asked TikTok users if getting news in general is a reason they use the platform \u2013 regardless of whether that\u2019s political news or another topic entirely. About half of those under 30 say getting news is a major or minor reason they use TikTok.\n\nThat compares with 41% of TikTok users ages 30 to 49 who say getting news is a reason they\u2019re on it. The shares of older users saying so are even smaller:\n\n29% of those 50 to 64\n\n23% of those 65 and older\n\nTikTok has increasingly become a destination for news, bucking trends on other social media sites. A 2023 Center study showed more Americans \u2013 and especially young Americans \u2013 regularly get news on the platform compared with a few years ago.\n\nFor more on what motivates TikTok use \u2013 like entertainment, which is a major draw for most TikTok users \u2013 read our deep dive into why and how people use the platform.\n\nWhat people see and share on TikTok\n\nSeeing political content\n\nNearly half of all TikTok users (45%) say they see at least some content about politics or political issues on the platform. That includes 6% of users who say political content is all or most of what they see.\n\nHalf of users under 30 say they see at least some political content on TikTok. That\u2019s higher than the 39% of those 50 and older who say the same. However, the shares of 18- to 29-year-old users and 30- to 49-year-old users who say this are statistically similar.\n\nSharing political content\n\nAs on other platforms we\u2019ve studied, far smaller shares post about politics than see political content on TikTok. About one-in-ten users ages 18 to 29 (7%), 30 to 49 (8%) and 50 to 64 (8%) post at least some political content there. That compares with just 2% of TikTok users 65 and older.\n\nBut many users \u2013 63% \u2013 post nothing at all.\n\nOnly 36% of TikTok users say they ever post or share on the platform. Users ages 30 to 49 are most likely to say this, at 44%. That compares with 37% of those 18 to 29, 26% of those 50 to 64 and 15% of those 65 and older.\n\nSeeing news-related content\n\nRegardless of whether TikTok users say getting news is a reason they\u2019re there, most see humor and opinions about news on the platform:\n\n84% say they ever see funny posts that reference current events on TikTok\n\n80% ever see people expressing opinions about current events\n\n57% ever see news articles posted, reposted, linked or screenshotted\n\n55% ever see information about a breaking news event as it\u2019s happening\n\nUsers under 50 are more likely than older users to say they ever see each of these.\n\nAnd TikTok users under 30 stand out further in seeing opinions about current events and information about breaking news. They are more likely than any other age group to ever see these two kinds of content.\n\nTikTok and democracy\n\nDebates around TikTok\u2019s impact on the political environment in the United States \u2013 including for young voters specifically \u2013 are squarely in the national spotlight. We wanted to understand: Do TikTok users think the platform impacts democracy, and how?\n\nOverall, TikTok users are roughly twice as likely to think it\u2019s mostly good for American democracy as they are to think it\u2019s mostly bad (33% vs. 17%). But the largest share of users (49%) think it has no impact on democracy.\n\nTikTok users under 30 are more positive, however \u2013 45% of this group say it\u2019s mostly good for democracy. That compares with:\n\n30% of users ages 30 to 49\n\n23% of users 50 to 64\n\n15% of users 65 and older\n\nEven among users under 30, 39% say the platform has no impact on democracy. That share increases to 66% among users 65 and older.\n\nThe March survey found only minor differences by political party among TikTok users in views of its impact on democracy. Still, as lawmakers attempt to ban TikTok over national security concerns, other Center research has found that views of banning the platform have been sharply divided by political party among the general public.\n\nTo learn more about how Americans view and experience TikTok, X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram, read these companion reports:\n\nThese Pew Research Center reports and this analysis are from the Pew-Knight Initiative, a research program funded jointly by The Pew Charitable Trusts and the John S. and James L.

        "text": "2024 Election Platforms: Key Policy Differences Explained\nFormer US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton addresses the crowd on the first day of the Democratic National Convention at the United Center in Chicago on Monday, Aug. 19, 2024. Credit: Heather Asiyanbi / via Racine County Eye / ALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nAs the 2024 presidential election approaches, the Republican and Democratic national committees have released their 2024 election platforms, showcasing starkly contrasting visions for the nation\u2019s future.\n\nThe two parties diverge sharply on critical issues, including immigration, the economy, and housing, each offering a distinct path forward.\n\nImmigration: Border Security vs. Comprehensive Reform\n\nThe Republican platform takes a hardline stance on immigration, framing it as a critical issue of national security.\n\nThe Republicans pledge to \u201cseal the border\u201d and \u201cstop the migrant invasion,\u201d emphasizing the completion of the border wall initiated under former President Donald Trump. The platform calls for the \u201clargest deportation operation in American history\u201d to remove millions of undocumented immigrants from the country.\n\nRepublicans argue that current immigration policies under President Joe Biden have led to a surge in illegal crossings, which they claim is driving up crime rates and burdening public services. The platform also promises to cut federal funding to sanctuary cities and to reinstate strict immigration enforcement policies, such as the \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d program and travel bans from certain countries.\n\n\u201cRepublicans will restore every Border Policy of the Trump administration and halt all releases of Illegal Aliens into the interior. We will complete the Border Wall, shift massive portions of Federal Law Enforcement to Immigration Enforcement, and use advanced technology to monitor and secure the Border,\u201d the 2024 Republican National Committee Platform reads.\n\nBiden did support a bipartisan immigration bill that Republicans blocked. The bill aimed to address border security by hiring more Border Patrol agents, increasing the number of immigration judges and asylum officers, and implementing new technology to combat drug trafficking. It also sought to expand lawful immigration pathways and expedite work authorization for eligible individuals. The bill faced opposition from Congressional Republicans, who ultimately blocked its passage.\n\nIn contrast, the Democratic platform advocates for comprehensive immigration reform that balances border security with humanitarian concerns.\n\n\u201cDemocrats will secure the Border and fix the broken immigration system by modernizing border security while ensuring fair and humane treatment of migrants and asylum seekers.\u201d\n\nThe Democrats call for expanding legal immigration and creating a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, particularly for those who were brought to the U.S. as children under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.\n\nDemocrats emphasize the need to address the root causes of migration by investing in development and security in Central America.\n\nThey also propose modernizing the asylum system and ensuring humane treatment of migrants at the border, focusing on family reunification and protecting the rights of asylum seekers.\n\n\u201cThe public wants border security and border control. They also want policies that protect undocumented immigrants and that give immigrants better legal pathways to come to the U.S.,\u201d said Andrea Flores, vice president of immigration policy and campaign at fwd.us, during a discussion about immigration policy at the DNC.

Credit: Mark Hertzberg / via Racine County Eye / ALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe Economy: Deregulation vs. Equitable Growth\n\nEconomic policy is another area where the parties present divergent approaches.\n\nThe Republican platform centers on reducing government intervention in the economy, strongly emphasizing deregulation and tax cuts. Republicans argue that unleashing American energy production \u2014 primarily through oil, natural gas, and coal\u2014will spur economic growth, reduce inflation, and position the U.S. as the world\u2019s dominant energy producer.\n\n\u201cWe will DRILL, BABY, DRILL, and we will become Energy Independent and even Dominant again. The United States has more liquid gold under our feet than any other Nation, and it\u2019s not even close. The Republican Party will harness that potential to power our future,\u201d the document reads.\n\nThe Republicans also pledge to turn the U.S. into a manufacturing superpower by cutting corporate taxes, reducing regulations, and renegotiating trade deals to prioritize American workers. The platform includes specific promises to eliminate taxes on tips for service industry workers and to make the Trump-era tax cuts permanent.\n\n\u201cThe Republican Party must return to its roots as the Party of Industry, Manufacturing, Infrastructure, and Workers. President Trump\u2019s economic policy to end Inflation and return Manufacturing Jobs is not only what the American Economy and American Workers need right now, it is also what they want right now,\u201d the RNC 2024 platform reads.\n\nOn the other hand, the Democratic platform focuses on economic equity and investing in the middle class. Democrats advocate for growing the economy \u201cfrom the bottom up and the middle out\u201d by raising the federal minimum wage, expanding worker protections, and ensuring that corporations and the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes.\n\n\u201cDemocrats have a different record. We\u2019re delivering on President Biden\u2019s pledge to rebuild our economy from the middle out and bottom-up, not the top down. We\u2019re investing in America \u2013 in our infrastructure, our industry, our people, and our future,\u201d according to the DNC 2024 platform document.\n\nThe Democratic platform also emphasizes rebuilding America\u2019s infrastructure and boosting domestic manufacturing through government investments in clean energy and technology. Democrats argue that these initiatives will create millions of good-paying jobs and reduce economic inequality while addressing the urgent challenge of climate change.\n\n\u201cDemocrats know the story of the middle class isn\u2019t separate from the state of the economy \u2013 it\u2019s at its heart. And we\u2019ll never quit fighting to make sure that everyone is in on the deal,\u201d the document reads.\n\nHousing: Affordability and Access\n\nHousing policy is another critical point of divergence.\n\nThe Republican platform addresses housing primarily through the lens of deregulation, arguing that reducing government regulations on housing development will lower costs and increase supply, making housing more affordable for Americans. They propose opening limited portions of federal land for home construction and promoting homeownership through tax incentives for first-time buyers.\n\n\u201cTo help new home buyers, Republicans will reduce mortgage rates by slashing Inflation, open limited portions of Federal Lands to allow for new home construction, promote homeownership through Tax Incentives and support for first-time buyers, and cut unnecessary Regulations that raise housing costs,\u201d according to the 2024 Republican National Committee platform.\n\nRepublicans also tie the issue of housing affordability to immigration, claiming that the influx of undocumented immigrants has driven up housing costs and strained public resources. The Republican platform advocates for strict immigration enforcement to stabilize housing markets, particularly in urban areas.\n\n\u201cRepublicans will prioritize Merit-based immigration, ensuring those admitted to our Country contribute positively to our Society and Economy, and never become a drain on Public Resources. We will end Chain Migration and put American workers first,\u201d the platform document reads.\n\nThe Democratic platform, however, prioritizes direct government intervention to address the housing crisis. Democrats call for increased federal investment in affordable housing, including constructing millions of new homes and expanding rental assistance programs. They also propose measures to combat homelessness, such as increasing funding for emergency shelters and supportive housing services.\n\n\u201cDemocrats will increase federal investment in affordable housing, including the construction of millions of new homes and the expansion of rental assistance programs. We will work to combat homelessness, focusing on increasing funding for emergency shelters and supportive housing services,\u201d according to the 2024 Democratic National Committee platform.\n\nDemocrats emphasize the need to address systemic inequalities in the housing market, including discrimination in lending and housing practices. They advocate for stronger protections against eviction and foreclosure, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which exacerbated housing instability for millions of Americans.\n\n\u201cWe will work to address systemic inequalities in the housing market, including discrimination in lending and housing practices, and advocate for stronger protections against eviction and foreclosure, particularly for those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d reads.\n\nA Nation At A Crossroads\n\nWith the election just months away, the 2024 platforms of the Republicans and the Democrats offer voters a clear choice between two fundamentally different visions for the future of the United States.\n\nThe platforms, which address issues ranging from immigration and the economy to housing and healthcare, reflect the deep ideological divide that has come to define American politics in recent years.\n\nAs the campaign unfolds, these contrasting visions will be at the forefront of the national debate, shaping the country\u2019s future direction for years to come.",

        "text": "How Russian gender-based disinformation could influence the 2024 U.S. presidential election\nMost people have a general understanding of disinformation \u2014 false information that is intentionally created to cause harm. Disinformation becomes \u201cgendered\u201d when deliberately false information draws on common understandings of issues like masculinity, femininity and sexual violence.\n\nAlthough gender-based disinformation does not receive as much attention as race-based disinformation, it\u2019s particularly dangerous because it taps into deep-seated beliefs about our own identities.\n\nNarratives about gender identity are also harder to fact-check than simple true or false stories.\n\nAs the Democratic Convention gets underway in Chicago, Vice President Kamala Harris is increasingly vulnerable to gender-based disinformation campaigns \u2014 if she isn\u2019t already a victim of them.\n\nRussian gender-based disinformation\n\nScholars have long understood that women politicians regularly experience misogynistic comments, but gender-based disinformation is insidious in other ways.\n\nStates like Russia target the citizens of western countries with gender-based disinformation to promote their foreign policy goals.\n\nWhen Canada assumed leadership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\u2019s (NATO) battle group in Latvia, Russia spread gender-based disinformation to Latvian Russian-speakers to undermine local support for Canada\u2019s mission. These campaigns claimed that the Canadian Armed Forces were filled with homosexuals and potential rapists. The core message was that Latvians should not trust Canadians.\n\nRecent studies have also found that Russia strategically uses bots and trolls to spread false stories about female politicians to influence public opinion before elections. If a male candidate aligns more closely with Russia\u2019s foreign policy goals, it may use gendered narratives to discredit that candidate\u2019s female opponent.\n\nThis type of gender-based disinformation often inflates the credibility of male candidates by portraying women as being unqualified, overly emotional, prone to lying and unintelligent.\n\nThese disinformation campaigns use cutting-edge technology to convey the right narratives to the right people. During its interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Russia used data crumbs commonly employed by internet marketers to \u201cmicro-target\u201d social media users with select disinformation based on their specific psychological and socioeconomic markers, as well as their political beliefs.\n\nThe 2024 election campaign\n\nAmericans should be aware of an onslaught of gender-based disinformation about Harris that will likely gain momentum after this week\u2019s Democratic National Convention.\n\nWhen Hillary Clinton ran for office in 2016, little was known about gender-based disinformation. Now that authorities know and understand the disinformation tactics used during that election, Americans can prepare for the ballot box with the lessons learned from history.\n\nThere are two disinformation tactics favoured by Russia and used in 2016 that it will likely use again in 2024.\n\nOne is to portray a candidate as inauthentic or hypocritical.\n\nClinton was the first female nominee of a major party and had the potential to mobilize female voters. To undermine domestic support for Clinton, Russia spread news stories that suggested that even though she was a woman, her policies belie the feminist cause, implying that real feminists should not support her.\n\nDuring the 2020 U.S. presidential election, Harris was similarly targeted with disinformation after Biden announced her as his running mate. There were claims that she did not deserve to be vice president because she was merely a diversity hire and had used sex to gain power. Those claims have been repeated since she became the party\u2019s presidential candidate.\n\nSegmentation is the second Russian tactic. It entails polarizing society and fragmenting groups at the same time. Research shows that one of the primary goals of state-sponsored disinformation campaigns is to break apart the social fabric of a country by amplifying social, cultural and political fault lines.\n\nAhead of the 2016 presidential election, one study found that Russian-backed accounts on Twitter (now X) spread narratives attacking feminists, claiming that they were \u201cman-hating\u201d ideologues who sought to suppress men\u2019s rights. Polarizing narratives like this were designed to create divisions between feminists and non-feminists.\n\nAt the same time, Russia sought to fragment the feminist movement. Accounts linked to Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency posed as feminists on Twitter to critique other feminists, claiming that feminism was too white to represent black feminists or too liberal to represent conservative feminists. Although these may be valid critiques of the feminist movement, Russia instrumentally used them to divide voters who might have come together to support Clinton.\n\nBaseless attacks on Harris\n\nAlthough links to states like Russia are unclear, the media environment is already filled with gender-based disinformation about Harris.\n\nA recent study found that among 130,000 public posts on X, Instagram and TikTok, 15 per cent of them erroneously claimed that Joe Biden called Harris a \u201cdiversity hire,\u201d seven per cent highlighted a video of a television judge slandering her, and three per cent made scurrilous and false allegations about her sexual history. X owner Elon Musk even circulated a deep fake video of Harris confirming that Biden selected her because she is a Black woman \u2014 the \u201cultimate diversity hire.\u201d\n\nGender-based disinformation is already part of the presidential election. Voters need to know that they are exposed to false information, and that it\u2019s not benign. It is often constructed by states like Russia to influence elections and undermine America\u2019s social cohesion.\n\nOwen Wong, Researcher at the Centre for International and Defence Policy, Queen's University, Ontario\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

President Saied has compromised the judiciary\u2019s independence and overhauled a number of key institutions following a 2021 power grab, including the electoral commission, the Independent High Authority for Elections (Instance Sup\u00e9rieure Ind\u00e9pendante pour les \u00c9lections, ISIE), which he restructured to place under the control of the president in 2022.\n\n\u201cAfter jailing dozens of prominent opponents and activists, Tunisian authorities have removed almost all serious contenders from the presidential race, reducing this vote to a mere formality,\u201d said Bassam Khawaja, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cThe government should immediately end its political interference in the electoral process, reverse repressive measures, and allow opposition candidates to take part in the ballot.\u201d\n\nOn August 10, the electoral commission announced it had preliminarily approved the three presidential candidates, including two former parliament members, Zouhair Maghzaoui and Ayachi Zammel. The head of the commission, whose seven members are nominated by the president, said it rejected 14 candidacies for lack of required endorsement signatures or financial guarantees, or for not meeting nationality criteria. Several candidates have filed appeals before the administrative court. By comparison, in the 2019 election, the electoral commission approved 26 candidates of various political affiliations.\n\nAt least eight prospective candidates have been convicted and sentenced to prison terms or lifetime bans on running for election since the start of the electoral period on July 14, with others experiencing harassment and intimidation.\n\nOn August 14, the Jendouba First Instance Court sentenced a rapper and businessman, Karim Gharbi, to four years in prison and imposed a lifetime ban on running for office, finding him guilty of charges of buying endorsement signatures. Gharbi had stated his intention to run for the presidency on July 26. Four people volunteering for Gharbi\u2019s campaign were sentenced to between two and four years in prison on August 2.\n\nOn August 5, a Tunis Court of First Instance sentenced five prospective presidential candidates to eight months in prison and a lifetime ban on running for office, on the charge of \u201cmaking donations to influence voters\u201d under article 161 of the electoral law, Mokhtar Jemai, one of the lawyers, told Human Rights Watch. They are Abdellatif Mekki, a politician; Nizar Chaari, a TV host; Mourad Messaoudi, a former judge; Mohamed Adel Dou, a retired military colonel; and Leila Hammami, an academic.\n\nThe candidates have appealed the decision, but Chaari and Messaoudi had announced their withdrawal as presidential candidates the day after their conviction. Three others were sentenced to eight months in prison on the same charge, including a member of Mekki\u2019s campaign and Chaari\u2019s campaign director, and another individual was sentenced to four years in prison.\n\nThat same day, a Tunis Court of First Instance also sentenced Abir Moussi, president of the Free Destourian Party (Parti Destourien Libre, PDL) and prominent opponent of Saied, to two years in prison, one of her lawyers, Nafaa Laribi, told Human Rights Watch. She was convicted of \u201cspreading fake news and rumors\u201d about the electoral commission, under article 24 of the repressive Decree-Law 54 on cybercrime, following a complaint from the electoral commission.\n\nMoussi, who has been arbitrarily detained since October 2023, submitted her candidacy to the electoral commission just two days before the court convicted her. She faces several other prosecutions, including three based on complaints from the commission in connection with political statements or activities.\n\nOn July 18, a Tunis court sentenced Lotfi Mraihi, leader of the Republican People\u2019s Union and prospective presidential candidate, to eight months in prison and imposed a fine of 2000 Tunisian dinars (approximately US$650), as well as a lifetime ban on running for office for allegedly \u201cmaking donations in cash or in kind in order to influence voters.\u201d His party\u2019s executive director and three other members were also convicted and sentenced.\n\nMraihi was previously arrested on July 3 allegedly on suspicion of money laundering, according to a Tunis court spokesperson. In January, a Tunis court had imposed a six-month suspended prison term under Decree-Law 54 for a comment he made on the radio that was deemed to criticize the president.\n\nOther potential candidates remain in arbitrary detention such as Ghazi Chaouachi, former leader of the Attayar (Democratic Current) party, who announced his intention to run for election on July 15, and Issam Chebbi, leader of Al Jomhouri (The Republican Party), whose party eventually withdrew. Both have been detained since February 2023 and are awaiting trial on politically motivated charges of conspiracy against state security and terrorism. Over a dozen of members of Ennahda (The Renaissance Party), the former ruling party, including its president and two party vice presidents, are also arbitrarily detained.\n\nTen potential candidates on July 31 denounced \u201csecurity harassment\u201d and restrictions targeting members of their campaigns, including arrests and security force confiscation of endorsements. At least eight prospective candidates said that the Interior Ministry had failed to provide their criminal records, which are required to run for election, although the electoral commission president said that no candidate was rejected for lack of this document.\n\nOn August 5, President Saied said: \u201cNo pressure has been exerted on anyone.... Those who speak of obstacles and difficulties ... seek to spread chaos, discord, rumors, and lies.\u201d\n\nUnder new regulations, presidential contenders are required to present a list of endorsement signatures from 10 members of parliament, 40 elected presidents of local governments, or 10,000 registered voters from at least 10 constituencies, with at least 500 voter signatures per constituency. The 2022 constitution also tightened nationality criteria, allowing only a Tunisian national, with Tunisian parents and paternal and maternal grandparents and no dual citizenship, to run for office.\n\nTunisia is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and as such is required to ensure that every citizen, without discrimination on the basis of political opinion, has the opportunity to take part and vote in genuinely free elections. The United Nations Human Rights Committee has found that \u201cfreedom of expression, assembly and association are essential conditions for the effective exercise of the right to vote and must be fully protected.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy blocking prospective challengers, President Saied is burying what remains of Tunisia\u2019s democracy with this election,\u201d Khawaja said. \u201cThe international community should no longer remain silent and should urge the government to rectify an already tainted electoral process.\u201d",

        "text": "AARP Election Polls Examine Races Across the U.S.\nAs candidates take their messages to voters, AARP has commissioned a series of exclusive polls focusing on presidential swing states and states with tight races to gauge voters\u2019 preferences and the issues that influence them.\n\nThese polls target voters of all ages and break out data on voters 50-plus. That group of older adults is likely to have an outsize influence on the outcome of the 2024 election because of its large numbers and dedication to turning out to vote.\n\nMembers only\n\n\u201cVoters over the age of 50 have historically been the deciders of the winners in the last several elections; in 2020 and 2022, they made up 55 percent and 65 percent of the electorate, respectively,\u201d says Khelan Bhatia, AARP\u2019s director of voter engagement. \u201cOur 2024 battleground state polls show that they\u2019re more motivated to vote than younger voters, which means they\u2019re likely going to be the deciders again in this year\u2019s election.\u201d\n\nThe AARP polls take a close look at matchups between the Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, and the Republican, former President Donald Trump. To date, the two candidates are often nearly tied in head-to-head matchups in many states. Voters also are asked about their preferences among Harris, Trump and third-party presidential candidates, and voters weigh in on some congressional and U.S. Senate races.\n\nIssues that matter in elections\n\nThe surveys, done by the bipartisan polling team of Fabrizio Ward and Impact Research, ask voters about their top issues. To date, immigration and border security; inflation and rising prices; the economy and jobs; threats to democracy; and reproductive issues have risen to the top in many states. Pollsters also queried voters on how important Social Security, Medicare, family caregiving, and the cost of prescription drugs, housing and utilities are in deciding their vote.\n\nHow to vote in your state Learn more about absentee and early voting, ID requirements and registration in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nVoters weigh in on the stances that would make them more likely to cast a ballot for a particular candidate: making sure workers get the Social Security they paid into the program, for example, or advocating for tax credits for unpaid family caregivers to help cover costs.\n\nCaregiving is also a focus of the AARP surveys, which ask voters how many hours per week they care for an older or ill adult or someone with a disability. Many voters reported spending a significant amount of time in a caregiving roll.\n\n\u201cIf candidates hope to win, they have to pay attention to [the concerns of older adults] like keeping Social Security strong and helping family caregivers take care of their loved ones,\u201d Bhatia says.\n\nData collected by the pollsters provides insight into the mechanics of how voters plan to cast their ballots this election season, whether that\u2019s early and in person before Election Day, by absentee or mail-in ballot, or by heading to the polls on Nov. 5.\n\nVoters also weigh in on how motivated they are to vote, whether they have favorable or unfavorable opinions of the candidates, and if they think the country is headed in the right or the wrong direction. Voters are also asked specific questions related to issues in their states.\n\nCheck our list of polls to find how voters across the country are leaning in the general election.",

But the couple also warned their party not to lose sight of what remains an extremely tight race amid the enthusiasm for Ms Harris's campaign. They stressed the election would be decided in a handful of key swing states.\n\n\"Make no mistake, it will be a fight,\u201d said the 63-year-old former president Mr Obama. Michelle Obama, 60, stressed the point further. \"We need to vote in numbers that erase any doubt,\" she said. \"We need to overwhelm any effort to suppress us.\" Mr Obama emphasised America's preparedness for a \"new chapter\", adding: \"We are ready for a President Kamala Harris. And Kamala Harris is ready for the job.\" The Obamas' appeal to Democrats to turn out in November exposed a deeper party anxiety about the narrow race between Ms Harris and Trump, who retains a tight hold on his loyal base of supporters across the country. Ms Harris has a slender lead in national polling averages but pollsters caution that the race remains a virtual tie in the handful of battleground states that will ultimately decide who wins under America's electoral college system. Though Ms Harris is technically the incumbent candidate, she has described herself and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, as the underdogs in the race. A simple guide to the US presidential election\n\nThe swing states set to decide the presidency in 2024 The Obamas also acknowledged the renewed sense of excitement within the party since Ms Harris replaced President Joe Biden following his exit from the race - making a tacit reference to the enthusiasm and message of hope that powered Mr Obama to victory in his 2008 presidential run against Republican John McCain. Mr Obama also went on to serve a second term, before Trump won the White House in 2016.\n\nDNC: Obamas captivate Democrat convention and endorse Kamala Harris\n\nMrs Obama, whose most memorable line from her last convention speech in 2016 was, \"when they go low, we go high\", did little to lower the temperature of the heated political rhetoric that has divided the country over the last decade. She attacked Trump for assailing her family and continuing to push \"ugly, misogynistic, racist lies as a substitute for real ideas and solutions that will actually make people's lives better\". In a broadside that generated some of the loudest cheers of the night, she mocked Trump for his use of the term \"black jobs\" on the campaign trail. \"Who\u2019s going to tell him that the job he\u2019s currently seeking might just be one of those black jobs?\" she said, referring to her husband's presidency. Mrs Obama also used her platform to remember her late mother, Chicago-raised Marian Robinson, who died earlier this year aged 86. \"I wasn't even sure if I could be steady enough to stand before you tonight, but my heart compelled me to,\" she told the audience.\n\n'This will still be a tight race' - Barack Obama\n\nVance and Harris host competing events\n\nTrump and running mate JD Vance have been holding rallies and events in swing states while the Democrats gather in Chicago. On Tuesday afternoon, Mr Vance used a news conference in neighbouring Wisconsin to attack Ms Harris over the \"failures\" of her vice-presidency. He zeroed in on crime and public safety, and the economy - two areas where the Republicans see a vulnerability. Referring to protests in the city of Kenosha after the police shooting of black man Jacob Blake in 2020, he said: \"Wisconsin has suffered when you don't have good, smart, pro-public safety and leadership, and that\u2019s what Donald Trump and I want to bring back to the White House.\u201d\n\nReuters\n\nHaving travelled to Wisconsin, Ms Harris was not present at day two of the convention in Chicago. But the event did feature a jubilant and star-studded roll call, with delegates from each state - as well as US territories - symbolically casting a vote for Ms Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz in the arena. Though the vice-president formally clinched her party\u2019s nomination earlier this month, the symbolic gesture quickly turned into a dance party. Lil Jon performed Turn Down For What before Georgia\u2019s announced its vote. Actor Sean Astin spoke during Indiana\u2019s turn, a nod to his role in the cult classic American football film Rudy, which is set in the state. An on-stage DJ spun songs for each state as delegates, on their feet and wearing bracelets that flashed red and white, delivered short speeches about why they were supporting Ms Harris and Mr Walz. BBC Verify: Six Kamala Harris claims fact-checked The vice-president then virtually addressed the crowd from her rally in Milwaukee - 90 miles away - at the same venue where Trump accepted his party's nomination four weeks ago. \"We are so honoured to be your nominees,\" she said of herself and Mr Walz. \"I'll see you in two days, Chicago.\"\n\nDoug Emhoff takes the stage\n\n'Hey, it's Doug!' - Kamala Harris's husband on how they met\n\nBefore the Obamas gave their speeches, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, Ms Harris's husband, made his own appearance to share personal stories about the vice-president - including how they were set up on a blind date by one of his clients in 2013. He spoke about their \"big, beautiful, blended family\", referring to his son, Cole, and daughter, Ella, from his first marriage. He described Ms Harris as a \"joyful warrior\" and a supportive parent who put their family first despite the demands of her job. Doug Emhoff could become the first US First Gentleman Ms Harris, who was flying back from her rally during her husband's speech, kept Air Force Two in the air so she could watch his speech live, the White House said. Mr Emhoff said the two would celebrate their 10th anniversary on Thursday night, when Ms Harris formally accepts the party's nomination in a primetime speech. \"Kamala was exactly the right person for me at an important moment in my life,\" he said. \"And at this moment in our nation's history, she is exactly the right president.\"",

        "text": "Guide to the 2024 Presidential Candidates\u2019 Policy Proposals \u2014 Penn Wharton Budget Model\nHarris Campaign Policy Proposals: PWBM estimates that the Harris Campaign tax and spending proposals would increase primary deficits by $1.2 trillion over the next 10 years on a conventional basis and by $2.0 trillion on a dynamic basis that includes a reduction in economic activity. Lower and middle-income households generally benefit from increased transfers and credits on a conventional basis, while higher-income households are worse off.\n\nPotential Harris Campaign Proposals for the Top Rate on Capital Gains: In recent campaign speeches, Vice President Kamala Harris has spoken about raising the top marginal rate on long-term capital gains. Official campaign sources have yet to release sufficient details about the proposal to model it fairly and effectively. However, reporting on the proposal suggests that the yet-to-be-detailed plan would add a new top rate for long-term capital gains, taxing them at 28% for filers with more than $1 million of income. Reporting also indicates that the Harris campaign is in favor of raising the net investment income tax (NIIT) from 3.8% to 5% for filers with more than $1 million of income, this has also not yet been independently confirmed by official campaign sources. Together, these proposals would amount to an all-in marginal tax rate of 33% on long-term capital gains for high income filers. Notably, this is below the all-in 44.6% top marginal rate for capital income in President Biden\u2019s proposed 2025 budget.\n\nTable 1 shows conventional revenue estimates for these two new proposals. They are estimate as stacked after other policies that we already analyzed in our Harris Campaign analysis released on August 26, 2024. PWBM estimates that together these two new proposals alone would raise $143.6 billion over the 10-year budget window, which offsets some of the Harris campaign revenue losses that we previously estimated in our August 26 release. Relative to the Biden FY 2025 Budget, however, these two proposals would lose $308 billion over the 10-year window.\n\nFor more information:\n\nPotential Harris Campaign Proposals for the Top Rate on Capital Gains",

        "text": "CBS News 2024 presidential election analysis: How many voters are persuadable?\nWith a close contest between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, including very tight battleground races, just how much room is there for movement before the election? Campaign ads and voter contact efforts aim to reach voters who might be persuaded to change their minds in the coming weeks. So, just how many persuadable voters are out there?\n\nWhile the precise number depends on the exact definition of \"persuadable,\" it's a small sliver of the electorate any way you look at it. That's because partisan loyalty has been high in recent years. Routinely, over 90% of Democrats and Republicans vote for their party's nominee. And few voters change which party they support from election to election. For example, according to exit polling, only 4% of Hillary Clinton's 2016 voters switched to Trump in 2020, and the percentage of Trump 2016 voters crossing over to Joe Biden in 2020 was also in the single digits.\n\nRelatedly, we don't find many voters who say they're unsure of their vote choice, even several months before Election Day. Nor are there many backing candidates who say they would even consider someone else.\n\nThat said, even a tiny group can be decisive. The last two presidential elections were decided by fewer than five percentage points nationally, and more importantly, by mere fractions of a point in the pivotal states. That makes the small group of potentially persuadable voters worth analyzing. Let's put some more precise numbers on this group.\n\nUnder narrow definition, who might flip between Harris and Trump?\n\nOne sensible definition of a \"persuadable\" voter is someone who's open to switching their vote. Nationally, 7% of Harris voters say they at least might consider Trump. And 8% of Trump voters say so of Harris. (Most say \"Maybe, there's still time,\" as opposed to an outright \"Yes, I would.\")\n\nPutting these groups together, just 7% of all likely voters are persuadable \u2014 or \"flippable\" \u2014 under this definition. That doesn't mean they will flip, but they at least signal an openness to it.\n\nWhile we don't know who will flip when they cast an ballot, we can use survey data to get a sense of who's been oscillating between candidates this summer. We have surveyed about a thousand voters at least twice since Mr. Biden dropped out, typically more than 10 days apart. Only 2% of them switched from Harris to Trump or vice versa between interviews.\n\nA broader definition: Who's unsure or only leaning toward a candidate?\n\nA somewhat broader definition would also include voters who are not sure of their vote initially or only are leaning toward Harris or Trump. That's because even if they haven't flipped so far, they are less firm than voters who pick one of these candidates outright. (Voters who said they were initially unsure or voting third party were then asked whether they lean toward Harris or Trump.)\n\nUnder this definition, 12% are persuadable \u2014 that's about 1 in 8 likely voters nationwide. This measure is down slightly from July, when Biden was still in the race. And it's a bit lower than the number in competitive states when Mr. Biden and Trump ran four years ago. The 1-in-8 figure also applies in the battlegrounds \u2014 the most competitive states that will see the most campaign activity trying to convince voters this fall.\n\nWhat do persuadable voters look like?\n\nPersuadable voters, by either definition, are younger and more racially diverse. They tend to identify as politically independent, and they're somewhat likelier than other voters to use social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok for news.\n\nAnd importantly, pocketbook concerns may be more salient for them. They are more likely than firmly decided voters to say their vote will mostly be about their personal financial situation, as opposed to their rights and freedoms.\n\nThey also aren't as likely to have turned out in recent elections or say they will be voting this year. That means part of the challenge for campaigns is getting these voters to turn out, which often goes hand in hand with persuasion.\n\nAt the moment, they are roughly even on leaned vote, but Harris may have more room to grow: 7 in 10 say they might consider her if they aren't already, while only half say so of Trump. And while the vast majority say they know what Trump stands for, only half say so about Harris.\n\nHarris' advantage with this group also represents an improvement from July. Just before Mr. Biden dropped out, most persuadable voters said they would not consider him if they weren't already.\n\nIn fact, some Democratic leaning voters who were undecided last month when Mr. Biden was the presumptive nominee have already shifted to Harris. She is enjoying a higher \"floor\" of support than Mr. Biden did, with more Democratic voters now locked into their decision. Part of the reason there's been a decrease in the number of persuadable voters since a month ago is that Biden 2020 voters, including many independents, are more firmly behind Harris than they were Mr. Biden.\n\nThis analysis is primarily based on a CBS News/YouGov survey of 3,258 registered voters nationwide fielded August 14-16, 2024. The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, and education based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and the U.S. Census Current Population Survey, as well as past vote. The margin of error for registered voters is \u00b12.1 points. Battleground states are Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.\n\nToplines:",

        "text": "Record-breaking 2024 US political ad spend likely to disrupt commercial media landscape\nUnprecedented levels of political ad spend, paired with evolving campaign media strategies, are creating new challenges for brand advertisers this year.\n\nThe media ecosystem is being flooded with political spend ahead of the highly contentious 2024 US presidential race / Adam Nir\n\nAs the 2024 US presidential election ramps up, investment in political advertising is reaching new heights. By some estimates, the figure could climb as high as $12bn before election day on November 5, up nearly 30% from the last presidential election in 2020.\n\nDemocrats have led in spending so far, and investments are likely to ramp up in the coming weeks.\n\nAnd while some traditional approaches to political advertising \u2013 like a focus on big, national TV spots \u2013 remain top-of-mind, media mixes for both Republicans and Democrats are changing shape to accommodate other channels.\n\nWith the election just 13 weeks away, the influx of spend is causing significant ripple effects across the broader media landscape, as commercial advertisers attempt to maneuver touchy content and inflated inventory prices.\n\nDigital rears its head, but linear remains king\n\nSo which channels are winning?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, who became the Democrats\u2019 frontrunner when President Biden decided to withdraw his candidacy on July 21, has moved at lightspeed to build campaign momentum on social media, using both paid and organic earned media tactics.\n\nShe shared her first campaign ad on X, formerly Twitter, just four days later, and actively embraced memes from \u2018brat summer\u2019 to \u2018coconut tree.\u2019 Harris has also leaned into TikTok, amassing 4.6 million followers in less than a month. It\u2019s an effort that has stoked support among young voters.\n\nThe Vice President\u2019s focus on digital channels reflects broader trends in political advertising. During this election cycle, digital is expected to attract $3.46bn in spend, or about 28% of total spend in the cycle. This represents a 156% uptick from 2020 levels.\n\nWant to go deeper? Ask The Drum\n\nDigital channels are attractive for a number of reasons \u2013 among the most compelling is their advanced audience targeting capabilities. In digital media planning and buying \u2013 especially transactions within walled gardens like Meta and Google \u2013 political campaigns have access to tools that enable them to serve personalized, highly relevant ads to specific voter groups.\n\nDespite this fact, digital still isn\u2019t the top dog. Linear TV will maintain the media landscape\u2019s stronghold on political ad dollars during this election cycle, attracting approximately 70% of total spend.\n\nLinear TV remains a cornerstone of Donald Trump\u2019s advertising strategy. The Republican nominee and former President ran his first major attack ad on Harris just days after she entered the race in late July. The 30-second spot, which took aim at Harris' immigration policy, aired on TV in six battleground states \u2013 Arizona, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin and Nevada. Trump\u2019s team dedicated a total of $12.3m to the effort, according to data from AdImpact published by The New York Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne reason for linear\u2019s ongoing dominance is the fact that the US electorate skews older, and older voters tend to consume broadcast and cable television at a higher rate than younger voters, so campaigns are simply meeting voters where they are.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t the only reason that political ad dollars keep funneling into linear. Linear is likely benefiting from the limitations of digital channels. Although digital channels, including social media and streaming, are growing in importance, they lack standardized reporting and transparency. Linear TV, however, maintains stringent disclosure requirements, which enables viewers \u2013 and political opponents \u2013 to easily access information on how much money was spent on a given ad and who funded it.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re sitting at home and you're watching Jeopardy on TV, and you see political ad, anyone with access to the internet can go online and figure out exactly how much money was spent on that ad, who is sponsoring that ad, who the executive officers of the campaign or issue group [are], and there is a very clear trail for disclosure. In digital, there is no such thing,\u201d says Tyler Goldberg, director of political strategy at Assembly Global, a Stagwell-owned agency involved in political media buying.\n\nBecause digital platforms don\u2019t provide the same level of insight, it\u2019s difficult for political campaigns to gauge and respond to their rivals\u2019 spending. As a result, linear TV remains the preferred choice.\n\nDespite the limitations, digital investment is still growing. Connected TV (CTV) and streaming, in particular, are attracting increasing political ad spend.\n\nAs traditional TV viewership declines, with Democrats, Republicans and Independents alike all consuming less linear TV compared to a few years ago, political advertisers see an opportunity to embrace streaming and CTV.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdImpact predicts that spending on CTV ads during the 2024 election will rise 24% from the midterm levels in 2022, totaling close to $1.34bn. This figure surpasses projected investment in Google and Facebook ads, which AdImpact predicts will be around $1.2bn.\n\nAnd not only are voters across party lines increasingly shifting to streaming and CTV, but a proliferation in platforms has made political advertisers spoiled for choice. Where they may have only considered Amazon Prime Video and YouTube a few years ago, they can now pick from inventory across Hulu, Netflix, Max, Disney+, Peacock, Paramount+ and more.\n\n\u201cAs a result, CPMs [cost per thousand impressions] are more affordable,\u201d says Jeremy Goldman, senior director of marketing, commerce and tech briefings at market research firm Emarketer.\n\nPlus, targeting on many streaming and CTV platforms have become more sophisticated \u2013 another big selling point for political campaigns looking to reach their base as well as undecided voters. \u201cYou can have greater confidence that you\u2019re reaching the right people and you have the right frequency caps in place,\u201d says Goldman. \u201cAnd then on top of that, it\u2019s cheaper to do so, so it\u2019s just become a better deal in relation to [other channels].\u201d\n\nThe more sophisticated targeting capabilities afforded by online video have already proved effective for some political candidates.\n\nFor example, in his 2022 gubernatorial reelection bid, Ron DeSantis allocated $20m of his $70m budget to streaming and online video platforms. His media team, led by FlexPoint Media, reportedly targeted specific voter demographics like veterans and South Florida residents on CTV. The strategy paid off handsomely; DeSantis flipped historically Democratic counties like Miami-Dade and Palm Beach, and ultimately secured the largest margin of victory in a Florida gubernatorial election in 40 years.\n\nThe ripple effect in commercial advertising\n\nAnd as billions of campaign dollars flood into the media ecosystem, commercial brands are being forced to rethink their strategies as inventory becomes scarcer and more expensive.\n\nThe sheer volume of political ads may drive up the cost of media inventory across the board, making it harder for non-political advertisers to secure premium placements without paying a premium.\n\n\u201cThe implications on national and state levels are similar \u2013 inventory will be snatched up by political candidates, and that will change supply and demand,\u201d says Jennifer Kohl, chief media officer at WPP-owned agency VML. The agency, Kohl says, expects to see political spend increase in the coming weeks, which \u201cwill take inventory away from brands and [may] increase pricing.\u201d\n\nSuggested newsletters for you Daily Briefing Catch up on the most important stories of the day, curated by our editorial team.

The Drum Insider Learn how to pitch to our editors and get published on The Drum.\n\nCompounding the issue is the fact that election day falls at a time when brands are often kicking off holiday campaigns, Kohl notes, increasing the pressure on brands looking to make the most of their media budgets and drive sales in the fourth quarter.\n\nOf course, the problem will vary in intensity across markets. Key battleground states, like Pennsylvania, Arizona and Georgia, for instance, are likely to see much higher levels of spend associated with candidates at both the state and federal levels.\n\n\u201cYou may be absolutely inundated with political ads in Columbus, Georgia, [the market of] which spills over into Alabama. But if you\u2019re in Birmingham, which is just 100 miles down the road, you\u2019re not going to see anything,\u201d says Goldberg.\n\nBecause of this kind of variance in different markets, Goldberg\u2019s team at Assembly Global has built out a model that can predict the intensity of political advertising in a given market. It\u2019s a tool that the agency uses to help advise brand clients on how to allocate media budgets during a high-intensity election cycle.\n\nHowever, changes to inventory supply and pricing aren\u2019t the only ways in which an influx of political ad dollars is likely to impact brand advertising.\n\nWhen consumers are surrounded by political messaging, their consumption habits can be influenced in surprising ways, Goldberg says.\n\nFor example, he says: \u201cIf you\u2019re \u2026 predisposed to being a Republican \u2013 maybe you\u2019re older, maybe you live in a certain market, in a certain state \u2013 and all of the political ads you\u2019re seeing are talking about inflation in the economy, does it make you less likely to go out and buy something expensive? Conversely, if you\u2019re getting targeted with a lot of Democratic messaging about \u2026 all of the support that the Biden-Harris administration put towards climate change policies, maybe you\u2019re more likely to go buy an electric vehicle the next time you\u2019re looking at a car.\u201d\n\nThe long and short of it is, \u201cthere are all of these secondary and tertiary effects of having people watching $12bn worth of political ads,\u201d Goldberg explains. \u201cSo if you\u2019re a commercial advertiser and you do not have a plan for analyzing how political [ad spend] is going to affect your Q3 and Q4, you\u2019re not operating with the most information. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to work alongside folks who understand the political landscape.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, the US can expect to see political ad spend continue on its upward trend into the coming years.\n\nPart of this projection stems from the set of circumstances that gave way to current spend patterns. Most notably, US campaign financing rules \u2013 and, by extension, political advertising norms \u2013 were shaken up drastically in 2010, when the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United ruling threw out campaign finance laws that limited corporate and union spending on political advertisements. It was a decision that opened the floodgates for corporations and unions to spend nearly unlimited amounts of money on political campaigns, elevating the influence of corporations and wealthy donors in US politics.\n\nAs a result, Goldberg says, \u201cthere's more money than ever in politics, and it is continuing to grow.\u201d\n\nFor now, as political ad dollars continue to flow, the advertising landscape will remain a battlefield \u2013 not just for political campaigns, but also for brands vying to maintain their visibility in a crowded market.\n\nFor more, sign up for The Drum\u2019s daily newsletter here.",

        "text": "US Presidential Election: What would a Harris-Walz foreign policy look like?\nThis week at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz will formally accept their party\u2019s nomination for president and vice-president. Given the speed and unusual circumstances in which Harris and Walz have emerged as their party\u2019s standard-bearers, observers around the world will be closely watching the convention \u2013 as well as the planned protests against United States\u2019 policy towards Gaza taking place on the sidelines \u2013 for clues as to the likely foreign policy approach of any future Harris administration.\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign has come together quickly, and so far, it has not focused strongly on world affairs. Harris has given no major speech on this topic, and none are currently planned. However, this should not be mistaken for disinterest, or inexperience \u2013 in fact, Harris would come to the Oval Office with more executive branch foreign policy experience than any president in decades.[1] By looking at her record both in the Biden administration and as a senator, it\u2019s possible to piece together her worldview and reach cautious conclusions about the direction she might take US foreign policy in an administration of her own.\n\nFor his part, Walz has less direct experience of foreign affairs \u2013 he has never served in the executive branch, and the only federal office he has held is as a member of the House of Representatives. That does not mean he\u2019s a blank slate though. Walz served 24 years in the National Guard, including deployments overseas, and also has a surprising, and long-running, interest in China. If he became vice president, he would bring a distinct populist worldview to the role.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick guide to what a Harris-Walz foreign policy might look like.\n\nGeneral principles and personnel\n\nPerhaps the biggest question about a Harris foreign policy is whether it would be mostly a continuation of the approach seen under current President Joe Biden or if it would chart some new course. The answer is probably the former. As vice president, it has been Harris\u2019 job to defend the policies of the administration she was a part of, meaning that any private doubts or disagreements she may have had were buried. Yet little about her record before becoming vice president suggests that Harris would make a fundamental break with this policy either.\n\nLike Biden, Harris has always been a committed internationalist who believes that the US should play an active role in world affairs. As vice president, she has chosen mainstream, career diplomats as her key foreign policy aides \u2013 first Nancy McEldowney, and then Philip Gordon. She has also enthusiastically embraced multilateral agreements such as the Paris Climate Accords and the Iran nuclear deal and made clear that she values and supports America\u2019s allies. All of this would suggest that, in contrast to Donald Trump, she believes in the need for America to lead groups of like-minded countries in tackling global problems.\n\nIf she has a major difference of principle with Biden, it\u2019s that she apparently views his tendency to frame global affairs as an ongoing battle between \u201cdemocracy\u201d and \u201cautocracy\u201d as a misleading over-simplification.[2] This echoes a criticism that has long been made by outside analysts who have pointed out that this narrative makes little sense in a world in which autocratic states like Saudi Arabia and Vietnam are close US partners.[3]\n\nAlthough Harris\u2019 criticism on this point seems to be mostly rhetorical, some foreign policy thinkers in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party are hoping it might be an opportunity for greater influence. Foreign policy progressives \u2013 who tend to believe in the need to reduce the U.S. military footprint around the world, dial back conflict with China, and be more consistent on democracy and human rights \u2013 would like to see some of their own kind placed in key positions in a future Harris administration.[4]\n\nGiven that she hails from a younger generation and has risen through the party at a time of greater progressive influence, Harris is likely more sympathetic to these voices than Biden has been. Yet there\u2019s little sign she has fully bought into their worldview, and the youthful, progressive wing lacks leaders with the experience and stature that Harris seems to value. In the end, she\u2019s likely to give second- and third-tier jobs to some while placing career technocrats in more important positions.\n\nPerhaps the greatest hope that progressives have for redirecting Harris\u2019 foreign policy comes from Walz, who over time has been more sceptical of military intervention than the average Democrat. He opposed the Iraq troop surge of 2006, Barack Obama\u2019s desire to strike Syria after the country used chemical weapons against civilians in 2013, and US support for Saudi Arabia\u2019s recent war in Yemen. Yet Walz\u2019s distaste for the horrors of war is more that of the soldier than the pacifist. In 2016, he joined Republicans in opposing cuts to the Army, arguing that it needed to be well-funded to face challenges around the world. As a Midwestern populist who served for 24 years in uniform, Walz has a deep appreciation of the costs of war for ordinary Americans \u2013 but he\u2019s no dove, either.[5]\n\nEurope and NATO\n\nIn the Biden administration, Harris has been a key spokesperson for the government\u2019s attempt to convene a coalition of countries to oppose Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. She has led the US delegation to the Munich Security Conference three times, met Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky six times, and called the US commitment to NATO \u201cunwavering\u201d and \u201csacrosanct\u201d.[6] On the other hand, however, she had little prior exposure to the continent before Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and has been criticized by some European officials for a lack of engagement on other issues.[7]\n\nAll of this suggests continuity. Harris is firmly committed to the defence of Ukraine, but otherwise seems to agree with the consensus position in US foreign policy circles that Europe is of declining importance in a world in which the locus of global power is moving towards Asia. At the same time, Gordon \u2013 Harris\u2019 key national security aide \u2013 is a dedicated Europhile who speaks four European languages and is well-known on the continent. If he takes a position in her administration, that ought to calm European leaders who are worried that Harris might leave them behind.[8]\n\nThe Middle East\n\nFew aspects of Harris\u2019 foreign policy views have generated as much comment as those on the Middle East. Whatever its merits, Biden\u2019s unequivocal support of Israel is out of step with his own party \u2013 and as a representative of a younger generation, Harris has been widely assumed to have more nuanced views.\n\nThe actual evidence for this is somewhat thin. Harris has publicly voiced more empathy for Palestinian suffering than Biden, and she is said to have privately advocated that the administration push Israel more forcefully towards either changing the way it conducts the war or ending it.[9] Since becoming the presumptive nominee however, she has neither announced any major policy departure nor wholeheartedly embraced left-wing protesters who oppose the administration\u2019s approach to the region. This has been noted, and protesters are planning to try to disrupt the DNC this week in an attempt to force policy changes.[10] They\u2019ll find little comfort from Harris\u2019 running mate, who has also hewed closely to the Biden administration\u2019s line throughout the conflict.[11]\n\nFor now, Harris seems to view the Middle East primarily through the lens of politics. She wants to win back left-wing voters critical of the administration without scaring away pro-Israel independent voters. In office, this splitting of the difference would be likely to continue \u2013 a consequence both of political necessity and Harris\u2019 pragmatic, non-ideological worldview.\n\nTrade and climate\n\nLike many Democrats, Harris has been on an interesting journey with regards to trade. She has described herself as \u201cnot a protectionist\u201d, but also said she would have voted against both the 1994 North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiated by Obama. This suggests that she does not buy into the old neoliberal consensus around free trade either. In fact, Harris in recent years has sounded more and more sceptical of free trade, and her running mate has always sounded that way. Walz opposed both NAFTA and the TPP as well as a host of smaller bilateral trade agreements during his time in Congress, some on the grounds that they would help to bolster governments with poor human rights records.[12]\n\nMost notably, both Harris and Walz opposed the Trump-negotiated United States, Mexico, and Canada Agreement \u2013 a replacement for NAFTA \u2013 because they said it did not do enough to protect the environment or workers\u2019 rights. This indicates that their administration would double down on the Biden administration\u2019s attempts to use trade as a tool of climate policy, and probably also to promote human rights. It also means that London\u2019s desire for a US trade deal will continue to be frustrated.[13]\n\nChina and the Indo-Pacific\n\nChina policy is another area in which Harris seems closely wedded to the Biden administration\u2019s position, which is that the US should attempt to pursue economic and military competition with Beijing while at the same time cooperating on shared challenges such as climate change. Harris has had relatively little exposure to China, having met its President Xi Jinping only once and never having travelled to the country.[14] Hence, there is little indication of how, if at all, she differs from the administration in which she has served. Especially given the strong hawkish consensus towards China which exists in US politics, she is unlikely to bring about any major change of policy.\n\nWalz, by contrast, has a long-standing interest in the country which has been reflected in both his private and public life. He first visited the country just after the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989 and has gone back over 30 times since, primarily to facilitate trips by American students. He has spoken admiringly of Chinese people but been sharply critical of their government\u2019s human rights abuses, including by meeting with the Dalai Lama. His nuanced view suggests that he understands the importance of dialogue between America and China, but is likely to push for strong criticism of its human rights record.[15]\n\nConclusion\n\nA Harris-Walz foreign policy is one which is not likely to see any major departure from Biden\u2019s approach. It will be strongly internationalist, remaining committed to the defence of Ukraine and organizing a coalition of countries to oppose the rise of China. It will likely be more engaged \u2013 and honest \u2013 about human rights and the environment, but still pragmatic and dominated by technocrats rather than progressive reformers. It will also, of course, be shaped by events which we cannot yet predict \u2013 much less understand the implications of \u2013 possibly even before US citizens go to the polls on 5th November.\n\nAndrew Gawthorpe is an expert on US foreign policy and politics at Leiden University and the creator of America Explained, a podcast and newsletter.

Now, Democratic strategist David Axelrod has finally spoken up about Trump's prospects in the US Presidential Elections 2024. According to Axelrod, Trump is a sure-shot winner in the US Polls 2024 , if the elections were held today itself.This was a clear message to those Democrats who are celebrating the surveys which place Kamala Harris slightly ahead of Trump, nationwide. According to Axelrod, even though Harris has improved the Democrats' image increasingly over the past few weeks, through her campaign, a lot of work still remains to be done, as the party is still reeling from Joe Biden's sudden exit from the Presidential poll race, as well as the dismal Presidential Debate, which was single-handedly dominated by Donald Trump.In terms of the game-changing abilities of Kamala Harris, she has been making great improvements and performing extraordinarily ever since she was handed over the baton the US polls 2024. However, her giant strides till now is still not enough to ensure a dominating victory over Donald Trump, who is much more agile and tough, than the last time he ran and lost against Joe Biden.Axelrod feels that things over the past few weeks have changed dramatically and ever since Harris was endorsed as the Democratic candidate for US President, things have taken a rather wild turn, with Hillary Clinton suddenly coming out of the shadows and fiercely backing the reigning VP, in the ongoing Democratic National Convention 2024 No, Hillary Clinton is not supporting the Republicans, and is instead a staunch supporter of VP Kamala Harris in the upcoming US polls 2024.The DNC 2024 is not a Republican event and therefore the presence of Donald Trump, a Republican candidate in the US polls, will not be observed there.",

        "text": "RFK Jr. is planning to drop out of the 2024 presidential race and endorse Trump\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. intends to end his independent presidential campaign and endorse former President Donald Trump, according to two sources familiar with the plans.\n\nThe sources cautioned that talks are ongoing but said there will be clarity by the end of the week. One of the sources said the campaigns are working toward a joint appearance.\n\nThe decision to drop out will end the most prominent third-party candidacy in the race. Kennedy announced Wednesday that he will give a campaign speech addressing \u201chis path forward,\u201d days after his running mate said the campaign faced a choice about staying in the election or dropping out to back Trump.\n\nKennedy\u2019s campaign announced he will hold the event in Phoenix on Friday. Trump, meanwhile, is also set to host an event on Friday night, in Glendale, a Phoenix suburb.\n\nNicole Shanahan, Kennedy's running mate, said Tuesday that the ticket is weighing two options. One is to stay in the race and \"risk\" a Harris-Walz presidency, as she put it in a podcast interview, while the other is to drop out of the race and \"join forces\" with Trump.\n\nPersuading Kennedy to back Trump has been an ongoing project of Trump's eldest son, Donald Jr., former Fox News host Tucker Carlson and wealthy donor Omeed Malik, according to a source familiar with the efforts who requested anonymity to divulge internal campaign deliberations. The three men have worked behind the scenes in meetings and calls with both principals to negotiate Kennedy\u2019s exit and endorsement, the source said.\n\nTrump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, said in an interview Wednesday that \"there's been a lot of communication back and forth\" between Kennedy and his campaign.\n\n\"I haven\u2019t spoken to RFK personally, but I know there\u2019s been a lot of communication back and forth between RFK, between the campaign, between this campaign,\" Vance said. \"Look, our argument to RFK, and I\u2019ll make it right now, because, of course, he hasn\u2019t dropped out yet, is, look: If you want a Democratic Party that protected American workers and stood for strong borders, maybe disagreed with Republicans on things like tax policy, that party doesn\u2019t exist anymore.\"\n\nVance also said Trump wouldn't promise a Cabinet position for Kennedy's endorsement.\n\nAnd Tuesday, Trump told CNN that he would be open to Kennedy's joining his administration if he is elected. Asked whether he'd consider putting Kennedy in the administration if he backed him and he won, Trump said, \u201cI probably would.\" He added, \"I like him a lot. I respect him a lot.\"\n\nMary Beth Cahill, a senior adviser to the Democratic National Committee, slammed Kennedy in a statement: \u201cDesperate men do desperate things. RFK Jr. was recruited by MAGA, funded by MAGA, and parroted MAGA talking points. No one should be shocked if he formalizes his relationship in an attempt to maintain relevance.\u201d\n\nTrump and Kennedy met in Milwaukee last month during the Republican convention, which came days after the assassination attempt against Trump.\n\n\"I know the president's been working hard for that, but it's completely separate from whether RFK gets a Cabinet position,\" Vance said. \"It's about welcoming a lot of those Democrats who feel abandoned by the party of Kamala Harris.\"\n\nKennedy's presence on the campaign trail has been minimal in recent weeks. He hasn't hosted a public, campaign-sponsored event since early July, and Shanahan hasn't been seen on the trail in months. Kennedy's standing in public polling has slipped, too.\n\nThe campaign has faced a string of damaging stories, from groping allegations against Kennedy from a former family babysitter to the bizarre story that Kennedy picked up a bear carcass on the side of the road years ago and used it to stage a bicycle accident in New York's Central Park.\n\nIn a podcast interview, Kennedy didn't specifically deny the groping allegation, which surfaced in a Vanity Fair article in July, saying: \"I am not a church boy. I am not running like that. I have said I had a very, very rambunctious youth. I said in my announcement speech that I have so many skeletons in my closet that if they could all vote, I could run for king of the world.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to comment on it,\" he added when asked again about the specific allegation.\n\nAnd he also faces financial troubles. The campaign closed July with almost $3.5 million in debt, according to the most recent campaign finance report. Those documents also show that Shanahan, who has been pouring her own millions into the campaign, received a refund of almost $1 million in July.\n\nKennedy's endeavor for ballot access in all 50 states has also hit a roadblock. He was recently disqualified from the ballot in New York state when a judge ruled that his home address used on signature petitions wasn't his place of residency.",

        "text": "US presidential election: With Harris, Democrats take back banner of freedom from Republicans\nAt the Democratic National Convention, United Center, Chicago, Illinois, August 20, 2024. KEVIN DIETSCH / AFP\n\nA presidential campaign in the United States always has a soundtrack. As soon as Joe Biden withdrew, Kamala Harris's choice was \"Freedom,\" by Beyonc\u00e9. This high-energy track is well suited to her political position. The vice president wants to reconcile Democrats with the notion of freedom, long confiscated by the conservative camp.\n\nRead more Subscribers only Kamala-mania brings enthusiasm back to Democratic camp\n\nHarris is working to broaden her electoral potential. Every party claims to be a \"big tent,\" in which many Americans, not necessarily affiliated, could find they belong. But only the Democratic Party seems to have this capacity. Conversely, the Grand Old Party (GOP), absorbed into the MAGA (\"Make America Great Again\") movement and lined up behind a candidate with a felony conviction, presents an apocalyptic vision of the country. It relies on inflation and migratory pressure as its only campaign arguments.\n\nFor the opening night of the Democratic convention in Chicago, Illinois, on Monday, August 19, Hillary Clinton spoke about the cracks in the glass ceiling \u2013 women's accession to the presidency \u2013 that she chipped away at during her own candidacy, in 2016. What does she see through those cracks? \"I see freedom. I see the freedom to make our own decisions about our health, our lives, our loves, our families. The freedom to work with dignity and prosper. To worship as we choose or not. To speak our minds freely and honestly. I see freedom from fear and intimidation, from violence and injustice, from chaos and corruption.\" Freedom: quite an agenda.\n\nFor Democrats, this cardinal value honors first and foremost individual rights, without discrimination based on ethnic background, sex or religion. Following in the tradition of the 1960s civil rights movement, it is directly associated with the notion of equality. It's a way of reconnecting with Abraham Lincoln, the Republican Party's tutelary figure, who opposed slavery. \"Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves,\" he wrote back in 1859.\n\nA political reversal\n\nDemocrats have a multifaceted approach to freedom. They want to encourage citizen participation in elections, while the right has sought to limit early voting options in many states. It's also about protecting vulnerable groups \u2013 notably the LGBTQ+ community. And there's a focus on defending the right to clean air and water as well as entering public places, especially schools, without fear in the face of the proliferation of weapons of war, which Republicans refuse to limit or ban.\n\nYou have 57.41% of this article left to read.

Kennedy Jr. is planning to drop out of the presidential race by the end of this week, sources familiar with the decision tell ABC News.\n\nSources tell ABC News that Kennedy plans to endorse Donald Trump -- but when asked directly by ABC News if he will be endorsing the former president, Kennedy said, \"I will not confirm or deny that.\"\n\n\"We are not talking about any of that,\" he said.\n\nSources cautioned the decision is not yet finalized and could still change, with one source adding that Kennedy's hope is, in part, to finalize things quickly in order to try to blunt momentum from the Democratic National Convention.\n\nOne possible scenario being discussed is for Kennedy to appear on stage with Trump at an event in Phoenix on Friday, though the sources cautioned that Kennedy's thinking could always change and sources close to Trump say no plan for Friday is finalized.\n\nKennedy's campaign manager, Amaryllis Fox, emailed senior staff on Wednesday morning thanking them for their hard work -- but indicated a decision on the way forward had not been made, a source familiar with the email told ABC News.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. speaks at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, July 26, 2024. Liam Kennedy/Bloomberg via Getty Images, FILE\n\n\"There are a couple potential paths forward, not only two, and I can bear witness to the care, examination that Bobby has invested in the consideration of each,\" Fox wrote, according to the source.\n\nA spokesperson for Kennedy posted on X that Kennedy will \"address the nation\" live on Friday to discuss his \"path forward,\" but offered no specifics.\n\nA spokesperson for the Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nKennedy's running mate Nicole Shanahan -- who in a podcast interview published Tuesday said Kennedy was considering a move to \"join forces\" with Trump -- told ABC News Wednesday that the choice is \"Bobby's decision\" and that he has her \"full support.\"\n\nOf the campaign's discussions with Trump's team, she said, \"All we can do is gauge sincerity, and we're gauging sincerity from Donald Trump.\"\n\nKennedy told ABC News regarding the Democratic convention and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, \"I think it was a coronation, it's not democracy. Nobody voted. Who chose Kamala? It wasn't voters.\"\n\nHe also complained about the way his campaign has been treated.\n\n\"She went in four weeks from being the worst liability for the Democratic Party to the second coming of Christ without giving one interview, without showing up for a debate, without a single policy that anyone thinks isn't ridiculous,\" he said. \"It's not democracy.\"\n\nFor weeks, Kennedy, buried under an avalanche of lawsuits brought by Democratic groups challenging his place on state ballots, has accused Democrats of acting undemocratically by trying to strip his supporters of the opportunity to vote for him.\n\nShanahan on Wednesday said, \"We're getting prosecuted politically right now. This is not normal for democracy.\"",

They\u2019ve called Harris\u2014who is simultaneously the nation\u2019s first Black, first Asian American and first female vice president\u2014a \u201cDEI hire.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump, for his part, has questioned Harris\u2019s racial identity. Attacks focusing on her race or sex are likely to continue as the election approaches. To learn more about what has, and hasn\u2019t, changed since Barack Obama was elected the country\u2019s first Black president in 2008, Inside Higher Ed spoke via phone earlier this month with Claude A. Clegg III, the Lyle V. Jones Distinguished Professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and author of The Black President: Hope and Fury in the Age of Obama (John Hopkins University Press). Clegg holds a joint appointment in the Chapel Hill history department and the African, African American and diaspora studies department. His answers have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nQ: You wrote a book on the Obama presidency. How did or didn\u2019t his victories and time in office lead to Trump\u2019s election, Biden\u2019s election and now Harris\u2019s nomination?\n\nA: Obama was possible because of a certain demographic change that\u2019s taken place\u2014is still taking place\u2014in which you have a larger number of people of color, minorities in this country.\n\nMost Popular Stories Most Popular\n\nThe Republican brand had been damaged pretty severely by George W. Bush in terms of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, an economy in free fall by 2008, so there was this confluence of things.\n\nObama mastered social media and also the internet \u2026 and he turned out to be a formidable candidate.\n\nTrump is a backlash.\n\nHis, of course, claim to fame, rise to prominence in the Republican Party has everything to do with his claim that President Obama was not only unfit for the office, but ineligible for the office, [that] he wasn\u2019t even born in this country \u2026 and also I think some real angst among a good portion of the American population in terms of being left out of the economy\u2014not seeing themselves, their values reflected in the political system.\n\nBiden, he\u2019s the sort of self-proclaimed antidote to Trump and Trumpism.\n\nQ: What do you find most striking about the current race, and what do you think pundits and journalists aren\u2019t paying enough attention to?\n\nA: You have a woman of color, a woman of South Asian and Black ancestry who has as strong a pedigree as a candidate for the presidency as anyone. She was elected to be the attorney general of the most populous state in the country, California, and then elected to be the U.S. senator from that same state; she has served as vice president.\n\nShe\u2019s about 20 years younger than Mr. Trump as well, so just the juxtaposition of those two candidates is very striking. And I think it says more than a thousand words about our particular moment that both of those two candidates are competitive for the job of president.\n\nUnder the whole DEI language is the notion that this is a white male job, and if you\u2019re not a white male, then you\u2019re not really qualified.\n\nOther things are getting underemphasized \u2026 the people who are eclipsing the baby boomers and the kinds of things that they would privilege in terms of their concerns. Things such as climate change, things such as affordability of education \u2026 also, Gaza.\n\nThis election is going to be decided by thousands of votes, not millions of votes, in a handful of swing states \u2026 the antiwar vote could cost you the election.\n\nI think that [Harris] is paying very close attention to the folks that were critical of the conduct of the war in Gaza, the college campus folks who had all of these protests.\n\nQ: How have racial politics changed since Obama\u2019s presidency, and how will that affect the race between Harris and Trump?\n\nA: The similarities are striking. You have two candidates who are former U.S. senators from blue states, mixed-race folks both of them, Harris and Obama, very unique narratives about the American dream and what\u2019s possible, rising to the highest ranks \u2026 but they are running in somewhat different times. Harris is running after Obama, so I think it\u2019s easier to conceive of her possibly as president than if there had never been an Obama.\n\nBecause there was a Hillary Clinton, I think we can imagine a woman as a major party candidate for the office. Although she did not win in 2016, she won the most votes.\n\n[Obama] faced the same sort of \u201cothering\u201d approach or playbook that Kamala Harris is facing now. [With] Obama there are those who made sure they mentioned his entire name when he was running in 2008\u2014Barack Hussein Obama\u2014and they were questioning his race.\n\nKamala Harris is facing some of that\u2014the purposeful mispronunciation of her name by many Republicans at the recent Republican National Convention, this making of her as an other, the mispronunciation of the name to make it sound more foreign.\n\nAnd it plays perhaps even better in an environment where anti-immigrant sentiment is flourishing, and her parents were immigrants to the United States.\n\nQ: At the recent National Association of Black Journalists convention, Trump said he didn\u2019t know Harris \u201cwas Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black and now she wants to be known as Black.\u201d What are your thoughts on Trump\u2019s questioning how Harris identifies herself?\n\nA: She\u2019s always embraced that part of her identity, even since she was a little girl. She went to an HBCU, Howard University; she belongs to a Black sorority; and she has always identified herself as both Black and South Asian.\n\nI think he is appealing to Black voters who might be open to the notion that she uses Black identity in a sort of political, pragmatic way, and she\u2019s not really invested in it.\n\nOr it\u2019s the appeal to his base of voters, which is primarily [a] white, working-class, rural base of voters and, again, this further othering of her.\n\nQ: Harris does have a diverse racial identity. Obama\u2019s identity is also diverse, but in a different way: his mother was white and, like all other presidents have been, he\u2019s a man. How do you think Harris\u2019s own identity, including her being a woman, will make it easier or more difficult for her to win?\n\nA: I think the woman part is huge in terms of what makes her different from Obama. I think that in this moment, where reproductive rights are so front and center, I think that only plays to the advantage of the Democrats.\n\nI\u2019m thinking about JD Vance and his cat ladies comment \u2026 the sort of retrograde thinking about women and childless individuals and some other things, too, are probably a net positive for her.\n\nBut at the same time, [it\u2019s] not all that beneficial to be running as the first woman who might possibly be president because of all of the misogyny.\n\nNo one was talking about George Washington, our first president, who had no biological children, being a cat lady or anything like that.\n\nQ: Obama, when he was running and in office, seemed to avoid talking about race. But since he left office, George Floyd was murdered and DEI programs\u2014and backlash to them\u2014spread throughout universities and other parts of society. Some Republicans have now called Harris a \u201cDEI hire.\u201d What do you make of this line of attack, and will Harris, like Obama, avoid talking about race during her campaign\u2014or is that even an option for her like it was for Obama?\n\nA: To use [DEI] as a smear, I think the purpose is to more or less racialize the candidate or use it to other the candidate as a person who is unqualified for the job \u2026 no one is taking to task JD Vance for only being in the Senate for two years.\n\nI think the whole DEI discourse around her is racial and, to a certain degree, sexist dog whistling to say that this is not a Black woman\u2019s\u2014this is not a woman of color\u2019s\u2014job.\n\nQ: If Harris wins, do you expect Trumpism and the MAGA movement to fade away, or do you expect an even stronger Tea Party\u2013 or MAGA-type wave in response?\n\nA: I think we will have multiple Americas and multiple visions of what it means to be America \u2026 as a national movement that\u2019s able to capture the White House\u2014I don\u2019t know about that if Trump loses this time.\n\nI think that\u2019s one of those wait-and-sees, whether you can have Trumpism without Trump or whether the Republican Party has some reckoning.",

        "text": "Weighing the impact of a potential Trump victory\nElections (and other geopolitical events) do not typically have a lasting impact on equity markets. But short-term impacts can be meaningful, and you\u2019d be forgiven if you thought this time might be different.\n\nAt this point, we mostly expect a continuation of the status quo under a Harris administration, though she has announced policy proposals for housing, taxes and other priorities in August. Meanwhile, the Republican party released its updated policy agenda during the Republican National Convention in July. Here, we analyze four key issues \u2013 trade policy, taxes, immigration and industrial spending \u2013 that could change the status quo should former President Trump be re-elected.\n\nTrade policy: How might tariffs impact growth and inflation?\n\nTrump and Biden have used tariffs (taxes paid by U.S. importers of foreign goods) to bolster national defense and increase the global competitiveness of domestic industries. Trump now advocates a 10% baseline tariff on all imported goods and a 60% (or higher) tariff on goods from China. But if Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs were fully implemented, they could lower real U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) by 0.3% to 0.5% in 2025, according to our calculations.\n\nSweeping tariffs could also deliver a one-time shock to inflation, but this sharp immediate impact would likely fade over time. More \u2013 and faster \u2013 permitting and leasing in the oil and gas complex could also provide a disinflationary offset, possibly pushing oil prices down 10% to 15% if supply rises.\n\nWe estimate that the net impact of tariffs and lower energy prices could lead to a 1.5% to 2% jump in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on a year-on-year basis. These reflationary expectations are likely one of the reasons that interest rates rose and the yield curve steepened when betting odds for a Trump presidency increased.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that the final impact of tariffs could be more modest than our estimates suggest. The proposals could be narrowed, and will likely spark legal challenges, as they have previously. Further, the impact could lessen if the tariffs are staggered over time or if custom duties are recycled into targeted industry subsidies that help companies from passing on the costs to consumers.\n\nOur analysis finds that if Trump\u2019s proposals were fully implemented, the impact on major trading peers would be less inflationary than in the United States, but likely more detrimental to growth. Said differently, we expect tariffs to slow growth disproportionately for goods exporters and raise inflation disproportionately for goods importers. For example, we estimate a potential 0.7% hit to eurozone GDP, roughly twice as large as in the United States, but just a 0.2% (or less) increase in European inflation.\n\nSuch divergence could have implications for the relative monetary policy stance in each region and thus, the euro-U.S. dollar exchange rate. In isolation, Trump\u2019s tariff policy would likely continue to underpin U.S. dollar strength.\n\nTaxes: Which 2017 tax cuts might be extended?\n\nWhoever wins the November U.S. election, the individual provisions of the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act (TCJA) will expire at the end of 2025. If they are not extended, tax rates for most individual taxpayers would rise between 1% and 4%. The law\u2019s corporate tax cut, which lowered rates from 35% to 21%, has no sunset provision.\n\nTrump has said that he would like to extend the law in its entirety, and has even proposed lowering the corporate rate further. Harris has said she would not raise taxes on individuals earning less than $400,000 a year.\n\nIf all the TCJA\u2019s provisions are extended, we would expect near-term growth expectations to rise as high as +0.7% of real GDP. Higher growth comes at the cost of an even higher fiscal deficit. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the fiscal deficit would increase by nearly $5 trillion from fiscal years 2025 to 2034 (as a share of GDP, this would be equivalent to a roughly 1.4 percentage point sustained increase in the fiscal deficit). Of course, rising deficits would only exacerbate the U.S. government\u2019s already elevated levels of federal debt.\n\nAt the moment, neither party looks poised to dramatically reduce the U.S. debt burden. That dynamic, along with the potential for growth upside from even lower tax rates, could put further upward pressure on longer-dated yields and keep bond market volatility high into 2025.",

Lichtman, the American University historian who predicted the outcome of virtually all recent U.S. elections and became famous when he accurately forecast \u2014 against what pollsters were saying \u2014 that Donald Trump would win in 2016, was very cautions when I interviewed him about the 2024 presidential race.\n\nBut, while cautioning that he will issue his official prediction after Labor Day, he gave me a good hint of who has the best chances of winning the race between Democratic hopeful Kamala Harris and Trump.\n\nLichtman, who has developed a system of 13 keys to predict elections \u2014 which he says is more accurate than polls \u2014 told me that \u201ca lot would have to go wrong for the Democratic Party to lose.\u201d Translation: as of now, Harris has the best chances of winning.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLichtman\u2019s prediction system consists of 13 questions that have to be answered each with a \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cfalse.\u201d If the incumbent party gets a \u201cfalse\u201d in six of the 13 keys, it will lose the White House.\n\nSince he started announcing his forecasts 20 years ago, he was right in nine of the last 10 elections. He says he was actually right in all 10 of them, because the 2000 election was atypical: his pick, Al Gore, won the popular vote, but the Supreme Court gave the election to George W. Bush.\n\nAmong Lichtman\u2019s 13 keys are whether there is an incumbent president running for office, whether there is a strong third-party candidate and whether the economy is doing well.\n\n\u201cRight now the Democrats are down in only three keys\u201d of the six that would be needed for them to lose the election, Lichtman told me. The Democrats are down in the \u201cmandate\u201d key, because they lost the House in the 2022 elections, in the \u201cincumbency\u201d key, because Joe Biden is no longer the candidate, and in the \u201ccharisma\u201d key, because it\u2019s too early to tell whether Harris is charismatic, he explained.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWon\u2019t Trump win the \u201ccharisma\u201d key, as horrible a human being as many of us think he is? I asked Licthman.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t fit the definition of the (charisma) key,\u201d Lichtman responded, \u201cThe keys require that you be broadly appealing. You can\u2019t just appeal to a narrow base like Trump.\u201d\n\nLichtman says that he doesn\u2019t pay attention to the polls because they are just a snapshot of the present, which is not useful to predict what will happen on Election Day.\n\nIn addition, just as pollsters underestimated the pro-Trump vote in 2016, they may now be under-estimating the pro-Democratic vote, he said.\n\n\u201cPollsters say, \u2018You know, our error margin is randomly plus or minus 3% approximately.\u2019 But that\u2019s pure statistical error,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople may lie. They may not have made up their mind yet. They may change their mind.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAs for surveys on donors\u2019 campaign contributions, crowd sizes or debates, he told me, \u201cRemember, based on conventional measures, Hillary Clinton should have won in 2016: She raised more money, had more ads, won all the debates, had a better organization. And, of course, she lost.\u201d\n\nWill Lichtman be right this time again? I have no intention of getting into the election forecasting business, but here\u2019s my humble guess: Harris will easily win the popular vote, and Trump \u2014 if he loses in the electoral college \u2014 will dispute the results.\n\nHe is already preparing the ground for contesting the election by saying Harris staged an alleged illegal \u201ccoup\u201d against Biden\u2019s nomination, still refuses to accept his defeat in the 2020 elections, and routinely praises the insurrectionists who occupied the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in an effort to revert the election results.\n\nOn top of that, Trump has not yet committed to accepting a potential adverse result in this year\u2019s elections. He doesn\u2019t play by the rules of democracy, or decency. So, whatever happens, my prediction is that it will be a big mess.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the \u201cOppenheimer Presenta\u201d TV show on Sundays at 9 pm E.T. on CNN en Espa\u00f1ol.

        "text": "What election polls show about Christian support for Trump, Harris \u2013 Deseret News\nPennsylvania Republican gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano, right, and Christopher Burch with his daughter Sophia Burch, 4, left, vote at their polling place, the New LIFE Worship Center Church of God, in Fayetteville, Pa., Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2022.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has long had strong support from evangelical voters, but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s running away with the Christian vote in the 2024 election.\n\nTwo new national surveys show that some of the country\u2019s largest faith groups actually express somewhat similar levels of support for Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nA Deseret News/HarrisX national poll found that, if the 2024 presidential election were held today, 51% of Christians would vote for Trump, while 41% would vote for Harris.\n\nThat gap does widen if you zoom in on responses from evangelical Protestants (68% for Trump vs. 30% for Harris), but Harris is a more popular choice among non-evangelical Protestants (37% for Trump vs. 55% for Harris).\n\nAdditionally, the HarrisX research showed that Catholics are split between the two candidates, with 46% saying they\u2019d vote for Trump if the election were held today and 46% saying they\u2019d vote for Harris.\n\nThe new HarrisX poll was fielded from Aug. 2-3 among 1,011 registered voters. The margin of error for the total sample is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, and it\u2019s higher when you break out individual faith groups.\n\nRelated What Donald Trump has said about his faith\n\nA new Washington Post-ABC-Ipsos poll identified similar trends, showing that Trump outperforms Harris among white Christians but not among Black or Hispanic Christians.\n\nSeventy-eight percent of white evangelical Protestants in that poll said they would vote for Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, if the 2024 presidential election were held today, but that figure falls to 54% if you look at white mainline Protestants.\n\nHarris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz are much more popular than Trump and Vance among Black Protestants (89% vs. 9%) and slightly more popular than them among Hispanic Catholics (50% vs. 47%), according to the survey.\n\nThe Post-ABC-Ipsos poll was conducted from Aug. 9-13 among 1,975 registered voters. The margin of error for the full sample is plus or minus 2.5 percentage points.\n\nWhat religion is Donald Trump?\n\nTrump grew up Presbyterian, which is one of many mainline Protestant denominations, but began identifying as a nondenominational Christian while in the White House, as the Deseret News previously reported.\n\nHowever, multiple surveys have shown that Christian support for Trump doesn\u2019t primarily stem from him being seen as devout.\n\nInstead, he\u2019s been embraced because he\u2019s seen as a defender of faith, someone who will use his power to protect religious institutions.\n\nWhat religion is Kamala Harris?\n\nFewer polls have been done about the faith-related appeal of Harris, since she only became the Democratic nominee for president within the past month.\n\nShe identifies as a Baptist, but she grew up attending Hindu temples in addition to Christian churches and married a Jewish man, Douglas Emhoff, as an adult, as the Deseret News previously reported.",

The document, updated every four years or so, is so highly classified that there are no electronic copies, only a small number of hard copies distributed to a few national security officials and Pentagon commanders.\n\nBut in recent speeches, two senior administration officials were allowed to allude to the change \u2014 in carefully constrained, single sentences \u2014 ahead of a more detailed, unclassified notification to Congress expected before Mr. Biden leaves office.",

        "text": "DNC day four: Harris speech to provide finale to Democratic convention\nHarris speech to provide finale to Democratic convention on day four\n\nWatch: Katty Kay's three things to watch for in Harris's convention speech\n\nDemocrats will gather in Chicago on Thursday night where Vice-President Kamala Harris will make the biggest speech of her life, as she readies herself for the sprint before November's presidential election. On the final day of the Democratic National Convention, Ms Harris will formally accept her party's nomination - following a ceremonial roll call earlier in the week during which state delegates confirmed their support. Her running mate Tim Walz spoke on Wednesday night, making a personal pitch to middle America by giving a \"pep talk\" in the vein of an American football coach. US political conventions, which happen every four years before a presidential election, date back to the 1830s, when a group of Democratic delegates supporting President Andrew Jackson gathered to nominate him for a second term. Here\u2019s what to know about the 2024 DNC, which has been attended by thousands of people.\n\nWhat's to come on Thursday?\n\nThe convention has all been building up to Thursday night. When she takes the stage, Vice-President Harris will formally accept the presidential nomination, and give a speech looking ahead to November. It will be the most significant address of her political career. Ms Harris became the Democratic nominee after President Joe Biden stepped aside and gave her his backing, following weeks of pressure from party members. Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, who both represent swing states, are also expected to speak on Thursday - as is high-profile Republican Adam Kinzinger.\n\nWho spoke on Wednesday?\n\nDemocratic National Convention: Oprah and Bill Clinton turn out on Tim Walz's big day\n\nWednesday night was Mr Walz's first significant opportunity to introduce himself to the nation - and specifically to connect with middle America. His speech was heavy on his personal story, including the importance of his family, his teaching career and time spent coaching a high-school football team, his stint in Army National Guard, and his service as a congressman and Minnesota governor. Long-time TV host Oprah Winfrey made a surprise appearance, receiving a raucous response and urging Americans to \"choose truth\" in the upcoming vote. Other prominent Democrats who featured on the same night included grandees Bill Clinton, the former president, and Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker. There were also appearances by rising stars such as Josh Shapiro, the governor of the swing state of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Obamas addressed the convention on Tuesday night\n\nEarlier in the week, the convention heard from President Joe Biden, who stepped aside last month for Ms Harris to contest the presidency. On Monday, he gave an emotional defence of his time in the White House: \"America, I gave my best to you.\" The same evening, Hillary Clinton, the 2016 presidential candidate, took the stage and voiced her hope that Ms Harris could finally break the \u201chighest, hardest glass ceiling\u201d in the US by becoming the first female president. During back-to-back speeches on Tuesday, Barack and Michelle Obama mixed gags with serious exhortations to Democrats to get out and vote in November. \"Hope is making a comeback,\" said Mrs Obama. This was a contrast with the \"chaos\" of Donald Trump's time in the White House, Mr Obama added. And Trump's former spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham gave a speech of her own criticising her ex-boss. America's Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff was introduced to the stage on the same night by his son Cole, who called him a \"goofy dad\". Mr Emhoff went on to laud his wife, Ms Harris, as the \"right person\" for him and the presidency alike.\n\nWhat's the purpose of the DNC?\n\nBecause Ms Harris and Mr Walz were already nominated ahead of the event, and the roll call was a formality, this year's convention has been focused on speeches and the adoption of the party\u2019s policy platform. Delegates have been working in the daytimes to finalise the platform, a draft of which has already been released. It focuses on a broad range of issues, including plans to lower inflation, mitigate climate change and tackle gun violence. In the draft, Democrats contrast each of the party positions with Project 2025, an ultra-conservative blueprint for what a second Trump administration could look like, authored by the Heritage Foundation. Trump has sought to distance himself from the project, though several of his allies were involved in writing it.\n\nWatch: Ione Wells explains why Democrats hope influencers can be an election secret weapon\n\nHow can I follow coverage?\n\nMembers of the public can only attend the convention in person by becoming volunteers. But as with the Republican convention, there is plenty of national media coverage, and the convention itself has been offering live-streams on social media platforms. You can follow BBC News coverage - featuring on-site reporting and analysis - across the website and app, and on our livestream. The BBC News Channel is carrying special coverage from 20:00 ET (01:00 BST) each night. You can find special episodes of The Global Story and Americast podcasts on BBC Sounds and other podcast platforms. Sign up to North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's election newsletter US Election Unspun for his take on the week's events direct to your inbox.\n\nWho else is in attendance?\n\nLil Jon raps for Georgia roll call in support of Harris\n\nAbout 50,000 people are thought to have travelled to the event in Chicago. They include thousands of delegates chosen by state Democratic parties, as well as party grandees and some members of the Democratic National Committee. As with the equivalent Republican event last month, which featured famous faces as well, the DNC has been a star-studded affair. Winfrey and Lil Jon have been joined by musicians Stevie Wonder, John Legend and Lil Jon, and comedian Mindy Kaling. Rumours have swirled about whether mega-stars Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor Swift will make appearances themselves, but neither has confirmed anything.\n\nWhat about the protests?\n\nEPA A mostly peaceful protest unfolded on Monday\n\nDemonstrations have been taking place outside the convention centre, focusing on opposition to US support of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. A further demonstration is planned on Thursday. On Wednesday, a group of delegates who were denied the chance to speak at the convention began a sit-in outside the arena. The delegates, selected in state Democratic primaries earlier this year, have pledged themselves \"uncommitted\" to any presidential candidate as part of an internal protest over Gaza. Earlier in the week, a protest on Tuesday near Chicago's Israeli consulate culminated in scuffles between demonstrators and police and led to several arrests. And thousands of marchers took to the streets for a mostly peaceful protest on Monday, calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and an end to US support for Israel. Several were arrested when dozens of them broke through a security fence. In that night's address, Mr Biden acknowledged that the activists \"have a point\", going on to say that \"a lot of innocent people are being killed, on both sides\".\n\nThe route that has been taken by protesters",

        "text": "Black voters support Harris over Trump and Kennedy by a wide margin\nBlack registered voters overwhelmingly support Vice President Kamala Harris over former President Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in the presidential race.\n\nAbout three-quarters of Black voters (77%) say they would vote for or lean toward Harris if the 2024 presidential election were held today. Another 13% say they would back or lean toward Trump. Just 7% would support or lean toward Kennedy, according to a Pew Research Center survey of U.S. adults conducted Aug. 5-11 (before the start of the Democratic National Convention).\n\nBlack voters\u2019 support for the top of the Democratic ticket has increased over the past month. In July, before President Joe Biden withdrew from the race and endorsed Harris, 64% of Black voters supported Biden.\n\nMeanwhile, the share of Black voters who say they support Trump has not changed, and the share who prefer Kennedy has fallen from 21% to 7%.\n\nHow we did this Pew Research Center conducted this analysis to understand Black voters\u2019 views of the 2024 presidential race and the candidates running. This analysis is part of a larger study, for which we surveyed 9,201 adults \u2013 including 7,569 registered voters \u2013 from Aug. 5 to 11, 2024. The survey included 863 Black adults, 681 of whom were registered voters. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), a group of people recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses who have agreed to take surveys regularly. This kind of recruitment gives nearly all U.S. adults a chance of selection. Surveys were conducted either online or by telephone with a live interviewer. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other factors. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology. Here are the questions used for this analysis, the topline and the survey methodology.\n\nDemographic differences in Black voters\u2019 support for Harris\n\nBlack voters differ by age in their support for Harris. While 86% of Black voters 50 and older back her, a smaller share of Black voters 18 to 49 (68%) say the same.\n\nThese age differences are consistent with those for Biden in an April 2024 survey. However, this is different from the pattern among registered voters of all races and ethnicities, where support for Harris is slightly higher among those 18 to 49 (49%) than those 50 and older (44%).\n\nBlack voters with college degrees are also more likely than those without degrees to support Harris (84% vs. 74%). This is similar to the pattern for voters overall, where Harris gets more support from college graduates (56%) than she does from those without bachelor\u2019s degrees (41%).\n\nIn contrast, there are no significant differences by gender in Black voters\u2019 support for Harris.\n\nMore Black voters view Harris favorably now than in the spring\n\nAbout eight-in-ten Black voters (79%) have a favorable opinion of Harris, and a similar share (80%) are happy that she is now the Democratic nominee for president.\n\nWhile the shares of Black voters who have a favorable view of Biden (68%) and Trump (14%) have held relatively steady since July 2023, the share who have a positive view of Harris has increased.\n\nRoughly two-thirds of Black voters had a favorable view of Harris in July 2023 (65%) and May 2024 (67%).

        "text": "Impact of the 2024 US Presidential Election on the Transport and Logistics Market\nAsstrA, an international transport and logistics company, has analyzed the potential impacts of the 2024 US Presidential Election on the transportation and logistics industry. The 2024 US Presidential Election stands as a critical juncture with far-reaching consequences for global markets. The trajectory of US policies on trade, the environment, fiscal matters, and foreign relations will influence the global economic landscape, impacting market stability, international trade patterns, and investments in ecological initiatives.\n\nInfrastructure Investment\n\nIf the Democratic Party wins: The Democratic Party's emphasis on substantial infrastructure investments, including roads, bridges, and ports, could greatly enhance transportation networks. A focus on sustainable projects, promoting electric vehicles (EVs), and expanding EV charging networks could drive the logistics sector toward more environmentally friendly operations.\n\nIf the Republican Party wins: A Republican administration might continue to support traditional infrastructure projects. While this could improve transportation networks, it might not prioritize sustainability to the same extent.\n\n\n\nRegulation and Compliance\n\nIf the Democratic Party wins: Stricter environmental regulations under the Democratic administration could lead to higher compliance costs for transport companies but also incentivize innovation in cleaner technologies. Additionally, there could be an increase in labor and safety regulations impacting the industry.\n\n\n\nIf the Republican Party wins: A Republican administration may continue to roll back environmental regulations, potentially lowering compliance costs for transport companies but possibly affecting the push toward sustainable logistics practices. Policies might favor employer flexibility over strict labor regulations.\n\n\n\nTrade Policies\n\nIf the Democratic Party wins: A Democratic administration is likely to support re-engagement with international trade partners and institutions, potentially reducing trade barriers and creating more stable trade relationships. This could encourage domestic production, altering supply chains with a potential increase in domestic transport and logistics needs.\n\nIf the Republican Party wins: The Republican Party's protectionist trade measures could lead to trade tariffs and barriers, complicating international logistics, and increasing costs and uncertainties in global supply chains. Ongoing renegotiation of trade agreements might create a volatile trade environment.\n\n\n\nPreparing for potential supply chain disruptions\n\nThe first months of 2024 have already strained U.S. supply chains due to various global disruptions. The upcoming presidential election in November adds to the uncertainty, with potential impacts on the U.S. economy and supply chains. Predicting these effects is challenging due to the complexity of factors involved, such as candidates' policies, the economic climate, and political polarization.\n\nPresidential elections consistently create additional risks and disruptions to supply chains. Historical data shows mixed impacts: the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic overshadowed election effects, while the 2016 election caused trade policy uncertainty. In contrast, the 2012 election saw no significant election-related disruptions, and the 2008 financial crisis had a broader impact on supply chains than the election itself.\n\n\n\nKey areas where the 2024 election might influence supply chains include trade policy, infrastructure improvements, regulations, labor laws, and immigration policies. Trade policies can affect the cost and flow of goods, while infrastructure upgrades can enhance transportation efficiency. Regulatory changes and labor laws impact production costs and worker availability. Immigration policies might exacerbate existing labor shortages, particularly in warehouses. Economic policies stemming from the election can influence consumer confidence and spending, potentially causing temporary disruptions in certain sectors.\n\n\n\nThe Impact of U.S. Trade Policies on Global Trade Dynamics\n\nHistorically, the U.S. approach to trade agreements and tariffs has significantly influenced international trade. In 2018, the Republican administration's \"trade war\" tariffs on Chinese imports affected over USD 360 billion worth of goods, disrupting global supply chains and causing a 0.3% dip in global GDP, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The Republicans have pledged to increase these tariffs if re-elected. Surprisingly, the Democratic administration has largely maintained these tariffs during its term but has ramped up criticism of Republican trade policies, promising a drastically different approach if re-elected.\n\n\n\nTrade partners of both China and the United States could experience substantial gains or losses depending on the election outcome and subsequent trade policy changes. For instance, the 2018 increase in U.S. restrictions on Chinese imports allowed Mexico's export share to the U.S. to rise, making it the top U.S. import source this year, surpassing China. On the other hand, Europe struggled to capitalize on U.S.-China trade tensions due to its continued dependence on Chinese supply chains. Despite efforts to \"de-risk\" by reducing investments in China, Europe\u2019s reliance on Chinese manufacturing and supplies remains a hurdle in meeting U.S. import demands and benefiting from potential policy shifts.\n\nGlobal climate leadership and renewable energy investments\n\nA similarly impactful point of contention is the U.S.'s leadership role in climate change initiatives. The American re-entry into the Paris Agreement under the Democratic administration marked a significant shift towards prioritizing climate change on the global stage. This move, alongside the controversial tax-credit-gifting Inflation Reduction Act, has spurred global investments in renewable energy. Due to the U.S.'s size and wealth, manufacturers worldwide are eager to access the American market, with global renewable investments increasing by nearly 50% across all categories since these climate spending policies were enacted in 2021.\n\nThe Republican administration\u2019s skepticism toward some of these extensive climate spending measures stems from a geoeconomic perspective. One area of concern is the rapid adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). Many Western nations, including the U.S., have delayed pro-EV policies due to fears of China's control over essential EV components. The Republicans have already endorsed a reversal and \"then some\" of Democratic climate policies but have not yet addressed whether they would attempt to leave the Paris Agreement again.\n\n\n\nWith both parties firmly committed to their opposing views on the U.S.'s role in the climate debate, America's choice in November is bound to have significant repercussions for international energy markets and green technology investments for at least the next four years.\n\nSources\n\nhttps://www.gtreview.com/magazine/volume-19-issue-1/us-trade-policy-global-impact-biden-presidency/\n\nhttps://www.capitaleconomics.com/key-issues/us-election-2024\n\nhttps://thelondonfinancial.com/economics/how-the-2024-us-presidential-election-will-affect-global-markets\n\nhttps://www.freightwaves.com/news/2024-presidential-election-may-have-big-impact-on-supply-chains\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/pulse/potential-impacts-2024-us-presidential-election-supply-luis-juarez--j3xqe/\n\nhttps://futuresupplychains.org/long-read-a-year-of-elections-but-supply-chain-fragmentation-will-continue/\n\nhttps://www.racetothewh.com/president/polls#google_vignette\n\nhttps://elections2024.thehill.com/forecast/2024/president/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_2024_United_States_presidential_election\n\nhttps://politicalpulse.net/us-politics/alan-lichtmans-prediction-for-2024/",

        "text": "Supreme Court grants GOP bid to require citizenship proof for some Arizona voters\nSupreme Court grants GOP bid to require citizenship proof for some Arizona voters\n\ntoggle caption Matt York/AP\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday delivered a mixed ruling on a controversial Arizona voting law.\n\nThe Republican National Committee had asked the court to put a pause on a lower court ruling against the 2022 law. And in a 5-4 decision, the high court granted part of that request, allowing Arizona to enforce \u2014 for now \u2014 a section that requires election officials to reject state voter registration forms that are submitted without an applicant\u2019s proof of U.S. citizenship. That provision will remain in effect as an appeal proceeds.\n\nBut the court rejected other aspects of Republicans' request that could have blocked tens of thousands of currently registered voters from voting in this fall\u2019s presidential election.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe order from the conservative-majority high court is part of a legal fight over voter registration requirements in the key swing state, where in 2020, President Biden defeated former President Donald Trump by slightly over 10,000 votes .\n\nThe ruling comes just weeks before voting starts in what is expected to be a close presidential election \u2014 and amid a growing GOP push for voters to show proof of their citizenship when signing up to cast a ballot in federal elections, which many election experts warn could make voting more difficult for many eligible voters .\n\nTwo dozen Republican state attorneys general, led by Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach and West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, backed the RNC\u2019s emergency request to the Supreme Court with a friend-of-the-court brief .\n\nIn a statement, RNC Chairman Michael Whatley called the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling \u201ca major victory for election integrity that upholds a simple principle: American elections must be decided by American citizens.\u201d\n\nStudies have shown that noncitizen voting in state and federal elections remains vanishingly rare .\n\nArizona Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said that his office, which is named in the lawsuit, respects the court\u2019s decision and \u201cwill implement these changes while continuing to protect voter access.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"My concern is that changes to the process should not occur this close to an election, it creates confusion for voters,\u201d Fontes added in a statement.\n\nWith voter registration for this fall\u2019s general election in Arizona set to end on Oct. 7, Patty Ferguson-Bohnee \u2014 a law professor at Arizona State University and member of the Pointe-au-Chien Indian tribe, who has served as Arizona\u2019s Native vote election protection coordinator \u2014 says the timing of the Supreme Court\u2019s order is likely to add another hurdle to outreach groups who may have to adjust how they help eligible voters get signed up to vote.\n\n\u201cPeople have been ramping up their voter registration efforts. A lot of groups and organizations and counties have been trained on the voter registration process, so I think it will create a little bit of confusion,\u201d Ferguson-Bohnee says. \u201cAnd then, if a voter is registering, they're not going to be aware that, \u2018Oh, there is a federal form, and there's a state form. And it may actually make a difference as to whether I'm actually registered to vote, depending on which form I use.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\n\n2 different forms make Arizona voter registration complicated\n\nArizona has a complicated, two-track system for registering voters in which two different forms \u2014 a state one and a federal one \u2014 are accepted, with different requirements. The system stems from a decades-long dispute over the need for proof of citizenship.\n\nState law requires showing documentary proof when registering to vote in state and local elections. Before Thursday\u2019s Supreme Court ruling, any eligible voter who submitted the state\u2019s registration form without citizenship proof would be registered for only federal elections, unless election officials could access a record of citizenship proof the voter previously provided to Arizona\u2019s Motor Vehicle Division.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in 2013 that the state had to accept and use a standard federal form required by the National Voter Registration Act . That form does not require proof but calls for applicants to swear under penalty of perjury that they are U.S. citizens.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn 2022, however, Arizona\u2019s GOP-controlled legislature passed a new law that bans registered voters who have not provided proof of their citizenship from voting in presidential elections or by mail for any federal office, like U.S. Senate.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department and civil rights organizations led by Mi Familia Vota sued, and following a 10-day trial, U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton struck down that restriction after finding that it is preempted by the National Voter Registration Act, which Congress passed in 1993 to make the registration process easier for eligible voters. Bolton\u2019s decision cited a 1976 Supreme Court decision that said the high court has recognized \u201cbroad congressional power to legislate in connection with the elections of the President and Vice President.\u201d\n\nThe Republican National Committee, along with Arizona\u2019s top GOP state lawmakers, appealed Bolton\u2019s ruling to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The Republicans argue that the U.S. Constitution\u2019s Electors Clause limits Congress\u2019 role in regulating presidential elections and that Arizona\u2019s state legislature has, as attorneys for the RNC and the GOP lawmakers wrote in a Supreme Court filing , \u201csovereign authority to determine the qualifications of voters and structure participation in its elections.\u201d Still, this month, a panel of 9th Circuit judges declined to put a pause on the lower court\u2019s ruling.\n\nAccording to the Arizona secretary of state\u2019s office , 42,301 voters in the state were registered for only federal elections, as of July 1.\n\nWhether those registered voters are allowed to vote in future presidential elections after this fall\u2019s race without showing proof of citizenship remains an open legal question.\n\nOral arguments before the 9th Circuit are scheduled for Sept. 10 in San Francisco, and attorneys for the RNC have signaled in court filings they\u2019re preparing to eventually ask the Supreme Court to take up this case.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn the Supreme Court\u2019s order, at least three conservative justices \u2014 Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch \u2014 signaled interest in weighing in more fully on the citizenship-proof requirement for Arizona\u2019s state registration forms.",

        "text": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is considering ending presidential campaign, 2 sources say\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. is considering ending his presidential candidacy in the coming days, according to two sources familiar with his campaign, though he has not yet made a final decision.\n\nOn Wednesday, his campaign director, Amaryllis Fox, sent an email to staff thanking them for their contributions to the campaign and informing them that Kennedy was mulling over suspending his campaign.\n\n\"What I've heard from my friends on the campaign is that Bobby is torn. The word that keeps coming up is 'torn.' Ultimately, I think he will endorse Trump,\" said Link Lauren, a former senior adviser to the campaign, in an interview with CBS News.\n\nLate Thursday, CBS News learned that RFK Jr. will not appear on Arizona's ballot despite qualifying this week. His campaign filed new paperwork Thursday to withdraw his candidacy.\n\n\"He won't appear on any ballot,\" a spokesperson with the Arizona Secretary of State's Office told CBS News in a text message.\n\nKennedy's campaign announced on his website that he plans to address the nation on Friday \"about the present historical moment and his path forward.\" ABC News reported that RFK Jr. is expected to end his campaign.\n\nAccording to a source familiar with the campaign, Kennedy realizes he has no path to victory, and the campaign's funding is drying up. His advisers are split, with some encouraging him to drop out and endorse former President Donald Trump, while others urge him to keep running. His wife, Cheryl Hines, dislikes Trump and does not want Kennedy to support him. Cheryl has publicly expressed her dislike of Trump, telling TMZ in February, when asked if she would support RFK on the ticket with Trump, \"I think Bobby knows me very well,\" and laughed when TMZ responded, \"I think that's our answer.\"\n\nSome of those encouraging him to continue running are well-paid by the campaign, including Del Bigtree, the campaign's communications director, who was paid $20,000 in July, and Charles Eisenstein, the campaign's director of messaging, who received $21,667 last month, according to financial filings.\n\nHowever, Kennedy's campaign is over $3 million in debt. His running mate, Nicole Shanahan, has vowed to fund Kennedy's ballot access efforts, including fighting legal challenges brought forward by Democratic Party allies. According to the campaign, Kennedy only needs to submit signatures in four more states, bringing his ballot access efforts close to an end.\n\nShanahan told Tom Bilyeu on the \"Impact Theory\" podcast that Kennedy was considering supporting GOP nominee Donald Trump. She expressed concern that staying in the race might \"draw votes from Trump\" and raised the possibility of \"walking away right now and joining forces with him.\"\n\nShanahan posted on social media on Thursday that \"my old Dem buddies have been flooding me with frantic calls, texts, and emails.\"\n\n\"The message is clear: they're terrified of the idea of our movement joining forces with Donald Trump,\" Shanahan said. \"When I point out what the Democratic Party and their super PACs have done to sabotage our campaign, their response is always, 'but Trump is worse.' Here's an idea: stop suing us. Let us debate. Quit rigging the media and the polls. It's a simple formula, people\u2014get with it.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Shanahan said on the \"Ask Dr. Drew\" podcast, \"I think that Friday is going to be one of the biggest events in American election history.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. JD Vance, Trump's running mate, told CBS News that he would welcome an endorsement from Kennedy.\n\n\"I think it's a great endorsement for the president to have,\" Vance told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor and managing editor Norah O'Donnell on Wednesday. \"I don't know if it's actually going to happen, but I'd certainly welcome it and encourage RFK to join the team.\"\n\nA source close to Trump told CBS News' Robert Costa that any Trump endorsement by Kennedy would be about \"Bobby coming to us\" and \"offering support\" due to his own conclusions about a path forward, not about Trump making a deal or promise to the presidential candidate.\n\nIn July, Kennedy's son released a video of a speakerphone conversation RFK Jr. had with Trump, in which the former president could be heard agreeing with Kennedy's discredited views on vaccines before trying to convince him to endorse his campaign.\n\n\"I would love you to do something. And I think it'll be so good for you and so big for you,\" Trump told Kennedy. \"And we're going to win,\" he added.\n\nKennedy's campaign has not yet responded to a request for comment.\n\nKennedy also recently approached Vice President Kamala Harris's presidential campaign to discuss the possibility of serving in her administration, two sources familiar with the situation told CBS News, but Harris and her advisers did not agree to meet him.\n\n\"No one has any intention of negotiating with a MAGA-funded fringe candidate who has sought out a job with Donald Trump in exchange for an endorsement,\" one Harris campaign source said.\n\nIn response to the possibility that Kennedy could end his presidential bid, the Democratic National Committee issued a statement saying, \"desperate men do desperate things.\"\n\n\"RFK Jr. was recruited by MAGA, funded by MAGA, and parroted MAGA talking points. No one should be shocked if he formalizes his relationship in an attempt to maintain relevance,\" said Mary Beth Cahill, a DNC senior adviser.\n\nand contributed to this report.",

        "text": "US presidential election: Harris rolls out the blue carpet for influencers\nAn influencer at the United Center for the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Illinois, on August 19, 2024. CHENEY ORR / REUTERS\n\nThe Democratic National Convention has never been \"the place to be.\" At least not until this year, judging by the videos of the influencers who have been parading down the blue carpet of Chicago's United Center since Monday, August 19, taking selfies with delegates, sipping a glass of champagne on a luxury boat or screaming their hearts out at Barack Obama's arrival on stage, wearing their \"Harris Walz\" caps.\n\nFor the first time, 200 content creators were accredited by the Democratic Party to cover the convention, with unprecedented access to events and guests, similar to that of journalists. Five of them were offered an appearance on stage \u2013 the same stage on which Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and other stars of the party have been appearing for the past three days. Among them was influencer Deja Foxx, with 140,000 followers on TikTok. In between two \"outfits of the day,\" she summed up her remarks on Monday. \"I got to shine a light on the issues that I know are top of mind for you, things like reproductive rights, cost of living, student debt,\" the young woman said emotionally to the camera that very evening in a video with whirling editing, just like her first day on site.\n\nRead more Subscribers only At the Democratic convention, the Obamas portray Harris as the American dream's embodiment\n\nThese images are the embodiment of a new strategy for the Democratic Party: reaching out to the new generation of voters where they are. \"Kamala Harris is courting these influencers because they can reach young voters who don't look at traditional media,\" said Thomas Gift, director of the Centre on US Politics at University College London. According to a Pew Research Center study from November 2023, almost half of Americans get their information, at least in part, from social media. Among those under 30, a third \"regularly\" get their news from TikTok. It's impossible for parties to \"remain deaf to the influence of these platforms,\" Gift said.\n\nDemocrats catching up\n\nDonald Trump also tried to capitalize on these pop culture personalities by inviting model Amber Rose to appear on stage at the Republican National Convention in July. The former president, already a compulsive social media user during his 2016 campaign (on Twitter at the time), also hasn't hesitated to appear alongside mega-influencers like Logan Paul or Adin Ross. Now, the Democrats are catching up with the firepower of the MAGA movement (\"Make America Great Again,\" Trump's slogan) on the internet.\n\nSince Harris entered the race for the White House on July 21, \"Kamalamania\" enthusiasts have flooded social media with humorous and creative memes about the candidate's dance steps and bursts of laughter, which in just a few weeks have become symbols of renewed Democratic enthusiasm \u2013 symbols that the party has not been shy about disseminating at the Chicago venues.\n\nRead more Subscribers only Kamala-mania brings enthusiasm back to Democratic camp\n\nYouTuber Brian Tyler Cohen believes that \"by welcoming different voices, the convention managed to break the mold of a somewhat old-fashioned, stilted event,\" and to generate interest among a very wide audience. \"On my own, I can reach 6 to 7 million people who wouldn't otherwise be interested in politics,\" he pointed out. His latest video opens with American rapper Lil Jon bursting into the convention on Tuesday night, wearing a shiny chain around his neck and dark glasses, to a few bars of \"Turn Down for What\": a \"surprise guest\" who \"rocks Day 2,\" according to the title of the video.\n\nA promise of authenticity\n\nInfluencers know how to hold their audience's attention. They also know how to earn their trust. If they have such persuasive power with their followers, \"it's because they talk to them as equals as if they were talking to a friend,\" emphasized Brian Rolling, co-founder of MurMur Impact, a group that helps young people get involved with the progressive American cause by helping them in creating online content. For him, \"authenticity\" reigns in this new form of communication, which \"could have an influence on the outcome of the November vote.\"\n\nOn Instagram, Sari Beth Rosenberg, another influencer, has been filming backstage at the convention, approaching the stars but also \"local delegates and everyday people.\" \"Let's pretend I'm your buddy there. Tell me what you want to see and I'll try to show it to you,\" she promises from the bed of her hotel room. Actress and singer Malynda Hale also guarantees \"unfiltered\" content for her 53,000 followers.\n\nGift said this apparent authenticity is not without risk. \"The regulatory framework is very vague at the moment, and nothing would oblige them to stipulate whether they were paid for these publications,\" he said. However, the influencers interviewed by Le Monde stated that they received neither compensation nor instructions from the party to cover the event.\n\nTo pay for the hotel and travel, Kory Aversa, known to his 129,000 TikTok followers as Philly Publicist, even spoke of a financial \"sacrifice.\" But \"this election is too important, I had to be there, and take my followers,\" he said. \"When Joe Biden took the stage, it was such an emotional moment, everyone cried,\" said the Philadelphia LGBTQ+ influencer. The mainstream media can tell it well, he conceded \u2013 Le Monde, for example, noted the \"tear in his eye\" \u2013 \"but watching my video, I want you to be there crying with me.\" So that maybe in November, you'll vote like him?",

        "text": "2024 US Presidential Election Media Impact Analysis \u2013 Fourth Edition\nDates covered in this report: April 1, 2024 to mi-July 2024\n\nThere are those events that live in the collective memory and are punctuated with some version of \u201cWhere were you when X happened?\u201d or \u201cI remember exactly what I was doing when X happened.\u201d\n\nGen X remember the Berlin Wall coming down, The Miracle on Ice, Challenger, Princess Diana\u2019s death and they can tell you exactly what they were doing when they heard the news. In a time before social media where news did not travel at the speed of push notifications or social post these, and other events have distinct placeholders in our collective memory.\n\nPresident Bidens decision to not seek the reelection is unprecedented. It\u2019s not that others have not chosen to run:\n\n1968 Lyndon B. Johnson, 36th president of the United States, chose not to run for reelection after single term due to his low popularity. He served as Vice President under John F. Kennedy from 1961 \u2013 1963 and became president after JFK was assassinated.\n\nHarry Truman, 33rd president of the United States, chose not to seek re-election probably due his 22% job approval rating.\n\n1928 Calvin Coolidge, 30th president of the United States, announced he would not run after his first full term would end. He had acceded to the presidency when Warren G. Harding died while in office.\n\n1904 Theodore Roosevelt, 26th president of the United States, announced he would not be running for president just soon after he was elected and despite his popularity kept his word and put his support behind William Howard Taft.\n\nJune 27, 2024 \u2013 President Joe Biden\u2019s debate performance sparked calls for him to leave the race. For 25 days the president tried to reassure his party and the American people that he was fit to run.\n\nWith the assassination attempt on former president Donald Trump on July 13th the calls for Biden to step aside accelerated. The culmination of which now sees Vice President Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket. Within 24 hours the announcement she raised a staggering $84M for her campaign. To add to that, Vice President Harris leads Trump by 2% in polling reported by Reuters on July 23rd.\n\nPresident Biden yielded to pressure with less than four months left in the campaign process. Unprecedented.\n\nWhat happened after that shows just how quickly a party can and will mobilize and rally behind a candidate.\n\nPost Announcement\n\nBiden\u2019s withdrawal from the presidential race quickly sent both parties on the offensive to make this historic announcement work to their advantage.\n\nDemocrats earned nearly 4 M social posts around these themes:\n\n-Praised President\u2019s Biden\u2019s legacy\n\n-Hailed his decision to step aside\n\n-Rallied around Vice President Kamala Harris\n\n-Praised President\u2019s Biden\u2019s legacy -Hailed his decision to step aside -Rallied around Vice President Kamala Harris Republicans earned nearly 3.5 M social posts around these themes:\n\n-Urging President Biden to resign outright\n\n-Criticized Biden\u2019s legacy on immigration and inflation\n\n-Suggested Harris lied about Biden\u2019s mental capacity\n\n-Painted Harris as soft on border security\n\nShare of voice\n\nQ2 2024 Overview\n\nIn this social media report, we analyze Q2 conversations. However, we are integrating elements from mid-July, given the exceptional events that took place.\n\nDuring the specified period, there were more than 2.89 million online mentions relating to \u2018US elections\u2019, \u2018Republicans\u2019 and \u2018Democrats\u2019. This is a significant decrease (-14%) compared to the first quarter of 2024 (3.36 million mentions).\n\nWhen all the conversations about each Republican, Democrat, Green, Libertarian, and Independent candidate are aggregated, the volume of conversations is 8.2 million mentions, down 19% compared to Q1 24. The absence of big events like in Q1 (Super Tuesday, Biden\u2019s State of the Union address, Border crisis\u2026) are the main reasons for the drop in social conversations in Q2.\n\nHowever in July the conversation about elections and candidates increased by 202% compared with June due to the assassination attempt on Donald Trump on 13 July and the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee from 15 to 18 July.\n\nAs in Q1 2024, the \u2018Democrats\u2019 received more discussions than the \u2018Republicans\u2019 during Q2, mainly due President Biden. Key topics driving these conversations include Taxes, Border Control and Immigration, Israel/Hamas conflict, Abortion, Healthcare, Economy, Taxes and Age of Candidates. All these subjects were also discussed in the many comments about the TV debate on 27 June.\n\nThe topics are different for conversations about the \u2018Republicans\u2019: there\u2019s more talk about taxes and immigration, and much less about abortion. But above all, the subject of Trump\u2019s criminal hush money case and its verdict is very present in conversations about Trump. The subject of Israel Hamas continues to generate tense conversations on both sides, surpassing on social media the volume devoted to Biden\u2019s poor performance during the debate.\n\nSocial Media Posts by Political Party\n\nThe topics that grew the most in terms of share of voice on social media compared to Q1 2024 are Tax (+2.7%), Abortion (+2.3%), Trump indictment (+2.9%), the Age of the 2 main candidates (+2%). By contrast, the Border Control topic, which grew strongly in Q1 24, is down: -7%.\n\nThe topics discussed first in terms of volume remain immigration and Israel, then the appearance in 3rd place of the subject of Taxes.\n\nIn The three main peaks of conversations about the Presidential Election in Q2 24 have to do with:\n\nMay 9: Mixed reactions to President Biden\u2019s decision to withhold certain weapons from Israel if it attacks Rafah in Gaza strip. Republicans accused Biden of favoring a \u201cHamas victory over Israel\u201d.\n\nMay 30: Donald Trump has been convicted on all 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up a sex scandal that threatened his ascent to the White House in 2016.\n\nJune 27-28: President Joe Biden\u2019s allies scrambled to contain the fallout from his poor performance in the first U.S. presidential debate of 2024. NY Times calls on Biden to drop out of 2024 presidential race. But poll shows most Democrats think Biden should keep running.\n\nIn July, the attempted assassination of Donald Trump at the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, significantly increased mentions of the elections on social media, producing a peak unseen since the start of the campaign.\n\nQ2 24 + mid-July Timeline Highlights\n\nWhich conversations have the greatest number of mentions and comments?\n\nDuring the Q2 period, more than 5.3M online mentions relate to the different presidential candidates, including more than 3.5 million for Democratic candidates and 1.5 million for Republican candidates. However, this is down significantly on Q1 24. This is due to fewer events that took place in Q1, such as Biden\u2019s State of the Union address, Super Tuesday, Border crisis or Supreme Court rulings. In addition, the number of Republican candidates has fallen sharply, with conversations focusing more on Trump and Biden alone.\n\nOn the contrary, Independent, Libertarian, and Green candidates have strongly increased their shares of voice compared to Q1 24.\n\nDiscussions about Democratic candidates decreased by 22% compared to Q1 2024. More than 99% of discussions about Democratic candidates are about Joe Biden. He receives many mentions as President but since March 8 (State of the Union address), he has been commented on as a candidate. He is distantly followed by Cenk Uygur, and Marianne Williamson (withdrew from the race on June 11).\n\nConversation Trend for Joe Biden. April-Mid-July\n\nDuring this Q2 2024, the timeline of conversations about Joe Biden on social media is dominated by immigration policy and foreign affairs.\n\nOn immigration policy, on June 4, the White House announced that President Biden believes \u201cwe must secure our border in line with our laws and values\u201d. He is announcing new executive actions to bar migrants who cross our Southern border unlawfully from receiving asylum.Tensions are so high around the Israel-Hamas conflict that every decision Biden makes in this area is widely commented on, whether positively or negatively. For example, Biden\u2019s decisions on April 5 and May 9 concerning the Gaza Strip received more mentions than his poor performance at the debate, and the doubts about whether he would remain in the race.\n\nAnother foreign affairs topic, Ukraine and the congressional vote on aid, also provoked a spike in discussion on April 22.\n\nIn addition, during Q2, candidate Biden spoke out several times on the subject of abortion. By upholding a near-total ban on abortion on April 9, the Arizona Supreme Court has rekindled the abortion debate. The Biden administration announced that it has expanded HIPAA protection to shield medical records for women seeking abortion care from state law enforcement officials seeking to prosecute people.\n\nFrom 27 June onwards, conversations focused on the President\u2019s age and cognitive faculties, because he continued to mix up people\u2019s names at his press conferences. On July 12, Joe Biden condemns the failed assassination attempt on Trump during a live televised speech and resumes his campaign on the 16th. when he accuses Trump of \u201clying like hell\u201d.\n\nThird party or independent candidates\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. remains the Independent candidate who collects the most mentions (with a share of voice of 53%). However, it is lower than in Q1 2024, due to the strong increase in share of voice for the Green candidate Jill Stein. She is now well ahead of Cornel West by progressing by more than 160% compared to Q1 24. Chase Oliver remains at a low rate of mentions on social media. Nevertheless, all these candidates have progressed compared to the first quarter of 2024, taking advantage of the withdrawal of all Republican candidates against Trump in Q1 as well as Democrat Marianne Williamson in June.\n\nAs in previous quarters, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. concentrates conversation peaks and ensures a certain virality on social media by choosing controversial and sensitive subjects, even bizarre ones (the worm). He also has creative ideas for dealing with the two major candidates, such as his own \u201creal debate\u201d during the Trump-Biden debate.\n\nRepublican Candidates\n\nWith 1.91M mentions in Q2, the volume of discussions on social media on Republican candidates increased slightly (2%) compared to Q1 2024.. Donald Trump alone has almost 93% of share of voice on social media, an increase of 20 points. In fact, it\u2019s Donald Trump\u2019s criminal cases that are doing most of the talking about the White House candidate in Q2 24:\n\n\u2013Trump\u2019s classified documents trial in Florida indefinitely postponed (May 8.)\n\n-Donald Trump became the first former U.S. president to face a criminal trial (Apr 15.)\n\n-Donald Trump has been convicted on all 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up a sex scandal that threatened his ascent to the White House in 2016 (May 30)\n\nIn July, mentions of Donald Trump increased by 202% with two events: His attempted assassination at the rally in Pennsylvania on 13 July and the RNC in Milwaukee from 15 to 18 July.\n\nFormer Republican Candidates\n\nTimelines\n\nAll the Republican candidates have withdrawn from the race against Donald Trump since Q1, but some continue to speak out or make news. In particular, contest for Trump vice president spotlighted former candidates on social media. Most support Trump, with the exception of former VP Mike Pence.\n\nNikki Haley says she will vote for rival Trump after staying silent for months (May 22)\n\nDoug Burgum\u2019s share of voice has risen sharply (118%): Like Tim Scott, he\u2019s seen as rising in the ranks to be Trump\u2019s VP.\n\nFormer vice president Mike Pence, is calling Trump\u2019s latest statement on his abortion policies \u201ca slap in the face to the millions of pro-life Americans who voted for him in 2016 and 2020 (Apr. 9)\n\nTim Scott is launching a multimillion dollar effort to recruit Black voters to support Republicans in 2024. (Jun. 6)\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis told donors he would help raise money for former presidential rival Donald Trump (April 10)\n\nIn July, during the RNC, 2 prominent primary challengers Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley urged the party to unite behind its official nominee Donald Trump.\n\nKey Political issues\n\nWhat are the key political issues being discussed about Presidential candidates Joe Biden and Donald Trump in Q2?\n\nWhat sets Trump vs. Biden apart:\n\nTrump\u2019s judicial affairs are very present in the top 15 through the topic \u201cTrump indictment \u201c . This is the biggest change from Q1. Trump\u2019s criminal hush money case has been much commented on and used by Democratic supporters.\n\nAnother difference is still with \u201cMedia Ethics\u201d in 7th position as in Q1. The data continues to show, as in Q1, the multiple attacks by Donald Trump\u2019s supporters on the media and the alleged misinformation about their candidate. On the other hand, the media are doing their fact-checking, pointing out the many false statements made by Trump, particularly during the June 27 debate.\n\nTax: this is a topic shared by the 2 candidates, now in the top 5, so it\u2019s a big step up from Q1, when it was mentioned less. Lowering taxes for Trump\u2019s rich friends was an attack by the Democrats that was widely taken up on social media.\n\nIsrael/Hamas, China, Ukraine, Foreign Affairs: all these topics are much more commented on in relation to Joe Biden\u2019s stances as a result of his actions as President (aid for Israel and Ukraine, taxation of Chinese products).\n\nAbortion rights are the other major difference between the two candidates: in 9th position for Joe Biden, who has made many speeches on the subject, but only in 17th position for Trump, who defers abortion decisions to the states.\n\nIn July, two news items in particular boosted the number of mentions about the White House candidates:\n\n1. Donald Trump\u2019s assassination attempt:\n\nAs soon as the shooting was announced at the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, social media mentions soared, reaching a 202% increase in 24 hours compared to the previous month, and a record 25 million mentions in 3 days worldwide.\n\nThe most published messages were divided into 4 topics:\n\nthe shooting and wounding of Donald Trump\n\nthe alleged errors and failings of the Secret Service\n\nthe identity of the shooter\n\nand countless misinformation and conspiracy theories: Online posts falsely claim sharpshooter was told not to fire on suspect in Trump shooting, Posts baselessly claim the shooting was staged to benefit Trump politically, False claims that the assassination attempt was ordered by President Biden or other members of the \u201cdeep state\u201d, Photos that misidentify the alleged shooter.\n\n2. The 4-day Republican National Convention in Milwaukee\n\nHere are the most talked-about facts about RNC on social media:\n\nDay 1:\n\n135K mentions: Donald Trump make his first public appearance since the assassination attempt sporting a bandage on his ear.\n\n87K: Trump becomes the official Republican presidential nominee\n\n283K: Trump chooses Sen. J.D. Vance, a former critic, as his vice-presidential running mate\n\nDay 2:\n\n60K: The second night focus on crime and immigration\n\nDonald Trump is feted by his former rivals :\n\n227K mentions: Nikki Haley calls for unity in speech endorsing Trump\n\n93K: Ron DeSantis delivers a cutting speech calling for former President Trump\u2019s reelection\n\nDay 3:\n\n232K: JD Vance delivers his first speech as VP pick: and introduced himself to a national audience\n\nDay 4:",

        "text": "What Georgia Tells Us About the 2024 Election Subversion Campaign\nThis was originally published by Slate.\n\nEven before the first vote in the 2024 election is cast, partisan extremists are jockeying for the opportunity to potentially subvert the outcome. Georgia is the eye of the storm. Last week, Georgia\u2019s Republican-controlled State Election Board voted to give county boards the unprecedented authority to second-guess election officials before certifying election results. This move\u2014which could pave the way for unwarranted delays and refusals to certify an adverse vote\u2014is part of a national effort to empower partisans to steal the election if they don\u2019t like the results. But make no mistake: While alarming and dangerous, none of this maneuvering will make legal what is not, including any plot to thwart an election.\n\nThe new Georgia regulation follows the failed scheme to overturn the 2020 election and is part of a larger election subversion campaign playing out across the country. In Georgia, Arizona, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas, and other key battleground states, lawmakers have passed laws inviting partisan interference in election administration or electoral outcomes. In these states and others, right-wing activists have sought to force unreliable hand counting of all ballots and contests even in large jurisdictions, a move that would introduce error into the process and dramatically slow down results. And election deniers are filing lawsuits across the country asking courts to greenlight attacks on certification, throw out votes, or change election procedures based on unsubstantiated conspiracy theories. All these actions seek to lay the groundwork to try to justify throwing out legitimate election results. While the effort this year is more widespread and better funded than the effort by Donald Trump and his allies to overturn his loss in the 2020 election, it is no more legal than the 2020 effort.\n\nBack in Georgia, the focus has now turned to election certification, an obscure but ceremonial step at the end of the election process to make the results official. Earlier this year, a member of the Fulton County Election Board refused to certify the primary election results unless she could review troves of election data. She even filed a lawsuit asking a court to grant her that power despite over a century of law and practice to the contrary, as we explain in our friend-of-the-court brief.\n\nThen the five-member State Election Board, controlled by three members who publicly questioned the 2020 election results, joined the fray. Egged on by Trump, who praised the three members in the majority by name at a rally in Georgia, the board has voted to turn certification into an opportunity for conspiracy theorists and partisans to block the will of the people.\n\nThe state board\u2019s rule, along with the Fulton County board member\u2019s stalling tactics, are wholly inappropriate. In Georgia, election boards aren\u2019t generally involved in election administration, and they do not weigh in on the count for a reason. A handful of political appointees are not and should not be empowered to take matters into their own hands to reject an election outcome. The role of boards is ministerial; they are there to certify elections, not to reinvestigate their details. The law in Georgia, and the law in every state, is clear: certification is a mandatory act. Any election disputes or contests are handled by the courts, which provide formal processes and are equipped to evaluate evidence and interpret the law.\n\nAny claim of authority by any state or local official to deny or overturn election results is unlawful. Despite the smokescreen, numerous federal and state laws prohibit officials from negating the will of the people to help elect their preferred candidates. The U.S. Constitution and all state constitutions protect voting rights and the due process of voters, and federal law makes it a crime to conspire to deprive individuals of their votes, among other protections. In the past few years, courts have ruled against officials in several battleground states trying to deny or delay certification and candidates trying to overturn results. In each instance, certification was eventually mandated because the law requires it. The certification charade in Georgia is nothing more than an attempt to put a veneer of legality over illegal conduct. We should not be duped.\n\nIf enough Americans buy the ruse that our election system allows for this kind of manipulation, then it will be easier for wrongdoers to get away with it. For this reason, the main advocacy target of this disinformation-fueled plot is the American people. To be sure, we must strengthen our legal safeguards so that it is harder to promote these scams in the future; passing the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, currently pending in Congress, is a critical step to prevent all sorts of shenanigans. But even without additional safeguards, our current institutions can and should repel election subversion plots if Americans remain vigilant.\n\nSupporters of free and fair elections can hold the line if we pay attention and demand adherence to the law\u2014taking it to the courts (who can order compliance with the law), to state election authorities (who typically oversee statewide counts and can help protect the system against rogue local actors), to governors (who typically certify presidential election victors), and ultimately to the American people (who are the final arbiters of the legitimacy of elections). Any plot to subvert election results would require failures to uphold the law on multiple levels.\n\nEven then, if the public sees these plots for what they really are, then they will not succeed. We must not give credence to the fallacy that it is possible to find legitimate loopholes to accepting the will of the voters.",

        "text": "New UH/TSU Survey Finds Trump\u2019s Lead Among Likely Texas Voters is Narrowing\n\u2800\n\nUH/TSU survey finds Trump leading Harris in Texas 49.5% - 44.6% UH/TSU survey finds Cruz leads Allred 46.6% - 44.5% in U.S. Senate race\n\nNearly half of Texans plan to vote for former Republican President Donald Trump in November, according to a new survey of likely voters, while 44.6% support the Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nWhile Trump has increased his vote share slightly in the past two months \u2013 49.5% now, compared to 48.9% in June \u2013 Harris has chipped away at his lead, shrinking the gap to just under 5 points. That\u2019s notably tighter than the nine-point lead Trump held over President Joe Biden in the earlier survey, part of a series conducted by the Hobby School of Public Affairs at the University of Houston and the Executive Master of Public Administration program in the Barbara Jordan \u2013 Mickey Leland School of Public Affairs at Texas Southern University.\n\n\u201cHarris has made considerable headway among voters both in Texas and nationally in the short time since she entered the race last month,\u201d said Ren\u00e9e Cross, researcher and senior executive director of the Hobby School. \u201cThat\u2019s particularly true among younger voters, with 55% of Gen Z voters saying they will support her, compared to just 39% who backed Biden, but she also has gained among women and independent voters.\u201d\n\nStill, Cross noted, Texas remains a red state, with Trump maintaining a strong lead among men, white voters and older voters.\n\nTrump holds a narrow lead over Harris, 47% to 46%, among Latino voters, a sharp contrast to 2020 when Texas Latinos backed Biden over Trump by a 17-point margin.\n\nThe survey also found the race for U.S. Senate between Republican incumbent Ted Cruz and Democrat Colin Allred remains tight, with Cruz leading 46.6% to 44.5%; 6.4% are undecided, and 2.5% support Libertarian Ted Brown.\n\nThis second-wave survey followed Biden\u2019s historic decision to drop out of the 2024 presidential race and Harris\u2019 nomination. A substantial number of respondents from the June survey were reinterviewed, along with the addition of new respondents to ensure a representative sample.\n\nMark P. Jones, political science fellow at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy and senior research fellow at the Hobby School, said Trump\u2019s continued dominance in the state obscures some changes revealed by the survey.\n\n\u201cWhat had been a stable race, with Trump leading Biden by a margin in the high single digits for months, has tightened,\u201d he said. \u201cSupport has declined for third-party candidates, especially Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who dropped to 2% in this survey from 5% in June, with more than twice as many of Kennedy\u2019s former supporters switching their votes to Harris than to Trump\u201d.\n\nJust 2.7% of likely Texas voters remain undecided in the presidential race.\n\nMichael Adams, director of the Executive Master of Public Administration graduate program at TSU, said Harris\u2019 gains among Independent voters account for much of her increased support over Biden, with most of that coming from people who previously backed Kennedy or Stein.\n\n\u201cIndependent voters in Texas are fairly evenly split between Trump and Harris, at 41% vs. 39%,\u201d Adams said. \u201cIn June, with Biden still in the race, we found that 42% of Independents favored Trump, while just 18% supported Biden. It appears that a substantial portion of the third-party vote in part reflected a desire for another candidate, and Harris has provided that.\u201d\n\nEight percent of Independent voters now back Kennedy, while 5% favor Stein or Oliver; that compares to June, when 14% of Independents supported Kennedy and 10% backed Stein or Oliver.\n\nAmong the survey\u2019s other findings:\n\nHarris is drawing women voters away from Trump. She holds a six-point lead among women, 50% to 44%. In June, Trump held a four-point lead over Biden among women, 46% to 42%. (Trump holds an 18-point lead over Harris among men, 56% to 38%.)\n\nThe race appears stable: 96% of Harris voters and 92% of Trump voters say they are certain about their vote choice, with only 4% and 8% respectively saying they might change their minds before the November election.\n\nBlack voters favor Allred over Cruz, 72% to 20%, while Latinos support Allred over Cruz by a smaller margin, 46% to 40%. White voters favor Cruz, 57% to 40%.\n\nAllred holds a seven-point lead over Cruz among women, 49% to 42%, while Cruz holds a 13-point lead among men, 52% to 39%.\n\nHarris\u2019 net favorability rating has improved considerably since June. Currently 48% of Texas likely voters say they have a favorable opinion of her, while 51% have an unfavorable opinion, for a net favorability rating of -3%. That\u2019s down from -14% in June.\n\n49% of likely voters have a favorable opinion of Trump, while 50% have an unfavorable opinion, for a net favorability rating of -1%.\n\nThe survey was conducted between Aug. 5-16 in English and Spanish. The margin of error is +/-2.65%.",

        "text": "'There'll be a revolution': Deep divisions ahead of 2024 presidential election\nIn Woodstock, Illinois, they know all about the cycle of repetition.\n\nThe small town, around an hour's drive from Chicago, where this week's Democratic National Convention is being held, is actually where the movie Groundhog Day was filmed.\n\nIts part in movie history is marked by a huge mural on the main street, a poster of the film's star Bill Murray in the estate agent window and a plaque at the bed and breakfast which featured as one of the sets.\n\nBut in a place where a narrative of monotony is celebrated, the story now is about the upcoming presidential election and a new offer that goes beyond re-electing an incumbent. But for many here, Kamala Harris is an elusive candidate.\n\n\"It's tough to make a decision on something where you were thinking one way and now you have to switch your gears because it's a whole new person,\" says Matt Drennan, who owns a shop on the main square selling model trains.\n\n\"I want to hear what she's going to do, what's going to be different than what's already been done.\"\n\nUsually, by the time a national convention arrives, there is a clear sense of the policy platforms of the nominee.\n\nImage: Woodstock was the location for the film Groundhog Day\n\nWhen Hillary Clinton ran for president in 2016, she had more than 200 distinct policy proposals. Four years ago, Joe Biden had a 110-page policy document for his White House bid.\n\nNow, Vice President Kamala Harris doesn't even have a policy page on her campaign website, perhaps owing to her late entry into the race. Her campaign seems to be propelled at the moment by good vibes and the overall energy she brings.\n\n\"I mean, honestly, she just got into the race,\" says Matt. \"She was the vice president and if you look at the history - other than Al Gore - most of the vice presidents nobody knows much about.\n\n\"The big problem is you don't totally know her policies yet,\" he adds, \"so I'm reading up on that to see what works, to see who is the best candidate for small business and the economy.\n\n\"I'm doing my research and my due diligence now. A lot of people take that instant 60-second sound bite and decide their lives on it.\"\n\nSpreaker Spreaker , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

It's a community shaped by the railroads and home to the United States' largest railway museum.\n\nLinda is visiting with her grandsons. She believes the momentum in the 2024 race is now firmly with Harris.\n\n\"She's smart and I believe she's going to win,\" Linda says. \"I'm very excited about this. She just has that energy and that enthusiasm. I liked Joe Biden, but there's a difference from being 80 to 60, there just is.\"\n\nIn the nearby village of Island Lake, they're celebrating the annual corn fest.

But as quickly as he is crowned champion, I see the deep divisions in this community - and mirrored across the US - exposed.\n\nI ask a local man, Jim Conour, what he makes of Kamala Harris. \"She's not a good candidate at all,\" he says. \"She's, frankly, dumb as a stump. She's not very bright, you see her do her word salads and she just can't articulate a thought.\"\n\nI ask who he thinks will be in the White House in January.\n\n\"I truly believe Trump will be there,\" he says. \"If it's not, we're going to be in trouble.

There's more gun owners than enlisted servicemen, and they are not going to go against patriots.\"\n\n\"I don't care what colour camouflage comes after me,\" he adds, \"this is the holy war in the United States.

        "text": "Fake celebrity endorsements become latest weapon in misinformation wars, sowing confusion ahead of 2024 election\nWashington CNN \u2014\n\nTaylor Swift didn\u2019t endorse former President Donald Trump last weekend. Ryan Reynolds wasn\u2019t photographed wearing a pro-Kamala Harris shirt. And the Communist Party USA never backed President Joe Biden\u2019s now-defunct campaign.\n\nBut these false claims about the 2024 campaign, and dozens of other posts with similar fake endorsements, have exploded on social media in the run up to the election, according to researchers at the News Literacy Project, a nonpartisan education group that launched a new database Thursday chronicling more than 550 unique instances of election-related misinformation.\n\nThe latest and most visible example these bogus claims emerged Sunday, when Trump shared a post on his Truth Social platform containing images created with the use of artificial intelligence that suggested a groundswell of support from Swift fans calling themselves \u201cSwifties for Trump.\u201d In response to the implied endorsement from the pop icon, Trump wrote, \u201cI accept!\u201d\n\nSwift, who previously assailed Trump as \u201cstoking the fires of white supremacy and racism\u201d during his presidency, endorsed Joe Biden in 2020 but has not yet backed a presidential candidate in the 2024 race.\n\nWhile one image in the collage posted by Trump, showing Swift in an \u201cUncle Sam\u201d outfit, was obviously doctored, another showing a young woman at a rally appeared to be authentic.\n\nThe other images purporting to show large groups of smiling fans celebrating Trump contained some of the hallmarks of AI-generated images, according to Lucas Hansen, co-founder of CivAI, a nonprofit that raises awareness about the growing capabilities and dangers of AI.\n\nThose images appeared \u201csuper airbrushed, have high-camera quality\u201d and \u201ceveryone is really good-looking,\u201d Hansen said. The images make use of \u201cheavy bokeh and background blurring,\u201d common traits of AI-generated images, he said.\n\nThe News Literacy Project says it launched its misinformation dashboard Thursday to raise awareness of viral falsehoods that it believes poses an \u201cexistential threat to democracy\u201d and are best examined through bulk analysis of hundreds of examples, instead of individual fact-checks.\n\nThe database, which will be regularly updated, tracks several categories of political disinformation \u2013 conspiracy theories, lies about candidates\u2019 policy views and fake endorsements \u2013 but the group isn\u2019t measuring how many times these viral posts are shared.\n\nRoughly 1 in 10 viral posts analyzed by the News Literacy Project contained fake endorsements, according to data provided exclusively to CNN. Those posts described supposed endorsements \u2014 or alternatively, public snubs \u2014 from celebrities including NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers, actor Morgan Freeman, musician Bruce Springsteen, and political figures like former First Lady Michelle Obama.\n\nThe posts invoking these four figures racked up at least 10 million views, the database showed.\n\nAt times, researchers found separate posts circulating on social media simultaneously claiming the same celebrity had endorsed and denounced a candidate, underscoring the chaotic and misleading environment users are encountering.\n\n\u201cAs a general rule, if you see a celebrity wearing a T-shirt with an explicitly political message, there\u2019s a good chance it\u2019s fake,\u201d said Dan Evon, a senior manager at the News Literacy Project.\n\nGuardrails come down\n\nThe fake endorsements proliferating on social media come as technology platforms dismantle guardrails and moderation policies designed to reduce the spread of dangerous misinformation.\n\nThese changes have been most acute on X, formerly known as Twitter, after billionaire Elon Musk purchased the company and gutted in-house teams that worked to stop the spread of election disinformation, and restored the banned accounts of prominent conspiracy theorists and extremists.\n\nExperts say the problem has been exacerbated by X\u2019s AI-powered chatbot, Grok, which has already drawn the ire of election officials for spreading false information about Harris\u2019 eligibility in the 2024 election. Last week, X began allowing users to use Grok to create AI-generated images from text prompts, unleashing a flood of fake content about Trump and Harris.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, Grok is likely to be one of the main sources of these sorts of images because it generates high-quality images, is easily available, and was intentionally made to have a low refusal rate,\u201d Hansen said, adding that he was able to use Grok to create images of \u201cSwifties for Trump\u201d that closely resemble the ones Trump shared.\n\nX did not respond to requests for comment on the creation of misleading images involving political candidates.\n\nMeta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, has also cut some staff from its election integrity teams, CNN previously reported. The social media giant said last year that \u201cno tech company does more or invests more to protect elections,\u201d and announced that it would require political advertisers to disclose if they used AI to create or alter any images.\n\nBut even as some online platforms scramble to label AI-generated images, and fact-checkers debunk the latest viral lies, the deluge of made-up material can have an impact.\n\n\u201cIf you repeatedly see these falsehoods that exaggerate a candidate\u2019s popularity, it can still stick, even if you know it\u2019s not legitimate as you scroll past it in your feed,\u201d Peter Adams, the News Literacy Project\u2019s senior vice president for research, told CNN.\n\nWhile the release of publicly available AI tools has made it easier to create misleading claims, including many of the fake endorsements identified by the News Literacy Project, other bogus images circulating on social media made use of rudimentary photoshopping.\n\nThe use of AI to concoct political disinformation has been \u201cnot quite as prevalent and pernicious as people had initially feared,\u201d Adams said, adding that traditional methods of doctoring images and videos remain, for now, \u201cmuch cheaper but just as effective.\u201d",

        "text": "How will the upcoming US Presidential election impact climate change?\nThe choice of Tim Walz as the Democratic Party candidate for Vice President in the United States elections later this year is being strongly welcomed by the climate change community. His presence in a future administration, should Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris win the White House, is expected to ensure that the US remains committed to its climate pledges and possibly even strengthen them further. That is because of Walz\u2019s past track record of climate action as Governor of Minnesota.\n\nThe climate community has no love lost for Donald Trump, who pulled the US out of the Paris Agreement as soon as he took over as President in 2016.\n\nThe prospect of Trump winning a second term is seen as a threat to the minor gains made by the US on the climate front during Joe Biden\u2019s presidency. Trump\u2019s recent remarks on climate change during a conversation with billionaire Elon Musk on social media were a further reminder that his views have not undergone any change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut while Trump gets most of the blame for the lack of adequate climate action on the part of the US, the fact is that previous administrations haven\u2019t been very impressive either. The lacklustre performance of the US on climate action over the last three decades is not because of any lack of ability or resources but a result of a calculated strategy.\n\nTim Walz\u2019s record on climate change\n\nAs a two-time Governor of Minnesota, Walz\u2019s biggest claim to fame is a legislation that he signed on last year requiring Minnesota to generate all its electricity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2040, according to reports in the American news media. This law was enacted during a legislative session in which nearly 40 other climate initiatives were pushed through. These included tax rebates on electric vehicles and plans to expand the network of charging stations, The New York Times reported.\n\nIf the Democratic Party wins the presidential election, Governor Walz will bring to Washington DC the most substantive climate record of any incoming President or Vice President since Vice President Al Gore, who served two terms with President Bill Clinton from 1993 to 2001, The NYT report said.\n\nAnnual CO2 emissions by the US. Annual CO2 emissions by the US.\n\nWalz probably has even better credentials than Gore since he has already been successful in making policy changes, according to the report. Gore incidentally won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for his climate activism \u2014 and shared that prize with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the United Nations body that advances scientific knowledge about climate change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe laws and policies introduced by Walz in Minnesota were those that the Democrats would like to replicate nationally, according to a report by The Scientific American.\n\nHowever, Walz is not unique in having pushed some climate-friendly legislation at the state level. Several other states in the US, most of them with Democratic Governors, have introduced similar policies. For example, New York has committed itself to 100 per cent clean energy by 2040, just like Minnesota, and so has Oregon. Several states have incentivised renewable energy and electric vehicles, and set targets for emission reductions.\n\nBut the focus on Walz\u2019s climate record is a good political strategy to score a point over Trump who has remained unapologetic in trivialising the climate crisis.\n\nMajor changes unlikely\n\nIt is extremely unlikely, however, that the Harris-Walz team, if it comes to power, would bring any drastic change in US climate policy, and go beyond the roadmap finalised by the Biden administration through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe trajectory that the US has taken on climate change in the last three decades has largely been a result of bipartisan agreement, with the exception of Trump. And even Trump is unlikely to be as disruptive this time. He has never spoken about withdrawing from the Paris Agreement once again after his previous act of 2016 was undone by Biden.\n\nHowever, it is quite possible that climate action would not figure on Trump\u2019s list of priorities. An analysis by Carbon Brief, a UK-based climate-focused publication, earlier this year said Trump\u2019s presidency could result in an additional 4 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent being emitted into the atmosphere by 2030.\n\nBut to expect that the choice of Walz by the Harris team would energise global climate action would be unrealistic. The US has never been ambitious on climate action, and there is no reason why this would change if Walz becomes Vice President next year.\n\nIn fact, the failure of the US to act responsibly on climate change has been the major reason why it has become all but impossible to achieve the 1.5 degree Celsius temperature target. The US did not just walk out of the Paris Agreement, it had not joined the previous Kyoto Protocol either.\n\nIts emissions are almost the same level as that in 1990, the benchmark year to measure emissions reductions for developed countries. The US has instead chosen 2005 as the baseline year to show progress. Its current emissions are about 17% less than the 2005 levels, but between 1990 and 2005, its emissions had increased by about 15%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe IRA is considered a major breakthrough, but it still commits the US to only a 50-52% reduction in emissions by 2030 on the 2005 baseline. This translates to a 46% reduction on 2019 levels.\n\nThe most recent IPCC assessments show that the world as a whole needs to cut at least 43% of global emissions by 2030 if hopes of meeting the 1.5 degree Celsius target are to be kept alive. That means the US, if it meets its own emissions reduction target for 2030, would be doing only what is expected of the world as a whole, and not more as is required of the country that has the largest historical responsibility.\n\nAnd even this might not be achieved. An analysis by Rhodium Group, a research firm based in the US, last month showed that the US was not on track to achieve its 2030 targets. It said at the current rate, the US would be able to manage only about 32% to 43% reductions in its emissions by 2030. The 52% target could be achieved only by 2035.",

(Wolfgang Schaller via Shutterstock)\n\nA divided Supreme Court on Thursday afternoon granted a request from the Republican National Committee and the Republican leaders of Arizona\u2019s legislature to reinstate a state law that requires residents to provide proof of citizenship to register to vote using a form provided by the state. The court turned down a request, however, to reinstate the portion of the same law that would bar voters who register using a standard federal form from voting for president or by mail unless they provide proof of citizenship.\n\nThe vote was 5-4. In a brief unsigned order, three of the court\u2019s conservative justices \u2013 Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch \u2013 indicated that they would have granted the RNC\u2019s application to fully reinstate the law.\n\nFour other justices \u2013 Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Amy Coney Barrett, and Ketanji Brown Jackson \u2013 indicated that they would have denied the RNC\u2019s request in its entirety, keeping in place a ruling by a federal district court in Arizona blocking the state from enforcing the law.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh did not publicly signal how they voted, but they must have provided the two remaining votes necessary to revive the portion of the law dealing with the state form.\n\nThe RNC and the legislative officials had asked the justices to act by Aug. 22, to give the state enough time to print ballots before the election.\n\nThe National Voter Registration Act of 1993 requires states to \u201caccept and use\u201d a standard form to register voters for federal elections. That federal form requires would-be voters to swear, under penalty of perjury, that they are U.S. citizens, but they are not required to provide proof of citizenship.\n\nThe Arizona law at the center of the dispute is known as H.B. 2492. Enacted in 2022, it directs county officials to attempt to verify the U.S. citizenship of anyone who attempts to register using the federal form. If the officials cannot do so \u2013 for example, because they do not have access to databases that would provide information about citizenship \u2013 the applicant must submit proof of citizenship (such as a passport or birth certificate) to vote for president or by mail. In a separate provision, the law also requires anyone who registers using Arizona\u2019s state form to submit proof of citizenship.\n\nSoon after the law was enacted, the federal government and a group of private plaintiffs, including voting-rights groups and Democrats, went to federal court in Arizona to challenge H.B. 2492. They argued that the NVRA supersedes Arizona\u2019s requirement to submit proof of citizenship to vote for president or by mail.\n\nThe private plaintiffs also contended that a 2018 consent decree barred the state from enforcing the requirement to provide proof of citizenship to register using state forms.\n\nLast year a federal district court in Arizona agreed with the United States and the private plaintiffs that the NVRA trumps the federal-form provisions, and that the consent decree barred Arizona from enforcing the state-form provision. In a final order entered in May of this year, the district court prohibited the state from enforcing any of the provisions.\n\nThe Republican National Committee and Republican leaders of the state senate and house joined the case to defend the law. On July 18, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit granted their request to put the portion of the district court\u2019s order dealing with the consent decree and the state-form provision on hold. But the court of appeals left in place the part of the order holding that the NVRA supersedes the federal-form provisions.\n\nOn Aug. 1, a different three-judge panel reinstated the district court\u2019s order, prompting the RNC and legislative leaders to come to the Supreme Court on Aug. 8, asking the justices to put the district court\u2019s order on hold \u201cto the extent it requires Arizona to (1) accept state-form voter registration applications lacking documentary proof of citizenship and (2) allow voters who have not provided documentary proof of citizenship to cast ballots for president or by mail.\u201d\n\nPointing to what it characterized as the 9th Circuit\u2019s \u201cdisruptive displacement of election rules enacted by the Arizona Legislature in 2022,\u201d the RNC contended that the Purcell principle \u2013 the idea that courts should not change election rules during the period of time just prior to an election \u2013 warranted the Supreme Court\u2019s intervention.\n\nThe RNC also criticized the district court\u2019s order as an \u201cunqualified abrogation of the Arizona legislature\u2019s sovereign authority to determine the qualifications of voters and structure participation in its elections.\u201d\n\nFirst, it contended, by pointing to the 2018 consent decree as a reason to prohibit the state from enforcing the proof-of-citizenship requirement for its own voter registration forms, the court of appeals \u201cignored the established rule that a consent decree generally yields to a change in the law, including a change in statutory law.\u201d The 9th Circuit\u2019s reasoning, the RNC suggested, \u201cpresents significant separation-of-powers concerns\u201d because it \u201cwould mean that a judgment entered unilaterally by an executive branch officer indefinitely displaced the Legislature\u2019s power.\u201d\n\nSecond, the RNC continued, requiring proof of citizenship for voters who want to register using the federal form and then vote by mail provision protects against fraud. But the district court\u2019s ruling \u201cexpands a statute focused on voter registration to require Arizona to expand mail-in voting,\u201d the RNC complained. And the NVRA does not preempt state law with regard to voting for president, the RNC added, because the Constitution only gives Congress limited power over the selection of presidential electors. \u201cThat authority does not permit Congress to displace state rules for registering to vote in presidential elections.\u201d\n\nRepresented by U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, the Biden administration had urged the justices to turn down the RNC\u2019s request \u201cto the extent it seeks a stay of the portion of the injunction based on the United States\u2019 NVRA claim.\u201d The RNC\u2019s \u201ccursory discussion of the relevant issues provides no sound basis for a stay,\u201d Prelogar insisted, particularly when it is seeking relief based on the premise that a federal law is unconstitutional.\n\nMore specifically, Prelogar continued, the Supreme Court in 2013 ruled \u2013 in a case involving Arizona \u2013 that states violate the NVRA if they reject a federal form based on the voter\u2019s failure to provide proof of citizenship. States cannot require a voter to provide any additional information beyond what the federal form requires, she wrote. The NVRA therefore supersedes \u201cArizona\u2019s requirement that voters who register with the federal form submit documentary proof in order to vote for President or vote by mail.\u201d\n\nArizona, represented by Attorney General Kris Mayes, opposed the RNC\u2019s request. Mayes acknowledged the state\u2019s interest in defending and enforcing the law, but she countered that the \u201cState also has an interest in smoothly administering its laws, especially for elections.\u201d Indeed, she wrote, \u201cputting the district court\u2019s injunction on hold now\u201d would be \u201cdestabilizing,\u201d because the state has not been enforcing the provisions at the center of the dispute.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee and the Arizona Democratic Party echoed this sentiment in their brief, observing that the relief sought by RNC and Republican legislators would also \u201cmean people who voted for a presidential candidate or by mail earlier this year \u2014 including in the July 30 primary just two weeks ago \u2014 would suddenly be unable to do so.\u201d\n\nThis article was originally published at Howe on the Court.",

        "text": "South Koreans keep eye on US election amid North Korea's evolving threats\nSouth Koreans are keeping a close eye on the upcoming U.S. presidential election, scrambling to determine the implications its outcome would have for the security of their country.\n\nA recent poll by South Korea's Institute of National Unification showed that about 66% of respondents supported the country having its own nuclear weapons. This has spurred heated debate among the South Korean public.\n\nEarlier this month, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un oversaw the delivery of 250 new tactical ballistic missile launchers to frontline troops, according to the country's official Korean Central News Agency.\n\nThe missile launchers appear to be transporter erector launcher vehicles for a type of short-range ballistic missile that North Korea claimed could be fitted with nuclear warheads. If confirmed, analysts say, the deployment would overwhelm South Korea's missile defenses.\n\nGrowing concern\n\n\"In order to cope with the threat from the North, South Korea needs to be nuclear-armed,\" Kim Tae-woo, head researcher of nuclear security at the Korea Institute for Military Affairs (KIMA), told VOA Korean on Tuesday. \"There is no other way to guarantee the survival of the country.\"\n\nCheong Seong-chang, director of the Department of Reunification Strategy Studies at the Seoul-based Sejong Institute, said the North Korean threat is too close to home for South Koreans.\n\n\"There is no other country in the world that makes frequent nuclear threats against a neighboring country in the way North Korea does against South Korea,\" Cheong told VOA Korean on Wednesday.\n\nKim of the KIMA said that a strengthening of the U.S. nuclear deterrent through the bilateral Nuclear Consultative Group (NCG) would not be sufficient to protect South Korea against a North Korean nuclear attack.\n\n\"First, it won't be able to keep up with North Korea's nuclear threat in terms of the pace and the extent of evolution and growth,\" Kim said. \"Second, there is a growing risk that political changes in South Korea and the United States may halt the arrangement or make it less binding.\"\n\nExtended deterrence\n\nIn April 2023, U.S. President Joe Biden and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol adopted the Washington Declaration, which outlines a series of measures, including the establishment of the NCG, to deter North Korea's nuclear weapons use. At its core, the declaration expanded Washington's promise to defend South Korea with nuclear weapons if necessary \u2014 a policy known as \"extended deterrence.\"\n\nThe Biden administration appears firmly opposed to South Korea building its own nuclear weapons.\n\n\"We believe that the only effective way to reduce nuclear threats on the peninsula is by curbing the proliferation of nuclear weapons,\" a State Department spokesperson said in an emailed statement on July 10 in response to a VOA Korean inquiry.\n\n\"President Yoon has reaffirmed the ROK's long-standing commitment to its obligations under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as the cornerstone of the global nonproliferation regime,\" the email continued.\n\nROK stands for Republic of Korea, the official name of South Korea.\n\n\"The Yoon administration has made clear that it is not pursuing a nuclear weapons program and that it is working closely with the United States through existing extended deterrence mechanisms,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nVipin Narang, who recently served as the U.S. acting assistant secretary of defense for space policy, said that the NCG would play an important role in strengthening the U.S.-South Korea extended nuclear deterrence relationship.\n\n\"We have signed a guidelines document charting a path ahead, begun work to facilitate integration across the alliance, and now stand as equal partners strengthening deterrence against nuclear and other forms of strategic attack from North Korea,\" Narang said August 1 in a seminar at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).\n\nNarang added that the United States \"may reach a point where a change in the size or posture of our current deployed forces is necessary\" if there is no change in the nuclear trajectories of North Korea.\n\nIn an interview with VOA Korean in July, Narang emphasized that the NCG would \"evolve in accordance with the threats faced by the U.S.-South Korea alliance.\"\n\nSeoul's nuclear desire\n\nSome experts say the possible reelection in November of former U.S. President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, could reshape Washington's alliance with Seoul and open the possibility of South Korea having its own nuclear weapons.\n\nJohn Bolton, former White House national security adviser during the Trump administration, told VOA Korean in an August 16 interview that \"Trump doesn't understand collective defense alliances.\"\n\n\"He looks at alliances as America defending South Korea and not getting paid for it,\" said Bolton, who also served as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations from 2005 to 2006.\n\n\"He didn't, in his first four years, grasp what the meaning of the alliance, the benefits it had for the United States as well as for South Korea,\" he said. \"I don't think he's learned in the four years he's been out of the office either.\"\n\nCheong of the Sejong Institute said, \"President Trump had previously held that South Korea and Japan should now be nuclear armed rather than relying on foreign countries to respond to the threat of North Korea and China.\"\n\nSeparate from Seoul's desire for its own nuclear weapons, Trump might consider redeploying U.S. tactical nuclear weapons in South Korea, said Robert Peters, research fellow for nuclear deterrence and missile defense at the Heritage Foundation.\n\n\"I think it is possible that a Trump administration could see the current environment as one where they would return American nuclear weapons to the Korean Peninsula, to be stored in nuclear weapons vaults on joint U.S.-ROK bases,\" Peters told VOA Korean via email on Wednesday.\n\nIn 1991, the U.S. withdrew all its nuclear weapons from South Korea. The weapons had been stationed there since the late 1950s.\n\nVictor Cha, senior vice president for Asia and Korea chair at CSIS, told VOA Korean on Wednesday via email that it was too early to determine what position Trump would take on South Korea's nuclear armament.\n\n\"I think it's way too premature to talk about whether Trump would support or oppose a nuclear South Korea,\" said Cha, who was the U.S. National Security Council's director for Asian affairs in the George W. Bush White House.\n\n\"The nonproliferation community, both Democrats and Republicans, would be strongly against adding more nuclear weapons states in either a Harris or Trump administration,\" said Cha.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, is widely expected to inherit Biden's Asia policies should she win the election.\n\nVOA Korean contacted both the Trump campaign and the Harris campaign and asked each whether its candidate would allow South Korea to have its own nuclear weapons, but did not receive a reply from either side.\n\nKim Hyungjin contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Among America\u2019s \u201cLow-Information Voters\u201d\nMonica Sheppard lives in Rome, Georgia, where she runs a bee-themed arts-and-crafts shop. Rome is a right-leaning town in the rural, poor, and intensely conservative northwest corner of the state. Education rates are low, and mainstream news does not easily take root. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who became the district\u2019s congresswoman in 2021, was elected in part because, for many voters, identifying with the QAnon conspiracy theory, as she\u2019d recently done, was less troubling than identifying with the Times. Sheppard, who is fifty-seven, is an occasional Times reader, but she has plenty of friends in the area who do not share her news-reading habits or her mostly liberal views. And, despite what Sheppard calls the \u201cbrick-wall-head-beating of it all,\u201d she often engages with them over political issues online. \u201cI guess I\u2019m just fascinated by how people think,\u201d she told me.\n\nRecently, Sheppard showed me one of many Facebook posts that have concerned her. A friend named Scott had shared a meme from a Facebook page called The Absolute Truth, which takes scattershot aim at science, liberals, the media, Bill Gates, Stephen Hawking, and the TV show \u201cThe View,\u201d among other things. Its ethos is neatly outlined in one of its posts: \u201cYou get used to it, I don\u2019t even see the news anymore. All I see is false flag, psyop, bullshit.\u201d The meme that he posted showed an image of a Chili\u2019s storefront. \u201cAnother major American franchise bites the dust,\u201d it read. Scott added in his post, \u201cI saw on U tube that 10 other big chain restaurants are on the endangered list including Fudruckers, Krystal, Red lobster, and others you know!\u201d Some commenters noted other \u201cmajor American\u201d restaurant chains on the brink of collapse, and others made mocking reference to Joe Biden\u2019s economic policy (\u201cBuild back better you know\u201d), which they seemed to hold responsible for the closings. Still other commenters pointed ominously to larger forces at play. \u201cA BIG reset is coming,\u201d one woman wrote.\n\nAfter stumbling across this discussion on Scott\u2019s Facebook page, Sheppard told me, \u201cI did a quick Google search and found multiple articles about these viral memes about restaurants closing that are not true.\u201d Beneath Scott\u2019s post, Sheppard wrote, \u201cThis actually isn\u2019t true.\u201d Scott responded gracefully, by the standards of the medium, but without quite giving in. \u201cI do hope you are right but business closing and layoffs are appearing more each day for some apparent reason?\u201d he wrote. A woman named Deena added, \u201cShow us how it isn\u2019t true?\u201d Sheppard replied, \u201cAll I had to do is search \u2018Chili\u2019s closing all stores\u2019 and found many news stories about it not being true and about a rash of viral memes like this one . . . none of which are true.\u201d She went on, \u201cIt is always wise to research a meme before taking it as fact!\u201d Arguing ensued about how many stores Chili\u2019s was closing\u2014fewer than twenty, it turned out, out of more than fifteen hundred\u2014and what this meant. Many suggested that the meme was pointing to deeper truths: the economy was bad, Biden was responsible for it, and anyone saying otherwise was not to be trusted. \u201cWe also know that the media lies,\u201d Deena said.\n\nA commenter named Heather questioned Sheppard\u2019s methodology. \u201cAnd you believe google?\u201d she wrote. Sheppard decided to log off. \u201cI found it scary that she would trust a meme that her friend posted on Facebook, but would not trust Google providing multiple sources from which to choose for more reliable information,\u201d Sheppard told me. She noted that this was not her first encounter with poorly informed Georgians. A family member, she said, gets some of her news from televangelists.\n\nI reached out to Scott, who works in private equity. He stuck by his guns. \u201cI love Monica,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut I think Monica goes directly to sources of information.\u201d This, he suggested, was not the right approach. \u201cUse common sense,\u201d he went on. \u201cFood is much higher now. There\u2019s so many things against restaurants right now.\u201d The Biden-Harris Administration was at fault, he concluded. \u201cThey created this.\u201d He mentioned a right-wing YouTube channel called Liberal Hivemind, where he gets some political news. The only other person from the Facebook thread whom I reached was Heather, a real-estate agent. She was friendly on the phone, and we spoke as she prepared for a cookout she had planned that evening. She told me that she is \u201cvery, very conservative,\u201d and, like Scott, would be voting for Donald Trump, but that she doesn\u2019t consume a lot of news beyond what she gleans from the right-wing TV network Newsmax. She also engages in political discussions on Facebook, adding, \u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t.\u201d She went on, \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to even watch the news, because it kind of nauseates me.\u201d\n\nA few weeks later, Sheppard alerted me to another Facebook conversation. This time, someone had posted a chart that compared the Biden and Trump Administrations using metrics like inflation rates, average hourly earnings, and the costs of gas, groceries, and electricity. The chart made a compelling case for Trump. But there was a problem: a label added by the platform\u2019s fact checkers noted that it included \u201cpartly false information.\u201d Sheppard pointed that out in a comment. A man named Danny responded, \u201cWhole Lotta stuff be labeled \u2018not true\u2019 on Facebook. Almost like Facebook has its own agenda.\u201d Sheppard asked him what news sources he trusted. \u201cI don\u2019t trust any media . . . nor google . . . nor Facebook,\u201d he said. \u201cI trust what I see.\u201d Sheppard later told me, \u201cI don\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. I\u2019d be electing my cat if I only relied on the behavior that I see!\u201d\n\nIn April, NBC News released the results of a poll that looked at how a thousand respondents consumed political news, and how they planned to vote. At the time, Biden was the overwhelming favorite among people who read newspapers, watched network news, and followed online news sites. Trump, meanwhile, led among those who frequently got their information from social media, cable news, and YouTube. The poll also showed that Trump most dominated among a subset of people described as \u201clow-information voters.\u201d Definitions of this group vary among experts, some of whom begin by pointing to the ubiquity of ignorance. \u201cIf you know what the F.T.C. did last week, you\u2019re a freak,\u201d David Schleicher, a professor at Yale Law School, told me. There were gaps in basic political knowledge even among law professors he knew. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of degree,\u201d he said. Nonetheless, he continued, low-information voters tend to have \u201cfewer observations about politics with which to make vote choices.\u201d\n\nJoshua Kalla, a professor of political science at Yale, notes that being low-information is not necessarily a problem. A better question is whether voters know about the specific things that matter to them. \u201cYou may think, incorrectly, that the 2020 election was stolen\u2014but, if you know which party will cut your taxes and that\u2019s all you care about, then does it matter?\u201d Kalla asked. \u201cThe important thing is that you\u2019re informed on issues you care about.\u201d Of course, finding good information is increasingly difficult. Decades ago, there were just a few channels on television; the Internet has broadened the choices and lowered the standards. \u201cNow people might seek out information about a particular candidate on a particular policy and think they have genuine info, but they\u2019re being misinformed or misled,\u201d Kalla said. The decline of newspapers has led to a decrease in split-ticket voting: voters know less about the candidates in their districts, so they simply vote along party lines. This has helped to nationalize politics. Cable news, which voters increasingly rely on, \u201ccarries a lot less information than the New York Times,\u201d Schleicher said.\n\nRichard Fording, a professor of political science at the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa, who has written about low-information voters, told me that they \u201cgenerally just vote in Presidential-election years\u2014if they vote at all.\u201d These voters seem to have once been spread pretty evenly between the political parties. Low-information voters who turned out for Bill Clinton in 1992 may have known little more than that he played the saxophone; some George W. Bush voters may have simply associated the former governor of Texas with the South. Partisan pundits have long blamed the successes of candidates they oppose on such voters. In 2012, the late right-wing radio host Rush Limbaugh pointed to them to explain Barack Obama\u2019s popularity. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna have to redefine low-information voter,\u201d Limbaugh said. \u201cThey\u2019re not just people watching TMZ. In fact, I would venture to say that over half of the average, ordinary Democrats voting for Obama have no clue what they\u2019re really doing.\u201d\n\nBy 2016, Fording told me, low-information voters appeared to be moving to the right. (His analysis specifically examined white low-information voters, whom he defined as those unable to correctly answer two of the three following questions: how long is a U.S. senator\u2019s term, which party currently controls the House, and which party controls the Senate.) \u201cTrump\u2019s whole playbook was to attract these people,\u201d Fording stated. Low-information voters, he found, are more likely to embrace stereotypes of other groups, and less likely to fact-check claims made by politicians. \u201cTrump was kind of the perfect candidate for them,\u201d he said. After the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape leaked, and voters largely stuck with Trump, Fording dug deeper into the low-information category. He came across a metric in psychology called the \u201cneed for cognition\u201d scale. \u201cA question that really caught my attention on the scale is an agree or disagree: \u2018Thinking is not my idea of fun,\u2019 \u201d Fording recalled. He and a colleague ran a study to see whether agreement with the statement correlated with support for Trump. It did.\n\nFording admits that the concept \u201csounds very condescending.\u201d But, he told me, \u201cit\u2019s been extensively studied for decades: people vary in terms of the enjoyment they get out of searching for new information.\u201d It\u2019s not a measure of intelligence, and, though it correlates with education level, it\u2019s not the same thing: some low-information voters have college degrees. Whatever their education, low-need-for-cognition voters are less likely to seek out alternative views, and more likely to trust people they respect. In November of 2016, as Fording had anticipated, they showed up in significantly larger numbers for Donald Trump than for Hillary Clinton. Given that they are not highly mobilized voters, Fording said, \u201cit was kind of an impressive feat Trump pulled off.\u201d\n\nAmericans have been believing bad information since long before birtherism, or the idea that the 2020 election was stolen. How many people, Schleicher asked me, believe conspiracy theories about the assassination of J.F.K.? \u201cMore than you\u2019d think,\u201d he said. But, he cautioned, \u201cthis does not mean people are stupid.\u201d He brought up Joseph Schumpeter, the famous Austrian economist and political scientist from the nineteen-thirties, who found that many people demonstrate a high degree of intelligence in their day-to-day business affairs, but suddenly sound like fools when they talk about politics. Schumpeter wondered why. \u201cThe answer is they have incentives to know something about their business,\u201d Schleicher said. \u201cAnd their incentive to know specifics about politics is extremely weak.\u201d",

        "text": "Who Are Kamala Harris\u2019s 1.5 Million New Donors?\nWho Are Kamala Harris\u2019s 1.5 Million New Donors?\n\nAn unprecedented wave of small-dollar donations for Harris After Biden dropped out of the race, donations poured into the Harris campaign faster than they had for any presidential candidate this cycle. Daily Biden/Harris donors 150,000 300,000 450,000 600,000 donors Jan. 1, 2024 April 1 July 1 Source: Federal Election Commission The New York Times\n\nWhen President Biden ended his presidential campaign on July 21, making Vice President Kamala Harris the presumptive Democratic nominee, he unleashed the biggest wave of small-dollar enthusiasm the race has seen.\n\nMore than 1.5 million new donors gave to the Harris campaign in the last 11 days of July, according to estimates from a New York Times analysis of donor data filed with the Federal Election Commission. That figure comprises 40 percent of all donors to the Biden and now Harris campaign, which has been raising money since April 2023.\n\nDonors both old and new gave to the newly renamed Harris campaign Both donors who had given to the Biden re-election campaign and new people who had not previously contributed rushed to donate to the Harris campaign. Biden donors Harris donors who had not given to Biden Harris donors who had previously given to Biden 150,000 300,000 450,000 600,000 donors July 1 July 31 Source: Federal Election Commission The New York Times\n\nMr. Biden\u2019s existing donor base was enthusiastic, as well: About 680,000 people who had previously donated to Mr. Biden \u2014 just over one-third of his previous donors \u2014 came back to give more to Ms. Harris in those 11 days.\n\nMore than half a million people total on July 21, and more than 600,000 on July 22, gave to the Democratic presidential campaign through ActBlue, its official fund-raising platform. Their contributions totaled more than $80 million in the first two days. From July 21 through the end of the month, the newly renamed Harris campaign raised $183 million through ActBlue.\n\nThe Times\u2019s analysis also combined the donor records with voter registration records to show that new Harris donors were much younger than Biden donors had been. Just 10 percent of Mr. Biden\u2019s donors in July were under 45 years old, compared with 28 percent of Ms. Harris\u2019s donors.\n\nAge of donors to Biden compared with Harris 4% 2 Pct. of donors 0 2 4% Age <25 35 45 55 65 75 85+ = = Median age of Biden donors: 66 Median age of Harris donors: 56 Sources: Federal Election Commission; L2 Among donors who gave to the Democratic presidential campaigns in July via ActBlue. The New York Times\n\nThe share of Ms. Harris\u2019s newly acquired donors who were women under 45 was 17 percent \u2014 more than double the share of Mr. Biden\u2019s donors who were younger women. Younger men also made up a greater share of Ms. Harris\u2019s donors.\n\nAcross all ages, slightly more than 60 percent of both Mr. Biden\u2019s and Ms. Harris\u2019s donors were women.\n\nIn a geographic comparison of Mr. Biden\u2019s donors and Ms. Harris\u2019s, the makeup of both pools was very similar. Harris donors were slightly more likely to come from more educated areas: ZIP codes where more than half of those 25 and over had a bachelor\u2019s degree. Ms. Harris also claimed a slightly higher share of first-time small-dollar donors from ZIP codes where more than 5 percent of the population was Black, according to the most recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau. And differences between the candidates were minor when it came to their ZIP codes\u2019 median household income.\n\nBreakdown of Biden and Harris donors by ZIP code area: Percent of adults with bachelor\u2019s degree 20% 10 Pct. of donors 0 10 20% 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% = = Percent of Black residents 40% 20 Pct. of donors 0 20 40% 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25%+ = = Median household income 30% 20 10 Pct. of donors 0 10 20 30% $0 $50,000 $100,000 $150,000 $200,000 $250,000+ = = Sources: Federal Election Commission; Social Explorer 2022 5-year ACS data Charts compare donors who gave to the Democratic presidential campaigns between April 25, 2023 and July 31, 2024 based on their ZIP code tabulation area. Percent of adults with bachelor\u2019s degree is among those 25 and older. The New York Times\n\nThe Times\u2019s analysis did not look at contributions by large donors who give directly to the campaign, fund-raising committees or super PACs without going through ActBlue.\n\nLarge donors had been threatening to flee the party after Mr. Biden\u2019s disappointing debate performance, and while some small donors had rushed to the president\u2019s support, they were far outnumbered by the wave of money that flooded in for former President Donald J. Trump after his felony conviction and the attempt on his life.\n\nFull details on donations by large donors will not become clear until October, when the campaign\u2019s associated fund-raising committees are required to file reports with the Federal Election Commission. But on just the strength of small donors alone, the end of July was the most significant fund-raising moment for the Biden or Harris campaign of the entire cycle thus far, and the biggest week for Democratic fund-raising on ActBlue since the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\n\nThe Harris campaign in July announced that it had raised over $310 million, more than double what Mr. Trump\u2019s had, on the strength of fund-raising in the last 10 days of the month.",

        "text": "Robert F Kennedy Jr to drop out of presidential race by end of week \u2013 report\nRobert F Kennedy Jr is set to drop his maverick campaign for president, it has been reported, amid speculation the independent and environmental lawyer will throw his support behind Donald Trump.\n\nThe ABC network, citing \u201csources familiar with the decision\u201d, reported that Kennedy would formally leave the race on Friday. The report followed an announcement on his campaign website that he would make a statement that day \u201cabout the present historical moment and his path forward\u201d in Phoenix that would be live-streamed on X and other social media.\n\nSpeculation that Kennedy could abandon his presidential bid intensified after his running mate, Nicole Shanahan, revealed on a podcast on Tuesday he was considering that option \u2013 and considering endorsing Trump, the Republican nominee. Shanahan suggested Kennedy\u2019s continued candidacy risked diverting support away from Trump, thereby helping to elect Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nHer comments were immediately welcomed by Trump, who told CNN that Kennedy \u2013 who he denounced as recently as April as a \u201cDemocrat plant\u201d and a \u201cradical left liberal\u201d \u2013 was \u201ca brilliant guy\u201d.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know he was thinking about getting out, but if he is thinking about getting out, certainly I\u2019d be open to it,\u201d said Trump, who, perhaps not coincidentally, is also due to speak in the Phoenix area on Friday, at a campaign rally.\n\nIn truth, the pair seem to have been in contact for weeks amid an apparent rapprochement.\n\nA leaked recording of a telephone call between them emerged last month during the Republican national convention \u2013 just days after Trump survived an assassination attempt \u2013 when the former president solicited Kennedy\u2019s support and the two discussed the possibility of Kennedy joining a future administration.\n\nTrump also appeared to endorse some of the anti-vaccine theories, for which Kennedy has become noted, during the call.\n\nIn an interview with NBC News, JD Vance, Trump\u2019s running mate, acknowledged there had been a stream of \u201ccommunication\u201d between the two campaigns.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to RFK personally, but I know there\u2019s been a lot of communication back and forth between RFK \u2026 [and] this campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cOur argument to RFK, and I\u2019ll make it right now, because, of course, he hasn\u2019t dropped out yet, is, look: if you want a Democratic party that protected American workers and stood for strong borders, maybe disagreed with Republicans on things like tax policy, that party doesn\u2019t exist any more.\u201d\n\nKennedy initially sought the Democratic nomination before abandoning that attempt to launch an independent campaign.\n\nHis presidential bid has been hit by a spate of damaging stories that have undermined his efforts to present himself as a serious figure.\n\nAn allegation surfaced in a Vanity Fair article that he had groped a family babysitter, to which Kennedy responded not with a denial, but by saying: \u201cI am not a church boy.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI said in my announcement speech that I have so many skeletons in my closet that if they could all vote, I could run for king of the world.\u201d\n\nA further embarrassing disclosure was unearthed by the New Yorker, which described how Kennedy once left the carcass of a dead bear cub in Central Park and placed a bicycle next to it to make it look like an accident.\n\nKennedy pre-empted the article by posting a video on X of him admitting the episode in a conversation with Roseanne Barr, as the pair sat in a spacious kitchen.\n\nThe campaign has also run into money troubles in recent weeks, as Kennedy\u2019s poll standing has dropped. It reportedly ended July $3.5m in debt, while Shanahan \u2013 who has contributed her own funds to it \u2013 was recently given a $1m refund.\n\nHarris campaign manager Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon said she did not have any concerns about Kennedy potentially dropping out and endorsing Trump. \u201cWe are very confident that the vice-president is going to win whether she\u2019s running against one candidate or multiple candidates,\u201d she said at a CNN-Politico grill event. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s really going to interfere with the race too much.\u201d",

        "text": "From Sinatra to Streisand: 100 Years of Celebrity Political Endorsements\nAmerican celebrities have been aligning themselves with presidential candidates for more than a century. The trend began with the 1920 election when celebrities were pulled onto front porch campaigns.\n\nWhile political campaigns have long drawn the influence of star power, the actual impact on a campaign is squishy at best. An August 2024 Harvard study showed that while celebrity association helps drive more voters to the polls, whether or not it affects outcomes is hard to quantify.\n\n\u201cI really wonder if any celebrity endorsement ever won a candidate a race, unless of course they were celebrities already, such as George Murphy, Ronald Reagan and Arnold Schwarzenegger,\u201d says New York University\u2019s Tisch School of the Arts professor Laurence Maslon. \u201cI think the reality and the irony is that an endorsement does more for the endorser than the endorsee.\u201d\n\nPresidential Election Facts\n\nHe explains that most celebrity endorsements are like a lobbying event, as the bold-faced name makes noise and raises money but is also then \u201daffiliated with the potential power of a winning candidate. In other words, the celebrity has more to gain than the candidate.\u201d\n\nHere are seven celebrities through history who lent their star power to political campaigns.\n\n1. Al Jolson\n\nEven before entertainer Al Jolson starred in the first movie talkie The Jazz Singer in 1927, he was already using his voice on the campaign trail, supporting Warren G. Harding in 1920. As one of the country's most popular celebrities of the era, he joined the Republican senator at his Marion, Ohio, home as part of the politician\u2019s \u201cfront porch\u201d presidential campaign.\n\nRecruiting a group of fellow actors, Jolson led a march through the Ohio streets to the candidate\u2019s house, where he performed a song he penned, \u201cHarding You\u2019re The Man For Us.\u201d The tune became the official Republican campaign song with lyrics like: \u201cSo it\u2019s Harding, lead the GOP / Harding, on to victory / We\u2019re here to make a fuss / Warren Harding you\u2019re the man for us.\u201d\n\nBettmann / Contributor/Getty Images A delegation of Broadway stars, including Al Jolson, at right, at the White House in support of Calvin Coolidge, second from right, in October 1924.\n\nHarding won, becoming the 29th president, but died in office in 1923 from a heart attack, succeeded by his vice president Calvin Coolidge. Jolson went on to campaign for Coolidge during the 1924 election.\n\n2. Babe Ruth\n\nBaseball great Babe Ruth may have best been known for homers, but off the field, he had a reputation for schmoozing with presidential candidates. When poet Carl Sandburg asked him which president was the best role model for young men, Ruth replied, \u201cPresident Wilson was always a great friend of mine.\u201d Though the extent of their ties is unclear, Wilson was the first president to attend a World Series game in 1915, when Ruth was just a rookie pitcher.\n\nThough Ruth was a Democrat, he reportedly considered going to one of Harding\u2019s front porch sessions for the money, though it didn\u2019t end up happening. That said, Harding invited Ruth to the White House while in office, and the president was spotted in the stadium during some of the athlete\u2019s most legendary games. After the president's death, Ruth wrote his widow a condolence letter, referring to him as a \u201cpersonal friend.\u201d\n\nBettmann / Contributor/Getty Images Baseball great Babe Ruth wearing a 'Vote for Al Smith' sign in an October 19, 1928 photo.\n\nBut Ruth\u2019s greatest political move was during the 1928 campaign when Hebert Hoover asked to pose for a photo at Washington\u2019s Griffith Stadium that September. The baseball player turned him down, reportedly saying he was for his opponent Al Smith. Though Ruth later released a statement calling it all a \u201cmisunderstanding,\u201d he stuck with Smith, as a fellow Catholic who related to growing up modestly. In a 1928 radio address, he said: \u201cWhat a wonderful thing it is to think that\u2026There is a chance for every boy to get to the top in America, whether he wants to be a president or a ball player.\u201d\n\n3. Frank Sinatra\n\nWith a mom (Dolly) who was involved with politics in his hometown of Hoboken, New Jersey, it was inevitable that Frank Sinatra would follow in her footsteps. During Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s 1944 reelection campaign, the president invited the crooner to the White House. Bing Crosby had already shown his support for FDR\u2019s opponent Thomas E. Dewey, so siding with a popular singer seemed like a savvy move.\n\nSinatra joined other well-known names like Humphrey Bogart, Rita Hayworth and Orson Welles on the 32nd president\u2019s campaign trail, donating money and speaking on radio addresses and at Carnegie Hall. At one point, he called him \u201cthe greatest guy alive today and here\u2019s a little guy from Hoboken shaking his hand.\u201d He even joined Welles at a Fenway Park rally in Boston the weekend before the election.\n\nGAB Archive/Redferns/Getty Images American actor and singer Frank Sinatra with presidential candidate John F. Kennedy at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas, February 1960.\n\nThe New Jersey Democrat then threw himself into John F. Kennedy\u2019s 1960 campaign. Along with the Rat Pack, Sinatra held numerous fundraisers and turned his song \u201cHigh Hopes\u201d into the campaign anthem. \u201cSinatra was given a seat at the table\u2014literally,\u201d Maslon says, noting the singer was put in charge of Kennedy's Inauguration Ball.\n\nBut it all fell apart when JFK didn't show up for a Palm Spring weekend at Sinatra\u2019s home in 1962 and vacationed with Crosby instead. \u201cKennedy was told in no uncertain terms that Sinatra was now toxic because of apparent mob connections,\u201d Maslon explained. \u201cSinatra had spent a fortune preparing to host the president and was broken-hearted when he was passed over. Apparently, it turned him into a Republican.\u201d\n\nBy 1970, he was supporting Ronald Reagan for California governor, and eventually endorsed the actor-turned-presidential candidate, whom he called an \u201cold friend,\u201d in 1980.\n\n4. Judy Garland\n\nLibrary of Congress Judy Garland seated next to Senator John F. Kennedy at a dinner at the Beverly Hills Hilton, during the 1960 Democratic National Convention, Los Angeles.\n\nActress Judy Garland had a special sort of relationship with John F. Kennedy. Daughter Liza Minelli said in the authorized biography Judy that while filming her show The Judy Garland Show in 1963, days would get so tough that at the end of the week, she\u2019d say she was calling \u201cJack\u201d and call the White House to talk to JFK. At the end of every call, Minelli recalls her mother giving into Kennedy\u2019s request to sing the last eight bars of her famous The Wizard of Oz (1939) song, \u201cSomewhere Over the Rainbow.\u201d\n\nBut one thing\u2019s for sure, Garland was a supporter, standing by JFK\u2019s side at the 1960 Democratic National Convention. She was such a close friend, she had her own house near the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts.\n\n5. Sammy Davis Jr.\n\nWhile Sammy Davis Jr. was a campaign supporter, his efforts didn\u2019t always have the right effect.\n\n\u201cDespite his intense lobbying for JFK, Davis was actively disinvited from the Inauguration Ball, told by southern Democrats that no Black entertainer who was married to a white woman would be tolerated at the ball,\u201d Maslon says, adding that he was left \u201cbrokenhearted by the betrayal.\u201d\n\nAt the 1972 Republican National Convention\u2019s Young Voters Rally, Davis served as the master of ceremony. At one point, Davis spontaneously hugged Richard Nixon from behind as both men grin\u2014a moment that Nixon called the most memorable in his memoirs.\n\n\u00a9 CORBIS/Corbis via Getty Images Sammy Davis Jr. gives President Richard Nixon a hug on stage, August 22, 1972.\n\nAfter the embrace, he told the crowd that Davis had visited him in the White House a few weeks before, talking about their shared backgrounds coming from poor families. \u201cI want to make this pledge to Sammy, I want to make it to everybody here, whether you happen to be black or white, or young or old, and all of those who are listening, I believe in the American dream,\u201d Nixon said. \u201cSammy Davis believed in it. We believe in it because we have seen it come true in our own lives.\u201d\n\nBut the hug was not received well. \u201cThis completely ruined Davis's relationship with the Black community and he was nearly booed off the stage at a Chicago rally for Jesse Jackson's charity Rainbow PUSH a few months later,\u201d Maslon said. \u201cNixon dangled some vague appointments in front of Davis when he won reelection, but again\u2014and poignantly\u2014the endorsement caused far more consequences for the entertainer than the candidate. Who knows if Davis's hug helped get Nixon even one more Black vote?\u201d\n\n6. Jim Brown\n\nJim Brown has been called one of the greatest football players of all time. In 1968, Brown leveraged that legacy to support presidential candidate Richard Nixon.\n\n\u201cNixon did his best to win favor from Black athletes,\u201d says Northwestern University history professor Brett Gadsden. \u201cBlack celebrities might matter a bit more on the Republican side of the ledger during that period, especially given conservatives\u2019 historic opposition to race reforms.\u201d\n\nBrown avidly supported Nixon in 1968, as the candidate promised federal programs that would drive up Black ownership, fostering more jobs, opportunity, pride, and power. Before his death in 2023, Brown supported Donald Trump as well.\n\n7. Barbra Streisand\n\nWhen Barbra Streisand supported Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign, it wasn\u2019t the first time she had backed a Clinton presidential run. The singer had also been a staunch supporter of Bill Clinton\u2019s 1996 election and had performed at Beverly Hills fundraiser for Clinton, emceed by Tom Hanks, with the Eagles, Neville Brothers and Chicago, as well as readings by Maya Angelou.\n\nBut perhaps Streisand\u2019s most outspoken moment was when the political magazine George accused her of giving Bill Clinton free advertising during an online chat encouraging young folks to vote. She retorted in a letter to the magazine stating: \u201cI am a strong supporter of President Clinton and many of his policies,\u201d citing key issues: \u201cpreserving the environment, ensuring a woman\u2019s right to choose, reforming education, strengthening gun-control laws, fighting for health care reform, saving Social Security, and increasing the minimum wage.\u201d\n\nShe went on to say that despite being a Democrat, she had also \u201coccasionally\u201d supported Republican and Independent candidates, writing: \u201cI judge each candidate by his or her record and not by party affiliation.\u201d",

        "text": "As Robert F. Kennedy Jr. exits, a look at who supported him in the 2024 presidential race\nThen-presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. spoke at the Libertarian National Convention in Washington, D.C., on May 24, 2024. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. announced he would suspend his presidential campaign on Friday \u2013 adding yet another shakeup to the 2024 contest.\n\nHow we did this Pew Research Center conducted this analysis to better understand voters who said they planned to support Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in the 2024 presidential election. For this analysis, we surveyed 9,201 adults \u2013 including 7,569 registered voters \u2013 from Aug. 5 to 11, 2024. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), a group of people recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses who have agreed to take surveys regularly. This kind of recruitment gives nearly all U.S. adults a chance of selection. Surveys were conducted either online or by telephone with a live interviewer. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other factors. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology. Here are the questions used for this analysis, the topline and the survey methodology.\n\nThough the third-party candidate was capturing about 15% of registered voters in early July, he lost significant ground after that. In early August, just 7% of voters said they leaned toward or preferred Kennedy for president. This data comes from Pew Research Center surveys conducted in July and August.\n\nAs RFK Jr. exits the race, here are some findings about his supporters:\n\nWhat Kennedy voters did after Biden withdrew from race\n\nMany of Kennedy\u2019s July supporters decided to back a different candidate after Joe Biden left the race. These voters picked Kamala Harris over Donald Trump by two-to-one.\n\nAmong voters who said they backed Kennedy in July, a majority (61%) supported a different candidate in August. Roughly four-in-ten (39%) continued to back RFK Jr. Far more of those who changed their preference decided to support Harris (39%) than Trump (20%).\n\nKennedy\u2019s voters were lukewarm in their support\n\nIn August, just 18% of Kennedy\u2019s supporters said they backed him strongly. This compared with nearly two-thirds of Trump (64%) and Harris (62%) supporters.\n\nWhich voters were more likely to support RFK Jr.\n\nKennedy\u2019s remaining supporters in August were far younger than Harris\u2019 or Trump\u2019s. About two-thirds of Kennedy\u2019s supporters were under 50, compared with 46% of Harris\u2019 and 38% of Trump\u2019s.\n\nWhile roughly half of Harris and Trump supporters follow what is going on in government and public affairs most of the time, only about a quarter (24%) of Kennedy supporters do.\n\nKennedy\u2019s supporters also were far less likely to say they were highly motivated to vote in the presidential election. In August, the following shares of each candidate\u2019s supporters said they were extremely motivated to vote:\n\nHarris: 70%\n\nTrump: 72%\n\nKennedy: 23%\n\nMost Kennedy supporters did not identify as partisans \u2013 and a majority held unfavorable views of both Harris and Trump\n\nMost of Kennedy\u2019s remaining supporters did not call themselves partisans. Just 14% consider themselves Republicans while 12% consider themselves Democrats.\n\n\n\nThe vast majority of his supporters (74%) say they are independent or something else. A larger share lean toward the Republican Party than the Democratic Party (40% vs. 26%).\n\nIn August, Kennedy supporters were sour on both Harris and Trump \u2013 61% said they had an unfavorable view of both candidates.\n\nNote: Here are the questions used for this analysis, the topline and the survey methodology.",

        "text": "Some Good News for Donald Trump: We Already Use Paper Ballots\nDonald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are calling for the use of paper ballots in the 2024 election. They\u2019re right on the policy: paper ballots are one of the most important security measures states can adopt. When selections are recorded on paper, voters can easily verify that their ballot accurately reflects their choices before casting their vote. But they\u2019re misleading on the facts: states are already doing this. Nearly all votes cast in the 2024 election will be recorded on paper.\n\nMaybe Trump and Kennedy are just a little behind the times. Or maybe their false claims are another attempt to undermine trust in our elections through misinformation.\n\nThe return to widespread paper ballots has been a remarkable success story for election security. After Congress passed the Help America Vote Act in 2002, which phased out the use of lever machines and punch cards following controversies in the 2000 election, many states adopted Direct Recording Electronic voting systems. These touch screen machines store votes directly into computer memory. While some also printed paper records of voters\u2019 selections, many of the machines in use did not have this feature. As a result, around a quarter of all voters lived in jurisdictions with paperless voting equipment just 10 years ago.\n\nBut the 2016 election, which featured Russian cyberattacks on election infrastructure, put long-standing security concerns about paperless voting equipment in the spotlight. With the aid of over $800 million in federal funding, states rapidly moved away from these outdated systems.\n\nAs states continue to upgrade voting equipment and phase out paperless systems, nearly all voters now live in jurisdictions with voting systems that have a paper record of every vote. Nationwide, we expect around 98 percent of all votes to be cast on paper in the 2024 general election (based on data from Verified Voting and the Election Assistance Commission\u2019s Election Administration and Voting Survey). This represents an increase from 93 percent of votes four years ago. Counties in all but two states have moved to voting systems with a paper trail; the remaining counties in Louisiana and Texas plan to transition soon, but this will likely not be completed by the fall.\n\nImportantly, all the swing states that are most likely to determine the winner of the 2024 presidential election \u2014 Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin \u2014 use voting systems with paper records. In some states, voters fill out paper ballots by hand. In others, after the voter makes selections on a touch screen, the machine prints a paper ballot or record for the voter to review before casting their vote.\n\nPaper ballots facilitate postelection audits, which election officials use to verify the accuracy of machine counts. Forty-eight states require a postelection audit of some kind. In every swing state, election officials hand-count a sample of paper records and compare them to electronic counts to confirm that voting machines correctly counted ballots and produced an accurate total. With these multiple processes, the public gets the best of both worlds \u2014 election officials use voting machines to count all ballots initially because they are more accurate, faster, and cheaper than counting all ballots by hand, while human checks verify that these machines are counting ballots correctly.\n\nPaper ballots are just one of many measures that election officials deploy to count ballots and ensure accurate results. Other measures include using voting systems certified to federal and state security standards and testing voting machines before voters cast their ballots to confirm that the machines are working properly. But paper ballots are particularly important for guaranteeing confidence in election outcomes. If there is any doubt about the accuracy of electronic counts, election officials can fall back on the paper record for confirmation.",

        "text": "Robert F Kennedy Jr suspends US presidential bid and endorses Trump\nRobert F Kennedy Jr, the scion of the Democratic Kennedy family whose independent presidential campaign threatened to draw votes from both Republicans and Democrats, has suspended his campaign and endorsed Donald Trump.\n\nKennedy said he would be removing his name from the ballot in critical swing states, but will remain on the ballot in other states and some voters could still cast ballots for him.\n\nIn a rambling statement that started three-quarters of a hour behind schedule, Kennedy said he would be giving his support to Trump following a series of conversations with him, the first of which took place days after the Republican nominee survived an assassination attempt on 13 July.\n\n\u201cI was surprised to discover that we are aligned on many key issues,\u201d Kennedy said, explaining that he and Trump met several times. \u201cIn those meetings, he suggested that we join forces as a unity party. We talked about Abraham Lincoln\u2019s team of rivals. That arrangement would allow us to disagree publicly and privately and seriously, if need be, on issues over which we differ while working together on the existential issues upon which we are in concordance.\u201d\n\nHe also praised Trump\u2019s call for an end to Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine, which he blamed on the US and the Nato alliance.\n\nKennedy said the war was one of three \u201cgreat causes\u201d that drove him to enter the race and ultimately to give his support to Trump, with the others being free speech and what he called \u201cthe war on our children\u201d, a phrase covering his well-known opposition to vaccines, about which he has peddled conspiracy theories.\n\nKennedy, whose uncle, John F Kennedy, and father, Robert F Kennedy, were both assassinated, announced that he was running against Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination in April 2023.\n\nHe left that race last October, however, warning that under the two-party system the US was \u201ccycling from despair to rage and back to despair\u201d, and ran as an independent.\n\nKennedy\u2019s campaign was seen as a threat to both Harris and Trump, but in the past few months Kennedy was dogged by controversies. He was accused of assaulting a former babysitter, it emerged that Kennedy believed that part of his brain had been eaten by a worm, and in early August he admitted to having staged a bizarre bicycle hit-and-run incident with a dead bear cub in a New York City park.\n\nAs his election bid floundered, Kennedy reportedly made overtures to the Harris campaign in August to discuss dropping out and endorsing her in exchange for a job in her administration, while he was also courted by Trump in July.\n\nHaving initially hovered at about 10% in national polling, Kennedy\u2019s popularity dropped amid the scandals, with the 70-year-old averaging about half of that in August. The campaign struggled to raise money, with just $3.9m cash-on-hand at the end of July, and debts of $3.5m. Politico reported that Kennedy spent more than $7m in July \u2013 more than the $5.6m he raised.\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans watched Kennedy\u2019s campaign closely, however, mindful that his mix of vaccine skepticism, hardline policies on the border, and ties to the most famous Democratic family in politics, could draw votes in key swing states.\n\nKennedy, as a former Democrat, was initially seen as more of a threat to Democrats winning the presidential election, but in recent months he was seen to be drawing more votes from Trump, something his running mate, Nicole Shanahan, admitted on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s two options that we\u2019re looking at,\u201d Shanahan told the Impact Theory podcast.\n\n\u201cOne is staying in, forming that new party, but we run the risk of a Kamala Harris and [Tim] Walz presidency, because we draw votes from Trump. Or we walk away right now and join forces with Donald Trump. We walk away from that and we explain to our base why we\u2019re making this decision.\u201d\n\nThere has been evidence that Trump did see Kennedy as a threat.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The video came after reports \u2013 denied by Kennedy \u2013 that he might drop out and endorse Trump.\n\nAt an event in Nevada, Trump thanked Kennedy for his decision to endorse him, and in a statement the campaign called the decision \u201cgood news\u201d.\n\nThe Harris campaign responded less directly, with a statement apparently directed at Kennedy supporters: \u201cfor any American out there who is tired of Donald Trump and looking for a new way forward, ours is a campaign for you.\u201d\n\nKennedy\u2019s apparent efforts to meet with Harris to discuss endorsing her in exchange for a possible cabinet secretary position were snubbed by the Harris campaign.\n\nHis run for president has been controversial. Recently Kennedy responded to an allegation that he sexually assaulted an employee by stating: \u201cI am not a church boy,\u201d while in July 2023, a video surfaced of Kennedy making false claims that Covid-19 was \u201cethnically targeted\u201d to attack Black people and white people while sparing Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people.\n\nLast year Kennedy claimed that wifi causes \u201cleaky brain\u201d and has linked antidepressants to school shootings. In 2023 he also claimed that chemicals in water were making children transgender, while Kennedy has longstanding, and wrong, beliefs about apparently any and all vaccines.\n\nIn a joint statement, five of Kennedy\u2019s siblings \u2013 Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, Courtney Kennedy, Kerry Kennedy, Chris Kennedy and Rory Kennedy \u2013 denounced his endorsement of Trump as a betrayal of the values of their father, Robert F Kennedy, the former attorney general and Democratic senator.\n\n\u201cWe want an America filled with hope and bound together by a shared vision of a brighter future, a future defined by individual freedom, economic promise and national pride,\u201d they said. \u201cWe believe in Harris and Walz. Our brother Bobby\u2019s decision to endorse Trump today is a betrayal of the values that our father and our family hold most dear. It is a sad ending to a sad story.\u201d",

        "text": "Third-party candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr suspends US presidential bid\nKennedy throws his support to Republican candidate Donald Trump, as he suspends his long-shot run for the White House.\n\nThird-party presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr has suspended his long-shot bid for the White House, throwing his weight instead behind the Republican candidate, former United States President Donald Trump.\n\nFriday\u2019s announcement was the culmination of weeks of speculation, as Kennedy receded in the polls. Still, he offered a message of defiance, denouncing his campaign\u2019s \u201cnaysayers\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe proved them wrong,\u201d Kennedy said at a campaign stop in Phoenix, Arizona. \u201cBeneath the radar of mainstream media organs, we inspired a massive independent political movement.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn an honest system, I believe I would have won the election,\u201d he later added.\n\nStill, he acknowledged his odds were dim. \u201cI cannot in good conscience ask my staff and volunteers to keep working their long hours or ask my donors to keep giving when I cannot honestly tell them that I have a real path to the White House.\u201d\n\nKennedy emphasised he was \u201cnot terminating\u201d his campaign, only suspending it. But he said he would be removing his name from the ballot in states where he feared drawing votes away from Trump.\n\n\u201cIn about 10 battleground states, where my presence would be a spoiler, I\u2019m going to remove my name. And I\u2019ve already started that process and urge voters not to vote for me,\u201d he said.\n\nHe explained that he and Trump shared concerns about \u201cfree speech, the war in Ukraine and the war on our children\u201d.\n\nIn the lead-up to Kennedy\u2019s remarks, his campaign teased that his Arizona speech would address \u201cthe present historical moment and his path forward\u201d.\n\nThe speculation of a possible Kennedy-Trump alliance was amplified by the speech\u2019s location. Trump himself was set to arrive in Arizona for a rally in the Phoenix suburb of Glendale, just three hours after Kennedy\u2019s remarks.\n\nOn Thursday, Kennedy filed paperwork withdrawing his candidacy in Arizona, in preparation for Friday\u2019s speech.\n\nWho is Robert F Kennedy Jr?\n\nA former environmental lawyer, Kennedy launched his presidential campaign in April 2023, initially entering the race as a Democrat.\n\n\u201cMy mission over the next 18 months of this campaign and throughout my presidency will be to end the corrupt merger of state and corporate power,\u201d he said at his campaign launch.\n\nHis decision to run sent shockwaves across the political community. Kennedy is the scion of a storied political family with strong ties to the Democratic Party: His uncle John F Kennedy was a president in the 1960s, and his father, Robert F Kennedy, was a US senator and attorney general.\n\nBoth were assassinated, the former while in office and the latter while campaigning for the presidency.\n\nThe younger Kennedy\u2019s decision to mount a bid for the presidency in 2024 immediately put him in a match-up against President Joe Biden, a fellow Democrat who was, at the time, seeking re-election.\n\nIt also put him at odds with members of his own family, who denounced his decision to challenge Biden.\n\nKennedy\u2019s youngest sibling, Rory Kennedy, voiced opposition even before he announced his presidential bid in April.\n\n\u201cI admire his past work as an environmentalist,\u201d Rory told the news outlet CNN. \u201cBut due to a wide range of Bobby\u2019s positions, I\u2019m supporting President Biden.\u201d\n\nKennedy has faced widespread criticism, including from his family, for sharing vaccine-related conspiracy theories and promoting baseless treatments during the COVID-19 pandemic. He has also spread false assertions about the origins of HIV and the health effects of Wi-Fi internet.\n\nFacing pressure from Democrats, Kennedy eventually switched tactic, relaunching his campaign as an independent, third-party ticket in October 2023.\n\nStill, that did not allay Democratic criticism, as some feared he would be a \u201cspoiler candidate\u201d peeling voters away from the party in the general election.\n\nWhat happened to his campaign?\n\nKennedy\u2019s campaigned ultimately failed to generate much traction. An ABC News poll released earlier this month found that his voter support dwindled to 5 percent, down from a high of 12 percent in April.\n\nThat was well below the Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, and Trump, both of whom were polling between 45 and 50 percent support.\n\nHis campaign has also generated negative publicity for bizarre revelations over the course of Kennedy\u2019s run.\n\nIn early August, for instance, Kennedy appeared in a video with the comedian Roseanne Barr in which he recounted how he left a dead bear cub in New York City\u2019s Central Park, staged to look as if it had been run over by a bike.\n\nKennedy insisted he had not killed the bear himself but rather scooped it off the road after it had been hit by a car in upstate New York.\n\nAs his poll numbers wobbled, rumours of a potential alliance with Trump grew louder.\n\nIn July, Kennedy\u2019s son Bobby Kennedy III briefly posted a video on social media showing his father on the phone with Trump. In the call, Trump recounts surviving an assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally and appears to court the independent candidate\u2019s backing.\n\n\u201cI would love you to do stuff,\u201d Trump is heard on speakerphone, telling Kennedy. \u201cI think it would be so good for you, and we\u2019re going to win.\u201d\n\nThat video was later deleted, and Kennedy apologised to Trump for the leak of the private conversation.\n\nKennedy\u2019s running mate, lawyer Nicole Shanahan, also appeared on a podcast, Impact Theory, earlier this week to talk about potential avenues for the future of their campaign.\n\nOne path, she said, would be to found a new party. The other would be to join forces with Trump.\n\n\u201cWe walk away right now and join forces with Donald Trump,\u201d Shanahan said, offering that as a possible avenue. \u201cWe walk away from that, and we explain to our base why we\u2019re making this decision.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Trump himself told the news programme Fox & Friends that he would gladly accept Kennedy\u2019s endorsement.\n\n\u201cIf he endorsed me, I would be honoured by it,\u201d Trump said.\n\nWhat did Kennedy say in his speech?\n\nWhen Kennedy finally did announce his campaign\u2019s suspension on Friday, he began with a broadside against the Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cI began this journey as a Democrat, the party of my father, my uncle, the party I pledged my own allegiance to, long before I was old enough to vote,\u201d Kennedy said.\n\n\u201cBack then, the Democrats were the champions of the constitution, of civil rights. The Democrats stood against authoritarianism, against censorship, against colonialism, imperialism and unjust wars. We were the party of labour, of the working class.\u201d\n\nBut times had changed, Kennedy explained, and his party allegiance had changed with them.\n\n\u201cI left that party in October because it had departed so dramatically from the core values I grew up with,\u201d he said. He also dedicated a stretch of his speech to slamming the mainstream media for \u201csystematic censorship\u201d.\n\n\u201cAre we really still a role model for democracy in this country? Or have we made it kind of a joke?\u201d he asked, alleging he and Trump had faced media censorship and \u201ccontinual legal warfare\u201d during the race.\n\nKennedy also took direct aim at Harris, calling her speech on Thursday night accepting the Democratic Party nomination \u201cbellicose\u201d and \u201cbelligerent\u201d.\n\nBy contrast, Kennedy praised Trump for his desire to distance the US from Ukraine, an ally that is attemping to fend off a full-scale Russian invasion.\n\n\u201cI was a ferocious critic of many of the policies during his first administration, and there are still issues and approaches upon which we continue to have very serious differences,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut we are aligned with each other on other key issues, like ending the forever wars, ending the childhood disease epidemic, securing the border.\u201d\n\nKennedy said Harris rebuffed his request for a meeting, but Trump, by contrast, \u201casked to enlist me in his administration\u201d and \u201cjoin forces as a unity party\u201d.\n\n\u201cSuspending my candidacy is a heart-rending decision for me, but I\u2019m convinced it\u2019s the best hope for ending the Ukraine war and ending the chronic disease epidemic that is eroding our nation\u2019s vitality from the inside,\u201d he said, pointing to widespread health concerns like diabetes and obesity.\n\nBut while Kennedy said he felt \u201cinternal peace\u201d about his decision, his family once again denounced his political manoeuvring.\n\n\u201cWe want an America filled with hope and bound together by a shared vision of a brighter future,\u201d five of his siblings, including Rory, wrote in a statement on Friday.\n\n\u201cOur brother Bobby\u2019s decision to endorse Trump today is a betrayal of the values that our father and our family hold most dear. It is a sad ending to a sad story.\u201d",

        "text": "The 2024 US Election's Impact on China\nTrump v Harris: How Will the 2024 Presidential Election Outcome Impact US-China Relations?\n\nThe 2024 US presidential election will set the course for relations with China for the next four years, with profound implications for global trade, diplomacy, and business exchange. While Donald Trump and Kamala Harris share similar visions for their engagement with China, important distinctions between their policies could send bilateral relations and global trade onto very different trajectories. We discuss the US election\u2019s impact on China relations in the event of a Trump or Harris win and look at the potential implications for businesses in China.\n\nUPDATE: On July 21, 2024, incumbent President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential election race, opening up a space for a new candidate for the Democratic Party. Shortly after, he officially endorsed his Vice President, Kamala Harris, as the Democratic Party candidate. On August 22, 2024, during the Democratic National Convention (DNC), Harris was officially nominated as the presidential candidate by the Democratic Party.\n\nAs Harris has served as Vice President under the Biden Administration, her foreign policy will be similar to President Biden\u2019s, including policy positions toward China. This means that the trajectory of China-US relations under a potential Harris presidency would not be drastically different from that under a second Biden term. Nonetheless, her potential accession to the highest office will open up new questions and possibilities for the relationship. China Briefing will continue to monitor events in the US presidential election and provide analysis of the potential impact on relations with China.\n\nAmerican voters head to the polls on November 5, 2024, to elect their next president, facing a consequential choice that could shape the direction of the nation for the next four years.\n\nAt this pivotal moment, we have unique insight into the potential trajectory for US-China relations in 2025, as both candidate\u2019s have served in prior administrations, providing a blueprint for the kinds of policies and tactics they would adopt. Broadly speaking, the two candidates have similar visions regarding their policies in China. Both Trump and Harris share a resolute stance on addressing trade imbalances and national security concerns, underscoring the bipartisan consensus on adopting a hardline approach to engagement with China.\n\nNonetheless, from trade policies to technology strategies, the campaign agendas of Trump and Harris offer slightly diverging paths, each carrying profound implications for the future of US-China relations.\n\nIn this article, we look at the key differences and similarities between Trump\u2019s and Harris\u2019s China agendas to discuss the possible implications of a second term for either candidate, as well as the impact the outcome could have on business and trade interests.\n\nDOING BUSINESS IN CHINA EXPLORE IN-DEPTH INVESTMENT AND BUSINESS GUIDES.

Our Online Business Guides offer explainer articles, news, useful tools, and videos from on-the-ground advisors who contribute to the Doing Business in China knowledge. Start exploring\n\nTrade policies\n\nTrade is arguably the most critical issue in the US\u2019s China policy agenda, with anti-China positions garnering bipartisan support. Both sides of the political aisle agree on the importance of reducing the trade deficit with China and decreasing reliance on Chinese imports. This consensus has led to the implementation of trade barriers during both the Trump and Biden administrations.\n\nPresident Trump initiated a trade war with China in 2018, imposing tariffs of up to 25 percent on a range of Chinese goods under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. President Biden has not only maintained these tariffs but also increased or introduced new duties on strategically important goods.\n\nDespite their shared stance on the necessity of reducing trade with China, the Trump and Harris agendas differ in their strategy for achieving bipartisan goals.\n\nTrump\u2019s China trade agenda\n\nTrump\u2019s agenda adopts a considerably broader, blanket approach to trade barriers compared to the more targeted strategy employed by the Biden administration. The central aim of his trade strategy is to bring back manufacturing jobs to the US that have been lost to overseas competitors \u2013 particularly China.\n\nIn his 2024 campaign materials, Trump has proposed universal baseline tariffs on most imported foreign goods, as well as a mechanism to gradually increase tariffs on countries that have been deemed to devalue their currency or engage in other unfair trading practices.\n\nWhile this policy does not explicitly target China, universal baseline taxes would be a major hit to Chinese exporters \u2013 particularly those selling consumer goods \u2013 as the US is an important export market for China. It would also considerably increase costs for American consumers and businesses. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has previously labeled China a currency manipulator, which means it is likely to become the target of the proposed counter-currency manipulation mechanism.\n\nTrump has also pledged to \u201cend reliance on China\u201d by adopting a range of trade barriers, of which the most extreme is revoking China\u2019s most-favored national (MFN) status. This proposal has received support from bipartisan bodies such as the US House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).\n\nRemoving China\u2019s MFN status \u2013 called Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) in the US \u2013 would allow the US to subject it to all manner of discriminatory and unilateral trade tariffs. This could include Trump\u2019s suggested 60 percent or higher blanket tariffs on Chinese goods. It would also lead to serious deterioration of US-China relations, and doubtlessly be met with litigation as both the US and China are WTO members.\n\nIt is as yet unclear whether Trump is serious in his intentions to take such a bold step, or whether it is simply election rhetoric. Such a move could significantly harm the US economy and the country\u2019s standing in global trade and diplomacy and would prove extremely unpopular among business groups. The decision would also be subject to a congressional vote, and could therefore require bipartisan support, which is currently not evident.\n\nBesides his musings to remove China\u2019s MFN status, Trump has pledged to adopt a four-year plan to \u201cphase out all Chinese imports of essential goods\u201d, including \u201ceverything from electronics to steel to pharmaceuticals\u201d. He has vowed to introduce rules that will prevent US companies from investing in China and vice versa, \u201callowing only those investments that serve American interests\u201d. He has also called for a ban on federal contracts for any company that outsources to China.\n\nFinally, a cornerstone of Trump\u2019s campaign agenda is the introduction of the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act to \u201cstop the flow of American jobs overseas\u201d. This Act would give the US president the authority to impose reciprocal tariffs on a country\u2019s goods if it imposes tariffs on US-made goods that are higher than those imposed by the US. While this Act does not explicitly mention China, Trump is clear about which countries the Act is designed for in one of his speeches: \u201cIf India, China, or any other country hits us with a 100 or 200 percent tariff on American-made goods, we will hit them with the same exact tariff.\u201d\n\nUS trade policy under Biden and Harris\n\nWhile the Biden administration has proved just as determined to curb trade with China as its predecessor, the incumbent president\u2019s approach has been more targeted.\n\nUnlike Trump, Biden has not proposed any blanket tariffs on Chinese goods, nor has he as yet voiced his opinion for (or against) the proposal to revoke China\u2019s MFN status.\n\nOn the other hand, as we have seen, Biden has not shied away from hardline tactics. The core difference is that Biden has sought to target certain strategic sectors, such as renewables, critical materials, semiconductors, and healthcare products, among others.\n\nIn May 2024, the Biden administration raised tariffs on 14 categories of imports from China. These included quadrupling the tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles (EVs) to 100 percent and doubling tariffs on goods such as semiconductors and solar cells to 50 percent.\n\nThese product categories have been chosen specifically because they serve to bolster Biden\u2019s \u201cInvesting in America agenda\u201d, which seeks to spur the growth of strategic industries in the US, such as EVs, renewable energy, and semiconductors. The additional tariffs on Chinese imports are the second half of the Investing in America agenda \u2013 providing subsidies and incentives to grow these industries on one side and protecting them by barring cheaper imports on the other.\n\nWhile Harris has yet to release a specific policy platform for her campaign, statements made in public appearances suggest she largely holds the same positions as the Biden administration on trade with China. In an interview on the CBS News program Face of the Nation, she stated that the US policy on China \u201cis not about decoupling, it is about de-risking\u201d, indicating support for decreasing reliance on China. She also said that the US needed to ensure it is \u201cprotecting American interests\u201d, echoing the positions of Biden\u2019s \u201cInvesting in America\u201d agenda.\n\nBiden\u2019s core campaign promise for 2025 before stepping down was to \u201cFinish the Job\u201d. This suggested that a second term would have seen further efforts to target Chinese industries deemed to undermine the US\u2019s domestic manufacturing efforts and national security concerns (in the case of critical materials). It is highly likely that Harris will build upon this policy platform, which could take the form of extending Trump-era tariffs, removing tariff exemptions or allowing them to expire, and further raising tariffs in more strategic sectors.\n\nThe Biden administration also vowed to take action against countries and importers that seek to circumvent the rules and avoid tariffs, something Trump has also called for. Biden also said he would work with Mexico to prevent China and other countries from evading tariffs by importing products through Mexico. It remains to be seen if Harris will continue with the same approach.\n\nTechnology, research, and national security\n\nScientific and technological development has become another key battleground in US-China relations under both the Trump and Biden administrations. Central to the conflict is the US\u2019s claim that China has gained an unfair advantage over competitors through practices such as forced technology transfer and corporate espionage, a view that is firmly held on both sides of the political aisle.\n\nChina\u2019s technological and scientific development is seen as a matter of national security, with anxiety surrounding the US\u2019s reliance on Chinese imports for critical technologies as well as China\u2019s military development. Both the Trump and Biden administrations imposed measures to guard against this alleged behavior and more broadly curb China\u2019s technological and military development.\n\nTrump and Biden have adopted different strategies for this policy. Trump, being more domestically focused, launched initiatives to curb collaboration with Chinese scientists and academics within the US and limit Chinese companies and individuals\u2019 investment in US land and infrastructure.\n\nMeanwhile, Biden has adopted a more outward-looking approach to curb China\u2019s technological advancement, imposing export restrictions on key technologies and putting pressure on allies to do the same. As is the case with trade policy, Harris is likely to adopt many of the Biden administration\u2019s strategies.\n\nTechnology and national security policy under Trump\n\nIn 2018, Trump launched the China Initiative as part of his national security strategy. This was a controversial counter-espionage measure targeting Chinese academics and researchers working in the US. The China Initiative allowed the US Department of Justice (DOJ) to investigate and prosecute \u201cnon-traditional collectors\u201d such as Chinese researchers in labs, universities, and defense bases that \u201care being coopted into transferring technology contrary to U.S. interests\u201d.\n\nThis initiative has become a clearly partisan issue. In 2022, the DOJ, under Biden, abandoned the China Initiative following criticism from civil rights groups that it racially profiled and discriminated against Asian Americans and \u201cfueled a narrative of intolerance and bias\u201d.\n\nSince then, House Republicans have sought to reinstate the China Initiative by inserting it in a House spending bill. However, it was later removed from the bill thanks to efforts by Democratic lawmakers.\n\nTrump has lambasted the DOJ\u2019s decision to shut down the program. Should he win the election, he has stated that \u201cefforts [to curtail China\u2019s ability to conduct espionage in the US] will be expanded in a very, very big way\u201d, and that the FBI and DOJ \u201cwill be hunting down Chinese spies\u201d. This suggests he may make further efforts to reintroduce the China Initiative or introduce a new but similar policy.\n\nIn addition to his counter-espionage policy proposals, Trump has pledged to enact \u201caggressive\u201d new regulations to limit Chinese ownership in vital infrastructure, such as energy, technology, medical supplies, and telecom, and to pressure Chinese companies to sell off holdings that \u201cthreaten the country\u2019s national and economic security\u201d.\n\nDuring his term, Trump added more than 300 Chinese companies to the \u201cEntity List\u201d, a blacklist that makes it almost impossible for American companies to sell to them. These include the major Chinese technology firms ZTE, SMIC, and Huawei.\n\nHe has also stated he will impose visa sanctions and travel restrictions \u201cto shut off Chinese access to American secrets\u201d. In May 2020, Trump suspended visas for Chinese graduate students who have ties to universities affiliated with the People\u2019s Liberation Army. Biden has upheld the suspension, and students were still being denied visas as recently as 2023.\n\nTechnology and national security policy under Biden\n\nThe Biden administration has arguably gone further than Trump in efforts to curb China\u2019s technological capabilities. One of the boldest moves taken against China during his term was the decision in October 2022 to implement sweeping export restrictions on advanced computing semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and supercomputing items to China.\n\nThe export restrictions aim to curb China\u2019s ability to \u201cobtain semiconductor manufacturing equipment essential to producing advanced integrated circuits needed for the next generation of advanced weapon systems, as well as high-end advanced computing semiconductors necessary to enable the development and production of technologies such as artificial intelligence used in military applications.\u201d\n\nIn addition to restricting technology exports to China, the US under Biden has also pressured its allies to do the same. In January 2023, Japan and the Netherlands announced their own export controls on semiconductor equipment to China, after striking a deal with the US.\n\nHis administration\u2019s decision in May 2024 to increase tariffs on Chinese goods was also based partly on the idea that it would \u201cencourage China to eliminate its unfair trade practices regarding technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, Biden has overseen the addition of more Chinese companies to the Entity List than under his predecessor, having added a total of 319 entities as of May 2024. Reasons for blacklisting the entities frequently include their alleged involvement in military technology and the provision of supplies to Russia.\n\nWhile neither Harris nor her campaign has yet provided insight into a potential national security strategy, all indicators suggest that a Harris administration would largely follow in the footsteps of Biden. In a 2019 primary debate, Harris alleged that China steals the US\u2019s intellectual property and dumps \u201csubstandard products into our economy\u201d. This suggests an affinity to Biden\u2019s protectionist policies on technology export and transfer.\n\nGeopolitics and diplomatic relations\n\nA victory for Trump or Harris would significantly influence US-China relations, each for distinct diplomatic reasons.\n\nUnder the Biden administration, US-China relations have seen a blend of confrontation and unilateral actions similar to Trump\u2019s tenure. Biden has maintained a tough stance on trade and territorial disputes, employing tariffs and continuing military activity in the South China Sea. However, he has also pursued diplomatic efforts to stabilize relations, engaging in high-level talks with China and establishing new communication channels. A potential second term for Trump would likely see a continuation of his confrontational rhetoric and unilateral actions against China. Trump\u2019s first term was marked by aggressive trade policies and criticism of China. However, his isolationist tendencies may reduce the US\u2019s global presence, potentially favoring China by weakening US\u2019s global alliances.\n\nDespite their differences, both leaders have shown a willingness to engage in diplomatic dialogue with China, albeit with varying degrees of volatility and flexibility.\n\nDiplomacy under a Harris presidency\n\nUnder a Harris presidency, US-China relations are poised to face continued challenges, influenced by complex geopolitical and domestic factors. Relations experienced significant strain in Biden\u2019s term due to issues such as China\u2019s support for Russia during the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the US\u2019s increasing engagement with Taiwan. A major flashpoint occurred on August 2, 2022, when then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, prompting a fierce response from China, including military exercises and the suspension of several bilateral dialogues.\n\nRelations further deteriorated when the US imposed technology export controls in October 2022, and upon the discovery of an alleged Chinese \u201cspy balloon\u201d in US airspace in February 2023. The latter incident led to the postponement of Secretary of State Antony Blinken\u2019s planned visit to China.\n\nDespite these setbacks, efforts to stabilize relations resumed in 2023. High-level diplomatic engagements included Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang\u2019s meeting with US Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns in May, emphasizing the need to prevent further deterioration. This was followed by significant bilateral dialogues, such as a two-day meeting between top Chinese diplomat Wang Yi and US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan in Vienna, and Blinken\u2019s visit to Beijing in June 2023.\n\nThe meeting between Biden and President Xi Jinping in San Francisco on November 15, 2023, at the APEC Summit, marked a crucial step in resetting the bilateral relationship. Both leaders underscored the importance of managing their countries\u2019 interactions, with Xi calling the US-China relationship \u201cthe most important bilateral relationship in the world.\u201d\n\nHarris has expressed support for continuing to cooperate with China during her term as Vice President. She had a \u201cbrief exchange\u201d with Xi Jinping at the sidelines of the 2022 APEC Summit in Bangkok, in which she stated that the two sides \u201cshould cooperate on global issues and keep communication channels open\u201d. In the 2023 interview with CBS News, which took place prior to the Xi-Biden meeting in San Francisco, Harris said that maintaining open lines of communication between the two sides was important for stability.\n\nNevertheless, US-China relations remain fraught with tension. The Biden administration has continued to apply pressure through trade tariffs and military cooperation with allies in the South China Sea.\n\nIn the CBS News interview, Harris stated that the two sides have \u201cvery serious disagreements\u201d with regard to the South China Sea. As Vice President, she has had an active role in the US\u2019s efforts to strengthen ties with allies in the Asia-Pacific, attending the US-ASEAN Summit in September 2023 and meeting with the President of the Philippines Ferdinand Marcos Jr. During this meeting, Harris reaffirmed the US\u2019s commitment to \u201cdefending the Philippines\u2019 sovereign rights and jurisdiction in the South China Sea\u201d, a position that is in direct conflict with China\u2019s interests in the region.\n\nMeanwhile, Biden\u2019s assertive stance on Taiwan continued to add to the friction. In May 2022, the State Department updated its fact sheet on Taiwan, omitting language that acknowledged the Chinese position of \u201cone China\u201d and the non-support for Taiwan independence, while still adhering to the one-China policy. During a May 2022 press conference in Tokyo, Biden stated a willingness to defend Taiwan militarily, a remark that was later clarified but nonetheless drew sharp reactions from China.\n\nIn April 2024, Biden signed a bill that included US$8 billion in military aid to Taiwan and some Asia-Pacific countries. Additionally, in a recent Time Magazine interview, he reiterated that the US would not rule out using military force to defend Taiwan, indicating a continued firm stance on the issue. Harris has also voiced support for the US\u2019s continued military assistance to Taiwan, while also calling for maintaining the status quo. In a 2022 speech, she stated that the US opposes \u201cany unilateral change to the status quo\u201d and that the US \u201cwill continue to support Taiwan\u2019s self-defense, consistent with our longstanding policy\u201d.\n\nDiplomacy under a second Trump term\n\nUnder a potential second Trump term, US-China relations could follow a contentious and unpredictable path, shaped by Trump\u2019s aggressive rhetoric and shifting diplomatic strategies.\n\nTrump\u2019s administration previously adopted a tough stance on China across various fronts. Besides his administration\u2019s trade war with China, Trump took a firm stance on China\u2019s territorial claims in the South China Sea, challenging Beijing\u2019s position and increasing US naval presence in the region.\n\nThroughout his first term, Trump consistently criticized China, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, which he often referred to as the \u201cChina virus\u201d. This rhetoric exacerbated tensions and contributed to a more confrontational relationship between the two countries.\n\nOn the other hand, it is possible that Trump will adopt a more isolationist approach in his second term, driven by pressure from within the Republican Party to reduce US overseas engagements. For instance, Trump has been a strong critic of NATO and has threatened to withdraw from the treaty, which would significantly weaken the West\u2019s global positioning. He has also opposed the foreign aid package and has previously refused to say whether he would defend Taiwan militarily while voicing skepticism over Taiwan\u2019s dominance in chip manufacturing and claiming that they \u201ctook our business away\u201d.\n\nThis could lead to a retreat from the international community, potentially reducing foreign military aid and diplomatic support for allies around the world, including Taiwan. Trump\u2019s less interventionist strategy might tilt the balance of power in China\u2019s favor in strategic regions like the Asia-Pacific.\n\nMoreover, despite Trump\u2019s volatile demeanor, he has demonstrated a willingness to engage in diplomatic dialogue with China and make concessions. For example, in June 2019, Trump relaxed the ban on US exports to Huawei. While Trump has praised President Xi personally, his policies towards China remain fluid and could shift based on diplomatic negotiations and domestic pressures.\n\nChina\u2019s view on the 2024 election\n\nChina finds itself in a precarious position with regard to the outcome of the US presidential election. Regardless of whether Harris or Trump secures a second term, China anticipates facing challenges due to the bipartisan anti-China sentiment prevalent in the US. Both candidates will face pressure to continue hardline policies towards China, maintaining a confrontational approach in various spheres.\n\nTo counter unilateral actions by the US, China has been fortifying its toolkit of measures, including counter-tariffs and export controls. In April 2024, China passed a new Tariff Law, formalizing rules for imposing anti-dumping and counter-tariffs on imports. Additionally, the Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law, passed in June 2021, empowers China to respond to foreign sanctions with its own counter-sanctions, affecting individuals and companies operating in the target country.\n\nChina has already demonstrated its readiness to impose countermeasures on the US. It has recently launched anti-dumping probes into chemical imports from the US, EU, Japan, and Taiwan, restricted exports of high-end technologies, and imposed export restrictions on key metals for chip production. These measures are widely seen as retaliatory responses to US actions.\n\nThe intent behind these actions is clear: China aims to safeguard its national interests and counter any attempts by the US to exert pressure through unilateral measures. By diversifying its toolkit and implementing targeted responses, China seeks to mitigate the impact of US policies on its economy and maintain its position in the global arena. However, the escalation of trade tensions and technological competition between the two countries underscores the fragility of the US-China relationship and the potential for further deterioration, regardless of the election outcome.\n\nBusiness impacts and policy considerations\n\nThe potential impact of the US election outcome on businesses ranges from increased supply chain disruptions and market volatility to more precarious investment climates and regulatory environments.\n\nUnder either administration, US-China relations will continue to be tense. Both parties share a desire to address the trade deficit and reduce reliance on China, suggesting that risks are relatively similar regardless of the election outcome. However, Trump\u2019s approach may carry a higher level of unpredictability, and his broader trade policies could potentially kick off another trade war. It nonetheless remains uncertain whether he will actually implement these plans were he to win.\n\nAt the same time, academic and research collaboration could face increasing challenges under either scenario, impacting innovation and knowledge-sharing. Further investment restrictions on China by the US could complicate business operations for US companies, potentially making doing business in China more challenging.\n\nSupply chain disruptions and market volatility are additional concerns for businesses, particularly in light of trade tariffs and potential countermeasures from China. Any escalation of military conflict in the Asia-Pacific region could exacerbate these disruptions, leading to significant disruption and market instability.\n\nThe overall investment climates and regulatory environments could also be affected, with American companies possibly getting caught in diplomatic firestorms between the two countries. However, it is worth noting that China has refrained from specifically targeting US companies thus far, and has strived to increase foreign investment and improve the business environment for foreign companies in general.\n\nA recent AmCham Business Climate Survey Report indicates that US-China relations are a major concern for American businesses, particularly those in the technology and R&D sectors. Despite this, the survey, which was conducted in 2023, indicated cautious optimism among some respondents, with approximately 30 percent anticipating improvements in bilateral relations in 2024. This reflects a slight shift in sentiment compared to previous years, suggesting that the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to engage with China may have improved the outlook among investors.\n\nIt is worth noting that the survey was conducted before Biden\u2019s tariff hikes, an act that could make companies more pessimistic about Biden\u2019s positions on China. Meanwhile, AmCham members also expressed the desire for the US government to moderate its rhetoric and engage in effective, high-level dialogues. A Trump win seems to run counter to this desire, given his penchant for heated rhetoric.\n\nUS companies should seek to further diversify their supply chains and factor further trade tensions into their business plans to mitigate the risk of disruptions. It will also be important to assess risk exposure in both markets, considering factors such as tariffs and export controls.\n\nPreparing for either outcome\n\nThe forthcoming US presidential election carries significant implications for trade policies, technological competition, and geopolitical dynamics between the two global powers. Regardless of the election outcome, the bipartisan consensus on China suggests that risks remain relatively consistent.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, stakeholders must remain vigilant and proactive in preparing for potential disruptions. Diversifying supply chains, assessing risk exposure in both markets and staying informed about policy developments are essential strategies for mitigating potential impacts on business operations.\n\nMoreover, ongoing analysis and adaptation are imperative in navigating the dynamic geopolitical environment. The nuances of US-China relations require continuous monitoring and adjustment of business strategies to align with shifting policies and market dynamics. This adaptability will be crucial for businesses to seize opportunities, mitigate risks, and maintain resilience amid evolving geopolitical tensions.\n\nThis article was first published on June 10, 2024, and last updated on August 23, 2024, to reflect the latest updates.",

        "text": "FDU Poll Finds Race and Gender Push Harris Above Trump Nationally\nRace and Gender Push Harris Above Trump Nationally\n\nRace considerations crater Trump support among non-white voters\n\nFairleigh Dickinson University, Madison, NJ, August 23, 2024 \u2013 Voters nationally give Vice President and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris an edge over former President Donald Trump in November\u2019s election by a seven-point margin (50 to 43), but race and gender remains central to the vote. When voters are made to think about the race or gender of the candidates, Harris\u2019 lead grows substantially; when they\u2019re not, support is essentially tied. Harris is also helped by strong support among the slightly less than half of men who reject traditionally masculine identities. Trump\u2019s strongest support is among men who hold traditionally masculine identities, while women and other men strongly favor Harris.\n\n\u201cTrump has built his political career around a very specific performance of whiteness and masculinity,\u201d said Dan Cassino, a professor of Government and Politics at Fairleigh Dickinson, and the Executive Director of the poll. \u201cIn the past, that\u2019s been seen as a strength, but it\u2019s no longer clear that it\u2019s working.\u201d\n\nIn the overall sample, Harris leads Trump 50 to 43 among likely voters, with 7 percent saying that they will support someone else in November\u2019s election (with undecided voters included, that lead is 47 to 40). Both Trump and Harris have the support of 95 percent of their partisans, and Harris leads Trump 38 to 33 among independents who do not lean towards either party. Similarly, Harris has a strong lead among self-identified liberals (87 to 10), progressives (93 to 5) and moderates (62 to 30). Trump leads among conservatives (76 to 19), and MAGA voters (95 to 4).\n\nTo examine the effect of race and gender on vote choice, an experiment was embedded in the survey.\n\nIn the survey, before being asked who they were supporting in the Presidential race, respondents were given a list of five issues, and asked which ones were important to their vote. The issues included Tax Policy, Immigration Policy, Climate Change, Abortion and Foreign Policy. But not all respondents got the same list. In addition to randomizing the order of the issues, one-third of respondents were given \u201cThe Race or Ethnicity of the Candidate\u201d as the last issue before the vote choice question, and one-third were given \u201cWhether the Candidate is a Man or a Woman\u201d as their last issue. The remaining one-third got all five of the issues, in no particular order.\n\nThis survey experiment means that we can compare the voters who were primed to think about race or sex with those who were not, and because the assignment to these conditions is done at random, we can be confident that any differences between the groups are a result of the priming, and not other factors. The effects are enormous.\n\nAmong voters who were not primed to think about the race or sex of the candidates, Harris and Trump are tied (47 to 48). When the list of issues mentions the sex of the candidates, Harris pulls ahead, 52 to 42. And when the race of the candidates is mentioned, Harris holds a 14-point lead, 53 to 39, a 15-point shift from the baseline condition.\n\n\u201cWhen voters are thinking about race or sex, Trump\u2019s support just plummets,\u201d said Cassino. \u201cAll the time, we hear strategists and pundits saying that Democratic candidates shouldn\u2019t talk about identity, but these results show that making race and sex salient to voters is bad for Trump and boosts Harris.\u201d\n\nThe movement in the race priming condition is largely due to changes in support among non-white voters. Fifty-five percent of non-white voters in the unprimed condition say that they\u2019ll support Harris, with 39 percent supporting Trump. But in the race primed condition, Trump\u2019s support among non-white voters drops by 10 points to 29 percent, while Harris\u2019s support rises by 10, from 55 to 65 percent. All told, mentioning the race of the candidates moves Harris\u2019s lead among non-white voters from 16 points (55 to 39) to 36 points (65 to 29).\n\nThis size of the effect is supplemented by a shift away from Trump among white voters in the race primed condition. In the unprimed condition, Trump leads Harris among white voters by 11 points, 53 to 42. In the race primed condition, the two are tied, with Harris marginally ahead among white voters, 47 to 44.\n\nThe largest shifts due to this priming condition appear to be among Black voters, but analysis of these effects is limited by the sample size of the survey.\n\n\u201cRace matters in elections, but it\u2019s not inevitable that voters are thinking about it,\u201d said Cassino. \u201cTrump does reasonably well among non-white voters so long as they\u2019re not thinking about race: once they are, we see a huge shift to Harris.\u201d\n\nMentioning the sex of the candidates also impacts vote choice, with the gender prime moving women\u2019s support away from Trump. Mentioning the sex of the candidates has no real effect on men\u2019s votes: it increases support for Harris by 5 points and reduces support for Trump by 2. But among women, mentioning the sex of the candidates drops Trump\u2019s support by 7, from 40 percent in the unprimed condition to 33 percent in the gender primed condition. The net effect is a change from women favoring Harris by 16 (56 to 40) in the unprimed condition, to favoring her by 26 (59 to 33) in the gender primed condition.\n\nThe gender dynamics of the race are also clear from a question asking respondents about how masculine or feminine they consider themselves to be. On this question, a little more than half of men say that they\u2019re \u201ccompletely masculine,\u201d and a little less than half describe themselves some other way (as \u201cmostly masculine,\u201d \u201cslightly masculine\u201d or in one of the feminine categories). The men who put themselves in the \u201ccompletely masculine\u201d category favor Trump over Harris by a wide margin, 64 to 30. All other men favor Harris by a 20-point margin, 55 to 35. Among women, \u201ccompletely feminine\u201d women are little different than other women: both favor Harris by about a 20-point margin. While there is a big difference between men and women overall, that difference is driven entirely by the men who say that they are \u201ccompletely masculine.\u201d Those men favor Trump; all other sex and gender groups favor Harris by about the same 20-point margin.\n\n\u201cWe talk about the gender gap in voting as being between men and women,\u201d said Cassino. \u201cBut it\u2019s not. The real gender gap is between men who are holding to traditionally masculine identities, and everybody else. Identity isn\u2019t just about race and sex: Trump\u2019s appeal to a traditional form of masculine identity is the only thing keeping this race close.\u201d\n\nMethodology\n\nThe survey was conducted between August 17 and August 20, 2024, using a voter list of registered voters nationwide carried out by Braun Research of Princeton, New Jersey. Respondents were contacted via either live caller telephone interviews, or text-to-web surveys sent to cellular phones, resulting in an overall sample of 801 registered voters nationally. 520 of the surveys were carried out via live caller telephone interviews to landlines (30%) and cellphones (70%) and the remainder (281) were done on a web platform via weblinks sent via SMS to cell phones. Surveys were conducted only in English.\n\nThe data were weighted to be representative of the population of voters in the 2020 US Presidential Election, according to data from AP VoteCast. The weights used, like all weights, balance the demographic characteristics of the sample to match known population parameters. The weighted results used here are balanced to match parameters for sex, age, education and race/ethnicity. Individuals were considered likely voters in the upcoming Presidential Election if they (a) were registered voters, who (b) said that they planned to vote in the upcoming election, and (c) had a candidate preference in that election.\n\nSPSSINC RAKE, an SPSS extension module that simultaneously balances the distributions of all variables using the GENLOG procedure, was used to produce final weights. Weights were trimmed to prevent individual interviews from having too much influence on the final results. The use of these weights in statistical analysis helps to ensure that the demographic characteristics of the sample approximate the demographic characteristics of the target population. The size of these weights is used to construct the measure of design effects, which indicate the extent to which the reported results are being driven by the weights applied to the data, rather than found in the data itself. Simply put, these design effects tell us how many additional respondents would have been needed to get the weighted number of respondents across weighted categories: larger design effects indicate greater levels of under-representation in the data. In this case, calculated design effects are approximately 1.3, largely driven by the weights used on the race/ethnicity variable.\n\nAll surveys are subject to sampling error, which is the expected probable difference between interviewing everyone in a population versus a scientific sampling drawn from that population. Sampling error should be adjusted to recognize the effect of weighting the data to better match the population. In this poll, the simple sampling error for 801 registered voters is +/-3.5 percentage points, at a 95 percent confidence interval. Including the design effects, the margin of error would be +/-4.6 percentage points, though the figure not including them is much more commonly reported.\n\nThis error calculation does not take into account other sources of variation inherent in public opinion studies, such as non-response, question wording, differences in translated forms, or context effects. While such errors are known to exist, they are often unquantifiable within a particular survey, and all efforts, such as randomization and extensive pre-testing of items, have been used to minimize them.\n\nThe FDU Poll is a member of the AAPOR Transparency Initiative and is devoted to ensuring that our results are presented in such a way that anyone can quickly and easily get all of the information that they may need to evaluate the validity of our surveys. We believe that transparency is the key to building trust in the work of high-quality public opinion research, and necessary to push our industry forward.\n\nWeighted Telephone Sample Characteristics\n\n801 Registered Voters Nationally\n\nFigures do not include individuals who declined to answer demographic items.\n\nMan\n\n48% N = 380\n\nWoman\n\n52% N = 412\n\nSome Other Way\n\n>1% N = 7\n\n18-30\n\n17% N = 136\n\n31-44\n\n23% N = 184\n\n45-64\n\n38% N = 304\n\n65+\n\n22% N = 176\n\nWhite\n\n67% N = 526\n\nBlack\n\n13% N = 102\n\nHispanic/Latino/a\n\n13% N = 102\n\nAsian\n\n4% N = 31\n\nOther/Multi-racial\n\n3% N = 24\n\nNo college degree\n\n59% N = 468\n\nCollege degree or more\n\n41% N = 326\n\nQuestion Wording and Order\n\nFirst off, we\u2019d like to ask you a few questions about the upcoming Presidential Election\n\nP1.

The same group has also attempted email phishing attacks targeting people connected with Trump, Biden, and Vice President Kamala Harris, Microsoft and Google have said in recent weeks.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMeta said it has not seen evidence the targeted WhatsApp accounts were successfully compromised, but said it has shared information with law enforcement and other tech companies.\n\nOn Monday, the U.S. government said Iran has been trying to hack both the Republican and Democratic presidential campaigns as part of efforts to shape the outcome of November\u2019s vote.\n\n\u201cIran perceives this year\u2019s elections to be particularly consequential in terms of the impact they could have on its national security interests, increasing Tehran\u2019s inclination to try to shape the outcome,\u201d the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the FBI, and the federal cybersecurity agency CISA wrote in a joint statement. \u201cWe have observed increasingly aggressive Iranian activity during this election cycle, specifically involving influence operations targeting the American public and cyber operations targeting Presidential campaigns.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign has blamed the leak of internal documents to news outlets on Iran, which the FBI is investigating. The Harris campaign says it was warned by the FBI in July that it had been targeted by a foreign influence operation but is not aware of any security breaches.\n\nMeta said the hackers on WhatsApp pretended to be technical support for AOL, Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft. Using an approach known as social engineering, they tried to trick targets into revealing sensitive information, such as account passwords. The company identified the campaign after some of the targets reported suspicious messages to WhatsApp.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe hackers also targeted \u201cpolitical and diplomatic officials, business and other public figures\u201d in Israel, Palestine, Iran, the U.S., and the U.K., Meta said.\n\nThe group is well-known for using phishing and other attacks to compromise targets, including those perceived as Iran\u2019s political enemies, dissidents, human rights activists, and journalists.",

        "text": "U.S. Presidential Election 2024: In Chicago, Democrats keep the faith\nOn the sidelines of the Democratic National Convention, which ended August 22 in Chicago, Democrats are not just praying for Kamala Harris to win the presidential election\u2014they're trying to convert the faithful into voters.\n\nAt the convention, sessions begin and end with an ecumenical prayer. However, elsewhere in the city, at the \u201cDemPalooza\u201d exhibition, religious groups are working hard to attract potential voters. This isn't about religious proselytism; it's about encouraging the faithful to vote.\n\nThe United States is a predominantly Christian country, and the white religious population tends to lean conservative.\n\nFurther reading: 2024 U.S. Election: 'Providence' plays unprecedented role in the campaign trail\n\nHowever, Patrick Carolan, founder of the group \u201cCatholics Vote for Common Good,\u201d noted that the percentage of white Catholics who voted for Donald Trump dropped from 65% in 2016 to 50% in 2020, and he intends to seize this opportunity.\n\nHis organization, active particularly in the six or seven swing states that will decide the election, preaches that \u201cbeing Catholic is not limited to abortion\u201d and that Catholic voters should prioritize the quality of a candidate rather than just this one issue. \u201cWe're trying to convince them that they won't go to hell if they vote Democrat,\u201d Patrick Carolan quips.\n\n\"Demonization\"\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Council of Muslim Organizations Candidate Action Network is busy promoting its initiative to register one million new Muslim voters.\n\nVolunteer Ayoub Razick emphasized that this effort is aimed at reversing the trend of political disengagement observed since the September 11, 2001 attacks, which was driven by suspicions against the Muslim community.\n\n\u201cThis type of demonization continues even today, but things have improved, right?\u201d Razick said. \u201cWe're no longer in 2016; it's 2024, and we're trying to organize the Muslim vote, to increase Muslim participation in this election and in future elections,\u201d he added.\n\nNearby, the Center for Freethought Equality, an organization that advocates for freethinkers, is promoting its efforts to elect officials who will protect the rights of atheists.\n\nA 2023 study by the Public Religion Research Institute showed that church attendance is declining in the United States, with a third of respondents stating that religion is not important to them. \u201cWe want to ensure that elected officials do not seek to turn the prescriptions of a particular religion into law, as Christian nationalists are trying to do,\u201d explained Howard Katz, the organization's president.\n\n\"Walk humbly\"\n\nIt isn't easy to get elected in the United States without at least paying lip service to the importance of religion. However, according to Katz, the idea that one cannot hold public office without identifying as religious \u201cis fading.\u201d\n\nThis hasn't stopped the Democrats from showcasing their faith in Chicago. The star of the week, Kamala Harris, is a Baptist Protestant who often speaks publicly about religious teachings. At the same time, her running mate, Tim Walz, readily identifies as a Lutheran (a Protestant denomination) from Minnesota.\n\nOn the convention stage, prominent Democrats, from South Carolina Congressman Jim Clyburn to Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear and Georgia Senator\u2014and Baptist pastor\u2014Raphael Warnock\u2014referenced biblical scriptures.\n\nDonald Trump has excelled at winning and maintaining the support of religious groups, particularly evangelicals, without being a practicing religious person himself.\n\nThe former president and Republican candidate has also been accused of sometimes indulging in exaggerated acts of religiosity, such as in 2020 when he held up a Bible in front of a church near the White House after a protest was dispersed by law enforcement.\n\n\u201cI saw him hold the Bible and promote it. As if it needed that,\u201d Warnock remarked in Chicago. \u201cThe book says, 'Do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly with your God.' He should try reading it.\u201d",

        "text": "RFK Jr. endorses Trump and suspends presidential campaign\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. suspended his independent presidential campaign and threw his support behind GOP nominee Donald Trump on Friday, saying in remarks in Phoenix that he was endorsing the former president because he saw no viable path to the White House.\n\n\"In my heart, I no longer believe that I have a realistic path to electoral victory,\" Kennedy said. \"I cannot in good conscience ask my staff and volunteers to keep working their long hours or ask my donors to keep giving when I cannot honestly tell them that I have a real path to the White House.\"\n\nKennedy said three issues convinced him to leave the Democratic Party and \"to throw my support to President Trump\": free speech, the war in Ukraine and what he called the \"war on our children.\"\n\n\"My joining the Trump campaign will be a difficult sacrifice for my wife and children, but worthwhile if there's even a small chance of saving these kids,\" he said. He said processed foods, chemicals and obesity were destroying the health of children in the U.S.\n\nKennedy later appeared at a rally with Trump in Glendale, Arizona. Trump said Kennedy would \"have a huge influence on this campaign.\"\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. makes an announcement on the future of his campaign in Phoenix, Arizona, on Aug. 23, 2024. Thomas Machowicz / REUTERS\n\nThe son of Robert F. Kennedy and the nephew of President John F. Kennedy, RFK Jr.'s announcement was met with condemnation by other members of the storied political family. His sister Kerry Kennedy said in a statement on behalf of herself and four other family members that his decision to endorse Trump was \"a betrayal of the values that our father and our family hold most dear\" and \"a sad ending to a sad story.\"\n\nHis wife, the actress Cheryl Hines, thanked volunteers for their work on the campaign, saying they \"accomplished feats that were said to be impossible.\"\n\nBut Kennedy acknowledged Friday that his wife wasn't pleased with his decision. \"I am so grateful to my amazing wife Cheryl for her unconditional love, as I made a political decision with which she is very uncomfortable. I wish this also for the country \u2014 love and unity even in the face of disagreement. We will need that in coming times,\" Kennedy tweeted.\n\nKennedy also said he wasn't \"terminating\" his campaign, merely suspending it, and he would remain on the ballot in many noncompetitive states. \"In about 10 battleground states where my presence would be a spoiler, I'm going to remove my name, and I've already started the process,\" he said, adding that people in red states and blue states could vote for him \"without harming or helping President Trump or Vice President Harris.\"\n\nAnd he held out the distant possibility that if neither Trump nor Harris were able to win 270 electoral votes, tying 269 to 269, \"I could conceivably still end up in the White House in a contingent election.\"\n\nAt his Glendale rally, Trump vowed, if elected, to establish an independent presidential commission on assassination attempts that would be tasked with releasing all of the remaining documents related to JFK's assassination. He also said that he'd establish a panel to investigate chronic health problems and childhood diseases.\n\n\"All who supported Bobby's campaign, I very simply ask you join us in building this coalition \u2014 it's a beautiful coalition \u2014 in defense of liberty and safety, prosperity and peace,\" Trump said.\n\nKennedy's campaign\n\nKennedy's campaign had been seeking ballot access in states including Arizona as recently as this week, although he filed paperwork Thursday evening to withdraw his candidacy in the battleground state \u2014 a foreshadowing of his announcement. When he suspended his campaign, he was on the ballot in over 23 states and awaiting confirmation in another 22.\n\nBefore his speech, he disclosed that he was ending his candidacy in a court filing in Pennsylvania and said he and running mate Nicole Shanahan were seeking to withdraw their petition to appear on Pennsylvania's presidential ballot.\n\nHe will be on the ballot in the battleground state of Michigan, however.\n\n\"He cannot withdraw at this point,\" a spokesperson from Michigan's office of the secretary of state. \"His name will remain on the ballot.\"\n\nIn his remarks, Kennedy claimed that \"in an honest system, I believe that I would have won the election.\"\n\nHe blasted the Democratic Party \u2014 his former party and that of his father and uncle \u2014 saying that it has become \"the party of war, censorship, corruption, big pharma, big tech, big tech, big ag and big money.\"\n\nKennedy thanked his staffers for their tireless work these months.\n\n\"You carried me off that glass mountain,\" he said.\n\nKennedy originally entered the race as a Democrat, challenging President Biden for the nomination, before deciding last October to run as an independent. Kennedy is a bestselling author and was an environmental lawyer who worked on issues such as clean water.\n\nJen O'Malley Dillon, the chair of Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign, appealed to Kennedy's supporters in a statement after his announcement Friday.\n\n\"For any American out there who is tired of Donald Trump and looking for a new way forward, ours is a campaign for you,\" she said. \"In order to deliver for working people and those who feel left behind, we need a leader who will fight for you, not just for themselves, and bring us together, not tear us apart. Vice President Harris wants to earn your support.\"\n\nIn one of the more surprising revelations during his campaign, Kennedy also admitted that he had put a dead bear cub in New York City's Central Park nearly 10 years ago.\n\nNo poll has shown Kennedy with enough support to defeat either Trump and Harris nationally or in any state, but polls during his campaign suggested he might attract enough support to make a difference in some of the battleground states where the margins of victory were thin in 2020 and 2016.\n\nKennedy, one of 11 children, lost both his uncle and father to assassinations. He received Secret Service protection last month after the assassination attempt on Trump in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn recent years, Kennedy has promoted anti-vaccine conspiracy theories and was shunned by several members of his family who earlier this year endorsed Mr. Biden.\n\nand contributed to this report.",

        "text": "August 23, 2024, presidential campaign news\nVice President Kamala Harris speaks at the Democratic National Convention on August 22. Bernadette Tuazon/CNN\n\nVice President Kamala Harris capped one of the most extraordinary months in modern political history Thursday night with a speech that rallied Democrats and cast Donald Trump as the enemy of classic American principles.\n\nHarris went directly at her Republican rival, offering a clean break from the uncertainty and upheaval during his years in the White House. She laid out the former president\u2019s legal troubles. She blamed him for the horrors some women have faced amid the implementation of strict state-level abortion laws.\n\nHere are the takeaways from the fourth night of the DNC:\n\nFight for \u201cfreedom\u201d and a question of government interference: Harris has talked at great length about \u201cfreedom,\u201d seeking to reframe issues such as reproductive rights as a question of government interference.\n\nHarris gets personal: The vice president didn\u2019t explicitly compare her upbringing with the former president\u2019s, but other speakers this week have made a more direct contrast between her childhood and Trump\u2019s life as the son of a real estate mogul.\n\nAllies back up Harris\u2019 resume: Each night, speakers have highlighted her work fighting transnational gangs, sexual abusers and corporate bad actors.\n\nMeet the Harris clan: Trump and many other Republicans for years have made a show out of mispronouncing Harris\u2019 first name. On Thursday night, Harris\u2019 two young grandnieces appeared onstage with actress Kerry Washington to send a message: It\u2019s so easy that children can do it. Harris\u2019 niece, Meena Harris, appeared with Harris\u2019 stepdaughter, Ella Emhoff and her goddaughter, Helena Hudlin. Later, Maya Harris, the vice president\u2019s sister, talked about their mother, who died in 2009.\n\nGun violence testimonies: The convention highlighted the personal stories of people affected by gun violence. Speakers shared their experiences of loss, including Georgia Rep. Lucy McBath whose son was murdered in 2012; mothers who lost their children in the mass shootings at the Sandy Hook and Uvalde school shootings; Melody McFadden, who lost her mother to domestic violence; and Edgar Vilchez, who lost a classmate. Former Arizona Rep. Gabby Giffords, who survived a shooting at a campaign event in 2011, closed out the segment.\n\n\u2018Central Park Five\u2019 member: Trump has a long history of weaponizing racial resentments for political gain, but the first instance of Trump utilizing that brand of politics was when the \u201cCentral Park Five\u201d \u2014 five Black and Latino teenage boys \u2014 were wrongfully arrested in 1989 and eventually convicted of raping and assaulting a woman jogging in New York City. Trump, then a New York real estate developer, took out and signed full-page newspaper ads calling for the boys to be executed. Those boys were later exonerated. On Thursday night, four of the five appeared on stage at the DNC.\n\nGaza war opponents denied speaking spot: The DNC denied speaking time to \u201cUncommitted\u201d delegates elected by primary protest votes against the Biden administration\u2019s Israel policy. Harris pledged to support and defend Israel and condemned the atrocities of Hamas\u2019 October 7 attacks. She then said \u201cwhat has happened in Gaza over the last 10 months is devastating. So many innocent lives lost. Desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety over and over again.\u201d\n\nCelebrities make their mark: The DNC has seen several stars this week, from Lil Jon\u2019s surprise appearance during the star-studded roll call to Oprah Winfrey\u2019s speech Wednesday. Mindy Kaling, Tony Goldwyn, Stevie Wonder, John Legend, Sheila E. Pink, Mickey Guyton, Maren Morris and Jason Isbell also got stage time.",

        "text": "RFK Jr. suspends presidential campaign, endorses Trump\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., an independent U.S. presidential candidate with a famous political pedigree but whose bid was overshadowed by a brain worm and a dead bear, has announced the suspension of his campaign, endorsing the Republican Party's nominee, former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"In my heart, I no longer believe I have a realistic path to an electoral victory,\" Kennedy told a group of reporters and supporters in Phoenix. \"I am not terminating my campaign. I am simply suspending it,\" he added, explaining he did not want to help Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party nominee.\n\nIn 10 states where he could be a spoiler, Kennedy said he would have his name removed, but it would stay on the ballot in others where he said supporters could safely vote for him without risk of aiding the Democrats.\n\nKennedy on Thursday filed paperwork withdrawing from the ballot in Arizona, one of the swing states likely to determine the outcome of November's presidential election.\n\n\"My joining the Trump campaign will be a difficult sacrifice,\" Kennedy said in Phoenix, adding it would be worthwhile if he gets a chance in a Republican administration to end what he contends is a wave of chronic diseases among America's children.\n\n\"In an honest system, I believe I would have won the election,\" said Kennedy, alleging that the mainstream media censored him while the Democratic Party thwarted his access to the ballot in numerous states.\n\nHe said Trump's promise to negotiate an end to Russia's war on Ukraine \"alone would justify my support for his campaign.\"\n\nKennedy stepped off the podium after 50 minutes, taking no questions.\n\nHe appeared later in the day at a Trump rally in neighboring Glendale.\n\n\"For the past 16 months, Bobby has run an extraordinary campaign for president of the United States,\" said Trump. \"I know because he also went after me a couple of times.\"\n\nFamous name\n\nA 70-year-old environmental lawyer, Kennedy labeled himself a political outsider despite his lineage. He entered the presidential race as a longshot Democratic Party candidate before dropping that bid last October and announcing he would mount an independent campaign.\n\nWith a surname almost synonymous with the Democratic Party (he is the nephew of President John. F. Kennedy and son of former U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, both of whom were assassinated in the 1960s), RFK Jr. began his campaign polling in the low double digits in some states.\n\nTrump, at Friday evening\u2019s political event, said if he gets back in the White House, he will appoint an independent commission on assassination attempts and release all government documents related to the 1963 assassination of President Kennedy.\n\nSiblings of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are decrying their brother\u2019s endorsement of Trump.\n\nOur brother Bobby\u2019s decision to endorse Trump today is a betrayal of the values that our father and our family hold most dear. It is a sad end to a sad story,\" Kerry Kennedy wrote in a statement along with three of her sisters and two of her brothers.\n\nThe extended Kennedy family had earlier expressed embarrassment and denounced their relative's campaign after he dropped out of the Democratic Party, choosing instead to support the reelection of President Joe Biden, who dropped out of the race and was replaced by Harris last month.\n\nThe shakeup in the Democrats' lineup further eroded support for Kennedy, who had benefited from those unenthused about a rematch of the 2020 election between Biden and Trump.\n\n\"The more voters learned about RFK Jr. the less they liked him. Donald Trump isn't earning an endorsement that's going to help build support, he's inheriting the baggage of a failed fringe candidate. Good riddance,\" said Democratic National Committee senior adviser Mary Beth Cahill in a statement following Kennedy's announcement.\n\nFringe appeal\n\nKennedy, labeled a conspiracy theorist by his critics, appealed to some anti-establishment voters attracted by his contrarian foreign policy and long-standing campaign against vaccines. But he faced mainstream disdain and even ridicule.\n\nIn May, Kennedy said a \"brain fog\" he suffered a decade ago was caused by a parasitic worm that had eaten part of his brain.\n\nKennedy more recently was the target of late-night TV comedians and social media satire after he revealed that he had dumped a dead bear cub in New York City's Central Park in 2014 as a prank.\n\nA magazine article in July alleged Kennedy had molested a family babysitter decades ago. Asked about the allegation on a podcast, he said he was \"not a church boy\" and had \"many skeletons\" in his closet.\n\n\"Third-party candidates often lose steam as the election approaches, but Kennedy's trajectory has been particularly ignominious,\" said Nate Silver, a statistician and prominent election forecaster, in a Substack posting on Thursday.\n\n\"In three-way polls against Biden and Trump, he initially polled at 10 or 11 percent, then gradually faded to 8 (save for a bounce just after Biden's awful debate). In the Trump-Harris matchup, though, he's dropped to about 4 percent.\"\n\nTrump has offered to \"enlist\" him in a second administration, Kennedy said on Friday.\n\nTrump, the previous day, acknowledged he had spoken with Kennedy several times but not recently.\n\nTrump told CNN Tuesday that he would \"be open\" to Kennedy playing a part in his administration if Kennedy dropped his presidential bid and endorsed the Republican nominee.\n\nKennedy's running mate, Nicole Shanahan, suggested in an interview Tuesday that Kennedy would do \"an incredible job\" as the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nKennedy has claimed that agencies under HHS, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health, have been captured by corporate interests, making them predators on the American public.\n\n\"I love the idea of giving him some sort of role in some sort of major three-letter entity or whatever it may be and let him blow it up,\" the Republican nominee's son, Donald Trump Jr., told a conservative radio talk show on Wednesday.\n\n'Spoiler' for MAGA?\n\nDemocratic National Committee adviser Ramsey Reid argued in a memo released Friday that Kennedy\u2019s role from the beginning had been to serve as a \"spoiler\" who would help Trump by drawing votes away from the Democratic candidate.\n\n\"He was recruited into the race by MAGA Republicans like Steve Bannon, his candidacy was propped up by Trump's largest donor, and he parroted MAGA attacks on President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris,\" Reid said.\n\nOn Thursday, at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, some delegates looked forward to Kennedy\u2019s withdrawal from the race.\n\nMontana delegate Mary Jo O'Rourke, whose father worked for RFK Jr.'s father in the Justice Department, told VOA she is a devotee of the Kennedy family, but it is time for the former Democrat \"to go home and enjoy the rest of his life.\"\n\nKennedy had initially been viewed as siphoning more votes from Biden than Trump, but recent polls indicated he was appearing to attract more voters who would otherwise be inclined to cast a ballot for the Republican nominee.\n\nOf those who supported Kennedy in July, 4 in 10 shifted to Harris (compared with 2 in 10 who switched to Trump), according to Pew Research Center polling released last week.\n\nMost voters, as the election day approaches, \"go back to their parties. They're not looking for an independent candidate. They're looking to vote for one of the two likely winners,\" John Fortier, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, told VOA.\n\nIn a tight election in the half dozen or so swing states that will tip the balance of the electoral vote count, the presence or absence of a third party or independent candidate on the ballot could determine the overall outcome.\n\nThe victor of the U.S. presidential race must win 270 electoral votes, with each state's allocation equal to the number of senators and representatives it has in the Congress. It is possible for a candidate to receive the most total votes but lose the electoral vote count and thus the presidency.\n\nKennedy told reporters on Friday he could still win if the Electoral College vote for Trump and Harris ends up tied at 269. In that case, members of the new Congress would select the president in early January.\n\nKim Lewis, Katherine Gypson in Chicago and Carolyn Presutti in Phoenix contributed to this story.",

See key dates for debates, Election Day voting\nThe Democratic National Convention has come to a wrap, meaning the presidential candidates for both the Republican and Democratic parties are now secured for the 2024 United States Presidential Election\n\nAfter withdrawing his candidacy in late July, 81-year-old President Joe Biden formally passed the torch to Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic candidate during this week's convention. She accepted her nomination officially during the last night of the convention with an emotional acceptance speech.\n\nDuring the first night of the Republican National Convention, which took place July 15-19, Former President Donald Trump officially secured his nomination with a roll-call vote and announced Senator JD Vance of Ohio as his running mate.\n\nWith less than three months remaining until the November election, a presidential debate between Harris and Trump will mark the start of the final phase of the campaign season.\n\nWhen is the next presidential debate 2024?\n\nThe next presidential debate is approaching quickly, and it will be the first-ever time Harris and Trump face off \u2014 and may be the only time they debate one another.\n\nABC News is hosting the second presidential debate on Sept. 10 at 8 p.m. Central Time in Philadelphia.\n\nTrump has proposed two additional debates, with Fox News on Sept. 4 and NBC News on Sept. 25, but the Harris campaign has not yet agreed, CBS News reported.\n\nIn late June, CNN hosted the first presidential debate in Atlanta, where Trump faced Biden, who was largely criticized for his performance and inability to speak clearly.\n\nWho will moderate the 2024 presidential debate?\n\n\"World News Tonight\" anchor David Muir and ABC News Live \"Prime\" anchor Linsey Davis will moderate the debate, according to ABC News.\n\nWhen is the vice presidential debate 2024?\n\nThe vice presidential debate is set as Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Ohio Sen. JD Vance gear up to take the stage after both accepted an invitation from CBS News.\n\nThe outlet confirmed inviting both candidates to debate in New York on Sept. 17, Sept. 24, Oct. 1 and Oct. 8. Walz posted on X that he agreed to debate, writing, \"See you on October 1, JD.\"\n\nKey dates for the 2024 presidential election\n\nVoters across the U.S. will start showing up to the polls as early as next month, when Pennsylvania kicks off early voting on Sept. 16.

They're generally voting against the candidate they hate the most.\n\n\"And that's no way for a democracy to function.\"\n\nMs Stein calls for an \"economic bill of rights\" that would include universal access to healthcare and a right to employment. She also vows to fight climate change, defend abortion access and transgender rights, and was recently arrested at a student protest on behalf of Gaza.\n\nShe is unlikely to get more than 2% of the vote - but that could still play spoiler to Ms Harris. Hillary Clinton supporters partly blame her for the Democrat's narrow defeat in 2016. In three critical states, Mrs Clinton lost to Mr Trump by fewer votes than Ms Stein received.\n\nDuring this election cycle, Ms Stein has accused Democrats of trying \"to sue us off multiple state ballots\" to cheat and \"change the rules to maintain their grip on power\".\n\nAccording to the party's website, Ms Stein will be on the ballot in at least four states, though her campaign is working to be added to more states. Butch Ware, a professor at the University of California Santa Barbara, is her running-mate.",

        "text": "Robert F Kennedy Jr suspends US presidential campaign and backs Donald Trump\nIndependent US presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr has announced he will suspend his election campaign and throw his support behind Republican candidate Donald Trump.\n\nThe 70-year-old reportedly filed paperwork on Thursday to remove his name from the ballot in 10 battleground states, but said he would remain a candidate in other states that were unlikely to sway the outcome of the election.\n\n\"I no longer believe that I have a realistic path to electoral victory,\" he said at an address in Phoenix on Friday, local time.\n\nRFK Junior says he has 'skeletons in my closet' after sexual assault allegation Photo shows A close up of RFK Jr's face Independent US presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr says he has \"so many skeletons in my closet,\" following an allegation that he sexually assaulted a former family babysitter.\n\nMr Kennedy said he had met with Trump and his aides several times and learned they agreed on issues including border security, free speech and ending wars.\n\n\"There are still many issues and approaches on which we continue to have very serious differences but we are aligned on other key issues,\" he said at an address in Phoenix.\n\n\"I've made the heart-wrenching decision to suspend my campaign and to support President Trump,\" he added.\n\n\"This decision is agonising for me because of the difficulties it causes my wife and my children and my friends, but I have the certainty that this is what \u2026 [I'm] meant to do.\"\n\nTrump celebrated Mr Kennedy's endorsement at a campaign stop in Las Vegas.\n\n\"I want to thank Bobby. That was very nice,\" he said.\n\n\"He's a great guy, respected by everybody.\"\n\nHis announcement came after support for him in national polls plunged to about 5 per cent and his campaign funds began to run low.\n\nAn environmental lawyer, anti-vaccine activist and son and nephew of two titans of Democratic politics who were assassinated during the turbulent 1960s, Mr Kennedy entered the race in April 2023 as a challenger to President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination.\n\nRFK Jr. (left) joined Donald Trump on stage at a Republican campaign rally on Friday, following the announcement. (AP: Ross D. Franklin)\n\nWith voters at the time turned off by both the aging Mr Biden and the legally embattled Trump, interest in Mr Kennedy soared.\n\nHe shifted his plans and decided to run as an independent, and a November 2023 Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Mr Kennedy drawing the support of 20 per cent of Americans in a three-way race with Mr Biden and Trump.\n\nHe ran a high-profile advertisement during the February 2024 Super Bowl that invoked his father, former US senator Robert F Kennedy, and uncle, former US president John F Kennedy, and drew outrage from much of his high-profile family.\n\nFor a time, both the Biden and Trump campaigns showed signs they were worried that Mr Kennedy could draw enough support to change the election outcome.\n\nMr Kennedy built an unusually strong base for a third-party bid, fuelled in part by anti-establishment voters and vaccine septics who had followed his anti-vaccine work since the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBut as the race changed quickly in the last two months \u2014 with Trump surviving an assassination attempt and 81-year-old Mr Biden bowing to pressure from his own party and passing the campaign torch to Harris \u2014 voter interest in Mr Kennedy waned.\n\nDemocrats have shrugged off his announcement.\n\n\"Donald Trump isn't earning an endorsement that's going to help build support, he's inheriting the baggage of a failed fringe candidate. Good riddance,\" Democratic National Committee senior adviser Mary Beth Cahill said in a statement.\n\nKennedy family responds\n\nKerry Kennedy (right) and other members of the Kennedy family support Joe Biden at a Democratic campaign event in April. (Reuters: Elizabeth Frantz)\n\nA year ago, some would have thought it inconceivable that a member of arguably the most storied family in Democratic politics would work with Trump to keep a Democrat out of the White House.\n\nEven in recent months, Mr Kennedy has accused Trump of betraying his followers, while Trump has criticised him as \"the most radical left candidate in the race\".\n\nFive members of the Kennedy family issued a statement on Friday calling his support for Trump \"a sad ending to a sad story\".\n\n\"We want an America filled with hope and bound together by a shared vision of a brighter future, a future defined by individual freedom, economic promise and national pride,\" read the statement, posted by his sister Kerry Kennedy on X.\n\n\"We believe in Harris and Walz. Our brother Bobby's decision to endorse Trump today is a betrayal of the values that our father and our family hold most dear.\"\n\nTrump mega-donor Timothy Mellon, an 82-year-old banking heir, has given millions of dollars this election cycle to support Mr Kennedy, and $US75 million ($110 million) to support Trump, according to Federal Election Commission filings through to July 31.\n\nABC/wires",

Kamil Krzaczynski/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\"I know there are people of various political views watching tonight, and I want you to know, I promise to be a president for all Americans,\" Harris said. \"You can always trust me to put country above party and self, to hold sacred America's fundamental principles, from the rule of law to free and fair elections, to the peaceful transfer of power.\"\n\nThroughout her nearly hour-long remarks, Harris took aim at former President Donald Trump and presented her top policies for a Harris-Walz White House.\n\nRead Harris' full remarks at the DNC below\n\nTo my husband, Doug, thank you for being an incredible partner to me and father to Cole and Ella. And happy anniversary. I love you so very much.\n\nTo Joe Biden -- Mr. President. When I think about the path we have traveled together, I am filled with gratitude. Your record is extraordinary, as history will show. And your character is inspiring. Doug and I love you and Jill. And I am forever thankful to you both.\n\nAnd to Coach Tim Walz, you are going to be an incredible Vice President. And to the delegates and everyone who has put your faith in our campaign -- your support is humbling.\n\nAmerica, the path that led me here in recent weeks, was no doubt... unexpected. But I'm no stranger to unlikely journeys.\n\nMy mother Shyamala Harris had one of her own. I miss her every day, especially now and I know she's looking down tonight and smiling. My mother was 19 when she crossed the world alone, traveling from India to California with an unshakeable dream to be the scientist who would cure breast cancer. When she finished school, she was supposed to return home to a traditional arranged marriage. But, as fate would have it, she met my father, Donald Harris -- a student from Jamaica -- they fell in love and got married.\n\nAnd that act of self-determination made my sister Maya and me. Growing up, we moved a lot. I will always remember that big Mayflower truck, packed with all our belongings. Ready to go to Illinois, to Wisconsin and wherever our parents' jobs took us. My early memories of my parents together are joyful ones.\n\nA home filled with laughter and music Aretha, Coltrane and Miles.\n\nAt the park, my mother would tell us to stay close, but my father would just smile, and say, \"Run, Kamala Run\" \"Don't be afraid\" \"Don't let anything stop you.\" From my earliest years, he taught me to be fearless. But the harmony between my parents did not last. When I was in elementary school, they split up and it was mostly my mother who raised us. Before she could finally afford to buy a home, she rented a small apartment in the East Bay. In the Bay, you either live in the hills or the flatlands. We, lived in the flats. A beautiful working-class neighborhood of firefighters, nurses and construction workers -- all who tended their lawns with pride.\n\nMy mother worked long hours and like many working parents, she leaned on a trusted circle to help raise us. Mrs. Shelton, who ran the daycare below us and became a second mother. Uncle Sherman, Aunt Mary, Uncle Freddy and Auntie Chris. None of them family by blood. And all of them family by love. Family who taught us How to make gumbo. How to play chess. And sometimes even let us win. Family who loved us. Believed in us. And told us we could be anything. Do anything.\n\nThey instilled in us the values they personified, community, faith and the importance of treating others as you would want to be treated.\n\nWith kindness, respect and compassion, my mother was a brilliant, five-foot-tall, brown woman with an accent. And, as the eldest child, I saw how the world would sometimes treat her -- but she never lost her cool. She was tough. Courageous.\n\nA trailblazer in the fight for women's health. And she taught Maya and me a lesson that Michelle mentioned the other night. She taught us to never complain about injustice but do something about it. She Also taught us -- never do anything half-assed. That's a direct quote.\n\nI grew up immersed in the ideals of the Civil Rights Movement. My parents had met at a civil rights gathering and they made sure we learned about civil rights leaders, including lawyers like Thurgood Marshall and Constance Baker Motley. Those who battled in the courtroom to make real the Promise of America. So, at a young age, I decided I wanted to do that work.\n\nI wanted to be a lawyer and when it came time to choose the type of law I would pursue, I reflected on a pivotal moment in my life. When I was in high school, I started to notice something about my best friend Wanda. She was sad at school and there were times she didn't want to go home. So, one day I asked if everything was alright. And she confided in me that she was being sexually abused by her stepfather. And I immediately told her she had to come stay with us. And she did.\n\nThat is one of the reasons I became a prosecutor. To protect people like Wanda because I believe everyone has a right to safety, to dignity and to justice.\n\nAs a prosecutor, when I had a case I charged it not in the name of the victim, but in the name of \"The People.\" For a simple reason.\n\nIn our system of justice, a harm against any one of us is a harm against all of us. I would often explain this to console survivors of crime. To remind them, no one should be made to fight alone. We are all in this together. Every day in the courtroom, I stood proudly before a judge and said five words: \"Kamala Harris, for the People.\"\n\nAnd to be clear: My entire career, I have only had one client. The People.\n\nAnd so, on behalf of The People, on behalf of every American, regardless of party, race, gender or the language your grandmother speaks. On behalf of my mother and everyone who has ever set out on their own unlikely journey. On behalf of Americans like the people I grew up with.\n\nPeople who work hard, chase their dreams, and look out for one another.\n\nOn behalf of everyone whose story could only be written in the greatest nation on Earth. I accept your nomination for President of the United States of America. With this election, our nation has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism and divisive battles of the past.\n\nA chance to chart a new way forward, not as members of any one party or faction, but as Americans.\n\nI know there are people of various political views watching tonight and I want you to know: I promise to be a President for all Americans. You can always trust me to put country above party and self. To hold sacred America's fundamental principles. From the rule of law. To free and fair elections.\n\nTo the peaceful transfer of power: I will be a President who unites us around our highest aspirations.\n\nA President who leads and listens, who is realistic, practical and has common sense. And always fights for the American people.\n\nFrom the courthouse to the White House, that has been my life's work. As a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland, I stood up for women and children against predators who abused them. As Attorney General of California, I took on the Big Banks.Delivered $20 billion for middle-class families who faced foreclosure and helped pass a Homeowner Bill of Rights\u2014 one of the first of its kind.\n\nI stood up for veterans and students being scammed by Big for-Profit colleges, for workers who were being cheated out of the wages they were due, for seniors facing elder abuse.\n\nI fought against cartels who traffic in guns, drugs and human beings. Who threaten the security of our border and the safety of our communities. Those fights were not easy and neither were the elections that put me in those offices.\n\nWe were underestimated at every turn. But we never gave up. Because the future is always worth fighting for. And that's the fight we are in right now. A fight for America's future. Fellow Americans, this election is not only the most important of our lives. It is one of the most important in the life of our nation. In many ways, Donald Trump is an unserious man.\n\nBut the consequences of putting Donald Trump back in the White House are extremely serious. Consider not only the chaos and calamity when he was in office, but also the gravity of what has happened since he lost the last election. Donald Trump tried to throw away your votes. When he failed, he sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol where they assaulted law enforcement officers. When politicians in his own party begged him to call off the mob and send help, he did the opposite. He fanned the flames. And now, for an entirely different set of crimes, he was found guilty of fraud by a jury of everyday Americans.\n\nAnd separately, found liable for committing sexual abuse. And consider what he intends to do if we give him power again. Consider his explicit intent to set free the violent extremists who assaulted those law enforcement officers at the Capitol. His explicit intent to jail journalists, political opponents, anyone he sees as the enemy. His explicit intent to deploy our active-duty military against our own citizens.\n\nConsider the power he will have -- especially after the United States Supreme Court just ruled he would be immune from criminal prosecution. Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails.\n\nHow he would use the immense powers of the presidency of the United States. Not to improve your life. Not to strengthen our national security. But to serve the only client he has ever had: Himself.\n\nAnd we know what a second Trump term would look like. It's all laid out in \"Project 2025.\" Written by his closest advisors. And its sum total is to pull, our country back into the past. But America, we are not going back. We are not going back to when Donald Trump tried to cut Social Security and Medicare. We are not going back to when he tried to get rid of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhen insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions. We are not going to let him eliminate the Department of Education that funds our public schools. We are not going to let him end programs like Head Start that provide preschool and child care. America, we are not going back.\n\nWe are charting a new way forward. Forward -- to a future with a strong and growing middle class. Because we know a strong middle class has always been critical to America's success. And building that middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. This is personal for me. The middle class is where I come from. My mother kept a strict budget. We lived within our means. Yet, we wanted for little. And she expected us to make the most of the opportunities that were available to us. And to be grateful for them. Because opportunity is not available to everyone.\n\nThat's why we will create what I call an \"opportunity economy.\"\n\nAn opportunity economy where everyone has a chance to compete and a chance to succeed. Whether you live in a rural area, small town, or big city. As President, I will bring together labor and workers, small business owners and entrepreneurs and American companies to create jobs, grow our economy and lower the cost of everyday needs -- like health care, housing and groceries.\n\nWe will provide access to capital for small business owners, entrepreneurs, and founders. We will end America's housing shortage and protect Social Security and Medicare. Compare that to Donald Trump. He doesn't actually fight for the middle class. Instead, he fights for himself and his billionaire friends. He will give them another round of tax breaks, that will add 5 trillion dollars to the national debt.\n\nAll while he intends to enact what, in effect, is a national sales tax -- call it, a Trump tax -- that would raise prices on middle-class families by almost $4,000 a year.\n\nWell, instead of a Trump tax hike, we will pass a middle class tax cut that will benefit more than 100 million Americans.\n\nFriends, I believe America cannot truly be prosperous unless Americans are fully able to make their own decisions about their own lives. Especially on matters of heart and home. But tonight, too many women in America are not able to make those decisions. Let's be clear about how we got here.\n\nDonald Trump hand-picked members of the United States Supreme Court to take away reproductive freedom. And now he brags about it. His words: quote \"I did it, and I'm proud to have done it.\" End quote.\n\nOver the past two years, I have traveled across our country and women have told me their stories. Husbands and fathers have shared theirs. Stories of women miscarrying in a parking lot, getting sepsis, losing the ability to ever have children again.\n\nAll because doctors are afraid of going to jail for caring for their patients. Couples just trying to grow their family, cut off in the middle of IVF treatments. Children who have survived sexual assault, potentially forced to carry the pregnancy to term. This is what is happening in our country because of Donald Trump.\n\nAnd understand he is not done. As a part of his agenda, he and his allies would limit access to birth control, ban medication abortion and enact a nation-wide abortion ban with or without Congress. And, get this, he plans to create a National Anti-Abortion Coordinator and force states to report on women's miscarriages and abortions.\n\nSimply put: They are out of their minds.\n\nAnd one must ask: Why exactly is it that they don't trust women? Well, we trust women.\n\nAnd when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom, as President of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law.\n\nIn this election, Many other fundamental freedoms are at stake. The freedom to live safe from gun violence -- in our schools, communities, and places of worship -- the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. The freedom to breathe clean air, drink clean water, and live free from the pollution that fuels the climate crisis. And the freedom that unlocks all the others: the freedom to vote.\n\nWith this election, we finally have the opportunity to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. And let me be clear: after decades in law enforcement, I know the importance of safety and security, especially at our border.\n\nLast year, Joe and I brought together Democrats and conservative Republicans to write the strongest border bill in decades. The Border Patrol endorsed it, but Donald Trump believes a border deal would hurt his campaign.\n\nSo he ordered his allies in Congress to kill the deal.\n\nWell, I refuse to play politics with our security. Here is my pledge to you: As President, I will bring back the bipartisan border security bill that he killed. And I will sign it into law.\n\nI know we can live up to our proud heritage as a nation of immigrants -- and reform our broken immigration system.\n\nWe can create an earned pathway to citizenship -- and secure our border. America, we must also be steadfast in advancing our security and our values abroad.\n\nAs Vice President, I have confronted threats to our security, negotiated with foreign leaders, strengthened our alliances and engaged with our brave troops overseas.\n\nAs Commander-in-Chief, I will ensure America always has the strongest, most lethal fighting force in the world. I will fulfill our sacred obligation to care for our troops and their families.\n\nAnd I will always honor, and never disparage, their service and their sacrifice.\n\nI will make sure that we lead the world into the future on space and Artificial Intelligence, that America -- not China -- wins the competition for the 21st century, and that we strengthen -- not abdicate -- our global leadership.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, threatened to abandon NATO. He encouraged Putin to invade our allies, he aid Russia could \"do whatever the hell they want.\" Five days before Russia attacked Ukraine, I met with President Zelenskyy to warn him about Russia's plan to invade.\n\nI helped mobilize a global response -- over 50 countries -- to defend against Putin's aggression. And as President, I will stand strong with Ukraine and our NATO allies.\n\nWith respect to the war in Gaza, President Biden and I are working around the clock because now is the time to get a hostage deal and cease-fire done.\n\nLet me be clear: I will always stand up for Israel's right to defend itself and I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself because the people of Israel must never again face the horror that the terrorist organization Hamas caused on Oct. 7.\n\nIncluding unspeakable sexual violence and the massacre of young people at a music festival. At the same time, what has happened in Gaza over the past 10 months is devastating. So many innocent lives lost. Desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, over and over again.\n\nThe scale of suffering is heartbreaking. President Biden and I are working to end this war such that - Israel is secure - the hostages are released - the suffering in Gaza ends - and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity.\n\nSecurity. Freedom. And self-determination. And know this: I will never hesitate to take whatever action is necessary to defend our forces and our interests against Iran and Iran-backed terrorists. And I will not cozy up to tyrants and dictators like Kim-Jong-Un, who are rooting for Trump. Because they know he is easy to manipulate with flattery and favors.\n\nThey know Trump won't hold autocrats accountable, because he wants to be an autocrat.\n\nAs President, I will never waver in defense of America's security and ideals. Because, in the enduring struggle between democracy and tyranny, I know where I stand -- and where the United States of America belongs. Fellow Americans, I love our country with all my heart. Everywhere I go, in everyone I meet, I see a nation ready to move forward, ready for the next step, in the incredible journey that is America.\n\nI see an America where we hold fast to the fearless belief that built our nation.\n\nThat inspired the world. That here, in this country, anything is possible, nothing is out of reach.\n\nAn America, where we care for one another, look out for one another and recognize that we have so much more in common than what separates us.\n\nThat none of us has to fail for all of us to succeed and that, in unity, there is strength.\n\nOur opponents in this race are out there, everyday, denigrating America, talking about how terrible everything is.\n\nWell, my mother had another lesson she used to teach: Never let anyone tell you who you are. You show them who you are. America, Let us show each other -- and the world -- who we are and what we stand for. Freedom. Opportunity. Compassion. Dignity. Fairness.\n\nAnd endless possibilities.\n\nWe are the heirs to the greatest democracy, in the history of the world. And on behalf of our children and grandchildren and all those who sacrificed so dearly for our freedom and liberty, we must be worthy of this moment. It is now our turn to do what generations before us have done.\n\nGuided by optimism and faith, to fight for this country we love, to fight for the ideals we cherish and to uphold the awesome responsibility that comes with the greatest privilege on Earth.\n\nThe privilege and pride of being an American.\n\nSo, let's get out there and let's fight for it. Let's get out there and let's vote for it. And together, let us write the next great chapter in the most extraordinary story ever told. Thank you. God bless you. May God bless the United States of America.",

According to Market Watch, the chances of Harris winning the polls are 64% based on the stock market trends that were earlier behaving in a rather non-predictable manner.The stock market's shift towards Harris is a positive sign as it means that the investors are backing the Democrats and counting on them for the country's economy in the future. Although, this may have little impact on the polls, but the majority share of these investors are voters, and therefore some data extrapolation and analysis can help in understanding the current political landscape, ahead of the US Presidential Elections 2024 if Market Watch's report is to be believed, Harris is getting strong support from stock market investors across the US, which is evident from the investment amounts and market performance of some stocks rising right after Kamala Harris joined the ticket, following Biden's surprise exit.The stock markets help in understanding voters' mentality and is an extremely good political predictor ahead of the pols but it also needs to be remembered that the markets may not often reflect what's really on the cards. For example, in 2016, the stock markets were in favor of Hillary Clinton throughout the elections, but we all know what fate had in store for the Democratic candidate.Often, it has been observed that the markets do not respond well towards Republican candidates, and rather go for the Democrats, due to a variety of factors. It is now to be seen if the stock market predictions for the US polls 2024 turn out to be true.Yes, as of now the market trend is reflecting a good response towards Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, who is steadily gaining stronghold in the polls.Amid the incoming US polls 2024, coupled with the recession fears, the US stock markets are currently in an unpredictable situation. But, reports suggest it is favoring the Democrats, based on market behavior.",

        "text": "RFK Jr. suspends his presidential bid and backs Donald Trump before appearing with him at his rally\n\u25b6 Follow the AP\u2019s live coverage and analysis from the 2024 Democratic National Convention.\n\nPHOENIX (AP) \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suspended his independent campaign for the White House and endorsed Donald Trump on Friday, a late-stage shakeup of the race that could give the former president a modest boost from Kennedy\u2019s supporters.\n\nHours later, Kennedy joined Trump onstage at an Arizona rally, where the crowd burst into \u201cBobby!\u201d cheers.\n\nKennedy said his internal polls had shown that his presence in the race would hurt Trump and help Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, though recent public polls don\u2019t provide a clear indication that he is having an outsize impact on support for either major-party candidate.\n\nKennedy cited free speech, the war in Ukraine and \u201ca war on our children\u201d as among the reasons he would try to remove his name from the ballot in battleground states.\n\n\u201cThese are the principal causes that persuaded me to leave the Democratic Party and run as an independent, and now to throw my support to President Trump,\u201d Kennedy said at his event in Phoenix.\n\nHowever, he made clear that he wasn\u2019t formally ending his bid and said his supporters could continue to back him in the majority of states where they are unlikely to sway the outcome. Kennedy took steps to withdraw his candidacy in at least two states late this week, Arizona and Pennsylvania, but election officials in the battlegrounds of Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin said it would be too late for him to take his name off the ballot even if he wants to do so.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nKennedy said his actions followed conversations with Trump over the past few weeks. He cast their alliance as \u201ca unity party,\u201d an arrangement that would \u201callow us to disagree publicly and privately and seriously.\u201d Kennedy suggested Trump offered him a job if he returns to the White House, but neither he nor Trump offered details.\n\nKennedy\u2019s running mate, Nicole Shanahan, this week entertained the idea that Kennedy could join Trump\u2019s administration as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe announcement ended days of speculation and landed with heaps of confusion and contradictions from Kennedy\u2019s aides and allies, an emblematic cap for a quixotic campaign.\n\nShortly before his speech in Phoenix, his campaign had said in a Pennsylvania court filing that he would be endorsing Trump for president. However, a spokesperson for Kennedy said the court filing had been made in error and the lawyer who wrote it said he\u2019d correct it. Kennedy took the stage moments later, aired his grievances with the Democratic Party, the news media and political institutions, and extolled Trump. He spoke for nearly 20 minutes before he said explicitly that he was endorsing Trump.\n\nKennedy later joined Trump onstage at a rally co-hosted by Turning Point Action in Glendale, where Trump\u2019s campaign had teased he would be joined by \u201ca special guest.\u201d\n\nKennedy was greeted by thundering applause as he took the stage to the Foo Fighters and a pyrotechnics display after being introduced by Trump as \u201ca man who has been an incredible champion for so many of these values that we all share.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are both in this to do what\u2019s right for the country,\u201d Trump said, later commending Kennedy for having \u201craised critical issues that have been too long ignored in this country.\u201d\n\nWith Kennedy standing nearby, Trump invoked his slain uncle and father, John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy, saying he knows \u201cthat they are looking down right now and they are very, very proud.\u201d\n\nHe said that, if he wins this fall, he will establish a new independent presidential commission on assassination attempts that will release all remaining documents related to John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassination.\n\nAnd he repeated his pledge to establish a panel \u2014 \u201cworking with Bobby\u201d \u2014 to investigate the increase in chronic health conditions and childhood diseases, including autoimmune disorders, autism, obesity and infertility.\n\nA year ago, some would have thought it inconceivable that a member of arguably the most storied family in Democratic politics would work with Trump to keep a Democrat out of the White House. Even in recent months, Kennedy has accused Trump of betraying his followers, while Trump has criticized Kennedy as \u201cthe most radical left candidate in the race.\u201d\n\nFive of Kennedy\u2019s family members issued a statement Friday calling his support for Trump \u201ca sad ending to a sad story\u201d and reiterating their support for Harris.\n\n\u201cOur brother Bobby\u2019s decision to endorse Trump today is a betrayal of the values that our father and our family hold most dear,\u201d read the statement, which his sister Kerry Kennedy posted on X.\n\nKennedy Jr. acknowledged his decision to endorse Trump had caused tension with his family. He is married to actor Cheryl Hines, who wrote on X that she deeply respects her husband\u2019s decision to drop out but did not address the Trump endorsement.\n\n\u201cThis decision is agonizing for me because of the difficulties it causes my wife and my children and my friends,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cBut I have the certainty that this is what I\u2019m meant to do. And that certainty gives me internal peace, even in storms.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Harris campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon reached out to Kennedy\u2019s supporters who are \u201ctired of Donald Trump and looking for a new way forward\u201d and said that Harris wanted to earn their backing.\n\nAt Kennedy\u2019s Phoenix event, 38-year-old Casey Westerman said she trusted Kennedy\u2019s judgment and had planned to vote for him, but would support Trump if Kennedy endorsed him.\n\n\u201cMy decision would really be based on who he thinks is best suited to run this country,\u201d said Westerman, who wore a \u201cKennedy 2024\u201d trucker hat and voted for Trump in the last two presidential elections.\n\nKennedy first entered the 2024 presidential race as a Democrat but left the party last fall to run as an independent. He built an unusually strong base for a third-party bid, fueled in part by anti-establishment voters and vaccine skeptics who have followed his anti-vaccine work since the COVID-19 pandemic. But he has since faced strained campaign finances and mounting legal challenges.\n\nAt Trump\u2019s event in Las Vegas, Alida Roberts, 49, said Kennedy\u2019s endorsement of Trump spoke volumes about the current state of the Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cIt says that he doesn\u2019t trust what\u2019s going on, that it\u2019s not the party he grew up in,\u201d Roberts said.\n\nRoberts, who voted twice for Trump, said she was relieved and excited by the endorsement because she\u2019d been \u201cteeter-tottering\u201d between the two candidates.\n\nRecent polls put Kennedy\u2019s support in the mid-single digits, and it\u2019s unclear if he\u2019d get even that in a general election.\n\nThere\u2019s some evidence that Kennedy\u2019s staying in the race would hurt Trump more than Harris. According to a July AP-NORC poll, Republicans were significantly more likely than Democrats to have a favorable view of Kennedy. And those with a positive impression of Kennedy were significantly more likely to also have a favorable view of Trump (52%) than Harris (37%).\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Jill Colvin and Ali Swenson in New York, Rio Yamat in Las Vegas, Marc Levy in Harrisburg, Pa., Meg Kinnard in Chicago and Linley Sanders in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___ The Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

        "text": "Donald Trump for president? This time, Russia says, \u2018No thanks.\u2019\n\u201cThe Russian media coverage of the upcoming U.S. elections seems rather objective to me,\u201d says historian Lev Lurye. \u201cThe general idea is that either Trump or any candidate from the Democratic Party will be equally bad for Russia.\u201d\n\nNow, with the U.S. presidential election coming up, most Russian analysts seem to view Democratic Party nominee Kamala Harris as a continuation of the Joe Biden administration, which has hit Russia with the most intense blizzard of sanctions in history. As for Mr. Trump, even his pledge to end the Ukraine war \u201cin 24 hours\u201d is seen as likely a cynical effort to tap into the war-weariness of the U.S. electorate.\n\nMany Russians were bemused by the #Russiagate scandal, which saw Mr. Trump mired in accusations of collusion with the Kremlin for profit or underhanded electoral aid. Most of those accusations turned out to be false or greatly exaggerated, but at the time they dogged any conversation about Mr. Trump\u2019s Russia policy and seemed to make any progress impossible.\n\nRussians are not enthusiastic about the idea of Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House. While Mr. Trump may admire Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin found the chaos that surrounds Mr. Trump more trouble than it\u2019s worth.\n\nIn 2016, Russians found hope in then-newly elected President Donald Trump\u2019s promises that he would find ways to \u201cget along with Russia.\u201d\n\nRussian foreign policy experts express zero enthusiasm for another Donald Trump presidency, should he win the upcoming election. There\u2019s a simple reason why.\n\nThey\u2019ve already experienced one term of Mr. Trump in the White House, and it was the worst four years of their lives.\n\n\u201cEven if we assume that Trump genuinely wanted to improve relations with Moscow when he came in the first time, what he achieved was the exact opposite,\u201d says Fyodor Lukyanov, editor of Russia in Global Affairs, a Moscow-based foreign policy journal. \u201cThere was chaos in Washington. There was a storm around Trump that affected anything to do with Russia, and it destroyed even the most modest efforts to start a dialogue.\u201d\n\nWhy We Wrote This Russians are not enthusiastic about the idea of Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House. While Mr. Trump may admire Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin found the chaos that surrounds Mr. Trump more trouble than it\u2019s worth.\n\nRussians remain fascinated with U.S. politics. The official media has covered each dramatic turn of the 2024 presidential race over the past couple of months with a mixture of excitement, bafflement, and dark schadenfreude. But gone is any expectation that the winner is likely even to slow the relentless downward spiral of U.S.-Russia relations, much less find the new level of mutual understanding, perhaps a U.S.-Russia compact, that they once hoped for.\n\nMost Russian analysts seem to view Kamala Harris as a continuation of the Joe Biden administration, which has solidly backed Ukraine and hit Russia with the most intense blizzard of sanctions in history. As for Mr. Trump, even his pledge to end the Ukraine war \u201cin 24 hours\u201d is seen as empty verbiage at best or, more likely, a cynical effort to tap into the war-weariness of the U.S. electorate.\n\n\u201cThe Russian media coverage of the upcoming U.S. elections seems rather objective to me,\u201d says Lev Lurye, a St. Petersburg-based historian. \u201cThe general idea is that either Trump or any candidate from the Democratic Party will be equally bad for Russia.\u201d\n\nFrustration with Trump\u2019s leadership\n\nWhen it was announced that Mr. Trump had defeated Hillary Clinton back in November 2016 to become president, the entire State Duma \u2013 Russia\u2019s lower house of parliament \u2013 rose to their feet and delivered a noisy, sustained standing ovation.\n\nSuch were the hopes aroused, not only among officials but ordinary Russians as well, by Mr. Trump\u2019s expressions of admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin and promises during his first presidential campaign that he would find ways to \u201cget along with Russia.\u201d\n\nBut they quickly were dashed once he entered office.\n\nJorge Silva/AP/File President Trump and President Putin talk during a photo session at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in Danang, Vietnam, Nov. 11, 2017.\n\nMany Russians were bemused by the #Russiagate scandal, which saw Mr. Trump mired in accusations that he had colluded with the Kremlin in unsavory ways for years, that he was profiting from lucrative business deals in Moscow, and that Russian internet trolls had helped to secure his election by manipulating social media in the U.S. Most of those accusations turned out to be false or greatly exaggerated, but at the time they dogged any conversation about Mr. Trump\u2019s Russia policy and seemed to make any progress impossible.\n\nIt all came to a head at the July 2018 Helsinki summit, where Mr. Putin tried to press Russia\u2019s agenda on issues like the war in Syria and nuclear arms control. But the summit was quickly overshadowed by Mr. Trump\u2019s unusually deferential stance toward the Russian leader, which triggered a strong critical response among U.S. media and officials.\n\n\u201cThe main thing that struck me, watching that show in Helsinki, was the total mismatch between the substantive issues that two leaders were supposed to be discussing, and the utter lack of interest in any of those things that was displayed at the press conference,\u201d says Mr. Lukyanov. \u201cNobody wanted to hear anything about the actual agenda. They were only interested in some supposed secret relationship between Trump and Putin.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe thought that Trump was different\u201d\n\nThe widespread view in Moscow now seems to be that U.S. hostility to Russia is hardwired, and unlikely to change regardless of whoever becomes president.\n\n\u201cMuch of the Russian political elite thinks that the U.S. deep state is in charge, directing events, and no political actors can change anything,\u201d says Alexei Mukhin, director of the independent Center for Political Information, a Moscow think tank. \u201cWe thought that Trump was different, but now it looks like he\u2019s just another agent of the deep state.\u201d\n\nBut some watch the electoral turbulence, the deep polarization, and the somewhat disorderly changes at the top with a bit of satisfaction. The way the former Soviet Union tried to reform itself with a younger leader, and then collapsed, is a staple analogy in Russian news commentaries.\n\nSergei Markov, a former Kremlin adviser, says Russia is less interested in U.S. political developments and more concerned about the shifting global order, in which Russians perceive the U.S. steadily losing ground. New faces such as Ms. Harris aren\u2019t likely to reverse the underlying dynamics of decay, he argues.\n\nDeepen your worldview\n\nwith Monitor Highlights.

This is a very dangerous time, and there is a possibility that expanding crises can lead to a real world war. That would be catastrophic.\u201d",

        "text": "Kamala Harris rises in polls. See how election odds changed after the convention\nWhere has the convention bump gone?\n\nThe odds on Polymarket, a crypto-trading platform, swung in favor of Donald Trump's presidential campaign last week even as Kamala Harris and Tim Walz were being celebrated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.\n\nTrump's odds of winning took an even bigger hit in the midst of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, falling from a peak of 71% following the assassination attempt to 63% the morning after the convention concluded.\n\nAs of Sept. 4 at 7 a.m. EDT, bettors bid up a Trump win since backing following the Democrats' convention week. The betting \u2013 which legally can't be done in the U.S. \u2013 puts the likelihood of Trump winning the election at 52% and Harris' at 47%. Just ahead of the convention, bettors placed Harris' odds of winning as high as 54%.\n\nTrump's polling at odds with bettors:See where 2024 election betting odds stand after Labor Day\n\nHow Harris' and Trump's odds of winning the election changed during their convention weeks\n\nUnable to view our graphics? Click here to see them.\n\n2024 presidential election predictions\n\nAs part of his academic research, Harry Crane, a Rutgers University statistics professor, has studied election outcomes since 2016 and compared those to the predictions of polling and betting markets like Polymarket.\n\nDuring the Democratic convention week, polling tracked by Real Clear Politics showed Harris' national average continuing to rise while Trump's inched down. The online bettors on Polymarket and Betfair, the world's largest online betting exchange, sent those markets in opposite directions.\n\nHow presidential election polls compare to election odds\n\nWhy are Kamala Harris' odds tumbling but presidential polls rising?\n\nSo what are the bettors saying? \"The market price at any given time reflects the collective opinion of the market based on the information that's available,\" Crane said and speculated at what bettors might be considering:\n\n\u25fe Scrutiny of Harris' proposals:Harris outlined her economic plans on Aug. 16, and bettors may foresee potential pushback from voters in key areas. \"The people who are driving these markets have quite a bit of science behind it,\" Crane said. \"They might know the demographics of a state like Pennsylvania \u2013 down to where they understand the sliver of the population that's really going to decide the election.\"\n\n\u25fe Less favorable polling: While the Harris campaign continues to see incremental gains in national polls, Trump polled 2 percentage points better in the most recent poll of voters in Arizona, a battleground state.\n\n\u25fe Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: Speculation had been swirling for days about the future of Kennedy's campaign. Kennedy dropped out of the presidential race Friday afternoon and said he would support Trump.\n\nCrane said similar speculation about Trump's potential opponent likely drove his numbers down during the Republican convention. Crane said bettors probably saw Harris as a stronger Democratic candidate, which pushed down Trump's odds of winning as it looked more likely that Joe Biden would drop out.\n\nIs there a post-convention bump?\n\nCrane said bettors likely anticipate some bump in the polls following the conventions, so they discount such changes in their analyses. But significant election bumps also appear to be a thing of the past.\n\nFrom the Monday of their convention to the Monday after, neither Trump nor Harris had as much as a percentage point bump the national polling tracked by Real Clear Politics.\n\nHow much presidential candidates' polling improved following conventions\n\nSince 1964 presidential candidates have had about a 5 percentage point convention bounce in polling, according to research by The American Presidency Project. That hasn't happened since 2008 when John McCain and Barack Obama watched their numbers jump 6 and 4 points, respectively.\n\nUp next: What odds will bettors give Trump's and Harris' campaigns following their first debate scheduled for Sept. 10.\n\nHow accurate have election odds been in past presidential elections?\n\nThe betting favorite has only lost twice since 1866, according to the Conversation, a nonprofit news organization.\n\nThe two upsets came in 1948 when Democrat Harry Truman beat eight-to-one odds to defeat Republican Thomas Dewey, and in 2016 when Trump overcame seven-to-two odds to beat Hillary Clinton.\n\nContributing: James Powel",

        "text": "Crypto industry accounts for almost half of corporate donations in 2024 election, report says\nwatch now\n\nAs the 2024 U.S. elections reach their home stretch, crypto companies are opening their wallets to try and influence the results. Nearly half of all the corporate money flowing into the election has come from the crypto industry, according to a report this week from the nonprofit watchdog group Public Citizen. The sum, approximately $119 million, was raised from a mix of contributors, with Coinbase and Ripple accounting for more than 80% of the donations. Most of the money is going to super PACs that are backing pro-crypto candidates running for office this year. The industry has faced heightened scrutiny during the Biden administration, and Coinbase and Ripple are two of the biggest players that have been engaged in legal battles with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, has tried to exploit the rift between the crypto industry and the Democrats by pitching himself as the pro-crypto choice and even keynoting a major bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, last month. But money is flowing into both parties, as the House, Senate and the presidency remain very much up for grabs.\n\nwatch now\n\nNo other sector is keeping up with crypto. That includes oil companies and banks, which have historically been big political contributors. Since 2010, when the Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling opened the door for limitless corporate money in U.S. elections, the crypto sector has accounted for 15% of all disclosed contributions, according to the report from Public Citizen. More than 90% of the corporate crypto cash that's been raised was brought in this election cycle. Rick Claypool, research director at Public Citizen, who authored the latest report, said the massive money poured in by crypto companies to \"silence crypto's critics and elevate its backers embodies everything that is wrong with the Supreme Court's disastrous Citizens United decision.\" Claypool's research shows that crypto corporations are second only to fossil fuel conglomerates in total election-related spending since the 2010 ruling.\n\nFairshake is the most popular of the pro-crypto, bipartisan super PACs. It's funded by some of the industry's leading companies and has become one of the top-spending PACs this year. The majority of the group's funds can be traced to four sources. Coinbase has contributed $49 million, venture firm Andreessen Horowitz has donated $47 million, Ripple has given $47 million and Jump Crypto put in $15 million. In total, Fairshake and its two affiliated PACs have raised around $169 million, with more than 90% coming directly from corporations. Other funds have come from a mix of donors. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, for example, gave $1 million, while the Winklevoss twins put in $5 million. A filing with the Federal Election Commission on Tuesday showed that during July, Fairshake disbursed almost $75 million. Data compiled from FEC reports by OpenSecrets indicates that Fairshake has nearly $120 million in its coffers to deploy with less than 80 days to go until the November election. The super PAC has pledged $25 million from that pool of cash to 18 House candidates in the general election, to be split among nine Democrats and nine Republicans. It's committed another $18 million to three Senate races.\n\nThe industry's strategy paid off in the primaries. Public Citizen's report found that of the 42 primary races that attracted money from crypto-backed super PACs, the candidate picked by the crypto industry won 36. But many of them aren't publicly promoting their stance on crypto. \"When Fairshake and its affiliates spend money to influence races, either by attacking crypto skeptics or boosting crypto supporters, the ads don't mention crypto at all,\" said Claypool. In New York and California congressional races, the crypto-funded campaign ads attacked the targeted candidates with traditional political jabs, and no mention of crypto. \"The sole reason crypto is a hot-button topic in this election cycle is that crypto businesses are spending eye-popping sums to make themselves impossible to ignore,\" Claypool said. Democrats are trying to show they can find common ground with the industry despite the tension that's emerged in recent years. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., kicked off a virtual town hall dubbed \"Crypto4Harris\" in August. He said at the event that a crypto law could pass the Senate by the end of the year. Vice President Kamala Harris's campaign team is actively working to craft a platform stance around the crypto industry and reset the approach taken by President Joe Biden, several key Democrats told CNBC. On Tuesday, Harris' campaign announced plans to adopt a pro-crypto innovation stance. Coinbase Chief Policy Officer Faryar Shirzad praised the move, writing on X that he's been \"pleased to take part in a number of discussions with the Harris team.\" He described the approach as \"constructive\" and said \"the dialogue had been an important first step.\"\n\nMeanwhile, money has rolled into Trump's campaign from digital asset executives since he leaned into being the pro-crypto candidate. Trump has adopted increasingly bullish talking points on cryptocurrencies on the campaign trail, and he announced in late July that he had raised $25 million from crypto interests, a figure that CNBC hasn't independently confirmed. Crypto executives have turned up at fundraisers for Trump in San Francisco and Nashville, where the Republican nominee told an audience of conferencegoers that if he were returned to the White House, he would ensure that the federal government never sells off its bitcoin holdings. \"This afternoon I'm laying out my plan to ensure that the United States will be the crypto capital of the planet and the bitcoin superpower of the world,\" Trump said. \"And we'll get it done.\"",

        "text": "Robert F Kennedy Jr suspends campaign and backs Trump\nRobert F Kennedy Jr suspends campaign and backs Trump\n\nFoo Fighters and fireworks: Trump introduces RFK at rally\n\nIndependent White House candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr has joined the Republican nominee, Donald Trump, on stage at a rally in Arizona after dropping out of the race and endorsing the former US president. Mr Kennedy, 70, a Democrat for most of his life and the scion of the Kennedy dynasty, said the principles that had led him to leave the party had now compelled him \"to throw my support to President Trump\". He said in a press conference in Phoenix, Arizona, on Friday that he would seek to remove his name from the ballot in 10 battleground states. Before welcoming RFK Jr to the stage on Friday, Trump promised, if elected, to release all remaining documents relating to the 1963 assassination of President John F Kennedy.\n\nTrump praised Mr Kennedy as \"phenomenal\" and \"brilliant\" at the rally later in Glendale. Democratic rival Kamala Harris said she would try to \"earn\" the support of Kennedy voters. With November's election looming, Mr Kennedy's polling has slumped from a high of double figures as funds and national coverage dried up. The son of US Senator Robert F Kennedy and nephew of President John F Kennedy, he is from the most famed family in Democratic politics. Mr Kennedy's decision to back a Republican for the White House has outraged his relatives, who previously condemned his invocation of the family name in a Super Bowl ad back in February. Kerry Kennedy, his sister, said his support for Trump was a \"betrayal of the values that our father and our family hold most dear. It is a sad ending to a sad story.\" \u201cThis decision is agonising for me because of the difficulties it causes my wife and my children and my friends,\u201d Mr Kennedy said on Friday. \u201cBut I have the certainty that this is what I\u2019m meant to do. And that certainty gives me internal peace, even in storms.\u201d He is married to Cheryl Hines, the star of HBO comedy Curb Your Enthusiasm. She posted on X, formerly Twitter, that she deeply respected her husband\u2019s decision to suspend his campaign. She did not comment on his endorsement of Trump.\n\nUS election: RFK Jr drops presidential campaign and supports Donald Trump\n\nMr Kennedy told reporters on Friday that Trump's insistence he could end the war in Ukraine by negotiating with Russia \"alone would justify my support for his campaign\". \"There are still many issues and approaches on which we continue to have very serious differences. But we are aligned on other key issues.\" He said he would remove his name from 10 states where his presence would be a \"spoiler\" to Trump's effort. He has already withdrawn from the battleground states of Arizona and Pennsylvania. But it is too late for him to pull out from the swing states of Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin, election officials told AP news agency. Mr Kennedy said he had launched his campaign in April 2023 \"as a Democrat, the party of my father, my uncle... the champions of the Constitution\". But he left because \"it had become the party of war, censorship, corruption, big pharma, big tech, big money\". He blamed his decision to suspend his campaign on \"media control\" and his former party's efforts to thwart his run, adding: \"In my heart I no longer believe I have a realistic path to victory in the face of relentless and systematic censorship.\"\n\nReuters Trump welcomes RFK on stage in Glendale, Arizona\n\nMr Kennedy hovered around 14% - 16% in polls at his most popular. However, his ratings have slumped to single digits since Ms Harris became the Democratic nominee. He said in his press conference that he had offered to work with Ms Harris and her bid for the White House. Democrats sounded unfazed by his announcement. \"Donald Trump isn't earning an endorsement that's going to help build support, he's inheriting the baggage of a failed fringe candidate. Good riddance,\" Democratic National Committee senior adviser Mary Beth Cahill said in a statement. Mr Kennedy's campaign became synonymous with the anti-vaccine movement as he frequently touted his leadership of the Children's Health Defense organisation, formerly known as the World Mercury Project. In recent weeks, Mr Kennedy recounted how he dumped a dead bear cub that had been hit by a car in New York's Central Park in 2014 as a joke. Earlier in his campaign, it was revealed that he had suffered from a brain parasite over a decade ago which caused severe memory loss and brain fog. His announcement capped days of rumour that Mr Kennedy offered to endorse Trump to secure a role in his next administration. Trump told CNN earlier this week he would \"certainly be open\" to Mr Kennedy playing a role, while Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr, said he would be suited to \"blow up\" a federal department. Merrill Matthews, a resident scholar with the conservative Institute for Policy Innovation, told the BBC that Mr Kennedy's decision highlighted the two-party system in the US and \"how difficult it is to get new ideas and fresh people into the process\". Mike Wendling also contributed to this report.",

        "text": "August 24, 2024, presidential campaign news\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. delivers remarks on August 23 in Phoenix. Rebecca Noble/Getty Images\n\nWhen Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suspended his presidential campaign, he did it in the most complicated way.\n\nKennedy will take himself off the ballot in certain key states, but says he is encouraging supporters to vote for him in safe red and blue states so that he can feature in a \u201ccontingent election\u201d if former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris tie. In the battleground states, Kennedy said he\u2019s supporting Trump.\n\nHere\u2019s what you should know:\n\nWhat\u2019s a contingent election? If there\u2019s a 269-269 tie in the contest for 538 Electoral College votes, or if a third-party or independent candidate wins electoral votes and keeps both candidates from reaching an Electoral College majority of 270, the next step is called a \u201ccontingent election.\u201d\n\nAccording to the 12th Amendment, the new House of Representatives, which would have just been sworn in on January 3, chooses the president. The Senate would choose the vice president.\n\nCould Kennedy actually feature in such an election? Short answer: No. He could not take part unless he won electoral votes, something that does not seem to be mathematically possible. Perhaps he\u2019s envisioning an elector going rogue and supporting him in defiance of voters, but Kennedy did not share details of his thinking.\n\nCould a tie actually happen this year? Yes. While a tie is not a likely outcome, it is something to be ready for.\n\nHere is one plausible scenario for the 2024 election: If Harris wins Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada and a single electoral vote in Nebraska, all of which Joe Biden won in 2020, but she loses Pennsylvania and Georgia, there\u2019s a tie, 269-269.\n\nThe website 270 to Win also has more tied-election scenarios.\n\nHow would the process work? The nation would clearly be divided. Lawmakers could be torn between supporting their preferred candidate and the one their state\u2019s voters preferred.\n\nHouse members can only choose from among the top three finishers in the Electoral College for president, and senators can choose from among the top two finishers for vice president. Kennedy would presumably need to win electoral votes \u2014 either a state, or a congressional district in Nebraska or Maine \u2014 in order to be an option in a contingent election. There\u2019s no chance of that happening at the moment.\n\nRead more about a contingent election here.",

        "text": "Robert F. Kennedy suspends his independent presidential campaign and backs Trump\nRobert F. Kennedy suspends his independent presidential campaign and backs Trump\n\ntoggle caption Rebecca Noble/Getty Images\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. is suspending his long-shot independent presidential candidacy. He announced Friday that he is seeking to remove his name from ballots in battleground states, and is instead asking supporters to back Republican nominee Donald Trump.\n\nKennedy \u2014 a scion of a famous American political family who is now known broadly as an anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist \u2014 vowed to upend the two-party system but failed to gain the traction needed to compete in the race.\n\nSpeaking in Phoenix on Friday, Kennedy said in an \u201chonest system\u201d he believed he would win the election and railed against the media and the Democratic Party for perceived slights against his campaign.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cIn my heart, I no longer believe that I have a realistic path of electoral victory in the face of this relentless, systematic censorship and media control,\u201d he said.\n\nThroughout the lengthy address, Kennedy constantly bemoaned what he called attacks on democracy \u2014 while backing a candidate in Trump who tried to overturn his 2020 election defeat.\n\nKennedy said he and Trump have spoken in recent weeks, and said that while he disagrees with Trump on several issues, they agree on certain important things, like the war in Ukraine, alleged censorship and childhood safety.\n\nHe also indicated the two of them have discussed a possible role for Kennedy going forward.\n\n\u201c[P]harma executives and consultants and lobbyists cycle in and out of these [government regulatory] agencies,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cWith President Trump's backing I'm going to change that. We're going to staff these agencies with honest scientists and doctors who are free from industry funding, or make sure the decisions of consumers, doctors and patients are informed by unbiased science.\u201d\n\nAfter Kennedy\u2019s running mate signaled in recent days that they could end their campaign and back Trump, the former president told CNN that he would consider giving Kennedy a role in a potential second Trump administration if Kennedy dropped out and endorsed him.\n\nIn remarks in Nevada Friday, Trump thanked \u201cBobby\u201d for the endorsement and called him \u201ca great guy.\u201d\n\nKennedy\u2019s campaign has upset many members of his family. Five of his siblings wrote in a statement Friday that, \u201cOur brother Bobby\u2019s decision to endorse Trump today is a betrayal of the values that our father and our family hold dear. It is a sad ending to a sad story.\u201d\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\nRFK saw diminishing support in recent months\n\nKennedy initially challenged President Biden in the Democratic primary before switching to an independent run , promising to deliver another choice for voters unhappy with what was then a rematch between Biden and Trump.\n\nWhile his campaign launched with an ambitious plan to appeal to voters across the ideological spectrum, RFK leaned into conspiracies about America, the government and vaccines that appealed especially to a smaller swath of voters and those who do not normally cast a ballot.\n\nIn part due to his famous political name, Kennedy appeared poised to siphon votes from Democratic-leaning voters who soured on Biden\u2019s age and perceived fitness for office, but Kennedy focused his efforts more toward communicating with the right.\n\nKennedy frequented right-wing podcasts and television shows, and unsuccessfully attempted to woo the Libertarian Party at their national convention. He saw a barrage of negative headlines overshadow his campaign, from allegations of sexual assault to eating a barbecued dog to a recent revelation he was responsible for dumping a bear cub in Central Park .\n\nHis campaign faced significant challenges obtaining access to state ballots, but it ran the most successful independent national ballot access effort in 30 years, navigating onerous state laws and fighting off well-funded legal challenges to submit more than a million signatures across 50 states. As of Friday, his campaign was on roughly 20 state ballots.\n\nBut those efforts did not translate to much electoral support, especially after Vice President Harris replaced Biden as the Democratic nominee.\n\nKennedy dropped from a high of around 15% to the low single digits in national election polls. In the latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll, conducted earlier this month , he enjoyed 5% support.\n\nThe latest financial disclosures showed signs of Kennedy\u2019s struggles, too, with the campaign ending July with $3.9 million cash on hand, $3.4 million in debt and a nearly $1 million refund to his running mate Nicole Shanahan, a wealthy California attorney who poured in $15 million of her own money to help with ballot access measures.\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nSo what happens next in places where Kennedy is already on the ballot, and what impact does his endorsement of Trump potentially have on the outcome in November? It depends.\n\nEach state has its own deadlines for finalizing the slate of candidates and preparing ballots for voters, and differing rules for removing those names.\n\nKennedy withdrew his name from the Arizona ballot Thursday, for example, and a Pennsylvania filing obtained Friday seeks to remove him from that state's ballot. But he reportedly missed Nevada\u2019s Aug. 20 deadline to back out there \u2014 though Nevada is one of several states where legal challenges to his candidacy are still pending.\n\nMany recent polls show Kennedy drawing slightly more support away from Trump than Harris, so Kennedy might have an incentive to remove his name from the ballot in battleground states to avoid playing a spoiler for his newly endorsed ally.\n\nIn a campaign memo Friday, Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio pointed to survey results and wrote, \u201cThis is good news for President Trump and his campaign \u2013 plain and simple.\u201d\n\nDemocrats disagree, with a party memo sent Friday morning arguing that his candidacy was a \u201ca tool to mislead voters and hurt Democrats, and RFK Jr.\u2019s exit is an admission their gambit failed.\u201d\n\nKennedy spent most of his life as a Democrat and still has certain political views that align more with the party, especially around climate change and environmental activism, that could prevent some supporters from switching to Trump.\n\nSupporters who backed RFK Jr.\u2019s campaign because they wanted an option other than the Democratic and Republican parties could switch to another independent campaign. Others, who told NPR that Kennedy was the only candidate they would vote for, could also sit out this election.",

Report says\u2026\nAmerican pop star Beyonce will perform on Thursday, the final night of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, reported Reuters, citing entertainment website TMZ. The same night, Vice President Kamala Harris will accept the Democratic Party nomination for the upcoming US Presidential Election 2024.\n\nSo far, Beyonce's performance at the DNC has not been confirmed. However, there were hints of Beyonce's possible appearance at the programme after Kamala Harris adopted her \u201cFreedom\u201d song for a campaign rally. She also took the stage in Chicago on Monday to the tune. According to news agency Reuters, Beyonce has reportedly allowed VP Harris to use the song in her presidential election campaign.\n\nBeyonce representative denies reports Amid speculations about Beyonce's performance, a representative of the American pop singer has denied reports that she will perform on the final night of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on Thursday, reported Reuters citing Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThere was no official confirmation or denial after the entertainment website TMZ and The Hill reported the singer would perform to cap off the night, when Vice President Kamala Harris formally accepts the Democratic Party nomination.\n\n\"Beyonc\u00e9 was never scheduled to be there,\" a representative for the singer told The Hollywood Reporter. \"The report of a performance is untrue.\"\n\nAlso Read | Kamala Harris family: From potential first gentleman spouse to stepkids\n\nWho will perform at the DNC tonight? According to media reports, pop singer Pink will perform at the convention Thursday night. Country group The Chicks will perform the national anthem at about 8 p.m, reported jsonline.com. The DNC program began at the United Center at 5:30 p.m. CT (4:00 am IST).\n\nDemocratic National Convention Kamala Harris' confirmation as Democratic nominee for the upcoming Presidential election will be the key highlight of the final night of the convention on Thursday.\n\nHarris' address in Chicago caps a whirlwind eight weeks in American politics and manifests the stunning reversal of Democratic fortunes just 75 days until Election Day.

        "text": "Will Kamala Harris become next US President? Indian Nostradamus has a prediction for it\nKamala Harris\u2019 Historic Nomination\n\n\n\nThe Indian Nostradamus\u2019 Prediction\n\n\n\nWhat Lies Ahead?\n\n\n\nWith the announcement of Kamala Harris as the Democratic Party\u2019s nominee for the 2024 U.S. presidential election, speculation about her future has reached a fever pitch. Among those offering insights is a prominent Vedic astrologer, often dubbed the \"Indian Nostradamus,\" who had previously made predictions regarding the upcoming election.Kamala Harris, currently serving as the Vice President of the United States, officially accepted the Democratic nomination for the 2024 presidential race. This development follows President Joe Biden\u2019s withdrawal from the race, citing his advanced age and endorsing Harris as his successor. If elected, Harris would become the first woman, and the first person of Indian descent, to hold the highest office in the United States.During her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Harris vowed to lead the nation towards unity and progress. \u201cWith this election, our nation has a precious and fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism, and divisive battles of the past,\u201d Harris declared. She also took the opportunity to honor her Indian roots, reflecting on the journey of her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, who traveled alone from India to California to pursue her dream of becoming a scientist.The Vedic astrologer, who has garnered attention for his accurate predictions in the past, published a piece that hinted at significant political changes in the U.S. during the latter part of 2024. In his article, he suggested that the period between mid-October and mid-November 2024 would be critical, with \"like-minded forces\" coming together to shape the future of the country.The astrologer further noted that the individual most likely to become the next U.S. president would possess a \"high-level lawyer-like or a sound economist-like mindset\" and would be well-suited to face challenges head-on. Although the prediction used gender-neutral language, the description aligns closely with Kamala Harris' background as a lawyer and her experience in the political arena.As Harris prepares to face off against her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump , many are curious to see how the astrologer\u2019s predictions will unfold. While his analysis suggests that Harris could be on the path to victory, the astrologer has also indicated that a more detailed study of the candidates\u2019 birth charts will be necessary to provide a final opinion.In the meantime, Harris remains focused on her campaign, aiming to bring a \"New Way Forward\" for America.",

        "text": "Robert F Kennedy Jr\u2019s brother \u2018heartbroken\u2019 over Trump endorsement\nMax Kennedy, the brother of Robert F Kennedy Jr, has implored the public to ignore his sibling\u2019s decision to drop out of the 2024 presidential election and endorse Donald Trump\u2019s campaign to return to the White House.\n\nIn an op-ed for the Los Angeles Times, Max Kennedy said: \u201cTrump was exactly the kind of arrogant, entitled bully\u201d that his father, the former US senator and attorney general Robert F Kennedy, stood against before he was assassinated in 1968 as he pursued the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nMax Kennedy predicted his father would have admired the Democratic nominee for November\u2019s election, Vice-President Kamala Harris, because she was a former prosecutor as well.\n\n\u201cHer career, like his, has been all about decency, dignity, equality, democracy and justice for all,\u201d Max Kennedy wrote.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m heartbroken over my brother Bobby\u2019s endorsement of Donald Trump,\u201d the piece added. \u201cRobert F Kennedy\u2019s life was dedicated to promoting the safety, security and happiness of the American people.\u201d\n\nRobert F Kennedy Jr made the announcement that he was suspending his independent presidential campaign on Thursday. He soon appeared with Trump at a political rally in Arizona where he formally backed the former president, who clinched the Republican nomination despite his conviction on 34 felony charges of falsifying business records to conceal hush-money payments to the adult film actor Stormy Daniels, among various other legal problems.\n\nKennedy said he planned to remove his name from the 2024 presidential election ballot in swing states to boost Trump\u2019s chances of retaking the Oval Office. But Kennedy said he would remain on the ballot in other states that are not expected to decide the presidential race.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News on Sunday, Robert F Kennedy Jr claimed his campaign was undermined by \u201ccensorship\u201d by the media \u2013 and not being included in the June presidential debate that preceded Joe Biden\u2019s decision to halt his presidential re-election bid.\n\nKennedy also described his periodic conversations with Trump before Thursday\u2019s endorsement announcement, including one hours after the failed assassination attempt of the former president in July.\n\nWhile they agreed that they would be able to continue criticizing each other in connection with issues on which they don\u2019t see eye to eye, \u201che invited me to form a unity government\u201d, Kennedy said of Trump.\n\nKennedy\u2019s presidential bid and endorsement of Trump has drawn sharp criticism from the rest of his family. That includes his wife, the actor Cheryl Hines, whom Kennedy has acknowledged was \u201cvery uncomfortable\u201d with his endorsement of Trump despite her statement that she \u201cdeeply\u201d respected her husband\u2019s decision.\n\nAnd, before its suspension, his campaign was replete with controversies, including a sexual assault allegation made against him by a former staffer and the proliferation of numerous conspiracy theories over vaccine safety, Covid 19, wireless internet, the 9/11 terrorist attacks and antidepressants.\n\nMax Kennedy, a lawyer, is younger than his former presidential candidate brother. He is the ninth child of Robert F Kennedy and Ethel Kennedy \u2013 and he was the nephew of John F Kennedy, who was president when he was assassinated in 1963.\n\nHe characterized his brother\u2019s endorsement of Trump as \u201cinconceivable\u201d, noting how he had offered Harris his endorsement in exchange for a position in her administration if she won. But Max Kennedy said his brother received no response from the Harris camp and successfully offered the same deal to Trump.\n\n\u201cIt is all the more tragic because of our brother\u2019s name. To carry the name Robert F Kennedy Jr means a special legacy within a legacy,\u201d Max Kennedy wrote, explaining his father\u2019s record cut a stark contrast with Trump\u2019s on anti-racism, immigration, the rule of law, the environment and gun control. Max Kennedy said the same was true with respect to truth and democracy, apparently an allusion to Trump\u2019s falsehoods about having been robbed of victory in the 2020 presidential race by electoral fraudsters, which drove his supporters to mount the deadly US Capitol attack in early January 2021.\n\n\u201cI love Bobby. But I hate what he is doing to our country,\u201d Max Kennedy wrote. \u201cIt is worse than disappointment. We are in mourning.\n\n\u201cNever in my wildest dreams did I imagine I would be motivated to write something of this nature. With a heavy heart, I am today asking my fellow Americans to do what will honor our father the most: Ignore Bobby and support vice-president Kamala Harris and the Democratic platform. It\u2019s what is best for our country.\u201d\n\nKennedy on Sunday said everyone in his family needs \u201cto be able to disagree with each other and still love each other\u201d.",

        "text": "August 25, 2024, presidential campaign news\nThen-national security adviser Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster at the White House in 2017. Yuri Gripas/Reuters\n\nUntil now, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster has held his fire about his stint in the Trump White House.\n\nMcMaster served with distinction in key American conflicts of the past decades: the Gulf War, the Iraq War and the war in Afghanistan, but as McMaster recounts in his new book, \u201cAt War with Ourselves: My Tour of Duty in the Trump White House,\u201d in some ways, his most challenging tour as a soldier was his last one: serving as the national security adviser to a notoriously mercurial president.\n\nIn his blistering, insightful account of his time in the Trump White House, McMaster describes meetings in the Oval Office as \u201cexercises in competitive sycophancy\u201d during which Donald Trump\u2019s advisers would flatter the president by saying stuff like, \u201cYour instincts are always right\u201d or, \u201cNo one has ever been treated so badly by the press.\u201d Meanwhile, Trump would say \u201coutlandish\u201d things like, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just bomb the drugs?\u201d in Mexico or, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we take out the whole North Korean Army during one of their parades?\u201d\n\nMcMaster wasn\u2019t going to make the same mistake after Trump tapped him to be his national security adviser in February 2017. He writes, \u201cI knew that to fulfill my duty, I would have to tell Trump what he didn\u2019t want to hear.\u201d This helps explain why McMaster lasted just over a year in the job. (Disclosure: I have known McMaster professionally since 2010, when he ran an anti-corruption task force in Afghanistan.)\n\nMcMaster\u2019s book, which focuses on Trump\u2019s tenure as commander in chief, comes at a particularly timely moment, just as many Americans start to really consider whether Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris would make a better commander in chief.\n\nMcMaster provides unique detail on Trump\u2019s approach to foreign policy and \u2014 similarly to his successor in the national security adviser role, former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton, who wrote scathingly about the former president in a book published in 2020 \u2014 his account is likely to do little to reassure US allies about the prospects of a second Trump term.\n\nRead more about McMaster\u2019s thoughts on Trump here.",

        "text": "The Muslim American vote matters and it can no longer be taken for granted\nIn key swing states the Democrats won narrowly in 2020, Muslim Americans make up a significant voting bloc. And they have a single voting priority: Gaza.\n\nAs the United States presidential election approaches, the race to attract voters has intensified. Among the different constituencies the Democrats and Republicans are battling over, there is one that stands out: the Muslim community.\n\nAlthough Muslims constitute roughly 1 percent of the American population, they are an important voting bloc because they are concentrated in swing states, which are often narrowly won in elections.\n\nIn this election cycle, the Muslim community seems more united than ever over a single political issue: the war in Gaza. Any candidate hoping to win over large segments of Muslim voters would have to address community demands for an end to the bloodshed in Palestine.\n\nThis is according to a new study published by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding (ISPU) in partnership with Emgage and Change Research. It is based on a survey conducted in late June and early July focused on how Muslims in three swing states \u2013 Georgia, Pennsylvania and Michigan \u2013 intend to vote in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nWhat we found is that President Joe Biden\u2019s handling of the war in Gaza has turned Muslims, who in 2020 were some of his biggest supporters, into his sharpest detractors.\n\nIn 2020, about 65 percent of Muslim voters in these states showed up to cast their ballots for Biden. This support was vital to his electoral victory because he won key swing states by small margins. He won Georgia by just 12,000 votes, a state where more than 61,000 Muslims voted, and Pennsylvania by 81,000 votes, where 125,000 Muslims voted.\n\nBy contrast, in our survey, conducted before Biden dropped out of the presidential race, only 12 percent of respondents said they would vote for him, marking a dramatic drop in support not seen among any other group studied. While this impacts the presidential race, it has also manifested in a broader disillusionment with the establishment of the Democratic Party.\n\nThe war on Gaza has unified Muslim voters in a way that no other issue has in recent memory. According to the 2020 American Muslim Poll conducted by ISPU, healthcare (19 percent), the economy (14 percent) and social justice (13 percent) were the top voting issues for Muslim voters.\n\nCompare that with 2024: Across the partisan spectrum, the top priority of Muslim voters in Georgia, Pennsylvania and Michigan is the war in Gaza (61 percent), followed by keeping the US out of foreign wars (22 percent).\n\nReduction of military aid to Israel also garnered the support of the vast majority of Muslim voters in our study, who, regardless of partisan sentiments, all overwhelmingly see this policy as a reason to vote for a candidate. While a war overseas may seem far from the daily concerns of American Muslim voters, many see the US role \u2013 providing unconditional aid and diplomatic cover to Israel \u2013 as complicity in the continued oppression of Palestinians.\n\nThe importance of the war in Gaza for Muslim voters was made clear months before we conducted our survey. The Muslim community played a leading role in the Uncommitted National Movement, which urged Democratic voters to vote \u201cuncommitted\u201d in presidential primaries in their states. The initiative managed to get more than 700,000 Democrats to do so, making clear their demand for a change in the Biden administration\u2019s tone and policy on Israel and Palestine.\n\nThis dramatic Muslim migration away from Biden is not a wholesale leap to the other side of the aisle, however. Muslim support for Trump inched up from 18 percent in 2020 to 22 percent in 2024 in Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\nOverwhelmingly, former Muslim supporters of Biden are moving to third parties or are still undecided. Our study found that nearly a third of Muslim voters will either vote a third-party candidate (27 percent) or write in a candidate (3 percent). About 17 percent of Muslims said they have yet to decide on a candidate compared with 6 percent of the general public.\n\nThis means there is still room and time for candidates to win over this vital constituency. And it seems they are trying.\n\nNot only has Biden pulled out of the race, but Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris has signalled she is distancing herself from his unflinching support for Israel\u2019s war on Gaza. In July, the vice president did not attend Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s address to Congress, said she will not be silent about the suffering in Gaza and made clear her support for a ceasefire.\n\nIn August, she picked as her running mate Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, who is widely regarded as more sympathetic to the Palestinian cause than short-listed Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. This year, Walz praised uncommitted voters in Minnesota, calling them \u201ccivically engaged\u201d and saying, \u201cThis issue is a humanitarian crisis. They have every right to be heard.\u201d\n\nAnd while Muslims were cautiously optimistic at best, the Harris campaign\u2019s refusal to allow a Palestinian American to speak at the Democratic National Convention last week has soured this hope.\n\nThird-party candidates Jill Stein and Cornel West have both been vocal in their support for the people of Gaza. West chose Melina Abdullah, a Black Muslim woman as his running mate. Stein chose Muslim activist and academic Rudolph \u201cButch\u201d Ware.\n\nEven Republican candidate Donald Trump\u2019s campaign is reaching out to Arab American voters \u2013 a surprise given the anti-Muslim rhetoric he used when campaigning in 2016. People associated with his campaign have been trying to woo Arab voters in swing states. Trump\u2019s youngest daughter, Tiffany, married the son of a Lebanese American businessman, Massad Boulous, who has been trying to persuade Arabs in Michigan to vote for the former president due to the current administration\u2019s failed policy in Gaza.\n\nThe Muslim community\u2019s mobilisation on Palestine has come at a heavy cost for many. The Council on American Islamic Relations reported an unprecedented spike in incidents of bias: a 56 percent increase in reports of Islamophobia in 2023. Anti-Palestinian racism has also skyrocketed, a worrying trend reflected in the shooting of three Palestinian students in Vermont who were wearing the keffiyeh scarf. Thousands \u2013 many of them Muslim students \u2013 were arrested at campus protests, and many were threatened with expulsion or faced criminal charges for their pro-Palestinian activism at colleges and universities across the US.\n\nAnd yet even with the consequences of taking a public stance on Palestine, Muslim voters appear to be undeterred this time around. Solidarity with the people of Gaza has emerged as the single most important issue for American Muslim voters, a group no candidate can afford to ignore.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the authors\u2019 own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera\u2019s editorial stance.",

        "text": "Kamala Harris banks on hunger for change, with few policy details\nKamala Harris campaign is light on policy - but that's helped her transform the race\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe month since Kamala Harris launched her presidential campaign has been a largely unprecedented spell in American politics: never has a modern general election campaign gone from a standstill to a full sprint so quickly. In that time Democrats pulled together a well-scripted national convention with slickly produced promotional videos, political set-pieces and musical interludes, all done to boost the new nominee. It was a remarkable test of skill by party operatives under extreme pressure. Over the course of four days in Chicago \u2013 and in the packed campaign rallies Ms Harris has held over the past few weeks \u2013 the outlines of her campaign strategy have begun to take shape. And it\u2019s not exactly what one would expect from a sitting vice-president who has occupied an office in the White House for three-and-a-half-years. Ms Harris is pushing hard to be viewed as the candidate of change in this race. One who, as she said in her convention speech on Thursday, can \"chart a new way forward\". This strategy is in part born out of necessity. Across the globe democracies have been roiled by voter unrest. As economies struggle to recover from the Covid pandemic, regional conflicts churn and tensions over immigration flare up, political incumbents have faced deeply unhappy electorates in Canada, the UK, Germany and India among others. Polling indicated that President Joe Biden, before he abandoned his re-election campaign last month, was set to confront similar challenges. The vice-president has turned this situation on its head. Her background and personal story is a sharp contrast with both the current president and her Republican opponent. It also helps that Ms Harris is running against a former president who, while also styling himself as a change candidate, has his own sometimes controversial, sometimes unpopular White House record to defend. \u201cThis election, I do strongly believe, is about two very different visions for the future,\u201d Ms Harris said at a rally in North Carolina last week. \u201cOurs focused on the future, and the other focused on the past.\u201d\n\nKamala Harris accepts Democratic nomination 'on behalf of the people'\n\nWhy vagueness might suit Harris\n\nFor the most part, Ms Harris has shied away from describing in detail what her presidency would look like. There\u2019s talk of unity and a way beyond America\u2019s divisive partisanship; a focus on strengthening the economy and reducing consumer prices; and a heavy emphasis on reproductive rights and abortion \u2013 an area of particular strength for Democrats. But it is vague. And this vagueness may suit the Harris campaign just fine. By largely being an empty policy vessel, Ms Harris has allowed various constituencies within the Democratic Party to project their hopes and priorities onto her. If she can keep all those pieces together for the next few months, she might just win.\n\nLabour leaders expressed optimism that she would focus on union protections and bread-and-butter economic issues. Climate activists touted the Biden administration\u2019s clean energy legislation and expected the candidate to expand that effort. Civil rights leaders predicted the first woman of colour to win a major party nomination would advance racial equality. \u201cThe fundamental question people ask is, are you fighting for me, or are you fighting for someone else?\u201d said Tom Perez, who served as secretary of labour in the Obama administration and has been an adviser to the Biden White House. \"I think people have a pretty clear sense that she's a fighter for everyone, not just certain people in certain zip codes or certain tax brackets, not just people of certain races or ethnicities, but everyone.\" In other words, the vice-president\u2019s policy vagueness has allowed her to cast as broad an appeal as possible in what is shaping up to be an election where every undecided voter counts. It has been labelled by some as a \"vibe\" campaign - based at least in part on feeling and general impressions. On Wednesday, former television host, author and international celebrity Oprah Winfrey, who identified herself as a political independent, said Ms Harris and her running mate Tim Walz were the candidates who would deliver \u201cdecency and respect\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m calling on all you independents and all you undecideds,\u201d she said. \u201cValues and character matter most of all, in leadership and in life.\u201d\n\nWhat young Democrats want from Kamala Harris if she wins\n\nThroughout the week, a parade of Republicans \u2013 including former officeholders and Donald Trump supporters \u2013 also took the stage at the convention to pitch Harris as the best option in November. \u201cHarris will want to be centre-left, not far-left,\u201d said Chris Shays, a former Republican congressman from Connecticut who attended the Democratic Convention this year. According to Mr Shays, the vice-president will be pulled to the American political middle because that is where the nation is. Ms Harris\u2019s strategy is not without risk, however. Just as Democratic groups are projecting their ideas onto the vice-president\u2019s campaign, so are her Republican opponents. And they are using Ms Harris\u2019s past, more liberal \u2013 and sometimes controversial \u2013 positions and statements as evidence that the lack of specificity is merely a cover for a left-wing agenda. \u201cHer speech was the perfect example of what happens when you have no solutions to offer for the problems you've delivered to Americans' doorsteps, so you gaslight and deflect,\u201d the Trump campaign said in a statement responding to the vice-president\u2019s convention address. Ms Harris has also avoided sweeping press conferences and more pointed interviews with mainstream media outlets so far \u2013 interviews that could hold her to account for past positions and press her for further policy details. Her speech last week addressing the economy was one of the few instances where the vice-president unveiled concrete new proposals.\n\nMore on US election\n\nWatch on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) Who Is Kamala Harris?\n\nBut over the past four days some nuggets of how she would govern have emerged. She has proposed a $25,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers. She pledged to use the power of government to reduce the cost of prescription drugs and punish price-gouging for groceries. She backed bipartisan immigration legislation that was blocked in the Senate earlier this year. Ms Harris also pledged to push for a federal law that would guarantee a basic right to abortion across the entire US, pre-empting conservative state bans. For some Democrats the details so far aren\u2019t enough. \u201cWe need to hear some actual policy things,\u201d said Lewanna Tucker, chair of the Democratic Party in Fulton County, Georgia. \u201cShe needs to be letting us a little bit more behind the curtain and talk about structural things that are going to be done.\u201d Perhaps more concrete policy details aren't necessary. At a time when American politics is viewed by much of the American public as divisive and toxic, there may be benefit to building a political campaign not around policy specifics, but rather one that appeals to emotion. In 2008, Barack Obama successfully campaigned on hope and change \u2013 which is not exactly the makings of a four-point plan. \u201cIt's a return to a level of hope that I don't think that we have collectively experienced since 2008,\u201d said Yasmin Radjy, who runs the liberal grassroots organising group Swing Left. She said there had been an exhaustion among volunteers on the left for the past eight years, but the switch to Ms Harris was \u201clike a weight had lifted off their shoulders\".",

        "text": "RFK Jr ends US presidential campaign, endorses Trump\nPhoto: REBECCA NOBLE / AFP\n\nIndependent presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr abandoned his campaign on Friday and endorsed Republican Donald Trump, ending a run that he began as a Democrat trading on one of the most famous names in American politics.\n\nHours after announcing the endorsement in a press conference, Kennedy joined Trump at a campaign event in Arizona, where the crowd cheered the independent loudly.\n\n\"His candidacy has inspired millions and millions of Americans, raised critical issues that have been too long ignored in this country,\" Trump said of Kennedy.\n\nStrategists said it was unclear whether Kennedy's endorsement would help Trump, who was in a tight contest with Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of the 5 November election.\n\nKennedy, 70, told a news conference earlier that he met with Trump and his aides several times and learned they agreed on issues like border security, free speech and ending wars.\n\n\"There are still many issues and approaches on which we continue to have very serious differences. But we are aligned on other key issues,\" he told reporters.\n\nHe reiterated much of that when he joined Trump at the Arizona rally and repeated positions on his core issues of combating chronic illness and ridding the environment and food supply of hazardous chemicals.\n\nWith Kennedy on stage, the former president said that if he regained the White House, he would create a presidential commission on assassination attempts and release files related to the assassination of President John F Kennedy in 1963.\n\nRobert Kennedy, known by his initials RFK Jr, said he would remove his name from ballots in 10 battleground states likely to determine the outcome of the election and remain as a candidate in other states.\n\nAn environmental lawyer, anti-vaccine activist and son and nephew of two titans of Democratic politics who were assassinated during the turbulent 1960s, Kennedy entered the race in April 2023 as a challenger to President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination.\n\nWith some voters at the time turned off by both the aging Biden and the legally embattled Trump, interest in Kennedy soared. He later decided to run as an independent, and a November 2023 Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Kennedy with 20 percent support in a three-way race with Biden and Trump.\n\nHe ran a high-profile advertisement during the February 2024 Super Bowl that invoked his father, US Senator Robert F Kennedy, and uncle, President Kennedy, and drew outrage from much of his high-profile family.\n\nPhoto: Olivier Touron / AFP\n\nHis sister Kerry Kennedy said on Friday that his decision to endorse Trump betrayed the family's values. \"It is a sad ending to a sad story,\" she said on social media.\n\nFor a time, both the Biden and Trump campaigns showed signs they were worried that Kennedy could draw enough support to change the election outcome.\n\nBut as the race changed quickly in the last two months - with Trump surviving an assassination attempt and the 81-year-old Biden bowing to pressure from his own party and passing the campaign torch to Harris - voter interest in Kennedy waned.\n\nAn Ipsos poll this month showed his national support had fallen to 4 percent, a tiny number but one that could still be meaningful in a tight race such as the current Trump-Harris matchup.\n\nDemocrats shrugged off Friday's announcement.\n\n\"Donald Trump isn't earning an endorsement that's going to help build support, he's inheriting the baggage of a failed fringe candidate. Good riddance,\" Democratic National Committee senior adviser Mary Beth Cahill said in a statement.\n\nDrexel University political science professor William Rosenberg said the move was unlikely to have an impact on the race, given Kennedy's low poll numbers.\n\nTrump pollster Tony Fabrizio argued that more of Kennedy's supporters would back Trump than Harris in battleground states. \"This is good news for President Trump and his campaign,\" he wrote in a memo.\n\nIn exchange for endorsing Trump, Kennedy was hoping for a job in a potential Trump administration, a super PAC supporting Kennedy told Reuters on Wednesday.\n\nKennedy painted himself as a political outsider. He told Reuters in an interview in March that if elected president he would repeal many provisions of Biden's signature Inflation Reduction Act and would seek to close down the southern border to immigrants entering the US illegally. He also offered staunch support for Israel.\n\nBear, brain worms\n\nKennedy said this month in a video posted online that he dumped a dead bear in New York City's Central Park a decade ago and staged it to look like a bike had hit it. He proclaimed he had \"so many skeletons in my closet\" after a former family babysitter accused him of sexual assault. He denied that a picture of him posing with the barbecued carcass of a large animal belonged to a canine.\n\nAnd then there was the brain worm. Kennedy's campaign confirmed that he had a parasite in his brain more than a decade ago, but has since fully recovered, drawing widespread ridicule.\n\n- Reuters",

        "text": "If Australians could vote for either Kamala Harris or Donald Trump, the result would be a landslide, says survey\n\"Kamala is ready. The question is: Are we?\"\n\nThat was the question the governor of North Carolina Roy Cooper posed ahead of a speech by Kamala Harris on the last night of the Democratic National Convention.\n\nInside the final day of the Democratic Convention Photo shows A woman points in front of a crowd After weeks of turmoil and President Joe Biden's historic decision to step aside, Kamala Harris has made her pitch to the American people to vote for her over Donald Trump. Here's what you missed.\n\nThe \"we\" was addressed, of course, to the American voting public who are deeply polarised over their choice despite a surge of momentum towards US Vice-President Harris, who is now officially the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nBut if we had been asked about us, Australians living in a middle power aligned so closely to the United States and obsessively watching this show as if it were a Hollywood blockbuster, the answer would have been an unequivocal yes.\n\nHarris's campaign HQ is calling for a \"Femininomenon\" at the polls this November, using the hit song from Chappell Roan in a meme that's flooded the internet. And it looks like Australia \u2014 with no woman candidate in sight for PM \u2014 has joined the Femininomenon in the US. We have been quietly having our own brat winter.\n\nNew polling conducted by consultant and pollsters Talbot Mills Research has found Australians \u2014 who won't get a vote in November \u2014 are overwhelmingly ready to elect Kamala Harris.\n\nEven Coalition voters prefer Kamala Harris in Australia to Donald Trump. That's right, centre-right voters in our country prefer Harris.\n\nWho would Australians vote for?\n\nIf Australian voters decided the US presidential election, Kamala Harris would easily beat Donald Trump by 48 per cent to 27 per cent.\n\nNow to be clear, winning the popular vote wouldn't necessarily determine the outcome. Most US experts argue a popular vote of 30 per cent is about as low as you could go. But some have claimed even lower percentages were possible.\n\nDavid Talbot, director of Talbot Mills Research which is ANACTA Group's research partner, served as pollster and strategist for New Zealand's last two Labour prime ministers, Jacinda Ardern and Chris Hipkins. In Australia, he was involved in Labor's successful campaigns in the 2022 federal election and the Victorian state election.\n\nHe said in Australia, the support for Harris is very high.\n\n\"Australians have taken warmly to Kamala Harris. Even Coalition voters prefer Harris to Trump by 43 per cent to 37 per cent,\" Talbot told this column.\n\nLast month, a poll conducted by the same firm investigated voter opinions of Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Biden (30 per cent) was barely ahead of Trump (28 per cent).\n\nBy vote, Greens (58 per cent to 17 per cent) and Labor (59 per cent to 22 per cent) strongly favoured Harris over Trump.\n\nIt was a tighter contest amongst Coalition voters, who favoured Harris by 43 per cent to 37 per cent over Trump.\n\nPauline Hanson One Nation voters broke decisively (58 per cent to 18 per cent) for Trump.\n\n\"We also saw a decided gender gap with men more likely to support Trump and women Harris,\" Talbot said.\n\nThis gender difference is consistent in the United States, too. In fact, I've previously written about the gender voting gap, which sees women voting increasingly to the left and men to the right.\n\nThe question in the survey of 1,000 Australians was: If you were eligible to vote in the American election, who would you vote for?\n\nThe US is important to Australia and we will have to deal with the consequences of the result, so the purpose of a poll like this was to assess attitudes of Australians toward the two US presidential candidates.\n\nBiden was favoured by one voter group in the US\n\nAnacta's co-founder David Nelson, who travelled to Chicago for last week's Democratic National Convention after working on the successful UK Labour campaign, says Harris has achieved an incredible level of energy and consolidation of support.\n\nBut he says it's still unclear if that support will be sufficient to win her the presidency.\n\nHarris's gains to date are with the progressive base that had become disinterested because of Biden's age.\n\nABC Politics in your inbox Photo shows Politics journalist Brett Worthington on a black backgournd Sign up to the ABC Politics newsletter with Brett Worthington\n\nThere are concerns Harris is not making gains with independents (people registered to vote but not registered with a party), where President Biden was stronger.\n\n\"That said, in the private conversations we were having, strategists are conscious that the race is still essentially a toss-up in the battleground states,\" he says. \"They know the challenge for Harris's campaign will be to take that energy and pivot it to a conversation with suburban voters, especially women, who voted for Trump in 2016 and are still open to voting him this time\".\n\nIn Australia, polling suggests that for the majority of Australians the answer is obvious. But that isn't necessarily so in the US, Nelson says.\n\n\"It remains to be seen if Kamala Harris can demonstrate she shares their values, and will be better for their families, at a time where they're still suffering a cost-of-living crisis they observed as beginning under President Biden,\" he says.\n\nAnd while Donald Trump's numbers are much lower in Australia, he has a base of support that demonstrates Australia is not immune from right-wing populist appeal.\n\nThe truth is that Australia has yet to see a right-wing populist leader emerge that breaks with convention and traditional right-wing rhetoric to challenge the status quo.\n\nLoading\n\nBuckle up\n\nPolitics is increasingly wild, in Australia as well as in the US.\n\nThis weekend in Australia we had a tiny election by worldwide standards in the Northern Territory \u2014 a huge swing against the incumbent Labor government (although expected and probably not as bad as it might have been a year ago) has seen the ALP smashed and denominated.\n\nThe Party Room Want to know what's really going on in Parliament House? Fran Kelly and Patricia Karvelas give you the political analysis that matters and explain what it means for you.\n\nThat volatility wasn't predicted \u2014 although it does speak to the underlying anger over cost-of-living pressures and crime. What it also reveals is that voters are ready to act on frustrations. It's an ominous warning for federal Labor.\n\nBack in the US \u2014 after Trump survived an assassination attempt and Biden was still the Democratic nominee, practically every analyst declared Trump the inevitable winner of the US election that was at the time still months away.\n\nNow, Harris has up-ended that dynamic.\n\nBut the concerns of Americans on immigration and cost of living will ultimately dominate.\n\nAnd anyone who tells you where the result will land is lying.\n\nLiterally anything could happen. So buckle up.\n\nPatricia Karvelas is the presenter of RN Breakfast and co-host of the Party Room podcast. She also hosts Q+A, which returns on ABC TV in August.",

        "text": "The Political Values of Harris and Trump Supporters\nThis spring, Pew Research Center conducted a major study of American political values. This survey examined the public\u2019s views of topics including immigration, race and ethnicity, government, family, gender identity, religious values, and foreign policy. Reports released earlier this year looked at these attitudes among supporters of President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump \u2013 then the likely major-party nominees for president.\n\nBecause the Pew Research Center interviews the same adults over time using the online American Trends Panel, for this analysis we are able to link respondents\u2019 voter preferences across multiple surveys. As a result, we can analyze results from the spring survey by vote preferences collected in a more recent August survey \u2013 when we asked voters about their preference in the presidential contest between Donald Trump, Kamala Harris and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nThis analysis uses responses from 4,527 registered voters who took both surveys. The values survey was conducted April 8-14, 2024. The vote preference survey (support if the presidential election were held today) was conducted Aug. 5-11, 2024.\n\nEveryone who took part in these surveys is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), a group of people recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses who have agreed to take surveys regularly. This kind of recruitment gives nearly all U.S. adults a chance of selection. Surveys were conducted either online or by telephone with a live interviewer. The results are weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other factors. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology.\n\nThe questions used for this analysis are drawn from previously published surveys. Refer to the toplines from the following publications for question wording of the political values items: Cultural Issues and the 2024 Election, Americans\u2019 Views of Government\u2019s Role: Persistent Divisions and Areas of Agreement, Views on America\u2019s global role diverge widely by age and party. Refer to Harris Energizes Democrats in Transformed Presidential Race for vote preference question wording.\n\nHere is the survey methodology for this analysis.",

        "text": "Ex-Democrat Tulsi Gabbard endorses Donald Trump in 2024 presidential race\nTulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman, has endorsed the Republican nominee, Donald Trump, in the US presidential election.\n\nGabbard, who served in the military in Iraq, ran for president in the Democratic primary in 2020. She quit the party two years later and has become a fixture at conservative conferences and in rightwing media.\n\nAddressing a National Guard Association conference in Detroit, Michigan, where Trump was speaking, Gabbard said: \u201cThis administration has us facing multiple wars on multiple fronts in regions around the world and closer to the brink of nuclear war than we ever have been before.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the main reasons why I\u2019m committed to doing all that I can to send President Trump back to the White House, where he can once again serve us as our commander-in-chief. Because I am confident that his first task will be to do the work to walk us back from the brink of war.\u201d\n\nGabbard, who represented Hawaii in Congress and is a former vice-chair of the Democratic National Committee, accused the Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris, of retaliating against political opponents, undermining civil liberties and weaponising America\u2019s institutions against both Trump and herself.\n\n\u201cWe as Americans must stand together to reject this anti-freedom culture of political retaliation and abuse of power,\u201d she added.\n\nGabbard\u2019s announcement comes a day after Robert F Kennedy Jr, scion of a Democratic dynasty, suspended his own White House bid and threw his weight behind Trump. Elon Musk, who describes himself as \u201chistorically a moderate Democrat\u201d, is also backing the former president.\n\nDemocrats dismissed Gabbard\u2019s endorsement. Alex Floyd, rapid response director for the Democratic National Committee, said: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s Maga brand is so toxic that he\u2019s resorted to touting support from off-putting extremists like RFK Jr and Tulsi Gabbard. Gabbard and Trump have a lot in common \u2013 they have both earned the praises of white supremacists and other extremists, celebrated the overturning of Roe v Wade and campaigned for dangerous election deniers.\u201d\n\nTrump, who has been portraying Harris as a leftwing extremist, told the gathering on Monday: \u201cThis fight is no longer between Democrats and Republicans. This is a fight between communism and freedom.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very serious fight. That\u2019s why millions of traditional Democrats, including FDR Democrats, JFK Democrats, independents and old-fashioned liberals are joining our movement. Our poll numbers are great.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She loves our country and she loves the people in this room.\u201d\n\nRecently Gabbard has been helping Trump prepare for next month\u2019s televised presidential debate against Harris. In 2020 she took Harris to task on the debate stage over her record as a prosecutor \u2013 a clip that still circulates in rightwing media.\n\nTrump, who earlier laid wreaths during a ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, was marking the third anniversary of a suicide bombing that killed 13 US service members during the withdrawal from Afghanistan. \u201cThe humiliation in Afghanistan set off the collapse of American credibility and respect all around the world,\u201d he said in Detroit, seeking to blame Harris and Joe Biden for the deaths.\n\nIn her own statement marking the anniversary of the Kabul airport attack, Harris said she mourns the 13 service members who were killed. \u201cMy prayers are with their families and loved ones,\u201d she added. \u201cMy heart breaks for their pain and their loss.\u201d",

Their message is one that was heard from many speakers at the Democrats\u2019 convention last week: this is a close race, and don\u2019t become irrationally exuberant.\n\nNPR\u2019s analysis now has all seven of the most closely watched swing states as toss-ups, moving all of the Sun Belt states from Lean Republican previously. NPR\u2019s analysis in this map is not based strictly on polling, but also on historical trends and conversations with campaigns and party strategists.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn a map based strictly on the polls, Harris is now exactly at 270, the number needed to win.\n\nFor the state polling, NPR's analysis is based on an average of surveys aggregated by FiveThirtyEight and The Hill/DDHQ . If a candidate has a lead of 1 percentage point or more in an average of the two, then the state is marked as red or blue. If the margin is tighter than 1 point, then it is marked as a pure Toss-Up.\n\nLoading...\n\nHarris has now taken a consistent, though narrow lead in the Blue Wall states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. She holds an average lead of about 3 points in Wisconsin and Michigan, but only 1 point in Pennsylvania, where both campaigns are spending the most.\n\nIn the Sun Belt, former President Donald Trump holds an almost 2-point lead in Georgia, and it is within 1 point in each of the other three: North Carolina, Nevada and Arizona.\n\nThat\u2019s about as tight as it can get and should be no solace to either campaign, as the debates approach and early voting is just weeks away.",

        "text": "Ask an expert: Climate, weather and energy in the 2024 presidential election\nQ: What are some of the impacts of climate change that may affect our communities? What can be done to prepare for climate-driven disasters like forest fires, drought, flooding, etc.?\n\nErica Smithwick is a Distinguished Professor of Geography at Penn State. She is a landscape and ecosystem ecologist and serves as the director of Penn State\u2019s Earth and Environmental Systems Institute and associate director of the Institute of Energy and the Environment. Smithwick leads the Penn State Climate Consortium that brings together interdisciplinary researchers in partnership with society to innovate climate solutions.\n\nSmithwick: Unnatural disasters are becoming the norm. Extreme weather is about 10 times more likely now than in the past and each year seems to be worse than the one before. Unhealthy air from wildfire smoke, heat waves, droughts, floods and more intense storms are more common because of climate change. The good news is that every degree of warming we prevent by reducing our emissions will reduce the chances these extremes get even worse, so combatting greenhouse gas emissions remains a top priority. However, we also need to be prepared to support communities grappling with unnatural, extreme events. For example, in the case of wildfire, this means new considerations about building in fire prone areas, increased awareness and education about fire dangers and preparedness, and putting beneficial fire back on the landscape in ways that promote healthy habitats and reduce fire risk. We also need to be aware that wildfire smoke has damaging health impacts, especially on children and vulnerable populations, so minimizing smoke exposure is critical.\n\nStempel: Coastal communities are seeing real impacts now. We\u2019re talking about athletic fields turning into marshes, sewer systems that are failing, beaches becoming too small to sit on, or water infiltrating into water supply systems and causing treatment failures. These things affect people\u2019s lives and livelihoods in profound ways, and often stress budgets and our capacity to respond to disasters when they do happen.\n\nAddressing these impacts involves tradeoffs. Saving the beach that drives the tourist economy may mean letting it migrate inland and having to move buildings. The best thing we can do for communities is to help them connect the dots and understand how local impacts are connected to larger changes so they can weigh the tradeoffs and make smart decisions. For instance, increasing rainwater infiltration may help reduce the impact of saltwater intrusion contaminating drinking water wells and solve both a drainage problem and a water treatment problem.\n\nQ: Who is at risk of being displaced by disasters resulting from climate change? How can communities prepare to handle climate refugees when disasters happen?\n\nStempel: Anyone can be displaced. We often don\u2019t talk enough about the diversity of people who are displaced because people with enough resources may assimilate into new communities and secure better housing than people with less resources. Those most vulnerable to getting stuck in portable temporary housing or becoming unhoused are those people who are already economically disadvantaged or in substandard housing. The best thing we can do pre- or post-disaster is help people find secure housing and transportation that allows them to apply their skills and talents to thrive. Being productive and contributing to communities can also be a very important part of psychological health and healing after disaster. It would be even better if we could keep communities of faith or neighborhoods together when they are displaced. Fundamentally, this means we invest in housing and transportation now and create policies that make building or converting existing buildings to housing practical.\n\nQ: What solutions can we pursue today to mitigate risks and adapt to the effects of climate change?\n\nSmithwick: Talk about it. We know that most people care about what's happening, but they aren't talking about it with their friends and neighbors. It's time to engage in these conversations so that we can identify ways to support our communities. And the good news is that we do have solutions. Cutting edge advancements in batteries, renewable energy technologies, resilient building design, sustainable materials, climate finance and more are being developed right now. Deployment of the solutions, at the scale needed to address the challenge, is the real issue and this will take an \"all hands-on deck\" approach. Recent incentives, such as the Inflation Reduction Act and related investments in community-focused research and application are examples of how resources can be redirected to support climate innovation and resilience.\n\nStempel: We need to talk to one another. In my work on coastal adaptation, I meet many people who are seeing and experiencing climate impacts now. Even if they think differently than I do, they can see the tangible effects of climate change. This opens people to conversations that until recently were unthinkable. My perception is that there is a growing majority of people who are prepared to act in some way, but the fear of being attacked or ostracized by a social group still holds them back from speaking. We need to make reasonable people feel comfortable enough to engage. Those of us promoting adaptation and mitigation need to be open to the idea that the solutions we might prefer may not be the best for a particular community, just as communities need to come to terms with the fact that universal protection is not feasible or advisable. Nothing substantial can happen until we make space for a meaningful conversation and listen to one another.\n\nFor more information or to speak with one of our election experts, contact mediarelations@psu.edu.",

        "text": "Future of Trump-Harris debate uncertain as campaigns quibble over details\nThe two US presidential campaigns have issues with the anticipated September 10 showdown.\n\nThe status of an anticipated debate between US presidential candidates Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris is up in the air as the two campaigns squabble over details.\n\nOn Monday, the Harris campaign said the dispute centres over whether microphones will be muted while the other candidate is speaking, a feature meant to decrease interruptions and employed during an earlier debate between former President Trump and then-candidate and current President Joe Biden.\n\nThe Harris campaign now wants to see that feature reversed. Trump has also accused ABC News, the network hosting the September 10 debate, of bias against him.\n\n\u201cI ask, why would I do the Debate against Kamala Harris on that network?\u201d Trump said in a social media post on Sunday.\n\nThe microphone-muting feature was a condition previously established by the Biden campaign, which believed it would limit Trump from his typical outbursts on stage and allow for a smoother event.\n\nBiden suspended his bid for a second term last month after a disastrous debate performance against Trump in June that underscored concerns over his age and cognitive state. The Democratic Party rallied around Harris as its new candidate for the November 5 election soon thereafter.\n\nThe Harris campaign is now fighting to reverse the microphone rule, believing that it helped Trump by making him appear more disciplined than he really is and denying viewers the chance to make an honest assessment of his temperament.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s handlers prefer the muted microphone because they don\u2019t think their candidate can act presidential for 90 minutes on his own,\u201d Harris campaign spokesperson Brian Fallon said in a statement on Monday.\n\nFallon added that the Democratic candidate is \u201cready to deal with Trump\u2019s constant lies and interruptions in real time. Trump should stop hiding behind the mute button.\u201d\n\nTrump spokesman Jason Miller responded that the two candidates agreed to the September 10 debate under the same rules as the Biden-Trump debate in June.\n\n\u201cKamala refuses to do Interviews, because she has NO CONFIDENCE in her own level of \u2018Intelligence,\u2019 and now wants to change the Rules of the Debate on ABC Fake News!\u201d Trump said on his social media website Truth Social on Monday.",

Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning author and presidential historian Jon Meacham and Vanderbilt professor, polling expert and political scientist John Geer will blend history and political science to offer relevant context and insights about this fascinating election and point out ways it is and is not unprecedented.\n\nThey seek to have an evidence-based conversation, avoiding partisanship and the tendency of far too many political observers to lead with their ideological chins, that is, to be contentious instead of open-minded. \u201cLooking over the long span of American history, one thing is clear: no one party or ideological approach has all the answers,\u201d Geer said. \u201cIn fact, America is at its best when both sides make their case, and we let the public decide which side should govern for the next few years. This competitive struggle allows our country to work imperfectly toward being that perfect union.\u201d\n\nThis four-part podcast will blend history and political science to offer insights, provide context and show how this electoral battle fits into the long arc of American history.\n\nThe series will premiere Aug. 28. There will be editions in September and October, then a concluding session that assesses the results and implications of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nThe podcast will be available on the following platforms:\n\nJon Meacham, co-chair of the Vanderbilt Project on Unity and American Democracy, Distinguished Visiting Professor of Political Science and Carolyn T. and Robert M. Rogers Chair in American Presidency, is a renowned presidential historian, contributing writer to The New York Times Book Review, contributing editor at Time magazine and a Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning author.\n\nJohn Geer, Distinguished Professor of Political Science and the Gertrude Conaway Vanderbilt Chair, leads the Vanderbilt Project on Unity and American Democracy, is co-director of the Vanderbilt Poll, and serves as a senior advisor to Chancellor Daniel Diermeier on vital strategic initiatives promoting democracy and open dialogue.\n\nGeer and Meacham are co-teaching an Elections 2024 course this fall with professors Nicole Hemmer and Josh Clinton. This class is the largest in-person elective class in the history of the university, with 1,100 students enrolled and a waiting list of about 100.",

However, things have started to take a turn in favor of the Democratic Party right after Kamala Harris joined their ticket for the US poll 2024.Before and after the Democratic National Convention 2024, Kamala Harris has shown some amazing trends going in her favor, and the latest poll survey by Fairleigh Dickinson University, conducted nationally, reveals that she is ahead of Trump by a whopping 7 points, which is great news for the Democrats, but also a warning bell for the Republicans, who have appeared to become quite over-confident in the recent months after Biden's exit from the poll race.Kamala Harris has been seen gaining the support from different races and gender, and Trump seems to lose the edge whenever these factors come into play during electoral surveys.Meanwhile, stats reveal that Donald Trump is gaining solid support from the Conservatives, who form a major share of his vote bank. The Hill's report reveals that the former US President has garnered a massive amount of support from men with masculine identities, majorly white. In some instances, this could be seen as a good sign, but once you look at the bigger picture, there is a major problem as Harris majorly dominates in all other electoral aspects, as per the latest surveys.Even though the surveys conducted in recent weeks portray a different picture than what Republicans imagined a few weeks ago, Trump is still confident and has claimed that he is already getting the support of Hispanic voters, black men and women, whose primary priority is safety.There are chances that former US President Donald Trump could be defeated by his Democrat rival Kamala Harris, based on recent survey data on a national level.Kamala Harris, based on national survey data from multiple polls, is getting the support of most races and genders, and also has a fair share of support from Hispanic voters.",

        "text": "Trump Harris debate: Campaigns spar over muting microphones\nTrump and Harris spar over muting debate microphones\n\nUS Election: 'ABC is a disgrace' - Trump on the looming debate\n\nThe Donald Trump and Kamala Harris campaigns are sparring over whether to mute one of the microphones when it is the other person's turn to speak during the pair's scheduled debate next month. The Harris campaign said in a statement to the BBC's US partner CBS News that it wanted both candidates\u2019 microphones to be live throughout the full broadcast. The Trump campaign reportedly wants the ABC debate, scheduled for 10 September, to be governed by the same rules agreed when Joe Biden was the Democratic candidate. That would mean the microphones being muted. The apparent impasse comes as the former president questioned the impartiality of the network and signalled he might even skip the debate.\n\nBefore President Joe Biden stepped down as the Democratic party nominee, his campaign agreed with Trump's campaign to participate in two debates - one previously held in June on CNN and one to air on ABC News this September. The Biden campaign negotiated the rules for the debate and agreed that the microphone would be muted when a candidate wasn't speaking. The Trump campaign agreed to the rule, which was enforced during the June CNN debate. But now, with just 15 days until the ABC News debate in Philadelphia is scheduled to air, the Harris campaign wants the microphones to be \"hot\" - meaning they will never be turned off for the duration of the debate. This would allow the two candidates to interrupt and speak over each other on the debate stage. \"The vice president is ready to deal with Trump\u2019s constant lies and interruptions in real time. Trump should stop hiding behind the mute button,\" Harris campaign senior communications adviser Brian Fallon said in a statement.\n\nWhat young Democrats want from Kamala Harris if she wins\n\nTrump, meanwhile, told reporters on Monday that he'd rather have the microphones on during the debate, but said it \"worked out fine\" when they were muted on stage with Mr Biden. \"We agreed to the same rules and same specifications and I think that's probably what it should be, but they're trying to change it,\" he said. \"The truth is they're trying to get out of it because she doesn't want to debate. She's not a good debater.\" Trump's campaign, in a statement to Politico, reiterated the former president's accusation that Ms Harris was looking to find a way to get out of the debate. \u201cEnough with the games. We accepted the ABC debate under the exact same terms as the CNN debate,\" senior Trump adviser Jason Miller told Politico. \"The Harris camp, after having already agreed to the CNN rules, asked for a seated debate, with notes, and opening statements. We said no changes to the agreed upon rules.\u201d A Harris campaign official who was asked about the Trump campaign's claims said they were \"100% false\", according to CBS News. On Trump's Truth Social platform on Sunday, he questioned whether the ABC News journalists moderating the debate would give the questions to the Harris campaign ahead of time. \"Why would I do the debate against Kamala Harris on that network?\" he wrote. This is not the first time the former president has suggested he could back out of a debate. Earlier this month, Trump said he would only debate Ms Harris if the debate was hosted by Fox News. He reversed course several days later. Meanwhile, as the 5 November election nears, the Harris campaign said it has raised $540 million since Biden stepped down, the Associated Press reports. Harris saw record-breaking fundraising numbers in the aftermath of Mr Biden dropping out of the race. The Trump campaign, on the other hand, raised $138.7 million in July and has $327 million cash on hand.",

This shift was driven by major news networks that, for the first time, used these colors consistently on electoral maps, transforming how Americans visualize their political landscape. However, this color association was not always the norm, and its adoption reflects a broader evolution in the representation of political identities.Historically, the use of red and blue to represent political parties in the United States was inconsistent.In 1976, NBC introduced its first on-air election map, using red to designate states won by Democratic nominee Jimmy Carter and blue for states won by Republican nominee Gerald Ford. This color scheme was inspired by the British political system, where the liberal party is traditionally associated with blue, as noted by The Verge.Some networks used red to represent Democrats and blue for Republicans, reflecting earlier practices where color assignments were made arbitrarily or based on regional preferences.In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, political parties in South Texas even used color-coded ballots\u2014red for Republicans and blue for Democrats\u2014to assist illiterate or non-English-speaking voters. However, these practices were often associated with election fraud, as noted by the Texas State Historical Association.The chaotic 2000 presidential election between George W. Bush and Al Gore marked a significant turning point in the use of political colors in the U.S. As the election dragged on, with the results hinging on a contentious recount in Florida, major news networks like The New York Times and USA Today sought to simplify the reporting process by consistently using red for Republicans and blue for Democrats on their electoral maps.According to Archie Tse, a senior graphics editor at The New York Times, the decision to use red for Republicans and blue for Democrats was somewhat arbitrary. He explained, \"Red begins with r, Republican begins with r. It was a more natural association.\" This choice was embraced by other media outlets, leading to a unified approach that helped reduce confusion during the protracted electoral process.The consistency in color usage was crucial during the weeks-long recount and legal battles, ultimately culminating in George W. Bush being declared the winner. By the time the election was decided, the color associations had become deeply ingrained in the public consciousness.Since the 2000 election, red and blue have become synonymous with the Republican and Democratic parties, respectively. These colors are now central to political branding, with slogans like \"Vote Blue\" becoming rallying cries for Democratic campaigns. On the Republican side, the color red is prominently featured in campaign materials, most notably in the \"Make America Great Again\" hats worn by supporters of former President Donald Trump.The color-coding extends beyond election maps and into the broader cultural and political landscape, shaping how Americans identify with their chosen parties. The adoption of these colors has created a visual shorthand that instantly communicates party affiliation, a significant departure from the previous decades' more fluid and varied color use.The U.S. approach to political color-coding stands in contrast to the practices of many other countries, where red is typically associated with left-wing or socialist parties, and blue represents conservative or right-wing movements. For example, in the United Kingdom, the Conservative Party uses blue, while the Labour Party is symbolized by red. This difference highlights the unique development of political symbolism in the U.S., where the color associations we now take for granted were not inevitable but rather the result of historical contingencies.The solidification of red for Republicans and blue for Democrats in the U.S. is a legacy of the 2000 presidential election, a moment when media consistency in color-coding became a necessity. This modern political symbolism, now deeply embedded in the American political identity , reflects a significant shift from earlier, more arbitrary practices.",

        "text": "Behind the rhetoric, a presidential campaign is a competition about how to tell the American story\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Kamala Harris accepted the Democratic nomination \u201con behalf of everyone whose story could only be written in the greatest nation on Earth.\u201d America, Barack Obama thundered, \u201cis ready for a better story.\u201d JD Vance insisted that the Biden administration \u201cis not the end of our story,\u201d and Donald Trump called on fellow Republicans to \u201cwrite our own thrilling chapter of the American story.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis week,\u201d comedian and former Obama administration speechwriter Jon Lovett said Thursday on NBC, \u201chas been about a story.\u201d\n\nIn the discourse of American politics, this kind of talk from both sides is unsurprising \u2014 fitting, even. Because in the campaign season of 2024, just as in the fabric of American culture at large, the notion of \u201cstory\u201d is everywhere.\n\nThis year\u2019s political conventions were, like so many of their kind, curated collections of elaborate stories carefully spun to accomplish one goal \u2014 getting elected. But lurking behind them was a pitched, high-stakes battle over how to frame the biggest story of all \u2014 the one about America that, as Harris put it, should be \u201cthe next great chapter in the most extraordinary story ever told.\u201d\n\nThe American story \u2014 an unlikely one, filled with twists that sometimes feel, as so many enjoy saying, \u201cjust like a movie\u201d \u2014 sits at the nucleus of American culture for a unique reason.\n\nAmericans live in one of the only societies that was built not upon hundreds of years of common culture but upon stories themselves \u2014 \u201cthe shining city upon the hill,\u201d \u201clife, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,\u201d \u201call men are created equal.\u201d Even memorable ad campaigns \u2014 \u201dBaseball, hot dogs, apple pie and Chevrolet\u201d \u2014 are part of this. In some ways, the United States \u2014 not coincidentally, the place where the frontier myth, Hollywood and Madison Avenue were all born \u2014 willed itself into existence and significance by iterating and reiterating its story as it went.\n\nThe campaigns understand that. So they are putting forward to voters two varying \u2014 starkly opposite, some might say \u2014 versions of the American story.\n\nHow the two parties are using stories\n\nFrom the Republicans comes one flavor of story: an insistence that to \u201cmake America great again\u201d in the future we must fight to reinvigorate traditional values and reclaim the moral fiber and stoutheartedness of generations past. In his convention speech last month, Trump invoked three separate conflicts \u2014 the Revolutionary War, the Civil War and World War II \u2014 in summoning American history\u2019s glories.\n\nTo reinforce its vision, the GOP deployed the likes of musician Kid Rock, celebrity wrestler Hulk Hogan and Lee Greenwood singing \u201cGod Bless the USA.\u201d Trump genuflected to the firefighting gear of Corey Comperatore, who had been killed in an assassination attempt on the candidate days earlier. Vance spoke of \u201cvillains\u201d and offered up the Appalachian coming-of-age story he told in \u201cHillbilly Elegy.\u201d\n\nThe Republicans, as they often do, leaned into military storylines, bringing forth families of slain servicemen to critique President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cweak\u201d leadership. And they made all efforts to manage their constituencies. Vance\u2019s wife, Usha, who is of Indian descent, lauded him as \u201ca meat-and-potatoes kind of guy\u201d \u2014 a classic American trope \u2014 while underscoring that he respected her vegetarian diet and had learned how to cook Indian food for her mother.\n\n\u201cWhat could I say that hasn\u2019t already been said before?\u201d she said, introducing Vance. \u201cAfter all, the man was already the subject of a Ron Howard movie.\u201d\n\nAnd the Democrats? Their convention last week focused on a new and different future full of \u201cjoy\u201d and free of what Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg called \u201cTrump\u2019s politics of darkness.\u201d It was an implied \u201cStar Wars\u201d metaphor if there ever was one.\n\nIt was hard to miss that the Democrats were not only coalescing around the multiracial, multicultural nation that Harris personifies but at the same time methodically trying to reclaim the plainspoken slivers of the American story that have rested in Republican hands in recent years.\n\nThe flag was everywhere, as was the notion of freedom. Tim Walz entered to the tune of John Mellencamp\u2019s \u201cSmall Town,\u201d an ode to the vision of America that Republicans usually trumpet. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota expounded upon the regular-guy traits that Walz embodies \u2014 someone who can change a car light, a hunter, a \u201cdad in plaid.\u201d\n\nThe former geography teacher\u2019s football-coach history was mined as well, with beefy guys in Mankato West Scarlets jerseys fanning out across the stage to the marching-band strains of \u201cThe Halls of Montezuma.\u201d They even enlisted a former GOP member of Congress to reinforce all the imagery by saying the quiet part loud.\n\n\u201cI want to let my fellow Republicans in on the secret: The Democrats are as patriotic as us,\u201d said Adam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican critical of Trump.\n\nBringing it all together\n\nWatching the videos and testimonials at both conventions, one storytelling technique stood tall: what journalists call \u201ccharacter-driven\u201d tales. Whether it\u2019s advocating for abortion rights or warning about mass illegal immigration or channeling anger about inflation, \u201cregular\u201d Americans became the narrative building blocks for national concerns.\n\nHistorian Heather Cox Richardson put it this way about the DNC in her Substack, \u201cLetters from an American,\u201d this past week: \u201cThe many stories in which ordinary Americans rise from adversity through hard work, decency, and service to others implicitly conflates those individual struggles with the struggles of the United States itself.\u201d\n\nIn the past generation, the tools of storytelling have become more democratic. We are all publishers now \u2014 on X, on TikTok, on Instagram, on Truth Social. And we are all storytellers, telling mini versions of the American story in whatever ways we wish. Perspectives that have been long silenced and suppressed are making their way into the light.\n\nPutting aside questions of truth and misinformation for a moment, how can a unifying American story be summoned when hundreds of millions of people are now able to tell it differently and from their own vantage points? Democratization is beneficial, but it can also be chaotic and hard to understand.\n\n\u201cA people who cannot stand together cannot stand at all,\u201d poet Amanda Gorman said in her remarks at the DNC. But with so many stories to sort through, is unity more difficult than ever? Is there even a single, unifying \u201cAmerican story\u201d at all? Should there be?\n\nIn the end, that\u2019s why this election is about storytelling more than ever. Because the loudest, most persuasive tale \u2014 told slickly with the industrial-strength communications tools of the 21st century \u2014 will likely win the day.\n\nIn the meantime, the attempts to commandeer and amplify versions of that story will continue to Election Day and beyond. As long as there is an American nation, there will be millions of people trying to tell us what it means \u2014 desperately, angrily, optimistically, compellingly. Stories are a powerful weapon, and a potent metaphor as well. As Walz said about leaving Trump and Vance behind: \u201cI\u2019m ready to turn the page.\u201d\n\n___\n\nTed Anthony, director of new storytelling and newsroom innovation at The Associated Press, has been writing about American culture and politics for 35 years.

        "text": "More than 200 Bush, McCain, Romney alums endorse Harris for president, criticize Trump\nWASHINGTON \u2014 More than 200 Republicans who previously worked for either former President George W. Bush, the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., or Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for president in an open letter Monday obtained exclusively by USA TODAY.\n\nThe letter from alums of the three Republican presidential nominees prior to former President Donald Trump comes on the heels of a Democratic National Convention last week in Chicago that showcased Republican detractors of the GOP nominee. At least five former aides to former President George H.W. Bush also signed the letter, which has 238 signatures in all.\n\nA similar group of about 150 anti-Trump former staffers of Bush, McCain and Romney pledged support for President Joe Biden in the 2020 election.\n\n\"We reunite today, joined by new George H.W. Bush alumni, to reinforce our 2020 statements and, for the first time, jointly declare that we\u2019re voting for Vice President Kamala Harris and Gov. Tim Walz this November,\" the letter reads. \"Of course, we have plenty of honest, ideological disagreements with Vice President Harris and Gov. Walz. That\u2019s to be expected. The alternative, however, is simply untenable.\"\n\n(Read the letter here.)\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nAmong those who signed the letter in support of Harris and her running-mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, include: former McCain chiefs of staff Mark Salter and Chris Koch; Joe Donoghue, former legislative director for McCain; Jennifer Lux, press secretary for McCain's 2008 campaign, and Jean Becker, longtime chief of staff for George H.W. Bush.\n\nAlso backing Harris are David Nierenberg, Romney's 2012 campaign finance chair; David Garman, under secretary of Energy for George W.

Bush, whose family has long been at odds with Trump, did not attend last month's Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, though has refrained form criticizing Trump publicly.

        "text": "The 2024 U.S. Presidential Race: A Cheat Sheet\nNo one alive has seen a race like this.\n\nSign up for The Decision, a newsletter featuring our 2024 election coverage.\n\nThe 2024 presidential election was already like none in living memory: a matchup between the sitting president and a former president.\n\nThen it got even more historically unusual. After months of the country expecting, and dreading, a rematch of the 2020 election between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, Biden dropped out of the race on July 21, just weeks before his formal nomination and barely three months before the general election. Not since 1968 has an eligible incumbent dropped out of the race and been replaced on the ticket.\n\nIn his stead, Vice President Kamala Harris announced her candidacy (with his endorsement) and rapidly consolidated Democratic Party support. Her entry has quickly reset the race and put her in the lead\u2014though, in a sign of how calcified American politics are, it has not drastically shifted the fundamentals.\n\nThe setting of a Trump-Harris contest (presumably) caps a wild election season. Concerns about Biden\u2019s age circulated for years, but he still didn\u2019t draw a major challenger from within the party, and easily won the primary. On the Republican side, Trump ran as a de facto incumbent. Nonetheless, more than a dozen candidates announced campaigns against Trump, even though the former president\u2019s lead appeared prohibitive. He became the presumptive nominee when Nikki Haley dropped out on March 6.\n\nDavid A. Graham: The DNC had good energy. Now what?\n\nThe Democratic-candidate switch has also taken the wind out of third-party candidates, especially Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In an exceedingly odd close to an already odd campaign, Kennedy has now dropped out, forging an alliance with Trump in the hopes of helping him and hurting Democrats. The leftist Cornel West is also ostensibly running. But No Labels, which had the potential to draw the largest support, said on April 4 that it would not field a candidate.\n\nThis guide to the candidates\u2014who\u2019s in, who\u2019s out, and who\u2019s somewhere in between\u2014is a guide to who ran and who didn\u2019t. It\u2019s unlikely to be updated again, but who knows?\n\nDEMOCRATS\n\n(Chip Somodevilla / Getty)\n\nKamala Harris\n\n\n\nWho is she?\n\nHarris is the vice president of the United States.\n\nIs she running?\n\nYes. When Biden dropped out of the race, he threw his support to Harris, and she quickly launched a campaign.\n\nWhy does she want to run?\n\nHarris is the heir apparent to the Biden administration, for better or worse. She has framed her nascent campaign around \u201cfreedom\u201d and stopping Trump, a key goal for Democrats.\n\nWho wants her to run?\n\nAlthough Harris has previously had critics within the party, Democrats quickly coalesced around her. A late-July poll found that 79 percent of Democratic voters are satisfied with her candidacy.\n\nCan she win the nomination?\n\nShe has.\n\n(Joshua Roberts / Getty)\n\nJoe Biden\n\n\n\nWho is he?\n\nAfter decades of trying, Biden is the president of the United States.\n\nIs he running?\n\nYes. Biden formally announced his run on April 25, 2023. Welp, never mind about that! Biden dropped out of the race on July 21, confronted with cratering support and confidence among Democrats.\n\nWhy did he want to run?\n\nBiden had framed his campaign around two ideas: First, that he wanted to \u201cfinish the job\u201d of his term, and second, that he wanted to defend American democracy from the threat of Donald Trump. Biden believed that his record as president justified a second term.\n\nRead: The case for a primary challenge to Joe Biden\n\nWho wanted him to run?\n\nThat was the problem. Even among Democrats who found Biden to have been a great president, support collapsed after his disastrous debate performance on June 27.\n\nCould he have won the nomination?\n\nIn fact, Biden had won it during primaries\u2014one of the justifications he used for staying in the race up to the moment he left.\n\nWhat else do we know?\n\nNot since 1844 has a sitting president dropped out of the race so late.\n\n(Joshua Roberts / Getty)\n\nCenk Uygur\n\n\n\nWho is he?\n\nA pundit from the party\u2019s left flank, Uygur is probably best know for his The Young Turks network. He was briefly an MSNBC personality and also ran for Congress in California in 2020.\n\nIs he running?\n\nNo. He dropped out of the race on March 6, insofar as he was ever in it.\n\nWhy did he want to run?\n\nUygur believed that Biden would lose the 2024 election and thus wanted to force him to withdraw. \u201cI\u2019m going to do whatever I can to help him decide that this is not the right path,\u201d he told Semafor\u2019s Dave Weigel in October 2023. \u201cIf he retires now, he\u2019s a hero: He beat Trump, he did a good job of being a steward of the economy. If he doesn\u2019t, he loses to Trump, and he\u2019s the villain of the story.\u201d\n\nRead: The case for a primary challenge to Joe Biden\n\nWho wanted him to run?\n\nBasically no one. Uygur has a sizable audience\u2014his YouTube channel has millions of subscribers\u2014but that didn\u2019t mean he has any real presidential constituency.\n\nCould he have won the nomination?\n\nNo, and he had a deeper problem: He is ineligible to serve, because he was born in Turkey. This isn\u2019t an interesting nuance of the law, as with misguided questions about Ted Cruz\u2019s or John McCain\u2019s eligibility, or disinformation, as with Barack Obama\u2019s. Uygur is just not a natural-born citizen. He claimed he\u2019d take the matter to the Supreme Court and win in a \u201cslam dunk.\u201d Reader, he did not.\n\n(Bill Clark / Getty)\n\nDean Phillips\n\n\n\nWho is he?\n\nPhillips, a mildly unorthodox and interesting figure, is a Minnesota moderate serving his third term in the House.\n\nIs he running?\n\nNo. Phillips dropped out of the race after Super Tuesday. He launched his campaign in October 27 after a Hamlet act to make Mario Cuomo proud\u2014in July, he said he was considering it; in August, he said he was unlikely to run but would encourage other Democrats to do so; then, after finding no other Democrats willing to run, he said he was not ruling it out.\n\nWhy did he want to run?\n\nIn an in-depth profile by my colleague Tim Alberta, Phillips said he was most concerned about beating Trump. \u201cLook, just because [Biden\u2019s] old, that\u2019s not a disqualifier,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cBut being old, in decline, and having numbers that are clearly moving in the wrong direction? It\u2019s getting to red-alert kind of stuff.\u201d He added: \u201cSomeone had to do this. It just was so self-evident.\u201d\n\nWho wanted him to run?\n\nPhillips told Alberta that even some Biden allies privately encouraged him to run\u2014but no one would say it openly. Phillips proved prophetic, but that didn\u2019t mean ordinary Democrats were interested in him. Over the course of his campaign, Phillips drew support from to wealthy Silicon Valley figures and anti-DEI billionaire Bill Ackman.\n\nCould he have won the nomination?\n\nNo.\n\nWhat else do we know?\n\nHis grandmother was \u201cDear Abby,\u201d and he made a fortune running the Talenti gelato company.\n\n(Matthew Cavanaugh / Getty)\n\nPete Buttigieg\n\n\n\nWho is he?\n\nMayor Pete is Secretary Pete now, overseeing the Department of Transportation.\n\nIs he running?\n\nNo.\n\nWhy would he want to run?\n\nJust as he was four years ago, Buttigieg is a young, ambitious politician with a moderate, technocratic vision of government.\n\nWho wants him to run?\n\nButtigieg\u2019s fans are passionate, and Biden showed that moderates remain a force in the party.\n\nCould he have won the nomination?\n\nNot at this moment.\n\n(Scott Olson / Getty)\n\nBernie Sanders\n\n\n\nWho is he?\n\nThe senator from Vermont is changeless, ageless, ever the same.\n\nIs he running?\n\nNo.\n\nWhy would he want to run?\n\nSanders still wants to tax billionaires, level the economic playing field, and push a left-wing platform.\n\nWho wanted him to run?\n\nSanders continues to have the strong support of a large portion of the Democratic electorate, especially younger voters.\n\nCould he have won the nomination?\n\nTwo consecutive tries have shown that he\u2019s formidable, but can\u2019t close. Maybe the third time\u2019s the charm?\n\n(Chip Somodevilla / Getty)\n\nGretchen Whitmer\n\n\n\nWho is she?\n\nWhitmer cruised to a second term as governor of Michigan in 2022.\n\nIs she running?\n\nNo.\n\nWhy would she want to run?\n\nIt\u2019s a little early to know, but her reelection campaign focused on abortion rights.\n\nWho wanted her to run?\n\nWhitmer would check a lot of boxes for Democrats. She\u2019s a fresh face, she\u2019s a woman, and she\u2019s proved she can win in the upper Midwest against a MAGA candidate.\n\nCould she have won the nomination?\n\nNot if she wasn\u2019t running.\n\n(Lucas Jackson / Reuters)\n\nMarianne Williamson\n\n\n\nWho is she?\n\nIf you don\u2019t know Williamson from her popular writing on spirituality, then you surely remember her somewhat woo-woo Democratic bid in 2020.\n\nIs she running?\n\nWho even knows anymore? Williamson dropped out of the race on February 7, following a distant second-place finish in the South Carolina primary. But then on February 28, she announced she was \u201cunsuspending\u201d her campaign.\n\nWhy does she want to run (again)?\n\n\u201cI had suspended it because I was losing the horse race, but something so much more important than the horse race is at stake here. And we must respond,\u201d she said in her relaunch video. \u201cWe\u2019re watching a car crash in slow motion here.\u201d\n\nWho wants her to run?\n\nWilliamson has her fans, but she doesn\u2019t have a clear political constituency.\n\nCan she win the nomination?\n\nNah. Williamson has never really been a contender, and her impact has been muffled by messy staff issues.\n\n(Brian Cassella / Chicago Tribune / Getty)\n\nJ. B. Pritzker\n\n\n\nWho is he?\n\nThe governor of Illinois is both a scion of a wealthy family and a \u201cnomadic warrior.\u201d\n\nIs he running?\n\nNo.\n\nWhy would he want to run?\n\nAfter years of unfulfilled interest in elected office, Pritzker has established himself as a muscular proponent of progressivism in a Democratic stronghold.\n\nWho wanted him to run?\n\nImprobably for a billionaire, Pritzker has become a darling of the Sanders-style left, as well as a memelord.\n\nCould he have won the nomination?\n\nNot now.\n\nREPUBLICANS\n\n(Joe Raedle / Getty)\n\nDonald Trump\n\nWho is he?\n\nYou know him and you love him. Or hate him. Probably not much in between.\n\nIs he running?\n\nYes. Trump announced his bid to return to the White House at Mar-a-Lago in November 2022.\n\nWhy does he want to run?\n\nRevenge, boredom, rivalry, fear of prosecution, long-standing psychological hang-ups.\n\nRead: Trump begins the \u2018retribution\u2019 tour\n\nWho wants him to run?\n\nA big tranche of the GOP was always fully behind Trump, and as his rivals have failed to gain much traction, he\u2019s consolidated many of the rest and built an all-but-prohibitive lead.\n\nCan he win the nomination?\n\nHe has.\n\nWhat else do we know?\n\nMore than we could possibly want to.\n\n(Joe Raedle / Getty)\n\nRon DeSantis\n\nWho is he?\n\nThe second-term governor of Florida, DeSantis was previously a U.S. representative.\n\nIs he running?\n\nNo. He dropped out on January 21, two days before the New Hampshire primary.\n\nWhy did he want to run?\n\nDeSantis tried to synthesize Trump-style culture warring and the conservative politics of the early-2010s Republican Party, suggesting he\u2019d be like Trump, only more so and more effectively.\n\nWho wanted him to run?\n\nIn the end, not many people. Though he was once thought to be the favorite, he never figured out how to peel off Trump voters who liked the original fine, and donors tired of his expensive, directionless campaign.\n\nFrom the March 2023 issue: How did America\u2019s weirdest, most freedom-obsessed state fall for an authoritarian governor?\n\nCould he have won the nomination?\n\nMaybe a more competent campaign would have fared better\u2014it\u2019s already been labeled the worst ever by some journalists and operatives\u2014but DeSantis also revealed himself to be a clumsy and unappealing candidate, which is hard to overcome.\n\n(Roy Rochlin / Getty)\n\nNikki Haley\n\nWho is she?\n\nHaley, the daughter of immigrants, was the governor of South Carolina and then the ambassador to the United Nations under Trump.\n\nIs she running?\n\nNo. Haley dropped out on March 6, the day after she won only one Super Tuesday contest.\n\nWhy did she want to run?\n\nHaley said it was \u201ctime for a new generation.\u201d After initially declining to openly attack Trump, she later criticized him for \u201ctantrums\u201d and creating \u201cchaos.\u201d She was also the top foreign-policy hawk in the field.\n\nSarah Isgur: What Nikki Haley can learn from Carly Fiorina\n\nWho wanted her to run?\n\nAfter DeSantis collapsed, Haley became the most popular alternative to Trump, but she never had the support to supplant him.\n\nCould she have won the nomination?\n\nShe proved more viable than anyone but Trump\u2014but still, no.\n\n(Dylan Hollingsworth / Bloomberg / Getty)\n\nVivek Ramaswamy\n\nWho is he?\n\nA 38-year-old biotech millionaire with a sparkling r\u00e9sum\u00e9 (Harvard, then Yale Law, where he became friends with Senator J. D. Vance), Ramaswamy has recently become prominent as a crusader against \u201cwokeism\u201d and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing.\n\nIs he running?\n\nNo. He dropped out after a distant finish in the Iowa caucuses.\n\nWhy did he want to run?\n\nRamaswamy ran as an anti-woke candidate, but as the campaign developed, he seemed to be somewhere between a stalking horse for Trump and a man auditioning for roles in a second Trump administration.\n\nWho wanted him to run?\n\nThe paradigmatic Ramaswamy voter seemed to love Trump\u2019s vibe but be ready for a new version. He had a summer surge when he was fresh, but it subsided as people have gotten to know and\u2014like his Republican rivals\u2014dislike him.\n\nCould he have won the nomination?\n\nNo. Ramaswamy broke out of the ranks of oddballs to briefly become a mildly formidable contender, but the more voters saw him, the less they liked his slick shtick and questionable pronouncements.\n\n(Alex Wong / Getty)\n\nAsa Hutchinson\n\nWho is he?\n\nHutchinson, a former longtime member of Congress, just finished a stint as governor of Arkansas.\n\nIs he running?\n\nNo. He stuck around even after missing debates, but he finally dropped out on January 16.\n\nWhy does he want to run?\n\nHutchinson\u2014once considered a right-wing Republican\u2014found himself closer to the party\u2019s center in the Trump era. Like Chris Christie, he made opposition to Trump central to his campaign, but with a milder tone. That didn\u2019t work any better than Christie\u2019s bombastic anti-Trumpism.\n\nWho wanted him to run?\n\nOld-school, very conservative Republicans who also detest Trump.\n\nCould he have won the nomination?\n\nNo.\n\n(David Becker / The Washington Post / Getty)\n\nTim Scott\n\nWho is he?\n\nA South Carolinian, Scott is the only Black Republican senator.\n\nIs he running?\n\nNo. He said on November 12 that he was suspending his campaign.\n\nWhy did he want to run?\n\nThis was never entirely clear. Scott offered a somewhat sunny personal story but also some hard-line ideas.\n\nWho wants him to run?\n\nScott\u2019s Senate colleagues adore him, and voters\u2019 views of him were favorable, but he never translated that into real support.\n\nCan he win the nomination?\n\nNo. He could never find a way out of the second tier of candidates.\n\n(Megan Varner / Getty)\n\nMike Pence\n\nWho is he?\n\nThe former vice president, he also served as the governor of Indiana and a U.S. representative.\n\nIs he running?\n\nNo! He shocked a Las Vegas audience by dropping out on October 28. He\u2019d been running since June 7.\n\nWhy did he want to run?\n\nPence has long harbored White House dreams, and he has a strong conservative-Christian political agenda. As the campaign went on, he slowly began to develop a sharper critique of Trump while still awkwardly celebrating the accomplishments of the administration in which he served.\n\nWho wanted him to run?\n\nConservative Christians and rabbit lovers, but not very many people overall.\n\nRead: Nobody likes Mike Pence\n\nCould he have won the nomination?\n\nIt wasn\u2019t in the cards.\n\n(Ida Mae Astute / Getty)\n\nChris Christie\n\nWho is he?\n\nWhat a journey this guy has had, from U.S. attorney to respected governor of New Jersey to traffic-jam laughingstock to Trump sidekick to Trump critic. Whew.\n\nIs he running?\n\nNo. He announced on January 10 that he was dropping out, one day after calling New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu a \u201cliar\u201d for saying that his campaign was nearly over.\n\nWhy did he want to run?\n\nBy the end of his campaign, Chris Christie had turned himself into the most anti-Trump candidate in the race\u2014calling the former president out, with names and with rhetoric, and insisting he shouldn\u2019t be the GOP nominee. In fact, that came to be Christie\u2019s only real identity as a candidate.\n\nWho wanted him to run?\n\nTrump-skeptical donors, liberal pundits. But by the end, even some Trump critics were pressuring him to drop out in order to allow the non-Trump vote to consolidate.\n\nCould he have won the nomination?\n\nNo staunchly anti-Trump candidate could win in Trump\u2019s Republican Party.\n\n(Todd Williamson / Getty)\n\nDoug Burgum\n\nWho is he?\n\nDo you even pay attention to politics? Nah, just kidding. A self-made software billionaire, Burgum is serving his second term as the governor of North Dakota.\n\nIs he running?\n\nNo more. Burgum suspended his campaign on December 4. He\u2019d kicked it off on June 7 in Fargo.\n\nWhy did he want to run?\n\nVanity? Boredom? Noble but doomed impulses? Who knows. His campaign-announcement video focuses so much on North Dakota that it seemed more like a reelection push. He told a state newspaper that he thinks the \u201csilent majority\u201d of Americans wants candidates who aren\u2019t on the extremes. (A wealthy outsider targeting the silent majority? Where have we heard that before?) He also really wants more domestic oil production.\n\nWho wanted him to run?\n\nPractically no one. He had to give people $20 gift cards to get them to donate to his campaign so he could qualify for debates.\n\nCould he have won the nomination?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a value to being underestimated all the time,\u201d he has said. As it turns out, the naysayers estimated accurately.\n\n(Scott Olson / Getty)\n\nWill Hurd\n\nWho is he?\n\nA former CIA officer, Hurd served three terms in the House, representing a San Antonio\u2013area district.\n\nIs he running?\n\nNo. Hurd, who announced his campaign on June 22, dropped out on October 9 and endorsed Nikki Haley.\n\nWhy did he want to run?\n\nHurd said he had \u201ccommonsense\u201d ideas and was \u201cpissed\u201d that elected officials are dividing Americans. He\u2019s also been an outspoken Trump critic.\n\nWho wanted him to run?\n\nAs a moderate, youngish Black Republican and someone who cares about defense, he is the sort of candidate whom the party establishment seemed to desire after the now-discarded 2012 GOP autopsy.\n\nCould he have won the nomination?\n\nNo.\n\n(Mandel Ngan / Getty)\n\nFrancis Suarez\n\nWho is he?\n\nSuarez is the popular second-term mayor of Miami and the president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors.\n\nIs he running?\n\nNo. He suspended his campaign on August 29, less than three months after his June 15 entry.\n\nWhy did he want to run?\n\nSuarez touted his youth\u2014he\u2019s 45\u2014and said in October 2022, \u201cI\u2019m someone who believes in a positive aspirational message. I\u2019m someone who has a track record of success and a formula for success.\u201d\n\nWho wanted him to run?\n\nIs there really room for another moderate-ish Republican in the race? Apparently not! Despite dabbling in fundraising shenanigans, Suarez failed to make the first Republican debate (or any other splash).\n\nCould he have won the nomination?\n\nNo way.\n\n(Drew Angerer / Getty)\n\nLarry Hogan\n\nWho is he?\n\nHogan left office this year, after serving two terms as governor of Maryland.\n\nIs he running?\n\nNo. Hogan ruled himself out of the GOP race in 2023, saying he was worried that entering would help Trump win the nomination. He endorsed Nikki Haley, but was rumored as a potential No Labels candidate. On February 9, however, he filed to run for U.S. Senate in Maryland.\n\nWhy did he want to run?\n\nHogan has argued that his experience of governing a very blue state as a Republican is a model: \u201cWe\u2019ve been really successful outside of Washington, where everything appears to be broken and nothing but divisiveness and dysfunction.\u201d\n\nWho wanted him to run?\n\nDead-ender centrists.\n\nCould he win the nomination?\n\nNo.\n\n(John Locher / AP)\n\nChris Sununu\n\nWho is he?\n\nThe governor of New Hampshire, he is the little brother of former Senator John E. Sununu and the son of former White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu.\n\nIs he running?\n\nNo. On June 5, after weighing a campaign, he announced that he would not run. Warning about the dangers of a Trump reprise, he said, \u201cEvery candidate needs to understand the responsibility of getting out and getting out quickly if it\u2019s not working.\u201d Points for taking his own advice!\n\nWhy did he want to run?\n\nSununu seems disgusted by a lot of Washington politics and saw his success in New Hampshire, a purple-blue state, as a model for small-government conservatism. He is also a prominent Trump critic.\n\nWho wanted him to run?\n\nTrump-skeptical Republicans, old-school conservatives.\n\nCould he have won the nomination?\n\nNo.\n\n(Scott Olson / Getty)\n\nMike Pompeo\n\nWho is he?\n\nPompeo, a former member of Congress, led the CIA and was secretary of state under Trump.\n\nIs he running?\n\nNo. On April 14, Pompeo announced that he wasn\u2019t running. \u201cThis is not that time or that moment for me to seek elected office again,\u201d he said.\n\nWhy did he want to run?\n\nPompeo has always been ambitious, and he seems to think he can combine MAGA proximity with a hawkish foreign-policy approach.\n\nWho wanted him to run?\n\nThat\u2019s not entirely clear.\n\nCould he have won the nomination?\n\nMaybe, but probably not.\n\n(Misha Friedman / Getty)\n\nGlenn Youngkin\n\nWho is he?\n\nYoungkin, the former CEO of the private-equity Carlyle Group, was elected governor of Virginia in 2021.\n\nIs he running?\n\nNo. He spent much of 2023 refusing to categorically rule out a race but not quite committing. As Ron DeSantis\u2019s Trump-alternative glow dimmed, Youngkin seemed to be hoping that Republican success in off-year Virginia legislative elections would give him a boost. After Democrats won control of both the state\u2019s legislative chambers, however, he said he was \u201cnot going anywhere.\u201d\n\nWhy did he want to run?\n\nYoungkin is a bit of a cipher; he ran for governor largely on education issues, and has sought to tighten abortion laws in Virginia, but the legislative defeat makes that unlikely.\n\nWho wanted him to run?\n\nRupert Murdoch, reportedly, as well as other wealthy, business-friendly Republican figures.\n\nCould he have won the nomination?\n\nCertainly not without running, and almost certainly not if he did.\n\n(Sam Wolfe / Bloomberg / Getty)\n\nMike Rogers\n\nWho is he?\n\nRogers is a congressman from Alabam\u2014wait, no, sorry, that\u2019s the other Representative Mike Rogers. This one is from Michigan and retired in 2015. He was previously an FBI agent and was head of the Intelligence Committee while on Capitol Hill.\n\nIs he running?\n\nNo. He thought about it but announced in late August that he would run for U.S. Senate instead.\n\nWhy did he want to run?\n\nHe laid out some unassailably broad ideas for a campaign in an interview with Fox News, including a focus on innovation and civic education, but it\u2019s hard to tell what exactly the goal is here. \u201cThis is not a vanity project for me,\u201d he added, which, okay, sure.\n\nWho wanted him to run?\n\nIt\u2019s not clear that anyone even noticed he was running.\n\nCould he have won the nomination?\n\nNope.\n\n(Todd Williamson / Getty)\n\nLarry Elder\n\nWho is he?\n\nA longtime conservative radio host and columnist, he ran as a Republican in the unsuccessful 2021 attempt to recall California Governor Gavin Newsom.\n\nIs he running?\n\nNot anymore. Elder announced his campaign on Tucker Carlson\u2019s Fox News show on April 20, but then disappeared without a trace. On October 27, he dropped out and endorsed Trump.\n\nWhy did he want to run?\n\nGlad you asked! \u201cAmerica is in decline, but this decline is not inevitable,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cWe can enter a new American Golden Age, but we must choose a leader who can bring us there. That\u2019s why I\u2019m running for President.\u201d We don\u2019t have any idea what that means either.\n\nWho wanted him to run?\n\nPractically no one.\n\nCould he have won the nomination?\n\nAbsolutely not.\n\n(Todd Williamson / Getty)\n\nRick Perry\n\nWho is he?\n\nPerry was a three-term governor of Texas before serving as energy secretary under Donald Trump. He\u2019s also run for president three times: in 2012, 2016, and \u2026 I forget the third one. Oops.\n\nIs he running?\n\nOh, right! The third one is 2024, maybe. He told CNN in May that he\u2019s considering a run. Nothing\u2019s been heard since. We\u2019ll say no.\n\nWhy did he want to run?\n\nHe didn\u2019t say, but he\u2019s struggled to articulate much of a compelling case to Republican voters beyond the fact that he\u2019s from Texas, he looks good in a suit, and he wants to be president, gosh darn it.\n\nWho wanted him to run?\n\nProbably no one. As Mike Pompeo already discovered, there wasn\u2019t much of a market for a run-of-the-mill former Trump Cabinet member in the primary\u2014especially one who had such a forgettable turn as secretary, mostly remembered for being dragged peripherally into both the first Trump impeachment and election subversion.\n\nCould he have won the nomination?\n\nThe third time wouldn\u2019t have been a charm.\n\n(Joe Raedle / Getty)\n\nRick Scott\n\nWho is he?\n\nBefore his current gig as a U.S. senator from Florida, Scott was governor and chief executive of a health-care company that committed massive Medicare fraud.\n\nIs he running?\n\nThe New York Times says he\u2019s considering it, though an aide said Scott is running for reelection to the Senate. He\u2019d be the fourth Floridian in the race.\n\nWhy does he want to run?\n\nA Scott campaign would raise a fascinating question: What if you took Trump\u2019s pose and ideology but removed all the charisma and, instead of promising to protect popular entitlement programs, aimed to demolish them?\n\nWho wants him to run?\n\nNot Mitch McConnell.\n\nCan he win the nomination?\n\nlol\n\n\n\nTHIRD-PARTY AND INDEPENDENT\n\n(Brian Cassella / Chicago Tribune / Getty)\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\n\n\nWho is he?\n\nThe son of a presidential candidate, the nephew of another, and the nephew of a president, Kennedy is a longtime environmental activist and also a chronic crank.\n\nIs he running?\n\nSort of? On August 23, Kennedy announced that he is suspending his campaign but not ending it. In a bid to help Trump, whom he endorsed, he\u2019s exiting the ballot in closely contested states, but staying put in other states and asking that supporters still pull the lever for him. Kennedy previously announced his run for the Democratic nomination on April 19, 2023, and on October 9 of that year, he dropped out to run as an independent.\n\nWhy did he want to run?\n\nRunning for president is a family tradition. His campaign was arranged around his esoteric combination of left-wing interests (the environment, drug prices) and right-wing causes (vaccine skepticism, anger about social-media \u201cdeplatforming\u201d), but his pseudo-exit aids Trump, apparently as a way to get back at a Democratic establishment whose rejection has deeply hurt him.\n\nWho wanted him to run?\n\nWhen he announced, Kennedy reached double digits in polls against Biden, but by the time he suspended his campaign, he\u2019d lost most of his support, and by some measures was drawing votes mostly from Trump.\n\nWhat were his prospects?\n\nKennedy was never going to be president, but he has succeeded in ruining whatever was left of his respectability. Now, with nothing on the line, he's doing what he can to return Trump to power\u2014a craven end to a craven run.\n\n(Tom Williams / Getty)\n\nJoe Manchin\n\n\n\nWho is he?\n\nA Democratic U.S. senator and former governor of West Virginia, he was the pivotal centrist vote for the first two years of Joe Biden\u2019s term.\n\nIs he running?\n\nNo. Manchin announced on February 16 that he wouldn\u2019t run, after months of flirtation.\n\nWhy did he want to run?\n\nSome mix of true belief and umbrage. I\u2019ve described him as \u201ca middle-of-the-road guy with good electoral instincts, decent intentions, and bad ideas,\u201d but he also periodically seems personally piqued at Biden and the Democrats over slights perceived or real.\n\nWho wanted him to run?\n\nThe centrist group No Labels courted him as a candidate, seeking a high-profile figure willing to buck his party. Democrats were terrified that he\u2019d siphon off enough votes to hand Trump or another Republican the win in a three-way race.\n\nWhat were his prospects?\n\n\u201cMake no mistake, I will win any race I enter,\u201d he said in April. That might explain his decision to skip it.\n\n(Frederick M. Brown / Getty)\n\nCornel West\n\n\n\nWho is he?\n\nWest is a philosopher, a theologian, a professor, a preacher, a gadfly, a progressive activist, an actor, a spoken-word recording artist, an author \u2026 and we\u2019re probably missing a few.\n\nIs he running?\n\nYes. He announced his campaign on the People\u2019s Party ticket on June 5. Soon thereafter he switched to the Green Party, which might have gotten him the best ballot access. But as of October, he\u2019s running as an independent.\n\nWhy does he want to run?\n\n\u201cIn these bleak times, I have decided to run for truth and justice, which takes the form of running for president of the United States,\u201d he said in his announcement video. West is a fierce leftist who has described Trump as a \u201cneofascist\u201d and Biden as a \u201cmilquetoast neoliberal.\u201d\n\nWho wants him to run?\n\nWest was a high-profile backer of Bernie Sanders, and it\u2019s easy to imagine him winning over some of Sanders\u2019s fervent fans. Now that he is running as an independent, he will likely have trouble building a base of his own.\n\nWhat are his prospects?\n\nLet\u2019s hear from Brother West: \u201cDo we have what it takes? We shall see,\u201d he said. \u201cBut some of us are going to go down fighting, go down swinging, with style and a smile.\u201d\n\n(Alex Wong / Getty)\n\nJill Stein\n\n\n\nWho is she?\n\nHere\u2019s what I wrote in 2016: \u201cA Massachusetts resident and physician, she is a candidate of nearly Stassen-like frequency, having run for president in 2012 and a slew of other offices before that.\u201d\n\nIs she running?\n\nSo it seems. Now that Cornel West\u2019s campaign (which she briefly managed, whatever that means) has dropped out of contention for the Green Party nomination, she has filed to run on the Green line.\n\nWhy does she want to run?\n\nThough she hasn\u2019t laid out a platform yet, you can get a decent sense of what her campaign is likely to look like from her 2016 issues: a pretty standard leftist focus on social justice, the environment, and peace. Her weird comments after the 2016 election make one suspect that vanity plays a role, too.\n\nWho wants her to run?\n\nThe Green Party has a small but consistent batch of voters and ballot access in many states. It\u2019s also clear who doesn\u2019t want her to run: Democrats who fear that an even halfway effective Green candidate will cost Harris just enough votes to lose in key swing states. (For the record, the case that she cost Hillary Clinton the 2016 race is shaky.)\n\nWhat are her prospects?\n\nSince she\u2019s the closest thing the Greens have to a proven quantity, she should be in a strong position for the nomination. And then what?\n\n(Gary Gershoff / Getty)\n\nLiz Cheney\n\n\n\nWho is she?\n\nThe scion of a rock-ribbed Republican family in Wyoming, she served in House GOP leadership before breaking with Trump and losing her 2022 primary.\n\nIs she running?\n\nNo. She told The Washington Post in December that she was considering a run, but gave no indications of a campaign after that.\n\nWhy would she want to run?\n\nShe says she will do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to deprive Trump of a second term. It also can\u2019t hurt to tease a campaign when you\u2019re launching a new book, as she is.\n\nWho wanted her to run?\n\nAs a lifelong conservative, Cheney would have drawn the support of many Never Trump Republicans. Because she has become an unlikely resistance hero, she might also have attracted independents and even Democrats who detest Trump but weren\u2019t hot on Biden.\n\nWhat were her prospects?\n\nCheney wouldn\u2019t have won, but that presumably wouldn\u2019t have been her goal. Whether she\u2019d have done much to hurt Trump is another question.",

        "text": "FAU/Mainstreet USA Poll: Harris Gains Momentum in Wake of DNC\nFAU/Mainstreet USA Poll: Harris Gains Momentum in Wake of DNC\n\nThe 2024 presidential election is just a few months away\n\nA new poll from the Florida Atlantic University Political Communication and Public Opinion Research Lab ( PolCom Lab ) and Mainstreet Research USA reveals significant shifts in the 2024 U.S. presidential race, underscoring deep gender and racial divides among voters across the nation. Watch the video analysis of this report at faupolling.com.\n\nU.S. Vice President Kamala Harris has taken the lead over former U.S. President Donald Trump nationally, with 47% of voters supporting her compared to Trump\u2019s 43%. Among likely voters, Harris leads 49% to 45%. She has gained strong support among women, with 53% backing her, while 45% of men favor her. Trump\u2019s base remains predominantly male, with 47% support from men, compared to 41% from women.\n\n\n\nHarris also holds substantial advantages among Black voters (73%), Hispanic voters (51%), and white college-educated voters (57%). Trump, however, continues to command strong support among white voters without a college degree, with 59% favoring him.\n\n\u201cSince her elevation to the top of the ticket, Vice President Harris has effectively appealed to women voters, and the gender gap has become more pronounced,\u201d said Luzmarina Garcia, Ph.D., assistant professor of political science at FAU. \u201cHarris has also reestablished the Democratic Party\u2019s advantage with minority voters.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s Support Erodes Among Independents\n\nHarris has also made significant inroads among Independent voters, now capturing 48% of their support, compared to Trump\u2019s 35%. This marks a notable shift from July when Independents were more evenly split, with 45% backing Harris and 43% supporting Trump.\n\n\u201cTrump is losing support from Independents compared to July, which could be a result of the Democratic Party convention and remains to be watched,\u201d said Dukhong Kim, Ph.D., associate professor of political science at FAU. \u201cIf this pattern persists, it will be difficult for Trump to maintain an advantage in the election.\u201d\n\nCongressional Voting Preferences\n\nThe poll shows that 46% of respondents would vote for the Democratic Party candidate in their district, compared to 44% for the Republican Party candidate.\n\n\u201cThe generic ballot illustrates just how closely divided the nation continues to be,\u201d said Kevin Wagner, Ph.D., professor of political science and co-director of the PolCom Lab. \u201cIt suggests that the current default is for close and tightly contested elections.\u201d\n\nElection Anxiety: Mixed Emotions Ahead of 2024\n\nThe poll reveals a stark emotional divide as the election approaches, with negative emotions slightly outweighing positive ones by 44% to 41%. This emotional split becomes more pronounced when viewed through the lens of voting intentions:\n\nHarris supporters: 52% positive, 35% negative\n\nTrump supporters: 34% positive, 49% negative\n\nUndecided voters: 23% positive, 50% negative\n\nNotably, 27% of Democrats reported feeling excited about the election, while 32% of Republicans expressed fear.\n\n\u201cWhile Democrats seem energized by the Harris-Walz ticket, there\u2019s a significant undercurrent of anxiety across the electorate,\u201d said Carol Bishop Mills, Ph.D., professor of communication and co-director of the PolCom Lab. \u201cThese findings highlight the intense political polarization and uncertainty surrounding this election.\u201d\n\nPerception of Candidates\n\nOn the political spectrum, Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, representing the Democratic ticket, are generally perceived as left-leaning. Harris is viewed as more strongly on the far left (37%), compared to Walz (28%). However, Walz is seen as more moderate, with 18% of voters placing him in the center, compared to fewer voters unsure of Harris\u2019 position. On the Republican side, Trump and Vance are viewed as right-leaning, with Trump categorized as far right by 37% of voters and Vance by 30%. Trump\u2019s position is highly polarized, with voters seeing him as either far right or far left, while Vance has a higher percentage of voters uncertain about his placement. These perceptions highlight the ideological divide between the two tickets.\n\n\u201cAlthough both Trump and Harris are similarly seen as conservative and liberal, respectively, Tim Walz is viewed by voters as a more moderate candidate,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cThat may change, but it does give the Democrats an opportunity to appeal to the center.\u201d\n\nParty Lines Define Satisfaction with U.S. Democracy\n\nThe survey found that 46% of Americans are satisfied with how democracy works in the U.S., while 38% are dissatisfied. However, the gap widens along party lines: 64% of Democrats express satisfaction compared to just 33% of Republicans.\n\nDespite these differences, most Americans still believe in democratic principles. A strong 74% agree that democracy is the best system of government. This view is more common among older voters (81% of those 50 and up) and Democrats (85%) than younger voters (65% of those under 50) and Republicans (65%).\n\n\u201cThe partisan and age splits on America\u2019s democratic quality are concerning,\u201d Kim said. \u201cA substantial portion of voters (38%) are either very dissatisfied or somewhat dissatisfied, which could have negative implications for the future of our democracy.\u201d\n\nSocial Media Influence Grows Among Young Voters\n\nA significant portion of respondents rely on cable news (35%) and national network TV (24%) for political information. However, a notable shift in voter consumption patterns is emerging, with social media and podcasts becoming increasingly popular, especially among younger voters (20% for ages 18-49 vs. 7% for those 50+).\n\n\u201cThis trend underscores the growing impact of social media influencers on public opinion,\u201d said Robert E. Gutsche, Jr., Ph.D., associate professor in FAU\u2019s School of Communication and Multimedia Studies. \u201cWith younger voters relying more on social media, the campaigns will have to reach them there.\u201d\n\nMethodology\n\nThe poll surveyed 929 registered U.S. voters from Aug. 23 to 25, using a combination of Interactive Voice Response and online panel methods. Conducted in both English and Spanish, the survey applied weights for gender, race, education and past vote. Party identification was self-reported. A likely voter screen was applied based on respondents\u2019 stated voting intentions.

While it has been reviewed by human transcribers, it may contain errors. Please review the episode audio before quoting from this transcript and email transcripts@nytimes.com with any questions.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nFrom \u201cThe New York Times,\u201d I\u2019m Michael Barbaro. This is \u201cThe Daily.\u201d [MUSIC PLAYING] Today, US authorities have repeatedly warned that foreign governments would seek to meddle in this year\u2019s presidential race. It now appears that they were right. My colleague, White House and national security correspondent David Sanger brings us the story of the first major cyber attack of the 2024 campaign. [MUSIC PLAYING] It\u2019s Tuesday, August 27. David, a few weeks ago, just after the Republican National Convention, when the presidential race is entering its most intensive phase, the Trump campaign comes out, and it says, we have been hacked. And it doesn\u2019t get a ton of attention at the time. But you have been trying to understand what actually happened. So tell us what you have learned.\n\ndavid sanger\n\nIt started the Friday before President Trump and his campaign made that announcement.\n\narchived recording 1 A major warning from Microsoft about foreign interference in the upcoming US presidential election.\n\ndavid sanger\n\nThere was a report that came out from Microsoft. And Microsoft, of course, has an incredible view across the internet because people are using so many different Microsoft products. So they\u2019re usually among the first to see hacker activity.\n\narchived recording 2 Microsoft outlining what it says was an Iranian cyberattack on an active presidential campaign.\n\ndavid sanger\n\nAnd so before Trump made his statement, they released a report that declared that there was a hacking group run by Iran.\n\narchived recording 3 Iran sent fake emails from a compromised email account of a former senior advisor.\n\ndavid sanger\n\nAnd that it had successfully breached the account of what they called a former senior advisor to a presidential campaign.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nVery tantalizing, but also very mysterious.\n\ndavid sanger\n\nExactly, Michael.\n\narchived recording 4 Over the weekend, former President Donald Trump said his campaign was hacked, and he blamed Iran.\n\ndavid sanger\n\nAnd then the next day, President Trump came out in his campaign and said that they had been informed by Microsoft several weeks before that they had, in fact, been hacked.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) Unsurprisingly, Iran is now trying to tilt the election in Kamala\u2019s favor very strongly. They\u2019re trying to \u2014 they\u2019re openly fighting for it.\n\ndavid sanger\n\nBut Mr. Trump, in his usual way, kind of fogged it up by saying, don\u2019t worry, they didn\u2019t get anything you couldn\u2019t get from our website. It wasn\u2019t terribly important. But he wanted to make the point that a foreign intelligence operation was trying to interfere in his campaign.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nGot it, and between these twin announcements, the first from Microsoft, the second from the Trump campaign, what do you end up learning has actually occurred here?\n\ndavid sanger\n\nWell, this was a strange enough set of events that a group of us all began to dig in. I talked to Microsoft investigators, and they described in a little more detail what they had learned.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm.\n\ndavid sanger\n\nThen we also talked to federal investigators because we had every reason to believe that the FBI was on to this as well. And from our sources, we learned Iran also targeted the Biden-Harris campaign. The bigger surprise, Michael, would have been if they hadn\u2019t, but we don\u2019t know if it had any real effects.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHmm.\n\ndavid sanger\n\nAnd then my colleagues, Maggie Haberman and Adam Goldman and Glenn Thrush, began to dig around with the campaigns. And they spoke to Roger Stone, who you\u2019ll remember was a longtime and very close advisor to former President Trump. He was deeply involved in the effort to alter the results of the 2020 election. But it turns out that he had received a warning also from Microsoft and from federal investigators that both his Hotmail and Gmail accounts had been compromised. So piecing that all together, it appears that here\u2019s what happened. The Iranians ran what\u2019s called a spear phishing campaign on Roger Stone, got him to answer an email and basically give them access to his email accounts. And then they leveraged that to send out emails that appeared to come from Stone, right, a trusted old friend of the Trump campaign, to senior members of the current campaign. And so it was a pretty sophisticated, socially engineered hack by the Iranians to gain access to the Trump campaign by pretending to be Roger Stone.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDavid, I want to get to whether or not this phishing expedition got Iran anything that it was looking for. But let\u2019s start with Iran\u2019s motivation for trying to get inside the Trump campaign in the first place. Why try to hack this campaign?\n\ndavid sanger\n\nWell, the key to this, Michael, was the fact that Microsoft left no doubt about who they thought this was. It wasn\u2019t some mysterious organization out there someplace. It was the military, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the IRGC, which is the most elite part of the Iranian military, and historically, some of their most successful and aggressive group of hackers. They\u2019ve got a lot of motivations to try to derail a Trump presidency. It\u2019s not simply that Trump is anti-Iran. He\u2019s the one who killed off the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions on the country, just when they thought they had reached an agreement with the United States that basically traded progress in their nuclear program for reentering the world economy. Not only that, he was singularly responsible for the death of Qasem Soleimani, who was a revered general, rose through the IRGC ranks, ultimately ran the Quds Force, which is one of their most powerful units. And he was killed in January of 2020.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight, and Trump personally, as I remember it, authorized his assassination.\n\ndavid sanger\n\nThat\u2019s exactly right.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI want to ask you, when it comes to this hack, do we know what Iran actually obtained from this attempted hacking effort?\n\ndavid sanger\n\nWell, it\u2019s a complicated question, Michael, because we don\u2019t know whether the senior members of Trump\u2019s campaign fell for the same phishing attempt that Roger Stone fell for. And we don\u2019t know whether or not the Iranians, as a result, were able to get inside the campaign\u2019s systems and networks. What we do know is that around the same time that the Trump campaign announced this hack, a number of news organizations, including \u201cThe Times,\u201d reported that they had received some documents, largely vetting documents, that would be used to go assess potential candidates for vice president. There were about, oh, 200 pages or so. And they appeared to be internal, from the Trump campaign. So people jumped to the conclusion that it must have come from the Iranian hack.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI mean, that would be a very logical conclusion. And I think for most of us who\u2019ve covered politics over the past decade, that was the moment where we said to ourselves, uh-oh, this is 2016 all over again. A foreign government with a stake in the election, stealing emails from a campaign to try to embarrass the candidate and prevent that candidate from becoming president. In 2016, it was when Russia stole emails from Hillary Clinton, gave them to reporters. And now this time around, it appeared Iran was doing the same thing, trying to steal emails from the Trump campaign to embarrass him by giving those emails to reporters.\n\ndavid sanger\n\nWell, Michael, that\u2019s exactly what everyone thought was happening initially. But I\u2019ve covered cyber issues long enough to know that it\u2019s really easy to leap to a conclusion that a certain set of documents came from a certain hack. And I\u2019ve been wrong plenty of times before. And the more we looked at these, we just weren\u2019t sure because the nature of the documents, which were not immensely revealing, could have come from the Iranian hack. But you\u2019d expect that they\u2019d have a lot more if they had free range inside the Trump campaign. Instead, they could just as easily have come from a disgruntled insider. They weren\u2019t particularly confidential. Most of these 200 pages were filled up with statements that were excerpts of lines that Vance had used about how much he disliked or distrusted Trump in the past. Frankly, there was nothing there that couldn\u2019t have been assembled by a bright college intern who spent a day making their way through Google to just try to put together a dossier of nasty public things Vance had already said.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nUnderstood. You\u2019re saying that the 2016 analogy isn\u2019t really a good one. But I think we should explain that for just a moment, because I think a lot of people who learned about this Iranian hack wondered, why aren\u2019t we seeing news outlets publishing stories based on what they presumed Iran had stolen and that our journalists had in their possession that might embarrass Trump? And why weren\u2019t they publishing these emails in the same way that they had when Russia stole embarrassing emails about Hillary Clinton? And I hear you saying that we aren\u2019t sitting on embarrassing emails from the Trump campaign. If anything, we\u2019re sitting on publicly available information that, as you said, a bright young intern could find from Google searches about JD Vance and that we don\u2019t even know where these emails came from, who took them, which is why \u201cThe New York Times,\u201d among other news agencies, hasn\u2019t really published any of this so far.\n\ndavid sanger\n\nYeah, that\u2019s exactly right. And I mean, it\u2019s not my call. That\u2019s for senior editors of the paper. And there was certainly a live discussion of the question, but it was very different from what we saw in 2016, which were clearly emails from inside a campaign. Some of them came from John Podesta\u2019s account, a senior campaign official. Those emails gave you a sense of the internal dissonance within Clinton\u2019s campaign. There was an email, for instance, in which Podesta and his aides criticized Clinton for what they thought were her terrible instincts as a candidate. We learned about the contents of paid speeches that Clinton had given that became the subject of controversy in the campaign because she had declined to publicly release them.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\ndavid sanger\n\nAnd while the publication of these emails has always upset some of Hillary Clinton\u2019s supporters, the journalistic explanation was that they revealed things we previously didn\u2019t know. Now, the documents we got this month, ostensibly from inside the Trump campaign, they fundamentally didn\u2019t have any news in them. Now, Michael, it\u2019s also possible we\u2019re just at the beginning of this and that at some point, we\u2019ll see more documents. And maybe they\u2019ll be revealing of what\u2019s happening inside the Trump campaign. But we\u2019d have to have a pretty active journalistic discussion at that time about whether any new documents were newsworthy. And, of course, there\u2019s always the question of whether you\u2019re doing the bidding of a foreign government by publishing them.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo that conversation aside for just a moment, it very much feels like Iran\u2019s attempted hack of the Trump campaign is our first real Warning that this election, 2024, is going to be another election in which foreign governments try to put their finger on the scale, try to influence the course of and the outcome of our presidential election.\n\ndavid sanger\n\nFour years is a lifetime in the technological advancement of hacking techniques, of the sophistication of information operations. And now, of course, we have a whole new factor, far more sophisticated artificial intelligence tools that can be used to fool voters and so forth. And of course, the number of countries that are interested in influencing the US election is growing. And they\u2019ve got capabilities of their own to interfere. And so when you add all of this together and you compress the problem into a pretty short cycle until Election Day, it could be a more potent threat to interfere in the election process than we\u2019ve seen in past years. [MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe\u2019ll be right back. David, let\u2019s talk about these threats to the 2024 election that you just raised, this growing cast of players that are a threat to our system and what they might do to influence this election.\n\ndavid sanger\n\nWell, Michael, the primary actors that the US intelligence community is concerned about is the old set of actors. It\u2019s Russia, it\u2019s China, and it\u2019s, obviously, Iran, as we\u2019ve been discussing. So, in early July, ahead of all of this news about the Trump campaign and Roger Stone and Microsoft and all that, the US intelligence community issued a public alert and said, here\u2019s what they\u2019re worried about. Obviously, their first and biggest concern was Russia. And they were saying that they we\u2019re beginning to see the Russians identify specific voter demographics and go amplify those divisive narratives that they use so well in 2016, when you\u2019ll recall they grabbed on social divisions, whether it was abortion or gun control or something like that. And they used it to go try to influence that election.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. The idea was that they were going to inflame existing partisan divisions in our country.\n\ndavid sanger\n\nThat\u2019s right, because that\u2019s far more effective than trying to create something anew. Now, for the Russians, it was pretty clear what their desired outcome was. They are very pro-Trump. The Iranians, as we\u2019ve discussed, are very anti-Trump. And then in the middle of this are the Chinese, who have been a lot more cautious. The intelligence agencies doubt they\u2019re really planning to try to influence the outcome here because they\u2019re really not sure which candidate they dislike the most. Trump obviously blamed China for COVID, has threatened huge tariffs on their goods. But it was Joe Biden who actually put export restrictions on the most high-end chips that the Chinese need to develop the large language models for artificial intelligence.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo just to summarize, Russia, when it thinks about meddling in our election, wants to do whatever it can to help Trump. Iran wants to do everything it can to hurt Trump, which we presume means they\u2019d like to see Kamala Harris win. And when it comes to China, we don\u2019t really know which side China has picked. I\u2019m curious, when the US officials you talked to think about meddling in 2024, what precise scenario they most fear from these three countries?\n\ndavid sanger\n\nWell, it\u2019s a great question, because there are different techniques, and they fear them for different reasons. So we\u2019ve already talked about one of them, which is, you phish into a campaign. You get some embarrassing memos. You release them. OK, so we\u2019re up on that. Then there\u2019s the disinformation stuff. You go, and you create bots or fake news. And then there\u2019s the third one, which some US officials are most concerned about. And frankly, it\u2019s the one that concerns me the most about trying to tamper with the election itself on Election Day to create doubts about whether this was truly a fairly run vote.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat would election tampering from a foreign government look like exactly?\n\ndavid sanger\n\nWell, we focused a lot in 2016 on the question of whether or not you could actually play with the voting numbers and the election machines. And what we learned is that that\u2019s really hard. And it\u2019s hard because our system is so disparate, right? Every state uses a different method. Some places use paper ballots. Some places use ballots where you mark something electronically, but there\u2019s a paper backup. Some use all electronic systems and so forth. And what we\u2019ve discovered is that our system is so discombobulated, unlike the Europeans, who basically have one system used throughout an entire country, that it\u2019s actually hard to hack. OK, this is one of the rare moments \u2014\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nFascinating.\n\ndavid sanger\n\n\u2014 where the differences among the states is actually a cyber safety device for us.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight, too messy to interfere with.\n\ndavid sanger\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s impossible. But what worries me the most is less the voting machines than the state voter registration rolls.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHuh. And just to explain what you\u2019re referring to, this is the, when you vote, long ream of names and signatures that contain the identities of everyone who wants to vote.\n\ndavid sanger\n\nThat\u2019s right. And usually, in most places, you have to register well ahead of Election Day, or you\u2019ll have to have been living in a state for a certain period of time. So what worries me about the registration rolls is that in the past couple of years, we have seen a huge explosion in ransomware. This is the software that is used to lock up an entire city. You\u2019ll remember it happened to Baltimore. It happened to Atlanta. It\u2019s happened to many companies. But it\u2019s not hard to imagine a ransomware attack that was aimed at locking up a state\u2019s ability to go sign up new voters.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHuh.\n\ndavid sanger\n\nRight? And that then raises the question, did something happen to the registration during that hack or around it, so that when you go to vote, Michael, they look and say, oh, well, this is very interesting because you\u2019re voting in New York. But our system shows you moved to Arizona a few months ago, right? Or we think you\u2019re double-registered someplace. And there is the possibility of creating just enough data manipulation to make people question the accuracy and quality of the voter registration rolls.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nGot it. So the nightmare scenario is that a foreign country basically hacks into \u2014 I\u2019m making this up, but a swing district somewhere in Wisconsin, takes over the voter rolls, manipulates those voter rolls in the direction they want the election to go in that state. And we wouldn\u2019t know it happened until they released the voter rolls, perhaps after a ransom is paid. And suddenly people show up to vote, and they find out, uh-oh, I can\u2019t because my name has been deleted. I\u2019ve been moved to Idaho. And suddenly, it\u2019s a real mess.\n\ndavid sanger\n\nWhat you\u2019ve described is the outside scenario where they lock things up, and they manipulate the data. But they can do a lot of damage just by locking things up because it creates the fog about whether or not they did do anything. And if you\u2019re trying to manipulate the election, you may have done as much damage by creating the fear that data was altered than by actually altering it. And there\u2019s very little question who would seize on that doubt. It would be Donald Trump, who, with almost every campaign appearance, is throwing in the line that someone is trying to go influence the election to keep him from regaining office. Sometimes he blames the Biden administration. Sometimes he blames the FBI. Sometimes he blames CISA, the group within the Department of Homeland Security that oversees cybersecurity in the United States that\u2019s providing election help to states and towns and cities.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\ndavid sanger\n\nSo Trump is seeding the clouds out here now for the rainstorm that he might want to have happen if he lost the election.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight, and as we\u2019ve explained on the show, actually within the past week, he hasn\u2019t just seeded the clouds. He has seeded local election boards with people who anticipate that there might be interference and problems and seem very ready to raise objections to certifying the results of this 2024 election.\n\ndavid sanger\n\nThat\u2019s exactly right. And in that episode that you ran last week, what you discovered was that these election workers would have some vaguely defined right to hold up the certification of the election if there were reasonable doubts about the election outcome. So the perfect storm that people who worry about this kind of thing could imagine coming is enough foreign interference to create that doubt, and then these presumably pro-Trump newly appointed election officials using that fog of uncertainty to declare that they can\u2019t certify the results and have them reported to Congress.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm. Well, given that, David, it strikes me that even if a foreign country trying to interfere in our elections were trying to help Kamala Harris \u2014 let\u2019s say Iran \u2014 that the doubts that they would raise through their hacking efforts, their cyber attacks, would probably end up benefiting Trump more because of the doubts he has seeded and the supporters he has gotten onto these local election boards.\n\ndavid sanger\n\nYou have to think that that\u2019s right. And of course, if he comes out ahead, he\u2019s not going to mention that fog at all.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm. David, it feels worth posing a devil\u2019s advocate question here at the end about our fears of election interference, because you have raised a lot of very worrisome scenarios in our conversation. But if we think back to 2016 and we think back to 2020, I wonder if our fears of interference were greater than the reality of what foreign countries were trying to do, especially when it comes to actually tampering with results. So is it possible that we have gotten a little too worried about all of this in the way we talk to America, and maybe we should take this down a notch or two?\n\ndavid sanger\n\n2016 and 2020 give you very different answers to that question. In 2016, we knew before the election happened that the Russians were trying to get into the election rolls. And it was only after the election that we really understood the scope of the information operations that were running. In 2020, we were much better prepared. And it turned out the Russians did relatively little in that election of note. And we saw for the first time some awkward Iranian interventions. So, what\u2019s that tell you about 2024? Well, the first thing it tells you is that, yes, we can overhype the threat. But as in all threats, the threat of nuclear war, the threat of biological attack, all the other parade of horribles that you and I discuss at various moments, you can overhype the concern. But that\u2019s probably the only way to get attention focused on the possibilities and think about the preventatives.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHmm. In other words, the price of vigilance against election interference may be that we end up feeding a narrative about election interference. We don\u2019t mean to, but that may just be the cost of making sure we\u2019re prepared.\n\ndavid sanger\n\nThat\u2019s absolutely right. But let\u2019s remember here what we have at stake. [MUSIC PLAYING] This is one of the most consequential elections in American history. It comes after two election cycles in which we have worried about foreign interference and one in which a large part of the population has denied that the election turned out the way it really turned out. Because in just 2 and 1/2 months, Michael, there\u2019s going to be no more important question than whether or not this election was fairly run. There\u2019s no more important single issue for retaining confidence in our democracy and in our election system. And the two are so inextricably intertwined that we have to get this right.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, David, thank you very much.\n\ndavid sanger\n\nThank you. [MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nmichael barbaro",

        "text": "Trump adds ex-Democrats Gabbard and RFK Jr to his transition team\nTrump adds ex-Democrats Gabbard and RFK Jr to transition team\n\nReuters Ms Gabbard's endorsement of Trump is the culmination of a remarkable political journey\n\nDonald Trump has appointed Robert F Kennedy Jr and Tulsi Gabbard to his transition team, days after the two former Democrats endorsed his campaign. Ms Gabbard is a former congresswoman and military veteran who ran to be the Democratic candidate for the presidency in 2020, before distancing herself from the party. Mr Kennedy initially launched a bid to win the Democratic nomination this time around, but later ran as an independent before dropping out and endorsing Trump. Meanwhile, more than 200 Republicans who served under previous presidents and party leaders have given their backing to Trump's rival, Kamala Harris.\n\nIn an open letter, former staffers for George HW Bush and George W Bush, and Senators John McCain and Mitt Romney said another Trump administration would endanger American democracy. The Republicans wrote: \"Of course, we have plenty of honest, ideological disagreements with Vice President Harris and Gov Walz. That\u2019s to be expected. \"The alternative, however, is simply untenable.\"\n\nTransition team\n\nThe Trump campaign said Ms Gabbard and Mr Kennedy would serve as honorary transition team co-chairs, along with Trump's sons and running mate JD Vance. Presidential transition teams kick into action when a candidate is elected. They help select political appointees and set priorities for the incoming administration. Trump senior advisor Brian Hughes said that the endorsements of the two former Democrats show how the campaign was earning support \"across partisan lines\". \"We look forward to having their powerful voices on the team as we work to restore America\u2019s greatness,\" he said in a statement. On Monday, Trump welcomed Ms Gabbard, 43, to a stage in Detroit, in the key swing state of Michigan. Ms Gabbard, who represented Hawaii in Congress from 2013 to 2021, quit the Democratic Party in 2022, complaining of its \"wokeness\". She appeared alongside Trump to commemorate US service personnel killed in an attack in Afghanistan three years prior, using it as an opportunity to criticise the Biden administration. Thirteen US service members and more than 100 Afghans were killed during the suicide bombing at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul. The incident occurred as American troops made a chaotic withdrawal from the country, and the Taliban returned to power. Ms Gabbard made frequent criticisms of US military interventionism during her time in Congress. Appearing at Monday's event in Michigan, Ms Gabbard said she was appealing to Democrats, Republicans and independents alike to pick Trump at the ballot box in November - saying it was a matter of \"saving our country and serving the people\". Her official backing of Trump marks the culmination of a remarkable political journey over the last decade that began on the progressive left of the Democratic Party. She was the first Hindu member of the US Congress, going on to serve as vice-chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee - before resigning to endorse the 2016 presidential campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders. When Ms Gabbard ran for president in 2020, she championed liberal issues like government-run healthcare, free college tuition and gun control. But Joe Biden became the Democratic nominee that year, and went on to win the presidency. Ms Gabbard endorsed him, but quit the party two years later. She has since staked out conservative views on issues including abortion and transgender rights, and has become a regular and outspoken guest on Fox News. She has also been accused of spreading \"promoting Russian propaganda\" by officials in Ukraine. By early 2024, she was singing the praises of Mr Biden's rival, Trump, who will this time compete for the White House against Ms Harris. In the subsequent months, it was even speculated that Ms Gabbard could be in the frame as Trump's potential running mate for November - a role that ultimately went to Mr Vance.\n\nEnvironmentalists for Trump\n\nGetty Images Trump and RFK Jr appeared on stage together at a rally in Arizona\n\nMr Kennedy ended his independent presidential campaign on Friday and endorsed Trump, appearing alongside him at a rally in Arizona. The former president's allies have criticised both Mr Kennedy and Mr Gabbard over the years. Only four months ago, Trump called Mr Kennedy a \u201cRadical Left Lunatic\u201d who was \u201cfar more liberal than anyone running as a Democrat\". The two former Democrats are also known for being staunch environmentalists. Trump has promised to ramp up US fossil fuel production and regularly uses the slogan \"Drill, baby, drill!\" at his rallies. Top Democrats were quick to dismiss the endorsements from Ms Gabbard and Mr Kennedy. \u201cRather than focusing on earning the support of hardworking Americans, Trump is more fixated on winning the backing of extremists like Gabbard and RFK Jr \u2014 and they\u2019ll do nothing but weigh down his sinking ship of a campaign,\u201d the party's Rapid Response Director Alex Floyd said in a statement.",

While Harris needs to motivate voters across several generations, she especially needs Millennials and Gen Z.\n\nHarris\u2019 decision to select Minnesota governor Tim Walz as her vice-president indicates that she understands this generational contest, selecting a candidate potentially appealing across generations, but especially to an emerging Millennial and Gen Z voting bloc.\n\nThe 2024 presidential race is now a new campaign reset along many dimensions, including a generational contest between Trump and Harris. What we know is that across the five generations voting this November\u2014the Silents, Baby Boomers, GenX, Millennials, and GenZ\u2014there are profound policy preference differences, with the latter two generations being far more liberal on a range of issues including reproductive rights, voting rights, immigration, LGBTQ+ issues, gun regulation, and many other social issues.\n\nWe also know that in general the Republican and Democratic parties are divided along many dimensions, with there being a generational split with more Silents and Boomers favoring the former, while Gen X,, the Millennials, and GenZ favor the Democrats. But while Biden was a candidate, he was unable to motivate these generational voters, especially in the six or so swing states that will decide the election.\n\nHarris\u2019 choice of Walz challenges conventional wisdom of picking a political moderate in a swing state. Her selection of Walz\u2014a liberal from Minnesota\u2014suggests her campaign is going fully progressive, seeking to motivate these new generations. Its sets up a contrast to Donald Trump whose selection of JD Vance, sets up a clear liberal/conservative and generational voting divide. Both presidential candidates and parties are playing generational base politics.\n\nHarris may be better positioned to play this generational politics than Trump by the simple fact that generational ascendency and descendency are factors in this election. This election features the last gasp of the Silent generation in terms of its influence in American politics. Beginning in 2020 the Baby Boomers no longer were the largest generational voting bloc in America, and are now being eclipsed by the millennials and Gen Z, who in 2020, were 37% of the voting bloc. Now they're nearly 40%. The voters and constituencies Trump is appealing too are literally dying out, while for Harris her supporters are coming of age.\n\nThe Millennials and Gen Z view the two major parties as two stores with two different menus. They are not completely sold on either the Democratic or Republican parties and would like to see more mixing of the different items on the policy menus. This again suggests appealing to them by emphasizing themes of unity and cross-party policy. They are generally liberal on most issues, more centrist on fiscal issues. They remain worried about college education affordability, health care affordability, buying a home, as well as crime, the environment and guns.\n\nThe key to this election is both generating communications that appeal to specific generations, as well as cross generational themes. Each generation looks to different media for its sources of information, and successful campaigns need to use those media to target them with different symbols and themes based on defining events in their life that help them to continue to frame their perspective on the world. Generational politics is real. But it is real in the context at perhaps five or six swing states will decide this presidential election.\n\nIn Harris\u2019 acceptance speech she seemed to acknowledge the reality of the generality differences across the six or so swing states and where 150,000 to 200,000 voters will effectively determine the election. Moreover, her speech drew clear contrasts with Trump and also the tone of all the speeches on the final night of the Democratic National Convention was an effort to appeal to moderate or swing voters. Harris right now is playing the politics of 2024 well and is enjoying a bump in the polls that is putting her into the lead. If this lead is sustained for a few more weeks it may suggest that she has altered the course of the election and could be the next president of the United States.",

        "text": "Analysis: Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s election-season gift to Republicans\nCNN \u2014\n\nMark Zuckerberg is handing Republicans political victories ahead of the 2024 presidential election, acquiescing to years of GOP grievances over his company\u2019s policies.\n\nIn recent days, the Meta chief executive has made newsworthy public statements implicitly supporting right-wing \u201ccensorship\u201d narratives and offered praise for Donald Trump as \u201cbadass\u201d \u2013 even as he claimed he wanted to appear \u201cneutral\u201d and nonpartisan.\n\nOn Monday, Zuckerberg sent a letter to the powerful House Judiciary Committee, stating that the Biden administration had \u201cpressured\u201d Meta to \u201ccensor\u201d content during the pandemic.\n\n\u201cIn 2021, senior officials from the Biden Administration, including the White House, repeatedly pressured our teams for months to censor certain COVID-19 content, including humor and satire, and expressed a lot of frustration with our teams when we didn\u2019t agree,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\n\nThe Meta chief added that the pressure he felt was \u201cwrong\u201d and he came to \u201cregret\u201d that his company, the parent of Facebook and Instagram, was not more outspoken.\n\nThe letter was immediately weaponized by Trump, who used it to once again promote the lie that the 2020 election was stolen.\n\n\u201cZuckerberg admits that the White House pushed to SUPPRESS HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP STORY (& much more!) IN OTHER WORDS, THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WAS RIGGED,\u201d he wrote on his Truth Social platform on Tuesday morning, after Zuckerberg\u2019s letter became public.\n\nThe Republican-led House Judiciary Committee also welcomed Zuckerberg\u2019s letter, posting a copy Monday on s\ufeffocial media and using it to attack President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, who is now running as the Democratic nominee for president. The letter was sent amid a two-year investigation by House Republicans into the content moderation policies of major social media networks.\n\n\u201cMark Zuckerberg just admitted three things: 1. Biden-Harris Admin \u2018pressured\u2019 Facebook to censor Americans. 2. Facebook censored Americans. 3. Facebook throttled the Hunter Biden laptop story. Big win for free speech,\u201d the committee wrote on X.\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for social media companies to reevaluate their approach to content moderation in the run-up to elections, and some experts now believe the companies may have overdone it at times in the 2020 cycle.\n\nBut the decision to make such a disclosure in a letter to the House Judiciary Committee is notable; the committee is chaired by Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, who has repeatedly pushed false rhetoric that the 2020 election was stolen and celebrated the dismantling of academic institutions dedicated to researching election misinformation.\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s decision to describe the White House\u2019s attempts to flag Covid misinformation as pressure and censorship came despite a 6-3 decision this summer by the Supreme Court ruling that the federal government had not overstepped by asking platforms to take down potential misinformation.\n\nBut Zuckerberg\u2019s letter publicly played into the hands of Republicans, who have long falsely claimed that social media platforms colluded with liberal government officials to censor conservative voices. There have been instances, as Zuckerberg has acknowledged, where platforms took down or reduced the spread of dangerous pandemic misinformation or blatant lies about elections, like incorrect locations of polling places, though that occurred under the Trump and Biden administrations.\n\nIn recent years, the platforms run by Zuckerberg and billionaire Trump supporter Elon Musk have eliminated many of the guardrails designed to reduce the spread of viral misinformation, including allowing Trump to return after he was banned in the wake of the January 6 attack.\n\nZuckerberg, who previously donated more than $400 million to enhance access to voting in the US, also told Jordan that he would no longer support election efforts after coming under attack from Republicans, who have argued that the funds, derisively referred to as \u201cZuckerbucks,\u201d helped Biden win key battleground states.\n\n\u201cI know that some people believe this work benefited one party over the other,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMy goal is to be neutral and not play a role one way or another - or to even appear to be playing a role. So I don\u2019t plan on making a similar contribution this cycle.\u201d\n\nAs the Covid-19 pandemic depleted local resources during the 2020 election, private companies like Facebook stepped in to fill the coffers of election offices with these grants. With the explosion of mail-in voting during the pandemic, which requires more resources than in-person voting, counties across the country gladly welcomed the cash. But after Trump lost several key states and counties that took the money, Republicans used it as a scapegoat.\n\nThe decision to cut the funding was hailed as a victory by Republicans, with the judiciary committee celebrating the move.\n\nThe Meta chief also went a step further, telling the committee that the company\u2019s decision to briefly limit sharing of the New York Post\u2019s infamous October 2020 story on Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop was a mistake \u2014 a decision he has previously expressed regret over.\n\nZuckerberg said that it has \u201cbeen made clear that the reporting was not Russian disinformation, and in retrospect, we shouldn\u2019t have demoted the story.\u201d\n\nBut while the contents of the laptop that the Post reported on turned out to be authentic, according to the Justice Department, the New York Post\u2019s reporting in 2020 peddled a false narrative that was being simultaneously pushed by the Russian government. That false narrative claimed Joe Biden had \u201cpressured government officials in Ukraine into firing a prosecutor who was investigating\u201d the Ukrainian gas company Burisma, where his son was on the board.\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s letter comes just weeks after he told Bloomberg that Trump\u2019s reaction to an assassination attempt was \u201cbadass,\u201d even after the former president threatened to send the Meta chief to prison if reelected.\n\n\u201cSeeing Donald Trump get up after getting shot in the face and pump his fist in the air with the American flag is one of the most badass things I\u2019ve ever seen in my life,\u201d he told Bloomberg.\n\nTaken together, the remarks show Zuckerberg offering Republicans an olive branch ahead of the election, and some political ammunition to wit. In the Bloomberg interview, Zuckerberg said Meta had enacted changes to its platforms to reduce the amount of political content reaching users, though it remains unclear what meets that definition.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re going to see our services play less of a role in this election than they have in the past,\u201d he said.",

        "text": "More than 200 former Bush, McCain and Romney staffers endorse Harris\nMore than 200 Republicans who worked for both Bush presidents, the late Sen. John McCain and Sen. Mitt Romney declared their endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 presidential campaign in an open letter released Monday.\n\nThe letter comes after several Republicans who are openly critical of former President Donald Trump delivered remarks at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago last week.\n\nIn their letter, which was first reported by USA Today, the former staff members noted that they had come out against Trump during the 2020 election cycle and said they \"jointly declare that we\u2019re voting for Vice President Kamala Harris and Gov. Tim Walz this November.\"\n\n\"Of course, we have plenty of honest, ideological disagreements with Vice President Harris and Gov. Walz. That\u2019s to be expected,\" they wrote. \"The alternative, however, is simply untenable.\u201d\n\nThe group condemned Trump's policies and Project 2025, a proposed blueprint by the Heritage Foundation for a second Trump term that the former president has sought to distance himself from, saying those proposals \"will hurt real, everyday people and weaken our sacred institutions.\"\n\nThey argued that Trump's approach to foreign policy also poses threats to democratic movements abroad and concluded their letter by imploring moderate Republicans and conservative independents to \"take a brave stand once more, to vote for leaders that will strive for consensus, not chaos; that will work to unite, not divide; that will make our country and our children proud\" by voting for Harris and Walz.\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said in a statement that the letter is \"hilarious because nobody knows who these people are. They would rather see the country burn down than to see President Trump successfully return to the White House to Make America Great Again.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMcCain's former chief of staff Mark Salter and Olivia Troye, a former aide to Vice President Mike Pence, signed the letter. Troye spoke out against Trump at the Democratic National Convention last week.\n\nThe group joins more than two dozen Republicans \u2014 former governors, members of Congress and Trump administration officials who are vocal critics of Trump \u2014 who pledged support for Harris' presidential campaign this month.\n\nA similar group of anti-Trump Republicans, including several hundred former aides to George W. Bush and McCain, endorsed Biden\u2019s 2020 presidential election campaign.\n\nBush, McCain and Romney spoke out against Trump for his inflammatory remarks and were targets of the former president\u2019s attacks. (McCain, of Arizona, died in 2018, a decade after being the GOP presidential nominee; Romney, of Utah, was the party's nominee in 2012.)\n\nBush, whose brother Jeb Bush ran against Trump in the 2016 Republican presidential primary, did not attend the Republican National Convention last month. He has not publicly criticized Trump, but he did hold a 2021 fundraiser for then-Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., a vocal Trump critic who served as vice chair of the House Jan. 6 committee.\n\nMcCain said in 2016 that he couldn\u2019t back Trump or Democrat Hillary Clinton, citing Trump\u2019s inflammatory comments about women. His wife, Cindy McCain, later endorsed Biden in the 2020 election.\n\nRomney, who voted twice to convict Trump at his impeachment trials, has repeatedly denounced the former president and said he is putting the country\u2019s future in peril.",

        "text": "Key things to know about U.S. election polling in 2024\n(J Studios/Getty Images)\n\nConfidence in U.S. public opinion polling was shaken by errors in 2016 and 2020. In both years\u2019 general elections, many polls underestimated the strength of Republican candidates, including Donald Trump. These errors laid bare some real limitations of polling.\n\nIn the midterms that followed those elections, polling performed better. But many Americans remain skeptical that it can paint an accurate portrait of the public\u2019s political preferences.\n\nRestoring people\u2019s confidence in polling is an important goal, because robust and independent public polling has a critical role to play in a democratic society. It gathers and publishes information about the well-being of the public and about citizens\u2019 views on major issues. And it provides an important counterweight to people in power, or those seeking power, when they make claims about \u201cwhat the people want.\u201d\n\nThe challenges facing polling are undeniable. In addition to the longstanding issues of rising nonresponse and cost, summer 2024 brought extraordinary events that transformed the presidential race. The good news is that people with deep knowledge of polling are working hard to fix the problems exposed in 2016 and 2020, experimenting with more data sources and interview approaches than ever before. Still, polls are more useful to the public if people have realistic expectations about what surveys can do well \u2013 and what they cannot.\n\nWith that in mind, here are some key points to know about polling heading into this year\u2019s presidential election.\n\nTerminology Probability sampling (or \u201crandom sampling\u201d). This refers to a polling method in which survey participants are recruited using random sampling from a database or list that includes nearly everyone in the population. The pollster selects the sample. The survey is not open for anyone who wants to sign up. Online opt-in polling (or \u201cnonprobability sampling\u201d). These polls are recruited using a variety of methods that are sometimes referred to as \u201cconvenience sampling.\u201d Respondents come from a variety of online sources such as ads on social media or search engines, websites offering rewards in exchange for survey participation, or self-enrollment. Unlike surveys with probability samples, people can volunteer to participate in opt-in surveys. Nonresponse and nonresponse bias. Nonresponse is when someone sampled for a survey does not participate. Nonresponse bias occurs when the pattern of nonresponse leads to error in a poll estimate. For example, college graduates are more likely than those without a degree to participate in surveys, leading to the potential that the share of college graduates in the resulting sample will be too high. Mode of interview. This refers to the format in which respondents are presented with and respond to survey questions. The most common modes are online, live telephone, text message and paper. Some polls use more than one mode. Weighting. This is a statistical procedure pollsters perform to make their survey align with the broader population on key characteristics like age, race, etc. For example, if a survey has too many college graduates compared with their share in the population, people without a college degree are \u201cweighted up\u201d to match the proper share.\n\nHow are election polls being conducted?\n\nPollsters are making changes in response to the problems in previous elections. As a result, polling is different today than in 2016. Most U.S. polling organizations that conducted and publicly released national surveys in both 2016 and 2022 (61%) used methods in 2022 that differed from what they used in 2016. And change has continued since 2022.\n\nOne change is that the number of active polling organizations has grown significantly, indicating that there are fewer barriers to entry into the polling field. The number of organizations that conduct national election polls more than doubled between 2000 and 2022.\n\nThis growth has been driven largely by pollsters using inexpensive opt-in sampling methods. But previous Pew Research Center analyses have demonstrated how surveys that use nonprobability sampling may have errors twice as large, on average, as those that use probability sampling.\n\nThe second change is that many of the more prominent polling organizations that use probability sampling \u2013 including Pew Research Center \u2013 have shifted from conducting polls primarily by telephone to using online methods, or some combination of online, mail and telephone. The result is that polling methodologies are far more diverse now than in the past.\n\n(For more about how public opinion polling works, including a chapter on election polls, read our short online course on public opinion polling basics.)\n\nAll good polling relies on statistical adjustment called \u201cweighting,\u201d which makes sure that the survey sample aligns with the broader population on key characteristics. Historically, public opinion researchers have adjusted their data using a core set of demographic variables to correct imbalances between the survey sample and the population.\n\nBut there is a growing realization among survey researchers that weighting a poll on just a few variables like age, race and gender is insufficient for getting accurate results. Some groups of people \u2013 such as older adults and college graduates \u2013 are more likely to take surveys, which can lead to errors that are too sizable for a simple three- or four-variable adjustment to work well. Adjusting on more variables produces more accurate results, according to Center studies in 2016 and 2018.\n\nA number of pollsters have taken this lesson to heart. For example, recent high-quality polls by Gallup and The New York Times/Siena College adjusted on eight and 12 variables, respectively. Our own polls typically adjust on 12 variables. In a perfect world, it wouldn\u2019t be necessary to have that much intervention by the pollster. But the real world of survey research is not perfect.\n\nPre-election polls face one critical challenge that the routine opinion poll does not: determining which of the people surveyed will cast a ballot. (procurator via Getty Images)\n\nPredicting who will vote is critical \u2013 and difficult. Preelection polls face one crucial challenge that routine opinion polls do not: determining who of the people surveyed will actually cast a ballot.\n\nRoughly a third of eligible Americans do not vote in presidential elections, despite the enormous attention paid to these contests. Determining who will abstain is difficult because people can\u2019t perfectly predict their future behavior \u2013 and because many people feel social pressure to say they\u2019ll vote even if it\u2019s unlikely.\n\nNo one knows the profile of voters ahead of Election Day. We can\u2019t know for sure whether young people will turn out in greater numbers than usual, or whether key racial or ethnic groups will do so. This means pollsters are left to make educated guesses about turnout, often using a mix of historical data and current measures of voting enthusiasm. This is very different from routine opinion polls, which mostly do not ask about people\u2019s future intentions.\n\nWhen major news breaks, a poll\u2019s timing can matter. Public opinion on most issues is remarkably stable, so you don\u2019t necessarily need a recent poll about an issue to get a sense of what people think about it. But dramatic events can and do change public opinion, especially when people are first learning about a new topic. For example, polls this summer saw notable changes in voter attitudes following Joe Biden\u2019s withdrawal from the presidential race. Polls taken immediately after a major event may pick up a shift in public opinion, but those shifts are sometimes short-lived. Polls fielded weeks or months later are what allow us to see whether an event has had a long-term impact on the public\u2019s psyche.\n\nHow accurate are polls?\n\nThe answer to this question depends on what you want polls to do. Polls are used for all kinds of purposes in addition to showing who\u2019s ahead and who\u2019s behind in a campaign. Fair or not, however, the accuracy of election polling is usually judged by how closely the polls matched the outcome of the election.\n\nBy this standard, polling in 2016 and 2020 performed poorly. In both years, state polling was characterized by serious errors. National polling did reasonably well in 2016 but faltered in 2020.\n\nIn 2020, a post-election review of polling by the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) found that \u201cthe 2020 polls featured polling error of an unusual magnitude: It was the highest in 40 years for the national popular vote and the highest in at least 20 years for state-level estimates of the vote in presidential, senatorial, and gubernatorial contests.\u201d\n\nHow big were the errors? Polls conducted in the last two weeks before the election suggested that Biden\u2019s margin over Trump was nearly twice as large as it ended up being in the final national vote tally.\n\nErrors of this size make it difficult to be confident about who is leading if the election is closely contested, as many U.S. elections are.\n\nPollsters are rightly working to improve the accuracy of their polls. But even an error of 4 or 5 percentage points isn\u2019t too concerning if the purpose of the poll is to describe whether the public has favorable or unfavorable opinions about candidates, or to show which issues matter to which voters. And on questions that gauge where people stand on issues, we usually want to know broadly where the public stands. We don\u2019t necessarily need to know the precise share of Americans who say, for example, that climate change is mostly caused by human activity. Even judged by its performance in recent elections, polling can still provide a faithful picture of public sentiment on the important issues of the day.\n\nThe 2022 midterms saw generally accurate polling, despite a wave of partisan polls predicting a broad Republican victory. In fact, FiveThirtyEight found that \u201cpolls were more accurate in 2022 than in any cycle since at least 1998, with almost no bias toward either party.\u201d Moreover, a handful of contrarian polls that predicted a 2022 \u201cred wave\u201d largely washed out when the votes were tallied. In sum, if we focus on polling in the most recent national election, there\u2019s plenty of reason to be encouraged.\n\nCompared with other elections in the past 20 years, polls have been less accurate when Donald Trump is on the ballot. Preelection surveys suffered from large errors \u2013 especially at the state level \u2013 in 2016 and 2020, when Trump was standing for election. But they performed reasonably well in the 2018 and 2022 midterms, when he was not.\n\nPew Research Center illustration\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, observers speculated about the possibility that Trump supporters might be less willing to express their support to a pollster \u2013 a phenomenon sometimes described as the \u201cshy Trump effect.\u201d But a committee of polling experts evaluated five different tests of the \u201cshy Trump\u201d theory and turned up little to no evidence for each one. Later, Pew Research Center and, in a separate test, a researcher from Yale also found little to no evidence in support of the claim.\n\nInstead, two other explanations are more likely. One is about the difficulty of estimating who will turn out to vote. Research has found that Trump is popular among people who tend to sit out midterms but turn out for him in presidential election years. Since pollsters often use past turnout to predict who will vote, it can be difficult to anticipate when irregular voters will actually show up.\n\nThe other explanation is that Republicans in the Trump era have become a little less likely than Democrats to participate in polls. Pollsters call this \u201cpartisan nonresponse bias.\u201d Surprisingly, polls historically have not shown any particular pattern of favoring one side or the other. The errors that favored Democratic candidates in the past eight years may be a result of the growth of political polarization, along with declining trust among conservatives in news organizations and other institutions that conduct polls.\n\nWhatever the cause, the fact that Trump is again the nominee of the Republican Party means that pollsters must be especially careful to make sure all segments of the population are properly represented in surveys.\n\nThe real margin of error is often about double the one reported. A typical election poll sample of about 1,000 people has a margin of sampling error that\u2019s about plus or minus 3 percentage points. That number expresses the uncertainty that results from taking a sample of the population rather than interviewing everyone. Random samples are likely to differ a little from the population just by chance, in the same way that the quality of your hand in a card game varies from one deal to the next.\n\nThe problem is that sampling error is not the only kind of error that affects a poll. Those other kinds of error, in fact, can be as large or larger than sampling error. Consequently, the reported margin of error can lead people to think that polls are more accurate than they really are.\n\nThere are three other, equally important sources of error in polling: noncoverage error, where not all the target population has a chance of being sampled; nonresponse error, where certain groups of people may be less likely to participate; and measurement error, where people may not properly understand the questions or misreport their opinions. Not only does the margin of error fail to account for those other sources of potential error, putting a number only on sampling error implies to the public that other kinds of error do not exist.\n\nSeveral recent studies show that the average total error in a poll estimate may be closer to twice as large as that implied by a typical margin of sampling error. This hidden error underscores the fact that polls may not be precise enough to call the winner in a close election.\n\nOther important things to remember\n\nTransparency in how a poll was conducted is associated with better accuracy. The polling industry has several platforms and initiatives aimed at promoting transparency in survey methodology. These include AAPOR\u2019s transparency initiative and the Roper Center archive. Polling organizations that participate in these organizations have less error, on average, than those that don\u2019t participate, an analysis by FiveThirtyEight found.\n\nParticipation in these transparency efforts does not guarantee that a poll is rigorous, but it is undoubtedly a positive signal. Transparency in polling means disclosing essential information, including the poll\u2019s sponsor, the data collection firm, where and how participants were selected, modes of interview, field dates, sample size, question wording, and weighting procedures.\n\nThere is evidence that when the public is told that a candidate is extremely likely to win, some people may be less likely to vote. Following the 2016 election, many people wondered whether the pervasive forecasts that seemed to all but guarantee a Hillary Clinton victory \u2013 two modelers put her chances at 99% \u2013 led some would-be voters to conclude that the race was effectively over and that their vote would not make a difference. There is scientific research to back up that claim: A team of researchers found experimental evidence that when people have high confidence that one candidate will win, they are less likely to vote. This helps explain why some polling analysts say elections should be covered using traditional polling estimates and margins of error rather than speculative win probabilities (also known as \u201cprobabilistic forecasts\u201d).\n\nNational polls tell us what the entire public thinks about the presidential candidates, but the outcome of the election is determined state by state in the Electoral College. The 2000 and 2016 presidential elections demonstrated a difficult truth: The candidate with the largest share of support among all voters in the United States sometimes loses the election. In those two elections, the national popular vote winners (Al Gore and Hillary Clinton) lost the election in the Electoral College (to George W. Bush and Donald Trump). In recent years, analysts have shown that Republican candidates do somewhat better in the Electoral College than in the popular vote because every state gets three electoral votes regardless of population \u2013 and many less-populated states are rural and more Republican.\n\nFor some, this raises the question: What is the use of national polls if they don\u2019t tell us who is likely to win the presidency? In fact, national polls try to gauge the opinions of all Americans, regardless of whether they live in a battleground state like Pennsylvania, a reliably red state like Idaho or a reliably blue state like Rhode Island. In short, national polls tell us what the entire citizenry is thinking. Polls that focus only on the competitive states run the risk of giving too little attention to the needs and views of the vast majority of Americans who live in uncompetitive states \u2013 about 80%.\n\nFortunately, this is not how most pollsters view the world. As the noted political scientist Sidney Verba explained, \u201cSurveys produce just what democracy is supposed to produce \u2013 equal representation of all citizens.\u201d",

        "text": "Trump special counsel files new election interference indictment\nTrump faces revised 2020 election interference charges\n\nGetty Images\n\nUS prosecutors have issued revised charges against Donald Trump for the former president's alleged attempts to interfere in the 2020 election after losing the contest. The updated wording tries to navigate a Supreme Court ruling that presidents have broad immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts. The ruling had thrown this case into doubt. Trump denies accusations that he pressured officials to reverse the results, knowingly spread lies about election fraud and sought to exploit a riot at the US Capitol to delay the certification of Joe Biden's victory. It appears unlikely the case - and other criminal cases he faces - will reach court before the next election on 5 November.\n\nThe revised indictment, brought by Department of Justice (DoJ) Special Counsel Jack Smith, leaves in place the four crimes Trump is accused of committing: conspiracy to defraud the US, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, attempting to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights. But these now relate to Trump's status as a political candidate rather than a sitting president. Trump has partial immunity from prosecution, Supreme Court rules Trump has previously pleaded not guilty to all charges. He wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform that the fresh indictment was \"an effort to resurrect a 'dead' Witch Hunt\" and \"distract the American People\" from this year's election. He called for it to be \"dismissed IMMEDIATELY\". His campaign has not responded to a BBC request for comment. But a source close to his legal team told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, the second indictment \"was not a surprise\". \"This is what the government is supposed to do based on what the Supreme Court did,\" the source said. \"It doesn't change our position that we believe Smith's case is flawed and it should be dismissed.\"\n\nWhat's changed - and what hasn't?\n\nThe new charging document - which was slimmed down from 45 to 36 pages - re-works the language of the allegations to respond to last month's ruling on presidential immunity by the Supreme Court. It argues Trump acted as a private citizen - and not as president - when he undertook the alleged scheme to sway the election. \u201cThe defendant had no official responsibilities related to the certification proceeding, but he did have a personal interest as a candidate in being named the winner of the election,\u201d reads one new line in the indictment. Another new line refers to a lawsuit filed by Trump's campaign in Georgia. The old language said the suit was \u201cfiled in his name\u201d, but the updated indictment says it was \u201cfiled in his capacity as a candidate for president\u201d. The new document also appears to have removed the charges against Jeffrey Clark - a former DoJ official who played a key role in the so-called fake electors scheme, according to prosecutors. Mr Clark was not named in either indictment, but has been identified in the media through public records. The fresh indictment also drops the claim that Trump tried to pressure DoJ officials to work to overturn his defeat. The high court ruled Trump's direction to justice officials was not illegal. The special counsel's office said the superseding indictment had been presented to a new grand jury that had not previously heard evidence in the case. A grand jury is set up by a prosecutor to determine whether there is enough evidence to pursue a prosecution.\n\nThe new indictment leaves in place several key allegations against Trump, including that he attempted to persuade Vice-President Mike Pence to obstruct Mr Biden\u2019s election certification. That is despite the fact that conversations between Trump and Mr Pence would probably fall under the category of \"official\" acts, for which Trump has immunity from prosecution, according to the Supreme Court ruling. The revised indictment showed that Mr Smith interpreted the Supreme Court ruling to mean that his case could still move forward, said Prof Daniel Richman, a constitutional law expert at Columbia Law School. But whether it would satisfy the Supreme Court's presidential immunity framework remained unclear, Prof Richman told the BBC. \"The court was painfully vague as to what private conduct done by a president can be charged criminally,\" he said.\n\nReuters Trump is accused of trying to thwart Joe Biden's victory at the last election - including by exploiting a riot at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021\n\nTrump's other legal issues\n\nThe revised indictment would not necessarily expedite the case, Prof Richman said. He doubted it would be heard before the 2024 election. The CBS News source close to Trump's legal team said the former president's lawyers would ask for more time to prepare for the case. They said this would likely delay the start of the trial if the judge agreed. This case came together after Mr Smith was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland in 2022 to oversee two federal investigations into Trump: the election interference case and another case in which the ex-president has been accused of taking classified documents back to his Florida home after leaving office. On Monday, Mr Smith\u2019s team appealed against the decision of a Florida judge to dismiss the latter case. Judge Aileen Cannon had done so on the grounds that the mere existence of special counsels violated the US Constitution. Mr Smith argued the judge's view \"deviated\" from legal precedent. A guide to Trump's criminal cases Both cases face uncertain futures after the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark decision. The same is true of a separate case in Georgia, in which Trump and 18 other defendants are also accused of criminally conspiring to overturn his narrow defeat in 2020. He has pleaded not guilty, and a trial date has not been set. Meanwhile, Trump awaits sentencing after being convicted in New York in May of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments made to a porn star. If Trump defeats Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in November, he is widely expected to order officials to drop all the remaining federal charges that he faces.",

        "text": "US election process explained: This is how the next president will be elected\nAs the countdown to the United States general election begins, the nation is immersed in a whirlwind of political debates, campaign rallies, fundraisers, endorsements, and relentless social media chatter, all aimed at determining the next occupant of the White House. US election process explained as Republican presidential candidate former President Donald to take on Democrat presidential candidate Kamala Harris in one of the tightest contests ever.(AP)\n\nWhile former President Donald Trump is confident about reclaiming the White House throne, Vice President Kamala Harris is proving to be a formidable obstacle, making the race more intense than ever. As the political noise reaches a crescendo, here\u2019s a breakdown of how the United States will elect its next president.\n\nThe Road to the White House: The timeline\n\nThe U.S. presidential election process is a complex journey divided into several key phases: primaries and caucuses, national conventions, the general election campaign, and the Electoral College vote.\n\n1. Understanding Primaries and Caucuses: January to June\n\nThe journey to the White House began in early 2023, with various candidates announcing their intentions to run for president. Joe Biden emerged as the most prominent Democratic contender, while Donald Trump faced a crowded Republican field, including Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, and Indian-American entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nThe primaries and caucuses, were then held in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories. These events were essential in determining the presidential nominees for the two major political parties: the Democrats and the Republicans.\n\nTrump, who had maintained a strong lead in the polls since 2020, confidently skipped all GOP debates, believing his nomination was secure. Nikki Haley gained some momentum in late 2023, but none of Trump\u2019s challengers could match his polling numbers, leading most to eventually withdraw from the race.\n\nDuring primary elections, registered voters cast ballots for their preferred candidate, while states like Iowa used caucuses, which involve local meetings where party members vote on their preferred candidates.\n\nThe results of these primaries and caucuses determined how many delegates each candidate would have at their party\u2019s national convention. Delegates are representatives who pledge to support a specific candidate at the convention.\n\n2. National Conventions: July to August\n\nAfter the primaries and caucuses, the Democratic and Republican parties hold their national conventions, usually in the summer before the general election. These conventions are major political events, featuring speeches, rallies, and the official nomination of each party\u2019s candidate for president and vice president.\n\nThis year months before the national convention Joe Biden and Donald Trump enjoyed full support and majority to be the candidates, however Biden had to end his race amidst widespread concerns over his age and mental ability to contest. Soon after his disastrous performance during presidential debate against Donald Trump Biden decided to step aside and handover the baton to Kamala Harris.\n\nWithin weeks before the national convention Kamala surged unopposed to become the parties presidential candidate with endorsements from Obama, Nancy Pelosi, Clintons and majority Democrat members.\n\nBefore the conventions the presidential candidates announced their running mates, Kamala Haris picked Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Donald Trump opted for senator JD Vance.\n\nAt the conventions, delegates formally casted their votes for their candidate who then secured a majority of delegates becomes the party\u2019s nominee. Traditionally the outcome of the conventions has been largely a formality, as the presumptive nominees typically secure enough delegates during the primaries.\n\n3. The General Election Campaign: September to October\n\nOnce the nominees are confirmed, the general election campaign kicks into high gear. This phase involves intense campaigning across the country, with candidates making their case to the American people through rallies, debates, advertisements, and social media. The general election campaign is characterized by several key elements:\n\nPresidential debates, often held between September and October, are crucial moments in the campaign. This year Trump and Kamala have agreed for presidential debate on ABC News on 10 September. Whereas vice presidential candidates Vance and Walz will debate on CBS News on October 1.\n\nCampaigns invest in extensive voter outreach efforts, including grassroots organizing, phone banking, and get-out-the-vote drives, to mobilize their supporters.\n\n4. US Election Day: November 5, 2024\n\nElection Day, held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November, is when voters across the country cast their ballots for the presidential candidates. This year it falls on November 5, 2024. However, unlike in many other democracies, the U.S. president is not elected directly by the popular vote. Instead, the Electoral College plays a decisive role.\n\nUnderstanding The Electoral College: A Unique System\n\nThe U.S. Electoral College is a unique and sometimes controversial aspect of the American election process. Each state is allocated a certain number of electors based on its representation in Congress\u2014this includes the number of Senators (always two) and the number of Representatives (which varies by state population). There are 538 electors in total, and a candidate needs a majority of 270 electoral votes to win the presidency.\n\n5. Electoral Vote: Counting in December, 2024\n\nAfter Election Day, electors meet in their respective states in December to cast their electoral votes. These votes are then sent to Congress, where they are counted in early January. The candidate who receives a majority of the electoral votes is officially declared the next president of the United States.\n\nWhat Happens if No Candidate Wins a Majority?\n\nIn the rare event that no candidate wins a majority of the electoral votes, the election is decided by the House of Representatives. Each state delegation in the House gets one vote, and the candidate who receives a majority of the votes becomes president. The Senate selects the vice president in a similar process.\n\n6. Presidential Inauguration Day: January 20\n\nThe final step in the election process is the inauguration, held on January 20th of the year following the election. On this day, the president-elect takes the Oath of Office, administered by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and officially begins their four-year term.",

        "text": "There\u2019s a fair way to ensure third-party candidates don\u2019t \u2018spoil\u2019 the US election | David Daley\nRobert F Kennedy Jr has suspended his presidential campaign and endorsed Donald Trump, in part because he did not want to be a spoiler across competitive swing states. The third-party \u201cspoiler problem\u201d, unfortunately, will not vanish with him.\n\nThree committed independents and third-party nominees remain: progressive activist Cornel West, Libertarian Chase Oliver, and Jill Stein of the Green party. They could still tip the balance: the White House looks likely to be won by the tiniest margins across just seven swing states, just as it was in 2016 and 2020.\n\nThe next president should not be decided by whether Stein earns 0.4% in Michigan or 0.2%, or if Oliver claims 1.1% or 0.8% in Libertarian-friendly Georgia and Arizona. But under our current system, that\u2019s very much possible.\n\nWe need a modern fix that recognizes that third parties are here to stay, but also that a nation with a guiding principle of majority rule deserves winners who earn more than 50% of their fellow Americans\u2019 votes. The best solution to the urgent \u201cspoiler\u201d problem \u2013 which we\u2019ve been exhaustingly debating since Ross Perot\u2019s run in 1992 \u2013 is ranked-choice voting (RCV).\n\nTwo states \u2013 Maine and Alaska \u2013 have already adopted this common-sense, nonpartisan fix for fairer results and will vote for president this fall with RCV. Others should follow their lead. RCV has lots of benefits. But most crucially, by giving voters the power to rank the field, it fixes the spoiler effect that emerges in any race with more than two candidates.\n\nA RCV election works much like an instant runoff. If someone wins a majority of voters\u2019 first choices, they win \u2013 like any other election. If not, the last-place finishers are eliminated, one by one, and their supporters\u2019 second choices come into play to identify a majority winner.\n\nIn other words, a Democrat in Michigan who wants a different approach in Gaza could feel free to rank West or Stein first, and Kamala Harris second. A Sun belt conservative who thinks the national debt grew too quickly under Trump could put Oliver first and the former president second. They could make their voice heard \u2013 without worrying that their vote would elect someone they fear could be worse on the issue most important to them.\n\nCurrently, despite our political nuances and the increasing number of registered independents, the spoiler problem continues to be the prism through which every third-party run is considered. Kennedy never seemed likely to win, but pundits agonized for months over whether he drew more from Democrats or the Republican party. It\u2019s no surprise that serious independent candidates or anti-Trump conservatives such as Larry Hogan and Chris Christie rejected entreaties to run this year, when such a run would be reduced to the question of who they\u2019d \u201csiphon\u201d votes from.\n\nIt\u2019s too early to judge the effect that Kennedy\u2019s exit will have on the race. His support had softened in recent weeks. Yet almost no matter how his supporters break, the most competitive states remain extremely close.\n\nAs of 21 August, Harris leads Arizona by 1.2%, Pennsylvania by 1.6%, and North Carolina by 0.2%. Trump holds a lead of 0.8% in Georgia. Any of the remaining third-party candidates could easily exceed the margin of victory in competitive states. It\u2019s not just Florida in 2000, when George W Bush carried the electoral college tipping-point by 537 votes, a margin far surpassed by Ralph Nader voters. In Wisconsin in 2020, the Libertarian Jo Jorgensen and conservative-leaning independents took more than twice as many votes as the margin between Joe Biden and Trump.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to imagine something similar this year, perhaps even an election night 2024 where the electoral college is knotted up. Harris and Trump each have 251 electoral votes. Arizona, Michigan and Wisconsin remain too close to call, each separated by a handful of votes. A tense nation awaits the verdict.\n\nWouldn\u2019t the result have more legitimacy if everyone knew that the electoral votes in those states went to a winner with more than 50% of the vote?\n\nKennedy might have left the scene, but third-party candidates are not going away. Nor should they be forced out. We can adjust to that reality, or we can dig in our heels, repeat this tired debate, blame Ralph Nader and Jill Stein for everything, forever, and \u2013 at a time when the country feels ever more polarized \u2013 risk electing a president without a majority in the decisive states, leaving us even more divided than we are now.\n\nThere\u2019s no silver bullet to everything that ails our civic spirit. Yet the road out of this toxicity might begin with embracing values that most of us hold dear: more individual choice is good, all of us should be heard and majorities must rule. Ranked-choice voting makes that possible.",

The sooner a candidate declares their candidacy, the higher the costs can climb. Democratic candidate Kamala Harris declared her candidacy for the 2024 polls far later in the race (July 12, 2024) as compared to Republic candidate Donald Trump (November 15, 2023) as a result of the Joe Biden resignation fiasco.There are no restrictions on how early someone can start campaigning, nor are there limits on how much they can spend. For some candidates, expenses can reach up to $1 billion.Traveling across the country for months and even years, funding advertisements, and paying campaign staff all contribute to the hefty price tag.Contributions or donations are the primary means of campaign funding . Political parties, charitable organizations, and political action committees often pool resources to keep campaigns running.Since 1976, candidates have had the option to use a public financing system to fund their campaigns. Up until the 2000 elections, all presidential nominees participated in this system by accepting government funds in return for agreeing to a spending limit.However, this system eventually lost its appeal when major candidates discovered they could often raise more money from private sources.Federal law, though, prohibits corporations and labor unions from making direct donations to candidates or national party committees. It also imposes limits on the amount of money that individuals and political action organizations can contribute to campaigns and parties.In a little more than a month into her official race for the White House Oval Office, Harris reportedly raised $540 million, with an especial surge in funding during the Democratic National Convention. Harris\u2019s campaign manager, Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon said that this was in addition to the $84 million that her campaign raised specifically during the DNC week.On the other hand, media reports state that business mogul Trump's campaign raised around $138.7 million in July; totaling $327 million in cash on hand at the start of August. According to records with the Federal Election Commission, the Trump campaign raised $268.5 million from January, 2023 to July 31, 2024, reported Forbes.",

        "text": "The 5 Closest Presidential Elections in US History\nEvery four years, tens of millions of Americans head to the polls to register their choice for president. Thanks to the nature of the electoral college, not all of those votes are created equal. It\u2019s possible for a candidate to receive more popular votes than their opponent, but still lose the election (it\u2019s happened five times).\n\nAmerica 101: What is the Electoral College?\n\nSo if you\u2019re starting to question if your vote really counts, consider that sometimes a presidential election can be decided by just a few thousand votes\u2014actual votes, not electoral ones\u2014or even a few hundred.\n\nHere are five American presidential elections with the narrowest margins of victory, ranked from largest to smallest.\n\n1. 1824: A Four-Way Electoral Split\n\nGetty Images John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson.\n\nThe historic 1824 presidential election saw four candidates\u2014all from the same political party\u2014running for the nation\u2019s highest office. The Federalists imploded after the death of Alexander Hamilton, leaving the Democratic-Republicans with an easy path to the presidency. The challenge was choosing a candidate.\n\nThis was an era before national conventions or any organized way of nominating a presidential candidate. As a result, regional factions of Democratic-Republicans threw their support behind four different men, each with high hopes of becoming president: John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay, Andrew Jackson and William H. Crawford.\n\nWhen the ballots from all 24 states were tallied, Andrew Jackson received the most electoral votes (99), followed by Adams (84), Crawford (41) and Clay (37). While Crawford and Clay finished a distant third and fourth, the fragmentation of the Democratic-Republicans prevented any single candidate from winning a majority of the electoral college.\n\n\u201cThe 1824 election is close, in a sense, because it\u2019s a very fractured result,\u201d says Edward Foley, an election law expert at The Ohio State University.\n\nThe Constitution says that if no candidate receives a majority of electoral college votes (in 1824, the magic number was 131), then the vote goes to the House of Representatives. According to the 12th Amendment, only the top three electoral vote-getters move on to the House, so Clay was out of the race.\n\nWhat followed were months of lobbying and horse trading as each state decided which candidate to support. A decisive moment came when Clay, who was serving as Speaker of the House, went against the wishes of his home state of Kentucky and backed Adams instead of Jackson. Adams ended up winning the House vote and therefore the presidency.\n\nJackson was furious when Adams turned around and chose Clay as his Secretary of State. Jackson called Clay a \u201cJudas\u201d and accused Adams and Clay of engaging in a \u201ccorrupt bargain\u201d to steal the election from Jackson.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s correct to say that the election was stolen or corrupt in any conventional sense of the term,\u201d says Foley, author of Ballot Battles: The History of Disputed Elections in the United States. \u201cGiven the lack of a majority, different factions are entitled to negotiate a coalition, like they do in parliamentary governments. The Clay faction united with the Adams faction against the Jackson faction.\u201d\n\nJackson got the last laugh when he trounced Adams in a presidential rematch in 1828.\n\n2. 1916 Election Came Down to California\n\nLibrary of Congress Charles Evans Hughes, Governor of New York, in 1908.\n\nToday, California carries a whopping 54 electoral votes, more than any other state. But back in 1916, the state\u2019s geographically scattered population hovered around 3 million people, giving California just 13 electoral votes.\n\nAs it turned out, California\u2019s 13 electoral votes were enough to swing the 1916 presidential election, and the difference between the state\u2019s electoral winner and loser was a mere 3,420 votes.\n\nThe presidential race in 1916 was between Woodrow Wilson, the Democratic incumbent, and Republican Charles Evans Hughes. Hughes is not a household name today, but he was a popular politician from New York and a Supreme Court justice. In fact, Hughes was the first Supreme Court justice to step down from the bench in order to run for president.\n\nThe Republicans picked Hughes in an attempt to heal their fractured party. In the previous election of 1912, former President Teddy Roosevelt split from the Republicans to run a third-party campaign as the progressive \u201cBull Moose\u201d candidate. Roosevelt won the most electoral votes (88) of any third-party candidate in history, but essentially handed the victory to Wilson by splitting the Republican vote.\n\nIn 1916, Hughes\u2019s job was to appeal to both the progressive and conservative factions of the Republican party, and he had his work cut out for him in California. That year, two California Republicans were vying for a seat in the Senate: progressive Hiram Johnson and conservative William Booth. The Hughes campaign needed to appeal to California Republicans backing both men in order to carry the state.\n\nJust months before the election, Hughes made an unpardonable error. While on a campaign visit to Long Beach, California, Hughes stayed at the same hotel as Johnson, but didn\u2019t invite the California politician for a drink or even a chat. Hughes swore that he had no idea Johnson was at the hotel, but Johnson insisted he was snubbed. Fuming at the insult, Johnson refused to campaign for Hughes in California.\n\nWithout Johnson\u2019s support, the presidential race in California between Hughes and Wilson was incredibly tight. When the votes were finally tallied, Wilson received 465,936 votes and Hughes got 462,516, a difference of 3,420 votes or 0.34 percent of all votes cast in California.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s 13 electoral votes gave the 1916 election to Wilson, who won 277 to 254.\n\nWith such a small margin of victory in California, the Hughes campaign hired lawyers to dig up evidence to argue for a recount.\n\n\u201cBut ultimately, Hughes and the Republicans said, \u2018We can\u2019t find anything,\u2019\u201d says Foley. \u201cThree thousand votes in California made the difference.\u201d\n\nIf Hughes had met Johnson for a drink, he might have been the U.S. president during World War I.\n\n3. 1884: Decided by 1,047 Votes\n\nLibrary of Congress James G. Blaine from Maine (left) and Grover Cleveland from New York faced off in 1884.\n\nThe 1884 election was somehow even closer than 1916. In this earlier election, the swing state in play was New York, the most populous state in the Union carrying 36 electoral votes.\n\nGrover Cleveland, the Democratic candidate, should have had an easy path to office. Cleveland was governor of New York and rose to prominence for his anti-corruption crusades against Tammany Hall. The Democrats had a vice grip on the Southern states, so all Cleveland needed to do to win the election was to take his home state of New York. The Republican candidate, James G. Blaine from Maine, didn\u2019t look like he had a chance.\n\nThen came the scandal. Cleveland, whose supporters praised him for his moral rectitude, was accused of fathering a child out of wedlock and abandoning the mother. Republican-leaning newspapers ran a mocking cartoon of a young boy crying, \u201cMa, Ma, Where\u2019s my Pa?\u201d\n\nLibrary of Congress A September 1884 cartoon mocking Grover Cleveland who was accused of fathering a child out of wedlock and abandoning the mother.\n\nCleveland didn\u2019t deny the accusation, and his campaign tried to refocus the race on political issues, not personal foibles. But Cleveland\u2019s reputation and popularity took a hit.\n\nAs a result, the presidential race in New York went from a \u201csure thing\u201d for Cleveland to an absolute barn burner. In the end, Cleveland received 563,048 votes in New York to Blaine\u2019s 562,001. That\u2019s a razor-thin margin of victory of 1,047 votes or 0.09 percent of all votes cast in the state.\n\nWith New York\u2019s 36 electoral votes, Cleveland narrowly defeated Blaine 219 to 182.\n\nEven though it\u2019s one of the closest elections in U.S. history, the 1884 race doesn\u2019t always make the list of hotly contested elections. Foley thinks that\u2019s because Blaine and the Republicans accepted the results without fighting them in court.\n\n\u201cThe 1884 election doesn't get a lot of attention, because it didn\u2019t spin out of control and get ugly,\u201d says Foley. \u201cIt\u2019s an example of a success story, really. Both sides lawyered up and really inspected the ballots closely, but the Republicans accepted defeat when it showed that they lost.\u201d\n\n4. 1876: Republicans Win by One Electoral Vote\n\nLibrary of Congress Samuel J. Tilden (left) and Rutherford B. Hayes (right).\n\nBy Foley\u2019s measure, the presidential election of 1876 was anything but a \u201csuccess story.\u201d Not only was it one of the closest presidential contests in American history, but it was also riddled with anti-democratic shenanigans including voter intimidation and ballot tampering.\n\nThe candidates in 1876 were Republican Rutherford B. Hayes and Democrat Samuel Tilden. But more important than the candidates themselves were the issues at stake. This election took place a decade after the Civil War. One of the goals of Reconstruction in the South was to safeguard voting rights for Black Americans as enshrined in the 15th Amendment, but those efforts met violent resistance from groups like the Redemption movement.\n\n\u201cThat movement engaged in what can only be called terrorism tactics against Black voting,\u201d says Foley.\n\nReconstruction was effectively dead by the 1876 election, and suppression of the Black vote was rampant, resulting in Democratic victories across the South. Hayes and the Republicans cried foul and demanded recounts in South Carolina, Louisiana and Florida. But instead of fighting fair, the Republicans resorted to their own dirty tricks.\n\n\u201cFlorida was the most egregious,\u201d says Foley. \u201cRepublicans there used their lingering power over the recount process to manipulate the counting of the ballots,\u201d says Foley. \u201cHad there been an honest recount in Florida, it would have favored the Democrats, but Hayes was declared the winner.\"\n\nThings got even messier from there. The Democratic attorney general of Florida came up with his own recount declaring Tilden the state\u2019s winner. Since the Constitution doesn\u2019t say what to do when electoral votes are contested, Congress had to come up with a solution. In this case it was a bipartisan group of 14 congressmen and one Supreme Court justice known as the Electoral Commission.\n\nUltimately, this 15-person commission decided the 1876 election, giving the presidency to Hayes and the Republicans by one vote.\n\nNote only did the commission\u2019s decision come down to one vote, but so did the tally in the electoral college. By winning all three of the contested states, Hayes defeated Tilden by 185 electoral votes to 184, the smallest electoral margin of victory in American history.\n\n5. 2000: Supreme Court Weighs In\n\nHow the U.S. Supreme Court Decided the Presidential Election of 2000\n\n\u201cThe 2000 election is the classic when it comes to close presidential elections,\u201d says Foley.\n\nThat contest, which dragged on for 36 days of intense legal wrangling, excruciating ballot recounts and a historic Supreme Court decision, was ultimately decided by just 537 votes.\n\nThe candidates in 2000 were Democrat Al Gore, the vice president, and Republican George W. Bush, governor of Texas and son of former president George H.W. Bush. The race was neck and neck, and once again Florida was the swing state. Whoever captured Florida\u2019s 25 electoral votes would win the presidency.\n\nExit polls on election night showed Bush with a commanding lead in Florida. After midnight, Bush\u2019s victory seemed so assured that Gore called the Texas governor to congratulate him. But just 45 minutes later, as Gore prepared to give his concession speech, aides told him that Bush\u2019s lead in Florida was shrinking fast. In an unprecedented move, Gore called Bush a second time to rescind his concession.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a term that recount lawyers use\u2014are the election results within the \u2018margin of litigation?\u2019\u201d says Foley. \u201cGore\u2019s lawyers determined that Bush\u2019s lead in Florida was definitely within the margin of litigation. It was worth fighting over.\u201d\n\nFirst the courts ordered an electronic recount, but Gore\u2019s team asked for a hand recount of paper ballots in certain voting precincts. The slow, painstaking process introduced Americans to the term \u201changing chad,\u201d referring to a punch-style ballot where the hole isn\u2019t fully perforated.\n\nRobert King/Newsmakers/Getty Images Contested ballots from Florida are studied following the 2000 election.\n\nThe legal fight went all the way to the Supreme Court, which handed down two rulings: 1.) the Florida recount, as it was being handled, was unconstitutional, and 2.) it was too late for Gore\u2019s team to issue further challenges. In a 5-4 decision, the justices gave the victory to Bush.\n\n\u201cFour of the justices wanted to remand the case back to Florida to clean up the recount procedure,\u201d says Foley, \u201cBut the other five justices said the clock\u2019s run out\u2014it\u2019s over.\u201d\n\nAt last count, Bush received 2,912,790 votes in Florida and Gore got 2,912,253 votes. Out of the nearly 6 million votes cast in Florida, Bush won by a margin of 537 votes, or 0.009 percent of the total votes cast in Florida.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the narrowest margin of victory in terms of percentage,\u201d says Foley. \u201cI can't think of any other presidential election that ends like that.\u201d",

Jim Jordan, the Republican chair of the House Judiciary Committee, Zuckerberg alleges that the officials, including those from the White House, \u201crepeatedly pressured\u201d Facebook for months to take down \u201ccertain COVID-19 content including humor and satire.\u201d\n\nThe officials \u201cexpressed a lot of frustration\u201d when the company didn\u2019t agree, he said in the letter.\n\n\u201cI believe the government pressure was wrong and I regret that we were not more outspoken about it,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote in the letter dated Aug. 26 and posted on the committee\u2019s Facebook page and to its account on X.\n\nThe letter is the latest repudiation by Zuckerberg of efforts to target misinformation around the coronavirus pandemic during and after the 2020 presidential election, particularly as allegations have emerged that some posts were deleted or restricted wrongly.\n\n\u201cI also think we made some choices that, with the benefit of hindsight and new information, we wouldn\u2019t make today,\u201d he said, without elaborating. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to push back if something like this happens again.\u201d\n\nIn response, the White House said in a statement that, \u201cWhen confronted with a deadly pandemic, this Administration encouraged responsible actions to protect public health and safety. Our position has been clear and consistent: we believe tech companies and other private actors should take into account the effects their actions have on the American people, while making independent choices about the information they present.\u201d\n\nExperts warn this year\u2019s U.S. election could be swamped by misinformation on social media with the proliferation of artificial intelligence and other tools to produce false news stories and content that could mislead voters.\n\nFacebook in early 2021 appended what Zuckerberg called labels with \u201ccredible information\u201d to posts about COVID-19 vaccines. That\u2019s after it moved in April 2020 \u2014 just as the virus had led to global shutdowns and radical changes in everyday life \u2014 to warn users who shared misinformation about COVID-19.\n\nConservatives have long derided Facebook and other major tech companies as favoring liberal priorities and accused them of censorship.\n\nZuckerberg has tried to change the company\u2019s perception on the right, going on podcaster Joe Rogan\u2019s show in 2022 and complimenting Republican nominee Donald Trump\u2019s response to an assassination attempt as \u201cbadass.\u201d He sent Monday\u2019s letter to the House Judiciary Committee, whose chairman, Jordan, is a longtime Trump ally.\n\nZuckerberg also said he would no longer donate money to widen election access for voters through the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the company that runs the philanthropy for him and his wife, Priscilla Chan.\n\nThe couple previously donated $400 million to help local election offices prepare for voters in the 2020 presidential election, with funds used for protective equipment to prevent the spread of the coronavirus at polling sites, drive-thru voting locations and equipment to process mail ballots.\n\n\u201cI know that some people believe this work benefited one party over the other\u201d despite analyses showing otherwise, he said. \u201cMy goal is to be neutral and not play a role one way or another \u2013 or to even appear to be playing a role. So I don\u2019t plan on making a similar contribution this cycle.\u201d",

The source said Arlington officials had made clear that only cemetery staff members would be authorized to take photographs or film in the area, known as Section 60.\n\nWhen the cemetery official tried to prevent Trump campaign staff from entering Section 60, campaign staff verbally abused and pushed the official aside, according to the source.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nTrump participated in an event to mark the third anniversary of a deadly attack on U.S. troops in Afghanistan as U.S. forces withdrew from the country; 13 U.S. service members were killed in the attack. The Trump campaign has blamed President Biden and Vice President Harris, now the Democratic presidential nominee, for the chaotic withdrawal.\n\nIn a statement to NPR, Steven Cheung, the Trump campaign's spokesman, strongly rejected the notion of a physical altercation, adding: \"We are prepared to release footage if such defamatory claims are made.\n\n\"The fact is that a private photographer was permitted on the premises and for whatever reason an unnamed individual, clearly suffering from a mental health episode, decided to physically block members of President Trump's team during a very solemn ceremony,\" Cheung said in the statement.\n\nThe Trump campaign declined to make that footage immediately available. On Wednesday the campaign released a video on TikTok that includes Trump's Section 60 visit.\n\nLate Tuesday night, President Trump posted a photo on social media of the Gold Star families who had invited him. In the post, the families thanked the president and said they had invited the campaign to film in Section 60. But filming there would still contravene federal law, \"which prohibits political campaign or election-related activities within the cemeteries.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAt a campaign event Wednesday, Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance dismissed the story, saying, \u201cThe altercation at Arlington Cemetery is the media creating a story where I really don\u2019t think that there is one.\u201d Vance went on to add that, \u201cApparently somebody at Arlington cemetery, some staff member, had a little disagreement with somebody, and they have turned, the media has turned this, into a national news story.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to NPR on Tuesday, Arlington National Cemetery said it \"can confirm there was an incident, and a report was filed.\"\n\n\"Federal law prohibits political campaign or election-related activities within Army National Military Cemeteries, to include photographers, content creators or any other persons attending for purposes, or in direct support of a partisan political candidate's campaign,\" according to the statement. \"Arlington National Cemetery reinforced and widely shared this law and its prohibitions with all participants.\"\n\nArlington officials updated the statement on Wednesday, writing, \u201cTo protect the identity of the individual involved, no further information about the incident is being released at this time.\u201d",

        "text": "Trump-approved Georgia election officials' new rules could spur 'doubt and suspicion'\nIn the final months before the 2024 presidential election, three Republicans on the Georgia State Election Board are making new election rules that elected officials and experts in both major parties warn could sow misinformation and chaos in November. Some critics even worry the rule changes could be used to alter election results outright \u2212 and the board may yet make even more changes before the election.\n\n\"They are a mess,\" Georgia Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger told USA TODAY of the board's efforts to change vote certification requirements so close to Election Day.\n\nOne of the latest rules, which passed Aug. 19, requires county investigations of even minor discrepancies between the number of ballots cast and the number of voters in a precinct before certifying the results. Critics worry that could cause delays or even failures to certify.\n\n\"Any effort to delay also is an opportunity to infuse doubt and suspicion and accusations, and we saw that happen in 2020,\" Kathy Boockvar, a Democrat who served as Pennsylvania's Secretary of the Commonwealth from Jan. 2019 to Feb. 2021, told USA TODAY.\n\nThe board passed that rule just four days after Raffensperger \u2013 who famously resisted Donald Trump's request to \"find\" nearly 12,000 votes to reverse Joe Biden's 2020 Georgia victory \u2212 issued a press release denouncing its ongoing activity so close to November. \u201cActivists seeking to impose last-minute changes in election procedures outside of the legislative process undermine voter confidence and burden election workers,\u201d Raffensperger stated.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nThe board's actions prompted a Monday lawsuit by Democrats and Georgia county election officials, who want a court to make clear ahead of the election that state deadlines for certifying the results are mandatory, and the new rules don't change that fact.\n\nThe board is also set to consider a requirement next month for local officials to hand-count every ballot before certifying results.\n\nThe three members on the five-person board, Dr. Janice Johnston, Rick Jaffares, and Janelle King, became a majority voting bloc in May when King replaced another Republican board member who resisted some efforts to sow doubt about Joe Biden's 2020 victory in Georgia.\n\nSince then, the trio has been praised by Republican presidential nominee Trump as \"pit bulls\" fighting for \"victory,\" while passing a series of rules that change Georgia's vote-counting process in the final months before the November election, including a requirement passed on Aug. 6 for counties to conduct a \"reasonable inquiry\" before certifying results.\n\nWhat's true? What's false? Sign up for USA TODAY's Checking the Facts newsletter.\n\nBoard member offended by 'baseless accusations'\n\nThe new rules don't license local election officials to push certification past Georgia's legal deadline \u2013 six days after Election Day. The Aug. 19 rule, for example, states that results \"shall\" be certified by that time.\n\nBoard member Janelle King emphasized that point in a statement to USA TODAY and said the board has taken steps to strengthen the certification process.\n\n\"My mission is not to alter the outcomes of past elections but to ensure that every vote is counted accurately and every election is conducted correctly going forward,\" King said. \"I take offense at the baseless accusations, the intimidation of those who appointed us, and the outright lies that continue to mislead the public in hopes of garnering votes.\"\n\nBoard members Johnston and Jeffares didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\n'Like changing the rules in the last game of the World Series'\n\nThe Monday lawsuit acknowledged the new rules could be read as consistent with the certification deadline, but said they could still cause delays by giving the green light to officials hunting for any election irregularity. Former and current election officials voiced similar concerns to USA TODAY.\n\n\"It's really like changing the rules in the last game of the World Series,\" Kim Wyman, a Republican who served as Washington's secretary of state from 2013 to 2021, told USA TODAY.\n\n\"You shouldn't make changes to election laws or rules or procedures less than 90 days before an election because it doesn't give election officials time to really prepare,\" Wyman said.\n\nThe Georgia Association of Voter Registration and Election Officials \u2013 a group of more than 500 Georgia election officials and staff \u2013 released a statement on Aug. 21 \"urging\" the board to stop passing new rules while training and preparation for the upcoming election is already underway.\n\n\"In a time when maintaining public confidence in elections is more important than ever, making changes so close to Election Day only serves to heighten concerns and fears among voters,\" the association said.\n\nFears of delay, chaos\n\nThe Aug. 6 rule, which requires county officials to engage in a \"reasonable inquiry\" before certifying results, doesn't define what a \"reasonable inquiry\" is.\n\nThat lack of definition is risky, according to Wyman, because election officials are left without clear guidance on how to follow the rule, and the ambiguity could be weaponized by those unhappy with the actual results.\n\n\"When you write a rule that is so ill-defined, you are opening that up for either side to be able to leverage and call into question an election, and that is going to slow the process, and ultimately may result in the election not being certified in time,\" Wyman said.\n\nThe Aug. 19 rule not only mandates investigations of discrepancies between ballots and voters but also allows any individual county election board member to examine \"all election-related documentation\" before certifying results. Critics worry that could enable unmanageable demands.\n\nThe proposed rule that could be approved next month would require independent hand-counting of every physical ballot, in addition to the monitored machine counting that is already in place. Local officials would need to confirm the two numbers match before certifying the results.\n\nKathleen Hamill, a lawyer on an American Bar Association Georgia democracy task force, expressed concern at an Aug. 19 board meeting that hand-counting adds another level of work and creates potential security issues for ballots.\n\nWyman suggested that election officials could easily make errors in a hand count, especially after working a 12-to-16-hour Election Day.\n\n\"Having lived through, as a county auditor, the closest governor's race in the country's history, and a statewide recount that we did twice \u2013 and one was a machine with a hand recount \u2013 I can tell you that people are very bad at repetitive tasks that are mundane,\" she said. \"That's why we've automated a lot of things in modern life, and counting ballots is a good example of that.\"\n\nIn a May election board meeting before Janelle King became a member, a lawyer for Raffensperger's office said \"hand counts are notoriously less accurate than machine counts.\"\n\nOne of the three Trump-approved board members, Johnston, appeared poised to approve the hand-counting rule at a meeting last week. King, however, who is another of the three, proposed an amendment to the rule to give local workers beyond Election Day to complete the hand count. That meant a vote on the rule had to be pushed to a later board meeting.\n\nWhy critics say rules could assist election theft\n\nProponents of the rules say they are meant to ensure election result accuracy and boost public confidence in the system. Former Virginia Attorney General and Trump administration official Ken Cuccinelli, for example, spoke at the election board's Aug. 19 meeting in defense of the rule on investigating discrepancies between the number of voters and cast ballots.\n\n\"If more ballots show up than voters, good grief, I would think anybody would want to flag and solve that problem as soon as possible,\" he said.\n\nSome critics worry certification delays could spur not just chaos and misinformation, but also outright failures to certify, which could then alter the election's outcome.\n\nThat's because if Georgia failed to certify, for example, Vice President Kamala Harris winning the key swing state, it would cost her the state's 16 Electoral College votes. Or if an individual Georgia county failed to certify, the state might certify its statewide results without including the votes of that county, which could change who gets the 16 college votes.\n\n\u201cWhat folks need to understand when we\u2019re talking about not certifying is \u2212 that\u2019s not an academic exercise,\u201d said Hannah Fried, the executive director of All Voting Is Local, a nonpartisan voter rights group. \u201cThat is your vote not being counted.\u201d\n\nIn a New York Times op-ed, MSNBC host Rachel Maddow argued that refusals to certify results in the upcoming election will more likely be part of \"a bad-faith strategy to mess with the democratic process\" than an indication of real electoral problems. She noted the increasingly common Republican tendency since 2020 to refuse to certify election results.\n\nAt least 19 election board members across nine Georgia counties objected to certifying elections in the past four years, according to a statewide survey by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nWho is behind the rules?\n\nAt least one aide in Trump's efforts to reverse the results of the 2020 election has been involved in the recent rule changes, according to ProPublica. It reported that Cleta Mitchell, a lawyer who was on the call with Trump when he proposed that Raffensperger find him nearly 12,000 votes to reverse Biden's victory in the state, was behind an initial draft of the Aug. 19 rule on investigating discrepancies between ballot and voter totals.\n\nMitchell told USA TODAY in an email there \"is not ONE shred of evidence that the rules will \u2018delay\u2019 certification.\"\n\nShe noted that the new rules don't change the deadlines under Georgia law for certifying results, and said they create a procedure for implementing existing requirements under state law.\n\nFears that the changes will delay certification, create chaos, or be leveraged to undermine election results \"bear no resemblance to reality,\" she said.\n\nGeorgia Republican Party Chair Josh McKoon also emailed the text of two other proposed rules to one of the board members in July, according to a lawsuit from nonprofit government watchdog American Oversight. The three board members initially passed versions of the rules at a meeting that the state attorney general's office warned would likely be unlawful, American Oversight alleged. King told USA TODAY the meeting was lawful, but \"in the spirit of board unity,\" the three Trump-approved members agreed to withdraw the rules and revisit them later.\n\nThe Georgia Republican Party didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\n\"This is coming from national extremist activists who, by and large, have spent the last four years trying to overturn the prior election by promoting false information,\" said Boockvar, the Democrat who served as Pennsylvania's Secretary of the Commonwealth from Jan. 2019 to Feb. 2021.\n\nThe Trump-approved board members also voted on Aug. 7 to reinvestigate the 2020 election, despite a caution by the governor-appointed board chairman that they may be breaking the law. Multiple counts in Georgia confirmed Biden won the state.\n\nTrump posted a video of the Aug. 7 vote on his Truth Social media platform with an approving message, stating that officials \"MUST get moving on this\" and \"WE MUST WIN GEORGIA IN 2024!!!\"\n\nIn a Monday statement, Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp said he is seeking guidance from the state attorney general on whether and how he is authorized to act on ethics complaints that Georgia Democrats have brought against the election board.\n\nFears for November election\n\nA core point former and current election officials turned back to is that last-minute rule changes are breeding grounds for delay and uncertainty in the aftermath of voting, and ultimately for mistrust.\n\n\"The public confidence in our election system is really what's at stake in this upcoming election,\" former Washington Secretary of State Kim Wyman said.\n\nRaffensperger said in a press release that Georgia law already has protocols to handle ballots and ensure they remain secure.\n\nAn effort \"to change these laws by unelected bureaucrats on the eve of the election introduces the opportunity for error, lost or stolen ballots, and fraud,\" he said.\n\nContributing: Erin Mansfield",
