        "text": "How Latino voters view the 2024 presidential election\n(Jeff Greenberg/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)\n\nFrom 2016 to 2024, the number of Latinos eligible to vote grew from 27 million to a projected 36 million.\n\nWhile Latino voters have favored Democratic candidates in presidential elections for many decades, the margin of support has varied. In 2020, 61% of Latino voters cast their ballot for Joe Biden, while 36% voted for Donald Trump, a narrower margin than in 2016 between Hillary Clinton and Trump.\n\nHow we did this Pew Research Center conducted this analysis to understand U.S. Hispanics\u2019 views of the 2024 presidential election campaign. For this analysis, we surveyed 9,424 adults \u2013 including 670 Hispanic registered voters \u2013 from July 1 to 7, 2024. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), a group of people recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses who have agreed to take surveys regularly. This kind of recruitment gives nearly all U.S. adults a chance of selection. Surveys were conducted either online or by telephone with a live interviewer. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other factors. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology. Here are the questions used for this analysis, the topline and the survey methodology.\n\nHere are key facts about how Latino registered voters view the presidential candidates and major issues ahead of the 2024 election, based on a Pew Research Center survey. The July 1-7 survey was conducted after President Biden\u2019s poor performance in the June 27 debate and before Trump was injured and a spectator killed in a shooting at a campaign rally on July 13.\n\nEqual shares of Latino registered voters say they would vote for Biden and Trump in the 2024 election. Roughly a third of Latino voters (36%) say they would vote for or lean toward each of the candidates if the election were held today.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2013 a third-party candidate \u2013 gets the support of 24% of Latino registered voters. Support for Kennedy is higher among Latinos than among U.S. voters overall (15%).\n\nRelated: Third-party and independent candidates for president often fall short of early polling numbers\n\nNeither Biden nor Trump has the confidence of most Latino voters on several issues.\n\nThe state of the U.S. economy and inflation have been top issues for Latino voters in 2024.\n\nAbout half of Latino voters (52%) say they have confidence that Trump will make good decisions about economic policy.\n\nBy comparison, four-in-ten say they have confidence in Biden in this area. Trump also has a slim edge over Biden on foreign policy.\n\nMeanwhile, 49% of Latino voters say they have confidence in Biden to select good Supreme Court nominees, compared with 42% who say the same about Trump.\n\nWhen it comes to making good decisions about abortion policy, 50% of Latino voters express confidence in Biden, while 45% have confidence in Trump.\n\nAnd on immigration, 39% have confidence in Biden, while 45% have confidence in Trump.\n\nRelatively few Latino voters would describe Trump as honest and Biden as mentally sharp. Roughly half of Latino voters (55%) say \u201chonest\u201d describes Biden very or fairly well, while 30% say the same about Trump.\n\nAnd just a quarter of Latino voters say they would describe Biden as \u201cmentally sharp,\u201d while nearly twice as many (49%) describe Trump this way.\n\nLatino voters continue to have a more favorable opinion of the Democratic Party than the Republican Party. However, neither party is viewed favorably by a majority of Latino voters (or of the public overall).\n\nSome 44% of Latino registered voters have a very or mostly favorable opinion of the Democratic Party, while 32% say the same about the GOP.\n\nViews of the Democratic Party also vary among Latino voters based on certain demographic characteristics:\n\nWomen are more likely than men to say they have a favorable opinion of the Democratic Party (50% vs. 40%).\n\nLatino voters ages 50 and older are somewhat more likely than their younger counterparts to say they have a favorable view of the Democratic Party (48% vs. 42%).\n\nHalf of Latino registered voters say the Democratic Party cares at least somewhat about people like them. Four-in-ten have the same view of the Republican Party.\n\nSimilarly, when Latinos are asked how hard each party works to earn the vote of people like them, roughly half of Latino voters say the Democratic Party works at least somewhat hard (54%) compared with 47% who say this about the GOP.\n\nNote: Here are the questions used for this analysis, the topline and the survey methodology.",

Here are 5 ways to take care of your mental health\n\ntoggle caption Elijah Nouvelage/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe presidential election is taking a toll on the mental health of Americans. And that's according to recent surveys conducted before the attempt on one candidate's life and widespread calls for another to drop out of the race.\n\nIn a poll by the American Psychiatric Association, nearly three-quarters (73%) of respondents said they're feeling anxious about the election. Another poll by Myriad Genetics found that nearly 40% said they are feeling anxious and/or depressed about the election season, and a similar share said they are \"checked out\" by the amount of news and social media attention on politics and the upcoming election.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nPsychologists say it's normal for people to feel heightened negative emotions during this time.\n\n\"There's a range of emotions that people experience during this time leading up to elections that can go from fear to anger to feeling stressed out to feeling extremely sad and fearful of the future,\" says psychologist Krystal Lewis at the National Institute of Mental Health. \"Those emotions are all valid, and it's OK to feel those emotions.\"\n\nAnd it's important to pay attention to those feelings, especially stress, says psychologist Lynn Bufka, deputy chief of professional practice at the American Psychological Association.\n\n\"It's probably telling us to pay attention to some extent to what's happening in the world so that we can be prepared to act in ways that are consistent with our beliefs and our values,\" she says.\n\nLewis says it's a good idea to channel that stress and anxiety into ways we can make a difference. That might involve getting more information on specific candidates and the policies they support. Here, she emphasizes not to lean on what someone else thinks or says but to rely on \"factual or validated news sources and websites.\"\n\n\"Figure out ways to use your voice,\" she says. \"Use that energy to either volunteer with organizations or share some information with other people, and essentially [exercise] your right to vote.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThat said, it's also important to pay attention to whether these feelings of stress and anxiety are overwhelming or getting in the way of daily life.\n\n\"When the stress becomes intense or long lasting and maybe symptoms develop such as prolonged sadness, worry, hopelessness, physical tensions or signs of anxiety and stress in the body, then that might be a point of intervention,\" says Lewis.\n\nIn other words, if your feelings are very overwhelming and persist for a long time, seek mental health care. And if you are feeling any of those symptoms, it's important to find ways to manage them.\n\nPeople with preexisting anxiety and depression might be more likely to experience these symptoms at a time of societal uncertainty and upheaval, she adds.\n\nFor those looking to get a handle on their stress and anxiety right now, here are some strategies from Lewis and Bufka.\n\n1. The first thing to do is understand what's fueling your symptoms \u2014 it's the uncertainty.\n\n\"Uncertainty is a breeding ground for anxiety and fear,\" says Lewis.\n\n\"We'd like to know what's going to happen,\" adds Bufka. \"We'd like to predict. So when uncertainty strikes, many people start to imagine worst-case scenarios.\" And that's not helpful, she says. \"An important strategy there is to try to break that habit, not go to the what's-the-worst-thing-that's-going-to-happen and anticipate everything will fall apart if X happens or Y happens.\"\n\nInstead, she suggests asking ourselves questions like: \"How likely is that worst-case scenario? Can I manage to cope with that? What are the kinds of things that I might again have some control over to try to manage a situation that would look like that?\"\n\nThose specific questions and one's responses to them can help people get a sense of control. \"Focusing on what we can control is a great way to help us manage our stress and anxiety,\" says Bufka.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n2. Another way to exercise control is to limit how much news one consumes.\n\nKnow when to step away or take a break, suggests Lewis. \"What that might look like is turning off the television, news outlets, wherever you're receiving your news,\" she says.\n\nThat includes social media. \"We don't have to scroll through social media just because it's handy and it's in front of us because we have smartphones in our pockets,\" says Bufka.\n\n3. Do things that are meaningful to you.\n\nThat could involve connecting with other people on issues you care about and working toward a cause, says Bufka. Or it might involve \"making sure that your older parents have a good meal tonight because they don't feel up to cooking themselves,\" she says, \"or picking up the trash in your neighborhood just to make it a better place.\"\n\nResearch shows that engaging in activities that are meaningful improves people's overall well-being, says Bufka, particularly during times of stress.\n\n4. Find other healthy ways to cope.\n\nThat includes doing things that bring you joy and keep you in the present moment, says Lewis, instead of worrying about what may or may not happen in the future.\n\n\"So this might be for individuals who like to be outside, [spend] time in nature, doing fun things with your family, finding joy in your daily activities.\"\n\nAnd don't forget to move your body, notes Bufka. \"We have extra energy in our bodies when we're stressed and overwhelmed, and being active allows us to release that stress,\" she says. \"Whether it's going on a walk, whether it's pulling weeds in the garden, whether it's playing soccer with your friends, playing tag with the kids \u2014 any of those things can help us release some of that physical energy and feel a little more present.\"\n\n5. Stay socially connected.\n\nAs multiple studies have shown, social isolation is bad for our mental and physical health. And it is particularly harmful if our mental health is already feeling frayed. \"Staying socially connected with friends, family, peers that help support us and give us someone to turn to when we're feeling overwhelmed \u2014 that makes a big difference in how we handle our stress,\" notes Bufka.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut, she cautions, \"we do have to be careful to not turn into stress spirals with other people.\"\n\nAnd make sure not to isolate yourself from people who have different political views from you, she adds.\n\n\"We don't have to dive into political conversations with everybody that we meet,\" she says, \"but connecting with people who might actually have different points of view than us [and] seeing our shared humanity can help us to lower the temperature about what our feared outcomes are.\"",

(Andres Kudacki/Getty Images)\n\nWe\u2019re pleased to introduce Deep Dive, a new article series on hias.org that explores, in detail, a specific issue relevant to HIAS\u2019 work. In this first edition, we lay out five key facts about one of the most important issues informing the upcoming U.S. presidential election: immigration, refugees, and asylum. Few issues loom larger for the upcoming presidential election in the United States than immigration. During the Republican National Convention, a parade of speakers spoke about undocumented immigrants, asylum seekers, and refugees in near-apocalyptic terms. Democrats, too, have touted their \u201ctoughness\u201d on immigration, while the Biden administration has enacted historically stringent measures to curb asylum. This change reflects a public souring toward immigration: Gallup recently reported that 55% of Americans want immigration levels reduced \u2014 the highest figure since 2001. Since our founding more than a century ago, HIAS has provided essential services to refugees, asylum seekers, and other displaced and stateless people around the world. In order to frame the U.S. immigration debate in truth \u2014 rather than misinformation, propaganda, and innuendo \u2014 below are five relevant facts you should know. Fact One: Seeking Asylum is Legal. The United States government defines asylum as a form of protection granted to foreign nationals or stateless individuals who face, or are at risk of facing, persecution on account of their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or association with a particular political opinion. Asylum rights became enshrined into international law following the Second World War and were codified in U.S. law in 1980. People have a right to claim asylum in the U.S. regardless of how they entered the country. In the past decade, asylum rights have come under sustained threat. But it remains legal in the United States \u2014 and a crucial right to protect.\n\nRelated News Asylum Backlog Presents Anguish, Uncertainty for Seekers\n\nFact Two: Asylum Is Not Easy to Obtain. Immigration opponents have portrayed the United States asylum system as a free-for-all, where every individual who approaches the border claims asylum and then enters the country freely. In fact, the asylum process is complex, tricky, and, for many applicants, one that does not result in acceptance. Asylum claims filed in immigration court face steep odds, especially for claimants \u2014 some 70% of the total number \u2014 who do not have legal representation. But even those who do obtain the services of an attorney enter a system with a daunting backlog. Moreover, there has been an onslaught of recent changes at the U.S.-Mexico border that prevent people from accessing the asylum system in the first place. Recent policies require people to wait in Mexico while trying to access appointments via a cellphone app, deny due process in initial screening interviews, speed up deportations at the border, increase the usage of immigration detention, and simply deny entry to asylum seekers altogether. All these factors contribute to the approval rate for asylum seekers remaining low. In 2021, only 37% of asylum applications were granted.\n\nAsylum claims filed in immigration court face steep odds, especially for claimants \u2014 some 70% of the total number \u2014 who do not have legal representation.\n\nFact Three: Asylum Seekers and Refugees Help the Economy. A common claim made by anti-immigrant politicians is that asylum seekers and refugees are a drain on the economy, namely by competing with native-born Americans for jobs and driving wages down. In fact, the opposite is true: A recent study from the Department of Health and Human Services found that between 2005 and 2019, asylees and refugees contributed a net $124 billion to the U.S. economy \u2013 more than the GDP of the Dominican Republic. Refugees and asylum seekers are almost 50% more likely than the general U.S. population to become entrepreneurs, despite facing obstacles \u2014 like easy access to credit \u2014 that American-born entrepreneurs take for granted. Earlier this year, HIAS launched the Economic Advancement Fund (EAF), a Community Development Financial Institution designed to provide resources to refugee entrepreneurs in the U.S. Fact Four: Asylum Seekers and Immigrants Commit Fewer Crimes, Per Capita, Than Average. One of the most consistent lines of rhetoric from anti-immigrant politicians is that refugee and asylum seekers are directly responsible for an increase in crime. At the Republican National Convention, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) said that \u201cevery day Americans are dying \u2014 murdered, assaulted, raped by illegal immigrants that the Democrats have released.\u201d The facts do not back up this insinuation. A 2020 study found that in Cruz\u2019 own Texas, a state that records the immigration status of everyone who is arrested, undocumented immigrants are significantly less likely to commit crimes.\n\nA 2020 study found that Texas, undocumented immigrants are significantly less likely to commit crimes.\n\nFact Five: Our Asylum System Is Broken. But That Doesn\u2019t Mean It Can\u2019t Be Fixed. Immigration opponents often argue that measures to prevent people from entering, and to curtail access to asylum \u2014 such as construction of a border wall, or Title 42-style suspensions \u2014 are the only solution for tackling the rise of encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border. This is a false choice. People who are fleeing danger will not stop trying to save the lives of themselves and their families. Draconian policies do not stop people from coming \u2014 they only increase a volatile and chaotic environment that denies the rights of asylum seekers and does nothing to provide security at the border. Real solutions are possible, but there must be political will to achieve them. The present situation along the border occurred due to multiple factors, not least that Congress has failed to pass significant immigration reform since 1996. More resources are also needed on the local level. In cities across the U.S., HIAS has seen an outpouring of welcome for newcomers seeking safety \u2014 but these communities can\u2019t do it alone. The federal government has failed to allocate sufficient resources to support cities as they work to meet the needs of asylum seekers.\n\nRelated News Hetfield Calls for Immigration Reform at U.S. House Hearing",

        "text": "Editorial on the Republican National Convention: Trump season\nAs the Republican National Convention drew to a close in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, it became obvious that the Party\u2019s expected nominee for the 2024 U.S. presidential election in November, former President Donald Trump, is not only capitalising on the popularity boost that he has inevitably benefited from since surviving an assassination attempt a week earlier, but has now established total control of the Republican Party and is in a strong position to take on incumbent President Joe Biden in that regard. The Convention itself marked several firsts \u2014 not only was Mr. Trump\u2019s speech the first major public remarks he delivered since the assassin\u2019s bullet injured his ear but otherwise left him unscathed, but the Convention itself was held for the first time in person since the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the cancellation of all public political events in 2020. It would also appear that Republican strategists have deepened their appreciation of optics as far as Mr. Trump\u2019s appeal among the electorate goes. There was a distinct attempt to project the political power of women at the event, almost as if to soften the former president\u2019s image, which was in years past battered by revelations of his unflattering remarks about women. Mr. Trump\u2019s wife Melania made a rare appearance at the event, as did his 17-year-old granddaughter Kai, his daughter-in-law and co-chair of the Republican National Committee, Lara, Arkansas Governor Sarah Sanders, Mr. Trump\u2019s former Press Secretary, and Indian American Usha Chilukuri Vance, who is the wife of Mr. Trump\u2019s running mate, J.D. Vance.\n\nThere is much to analyse in Mr. Trump picking the 39-year-old Mr. Vance for Vice Presidential candidate in the upcoming race. Mr. Trump is evidently keen to win over younger demographic cohorts in this election; he is also aligned to white, male America, and what it stands for in the country\u2019s fraught politics today. There is also a geographic message in the subtext \u2014 as the junior Senator from Ohio, Mr. Vance could also become a critical interlocutor for the Trump campaign\u2019s engagement with the all-important Rust Belt states \u2014 swing states of the mid-western U.S. that can potentially make or break a presidential candidate. While there is no denying Mr. Trump\u2019s overall strong position and lead in swing states according to several national polls, three months is a long time in politics, and that certainly applies to the U.S.",

        "text": "How Biden\u2019s re-election campaign fell apart \u2013 a timeline of three tumultuous weeks\nThey may go down as the wildest three weeks in the history of the US presidency, when the prospects of Joe Biden\u2019s candidacy surviving until polling day seemed to change from day to day \u2013 sometimes even from hour to hour.\n\nHere\u2019s a summary of the milestone events in an rollercoaster period in US politics. It began with a political debate on national TV that triggered a Democratic rebellion, took in a shocking assassination attempt on Donald Trump and ended with Biden withdrawing his 2024 candidacy and endorsing his deputy Kamala Harris.\n\n27 June\n\nBiden and Donald Trump face off in the earliest debate ever staged between two main candidates in a presidential election, largely in response to demands by a White House team eager to allay doubts over the president\u2019s advanced age (81) and suspicions that his cognitive powers are fading. Instead, Biden puts in a perplexing performance that intensifies the concerns. Over 90 minutes, he appears at times confused, mangles his sentences, repeatedly loses his train of thought and fails to combat a rush of lies from a bullishly confident Trump, who cannot conceal his glee over his rival\u2019s discomfiture. Democratic operatives exchange frantic messages calling for Biden to abandon his campaign even while the debate unfolds.\n\n28 June\n\nThe president, realising his campaign is suddenly in deep trouble, tries to launch a counteroffensive, telling a rally of supporters in North Carolina that he is staying in the race. \u201cI know I\u2019m not a young man,\u201d he shouts \u2013 reading his remarks from a teleprompter. \u201cI don\u2019t debate as well as I used to, but I know what I do know \u2026 When you get knocked down, you get back up!\u201d\n\nFew are convinced. Within hours, the New York Times, the most influential newspaper in the US, publishes a searing editorial telling Biden to step aside, calling his candidacy a \u201creckless gamble\u201d that risks a second Trump presidency.\n\n2:11 Why Joe Biden has dropped out of the presidential race - video explainer\n\n3 July\n\nAs pressure mounts and with a Democratic member of Congress, Lloyd Doggett of Texas, already having called for him to withdraw, Biden meets virtually with state governors in an effort to set minds at rest. But although he wins statements of support, doubts persist after it is reported that he tells them that he is trying to refrain from holding events after 8pm to conserve energy. There is unease at his response when one governor, Josh Green of Hawaii \u2013 a medical doctor \u2013 inquires about his health, eliciting the puzzling response: \u201cIt\u2019s just my brain.\u201d\n\n5 July\n\nBiden gives his first mainstream interview since the debate, an eagerly awaited 22-minute affair with George Stephanopoulos of ABC in a school library in Wisconsin. It is an improvement on the disastrous debate showing but hardly reassuring. The president declares that only the \u201cLord almighty\u201d could persuade him to step aside from the race. Many Democrats also express deep misgiving about his response to being asked how he would feel if he ran against Trump in November only to lose. \u201cI\u2019ll feel as long as I gave it my all and I did as good a job as I know I can do \u2013 that\u2019s what this is about,\u201d he replies. Some condemn the statement as out of touch, given the Democratic fears of a second Trump presidency.\n\n7 July\n\nHakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, holds crisis talks with senior party House members, at least four of whom say the president should step aside as candidate.\n\n8 July\n\nBiden strikes back in anger. As members of Congress return to Washington DC after a recess, the president sends a letter to the entire Democratic congressional contingent telling them he is unequivocally committed to staying in the race and reaffirming his belief that he can beat Trump. He follows up with an unscheduled live telephone interview to MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe programme in which he throws down the gauntlet to his critics by telling them to \u201cchallenge me at the [Democratic] convention\u201d, due to take place in Chicago in August. Jeffries meets with a full complement of House Democrats on Capitol Hill, some of whom tearfully voice fears about the effect Biden\u2019s plunging popularity in the polls might have on their own election prospects. Yet many Democrats appear resigned to Biden staying on the ticket.\n\n10 July\n\nWith the mutiny apparently fizzling out, the New York Times gives it renewed impetus by publishing an opinion article from George Clooney, one of the Democrats\u2019 biggest fundraisers, urging Biden to stand down. Proclaiming his love and admiration for the president, Clooney cites his personal experience of a fundraising event in Hollywood last month attended by Biden, who he says cut the same disturbingly diminished figure that millions saw on the debate stage in Atlanta on 27 June.\n\n11 July\n\nWith the pressure on and mounting numbers of Democrats calling for his withdrawal, Biden holds a rare news conference marking the close of Nato\u2019s 75th anniversary conference in Washington DC. Facing massed ranks of international journalists and speaking for an hour without the aid of a teleprompter, the president gives an admirable \u2013 yet still flawed \u2013 performance. He expounds on intricate details of foreign and economic policy. At the same time, he commits embarrassing gaffes, referring to his vice-president, Kamala Harris, as \u201cVice-President Trump\u201d without correcting himself, having earlier mistakenly introduced the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, as \u201cPresident Putin\u201d. The performance seems enough to buy him time.\n\n0:59 Joe Biden mistakenly refers to Zelenskiy as Putin before correcting himself \u2013 video\n\n13 July\n\nDonald Trump survives an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Butler county, Pennsylvania, a stunning development that puts the discussions on Biden\u2019s candidacy on hold just as the president has been holding talks on his future with leading party figures, including Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate majority leader.\n\n14 July\n\nBiden\u2019s staff temporarily suspends all campaign events and political advertising in a display of solidarity over the attempt on Trump\u2019s life. The president gives a prime-time televised speech from the White House urging that both parties rhetorically \u201clower the temperature\u201d to stave off a rise in political violence.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The plan triggers an immediate backlash among Democrats who still believe Biden must step aside.\n\nMeanwhile, Biden gives an arresting answer to NBC\u2019s Lester Holt in another prime-time interview when asked who he listens to on whether he should remain or drop out of the race. \u201cMe,\u201d he replies. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this a long time.\u201d\n\n17 July\n\nWhile campaigning in Nevada, the president tests positive for Covid and immediately returns to his home in Delaware to isolate. The announcement seems to mark an end to the brief respite in the efforts to persuade him to end his candidacy. The DNC, reportedly following an intervention by Schumer, announces it is postponing the planned electronic roll call by at least a week \u2013 giving Biden\u2019s critics more time to muster.\n\nOn the same day, senior Democrats including Adam Schiff, the Democratic candidate for US Senate in California, the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, and the House majority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, privately confront Biden about continuing his re-election bid.\n\n18 July\n\nWith Trump preparing to accept the Republican nomination in at the GOP convention in Milwaukee, reports emerge that Biden is at least listening to arguments that he should withdraw and asking if Harris would fare better. It is also reported that Barack Obama has told associates that he believes the president\u2019s path to winning the election has greatly diminished and that he should reconsider the viability of his campaign.\n\n19 July\n\nTen congressional Democrats \u2013 nine House members and one senator \u2013 call for Biden to stand aside as the candidate, bringing the total who have done so publicly to 32. The president insist he will continue as the nominee and is ready to resume campaigning after isolating from Covid, seemingly confounding speculation that he could be preparing a withdrawal announcement.\n\nBiden reiterates that he will stay in the race. The Biden campaign chair, Jen O\u2019Malley, says Biden is \u201cabsolutely\u201d in the race. \u201cJoe Biden is more committed than ever to beat Donald Trump,\u201d she says.\n\n3:53 Joe Biden: a look back at his 50-year political career \u2013 video\n\n21 July\n\nBiden announces that he will not seek re-election, and endorsed his vice-president, Kamala Harris, aiming to avoid further party chaos. Earlier on Sunday, Biden lost the support of the West Virginia senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat turned independent, who urged Biden to drop out but called for an \u201copen process\u201d to select a successor.\n\n\u201cWhile it has been my intention to seek re-election, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and focus solely on fulfilling my duties as president for the remainder of my term,\u201d Biden says in a letter announcing his decision.\n\nDemocrats will hold their convention in Chicago in August, in what was expected to be a Biden coronation but which will now free 4,700 delegates to select a candidate. They are not obliged to select Harris. Ohers potentially waiting in the wings include the California governor Gavin Newsom, Governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania.\n\nDonald Trump responded to Biden\u2019s announcement, saying his ex-rival was not fit to run for president and \u201cnot fit to serve\u201d, Trump added: \u201cWe will suffer greatly because of his presidency, but we will remedy the damage he has done very quickly.\u201d\n\nRead more about Joe Biden dropping out of the 2024 election:",

        "text": "Democratic mood darkens as Joe Biden faces new pressure\nDemocratic mood darkens as Biden faces new pressure\n\nParty elders have reportedly privately said they do not believe Biden can win\n\nBut Mr Biden's campaign batted away reports of high-level Democratic concern as \"baseless\", insisting he would remain the nominee.\n\nPolling on Thursday by the BBC's US partner, CBS News, showed him five points behind Trump - the widest margin recorded this campaign.\n\nSome Democrats painted a bleak picture. One senior party official told the BBC that many in the party felt Mr Biden's stepping down was \"inevitable\".\n\nJoe Biden's campaign faced further pressure on Thursday amid reported concerns from Barack Obama about the presidential election, a darkening mood among Democrats and polls suggesting Donald Trump was pulling ahead.\n\nCan Biden be replaced as nominee? Not so easily\n\nMr Obama was reported by the Washington Post to have privately stated Mr Biden's chances were greatly diminished. Spokespeople for the former president have declined to comment.\n\nThe most recent lawmaker to pull support from Biden's run is Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown. On Friday, the Democrat released a statement saying it is his ''job to keep fighting'' for his constituents.\n\n\u201cI agree with the many Ohioans who have reached out to me. At this critical time, our full attention must return to these important issues. I think the President should end his campaign,\" he said.\n\nIt followed several reports that former house speaker Nancy Pelosi and the two most senior Democrats in Congress, Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer, had advised Mr Biden to consider his candidacy for the good of the party. All have rejected the reports.\n\nBut a senior Democrat source told BBC News that the mood in Washington was grim, adding: \"We are all waiting for the inevitable decision.\"\n\nAdam Smith, a Democratic congressman for Washington state, painted a similarly grim picture. Asked by BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight whether the party was \"coming to the end\" of Mr Biden's candidacy, he said: \"That is my sense\".\n\n\"I mean, I don\u2019t know. But without question, I think that is the direction that this is heading right now.\"\n\nMr Biden has faced a torrid few weeks since his poor showing in the first presidential debate late last month. He is currently in isolation in Delaware while he recovers from a Covid infection.\n\nBy contrast, Donald Trump officially accepted his party's presidential nomination at the Republican national convention in Milwaukee on Thursday evening.\n\nHe struck a confident tone in his first speech since surviving an assassination attempt. Delegates and supporters at the convention have been in high spirits all week.\n\nMr Biden has so far taken a defiant tone in response to Democratic pressure for him to step aside as his party's candidate. He continues to enjoy the public support of many politicians, including members of the powerful Congressional black caucus.\n\nMr Schumer, the Senate Majority Leader and Mr Jeffries, the ranking Democrat in the House of Representatives, are reported to have told Mr Biden last week that their colleagues in Congress were \"concerned\" that his troubles would hit their own chances of re-election.\n\nMr Schumer said the reports were \"idle speculation\", while Mr Jeffries said his was \"a private conversation that will remain private\".\n\nCNN meanwhile reported that Mrs Pelosi had told Mr Biden that polls show he cannot win. She later slammed the reporting as a \"feeding frenzy\", but did not deny that a conversation with Mr Biden had taken place.\n\nJamie Raskin, a congressman from Maryland, wrote to Mr Biden, comparing him to a baseball pitcher at the end of his career - saying there was \"no shame\" in retiring \"to the overflowing appreciation of the crowd when your arm is tired out\".\n\nBut TJ Ducklo, a Biden campaign senior adviser, slammed reports of grandee concern as \"baseless conjecture from anonymous sources\".\n\n\"Joe Biden is his party's nominee,\" he wrote on X. \"He's running for re-election.\"\n\nDeputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks said Mr Biden was \"not wavering on anything. The president has made his decision. I don't want to be rude, but I don\u2019t know how many more times we can answer that.\"\n\nMr Biden has mild upper respiratory symptoms associated with Covid but does not have a fever, presidential doctor Kevin O'Connor said on Thursday,\n\nThe White House said he was expected to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after he arrives in the US on Wednesday.",

        "text": "Electoral votes and swing state margins, explained\nA version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nAnyone who pays any attention to US politics is bound to hear some version of this claim: The 2024 election, which will pick a president for a nation of more than 330 million people, will be decided by a small number of voters in a few key states.\n\nIn 2020, Joe Biden turned a handful of states from red to blue to defeat then-President Donald Trump. The difference between victory and defeat was a tiny fraction of voters in those states.\n\nIn 2024, it could again be small margins in these few states that are the difference between another Trump Republican presidency or a win for Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee.\n\nTrump will try to win those same states back from Democrats. The map could also change since the US population is shifting and both sides are hoping to bring a few more states into their respective column. In any event, the margins could be just as close.\n\nBut to say that a small number of voters \u201cdecide\u201d the election is a major oversimplification of the American system and how it has evolved.\n\nHere\u2019s how things work:\n\nThere are 538 Electoral Collegevotes split among the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Each state gets at least three votes, depending on the size of their congressional delegation.\n\nThe smallest states get three (they have two senators and one member of Congress). Washington, DC, also gets three. The most populous states get a lot more. California gets 54 electoral votes (it has two senators and 52 congressional districts). Texas has 40, Florida has 30, New York has 28 and so on.\n\nThe winner is the candidate who gets 270 or more electoral votes. If no candidate gets to 270 electoral votes, the House of Representatives picks the winner from among the candidates who got electoral votes.\n\nA dozen states were decided by 5 percentage points or less in either the 2016 or 2020 presidential election. In CNN\u2019s 2024 race ratings, Maine is the only one of these states rated as solidly in one party\u2019s corner, but one congressional district within Maine is seen as competitive. The other 11 states are seen as competitive in the 2024 election. See the ratings here.\n\nViewed another way, we can expect that those states where the previous elections have been close to be the ones where the 2024 election will again be close. Polling backs up this presumption.\n\nIn real numbers, the close margins in those relatively few states equal a very small number of voters in a country of more than 330 million people,but they are necessary for either candidate to reach an Electoral College count of 270. Some of those states came down to tens of thousands of votes. Biden won for Democrats in five states in 2020 \u2013 Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin \u2013 where Hillary Clinton lost, often by very small margins, in 2016. Florida, on the other hand, which has been a battleground for years, went more toward Trump in 2020.\n\nThe campaigns will focus more attentionon the fewer than one-third of all electoral votes they consider to be up for grabs or winnable by either party.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that the number of electoral votes was reallocated after the 2020 election due to the every-10-years census required by the Constitution. North Carolina, Colorado and Florida, potential battlegrounds, each gained an electoral vote. Texas, which Democrats have long hoped would become a battleground but which continues to tilt Republican despite shifting demographics, also gained two votes. Pennsylvania and Michigan are among the states that lost a vote.\n\nThat also means that the populations of these states are changing over time. A battleground in 2024 could look very different in the future. And states that seem safe for either party today could be battlegrounds in the future. For example, Virginia broke in Biden\u2019s favor by about 10 points in 2020, but some polling this year has suggested a closer race there this time around.\n\nTwo states, Maine and Nebraska, apportion some oftheir electoral votes by congressional districtrather than giving all of them to the state winner. In 2020, for instance, Biden won a single vote in Nebraska and Trump won a single vote in Maine. These individual electoral votescould be incredibly important in the event of a tight election this year.\n\nThe end result is that, yes, the 2024election could again come down to relatively few voters in relatively few states.\n\nBut questions remain over who those decisive voters are. Are they the voters who make most states reliably red or blue in most elections? Are they suburban women who were turned off by Trump in 2020, or are they people without a college degree who have moved toward the GOP? Are they minority voters or women energized by the first woman of color to be this close to the Oval Office? Are they older voters who have been trending toward Democrats or younger voters expressing an interest in Republicans? Are they more disinterested voters who only take part in the process every now and then, or is it a question of which party successfully motivates its stalwarts to turn out no matter what?\n\nIt will take all of the above for either candidate to win. However, because the margins in certain states could be so small, incremental shifts in the preference or turnout of any larger group of voters could be decisive.\n\nThis headline and story have been updated with additional information.",

These two words may continue to haunt US President Joe Biden in the coming days, as he decides whether to continue contesting the upcoming presidential election or drop out of the race. The two words were used by former US President Barack Obama when he was asked about the success of Biden\u2019s re-election campaign. This has been reported by The Washington Post.There is growing opposition to his re-election bid and the chances of him returning to the White House is decreasing as the campaign progresses. Donald Trump \u2019s popularity is only increasing after the assassination attempt last weekend. It had been earlier reported that Biden may end his election campaign during the course of this weekend.Barack Obama\u2019s involvement in the US Presidential Election 2024:The former president has been actively involved in the campaign. He is also involved in some behind the scenes action. He has accompanied Biden and participated in two fund raising events. He has also lashed out at Donald Trump calling him a threat to democracy. He has extended his support to Biden in public. Biden had served as the US Vice-President from 2009-2017 when Barack Obama was the president.However, it is his behind the scenes work that is catching all the attention. He has been speaking to some members of the US Congress who are opposing Biden\u2019s presidential nomination. He has also spoken to Biden and called on him to withdraw from the race.He has pointed out that all national surveys indicate a thumping victory for Trump which can be disastrous for the future of the party.Earlier in the US Presidential Election in 2016, at the end of his tenure, Obama had a decision to make. He could support Biden who was then the Vice-President or he could support his Secretary of State Hilary Clinton to contest the election and receive a presidential nomination from the Democratic Party . He decided on supporting the latter. It has been reported that ever since, Biden has been upset with Obama.This virtual roll call is expected before the party\u2019s national convention. It is expected to circumvent the procedure and issue Biden, a presidential nomination. His opponents argue that this will end all the opposition even as the party\u2019s future looks bleak.Biden has his own supporters and is confident of winning the upcoming election. Generally, a former president is politically experienced and his views carry the weight. It is considered seriously.",

In recent days, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have all reportedly expressed concerns in private to Mr Biden about his candidacy. Even his former running mate, former President Barack Obama, has reportedly said Mr Biden's chances of winning the election have greatly diminished. A 6 July letter from high-ranking congressman Jamie Raskin was made public on Thursday, where the Maryland representative compared the president to a baseball pitcher whose arm has \"tired out\". Mr Biden, 81, has repeatedly and defiantly declared he is \"not going anywhere\", urging his party to refocus on the task of defeating Donald Trump. But the calls to exit are nearing a crescendo as Democratic politicians, donors and voters speak out against the president's candidacy.\n\nWho wants Biden to go?\n\nLawmakers on both sides of the Capitol are coming out in growing numbers against the idea of Mr Biden staying in the race. It began five days after the June 27 debate with Lloyd Doggett, a 15-term Texas congressman, who said that it was time for Mr Biden to \"make the painful and difficult decision to withdraw\". Mr Doggett, 77, who sits on the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, said he respected \"all that President Biden has achieved\" but that the Democrat had failed to \"effectively defend his many accomplishments\" on the debate stage. Only three members of the Senate have so far publicly called for Mr Biden to drop out. They are Peter Welch of Vermont, Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and Montana's Jon Tester, who is fighting for re-election. They have been joined by House colleagues including the likes of Adam Schiff, California's likely next senator, and several members in tight re-election races of their own. The others are: Raul Grijalva of Arizona\n\nof Arizona Seth Moulton of Massachusetts\n\nof Massachusetts Mike Quigley of Illinois\n\nof Illinois Angie Craig of Minnesota\n\nof Minnesota Adam Smith of Washington\n\nof Washington Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey\n\nof New Jersey Pat Ryan of New York\n\nof New York Earl Blumenauer of Oregon\n\nof Oregon Hillary Scholten of Michigan\n\nof Michigan Brad Schneider of Illinois\n\nof Illinois Ed Case of Hawaii\n\nof Hawaii Greg Stanton of Arizona\n\nof Arizona Jim Himes of Connecticut\n\nof Connecticut Scott Peters of California\n\nof California Eric Sorensen of Illinois\n\nof Illinois Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington state\n\nof Washington state Mike Levin of California\n\nof California Brittany Pettersen of Colorado\n\nof Colorado Jim Costa of California\n\nof California Sean Casten of Illinois\n\nof Illinois Jared Huffman of California\n\nof California Marc Veasey of Texas\n\nof Texas Chuy Garcia of Illinois\n\nof Illinois Mark Pocan of Wisconsin\n\nof Wisconsin Greg Landsman of Ohio\n\nof Ohio Zoe Lofgren of California\n\n'Hard to imagine' Biden serving full term, says Michael Douglas\n\nOther prominent figures have also joined the growing chorus: New York Lt Gov Antonio Delgado , a former member of the House of Representatives, said Mr Biden \"can add to his legacy, showing his strength and grace, by ending his campaign\".\n\n, a former member of the House of Representatives, said Mr Biden \"can add to his legacy, showing his strength and grace, by ending his campaign\". Ex-Ohio congressman Tim Ryan , former housing secretary Julian Castro and self-help guru Marianne Williamson - all former primary opponents of Mr Biden - have called on him to withdraw.\n\n, former housing secretary and self-help guru - all former primary opponents of Mr Biden - have called on him to withdraw. George Clooney , the Hollywood actor and major party fundraiser, said in The New York Times that Mr Biden could not beat time. His article was titled: \"I Love Joe Biden. But We Need a New Nominee.\"\n\n, the Hollywood actor and major party fundraiser, said in The New York Times that Mr Biden could not beat time. His article was titled: \"I Love Joe Biden. But We Need a New Nominee.\" Disney heiress Abigail Disney, another megadonor, said she was suspending donations to Democrats \"unless and until they replace Biden at the top of the ticket\".\n\nWhat are others saying?\n\nSenior Democrats, including party leaders in Washington, have parsed their tongues in public on whether Mr Biden should continue his 2024 bid. Nancy Pelosi, the former House Speaker, had previously declined to directly answer whether she wanted him to keep running. She did so on MSNBC's Morning Joe, the president's favourite news programme. \"I want him to do whatever he decides to do,\" she said, adding that \"time is running short\" for him to make that call. CNN reported that since then, Mrs Pelosi had met with Mr Biden privately and told him that polls show he cannot win in November. She later slammed the reporting as a \"feeding frenzy\", but did not deny that a conversation with Mr Biden had taken place. Her replacement as House Democratic chief, Hakeem Jeffries, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer have reportedly also met Mr Biden to privately express both their concerns about his ability to win re-election and the potential impact of his candidacy on Democratic hopes of controlling the House and Senate.\n\nBiden is on 'really good form' says Starmer",

Together, as a party and as a country, we can and will defeat him at the ballot box,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThe stakes are high, and the choice is clear. Together, we will win.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m stuck at home with COVID, so I had the distinct misfortune of watching Donald Trump\u2019s speech to the RNC. What the hell was he talking about? \u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) July 20, 2024\n\nBut 12 more Democratic politicians, including two senators and a group of Congress members, called on the president to step aside.\n\nOhio Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat who is in a tough race for re-election, said in a statement late on Friday that he agrees with \u201cthe many Ohioans\u201d who have reached out to him asking for Biden to end his campaign.\n\nNew Mexico Senator Martin Heinrich, who is also up for re-election, became the third Senate Democrat to call for Biden\u2019s exit.\n\n\u201cBy passing the torch, he would secure his legacy as one of our nation\u2019s greatest leaders and allow us to unite behind a candidate who can best defeat Donald Trump and safeguard the future of our democracy,\u201d he said.\n\nTop Democratic figures, including Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries and Nancy Pelosi, have also privately pressured the president to quit, according to media reports.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going anywhere,\u201d Biden campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon said on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe show, and called him the \u201cbest person to take on Donald Trump\u201d.\n\nShe indicated that the growing unease among top Democrats about Biden\u2019s candidacy did not reflect the broader sentiment across the party.\n\nAnd in a call with donors on Friday, Vice President Kamala Harris said: \u201cWe are going to win this election,\u201d US media reported. \u201cWe know which candidate in this election puts the American people first: our president, Joe Biden.\u201d\n\n\u2018Pass the Torch\u2019\n\nA group of Biden\u2019s Democratic detractors are trying to reach him directly through a television advertisement.\n\nThe advertisement, created by the new group Pass the Torch, will start running on Monday on Morning Joe, one of Biden\u2019s favourite shows which he is known to watch regularly, and other daytime MSNBC programming.\n\n\u201cWe want to get this message \u2013 that we\u2019re so grateful for all you\u2019ve done, and now it\u2019s seriously time to pass the torch \u2013 directly to President Biden,\u201d said Aaron Regunberg, a member of Pass the Torch\u2019s steering committee.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be going up on his favourite programmes, and we plan to stay up until we hear the announcement that he\u2019s going to do the right thing and step aside. Hopefully, we\u2019ll be able to take it off the air in the very near future.\u201d\n\nNiambi Carter, an associate professor at the University of Maryland told Al Jazeera that the party would face serious challenges if Biden were to quit the race now.\n\n\u201cI think those who are calling for him to step down will have to get used to the idea and line up behind Joe Biden if he chooses to stay in the race,\u201d she told Al Jazeera. \u201cHe is allowed to do so since he won the primary with little to no challenge.\u201d\n\nCarter said Democrats are in their own way seemingly lacking the willpower exhibited by Republican rivals to march ahead.\n\n\u201cThe money the Biden campaign has made is not transferrable to a new candidate, so a lot of things need to happen very quickly if this is going to be the case, so I think it\u2019s a really short-sighted move on behalf of the Democrats.\u201d\n\nNext week, Biden is scheduled to host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who will address the US Congress on July 24 amid Israel\u2019s devastating war on Gaza.\n\nWhite House doctor Kevin O\u2019Connor said on Saturday the president had completed his sixth dose of medication and that he was still experiencing a \u201cloose, non\u00adproductive cough and hoarseness, but his symptoms continue to improve steadily\u201d.",

        "text": "Democrats pushing for Biden to exit the race are split over who would lead the ticket next\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 As Democrats churn over whether President Joe Biden should stay in the 2024 race, the party turmoil is deepening over whether his Vice President Kamala Harris is next in line for the job or if a \u201cmini primary\u201d should be quickly launched to choose a new nominee before the party\u2019s August convention.\n\nREAD MORE: These 3 Democrats didn\u2019t do better than Biden in this poll against Trump. They also didn\u2019t do any worse\n\nHarris hit the campaign fundraising circuit Saturday in breezy Provincetown, Massachusetts, and picked up a nod from the state\u2019s prominent Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who said before the visit that if Biden were to step aside, his vice president is \u201cready to step up.\u201d\n\nAt the event, which organizers said raised $2 million and was attended by 1,000 guests, Harris did not mention the calls for Biden to leave the race or for her to replace him, instead repeating one of her regular campaign lines: \u201cWe\u2019re going to win this election,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cDo we believe in freedom? Do we believe in equality? Do we believe in the promise of America? Then are we ready to fight for it?\u201d she called to a cheering crowd. \u201cWhen we fight, we win.\u201d\n\nBut installing Harris to the top of the ticket, which would be a history-making moment for the party elevating the first woman, Black person and person of South Asian descent as its presidential nominee, is not at all certain. Officials from the highest ranks, including Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, prefer an open process, some believing it would strengthen any Democratic nominee to confront Republican Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cIf you think that there is consensus among the people who want Joe Biden to leave\u2026. that they will support Kamala, Vice President Harris, you would be mistaken,\u201d Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said this week on a widely discussed social media post.\n\nWith the publicly aired deliberations, Democrats are prolonging an extraordinary moment of uncertainty and upheaval. Biden has weighty options before him this weekend that could set the direction of the country and his party as the nation heads toward the November election.\n\nIt\u2019s creating a stark juxtaposition with Republicans, who, after years of bitter and chaotic infighting over Trump, are energized and embracing the former president\u2019s far-right takeover of the GOP, despite his criminal conviction in a hush money case and pending federal criminal indictment for trying to overturn the 2020 election before the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\n\nWATCH: GOP convention ends with Trump\u2019s 3rd nomination and a unified party\n\nBiden, despite a week of campaign stops, interviews and insistence that he is the best candidate to take on Trump in a rematch, hasn\u2019t been able to quell the uproar. Skeptical Democrats doubt he can keep the White House after his stumbled debate performance last month, and worry he will take hopes for party control of Congress down with him.\n\nOn Saturday, Rep. Mark Takano, the top Democrat on the House Veterans Affairs Committee, added his name to the list of nearly three dozen Democrats in Congress who say it\u2019s time for Biden to leave the race. The Californian called on Biden to \u201cpass the torch,\u201d to Harris.\n\nMore lawmakers are expected to speak out in the days ahead. Donors have raised concerns.\n\n\u201cThere is no joy in the recognition he should not be our nominee in November,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Morgan McGarvey of Kentucky, one of the Democrats urging Biden\u2019s exit from the race.\n\nFrom his beach home in Delaware, Biden, 81, is isolating after announcing a COVID infection, but also politically with a small circle of family and close advisers. White House doctor Kevin O\u2019Connor said Saturday that Biden\u2019s symptoms were improving, but that he remained plagued by a dry cough and hoarseness. He received separate briefings Saturday on domestic and national security issues, the White House said.\n\nThe president\u2019s team insisted he\u2019s ready to return to the campaign this coming week to counter what he called a \u201cdark vision\u201d laid out by Trump.\n\n\u201cTogether, as a party and as a country, we can and will defeat him at the ballot box,\u201d Biden said in a statement Friday.\n\nBut outside the Rehoboth enclave, the debate and passions are intensifying.\n\nVery few of the Democratic lawmakers who are agitating for Biden to leave have mentioned Harris in their statements, and some have said they favor an open nominating process that would throw the party\u2019s endorsement behind a new candidate.\n\nA person familiar with Pelosi\u2019s thinking said that while she is a friend and admirer of the vice president, she believes that anybody who wants to be president is better served by such a process, believing that whoever emerges as the candidate would be strengthened to win the election. The person spoke on condition of anonymity to characterize Pelosi\u2019s thought process.\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren of California, a Pelosi ally who has called on Biden to step aside, said Friday on MSNBC that some kind of \u201cmini-primary\u201d that would include Harris makes sense.\n\nDemocratic Sens. Jon Tester of Montana and Peter Welch of Vermont have both called for Biden to exit the race and said they would favor an open nominating process at the convention.\n\n\u201cHaving it be open would strengthen whoever is the ultimate nominee,\u201d Welch said in an interview with The Associated Press.\n\nREAD MORE: Republicans ramp up attacks on Harris as talk of replacing Biden on 2024 ticket intensifies\n\nOther Democrats say it would be politically unthinkable to move to someone other than Harris, and logistically unworkable with a virtual nominating vote being planned for early next month, before the Democratic convention opens in Chicago on Aug. 19.\n\nMinnesota Rep. Betty McCollum, who has called on Biden to step aside, explicitly endorsed Harris as a replacement.\n\n\u201cTo give Democrats a strong, viable path to winning the White House, I am calling upon President Biden to release his delegates and empower Vice-President Harris to step forward to become the Democratic nominee for President,\u201d McCollum said in her statement.\n\nThe standoff over Biden\u2019s political future has become increasingly untenable for the party and its leaders, a month from the Democratic National Convention that should be a unifying moment to nominate their incumbent president to confront Trump. Instead, the party is at a crossroads unseen in generations.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what else, if anything, the president could do to reverse course and win back lawmakers and Democratic voters, who are wary of his ability to defeat Trump and serve another term,\n\nBiden, who sent a defiant letter to Democrats in Congress vowing to stay in the race, has yet to visit Capitol Hill to shore up support, an absence noticed by senators and representatives.\n\nThe president did conduct a round of virtual conversations with various caucuses in the past week \u2014 some of which ended poorly.\n\nAssociated Press writers Mary Clare Jalonick, Seung Min Kim, Farnoush Amiri and Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Trump Promises to Militarize Police, Reincarcerate Thousands, and Expand Death Penalty\nOur analysis of a potential second Trump administration's proposed criminal legal system policies include unlawful tactics that will only harm our communities.\n\nThis piece was published before Joe Biden withdrew from the 2024 presidential election and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to represent the Democratic Party. No significant facts have been changed or added. Donald Trump has long identified himself as the candidate of \u201claw and order\u201d but, during the Trump administration, \u201claw and order\u201d translated to a severe approach to criminal punishment and policing that failed to make us safer. Today, his proposed policies for a second term promise to double down on these ineffective tough on crime tactics. If reelected, a second administration threatens to accelerate mass incarceration and roll back decades of progress by encouraging aggressive policing practices, enacting draconian sentencing regimes, and expanding the use of the death penalty. At the ACLU, we won\u2019t let our country go backward. If Trump returns to office, we\u2019re prepared to meet these unconstitutional policies with the same fierce response as we did during the last Trump administration. Learn more about our roadmap in our breakdown.\n\nTrump on the Criminal Legal System\n\nThe Facts: According to Trump\u2019s campaign, \u201cthere is no higher priority than quickly restoring law and order and public safety in America.\u201d But, just as it was during President Richard Nixon\u2019s 1968 campaign against the war on drugs, \u201claw and order\u201d under a second Trump administration is a \u201cshorthand message promising repression of the Black community.\u201d Specifically, Trump\u2019s law enforcement policies call for further protections for abusive police, including condoning the use of force against protesters, which he once described as a \u201cbeautiful thing to watch.\u201d This rhetoric risks encouraging state actors to take a similarly brutal approach. Beyond rhetoric, however, Trump is also likely to immediately rescind President Joe Biden\u2019s 2022 executive order on policing. Doing so would eviscerate one of the most substantial federal actions on police reform since George Floyd\u2019s murder and roll back important changes to use of force standards, including restrictions on chokeholds and carotid restraints. These expected policies will have an outsized impact on marginalized communities, especially the Black community, which is far more likely to experience police abuse. We also know that a second Trump administration intends to deputize local law enforcement to aid an unprecedented mass deportation effort that would decimate communities. Additionally, Trump has promised that, if reelected, his administration will accelerate mass incarceration efforts by directing federal prosecutors to seek the most serious charges and maximum sentences, pressuring local prosecutors to take a similarly draconian approach, and re-incarcerating thousands of people on home confinement. His administration will also expand the use of the death penalty \u2013 despite Americans\u2019 increasing opposition to capital punishment \u2013 by broadening the category of crimes punishable by death, sentencing more people to die, and killing every person on federal death row. While Trump will have a singular impact on the federal system, ultimately, state and local governments control most of the substantive parts of state criminal legal systems, including policing, prosecution, sentencing, and conditions in prisons and jails. Today, there are over 1.6 million people in state and local jails and prisons, compared to just over 200,000 in federal jails and prisons. But even without direct control of state systems, Trump will play an important role in setting the tone for state policies and many of his plans will have a ripple effect across the country. Why It Matters: The Trump administration has already shown its capacity for brutal criminal legal system policies. In its final year, for example, the Trump Administration executed 13 people, more than half of whom were people of color. Trump executed more people than any administration in 120 years. Trump\u2019s embrace of capital punishment is longstanding. In the 1980s, as a private citizen, he paid $85,000 from his own funds to publish a page-wide advertisement calling for the execution of five Black and Latine boys wrongfully accused as the \u201cCentral Park Five.\u201d But the impact of a second Trump administration doesn\u2019t limit itself to any single area of the criminal legal system. He has proposed punitive policies that promise to dehumanize individuals at every point in the carceral system \u2013 from traffic stops to confinement conditions to sentencing. This tough on crime approach is also ineffective. Creating safe and healthy communities requires investing in programs that address the root causes of crime and disorder, like after-school programs, alternatives to policing, violence intervention teams, substance abuse treatment, employment pipelines, and affordable housing.\n\nTrump on the Criminal Legal System A second Trump administration threatens to increase inequities in our criminal legal system and reverse many reforms gained over the last two decades.\n\nSource: American Civil Liberties Union",

        "text": "What happens if Biden drops out of presidential race?\nDespite major donors reluctant to keep campaign funds flowing and more Democrats publicly saying that his chances of winning the November election are dwindling, President Joe Biden shows no public sign of stepping down.\n\n\"I look forward to getting back on the campaign trail next week,\" he said in a campaign statement.\n\nBiden is \"in this race and he's in it to win it,\" Dan Kanninen, Biden campaign battleground states director, said in a statement. \"Moreover, he's the presumptive nominee \u2014 there is no plan for an alternative nominee.\"\n\n\"It is high past time we stop fighting one another,\" Kanninen said. \"The only person who wins when we fight is Donald Trump.\"\n\nStill, if Biden does step aside, Democrats must swiftly decide who would replace him on the top of their ticket, and how.\n\nOne scenario would be for Biden to endorse an alternative candidate and ask Democratic delegates to transfer their pledged votes when they assemble next month at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nHistorically, convention delegates vote for the candidate who won the primary or caucus in their respective states. Almost all 3,896 Democratic delegates are pledged to Biden after he swept every contest in the country. But that \u201cpledge\u201d can be changed under DNC rules that allow for \u201cgood conscience\u201d to determine delegate decisions.\n\n\u201cThere may be some negotiation if Joe Biden were to decide to step aside to say, maybe we could at least encourage or endorse or try to set in place a way that Vice President [Kamala] Harris might be the nominee,\u201d said John C. Fortier, fellow focusing on elections at the American Enterprise Institute.\n\nHowever, delegates are not required to do so, Fortier told VOA. \u201cThere's not an absolute guarantee or legal way for him to switch his support to her.\u201d\n\nHarris a logical choice\n\nStill, Harris would be a logical choice to quickly coalesce delegate votes. She is already first in the line of presidential succession. Nominating a Black woman could also help secure African American votes, a core bloc of the Democratic Party\u2019s support.\n\nPublicly, she remains loyal. \u201cJoe Biden is our nominee,\u201d she said earlier this month. \u201cWe beat Trump once and we're going to beat him again. Period.\u201d\n\nAs part of the Biden-Harris ticket, Harris would make sense financially. Under campaign finance rules, Harris is entitled to spend the Biden-Harris war chest, which stands at $91 million, according to their last filing report in June.\n\nFifty-eight percent of Democrats think Harris would make a good president, according to a new poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, and about 30% percent of the public overall think she would. Forty-three percent of adults have a favorable opinion of her, including 74% of Democrats.\n\nHowever, Democrats might also want to avoid the undemocratic appearance of an automatic coronation of Harris as Biden\u2019s successor, especially if others come out to contest the nomination.\n\n\u201cThe goal of the party will be to have some sort of process before the convention and at the convention that allows whoever gets into the race to court the delegates,\u201d said Elaine Kamarck, senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings public policy organization and author of a book on how America nominates presidential candidates.\n\nThat process \u201ccould be any number of things,\u201d she told VOA. \u201cIt could be regional meetings. It could be a debate.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line is, should the president step aside, Democrats must quickly figure out who replaces him and who is likely to win the election, said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics.\n\n\u201cAnd that ought to be the same person,\u201d he told VOA. \u201cWhether they can do it in the time permitted \u2014 it\u2019s a month \u2014 is another question entirely.\u201d\n\nOpen convention possible\n\nNext month\u2019s DNC could be an open convention, where the delegates nominate someone other than Biden. It would be a contested convention if there\u2019s more than one candidate vying for the slot.\n\nA contested convention could be tumultuous and divisive, something Democrats would want to avoid two months before the election.\n\n\u201cAt this point, we don't have a contested convention. We might have an open one, but we don't have a contested one,\u201d Kamarck said. \u201cThere's no time, all right. It's a month, literally, from now to the convention. Nobody is calling delegates.\u201d\n\nIf there is a contest, floated names include California Governor Gavin Newsom, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nAt the convention, Democrats must also decide who will be at the bottom of the ticket, another process that could create both excitement and division.\n\n\u201cWhoever is the loudest in critiquing Harris' choice will probably be the sort of faction of the party that gets their nominee into the V.P. slot,\u201d said Jennifer Mercieca, professor of political communication at Texas A&M University.\n\nAhead of the November elections, that\u2019s a lot of turmoil for Democrats.\n\n\u201cIt's all speculation at this point,\u201d Mercieca told VOA. \u201cWe have no idea; we've not seen anything like this before.\u201d\n\nAt separate occasions, Biden has said that the direst of polling results could get him to quit, or if there is a \u201cmedical condition that emerged,\u201d or if the \u201cLord Almighty comes out and tells\u201d him to.\n\nThe president remains in isolation in his vacation home in Delaware, following his COVID diagnosis this week.",

        "text": "Highlights from the 2024 presidential election campaign: July 19\nTrump spoke for more than an hour, touching on a plethora of topics, but there were a number of highly anticipated subjects that the former president did not touch.\n\nThe biggest of them was the issue of reproductive rights. Abortion is one of Republicans\u2019 most difficult campaign issues. Trump takes credit for overturning national abortion rights with his appointment of three Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn Roe, but he says he wants to leave the issue to the states to set their own laws and has said he would not sign a national abortion ban.\n\nAlso not mentioned was Vice President Kamala Harris, who in recent weeks has become the target of Trump\u2019s criticism. As Democratic upheaval over President Biden\u2019s debate performance grows, there are rumors that Harris would lead the top of the ticket if Biden were to step down. Trump\u2019s campaign and allies have been adamant that Biden must remain on the top of the ticket.\n\nAnd lastly, Trump did not mention the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021. Some of his many legal battles and dozens of other Justice Department cases against his supporters center on the incident. It is a day that Democrats have used for several years to document what they say is a candidate who is a clear and present danger to democracy. Trump has mentioned the insurrection in many of his previous political speeches, but it was a topic left untouched at the RNC.",

        "text": "Election 2024: Will Joe Biden Exit the Presidential Race?\nThe nation turned its eyes to Milwaukee last night as Donald J. Trump accepted the Republican Party\u2019s presidential nomination for the third election in a row. But the question on everyone\u2019s mind inside and outside the Fiserv Forum was, who will be his opponent in November?\n\nThe pressure on Joe Biden to step aside as the Democratic presidential candidate that died down last week flared again this week. The news media reported that former President Barack Obama, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi each told Biden privately in their own way that his chances of winning were fading and that he would be imperiling the party if he stayed in the race. Jon Tester of Montana and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico became the second and third Democratic senators to call on Biden to head to the sidelines. California Democratic Senate candidate Adam Schiff, a close confidant of Pelosi\u2019s, added his name to those urging Biden to step down. Just this morning, four Democratic Congressmen asked Biden \u201cto pass the torch to a new generation of Democratic leaders.\u201d More defections, possibly a stampede of them, seem likely.\n\nBiden, who tested positive for Covid on Wednesday and had to leave the campaign trail, can\u2019t find much comfort in poll numbers or campaign contributions. An AP-NORC poll out this week found that 65 percent of Democrats want him to leave the race, and just 27 percent are very or extremely confident about his mental capacity to be an effective president. Campaign contributions in July have fallen to less than half the $50 million originally projected.\n\nThe Water's Edge James M.

The Democratic Party\u2019s rules establish a process for replacing a potential nominee.\n\nThe question is instead whether Biden will leave the race. It is difficult, though not impossible, to push him off the ticket. But that would mean a bruising internal fight that would likely guarantee what Biden\u2019s critics are seeking to prevent\u2014Trump\u2019s election. That outcome could happen even if Biden bows out gracefully. Presidential campaigns are unforgiving, especially for new candidates and campaign organizations in flux.\n\nBiden continues to signal that he will remain in the race. His campaign chair told Morning Joe today that he will return to the campaign trail next week. That, of course, is not dispositive. If Biden decides to step aside, it\u2019s in his interest and the Democratic Party\u2019s to break that news rather than telegraph it.\n\nOne group rooting for Biden to stay in the race is the Trump campaign. It has built its Election 2024 strategy around attacking his weaknesses. Indeed, Trump advisers have attacked the dump-Biden movement as illegitimate. Senior Trump campaign adviser Chris LaCivita yesterday called the effort an \u201cattempted coup.\u201d If Biden does stand down, former Trump adviser Stephen Miller has signaled the Trump campaign\u2019s likely line of attack: \u201cNothing says democracy like holding a fake primary and then having donors handpick a nominee behind closed doors.\u201d\n\nWhether Biden stays in the race or not, the protracted debate over his fitness will only further complicate U.S. foreign policy. As I have noted before, countries, like people, hedge their bets. Many foreign capitals are already concluding that they will be dealing with a new president next January and trimming their sails accordingly. And if Biden does decide to step aside, he will automatically become a lame duck. That will raise a whole new set of questions and challenges.\n\nCampaign Update\n\nLast Saturday night\u2019s attempted assassination of Trump shocked the world and raised difficult questions about why the Secret Service and other law enforcement officials ignored warning signs that a shooter threatened the president. What\u2019s unknown is how the shooting will affect the presidential race, both in terms of tone and outcome. Fears of violence on the campaign trail were voiced long before Saturday. Democratic and Republican leaders\u2014there were exceptions\u2014joined Trump and Biden in calling for calm and a lowering of the political rhetoric, but fears about escalating violence and the fraying of U.S. democracy remain real. Adding an additional layer of concern are reports that the U.S. intelligence community has compiled substantial evidence that Iran is seeking to assassinate Trump.\n\nWith the selection of J.D. Vance as Trump\u2019s running mate, Democrats and Republicans have turned to negotiations over the timing and host of a vice-presidential debate. Trump agreed back in May on behalf of his yet-to-be-named nominee to a debate on either July 23 or August 13, or on an unspecified date after the Democratic National Convention closed. Harris had previously agreed to the July and August dates. The sticking point was which network would host the event. Harris agreed to appear on CBS, while Trump called for the debate to be on Fox. The July 23 date is no longer an option, and given the uncertainty about the Democratic ticket, August 13 likely isn\u2019t either.\n\nJudge Aileen Cannon dismissed the case that Special Counsel Jack Smith filed charging Trump with mishandling classified-documents case. Cannon based her ruling on the grounds that Smith's appointment was unconstitutional. Cannon\u2019s decision rejected longstanding precedent and builds on a point that Justice Clarence Thomas made in his concurring opinion in the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision on Trump\u2019s claim to unqualified presidential immunity. The Justice Department will likely appeal Cannon\u2019s ruling. Regardless of how that appeal fares, Trump will not face prosecution on the classified-documents charges before Election Day.\n\nWhat the Candidates Are Saying\n\nTrump\u2019s acceptance speech to the Republican National Convention last night set the record for length. It clocked in at a shade over ninety-two minutes. He beat the old record, which he set back in 2016, by nearly eighteen minutes.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Trump at RNC Video Pause Video Pause Trump at RNC Embed\n\nTrump didn\u2019t break any new policy ground in his remarks. As usual, he made a number of false claims, which news outlets fact-checked even if many voters don\u2019t seem to care. On the foreign policy front, he didn\u2019t stop North Korean missile launches\u2014they resumed before he left office. He didn\u2019t defeat ISIS in a \u201ccouple of months.\u201d The fight against ISIS, which began during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, continued for more than two years into his presidency. And while China signed a $50 billion trade deal with Trump, it didn\u2019t live up to the terms of the agreement. The United States didn\u2019t leave $85 billion worth of military equipment behind in Afghanistan; the number was closer to $7 billion.\n\nBloomberg Businessweek ran a story this week based on an interview with Trump at Mar-a-Lago. Much of the interview addressed economic matters. But Trump\u2019s answer to whether he would defend Taiwan against Chinese aggression likely set off alarm bells in Taipei and triggered smiles in Beijing. Trump complained that Taiwan took away the U.S. chip industry and said:\n\nTaiwan should pay us for defense. You know, we\u2019re no different than an insurance company. Taiwan doesn\u2019t give us anything. Taiwan is 9,500 miles away. It\u2019s 68 miles away from China. A slight advantage, and China\u2019s a massive piece of land, they could just bombard it.\n\nHe went on to add that if he were China \u201cI wouldn\u2019t feel so secure right now.\u201d No doubt.\n\nJoe Biden sat down with Lester Holt of NBC News for a one-on-one interview. Most of the conversation dealt with Biden\u2019s reaction to the attempted assassination of Trump, heated rhetoric on the campaign trail, and Biden\u2019s fitness for office. Foreign policy did not get a mention.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Biden Holt Interview Video Pause Video Pause Biden Holt Interview Embed\n\nBiden did apologize for saying a week ago that \u201cit\u2019s time to put Trump in the bull\u2019s-eye.\u201d\n\nWhat the Pundits Are Saying\n\nPolitico\u2019s Jonathan Martin detailed the alarm that Trump\u2019s pick of Vance to be his running mate has created among internationalist Republicans. Martin doesn\u2019t pull any punches about the division within the GOP over how active the United States should be in the world and where: \u201cTrump didn\u2019t just select a running mate here\u2014he doused political kerosene on the raging Republican fire over foreign policy.\u201d\n\nThe New Yorker\u2019s Jonathan Blitzer explored the evolution of the network of far-right groups that are championing Trump\u2019s election and creating the agenda they hope he will enact should he return to the White House. Blitzer wrote that \u201cthe Trump campaign has tried to distance itself from the most radical aspects of Project 2025. There are no benefits\u2014only political liabilities\u2014to endorsing so many specifics. Trump\u2019s supporters already know what he stands for, in a general sense. And there is the more delicate matter of the former President\u2019s ego. \u2018He wouldn\u2019t want to be seen as taking guidance from any other human being,\u2019 the former senior White House official told me. \u2018He doesn\u2019t like to be seen as someone who doesn\u2019t know everything already.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhat the Polls Show\n\nThe Pew Research Center issued a report today showing that American adults under the age of thirty have different foreign policy priorities than their elders do. Six-out-of-ten Americans between the ages of eighteen and twenty-nine flag combating climate change as their top priority. Only about four-in-ten Americans over the age of thirty feel the same way. Conversely, nine-in-ten Americans over the age of fifty see preventing terrorism as a top priority. Just 55 percent of young Americans do. The young and the old show similar divergences on issues such as Iran, Israel, NATO, and Ukraine, with younger voters being less supportive. One thing to keep in mind. Older Americans are far more likely to vote than younger ones.\n\nThe Campaign Schedule\n\nThe Democratic National Convention opens in Chicago in thirty-one days (August 19, 2024).\n\nThe second presidential debate is in fifty-three days (September 10, 2024).\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s sentencing hearing on his New York felony convictions is in sixty-one days (September 18, 2024).\n\nThe first in-person absentee voting in the nation begins in Minnesota and South Dakota in sixty-three days (September 20, 2024).\n\nElection Day is 109 days away.\n\nInauguration Day is 185 days away.\n\nAliya Kaisar assisted in the preparation of this post.",

        "text": "Noncitizens banned from voting in federal elections but not some local races\nDespite widespread GOP claims of rampant noncitizen voter fraud, federal law bans those without citizenship from voting in presidential elections.\n\nMarcela Rosas immigrated to Southern California from the Mexican state of Michoac\u00e1n more than a decade ago in search of the American dream.\n\nShe imagined a life with a house for her three children, educational opportunities and the ability to have a say in her community. There\u2019s one cornerstone of American life that Rosas, 52, hasn\u2019t been able to access: voting.\n\nWithout the ability to elect local leaders, Rosas says she feels powerless to push for change that might improve her family\u2019s quality of life, citing issues like rising housing costs and local taxes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf I had the opportunity to vote I could choose the people I want to represent me \u2014 people who understand my needs and my issues,\u201d she said. \u201cWithout the right to vote I feel segregated from my community.\u201d\n\nRosas is one of thousands living in Santa Ana who could have the chance to vote in local elections by 2028 if city voters in November pass a ballot measure granting noncitizens limited voting power. The measure has drawn intense opposition from locals and organizations who assert that voting is a privilege that should be granted only to citizens.\n\nThe battle in Santa Ana comes as former President Trump, now the official GOP presidential nominee, and other Republicans nationwide continue to raise the specter of immigrants voting illegally in the United States to alter the outcome of election results in favor of Democrats \u2014 despite robust election surveillance laws and decades of studies that dispute claims of rampant voter fraud.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe issue has come up repeatedly during this week\u2019s Republican National Convention, more recently by former presidential candidate and current Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who said on Tuesday that a fundamental GOP party value is \u201cwe believe you need to be a citizen in order to vote.\u201d\n\nNoncitizens range from individuals who are permanent residents in the United States to those who are undocumented. It can include those who have work permits, are refugees or are here under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. Depending on the jurisdiction, there are at times certain criteria a noncitizen must meet to be able to vote in local elections.\n\nDuring a news conference in May, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said without evidence that widespread noncitizen voter fraud was \u201cunprecedented and a clear and present danger to the integrity of our election system.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEven if you weren\u2019t concerned about the drop boxes and the ballot harvesting of mail-in ballots in 2020 you definitely should be concerned that illegal aliens might be voting in 2024,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Republican-led House passed a bill this month to require proof of citizenship for voter registration, even though federal law already bans noncitizens from voting in presidential elections. Those who break the law and register to vote without citizenship status in federal elections can face imprisonment or deportation.\n\nEven so, federal law doesn\u2019t restrict states from setting their own local and statewide election rules, which could include allowing noncitizens to vote in limited local elections, like school board or city council races.\n\nFewer than two dozen cities have approved local laws that grant voting authority to noncitizens, according to Ron Hayduk, a political science professor at San Francisco State University who has studied and written books about noncitizen voting rights. No state allows noncitizens to vote in statewide elections.\n\nThe majority of those cities are in Vermont and Maryland. A handful of jurisdictions in Massachusetts have also passed local noncitizen voting ordinances, though they remain inactive without state approval, Hayduk said. New York City passed a noncitizen voting law in 2021 that a New York judge then struck down as unconstitutional. A federal judge in March rejected a challenge to a Washington, D.C., law allowing noncitizens to vote in local elections.\n\nIn California, San Francisco became the first city to grant noncitizens some voting rights via a 2016 ballot measure called Proposition N. The measure, which went into effect in 2018, granted parents of school children the chance to vote in school board races. Oakland voters approved a similar ballot measure in 2022, though the law has not been enacted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn November, Santa Ana could become the third city that grants noncitizens eligiblity to cast ballots in municipal elections. The ballot measure differs from San Francisco and Oakland\u2019s laws, granting noncitizens voting rights in local elections for mayor, council members and ballot measures.\n\nProponents say allowing noncitizens to vote is about parity and giving those who pay taxes and contribute to a community a say in their local government. In Santa Ana, which has a population of more than 310,000, there are about 5,600 Vietnamese residents and 64,000 Latinos who are not U.S. citizens, according to Tracy La, the co-founder and executive director of VietRISE.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people worrying about the state of our democracy in this country and whether democracy is under attack, but for us what we really care about is how can it be a true democracy if there are so many people in our community that can\u2019t actually vote,\u201d La said.\n\nThe rules around who can vote and for what race vary across the country, Hayduk said. Some are limited to school board races, while others apply more generally to citywide elections. Some local jurisdictions require voters to be legal permanent residents or have work permits, while others allow any noncitizen to cast a ballot.\n\nBut the idea by Trump and other Republicans that immigrants are voting carte blanche and that Democrats are using those ballots to sway elections is a myth that has been \u201croundly debunked by study after study,\u201d Hayduk said.\n\nNot only are national and statewide election laws extremely stringent, experts say, but immigrants have a lot to lose putting their names on government records.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany states, like California, allow charter cities to create their own election regulations to enfranchise noncitizen voters, Joshua Douglas, a law professor at the University of Kentucky who has studied local voting rights under state constitutions, explained in an email to The Times.\n\n\u201cDoing so does not violate the U.S. Constitution as there\u2019s nothing in the Constitution that forbids the practice, and it does not violate the state constitution in states with state constitutional language that sets a floor for voter eligibility,\u201d he said, adding that it often boils down to whether state constitutional language authorizes \u201cevery citizen\u201d to vote, or \u201conly a citizen.\u201d\n\nA wave of states in recent years have passed constitutional amendments to make it explicit that only citizens can vote, and several others, including Kentucky and North Carolina, will put the question before voters on November\u2019s ballot.\n\nEven in states that allow the practice, there are typically restrictions around how and when noncitizens gain access to the ballot.\n\nTo vote in San Francisco school board races, noncitizen voters have to prove they are of legal voting age, a resident of the city and that they are the parent, guardian or caregiver of a school-age child.\n\nSan Francisco City Atty. David Chiu, who played an instrumental role in getting the ballot measure passed first as a civil rights lawyer and later during his tenure in the state Assembly, said the law is critical to ensuring all parents \u201chave a say in the direction of their childrens\u2019 education, regardless of citizenship.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChiu said there are strict rules governing how noncitizens vote in San Francisco to ensure the program fully protects election integrity. Noncitizen voters receive special ballots that only include school board candidates, and they have to reenroll in the program after every election.\n\n\u201cI am not aware of a single incident of a noncitizen casting an illegal ballot in San Francisco,\u201d Chiu said. \u201cThese (voter fraud) claims are simply not based in reality...and I would also say they misunderstand the operational aspects of current voting programs that protect election integrity.\u201d\n\nChiu later defended Proposition N as city attorney against a lawsuit filed by a conservative legal group seeking to block the law. A San Francisco Superior Court judge initially ruled the law had violated the state Constitution, before an appeals court overturned that decision and allowed the program to continue. The ruling also applied to Oakland\u2019s law, which faced a similar legal challenge.\n\nAttorney and conservative pundit James Lacy, who led the lawsuits in San Francisco and Oakland, filed another lawsuit in May challenging language used in Santa Ana\u2019s ballot measure.\n\n\u201cIf we possess anything important in our citizenship, it\u2019s the ability to vote and to participate in the body politic of our localities in our nation,\u201d Lacy said. \u201cWhen a noncitizen is allowed to vote, it diminishes the value of citizenship. It dilutes the vote of all citizens.\u201d\n\nThe impact of the noncitizen voting laws remains unclear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2018, only 65 noncitizen residents registered to vote in San Francisco\u2019s school board election, and 59 turned in ballots, according to the city\u2019s Department of Elections. Those numbers dropped to 36 registered voters in 2020, with 31 ballots cast.\n\nWhen three San Francisco school board were removed from office in a February 2022 recall election, registered noncitizen voters swelled to 328, and 235 people voted. Registration numbers dropped dramatically for another election that fall. Noncitizen ballots in the last four school board elections accounted for a fraction of the more than 1.3 million total votes cast.\n\nUp until 1926, noncitizen voting was commonplace in most states, Hayduk said. Citizenship mattered less than other societal markers of success, such as race, gender and class, meaning white male landowners, regardless of citizenship status, usually had access to the ballot box.\n\n\u201cThis idea that the vote is eternal, it\u2019s always been fixed, is incorrect,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s evolving. Democracy is evolving.\u201d",

        "text": "What the 2024 presidential election could mean for commercial solar\nListen to the article 6 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDavid Wei is vice president of finance and operations and Raaghav Salem Karthikeyan is a corporate development MBA intern at SolarKal.\n\nSolar has been on a tear, adding a record-breaking 32.4 GW and holding its place as the incremental market share winner in new installations in 2023. The clean energy source now accounts for 53% of all new electricity generation capacity due to both lower prices and federal incentives.\n\nWith only a few months until the 2024 presidential election, commercial real estate owners are eager to understand what\u2019s at stake for those federal incentives under the next administration. Unfortunately, President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump failed to shed any light on the topic of solar policy during last month\u2019s debate, barely touching on the energy transition.\n\nWhat might a change in administration mean for the Inflation Reduction Act and solar tariffs, and how could it affect solar adoption in the U.S.? Here\u2019s what we can expect.\n\nTrump\u2019s stance on solar and the IRA\n\nDuring his time as president, Trump was largely uninvolved with solar. He did, however, introduce a four-year, 30% tariff on imported solar modules in 2018 to encourage domestic manufacturing, which was then extended by the Biden administration.\n\nNow on the campaign trail, Trump and his supporters have become frequent critics of aspects of the IRA. Trump has indicated that he would seek to dismantle many of the IRA\u2019s policies and cut program budgets significantly if reelected. However, he has primarily attacked tax credits for EVs, batteries and wind farms. Tom Pyle, a Project 2025 contributor who was on Trump\u2019s Department of Energy transition team, has also stated that the former president is not as opposed to solar energy as he is to wind projects.\n\nConsequently, while the IRA is frequently in the headlines, only certain parts of the bill seem to be at risk under a Trump administration. For instance, Trump could hinder EV growth by rolling back pollution regulations or changing Treasury Department rules around EV tax credit eligibility, but a full repeal of the IRA seems unlikely.\n\nBiden\u2019s stance and a brief history on solar tariffs\n\nMeanwhile, Biden has been a clear supporter of solar and renewables via the 2022 signing of the IRA, which pledged $369 billion in tax breaks and subsidies for promoting clean energy, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and investing in sustainable infrastructure. More recently, the Biden administration has also allowed domestic solar production to skyrocket through the implementation of tariffs.\n\nBiden began his term by extending the Trump-era solar tariffs in 2021. The following year, however, he issued a two-year pause on new tariffs to support adoption of the clean energy source and expansion of the U.S. solar industry, aligning with the goals of the IRA. Since the pause ended in June 2024, tariffs on Chinese modules have risen to 50%. The Biden administration is also considering additional tariffs on Southeast Asian manufacturers as U.S. companies continue to compete with a flood of foreign panels in the global market.\n\nAs a result, thanks in part to the IRA and tariffs, domestic solar manufacturing capacity has grown to exceed 26 GW annually under Biden, increasing module supply and creating new jobs.\n\nWill the IRA survive a change in administration?\n\nTo repeal the IRA completely is an uphill battle \u2014 both the House and Senate would need to expend significant political capital to roll it back. It\u2019s also worth noting that inertia and precedent are powerful tools. The IRA has catalyzed hundreds of billions of dollars in private investments, potentially creating nearly 200,000 jobs.\n\nSince a majority of IRA-driven investment has benefited Republican districts, unpicking the legislation would risk harming GOP constituencies. Notably, Republican states account for 58% of the projects announced under the IRA. When looking at congressional districts that have invested the most in solar since the passage of the IRA, eight of the top 10 are Republican. Although no Republicans voted for the IRA, many of its provisions have GOP support, as noted by Rep. Andrew Garbarino, R-N.Y., co-chair of the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus.\n\nWithout full congressional support, and given the aforementioned investment considerations, a change in administration will likely only stymie and delay certain parts of the IRA\u2019s implementation through bureaucratic obstacles rather than guarantee a repeal.\n\nWhy now Is the time to go solar\n\nThe IRA has been wildly successful for solar so far \u2014 domestic production is skyrocketing, and installations are at an all-time high and accelerating. Moreover, IRS rules dictate that solar production tax credits would remain available for projects that start construction by 2030, reducing the risk of uncertainty for developers.\n\nAs we approach the November elections, given the uncertainty around future policy changes, now is the most opportune time to take advantage of current policies.",

        "text": "US Presidential Elections: Biden may step down as Obama, Pelosi join voices of concerns\nAmid a Covid-19 diagnosis and growing concerns over his candidacy among Democrats, US President Joe Biden might be reconsidering his Presidential bid.\n\nWhile Biden had been facing pressure from allies to step down, former President Barack Obama, too, has told allies that he thinks Biden\u2019s path to victory has \u201cgreatly diminished\u201d, the Washington Post reported. Meanwhile, Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi explained to Biden over a call about the party\u2019s chances to lose in case he doesn\u2019t step down, reported the Associated Press.\n\nIn an anonymous interview with the New York Times, few of Biden\u2019s closest people have stated that Biden may be coming to terms with the anxious demands of other Democrats. They also said that it should not come out as a surprise if Biden chooses to announce Kamala Harris as the new President candidate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresident Biden is currently isolating at his vacation home in Rehoboth Beach in Delaware, after being diagnosed with Covid-19 on Wednesday. The Biden For President campaign has called an all-staff meeting for Friday, July 19, reported the Reuters. He has also been told that the campaign is having trouble raising money.\n\nSenator John Hickenlooper, who was in 2020 up against Biden for the Democratic presidential nomination, has told Reuters that Biden is working towards a decision on whether to stay in the presidential race that is good for the country.\n\nLate Thursday saw Montana Sen. Jon Tester became the second Democrat to call Biden out for stepping down \u201cI believe President Biden should not seek reelection to another term, \u201c he said. \u201cI have worked with President Biden when it has made Montana stronger, and I\u2019ve never been afraid to stand up to him when he is wrong,\u201d Tester said in a statement. \u201cAnd while I appreciate his commitment to public service and our country, I believe President Biden should not seek re-election to another term,\u201d he added.\n\nAs further anxiety swirled, Biden\u2019s closest friend in Congress and his campaign co-chair, Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, told The Associated Press, \u201cPresident Biden deserves the respect to have important family conversations with members of the caucus and colleagues in the House and Senate and Democratic leadership and not be battling leaks and press statements.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPressed about reports that Biden might be softening to the idea of leaving the race, his deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks maintained, \u201cHe is not wavering on anything.\u201d",

        "text": "Trump says 'drill, baby, drill,' but the record for US oil production isn't his\nCrude oil production in the U.S. averaged 12.9 million barrels per day in 2023.\n\nTrump says 'drill, baby, drill,' but the record for US oil production isn't his\n\nAs former President Donald Trump accepted his nomination at the Republican National Convention Thursday, he did not mince words on what energy policy would look like in a second Trump presidency.\n\n\"I make this pledge to the great people of America, I will end the devastating inflation crisis immediately, bring down interest rates and lower the cost of energy,\" Trump announced to the crowd at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\n\"We will drill, baby, drill,\" Trump said, garnering resounding cheers and applause from the RNC audience who began to echo the oil and gas slogan.\n\nTrump continued, claiming an increased domestic production of oil and gas would lead to a \"large-scale decline in prices,\" and added, \"We will do it at levels that nobody's ever seen before.\"\n\nRepublican presidential nominee, former U.S. President Donald Trump speaks after officially accepting the Republican presidential nomination on stage during Republican National Convention, July 18, 2024, in Milwaukee. Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nThe former president took aim at the Biden-Harris administration's push for environmental policy and mocked the Green New Deal, which was first introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Edward Markey in February 2019.\n\n\"They've spent trillions of dollars on things, having to do with the green new scam, that's a scam, and that's caused tremendous inflationary prices, in addition to the cost of energy,\" Trump claimed.\n\nHowever, during Biden's tenure, the United States has continued to produce and export the most crude oil out of any country, at any time, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nCrude oil production averaged 12.9 million barrels per day in 2023, breaking the previous U.S. and global record of 12.3 million, set in 2019, according to the agency.\n\nThroughout his bid for reelection, Trump has been vocal about his plans to double down on reliance on fossil fuels and reverse federal climate action.\n\n\"As President, I will set a national goal of ensuring that America has the No. 1 lowest cost of energy of any industrial country anywhere on Earth,\" Trump said on his campaign website.\n\nOn May 13, during a rally in Wildwood, New Jersey, Trump promised he would halt offshore wind energy projects \"on day one\" if elected.\n\n\"I'm going to write it out in an executive order. It's going to end on day one,\" Trump said, claiming that wind turbines \"kill\" whales, which was later denied by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nIn this Nov. 24, 2019 file photo, the sun sets behind a crude oil pump jack on a drill pad in Loving County, Texas. Angus Mordant/Reuters\n\nAhead of the election, several former Trump administration officials and conservative activists have released a \"Presidential Transition Project\" titled Project 2025 that lists proposals for the new administration if Trump were to take office.\n\nAmong the proposals are sweeping cuts to climate initiatives, saying the next administration will \"stop the war on oil and natural gas.\"\n\nEnding subsidies for electric vehicles, withdrawing the country from initiatives for sustainable food production, preventing federal regulators from considering the economic impact of carbon emissions and abolishing the Energy Department's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and Loan Programs Office, are listed in Project 2025.\n\nThe Republican National Convention also saw the selection of Trump's running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, who similarly went after climate initiatives during his acceptance speech.\n\nVance said the nation needs a leader who \"rejects Joe Biden and Kamala Harris' Green New Scam and fights to bring back our great American factories.\"\n\nThis seemingly marked a shift in Vance's beliefs, who, during a speech at Ohio State University in 2020, said, \"We of course have a climate problem in our society,\" and added that reliance on natural gas \"isn't going to take us to a clean energy future.\"",

        "text": "People Close to Biden Say He Appears to Accept He May Have to Leave the Race\nSeveral people close to President Biden said on Thursday that they believe he has begun to accept the idea that he may not be able to win in November and may have to drop out of the race, bowing to the growing demands of many anxious members of his party.\n\nOne of the people close to him warned that the president had not yet made up his mind to leave the race after three weeks of insisting that almost nothing would drive him out. But another said that \u201creality is setting in,\u201d and that it would not be a surprise if Mr. Biden made an announcement soon endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris as his replacement.\n\nSome people in Mr. Biden\u2019s camp have told Democratic allies that the president\u2019s resolve to stay in the race has been most shaken by three developments: The decision by Representative Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker, to weigh in so strongly, new state polls showing that his path to an Electoral College victory has grown far more remote and the boycott of key party donors.\n\nThe discussions among Mr. Biden\u2019s advisers have advanced to the point that they are talking about the best timing and other details for an announcement if the president decides to give up his bid for a second term, according to one of the people informed about the situation. While some were anticipating that an announcement could come as early as the next few days, the timing remained in flux in part because Mr. Biden is in isolation at his vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Del., after a Covid diagnosis.",

        "text": "Silicon shift? Major tech titans throw financial, political support to Trump\nMilwaukee \u2014 Amid the pomp and partying at the Republican National Convention, one development is adding to the air of triumphalism in Milwaukee: A slew of major tech players have turned their political and financial support to former President Donald Trump and the Republican Party, signaling a possible realignment in support from traditionally liberal Silicon Valley.\n\nIt began with reports at the beginning of the week that Elon Musk had pledged $45 million a month for at least the next three months to Trump's election effort. This was reinforced by the selection of Ohio Sen. JD Vance, a former venture capitalist who has nurtured close relationships with right-leaning or libertarian tech leaders in Silicon Valley, as Trump's running mate. By Tuesday, Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, co-founders of a high-flying venture capital firm, had endorsed Trump on their podcast and said they would kick in financially to support the former president.\n\nIt's an adage in American politics that \"money follows money,\" so many expect the influx of contributions from Musk and the other tech moguls to generate a lot more cash for Republicans in the coming weeks. Those at the vanguard of this trend are taking full advantage of the momentum.\n\nVenture capitalist David Sacks, a past supporter of Democrat Hillary Clinton and relatively early adopter of the Trump tech money machine, is urging his comrades to get off the sidelines and give to the Republican nominee. He took to X this week with a social media post that listed the growing number of Trump contributors, including Musk, Andreessen Horowitz, Joe Lonsdale, a co-founder of the data mining company, Palantir, and Doug Leone, the billionaire venture capitalist and major tech investor, who have all given to Trump.\n\n\"Come on in, the water's warm,\" Sacks wrote.\n\nAn angel investor in major companies like SpaceX, Uber and Palantir, Sacks believes Trump has a much larger base of support in Silicon Valley than is readily apparent but that those who back him are afraid to admit it publicly in a place where the prevailing politics have been overwhelmingly liberal. Still, he says his fellow techies are gaining the courage of their convictions and senses an inflection point.\n\n\"I think what we're seeing is that each incremental endorsement makes the next one more likely,\" Sacks told CBS News in an email. \"Now the dominoes are falling quite quickly.\"\n\nHow significant this Silicon shift is \u2014 and how lasting it will be \u2014 is a matter of debate. Some of those who closely track campaign finance say it's a bit too early to tell. Moreover, there's no sign yet that most of the dominant tech platforms, like Meta, Google or Apple, or their leaders, are moving into the Trump camp.\n\n\"This isn't about Big Tech players who have traditionally leaned Democratic switching sides,\" said Anna Massoglia of OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan watchdog group that keeps tabs on political donations. \"Instead, we're seeing an anti-establishment conservative faction starting to become more politically active,\" Massoglia added, cautioning that there is not enough data yet to know whether this represents a sea change or just a temporary shift.\n\nEither way, campaign finance experts say the amount of money moving to Trump is significant and could have a material effect in this election cycle. If Elon Musk follows through on his pledge $45 million per month pledge, he'd immediately catapult into the ranks of the top five or 10 donors of the past few elections, including mega-donors like George Soros, who backs Democrats, and Miriam Adelson and her late husband Sheldon, who has bankrolled Trump the tune of more than $200 million.\n\nMusk and many of his fellow tech titans who have opened up the spigot for Trump are backing Trump for the first time. Some have supported Democrats, including Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and Joe Biden in 2020.\n\n\"What's new here is the emergence of a group of people who were not previously committed now spending hundreds of millions of dollars trying to elect Republicans and certainly trying to get Donald Trump elected,\" says Saurav Ghosh, director of federal campaign finance reform at the Campaign Legal Center.\n\nBut why is this shift happening in the first place? There are different theories.\n\nTo the Trump campaign, the shift is the result of its candidate's pro-business agenda.\n\n\"In the tech sector we've seen this surge of support as fundamentally driven by President Trump's pro-business vision, reducing regulatory burdens and producing an economic environment in which American innovation can thrive,\" said Brian Hughes, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign.\n\nIn some instances, the connection between policies and financial support from the tech world has been explicit. The cryptocurrency industry's underwriting of the Trump election effort is one such example. After a months-long conversation between prominent crypto investors \u2014 including Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss \u2014 and the Trump campaign, the former president publicly embraced cryptocurrencies. The campaign's website declared that it was part of a counteroffensive against \"socialistic government control.\" Not long after that, the Winklevoss twins each donated a cool $1 million in Bitcoin to Trump, while slapping at Mr. Biden's \"war against crypto.\" The Trump campaign opened a portal to accept crypto donations, the first major party general election presidential campaign to do so.\n\nThe crypto industry's embrace of Trump has been disconcerting to some Democrats. The Washington Post reported that Biden administration officials held a meeting last week to try to repair the relationship. According to the report, Biden senior adviser Anita Dunn \"appeared taken aback by the open hostility\" from the tech start-up community.\n\nEven in Trump world there is a sharp debate about how meaningful the recent flow of tech money into the Trump reelection effort is. Roger Stone, one of the most fervent Trump supporters and a MAGA diehard, expressed skepticism.\n\n\"I suspect it's transactional for this election,\" Stone said in the bar of Milwaukee's tony Trade Hotel, where the high command of the Trump campaign was staying during the convention. He attributed the development to Vance's selection as VP.\n\nIt is true that many of the biggest players in Silicon Valley who have supported Trump, including Musk and David Sacks, are also big boosters of Vance. Musk hailed Trump's choice on X shortly after it was announced. For his part, Sacks kicked in a million dollars to Vance's 2022 Ohio Senate campaign, and Vance was instrumental in organizing a $12 million Trump fundraiser that Sacks co-hosted in June.\n\nBut the tech mogul most important to Vance's political rise has a more complicated history with Trump. Peter Thiel, the mercurial co-founder of PayPal and Palantir, met Vance when he was a law student at Yale and took him under his wing, giving him jobs, contributing lavishly to his political campaigns, and eventually introducing him to Trump.\n\nThiel was the first major Silicon Valley player to open up his wallet for Trump, when he donated $1.25 million during the 2016 campaign. That earned him a speaking gig at the GOP convention in Cleveland and sent tremors through Silicon Valley and drew scorn from many other tech leaders.\n\nBut tech titans can be fickle with their money. Eight years after breaking a Silicon Valley taboo and wholeheartedly backing Trump, Thiel decided that he is disillusioned with the former president \u2014 and other politicians \u2014 who he believes haven't delivered the change they promised. He recently announced that he won't be giving any money to Trump or other candidates. \"You hold a gun to my head and I will vote for Trump,\" he said at the Aspen Ideas Festival in June.",

        "text": "Donald Trump's war against \u2018Deep State\u2019, its link with Biden and impact on 2024 US election | Explained\nDonald Trump, who kicked off his third presidential campaign last year in March, described the 2024 contest to unseat US President Joe Biden as \u201cthe final battle\u201d. Addressing a rally in Waco, Texas, he asserted, in this race \u201ceither the deep state destroys America or we destroy the deep state.\u201d While Donald Trump has been using the term \"deep state\" for long, Biden's critic have alleged that his administration is being run by the \"deep state\".(AP )\n\nForeign policy experts and political scientists use the term \u201cdeep state\u201d to refer to people and organisations who exercise power in civil society and over political leaders. They mostly applied it to developing nations like Pakistan, Egypt and Turkey, where generals and spies made all the crucial decisions and changed elected officials when they felt it appropriate.\n\nThe Deep State and its origin\n\nThe deep state, according to an American political conspiracy theory, is a covert network of federal employees, particularly those who work for the FBI and CIA, that collaborates with prominent figures from the financial and business sectors to wield power alongside or inside the democratically elected US government.\n\nThe term \u201cdeep state\u201d was first used in the 1990s to refer to what was thought to be a long-standing deep state in Turkey. However, the phrase was later used to describe the US government, particularly under the Obama administration. However, the thesis gained widespread acceptance under Trump's presidency, as he alleged that the purported \u201cdeep state\u201d was working against him and the policies of his government.\n\nDuring Obama's presidency, the focus was on the unsettling accuracy of \u201ctargeted killings\u201d carried out by drones, followed by the controversy surrounding Snowden, the former contractor for the National Security Agency whose 2013 disclosures revealed the startling extent of government eavesdropping. \u201cThere's definitely a deep state. Trust me, I have been there,\u201d he told the Nation in 2014.\n\nApproximately half of Americans, according to opinion polls conducted in 2017 and 2018, believe the United States has a deep state.\n\nTrump vows to \u2018dismantle the deep state\u2019\n\nTrump's obsession with deep state is not something new. He has been promoting this theory since special counsel Robert Mueller began the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.\n\nTrump used the term to criticise leakers and whistleblowers from the US intelligence establishment during his tenure as the president. A large number of the January 6 Capitol rioters drew inspiration from conspiracy theories disseminated by QAnon, which asserted that a deep state was conspiring to destabilise Trump and deceive the electorate. Moreover, Trump has pledged to \u201cdismantle the deep state\u201d if he is elected in November by removing the civil service safeguards that shield thousands of government employees.\n\nFollowing recent assassination attempt on Trump, social media flooded with several conspiracy theories with few calling the attack \u201cstaged\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, one of the US-based account suggested with a history of disseminating misinformation wrote: \u201cThis is price you pay when you take down the elite satanic paedophiles,\u201d referring to the conspiracy theory put forth by QAnon, which contends that Trump is fighting a secret battle against the deep state.\n\nWithout providing any proof to back up the claim, they stated that the \u201corder\u201d for the assassination \"likely came from the CIA\", and accused Mike Pence, Hillary Clinton, and Obama of being complicit. The viral post has so far garnered over 6.9 million views.\n\n\u201cThis is either one of the worst failures in Secret Service history or a deep state plot. There\u2019s no way this should have ever happened,\u201d tweeted Brad Parscale, Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign manager.\n\nBiden and the Deep State\n\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova recently claimed that the media and the US' \u201cdeep state\u201d have long concealed Biden's actual mental status from the public.\n\nZakharova stated that those who wished to show Biden as capable had instead made things worse. She was reacting after Biden addressed Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the president of Ukraine, as \u201cPresident Putin\u201d.\n\nRussian state media commentators, who have been warning that Democrats would kill Trump, have suggested that Russia's Federal Security Service should begin \"protecting our Donald.\"\n\nRussian propagandists are now accusing both the Democrats and the Ukrainians of attempting to kill Trump. \u201cThe Democratic party is behind this attempted assassination,\u201d claimed former New York Times correspondent John Varoli on the Solovyov Live network's show, At Dawn, on Sunday.\n\nThe presenter further aired a clip from Saturday Night Live in which Jim Carrey makes fun of Biden brandishing a gun as Ponomar implies the President would rather \u201cshoot his opponents.\u201d According to Ponomar, Biden and the \"deep state\" are all set to drown the United States and the rest of the globe in blood. Giving his consent to the claim, Varoli alleged, \u201cJoe Biden is a terrorist.\u201d\n\nHe went on to say that the government controls the Secret Service and other US intelligence services, absurdly implying that they are \u201cfull of liberals\u201d and may have been involved in an attempt on Trump.\n\nAs Biden's capacity to serve another term is being questioned, especially following the presidential debate against Trump, Republicans and some Democrats have urged him to withdraw from the race.\n\nAlso Read: Donald Trump's decision to pick JD Vance was influenced by 3 key figures and assassination warning: Report\n\nIs Deep State controlling the US?\n\nSenator Tommy Tuberville of Alabama highlighted Biden's competence on the Fox News program \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" claiming that Democratic politicians and the \u201cdeep state\u201d have been controlling the incumbent President.\n\nHe alleged that Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi and Obama have been leading the country along with National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Secretary of State Antony Blinken. \u201cYou can tell by Schumer\u2019s actions, Pelosi\u2019s actions, the first two years they were calling the shots.\u201d\n\nHe hopes Americans will understand that control is with Schumer and Pelosi and all the deep state and not Biden. \u201cThe deep state\u2019s total control over this and hopefully we can get control of it and get the Democrats out of power and get Trump and all the Republicans running this country.\u201d\n\nHere's what experts have to say on Deep State\n\nExperts mostly disregarded claims about the deep state. According to Megan Squire, deputy director for data analytics at the Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Project, \u201cincidents of political violence spawn conspiracy theories and false narratives when people try to spin the event to suit their various agendas,\u201d as reported by The Washington Post.\n\nDavid Rohde, an author of In Deep: The FBI, the CIA, and the Truth About America\u2019s Deep State, stated that the term \u201cdeep state\u201d has been used by Trump and his allies to avoid criticism. He believes that \u201cdeep state\u201d is both a true phenomenon and a toxic distraction, as per Vox.",

        "text": "FiveThirtyEight\nAmerican news website\n\n538, originally rendered as FiveThirtyEight, is an American website that focused on opinion poll analysis, politics, economics, and sports blogging in the United States.[2] Founder Nate Silver left in 2023, taking the rights to his forecasting model with him to his website Silver Bulletin.[3][4][5] 538's new owner Disney hired G. Elliott Morris to develop a new model.[3][4] On September 18, 2023, the original website domain at fivethirtyeight.com was closed, and web traffic became redirected to ABC News pages.[2] The logo was replaced, with the name 538 now used instead of FiveThirtyEight.\n\nThe website, which takes its name from the number of electors in the United States electoral college,[538 1] was founded on March 7, 2008, as a polling aggregation website with a blog created by analyst Nate Silver. In August 2010, the blog became a licensed feature of The New York Times online and was renamed FiveThirtyEight: Nate Silver's Political Calculus. In July 2013, ESPN acquired FiveThirtyEight, hiring Silver as editor-in-chief and a contributor for ESPN.com; the new publication launched on March 17, 2014.[6] Since then, the FiveThirtyEight blog has covered a broad spectrum of subjects including politics, sports, science, economics, and popular culture. In 2018, the operations were transferred from ESPN to sister property ABC News (also under parent The Walt Disney Company).\n\nDuring the presidential primaries and general election of 2008 the site compiled polling data through a unique methodology derived from Silver's experience in sabermetrics to \"balance out the polls with comparative demographic data\".[7][8] Silver weighted \"each poll based on the pollster's historical track record, sample size, and recentness of the poll\".[9] Since the 2008 election, the site has published articles\u2014typically creating or analyzing statistical information\u2014on a wide variety of topics in current politics and political news. These included a monthly update on the prospects for turnover in the Senate; federal economic policies; Congressional support for legislation; public support for health care reform, global warming legislation and LGBT rights; elections around the world; marijuana legalization; and numerous other topics. The site and its founder are best known for election forecasts, including the 2012 presidential election in which FiveThirtyEight correctly predicted the vote winner of all 50 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nFiveThirtyEight has won numerous awards. These include Bloggie Awards for Best Political Coverage in 2008 and Best Weblog about Politics in 2009 as well as Webbies for Best Political Blog in 2012 and 2013. While under the ownership of ESPN in 2016, FiveThirtyEight won the Data Journalism Website of the Year award from the Global Editors Network.\n\nMethods [ edit ]\n\nOne aspect of the site is Silver's efforts to rank pollsters by accuracy, weight their polls accordingly, and then supplement those polls with his own electoral projections based on demographics and prior voting patterns. Silver said: \"I did think there was room for a more sophisticated way of handling these things.\"[10][11]\n\nFiveThirtyEight weighs pollsters' historical track records through a complex methodology,[538 2] and assigns them values to indicate \"Pollster-Introduced Error\". At its base, Silver's method is similar to other analysts' approaches to taking advantage of the multiple polls that are conducted within each state: he averaged the polling results. But especially in the early months of the election season polling in many states is sparse and episodic. The \"average\" of polls over an extended period (perhaps several weeks) would neither reveal the true state of voter preferences at the present time, nor provide an accurate forecast of the future. One approach to this problem was followed by Pollster.com: if enough polls were available, it computed a locally weighted moving average or LOESS.\n\nWhile adopting such an approach in his own analysis, Silver reasoned that there was additional information available in polls from \"similar\" states that might help to fill the gaps in information about the trends in a given state. Accordingly, he adapted an approach that he had previously used in his baseball forecasting: using nearest neighbor analysis he first identified \"most similar states\" and then factored into his electoral projections for a given state the polling information from \"similar states\". He carried this approach one step further by also factoring national polling trends into the estimates for a given state. Thus, his projections were not simply based on the polling trends in a given state.\n\nFurthermore, a basic intuition that Silver drew from his analysis of the 2008 Democratic party primary elections was that the voting history of a state or Congressional district provided clues to current voting. This is what allowed him to beat all the pollsters in his forecasts in the Democratic primaries in North Carolina and Indiana, for example.[12] Using such information allowed Silver to come up with estimates of the vote preferences even in states for which there were few if any polls. For his general election projections for each state, in addition to relying on the available polls in a given state and \"similar states\", Silver estimated a \"538 regression\" using historical voting information along with demographic characteristics of the states to create an estimate that he treated as a separate poll (equivalent to the actually available polls from that state). This approach helped to stabilize his projections, because if there were few if any polls in a given state, the state forecast was largely determined by the 538 regression estimate.\n\nTransparency of pollster ratings [ edit ]\n\nOn June 6, 2010, FiveThirtyEight posted pollster rankings that updated and elaborated Silver's efforts from the 2008 election. Silver expanded the database to more than 4,700 election polls and developed a model for rating the polls that was more sophisticated than his original rankings.[538 3][13] Silver responded on 538: \"Where's the transparency? Well, it's here [citing his June 6 article], in an article that contains 4,807 words and 18 footnotes. Every detail of how the pollster ratings are calculated is explained. It's also here [referring to another article], in the form of Pollster Scorecards, a feature which we'll continue to roll out over the coming weeks for each of the major polling firms, and which will explain in some detail how we arrive at the particular rating that we did for each one\".[538 4]\n\nAs for why the complete 538 polling database had not been released publicly, Silver responded: \"The principal reason is because I don't know that I'm legally entitled to do so. The polling database was compiled from approximately eight or ten distinct data sources, which were disclosed in a comment which I posted shortly after the pollster ratings were released, and which are detailed again at the end of this article. These include some subscription services, and others from websites that are direct competitors of this one. Although polls contained in these databases are ultimately a matter of the public record and clearly we feel as though we have every right to use them for research purposes, I don't know what rights we might have to re-publish their data in full.\" Silver also commented on the fact that the 538 ratings had contributed to Markos Moulitsas's decision to end Daily Kos's use of Research 2000 as its pollster.[14]\n\nOn June 11, 2010, Mark Blumenthal also commented on the question of transparency in an article in the National Journal titled \"Transparency In Rating: Nate Silver's Impressive Ranking Of Pollsters' Accuracy Is Less Impressive In Making Clear What Data Is Used\".[15] He noted that in the case of Research 2000 there were some discrepancies between what Silver reported and what the pollster itself reported. Other researchers questioned aspects of the methodology.[16]\n\nOn June 16, 2010, Silver announced on his blog that he is willing to give all pollsters who he had included in his rating a list of their polls that he had in his archive, along with the key information that he used (poll marginals, sample size, dates of administration); and he encouraged the pollsters to examine the lists and the results to compare them with the pollster's own record and make corrections.[538 5]\n\nIn September 2014, Silver put into the public domain all of his pollster ratings,[538 6] as well as descriptive summary data for all of the more than 6,600 polls in his data collection for the final three weeks of U.S. presidential primaries and general elections, state governor elections, and U.S. Senate and U.S. Congress elections for the years 1998\u20132012.[17] In addition to updating his pollster ratings, he published an updated methodological report.[538 7]\n\nOrigin [ edit ]\n\nLogo for FiveThirtyEight until 2023\n\nNate Silver started FiveThirtyEight in early March 2008, published under the pseudonym Poblano, the same name that he had used since November 2007 when he began publishing a diary on the political blog Daily Kos.[18] The name FiveThirtyEight derives from the 538 electors in the United States Electoral College.[19] Writing for Daily Kos, Silver had gained a following, especially for his primary election forecast on Super Tuesday, February 5, 2008.[20][21] From that primary election day, which included contests in 24 states plus American Samoa, Poblano predicted that Barack Obama would come away with 859 delegates, and Hillary Clinton 829; in the final contests, Obama won 847 delegates and Clinton 834. Based on this result, New York Times op-ed columnist William Kristol wrote: \"And an interesting regression analysis at the Daily Kos Web site (poblano.dailykos.com) of the determinants of the Democratic vote so far, applied to the demographics of the Ohio electorate, suggests that Obama has a better chance than is generally realized in Ohio\".[22]\n\nFiveThirtyEight gained further national attention for beating out most pollsters' projections in the North Carolina and Indiana Democratic party primaries on May 6, 2008. As Mark Blumenthal wrote in National Journal, \"Over the last week, an anonymous blogger who writes under the pseudonym Poblano did something bold on his blog, FiveThirtyEight.com. He posted predictions for the upcoming primaries based not on polling data, but on a statistical model driven mostly by demographic and past vote data. ... Critics scoffed. Most of the public polls pointed to a close race in North Carolina. ... But a funny thing happened. The model got it right.\"[12] Silver relied on demographic data and on the history of voting in other states during the 2008 Democratic primary elections.[10] On May 30, 2008, Silver revealed his true identity for the first time to his FiveThirtyEight readers.[538 8] After that date, he published just four more diaries on Daily Kos.[18]\n\nAs the primary season was coming to an end, Silver began to build a model for the general election race. This model, too, relied in part on demographic information but mainly involved a complex method of aggregating polling results. In 2008, Rasmussen Reports had an apparently short-term partnership with FiveThirtyEight in order to include this unique methodology for generating poll averages in their \"Balance of Power Calculator\".[23] At the same time, FiveThirtyEight's daily \"Today's Polls\" column began to be mirrored on \"The Plank\", a blog published by The New Republic.[24]\n\nIn July 2008, the site began to report regular updates of projections of 2008 U.S. Senate races. Special procedures were developed relying on both polls and demographic analysis. The projections were updated on a weekly basis.[538 9]\n\nBy early October 2008, FiveThirtyEight approached 2.5 million visitors per week, while averaging approximately 400,000 per weekday.[538 10] During October 2008 the site received 3.63 million unique visitors, 20.57 million site visits, and 32.18 million page views.[538 11] On Election Day, November 4, 2008, the site had nearly 5 million page views.[25]\n\nFinal projections of 2008 elections [ edit ]\n\nIn the final update of his presidential forecast model at midday of November 4, 2008, Silver projected a popular vote victory by 6.1 percentage points for Barack Obama and electoral vote totals of 349 (based on a probabilistic projection) or 353 (based on fixed projections of each state).[538 12] Obama won with 365 electoral college votes. Silver's predictions matched the actual results everywhere except in Indiana and the 2nd congressional district of Nebraska, which awards an electoral vote separately from the rest of the state. His projected national popular vote differential was below the actual figure of 7.2 points.\n\nThe forecasts for the Senate proved to be correct for every race, but the near stalemate in Minnesota led to a recount that was settled only on June 30, 2009. In Alaska, after a protracted counting of ballots, on November 19 Republican incumbent Ted Stevens conceded the seat to Democrat Mark Begich, an outcome that Silver had forecast on election day.[26] In Georgia, a run-off election on December 2 led to the re-election of Republican Saxby Chambliss, a result that was also consistent with Silver's original projection.\n\nThe ground game and \"On the Road\" [ edit ]\n\nDuring the 2008 electoral campaign, Sean Quinn, a second contributor, drew on his knowledge and experience with campaign organizations to evaluate the ground game and \"get out the vote\" strategies of the McCain and Obama campaign teams. A poker player, Quinn drew an analogy between Barack Obama's electoral strategy and a poker player having multiple \"outs\" for winning a hand.[27]\n\nIn September, Quinn launched a series of essays under the name On the Road.[28] Quinn traveled from state to state telling the story of the campaign from the electoral battleground, drawing on observations and interviews with grassroots campaign workers.\n\nAfter the 2008 U.S. election [ edit ]\n\nFocus [ edit ]\n\nDuring the first two months after the election, no major innovations in content were introduced. A substantial percentage of the articles focused on Senatorial races: the runoff in Georgia, won by Saxby Chambliss; recounts of votes in Alaska (won by Mark Begich), and Minnesota (Al Franken vs. Norm Coleman); and the appointments of Senatorial replacements in Colorado, New York, and Illinois.\n\nAfter President Obama's inauguration, Sean Quinn reported that he was moving to Washington, D.C., to continue political writing from that locale.[538 13] On February 4, 2009, he became the first blogger to join the White House press corps.[538 14] After that time, however, he contributed only a handful of articles to FiveThirtyEight.\n\nDuring the post-2008 election period Silver devoted attention to developing some tools for the analysis of forthcoming 2010 Congressional elections,[538 15][538 16] as well as discussing policy issues and the policy agenda for the Obama administration, especially economic policies.[538 17][538 18] He developed a list of 2010 Senate races in which he made monthly updates of predicted party turnover.[538 19]\n\nLater, Silver adapted his methods to address a variety of issues of the day, including health care reform, climate change, unemployment, and popular support for same-sex marriage.[29] He wrote a series of columns investigating the credibility of polls by Georgia-based firm Strategic Vision, LLC. According to Silver's analysis, Strategic Vision's data displayed statistical anomalies that were inconsistent with random polling. Later, he uncovered indirect evidence that Strategic Vision may have gone as far as to fabricate the results of a citizenship survey taken by Oklahoma high school students, which led him to denounce Strategic Vision as \"disreputable and fraudulent\".[30][538 20][538 21][538 22][538 23][538 24][31][a] FiveThirtyEight devoted more than a dozen articles to the Iranian presidential election in June 2009, assessing of the quality of the vote counting. International affairs columnist Renard Sexton began the series with an analysis of polling leading up to the election;[538 25] then posts by Silver, Andrew Gelman and Sexton analyzed the reported returns and political implications.[538 26]\n\nFiveThirtyEight covered the November 3, 2009, elections in the United States in detail.[538 27][538 28] FiveThirtyEight writers Schaller, Gelman, and Silver also gave extensive coverage to the January 19, 2010 Massachusetts special election to the U.S. Senate. The \"538 model\" once again aggregated the disparate polls to correctly predict that the Republican Scott Brown would win.[538 29]\n\nIn spring 2010, FiveThirtyEight turned a focus on the United Kingdom general election scheduled for May 6, with a series of more than forty articles on the subject that culminated in projections of the number of seats that the three major parties were expected to win.[538 30] Following a number of preview posts in January[538 31] and February,[538 32] Renard Sexton examined subjects such as the UK polling industry[538 33][538 34][538 35] and the 'surge' of the third-party Liberal Democrats,[538 36] while Silver, Sexton and Dan Berman[b] developed a seat projection model. The UK election was the first time the FiveThirtyEight team did an election night 'liveblog' of a non-U.S. election.[538 37]\n\nIn April 2010, The Guardian published Silver's predictions for the 2010 United Kingdom General Election. The majority of polling organisations in the UK use the concept of uniform swing to predict the outcome of elections. However, by applying his own methodology, Silver produced very different results, which suggested that a Conservative victory might have been the most likely outcome.[33] After a series of articles, including critiques and responses to other electoral analysts, his \"final projection\" was published on the eve of the election.[538 38] In the end, Silver's projections were off the mark, particularly compared with those of some other organizations, and Silver wrote a post mortem on his blog.[538 39] Silver examined the pitfalls of the forecasting process,[538 39] while Sexton discussed the final government agreement between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats.[538 40]\n\nPartnership with The New York Times: 2010\u20132013 [ edit ]\n\nOn June 3, 2010, Silver announced that in early August the blog would be \"relaunched under a NYTimes.com domain\".[538 41][34][35] The transition took place on August 25, 2010, with the publication of Silver's first FiveThirtyEight blog article online in The New York Times.[538 42]\n\nOn June 3, 2010, The New York Times and Silver announced that FiveThirtyEight had formed a partnership under which the blog would be hosted by the Times for a period of three years.[36] In legal terms, FiveThirtyEight granted a \"license\" to the Times to publish the blog. The blog would be listed under the \"Politics\" tab of the News section of the Times.[37] FiveThirtyEight would thus be subject to and benefit from editing and technical production by the Times, while FiveThirtyEight would be responsible for creating the content.\n\nSilver received bids from several major media entities before selecting the Times.[37][38] Under terms of the agreement, Silver would also write monthly articles for the print version of both the newspaper and the Sunday magazine.[538 41] Silver did not move his blog to the highest bidder, because he was concerned with maintaining his own voice while gaining the exposure and technical support that a larger media company could provide. \"There's a bit of a Groucho Marx quality to it [Silver has said]. ... You shouldn't want to belong to any media brand that seems desperate to have you as a member, even though they'll probably offer the most cash\".[39]\n\nThe first column of the renamed FiveThirtyEight: Nate Silver's Political Calculus appeared in the Times on August 25, 2010, with the introduction of U.S. Senate election forecasts. At the same time, Silver published a brief history of the blog.[538 43] All columns from the original FiveThirtyEight were also archived for public access.[40]\n\nShortly after FiveThirtyEight relocated to The New York Times, Silver introduced his prediction models for the 2010 elections to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, and state Governorships. Each of these models relied initially on a combination of electoral history, demographics, and polling. The 538 model had forecast a net pickup of 8 seats by the Republicans in the Senate and 55 seats in the House, close to the actual outcome of a pickup of 6 seats in the Senate and 63 seats in the House.[538 44]\n\nWriters [ edit ]\n\nWhen the transition to The New York Times was announced, Silver listed his staff of writers for the first time.[40] However, of the seven listed writers, only three of them had published on 538/New York Times by late December 2010: Silver, Renard Sexton and Hale Stewart. Andrew Gelman contributed again in early 2011.[538 45] Brian McCabe published his first article in January 2011.[538 46][c]\n\nBeginning in 2011, one writer who emerged as a regular contributor was Micah Cohen. Cohen provided a periodic \"Reads and Reactions\" column in which he summarized Silver's articles for the previous couple of weeks, as well as reactions to them in the media and other blogs, and suggested some additional readings related to the subject of Silver's columns. Silver identified Cohen as \"my news assistant\".[538 47] Cohen also contributed additional columns on occasion.[538 48]\n\nOn September 12, 2011, Silver introduced another writer: \"FiveThirtyEight extends a hearty welcome to John Sides, a political scientist at George Washington University, who will be writing a series of posts for this site over the next month. Mr. Sides is also the founder of the blog The Monkey Cage, which was named the 2010 Blog of the Year by The Week magazine\".[538 49]\n\nBeyond electoral politics [ edit ]\n\nWhile politics and elections remained the main focus of FiveThirtyEight, the blog also sometimes addressed sports, including the March Madness[538 50][538 51][42] and the 2012 NCAA Men's Basketball tournament selection process,[538 52] the B.C.S. rankings in NCAA college football,[43] the NBA,[538 53][538 54][538 55] and Major League Baseball matters ranging from the 2011 attendance at the New York Mets' Citi Field[538 56] to the historic 2011 collapse of the Boston Red Sox.[538 57] The site has also posted forecasts for the Academy Awards.[44]\n\nIn addition, FiveThirtyEight sometimes turned its attention to other topics, such as the economics of blogging,[538 58] the financial ratings by Standard & Poors,[538 59] economists' tendency to underpredict unemployment levels,[538 60] and the economic impact and media coverage of Hurricane Irene (2011).[538 61][538 62]\n\nAdapted from a FiveThirtyEight October 2011 graph published in The New York Times [ 538 63 ]\n\nFiveThirtyEight published a graph showing different growth curves of the news stories covering Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street protests. Silver pointed out that conflicts with the police caused the sharpest increases in news coverage of the protests[538 63] and assessed the geography of the protests by analyzing news reports of the size and location of events across the United States.[538 64]\n\n2012 U.S. elections [ edit ]\n\nFiveThirtyEight rolled out its 2012 general election forecasting model on June 7, 2012. The model forecast both the popular vote and the Electoral College vote, with the latter being central to the exercise and involving a forecast of each state. In the initial forecast, Barack Obama was estimated to have a 61.8% chance of winning the electoral vote. The website provided maps and statistics about the electoral outcomes in each state as well as nationally. Later posts addressed methodological issues such as the \"house effects\" of different pollsters as well as the validity of telephone surveys that did not call cell phones.[538 65]\n\nOn the morning of November 6, Election Day, Silver's model gave President Obama a 90.9% chance of winning a majority of the electoral votes.[538 66] The 538 model correctly predicted the winner of all 50 states and the District of Columbia.[45][d] Silver, along with at least two academic-based analysts who aggregated polls from multiple pollsters, thus not only correctly predicted all 50 states, but also all nine \"swing states\".[46] In contrast, individual pollsters were less successful. For example, Rasmussen Reports \"missed on six of its nine swing-state polls\".[47]\n\nAn independent analysis of Silver's state-by-state projections, assessing whether the percentages of votes that the candidates actually received fell within the \"margin of error\" of Silver's forecasts, found that \"48 out of 50 states actually fell within his margin of error, giving him a success rate of 96%. And assuming that his projected margin of error figures represent 95 percent confidence intervals, which it is likely they did, Silver performed just about exactly as well as he would expect to over 50 trials. Wizard, indeed\".[48][49] Additional tests of the accuracy of the electoral vote predictions were published by other researchers.[50][51]\n\nESPN and ABC News affiliation [ edit ]\n\nIn July 2013, it was revealed that Silver and his FiveThirtyEight blog would depart The New York Times and join ESPN.[52] In its announcement of its acquisition of FiveThirtyEight, ESPN reported that \"Silver will serve as the editor-in-chief of the site and will build a team of journalists, editors, analysts and contributors in the coming months. Much like Grantland, which ESPN launched in 2011, the site will retain an independent brand sensibility and editorial point-of-view, while interfacing with other websites in the ESPN and Disney families. The site will return to its original URL, www.FiveThirtyEight.com.\"[53]\n\nAccording to Silver, the focus of FiveThirtyEight in its ESPN phase would broaden: \"People also think it's going to be a sports site with a little politics thrown in, or it's going to be a politics site with sports thrown in. ... But we take our science and economics and lifestyle coverage very seriously. ... It's a data journalism site. Politics is one topic that sometimes data journalism is good at covering. It's certainly good with presidential elections. But we don't really see politics as how the site is going to grow\".[54]\n\nFiveThirtyEight launched its ESPN webpage on March 17, 2014. The lead story by Silver explained that \"FiveThirtyEight is a data journalism organization. ... We've expanded our staff from two full-time journalists to 20 and counting. Few of them will focus on politics exclusively; instead, our coverage will span five major subject areas \u2013 politics, economics, science, life and sports. Our team also has a broad set of skills and experience in methods that fall under the rubric of data journalism. These include statistical analysis, but also data visualization, computer programming and data-literate reporting. So in addition to written stories, we'll have interactive graphics and features\".[538 67] FiveThirtyEight launched its ESPN-affiliated stage on March 17, 2014. As of July, it had a staff of 20 writers, editors, data visualization specialists, and others.[538 68] By March 2016, this staff had nearly doubled to 37 listed on the masthead, and 7 listed as contributors.[55] The site produced articles under 5 headings: politics, economics, science and health, (cultural) life, and sports. In addition to feature articles it produced podcasts on a range of subjects.\n\nMonthly traffic to the site grew steadily from about 2.8 million unique visitors in April 2014 to 10.7 million unique visitors in January 2016.[56]\n\n2014 U.S. elections [ edit ]\n\nOn September 3, 2014, FiveThirtyEight introduced its forecasts for each of the 36 U.S. Senate elections being contested that year.[538 69] At that time, the Republican Party was given a 64 percent chance of holding a majority of the seats in the Senate after the election. However, Silver also remarked, \"An equally important theme is the high degree of uncertainty around that outcome. A large number of states remain competitive, and Democrats could easily retain the Senate\".[538 70] About two weeks later, the forecast showed the Republican chances of holding the majority down to 55 percent.[538 71]\n\n2016 Oscars predictions [ edit ]\n\nFiveThirtyEight sought to apply its mathematical models to the Oscars, and produced internal predictions regarding the subject, predicting four out of six categories correctly.[57] The website also compiled a list of other predictions made by other people using different methods.[58]\n\n2016 U.S. elections [ edit ]\n\nPresidential primary elections [ edit ]\n\nFiveThirtyEight applied two separate models to forecast the 2016 presidential primary elections \u2013 polls-only and polls-plus models. The polls-only model relied only on polls from a particular state, while the polls-plus model was based on state polls, national polls and endorsements. For each contest, FiveThirtyEight produced probability distributions and average expected vote shares according to both models.[59]\n\nAs early as June 2015, FiveThirtyEight argued that Donald Trump \"isn't a real candidate\".[60] When Donald Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee in May 2016, New York Times media columnist Jim Rutenberg wrote that \"predictions can have consequences\" and criticized FiveThirtyEight for underestimating Trump's chances. He argued that by giving \"Mr. Trump a 2 percent chance at the nomination despite strong polls in his favor ... they also arguably sapped the journalistic will to scour his record as aggressively as those of his supposedly more serious rivals\".[61]\n\nIn a long retrospective, \"How I Acted Like a Pundit and Screwed up on Donald Trump\", published in May 2016 after Trump had become the likely nominee, Silver reviewed how he had erred in evaluating Trump's chances early in the primary campaign. Silver wrote, \"The big mistake is a curious one for a website that focuses on statistics. Unlike virtually every other forecast we publish at FiveThirtyEight \u2013 including the primary and caucus projections I just mentioned \u2013 our early estimates of Trump's chances weren't based on a statistical model. Instead, they were what we [call] 'subjective odds' \u2013 which is to say, educated guesses. In other words, we were basically acting like pundits, but attaching numbers to our estimates. And we succumbed to some of the same biases that pundits often suffer, such as not changing our minds quickly enough in the face of new evidence. Without a model as a fortification, we found ourselves rambling around the countryside like all the other pundit-barbarians, randomly setting fire to things\".[62]\n\nOn the Democratic side, FiveThirtyEight argued that Senator Bernie Sanders could \"lose everywhere else after Iowa and New Hampshire\"[63] and that the \"Democratic establishment would rush in to squash\" him if he does not.[64] Sanders went on to win 23 states in the primaries.\n\nFairness and Accuracy in Reporting, a progressive nonprofit media watch group, wrote in May 2016 that FiveThirtyEight \"sacrificed its integrity to go after Sanders\" and that they have \"at times gone beyond the realm of punditry into the realm of hackery \u2013 that is, not just treating their own opinions as though they were objective data, but spinning the data so that it conforms to their opinions.\"[65]\n\nFiveThirtyEight's predictions for each state primary, both for the Republican and the Democratic party nominations, were based on statistical analysis, not on the analyst's opinions. The core data employed were polls, which FiveThirtyEight aggregated for each state (while also considering national polls) using essentially the same method it had employed since 2008. In the 2016 primaries, the projections also took into account endorsements.[66] The website also kept track of the accumulation of national party convention delegates.[67] In a comparison of prediction success published by Bloomberg News after the primary season was completed, FiveThirtyEight's prediction success tied for the highest percentage of correct primary poll winners, at 92%; but it lagged behind PredictWise in predicting a larger set of primaries.[68] Notably, even with FiveThirtyEight's track record of correctly predicting elections that pollsters get wrong, it still missed Bernie Sanders's upset victory in the Michigan primary, for instance, regarded as \"one of the biggest upsets in modern political history\".[65]\n\nPresidential general election [ edit ]\n\nThe final prediction by FiveThirtyEight on the morning of election day (November 8, 2016) had Hillary Clinton with a 71% chance to win the 2016 United States presidential election,[69] while other major forecasters had predicted Clinton to win with at least an 85% to 99% probability.[70][71] FiveThirtyEight's model pointed to the possibility of an Electoral College-popular vote split widening in final weeks based on both Clinton's small lead in general polls, but also on Trump's improvement in swing states like Florida or Pennsylvania, mixed with Clinton's poor performance in several of those swing states in comparison with Obama's performance in 2012.[72] The main issues pointed out by the forecast model was the imbalance of Clinton's improvement in very populated states like Texas, Georgia (projected safe for Republican) and California (projected safe for Democrats);[72] mixed with her inability to attract white voters without a college degree, an increasing demographic in swing states, in addition to a potential decline in turnout from minorities.[73] In consequence, Clinton's probabilities to win the Electoral College were not improving.[72] Silver also focused on state-by-state numbers in so-called 'must-win' states like Ohio and Florida, plus a consideration of polls' margin of error in advantages of less than three points.[74]\n\nDonald Trump won the election. FiveThirtyEight projected a much higher probability of Donald Trump winning the presidency than other pollsters,[70] a projection which was criticized by Ryan Grim of the Huffington Post as \"unskewing\" too much in favor of Trump.[75] While FiveThirtyEight expressed that \"nonetheless, Clinton is probably going to win, and she could win by a big margin\", the forecaster also made points about the uncertainty of poll trackers in some cases, the considerable number of undecided voters, and the unpredictable outcome in traditional swing states.[76]\n\nIn April 2018, it was announced that FiveThirtyEight would be transferred to ABC News from ESPN, Inc., majority owned by The Walt Disney Company.[77] ABC News Live streaming channel was launched on Roku in May 2019.[78] With the reorganization creating the Walt Disney Direct-to-Consumer and International segment in March 2018, ABC News Digital and Live Streaming (websites, ABC News Live and FiveThirtyEight) was transferred to the new segment.[79]\n\n2020 U.S. elections [ edit ]\n\nRedesign of forecast [ edit ]\n\nIn early August 2020, FiveThirtyEight announced that for their 2020 general election forecast they had designed a new graphical structure. This included going with modular structure, a \"ball swarm\" design for the chart depicting each candidate's chances, and the addition of a \"forecast mascot\" named Fivey Fox.[538 72] An episode of \"Chart Chat\" discussing the design described the direction saying \"FiveThirtyEight has leaned heavily towards a cutesy and engaging approach. The Fivey Fox mascot pops up next to most charts with call-outs to more further information.\"[80]\n\nFivey Fox would also issue reminders to readers of \"the potential for extreme outcomes\" according to Jessica Hullman, in a piece written for The Hill. Hullman also said of the design that the introduction of the mascot, in conjunction with the new simplified look of the page, was \"perhaps the strongest indicator that Silver intends to emphasize uncertainty\" in his coverage of the 2020 election.[81]\n\nJasmine Mithani, visual journalist with FiveThirtyEight, said in an interview when asked about the complaints of new mascot said \"I think the biggest complaint about Fivey Fox is that some people find it infantilizing, but that wasn't our intention\" and that the motivation for including the character was to help make the forecast more of \"a teaching tool\".[82] In November 2020, Rolling Stone reported that Fivey Fox had reached over 7,000 followers on his dedicated Twitter account.[83]\n\nThe forecast favored the actual winner of 48 states, the District of Columbia, and four of the five congressional districts awarding electoral votes, only missing Florida, North Carolina, and Maine's 2nd congressional district. In those three contests the forecast had favored Biden, but they were carried by Trump. Despite correctly forecasting Biden to win nationally, they overestimated Biden's margins in some battleground states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania and underestimated Trump's margins in states such as Ohio, Iowa and Texas. Their forecast showed Democrats winning Senate races in North Carolina and Maine, which Republicans ended up winning. However, their forecast did correctly predict that the Democrats would take control of the Senate. In the House elections, their forecast favored Democrats to gain seats, yet Democrats suffered a net loss of 10 seats. The actual house results fell outside their 80% confidence interval, with Democrats winning 222 seats, lower than the confidence interval's lower bound of 225.[84]\n\n2023 cost-cutting and 2024 elections [ edit ]\n\nIn January 2023, The Daily Beast reported that the website was on the \"chopping block\" amid cost-cutting measures by ABC News, and a sale of the website was being considered. It also noted that several key employees including managing editor Micah Cohen, politics editor Sarah E. Frostenson and sports editor Sara Ziegler had left the website and their positions had not been filled.[85] An ABC spokesperson responded to the report, asserting \"no imminent decisions about [its] relationship with FiveThirtyEight.\"[86] Nonetheless, in April, Silver announced that he would be leaving the site amid widespread layoffs at ABC News, who said the website would be \"streamlined\" ahead of the 2024 election cycle; editor Chadwick Matlin was among the many laid off.[87] According to Silver, two thirds of FiveThirtyEight's staff were cut in one day.[88] Since the layoffs, FiveThirtyEight's sports and science coverage has ground to a halt, with the website mostly returning to its roots of exclusive politics coverage.[89][90]\n\nIn May 2023, ABC News hired G. Elliott Morris, a data journalist for The Economist who has often been described as a rival of Silver,[91] to head the site as editorial director of data analytics.[92] At 538, Morris developed a new election forecasting model of the 2024 election. In the leadup to Biden's withdrawal, 538 was the only professional election forecaster to give Biden majority odds of winning the 2024 election.[93] Silver criticized Morris's model, describing it as at best ignoring the polls and giving Biden positive odds merely due to his incumbency, and at worst as being \"buggy\".[93][94] The election forecast remained suspended for a month after Biden withdrew, before being replaced by a new model for Kamala Harris versus Trump that put more emphasis on polling.[95]\n\nRecognition and awards [ edit ]\n\nMascot [ edit ]\n\nFivey Fox is the mascot of FiveThirtyEight.[538 72] This is in reference to a phrase attributed to Archilochus: \"The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing\".[538 67] The name \"Fivey\" is a reference to the website's name, FiveThirtyEight. Fivey Fox is colored orange, white, and beige with comically sized black glasses and has white colored sock-like paws.\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nNotes [ edit ]\n\n^ Several national firms use the name \"Strategic Vision\"; only one has been releasing political polling results to the media. ^ FiveThirtyEight when he made some provocative discoveries of anomalies in the reported results of the 2009 Election in Iran.

        "text": "As President Joe Biden steps aside, is America ready for President Kamala Harris?\nKamala Harris has been on a yo-yo string with Democratic Party bigwigs since that cataclysmic debate performance catapulted her boss out of a sure 2024 nomination.\n\nWeeks before President Joe Biden stepped aside \u2013 and swiftly endorsed Harris to be the 2024 nominee \u2013 the vice president had emerged as the most logical replacement to top the ticket after Biden wore his frailty on national TV.\n\nAllies disseminated a logic about why Harris would be the natural successor: She could seamlessly inherit the campaign's massive warchest; her law enforcement background is best suited to prosecute the political case against Republican Donald Trump; polling shows she can win; and having been the nation's first multiracial and woman VP could galvanize a new generation of younger progressives.\n\nBut from the start, there has been a hesitancy to fully embrace the country\u2019s second-in-command, with some Democrats openly overlooking her. When a group of 24 former House Democrats sent Biden a letter last week lobbying for an open convention in August, it made no mention of Harris.\n\nThe day after Biden found himself fighting for his future in an interview with ABC News\u2019 George Stephanopoulos, Harris was asked to assure Black women, the party\u2019s backbone, that the U.S. wouldn\u2019t take a step backward in this election on issues they care about, including economic and reproductive freedom. Her message was far from reassuring.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the thing about elections,\u201d Harris told a moderator at Essence Festival of Culture in New Orleans on July 6, during a discussion entitled \u201cChief to Chief.\u201d \u201cThe people who make decisions at that level often will pay attention to either who\u2019s writing the checks or who votes. That\u2019s a cold, hard reality.\u201d\n\nRecent history:Kamala Harris on standby as Democrats plunge into panic mode\n\nThe 59-year-old Harris may seem the obvious strategic page turn for the party as well as a generational shift. Her life has been an acrobatic twist and turn, filled with personal challenges and accomplishments, including political tests in her home state of California similar to what she and the country face now.\n\nBut some wonder whether a country bitterly divided by cultural issues around race, gender and family \u2013 already seemingly poised to return Donald Trump to power \u2013 is ready for a woman of color to sit in the Oval Office.\n\n\u201cBlack women are judged more harshly by the right, by the left \u2013 by everyone,\u201d said Aimy Steele, founder and CEO of The New North Carolina Project, which is dedicated to expanding voter engagement and access in the Tar Heel State.\n\nSteele said beyond race and gender, there are other parts of Harris\u2019 life that she believes liberal allies will fail to accept or defend, including that she is a professional woman who went unmarried most of her life and put her career first without having biological children.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re kidding ourselves to really believe that we are, even on the progressive side, in a post-racial democracy or a place where these types of things don\u2019t matter,\u201d said Steele, who unsuccessfully ran for the North Carolina legislature in 2020.\n\nHalie Soifer, CEO of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, told USA TODAY that\u2019s \u201call the more reason to make sure that we stand with her. We need to stand for something.\u201d\n\n\u201cMisogyny, racism and other forms of bigotry are going to exist in this country, and yes, they may even be exacerbated by having a woman of color at the top of the ticket,\u201d said Soifer, who served as a national security adviser to Harris in the Senate.\n\n\u201cBut that is absolutely not a reason to cower or to allow the fear of that hate to impede progress in this country, and that\u2019s actually been driving Kamala Harris her whole career.\u201d\n\nOther progressives still bruised by the political backlashes from the Barack Obama years emphasize that they concur: Harris is the face of the country\u2019s future. The U.S. is projected to be majority people of color by 2045.\n\nTrump and other Republicans have long been aware of the possible ticket switch, and have derided Harris as incompetent, socially awkward and responsible for chief failures in the Biden administration. GOP officials suggest that\u2019s only the beginning.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve not really gone into depths with the record of Kamala Harris,\u201d Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., said in a Fox News Sunday appearance this month.\n\nAt the Republican National Convention last week, former Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley reminded delegates she had predicted Democrats would look to pass the baton to Harris in the middle of the 2024 contest.\n\n\u201cFor more than a year, I said a vote for Joe Biden is a vote for President Kamala Harris,\u201d she said. \"After seeing the debate, everyone knows it\u2019s true. If we have four more years of Biden or a single day of Harris, our country will be badly worse off.\"\n\nDems not fully sold on Harris either\n\nHarris\u2019 opposition is not only coming from the other side of the aisle, as Democratic skeptics worry about her viability.\n\nA former Harris staffer wrote in The Atlantic this month \u201can automatic coronation of Harris would be a grave mistake.\u201d She argued for a process to battle-test her against others vs. Trump; and said supporters are too quick to write off viability concerns as \u201cracist and sexist.\u201d\n\nA new AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research survey released this past week found 58% of Democrats believe Harris would make a good president. But the poll shows 22% of Democrats don't think she would versus 20% who said they don\u2019t know enough about her.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., warned in a Instagram live Thursday it would be incorrect to think there is a consensus among Democrats that Harris will get the support of people who wanted Biden to leave.\n\nThose individuals, she said, \u201care interested in removing the whole ticket.\u201d\n\nOther progressives, however, warn that backing away from Harris could be disastrous for the party. Democratic strategist Bakari Sellers summed it up in a post on X: \u201cSkip over Kamala Harris at your own peril.\u201d\n\nA child of immigrants with a fierce, \u2018extraordinary\u2019 mother\n\nHarris was born in Oakland, Calif. in 1964 amid the Civil Rights Movement to immigrant parents \u2013 her father Donald Harris, was an economist born in Jamaica and Shyamala Gopalan, was a cancer researcher from India.\n\nIn her 2019 memoir, she briefly describes her parents\u2019 marriage falling apart when she was five, leading to divorce. She only saw her father during summers in Palo Alto when he taught at Stanford, and acknowledges she was shaped by her 5\u20191\u201d mother, whom she calls \u201cextraordinary.\u201d\n\nHer mother took a teaching job at McGill University when Harris was 12, moving her and her sister to Montreal from 1976 until she graduated from high school in 1981.\n\nIt was in Canada where Harris first developed an affinity for lawyers who broke barriers such as Thurgood Marshall, Charles Hamilton Houston, Constance Baker Motley \u2013 giants of the civil rights movement, she wrote.\n\nHarris returned to the states to attend Howard University where she flourished in the environment where \u201ceveryone was young, gifted and Black.\u201d She pledged Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., the second founded of the historic \u201cdivine nine\u201d Greek-lettered organizations among African Americans. She interned at the Federal Trade Commission; researched at the National Archives and was a tour guide at the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing.\n\nShe first entered politics as a staffer for Democratic Sen. Alan Cranston, of California, and then returned home to Oakland to U.C. Hastings College of Law and graduated in 1989.\n\nHarris revealed in her book she took the California bar exam that July and \u201cto my utter devastation, I had failed,\u201d an acknowledged setback for a self-described perfectionist. She passed in February 1990 and began work at the Alameda County District Attorney\u2019s Office.\n\nHer political star began to rise in 1994 with her relationship with Willie Brown, the legendary California politician who at the time was the statehouse speaker, married \u2013 although long separated \u2013 and 30 years older than Harris.\n\nCalifornia entrepreneur Trevor Traina, a longtime Harris friend and former U.S. ambassador to Austria, said that relationship was a politically formative one.\n\n\"Kamala\u2019s a warm person who has a lot of charm and charisma. And she is the prote\u0301ge\u0301 of Willie Brown, who is the king of charm,\u201d Traina said in an interview with USA TODAY. \u201cAnd I think she learned well from him.\u201d\n\nInfluential San Francisco Chronicle gossip columnist Herb Caen first put her name in print that March as Brown and Harris were spotted around town.\n\nTheir romance continued to raise eyebrows that November when Brown named Harris to a state medical board, along with a hefty salary. The affair ended in 1996, but the pair would be linked for decades and the subject of character assaults into the 2020 campaign.\n\nKristin Powell, principal of Black to the Future Action Fund, a national political advocacy group, said women in politics typically have their dating and sex lives dragged out in public as disqualifiers for higher office.\n\n\u201cThe threats against her, in my opinion, will be astronomically higher than the ones against Obama because she\u2019s a woman, not just a Black person, but a Black woman,\u201d she said.\n\nPowell said that same standard isn\u2019t applied to men, noting that for years Trump has been accused of having extra-martial affairs and of sexual assault (which the former president vehemently denies).\n\nBy 2000, Harris moved to City Hall and quickly set her eyes on the city\u2019s top prosecutor job, challenging incumbent Terence Hallinan in 2003. An archived radio debate from that election previewed the sharp-elbowed Harris in her first political battle focused on a backlog of 40 homicide cases.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing an erosion of the criminal justice system, an absolute neglect of cases and they\u2019re prioritizing politics over professionalism,\u201d Harris said in the testy segment.\n\nHarris\u2019 campaign sent out mailers featuring the ten faces of previous San Francisco DAs stretching back to 1900. All male, all white. \u201cIt\u2019s time for a change,\u201d it read in block red letters.\n\nShe has continued to underscore the importance of U.S. leadership looking like the increasingly diverse country, including earlier this month at the Essence Festival of Culture, an annual mecca for Black women.\n\n\u201cLet us always celebrate the diversity, the depth and the beauty of our culture,\u201d she said.\n\nIf the vice president were to become the first name on a Democratic ticket, political activists such as Powell believe it would be a game-changer in 2024.\n\n\u201cThere would be a lot of excitement, not just for her, but when a Black woman gets to the White House, her or someone else, it will be a lot of excitement for women in this country because we deserve to have female leadership,\u201d she said.\n\nYet, recent polling shows Harris doesn\u2019t necessarily outpace Biden in terms of Black voter enthusiasm, which may indicate she is in a weaker position than some supporters assume.\n\nMore:Biden's support among Black women leaders still strong even as others jump ship\n\nQuentin James, founder and president of Collective PAC, which is aimed at building Black political power, said the vice president\u2019s identity is a chief engine of her popularity with racially diverse constituents, but that more sophisticated minority voters have a sharper grading curve.\n\n\u201cI definitely think that representation alone is not enough,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are looking for the meat and substance, and not solely the identity.\u201d\n\nPowell concurs that excitement over a non-white, non-male candidate comes second to certain policy commitments, especially among those who\u2019ve lived through the Obama era.\n\n\u201cWe would applaud having a Black woman in the White House,\u201d Powell said. \u201cBut before we get excited about whether that's Kamala Harris, we need to understand what she\u2019s going to give us.\u201d\n\nHarris was California\u2019s top cop\n\nA decade before being elevated to the vice presidency, Harris demonstrated an uncanny ability to beat the political odds in a political landscape that, much like today\u2019s national terrain, was dominated by aging white men.\n\nTraina said more than any other time period, he believes Harris\u2019 time as San Francisco\u2019s district attorney is an instructive window into her leadership. He said the city is cosmopolitan and international, but also notoriously left-leaning ranging from mainstream Democrats to socialists.\n\n\u201cThere's a tension between the center left and the far left, which I think mirrors the national scene right now for the Democratic Party,\u201d Traina said. \u201cAnd you have politicians who need to be elected and who need to be able to speak to the center, who understand how to navigate that environment, and Kamala is one of those people.\u201d\n\nShe took aim at the California Attorney General\u2019s office in 2010 after the incumbent, Democrat Jerry Brown, ran for governor to replace term-limited Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger. It was up to Harris to retain the seat for the Democrats, and that election season was an extraordinary one as well. It would become the nationwide sweep known as the \u201cred wave.\u201d\n\nPolitical attacks on Harris included her decision as San Francisco DA to not seek the death penalty for a gang member who shot and killed a police officer.\n\nOn Election Day in 2010, the red wave broke. Republicans regained control of the U.S. House and reclaimed governor\u2019s seats and statehouses nationwide. In the Harris-Cooley race, however, the vote turned out to be one of the closest in California history. Ballot counting took more than three weeks.\n\nAce Smith, Harris\u2019 political consultant at the time, recalls how the San Francisco Chronicle initially declared Cooley the victor.\n\nIt was a \u201cDewey defeats Truman\u201d moment. In the end, Cooley had to concede.\n\nAuthor Dan Morain, a Harris biographer, points to the win as a formative episode, where national politicians took notice of the upstart from California. The red wave, he said, \u201cstopped at the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada.\u201d\n\nSmith called Harris a \u201csupremely talented, charismatic person\u201d who attracted voters despite being outspent. In an oral history with Capitol Weekly last year, he suggested the race turned on a debate stage where Cooley defended taking both a pension and a salary after retiring.\n\nHarris\u2019 tenure as California attorney general drew accolades from Obama, who cast her as a \u201cbrilliant\u201d and \u201cdedicated\u201d campaigner.\n\n\u201c(S)he is tough, and she is exactly what you\u2019d want in anybody who is administering the law, and making sure that everybody is getting a fair shake,\" Obama said at a 2013 fundraiser that is best remembered for the president\u2019s commentary on her attractiveness. (He quickly apologized.)\n\nAfter becoming attorney general, it was clear to many observers Harris was aiming for even higher office, taking cautious positions on hot-button issues \u2013 or no position at all.\n\nThat would become the basis of Morain\u2019s book, \u201cKamala\u2019s Way,\u201d about her ascent to the U.S. Senate and ultimately the vice presidency.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about her way of operating, and it\u2019s her path to getting to where she is,\u201d Morain said. \u201cShe can be very tough, she can be empathetic, she can be cautious, she can be unsure of herself, but she\u2019s very smart and quick on her feet.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s in this period that a friend introduced Harris to an entertainment lawyer in L.A. who would become her husband. Doug Emhoff would become the first second gentleman and first Jewish spouse of a president or vice president. After they wed in 2014, Emhoff\u2019s children Cole and Ella didn\u2019t want to call Harris a stepmom and coined the phrase: \u201cMomala.\u201d\n\nBy January 2015 a new lane had opened. Longtime Sen. Barbara Boxer announced she would not seek reelection in 2016. That left two of Smith\u2019s clients, Harris and then-California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, to hash out their political futures \u2013 which Smith has said was less dramatic than some have reported.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s stuff of legends and myths, but not true,\u201d Smith said in 2023. \u201cAnd at the end of the day, (Newsom) wanted to be governor more than he wanted to be senator. She wanted to be senator\u2026 The good news was it was folks who knew each other well.\u201d\n\nIn California\u2019s primary system, where the top two vote-getters advance, Harris emerged as the winner to run against fellow Democrat Loretta Sanchez, an almost 10-year veteran of the House of Representatives. She sailed to a more than 20-point victory over Sanchez in the general election in 2016, with the support of Obama and his vice president \u2013 Joe Biden.\n\nA combative prosecutor on Capitol Hill\n\nHarris became only the second Black woman to serve in the Senate in history following Illinois\u2019s Carol Moseley Braun, a victory that came amid a new kind of red wave: That same night, Trump defeated Hillary Clinton.\n\nHarris arrived at the Senate primed for the conflict. Her maiden speech on the Senate floor laced into Trump\u2019s nominee for education secretary and future Cabinet member Betsy DeVos.\n\nShe landed initial appointments to the Homeland Security and Intelligence committees, in addition to the Environment and Budget panels. A year into office, Harris\u2019 legal background helped her secure a spot on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which gave her a platform to grill Trump\u2019s judicial nominees.\n\nShe leaned into questions about special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia and pressed future Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh on abortion rights.\n\n\u201cCan you think of any laws that give government the power to make decisions about the male body?\u201d she asked Kavanaugh during the exchange.\n\nKavanaugh replied, \u201cI\u2019m not thinking of any right now, senator.\u201d\n\nThe clip went viral.\n\nSoifer, the former national security adviser, said those examples in the Senate underscore how Harris is uniquely positioned to be the Democratic nominee. Harris would be the most stark contrast with Trump at a time when women\u2019s rights, particularly reproductive healthcare, is at the forefront.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a force to be reckoned with, and I would love to see her debate Donald Trump,\u201d Soifer said. \u201cShe would eviscerate him.\u201d\n\nSeveral months after the Kavanaugh hearings, Harris announced she\u2019d run for president. She had served in the Senate just two years. She had not yet written a single piece of legislation that became law.\n\nBut she also had never lost an election.\n\nSizzling debate performance, then presidential hopes implode\n\nNaysayers are quick to point at Harris\u2019 failed 2020 presidential bid, which closed up shop before the first ballots were even cast.\n\nHarris declared in her birthplace of Oakland, near the hospital where she was born; the University of California, Berkeley, where her parents met; and a stone\u2019s throw from where she had worked as a young district attorney.\n\nShe was running to protect America\u2019s democratic institutions and healthcare access for all, she said, to check the white supremacists who descended on Charlottesville and to keep children out of cages at the southern border.\n\n\u201cPeople in power are trying to convince us that the villain in our American story is each other. But that is not our story. That is not who we are. That\u2019s not our America,\u201d she said as she stood in front of Oakland City Hall.\n\nHarris caught the country\u2019s attention when she went after Biden at the first Democratic debate that summer. She criticized the former vice president for comments he\u2019d made about pro-segregationists he served with and shared with him what it was like to be bused to an all-white school.\n\n\u201cYou also worked with them to oppose busing,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd, you know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me.\u201d\n\nHarris shot up in the rankings: she was in a tight race for second place.\n\nBut the momentum did not hold. Less than three months after the breakout moment, Harris\u2019 campaign was sinking. She was down in the polls, and running out of cash. She\u2019d burned through a $35 million war chest and her campaign was rife with infighting.\n\nHarris made one of the most difficult decisions of her political career. With two months to go until the Iowa Caucus, she quit the race.\n\nSmith, the political consultant who engineered Harris\u2019 2010 win in the face of the red wave, said bowing out of the presidential race in 2020 was the right call and led to her vice presidential nod, contrasted with Elizabeth Warren\u2019s bid that dragged on.\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d Smith said in 2023, \u201cthe wisest political decision you can make is actually to realize when you're not being successful and get out.\u201d\n\nThe calculus paid off: When Biden secured the nomination, thanks largely to African American voters, he chose her as his running mate.\n\nHarris\u2019 sharp debate skills served her well on Biden\u2019s ticket. As then-Vice President Mike Pence tried to interrupt her, Harris delivered one of the most memorable lines of her political career that turned into an online sensation.\n\n\u201cMr. Vice President, I\u2019m speaking,\u201d she told Pence.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a remarkable leader who inspires certainly all of those who have worked with her closely, but also now the American people, especially women and young women who look to her as someone who gives them a sense of empowerment,\u201d Soifer said. \u201cShe\u2019s a fighter.\u201d\n\nSome wonder: What has Kamala Harris done as vice president?\n\nHarris' election to vice president as the first woman, Black person and Asian American to serve in the role was met with celebration.\n\nThat enthusiasm waned over the years as Harris fumbled early assignments, which supporters claim she was unfairly saddled with in the early days of the Biden administration.\n\nThe president tasked her with addressing the \u201croot causes\u201d of mass migration to the southern border \u2013 an area she had little to no expertise on as a senator or attorney general. Harris\u2019 team had to bring in outside experts from nonprofit organizations that do work in the region to brief her.\n\nOn a trip to Guatemala that June, Harris came under heavy scrutiny for telling NBC\u2019s Lester Holt she\u2019d been to the U.S.-Mexico border. Neither she nor Biden had at that point. The White House stressed that was not her assignment \u2013 it was to work with Northern Triangle countries. Harris soon caved to political pressure. Within weeks, she visited El Paso, Texas, where she scolded Congress to \u201cstop the rhetoric and the finger pointing\u201d and pass immigration legislation.\n\nThe pandemic and the efforts the White House took to protect the president and vice president from getting COVID left Harris isolated and unable to travel frequently her first year in office. The problem was compounded as Biden and his advisers struggled with how to utilize her.\n\nThose episodes were brought up regularly during the GOP convention in Milwaukee last week as Republicans prepared for a scenario in which Harris could be the Democratic candidate.\n\n\u201cWhen Joe Biden and Kamala Harris refused to even come to Texas and see the border crisis that they created, I took the border crisis to them,\u201d Republican Gov. Greg Abbott said on the convention stage.\n\nOther Republicans, such as Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., accused the VP of enabling \u201ccriminals and rioters\u201d during the protests following the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer.\n\nBiden had served in the Senate for more than three decades before he became vice president. There was no existing schema for someone like Harris. She was a trained lawyer, who did a short stint as a senator.\n\n\u201cMost of that stuff is not transferable to the job of the vice president,\u201d said Harris\u2019 first communications director as vice president, Ashley Etienne. \u201cSo she figured out what are her strengths. And she\u2019s over indexed on them.\u201d\n\nHarris finds her footing on reproductive rights, other liberal causes\n\nIt took the leak of a Supreme Court decision reversing Roe v. Wade for Harris to cut her own path. She\u2019d worked closely with abortion rights advocates in California. She was in her element.\n\nIn a fiery speech the next day at an abortion rights gala, Harris reminded activists of her exchange with Kavanaugh.\n\n\u201cThose who attack Roe have been clear. They want to ban abortion in every state. They want to bully anyone who seeks or provides reproductive healthcare. And they want to criminalize and punish women for making these decisions,\u201d she said.\n\nJason Williams, a professor of justice studies at Montclair State University in New Jersey, said Harris\u2019 stepped-up presence in the wake of the Dobbs decision changed the perception of her role.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when we\u2019ve seen in a very public way the power that she brings to this team,\u2019\u2019 Williams said. \u201cObviously when she's talking about anything in the judicial system that\u2019s her own thing. That\u2019s what she went to school for. That\u2019s what she has worked (for) as\u2026 a prosecutor for so many years.\u201d\n\nHarris traveled the country, sounding the alarm. Democrats lost the House in the midterm elections but kept the Senate with her assistance.\n\nThe election-year victories finally offered Harris an issue area she could own. She reoriented her agenda around cultural issues such as gun rights and book bans. Her team launched a tightly controlled national college tour that was designed to amplify her message. Celebrity moderators appeared on stage with Harris as the VP fielded pre-approved questions.\n\nBiden tapped her for bigger and better opportunities to represent the U.S. at overseas summits.\n\nAfter Hamas launched a brutal, surprise attack against Israeli civilians on Oct. 7, Harris sat in on Biden\u2019s calls with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Biden then sent Harris to Dubai to discuss the governance of Gaza after the war with Middle Eastern leaders.\n\nThere she delivered a searing statement about how Israel was conducting itself in the war.\n\n\u201cThe United States is unequivocal: International humanitarian law must be respected,\u201d Harris said. \u201cToo many innocent Palestinians have been killed. Frankly, the scale of civilian suffering and the images and videos coming from Gaza are devastating.\u201d\n\nIn March, she called for an immediate cease fire \u2013 remarks that were among the most pointed at that time from a member of the Biden administration.\n\n'Already on the job:' VP role gives Harris an edge\n\nThe balance Harris would have to achieve as a presidential candidate is differentiating herself on these issues, while also taking credit for some of the administration\u2019s accomplishments, such as student debt forgiveness and job creation.\n\nShe will have to sell herself \u2013 quickly.\n\n\u201cThis would be the challenge: Can she communicate how much of a role she played in those kinds of outcomes?\u2019\u2019 said Ange-Marie Hancock, executive director of the Kirwan Institute at The Ohio State University and curator of the Kamala Harris Project, a consortium of scholars from the country studying the vice president.\n\nElaine Kamarck, a longtime Democratic National Committee member and expert on the party\u2019s rules, told a group of Democratic activists during a Friday call that Harris has two major advantages: she\u2019s already been vetted and she\u2019s already on the job.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to, likely, have some surprise,\u201d Kamarck said on the call organized by the group Delegates are Democracy. \u201cNone of the other candidates, great as they are \u2013 and some of them, I like very much, I might even like them more than the vice president \u2013 none of them have been vetted on a national stage.\u201d\n\nAs a former prosecutor, many believe Harris also would not be intimidated by Trump, which could come with its own backlash.\n\n\u201cAs a woman and as a woman of color, how aggressive can she be before people start having the reaction that she\u2019s too aggressive,\u2019\u2019 said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University. \u201cIs that trope of the angry Black woman going to be thrown at her?\u201d\n\nWhile racist and sexist attacks aren\u2019t new, Walsh is among those who expect them to ratchet up if Harris runs for president, alongside persistent questioning about ability and qualifications.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a walk in the park,\u2019\u2019 Walsh said. \u201cWe are not post-racism. We are not post-sexism. We\u2019re still there.\u201d",

        "text": "Will Joe Biden quit US presidential race? What happens next if he does\nWill Joe Biden drop out of the US Presidential race? Will a fresh candidate help Democrats regain the US presidency? Reports claimed on Friday that the incumbent US President is expected to make a significant announcement on his re-election bid and may step down as the Democratic nominee as early as this weekend. There has been no official confirmation of this.\n\nOn Tuesday, Biden created a flutter by saying that he could quit the presidential race if doctors found he had a medical condition. Biden, 81, has tested positive for COVID-19 earlier this week.\n\nAmid the growing Democrat revolt, campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on Friday that President Biden is \u201cabsolutely\u201d staying in the presidential race.\n\nEarlier, Biden said in a written statement from the Delaware beach home where he is recovering from COVID, \u201cThe stakes are high, and the choice is clear. Together, we will win.\"\n\nBut can Joe Biden drop out of the US presidential race? Yes, if Joe Biden willingly withdrew from the race. While this seems unlikely, a few elected Democrats have publicly urged him to end his reelection- bid.\n\nAccording to the Washington Times, former US President Barack Obama told allies that Biden's path to victory has greatly diminished. The report emerged after former US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was learned to have Joe Biden in a private conversation that he could not defeat Republican candidate Donald Trump.\n\nWhat happens if Joe Biden ends his reelection bid? If Biden does step down as the Democratic Party's presidential candidate, the move would set the stage for selecting a new candidate and will likely \"turn into free-for-all\" contest.\n\nThis means, there would be an open convention, where Democrats would suggest potential nominees. They may also continue voting until one receives the majority of delegate votes, BBC reported.\n\nThis might either lead to a contest among Democrats or Biden may get the final say in who replaces him.\n\nNotably, Joe Biden has not been officially nominated as the Democratic candidate for US Presidential polls, providing a crucial window for change, said Rishi Kumar, who describes himself as a \"Biden Delegate\" on X.\n\nWhat's the process for choosing new presidential candidate? According to the report, the party's nominee will then be officially chosen at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago, which will take place from August 19 to 22.\n\nBut before the Democratic National Convention happens, over 4,000 \"pledged\" delegates will vote for their presidential nominee in a virtual roll call in early August. So if Biden ends his reelection bid before voting begins, those delegates could cast their ballots for a new candidate.\n\nNomination of a new candidate could take multiple voting rounds and strategic negotiations. The Democratic National Convention regulations state that if no candidate won a majority on that first ballot, more than 700 \"superdelegates\" are then allowed to vote.\n\n\"Balloting will continue until a nominee is selected...Eligible delegates may vote for the candidate of their choice whether or not the name of such candidate was placed in nomination,\" the ruled say. It may take several rounds of voting for one candidate to secure a majority.\n\nCan Biden be forced to end re-election bid? This is extremely rare. Realistically, at this stage in the campaign cycle, the only way Joe Biden can be replaced is if he agrees to drop out voluntarily or if he dies or suffers a \"disability\", CNBC reported.\n\nHowever, the 2024 Democratic National Convention regulations may use a loophole that could, in theory, make it possible to push Biden out. A rule says, \u201cAll delegates to the National Convention pledged to a presidential candidate shall in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them.\u201d\n\nAlso Read | Joe Biden vacillating on presidential run after testing Covid positive?\n\nExperts told the BBC that they doubt there would be a revolt among Democratic party delegates. However, it's known that the Democratic National Convention can alter party rules at any point.\n\nMeanwhile, CNBC reported that realistically, the only way to replace Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket at this stage in the campaign cycle is if he agrees to drop out voluntarily or if he dies or suffers a \"disability.\"\n\nWho can replace Joe Biden? Experts view Vice President Kamala Harris as the likeliest choice to replace Joe Biden as several senior Democratic leaders suggest that he leave the race following his disastrous debate performance, a failed assassination attempt on his rival Donald Trump, his poor health, and falling poll numbers, according to media reports.\n\n\"The vice president is the logical choice, obviously,\" said Meena Bose, director of the Peter S. Kalikow Center for the Study of the American Presidency at Hofstra University, was quoted by CNBC as saying.\n\nAlso Read | Republicans step up attacks on Kamala Harris\n\nOther high-profile Democrats, such as California Governor Gavin Newsom or Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, are seen as potentially stronger alternatives to Harris.",

        "text": "Joe Biden drops out of election, upending race for White House\nBiden ends re-election bid, upending White House race\n\nWatch: Biden\u2019s disastrous few weeks... in 90 seconds\n\nUS President Joe Biden has ended his re-election campaign and endorsed Vice-President Kamala Harris to succeed him as the Democratic candidate, in an extraordinary decision that upends an already dramatic race for the White House. Mr Biden, 81, said in a Sunday written statement that it was the \"greatest honour\" to serve but his withdrawal was \"in the best interest of my party and the country\". The announcement caps a tumultuous period in US politics, which began with his sometimes incoherent debate performance against Donald Trump on 27 June. Mr Biden says he will remain president until January. Ms Harris, 59, said that she was \"honoured\" to be endorsed, adding she would \"earn and win this nomination\" and unite the country against Trump. \"We have 107 days until election day,\" she said. \"Together, we will fight. And together, we will win.\" While Ms Harris has been picking up endorsements from many big figures in the party, she is yet to be officially nominated, and that may not happen until the Democratic National Convention in August. A resurgent Trump meanwhile has pulled ahead in polling and was confirmed as Republican nominee at the party's convention in Milwaukee this week, five days after surviving an assassination attempt. In the wake of Mr Biden's decision, he declared the president \"was not fit to run... and is certainly not fit to serve\". Other senior Republicans joined him in their criticism, and called on Mr Biden to leave the White House immediately, not just the Democratic candidacy. LIVE UPDATES: Joe Biden withdraws from US presidential race\n\nPotential Harris rivals fall in line\n\nSources told the BBC that even senior White House staff and campaign officials were told of Mr Biden's decision only moments before the statement was released on Sunday afternoon, although the president had spoken to Ms Harris and a handful of others beforehand. Dozens of senior Democrats and grandees including former president Barack Obama, Senate leader Chuck Schumer and former House speaker Nancy Pelosi immediately praised the decision and lauded Mr Biden's accomplishments in office. Former president Bill Clinton and 2016 Democratic candidate for president Hillary Clinton said they backed Kamala Harris as the party's candidate for November's vote, saying they would \"fight with everything we've got to elect her\". While Mr Obama stated that he had \"extraordinary confidence\" that an \"outstanding nominee emerges\", he did not explicitly back Ms Harris or any other candidate. Ms Pelosi has not commented. Peter Welch, the first Democratic senator to call on Biden to drop his re-election run, called for an \"open process\" to nominate Harris. But there are already signs that many in the party will unify behind her, including from high-profile politicians who had been touted as potential rivals for the nomination in the event Mr Biden stepped aside. California Governor Gavin Newsom, who is believed to have presidential ambitions, praised Mr Biden as \"selfless\" and said he backed the \"fearless\" and \"tenacious\" Ms Harris to face Trump. Josh Shapiro, the Pennsylvania governor, said he would do \"everything I can to help elect Kamala Harris as the 47th President of the United States\". Pete Buttigieg, the current transport secretary and a former presidential contender, said Mr Biden was \"one of the most consequential presidents in American history\", adding he would do \"all that I can to help elect Kamala Harris the next President.\" Gretchen Whitmer, the governor of Michigan, stated that her job \"will remain the same... doing everything I can to elect Democrats and stop Donald Trump.\" The Democratic National Committee meanwhile filed to amend the names of its fundraising committees to the Harris Victory Fund and Harris Action Fund. Two major Democratic donors - LinkedIn co-funder Reid Hoffman and investor Alexander Soros - publicly endorsed Harris. And within an hour of Mr Biden's announcement, the pro-Trump super-PAC campaign fund Make America Great Again posted an advert attacking Ms Harris, claiming \"she covered up Joe's obvious mental decline\". Trump added: \"Whoever the Left puts up now will just be more of the same.\"\n\nGetty Images Biden and Trump at the 27 June debate\n\nWeeks of intense scrutiny",

        "text": "Joe Biden pulls out of US presidential election race\nThe president has dropped his 2024 bid after weeks of pressure following a disastrous debate performance.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAfter weeks of pressure to reconsider his re-election campaign, US President Joe Biden has announced he is withdrawing as a candidate.\n\nIn a letter on his social media account on X Sunday, Biden said the decision \"is in the best interest of my party and the country\".\n\nBiden made clear he will serve out the remainder of his term, which expires in January 2025, and immediately endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n\"My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President,\" he wrote. \"And it\u2019s been the best decision I\u2019ve made. Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats \u2014 it\u2019s time to come together and beat Trump. Let\u2019s do this.\"\n\nOther names have been mentioned as potential replacements for Biden atop the Democratic ticket, but any prospective candidate would have to provide a clear rationale for a challenge against a black woman who would be the US's first female president.\n\nDonald Trump reacted to the news with a message on his bespoke social media platform, Truth Social, in which he said the \"crooked\" Biden \"was not fit to run for president, and is certainly not fit to serve - and never was!\"\n\n\"We will suffer greatly because of his presidency, but we will remedy the damage he has done very quickly,\" Trump wrote. \"MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"\n\nThe end of an era\n\nDemands for the 81-year-old Biden to drop out surged after a televised debate with Trump on 27 June in which the president appeared physically and cognitively exhausted.\n\nHe struggled to rebut his opponent's often false claims, gave rambling answers of his own, and at times stared blankly into space.\n\nAfter the on-air debacle, Biden's allies briefed the media that he had been suffering from a cold, and he delivered a higher-energy speech at a campaign rally to regain the initiative.\n\nHowever, in subsequent interviews and public appearances meant to reassure voters and his own party that he was fit to stand, Biden frequently appeared tired.\n\nAs a result, more and more prominent Democrats began either declining to speculate on his future or explicitly calling for him to stand aside, even as others insisted they were behind him.\n\nA particularly dire moment came at a Washington summit marking the 75th anniversary of NATO. While Biden proved able to hold an extended press conference in which he held forth on a range of complex policy areas, he also referred to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as \"President Putin\" and his own vice president, Kamala Harris, as \"Vice President Trump\".\n\nAs it became clear that his effort to stem the tide was not succeeding, some of the party's most senior figures \u2014 including former House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi \u2014 stopped short of calling on him to step down but began offering more equivocal answers the media when asked what he should do.\n\nA major intervention came from George Clooney, one of the Democrats' biggest donors, who wrote in the New York Times that \"the one battle (Biden) cannot win is the fight against time\".\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"It\u2019s devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe \u201cbig F-ing deal\u201d Biden of 2010. He wasn\u2019t even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nOver the edge\n\nEven the attempted assassination of Donald Trump before the Republican convention did not dislodge the Biden story from the news cycle or stop the slow but steady drip of Democrats calling on him to drop out.\n\nMidway through the convention where Trump accepted the nomination, it was announced that Biden had been diagnosed with COVID-19, forcing him to go to his home in Delaware to recover.\n\nShortly after that news broke, Black Entertainment Television broadcast a pre-recorded interview in which the president appeared strikingly unwell and struggled to remember the name of his defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, instead referring to him as \"the black guy\".\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWith the Republican convention over, the Democratic Party's central machine appeared to be moving ahead with a plan to have Biden's nomination confirmed via a virtual roll call vote in advance of their own party's gathering in Chicago in September, thus forcing delegates to cast their votes for him as soon as possible.\n\nBut before that plan could be put into action, Biden announced he was dropping out.\n\nWhat now?\n\nIt has not yet been announced precisely what will happen at the Democratic convention or how Biden's successor as nominee will be chosen.\n\nThe obvious path is for the party to nominate VP Harris, putting her in line to be the US's first woman president. She has made more and more appearances on the campaign trail in recent months, and her polling numbers relative to Biden and Trump have improved of late.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOther popular and well-known Democrats have also been suggested as potential nominees, among them California Governor Gavin Newsom and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nBut after several painful weeks spent pressuring Biden to drop out, it is not yet clear if anyone in the party will challenge Harris and risk another internal conflict.",

Fifty-six years ago, President Lyndon B Johnson announced he was giving up his bid for re-election on 31 March 31 1968.\n\nJohnson was finishing a White House address about the Vietnam War when he stunned the country with these words:\n\n\u201cWith America's sons in the fields far away, with America's future under challenge right here at home, with our hopes and the world's hopes for peace in the balance every day, I do not believe that I should devote an hour or a day of my time to any personal partisan causes or to any duties other than the awesome duties of this office - the presidency of your country.\n\n\"Accordingly, I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president.\"\n\nHis vice-president, Hubert Humphrey, gained support of the delegates at the party\u2019s Chicago convention that August, and then lost to Republican Richard Nixon in the November election.\n\nHarry S Truman also dropped out of a second-term campaign in 1952 after losing the New Hampshire primary while suffering low popularity during the Korean War.",

        "text": "Biden drops out of 2024 race after disastrous debate inflamed age concerns. VP Harris gets his nod\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 race for the White House on Sunday, ending his bid for reelection after a disastrous debate with Donald Trump that raised doubts about the incumbent\u2019s fitness for office. The unprecedented announcement, delivered less than four months before the election, immediately upended a campaign that both political parties view as the most consequential in generations.\n\nThe president \u2014 intent on serving out the remainder of his term in office \u2014 quickly endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to take on Trump and encouraged his party to unite behind her, making her the party\u2019s instant favorite for the nomination at its August convention in Chicago.\n\nThe announcement is the latest jolt to a tumultuous campaign for the White House, coming a week after the attempted assassination of Trump at a Pennsylvania rally.\n\nA party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee has never stepped out of the race so close to the election. President Lyndon Johnson, besieged by the Vietnam War, announced in March 1968 that he would not seek another term after just a single state\u2019s primary. Biden\u2019s July decision comes after more than 14 million Democrats cast votes supporting him through the primary process.\n\nHarris, in a statement, praised Biden\u2019s \u201cselfless and patriotic act\u201d and said she intends to \u201cearn and win\u201d her party\u2019s nomination.\n\n\u201cI will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party \u2014 and unite our nation \u2014 to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda,\u201d she said.\n\nBiden\u2019s decision to bow out came after escalating pressure from his Democratic allies to step aside following the June 27 debate, in which the 81-year-old president trailed off, often gave nonsensical answers and failed to call out the former president\u2019s many falsehoods.\n\n\u201cIt has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,\u201d Biden wrote in a letter posted Sunday to his X account.\n\nNearly 30 minutes after he delivered the news that he was folding his campaign, Biden threw his support behind Harris.\n\n\u201cToday I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year,\u201d he said in another post on X. \u201cDemocrats \u2014 it\u2019s time to come together and beat Trump.\u201d\n\nHarris faces a staggering political to-do list in the coming days: securing the votes of delegates to claim her party\u2019s nomination, picking a running mate, and pivoting a massive political operation that had been built to reelect Biden to boost her candidacy instead. Harris, if elected, would be the first woman and the first person of South Asian descent to be president.\n\nThere were early signs that the party was moving to coalesce around Harris, who scored the endorsements of the Congressional Black Caucus and former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton even before she had commented on Biden\u2019s decision to quit the race. But notably, former President Barack Obama held off, pledging support behind the eventual party nominee.\n\n\u201cWe are honored to join the President in endorsing Vice President Harris and will do whatever we can to support her,\u201d the Clintons said in a statement.\n\nBut Obama, who had privately shared doubts about Biden\u2019s reelection chances, stopped short of endorsing Harris even as he praised Biden for his decision to leave the race.\n\n\u201cI have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nBiden\u2019s decision came as he has been isolating at his Delaware beach house after being diagnosed with COVID-19 last week, huddling with a shrinking circle of close confidants and family members about his political future. Biden said he would address the nation later this week to provide \u201cdetail\u201d about his decision.\n\nHarris found out about Biden\u2019s plans on Sunday morning and senior campaign and White House staff were notified just minutes before the letter went out, according to people familiar with the matter who commented on the private discussions on condition of anonymity. Biden had been reflecting on his future for the past couple days and the decision was closely held.\n\nNow, Democrats have to urgently try to bring coherence to the nominating process in a matter of weeks and convince voters in a stunningly short amount of time that their nominee can handle the job and beat Trump. And for his part, Trump must shift his focus to a new opponent after years of training his attention on Biden.\n\nThe decision marks a swift and stunning end to Biden\u2019s 52 years in electoral politics, as donors, lawmakers and even aides expressed to him their doubts that he could convince voters that he could plausibly handle the job for another four years.\n\nBiden won the vast majority of delegates and every nominating contest but one, which would have made his nomination a formality. Now that he has dropped out, those delegates will be free to support another candidate.\n\nHarris, 59, appeared to be the natural successor, in large part because she is the only candidate who can directly tap into the Biden campaign\u2019s war chest, according to federal campaign finance rules.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign formally changed its name to Harris for President, reflecting that she is inheriting his political operation \u2014 a sign of the advantage she has in the race for the Democratic nomination. Democratic groups, including the Democratic National Committee, also filed paperwork changing the names of their joint fundraising committees to reflect Harris\u2019 candidacy.\n\nThe Democratic National Convention is scheduled to be held Aug. 19-22 in Chicago, but the party had announced it would hold a virtual roll call to formally nominate Biden before in-person proceedings begin.\n\nIt remained to be seen whether other candidates would challenge Harris for the nomination. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who had been discussed as a possible replacement for Biden last year, and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who challenged both Biden and Harris for the Democratic nomination in 2020, threw their support behind her Sunday.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee\u2019s chair, Jaime Harrison, said in a statement that the party would \u201cundertake a transparent and orderly process\u201d to select \u201ca candidate who can defeat Donald Trump in November.\u201d\n\nWest Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, who left the Democratic Party earlier this year to become an independent, is considering re-registering as a Democrat to vie for the nomination against the vice president, according to Jonathan Kott, a longtime adviser to Manchin.\n\nHarris was spending Sunday afternoon calling Democratic elected officials and delegates as she works to lock up the nomination.\n\nHarris received her first delegates for the Democratic presidential nomination on Sunday. The Tennessee Democratic Party posted on X that its delegation voted during a meeting Sunday to back Harris after Biden\u2019s departure from the campaign.\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly \u2014 each from a swing state and mentioned as a possible running mate for Harris \u2014 also endorsed Harris Sunday evening.\n\nTrump reacted to the news in a post on his Truth Social site, in which he said Biden \u201cwas not fit to run for President, and is certainly not fit to serve.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will suffer greatly because of his presidency, but we will remedy the damage he has done very quickly,\u201d he added. \u201cMAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\u201d\n\nWhile Trump and his team had made their preference for facing Biden clear, his campaign had nonetheless ramped up its attacks on Harris as pressure on Biden to step down intensified.\n\nDemocratic officials, including many who were behind the effort to push Biden from the race, quickly released statements praising Biden\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cHis decision of course was not easy, but he once again put his country, his party, and our future first,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. \u201cJoe, today shows you are a true patriot and great American.\u201d\n\nHouse Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York praised Biden as \u201cone of the most accomplished and consequential leaders in American history.\u201d\n\nRepublican House Speaker Mike Johnson said Biden should immediately resign if he is not fit enough to run for office. In a statement, Johnson said, \u201cNovember 5 cannot arrive soon enough.\u201d\n\nIn addition to his planned address to the country, Biden still intends to host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House this week, according to a person familiar with the president\u2019s schedule who was not authorized to comment publicly.\n\nThe exact timing of the meeting is still not set in stone as Biden continues to recover from COVID. Netanyahu is scheduled Wednesday to deliver an address to Congress and he is also expected to meet with Harris while in Washington.\n\nIn 2020, Biden pitched himself as a transitional figure who wanted to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders. But once he secured the job he spent decades struggling to attain, he was reluctant to part with it.\n\nBiden was once asked whether any other Democrats could beat Trump.\n\n\u201cProbably 50 of them,\u201d Biden replied. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not the only one who can defeat him, but I will defeat him.\u201d\n\nBiden is already the country\u2019s oldest president and had insisted repeatedly that he was up for the challenge of another campaign and another term, telling voters all they had to was \u201cwatch me.\u201d\n\nAnd watch him they did. His poor debate performance prompted a cascade of anxiety from Democrats and donors who said publicly what some had said privately for months, that they did not think he was up to the job for four more years.\n\nConcerns over Biden\u2019s age have dogged him since he announced he was running for reelection, though Trump is just three years younger at 78. Most Americans view the president as too old for a second term, according to an August 2023 poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. A majority also doubt his mental capability to be president, though that is also a weakness for Trump.\n\nBiden often remarked that he was not as young as he used to be, doesn\u2019t walk as easily or speak as smoothly, but that he had wisdom and decades of experience, which were worth a whole lot.\n\n\u201cI give you my word as a Biden. I would not be running again if I didn\u2019t believe with all my heart and soul I can do this job,\u201d he told supporters at a rally in North Carolina a day after the debate. \u201cBecause, quite frankly, the stakes are too high.\u201d\n\nBut voters had other problems with him, too \u2014 he has been deeply unpopular as a leader even as his administration steered the nation through recovery from a global pandemic, presided over a booming economy and passed major pieces of bipartisan legislation that will impact the nation for years to come. A majority of Americans disapprove of the way he\u2019s handling his job, and he\u2019s faced persistently low approval ratings on key issues including the economy and immigration.\n\nBiden\u2019s motivation for running was deeply intertwined with Trump. He had retired from public service following eight years serving as vice president under Obama and the death of his son Beau but decided to run after Trump\u2019s comments following a \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, when white supremacists descended on the city to protest the removal of its Confederate memorials.\n\nTrump said: \u201cYou had some very bad people in the group, but you also had people that were very fine people on both sides. On both sides.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s wife, first lady Jill Biden, responded to the president\u2019s announcement by reposting Biden\u2019s letter announcing his decision and adding red heart emojis.\n\nGranddaughter Naomi Biden Neal said on social media, \u201cI\u2019m nothing but proud of my Pop.\u201d She said he has served the country \u201cwith every bit of his soul and with unmatched distinction\u201d and \u201cour world is better today in so many ways thanks to him.\u201d\n\n___\n\nSuperville reported from Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. Associated Press writer Jill Colvin in New York and Aamer Madhani in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n\u2014\n\nFollow the AP\u2019s coverage of the 2024 election at https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024.",

        "text": "US elections 2024: Biden drops out of presidential race amid pressure\nThe oldest sitting US president heeds calls to withdraw re-election bid, thrusting the high-wire White House race into an uncertain territory.\n\nUnited States President Joe Biden has heeded calls to withdraw his re-election bid, thrusting this year\u2019s already high-wire race for the White House into an uncertain territory.\n\nThe announcement on Sunday by the oldest sitting president in US history came amid mounting pressure from his fellow Democrats, with more than 30 Congress members publicly pushing for his exit.\n\nIn a post on X, Biden, 81, said he will remain in his role as president and commander-in-chief until his term ends in January 2025 and will address the nation this week.\n\n\u201cIt has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,\u201d Biden wrote.\n\nHis initial statement did not include an endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris, but he followed up a few minutes later with an expression of support.\n\nHarris, 59, would become the first Black woman to run at the top of a major party ticket in the country\u2019s history.\n\nBiden\u2019s historic move \u2013 the first sitting president to give up his party\u2019s nomination for re-election since President Lyndon Johnson in March 1968 \u2013 leaves his replacement with less than four months to wage a campaign.\n\nBiden\u2019s gaffes\n\nThe Democratic backlash against Biden came after he delivered an unsteady performance at the first presidential debate of the 2024 election season as he lost his train of thought and struggled to articulate basic talking points.\n\nBiden\u2019s failure at times to complete clear sentences took the public spotlight away from Trump\u2019s performance, in which he made a string of false statements, and trained it instead on questions surrounding Biden\u2019s fitness for another term.\n\nDays later, he raised fresh concerns in an interview, shrugging off Democrats\u2019 worries and a widening gap in opinion polls, and saying he would be fine losing to Trump if he knew he would \u201cgave it my all\u201d.\n\nHis gaffes at a NATO summit \u2013 invoking Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s name when he meant Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and calling Harris \u201cVice President Trump\u201d \u2013 further stoked anxieties.\n\nOnly four days before Sunday\u2019s announcement, Biden was diagnosed with COVID-19 for a third time, forcing him to cut short a campaign trip to Las Vegas. More than one in 10 congressional Democrats had called publicly for him to quit the race.\n\nThe 46th US president\u2019s departure from the race leaves the Democratic Party in an unprecedented situation, with only a month until the Democratic National Convention and less than four months until the November 5 election.\n\nIt was unclear whether other senior Democrats would challenge Harris for the party\u2019s nomination \u2013 she was widely seen as the pick for many party officials \u2013 or whether the party itself would choose to open the field for nominations.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Mike Hanna, reporting from Washington, DC, said Biden had been under a lot of pressure recently.\n\n\u201cIt is very difficult to say what made him make the decision now,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat we do know is that he has been repeatedly insistent that he would not step down \u2026 So it comes as a bit of a surprise and a bit of a shock that Biden is saying he will step down after weeks of saying he won\u2019t.\u201d",

        "text": "July 21, 2024, presidential campaign news\nDonald Trump walks off stage after speaking at a campaign rally on July 20, in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n\nDonald Trump was joined by his newly minted running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, on Saturday at the former president\u2019s first campaign rally since the attempt to assassinate him last weekend.\n\nThe two were greeted by an amped up crowd at an indoor arena in Grand Rapids, Michigan.\n\nHere\u2019s what happened:\n\nNew running mate: Vance, who fired up the crowd ahead of Trump\u2019s remarks, said, \u201cI gotta be honest, it\u2019s still a little bit weird seeing my name on those signs,\u201d referring to the Trump-Vance campaign material waving behind him in the audience.\n\nVance defended his loyalty to the US, after Vice President Kamala Harris said he \u201cwill be loyal only to Trump, not to our country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some bad news actually, Vice President Kamala Harris, she doesn\u2019t like me,\u201d Vance said in remarks about two hours before Trump took the stage. \u201cKamala Harris said something to the effect that \u2026 I have no loyalty to this country,\u201d he continued. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know, Kamala, I did serve in the United States Marine Corps and build a business. What the hell have you done other than collect a check?\u201d\n\nBefore the vice presidency, Harris was the district attorney of San Francisco, California\u2019s attorney general, and then the state\u2019s junior senator.\n\nVance later came back out to introduce Trump for a roaring crowd.\n\nOn the rally shooting: Trump, who wore a smaller, beige-colored bandage on his ear, said he \u201ctook a bullet for democracy.\u201d\n\nThe former president, who spoke for nearly two hours, thanked the staff at Butler Memorial Hospital, where he was taken minutes after the shooting at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nRep. Ronny Jackson, the former White House physician, said Saturday that Trump is \u201crecovering as expected\u201d from a gunshot wound to his ear. Investigations into the rally shooter and handling of security at the event continue.\n\nTrump noted in his first joint interview with Vance that people at his rally last weekend noticed there was someone on the roof before the assassination attempt.\n\nSupport from Musk: Trump said he spoke to tech billionaire Elon Musk before coming to the Grand Rapids rally. The former president said Musk didn\u2019t mention reporting from The Wall Street Journal that he will be committing around $45 million a month to a pro-Trump super PAC.\n\n\u201cElon endorsed me the other day, and I read, I didn\u2019t even know this, he didn\u2019t even tell me about it, but he gives me $45 million a month,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd I talked to him just a little while ago to say I was coming here, how you doing, and he didn\u2019t even mention it.\u201d\n\nAbout world leaders: Trump said Chinese President Xi Jinping and other world leaders wrote to him after the assassination attempt. He said he \u201cgot along very well with President Xi, who\u2019s a great guy,\u201d and claimed that he worked well with other world leaders, too, even though they understood during his presidency that the \u201cjig was up\u201d in terms of taking advantage of the US on a world stage.\n\nBiden campaign\u2019s response: President Joe Biden\u2019s reelection campaign blasted Trump\u2019s remarks at the rally, saying Trump is \u201cfocused only on himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s peddling the same lies, running the same campaign of revenge and retribution, touting the same failed policies, and \u2013 as usual \u2013 focused only on himself. The only unity we saw today was between Donald Trump, JD Vance, and their Project 2025 agenda,\u201d Biden campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa said in a statement.\n\nProject 2025 refers to the policy blueprint created by a conservative think tank. Democrats have latched on to some of the document\u2019s controversial right-wing proposals, while Trump has tried to distance himself from the platform, despite dozens of people from his former administration having a hand in its creation.",

        "text": "Biden endorses Kamala Harris as US presidential nominee. What happens next?\nAs the US president bows out amid concerns over his age, Democrats face the challenge of finding a new candidate for the November election.\n\nUnited States President Joe Biden\u2019s withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race has left Democrats grappling with unanswered questions about the way forward, with less than four months before election day.\n\nBiden stepped aside on Sunday after weeks of pressure from fellow Democrats following a disastrous debate performance against former President Donald Trump in June.\n\nNow, Democrats need to coalesce around a new nominee and re-energise their base if they want to defeat Trump, analysts say. Vice President Kamala Harris is an early favourite to replace Biden, especially after she received the president\u2019s endorsement. Biden also encouraged donors to contribute to Harris for her campaign.\n\nStill, Biden\u2019s decision to withdraw is not merely unusual \u2014 it is unprecedented in modern US politics. \u201cWe\u2019re in uncharted territory here,\u201d said Kyle Kondik, the managing editor for the Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball, a newsletter about elections published by the University of Virginia Center for Politics.\n\nAnd Harris could face challengers seeking the Democratic nomination in the coming days.\n\nThe new nominee will be chosen at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next month, when more than 4,000 party officials and activists, known as delegates, gather to vote.\n\nThere have been instances where parties have chosen their candidates in competitive conventions after the primaries. In fact, that happened frequently before the modern primary system was put in place in 1972, granting voters a greater say in the process.\n\nBut the Democrats\u2019 current situation is different.\n\nHaving won nearly all pledged delegates, Biden is now the first presumptive nominee of a major party to quit the race after the primaries have concluded.\n\nThe president ran in the primaries without any serious challengers and Democratic officials stressed early on that Biden \u2013 as the incumbent \u2013 will be the likely nominee.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really think there\u2019s any good recent precedent for it. Half a century or more ago, it wasn\u2019t uncommon to go into the convention not necessarily knowing for sure who the nominee was going to be,\u201d Kondik, who spoke to Al Jazeera earlier this week, said.\n\n\u201cBut since then, we haven\u2019t had this sort of situation where somebody dominates the primary season \u2013 but then steps aside later, in advance of the convention.\u201d\n\nWith no historical precedent to follow, Democrats will have to improvise within their guidelines on how to choose their new nominee, analysts say.\n\nWhile the change comes with risks, a new candidate could galvanise Democratic voters who had previously resigned themselves to the uphill battle of taking on Trump at a time when his lead over Biden had widened across battleground states.\n\nBefore dropping out, Biden was set to face Republican nominee Trump for the second presidential election in a row.\n\nMeena Bose, a professor of political science at Hofstra University, said that while it is risky to change candidates so close to the elections, a shake-up at the top of the Democratic ticket could boost the party\u2019s chances.\n\n\u201cA late change is not ideal but may bring more optimism than no change at all or, at the very least, might potentially be helpful down the ballot, if not in the presidential race,\u201d Bose said.\n\nPresidential endorsement\n\nSoon after Biden announced his departure from the race, he endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to replace him at the top of the Democratic Party ticket.\n\nKondik said Biden\u2019s endorsement makes a big difference. The president has the support of the overwhelming majority of delegates. And while they are not bound to back Harris, Biden\u2019s backing could tip the scales in her favour. In the hours that followed Biden\u2019s announcement, a flood of leading Democrats publicly endorsed Harris \u2013 from Senator Elizabeth Warren and state leaders of the Democratic Party to governors who were seen as potential rivals for the nomination, such as California\u2019s Gavin Newsom and Pennsylvania\u2019s Josh Shapiro.\n\nThe vice president also has national name recognition and can inherit the Biden-Harris campaign infrastructure.\n\nKondik said that nominating Harris was the \u201cpath of least resistance\u201d for Democrats. Bose echoed that assessment, saying that Harris was the most \u201clogical choice\u201d to ensure a \u201cseamless transition\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere is not a lot of time for an open competition for delegate support,\u201d she told Al Jazeera.\n\nHans Noel, a professor at Georgetown University\u2019s Department of Government, also said on Friday \u2013 before Biden\u2019s announcement \u2013 that Harris was projected to take over the nomination.\n\n\u201cThe vice presidential candidate does not automatically become the presidential candidate, but I think a lot of voters would sort of expect that,\u201d Noel told Al Jazeera in an email.\n\n\u201cGiven that she\u2019s in that position, there are a lot of reasons not to go to someone else. She does have a lot of support in the party, but more importantly, nominating someone else would look like skipping over a Black woman, which would not look good for many in the party.\u201d\n\nThe rules for the Democratic National Committee state that delegates can propose a new party nominee if they obtain the signatures of 300 fellow delegates, along with a signature of confirmation from the proposed candidate. But the party will, in all likelihood, coalesce around Harris to present a united front.\n\nLingering questions\n\nThe Democratic Party now faces the anxiety-inducing question of how voters will respond to Biden\u2019s departure from the presidential race, a considerable shake-up so close to the election.\n\nUS presidential campaigns require massive investments of cash and manpower to reach people across the country. Some start as early as two years in advance. Launching a campaign from scratch will not be easy.\n\n\u201cCampaigns take huge amounts of infrastructure, money [and] messaging to get through to the voters that we know are most undecided,\u201d said Casey Burgat, the director of the legislative affairs programme at George Washington University.\n\nBurgat explained that reaching undecided voters is also labour-intensive: \u201cYou need to hit them several times. You need to have people knocking on doors. There\u2019s just a huge infrastructure to be built.\u201d\n\nWhat happens to the campaign funds Biden amassed is also a source of uncertainty. With no precedent for the current situation, questions have swirled over the fate of Biden\u2019s war chest.\n\nIn the US, after all, election spending can run into millions, if not billions, of dollars.\n\nBut Burgat noted that campaign finance restrictions are less of an issue for Harris since she is already on the ticket as Biden\u2019s vice president and has been part of his fundraising efforts.\n\nChallenges and opportunities\n\nHowever, if Biden\u2019s exit has drawbacks, it also presents opportunities. Many voters had been unenthused about the prospect of an election between Biden and Trump.\n\nBefore Biden\u2019s announcement, a recent poll from The Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 65 percent of Democrats believed he should exit the race.\n\nJust three in 10 expressed confidence that he had the mental acuity necessary to serve effectively as president.\n\nBurgat says that a new, younger candidate could have an energising effect and give the party a much-needed boost.\n\n\u201cThe most common thing we\u2019ve heard is: \u2018I can\u2019t believe these are our two options.\u2019 People have been wondering how, in this country of 350 million people, their choice has been reduced to these two very unpopular candidates,\u201d he said.\n\nDemocrats in competitive congressional districts had grown especially worried that Biden\u2019s unpopularity could stymie candidates up and down the ballot, lowering their chances in races that might otherwise be winnable.\n\nRecent polling pointed to an alarming trend in that direction. The Wall Street Journal reported that a poll by Blue Rose Research suggested that more than half of swing voters believed Democrats had been lying about Biden\u2019s mental fitness.\n\nNearly 30 percent of voters who supported Biden in 2020 felt the same way, too, according to the poll.\n\nDemocrats may fear that playing down Biden\u2019s age could tarnish their credibility with voters and do long-term damage to the party. According to Burgat, that contributed to the pressure that informed Biden\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cDemocrats will be able to say, and rightfully so, that things change when there are widespread concerns about a candidate,\u201d said Burgat. \u201cThey can make the case that this job \u2013 this election \u2013 is too important to ignore those concerns.\u201d",

        "text": "President Joe Biden drops out of 2024 presidential race\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Joe Biden announced Sunday that he will end his presidential re-election campaign, bringing an abrupt and humbling conclusion to his half-century-long political career and scrambling the race for the White House less than four months before Election Day.\n\nBiden, 81, could not reverse growing sentiment within his party that he was too frail to serve and destined to lose to Donald Trump in November. He backed Vice President Kamala Harris to replace him as the Democratic nominee.\n\n\u201cWhile it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,\u201d Biden wrote in a letter posted on X. \u201cI will speak to the Nation later this week in more detail about my decision.\u201d\n\nBiden thanked Harris for \u201cbeing an extraordinary partner\u201d in his letter and then endorsed her in a subsequent post.\n\n\u201cMy very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President,\u201d Biden posted. \u201cAnd it\u2019s been the best decision I\u2019ve made. Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year.\u201d\n\nBiden and Harris spoke multiple times Sunday ahead of the president\u2019s announcement, according to a source familiar with the campaign.\n\nIn a statement, Harris thanked Biden for \u201chis extraordinary leadership\u201d and his \u201cremarkable legacy of achievement.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am honored to have the President\u2019s endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party \u2014 and unite our nation \u2014 to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda,\u201d she said.\n\nBiden \u2014 who for weeks had insisted publicly that he planned to stay in the race \u2014 told his senior team he had changed his mind about continuing his campaign at 1:45 p.m. ET, according to a source with direct knowledge. The tweet announcing his decision was sent at 1:46 p.m.\n\nHis withdrawal caps a singular national political career, bookended by Richard Nixon\u2019s fall and Trump\u2019s rise. He mounted four presidential bids. He spent 36 years in the U.S. Senate representing tiny Delaware. He rose to the chairmanships of the powerful Judiciary and Foreign Relations committees. And he served eight years as Barack Obama\u2019s vice president.\n\n'Great public servant'\n\nReactions from politicians quickly began pouring in.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote in a post on X that Biden \u201chas been an extraordinary, history-making president \u2014 a leader who has fought hard for working people and delivered astonishing results for all Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe will go down in history as one of the most impactful and selfless presidents,\u201d said Newsom, who was one of the most prominent Biden surrogates. Newsom has been floated as a possible Democratic presidential contender, but threw his support behind Harris hours after the announcement, saying in a post on X that \"no one is better to prosecute the case against Donald Trump\u2019s dark vision and guide our country in a healthier direction than America\u2019s Vice President, @KamalaHarris.\"\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, another prominent Democrat talked about as a future national candidate, called Biden a \u201cgreat public servant\u201d in a post on X.\n\n\u201cMy job in this election will remain the same: doing everything I can to elect Democrats and stop Donald Trump, a convicted felon whose agenda of raising families\u2019 costs, banning abortion nationwide, and abusing the power of the White House to settle his own scores is completely wrong for Michigan,\u201d Whitmer wrote.\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden reposted her husband's announcement with heart emojis. \u201cDown to the last hours of the decision only he could make, she was supportive of whatever road he chose,\" said her communications director, Elizabeth Alexander.\n\nAcross the aisle, Republicans slammed the move and many called on him to resign from office, days after the completion of a Republican National Convention where speaker after speaker slammed the Biden-Harris ticket.\n\n\u201cIf Joe Biden is not fit to run for president, he is not fit to serve as President. He must resign the office immediately,\u201d said House Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\nIn a brief phone interview with NBC News, Trump reacted to Biden\u2019s decision, calling the president \u201cthe worst president in the history of the United States by far.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether he was surprised by Biden\u2019s decision, Trump said that Biden \u201cshould never have been there in the first place.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe should have stayed in his basement,\u201d Trump said.\n\nIn a fundraising email, Trump\u2019s campaign said that Biden \u201cquit the race in complete disgrace.\u201d\n\nAn unprecedented decision\n\nBiden\u2019s decision to exit the race less than a month before his party\u2019s convention and a few months before voters head to the polls is unprecedented in the modern political era. The last sitting president to abandon a re-election bid was Lyndon Johnson, whose expansion of the Vietnam War in the 1960s split the Democratic Party. But Johnson\u2019s announcement came in March 1968 \u2014 eight months before that election.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in uncharted waters,\u201d said Barbara Perry, a presidential studies professor at the University of Virginia\u2019s Miller Center. \u201cNo president has dropped out or died this close to the convention.\u201d\n\nReplacing Biden atop the Democratic ticket is likely to set off internal Democratic tremors as ambitious officials maneuver to become his successor. Factions have already formed around Harris, Whitmer and Newsom.\n\nHarris, who at 59 is 22 years younger than Biden, would seem to be the heir apparent. She broke a barrier as the first female vice president. A woman of color, she enjoys strong support among African Americans, a loyal piece of the Democratic coalition. Overall, though, Harris\u2019 approval rating stood at only 32% in an NBC News poll released earlier this month.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no one you can name right now who is an obvious substitute,\u201d Perry said. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes this so uncertain and chaotic.\u201d\n\nUnlike Republican delegates, who are bound to their candidate, Democratic delegates aren\u2019t, so they are free to do what they want at the convention. Biden could have some influence over the delegates, but they could vote for a different candidate than his chosen pick, pending any rule changes at the convention meant to address this unprecedented situation. The rules currently say that the delegates simply have to \u201cin all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them.\u201d\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison said in a statement: \u201cIn the coming days, the Party will undertake a transparent and orderly process to move forward as a united Democratic Party with a candidate who can defeat Donald Trump in November. This process will be governed by established rules and procedures of the Party. Our delegates are prepared to take seriously their responsibility in swiftly delivering a candidate to the American people.\u201d\n\nThe mechanics of putting a new name on ballots also gives rise to myriad legal questions. Republicans could work to throw obstacles in the nominee\u2019s path by mounting legal challenges aimed at keeping that person off the ballot.\n\nJohnson, the House speaker, said in an interview on CNN Sunday before Biden's announcement that \u201cI think they have got legal hurdles in some of these states, and it\u2019ll be litigated.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have got a real problem,\u201d he added.\n\nSupport for Harris\n\nDemocratic congressional leadership did not immediately back Harris, but many high-profile lawmakers did join Biden in rallying around the vice president, including Reps. James Clyburn of South Carolina, Jamie Raskin of Maryland, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell of California, and Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Chris Coons of Delaware, Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Mark Kelly of Arizona.\n\nCongressional Black Caucus chairman Rep. Steven Horsford, D-Nev., and Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., the chair of the group\u2019s PAC, said they join Biden in \u201cfully supporting\u201d Harris to be the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\n\u201cI know one thing, I will only work for @KamalaHarris!\u201d Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, said in a post on X shortly before Biden endorsed Harris. \u201cIf it\u2019s anyone OTHER than her, enjoy campaign season.\u201d\n\nSen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, said in a statement that \u201cI look forward to doing everything in my power to get her elected to the White House, so we can continue building on the progress of the last four years.\u201d\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who ran for president in 2020, endorsed Harris as well, saying, \"I will do all that I can to help elect her.\"\n\nFormer President Barack Obama did not immediately endorse Harris. \u201cWe will be navigating uncharted waters in the days ahead. But I have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nHarris\u2019s fledgling campaign gave Democrats an immediate jolt from small-dollar donors. ActBlue, the main Democratic online fundraising platform, reported that the groups using it raised $27.5 million in the first five hours of her campaign. (Not all of that money flowed to Harris, though it's likely that a lot of it did.)\n\nDebate spurred calls for Biden to end his run\n\nQuestions about Biden\u2019s capacities dogged him throughout his presidency, but peaked following his debate with Trump on June 27. Combined with his flagging poll numbers, his listless performance sparked a panic among his own party that he couldn\u2019t win in November.\n\nWith 51 million people watching, Biden spoke in a raspy voice and often failed to complete thoughts or deliver a cogent explanation of why voters should choose him over Trump. He later attributed his poor performance to exhaustion and a cold. He implored the country not to let one bad night overshadow his accomplishments in office.\n\nUnpersuaded, Democratic lawmakers began calling on him to step aside, a rebellion that started slowly but grew steadily in size and intensity. Thirty-seven congressional Democrats, including independent Sen. Joe Manchin, who previously was in the Democratic Party, had called on Biden to drop out of the 2024 election before he delivered his decision Sunday afternoon.\n\nThey appealed to Biden\u2019s patriotism, arguing that if he sincerely believed Trump is a threat to democracy, he needed to put his country first and stand down.\n\nBiden fought back. He held numerous calls and meetings with Democratic officials at all levels to shore up support inside the party \u2014 to no avail.\n\nLooking to blunt concerns about his acuity, he gave interviews and held press conferences to prove to voters that he could still think on his feet. But the gaffes kept coming and his poll numbers remained stagnant.\n\nIn another bit of bad fortune and timing, Biden tested positive for Covid-19 on July 17, forcing him off the campaign trail.\n\nFor Democrats, Biden\u2019s illness created an unwanted contrast. While Trump delivered a triumphal speech accepting the Republican nomination in Milwaukee on July 18, five days after surviving an assassination attempt, Biden was in self-isolation back home.\n\nTrump rebound\n\nBiden\u2019s departure is the latest in a series of jarring developments that has made the 2024 presidential race the most chaotic in living memory. Trump easily won the Republican presidential nomination despite splitting his time between the campaign trail and various courtrooms where he was a defendant in criminal and civil cases. In May, a jury in Manhattan convicted him on 34 felony counts related to hush money payments to a porn star.\n\nThen, in short order, Trump rebounded. The Supreme Court issued a much-anticipated ruling on July 1 that immunized Trump from official conduct when he was president, impeding special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s efforts to prosecute Trump for interfering in the 2020 election.\n\nTrump nearly died on July 13 as he appeared at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. A gunman lying on a roof 130 yards away fired a bullet that grazed his ear. Trump dropped to the ground in self-defense. Then, his face smeared with blood, he rose and defiantly pumped his fist, yelling \u201cFight!\u201d\n\nAnother fortuitous development came two days later, coinciding with the opening of the Republican convention in Milwaukee that certified Trump\u2019s nomination. U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon in Florida dismissed a separate case brought by Smith alleging that Trump improperly retained classified documents that he took home with him when he left the White House in 2021. Cannon, who had been appointed by Trump, ruled that Smith\u2019s appointment was illegal. Smith quickly appealed her ruling.\n\nThe rolling streak of news gave Trump a jolt of momentum, allowing Republicans to present an energized and unified front at this month\u2019s convention.\n\nBiden seldom sparked any such enthusiasm. HIs primary campaign was mostly a coronation. He faced token opposition as party leaders cleared the field, betting that having beaten Trump once before, Biden was best positioned to do it again. But poll after poll confirmed that voters harbored doubts about him, believing he was too old and infirm to serve another term.\n\nAn AP-NORC survey released July 17 found that a whopping 65% of Democrats believed Biden should exit the race.\n\nPressed by his voters, abandoned by party leaders, Biden gave in.",

        "text": "How Biden\u2019s withdrawal affects foreign policy challenges as the world watches the U.S. election\nJoe Biden\u2019s withdrawal from the U.S. presidential race injects greater uncertainty into the world at a time when Western leaders are grappling with wars in Ukraine and Gaza, a more assertive China in Asia and the rise of the far-right in Europe.\n\nDuring a five-decade career in politics, Biden developed extensive personal relationships with multiple foreign leaders that none of the potential replacements on the Democratic ticket can match. After his announcement, messages of support and gratitude for his years of service poured in from near and far.\n\nREAD MORE: What political leaders have said about Biden\u2019s decision to end his reelection bid\n\nThe scope of foreign policy challenges facing the next U.S. president makes clear how consequential what happens in Washington is for the rest of the planet. Here\u2019s a look at some of them.\n\nIsrael\n\nWith Vice President Kamala Harris being eyed as a potential replacement for Biden, Israelis on Sunday scrambled to understand what her candidacy would mean for their country as it confronts increasing global isolation over its military campaign against Hamas.\n\nIsrael\u2019s left-wing Haaretz daily newspaper ran a story scrutinizing Harris\u2019 record of support for Israel, pointing to her reputation as Biden\u2019s \u201cbad cop\u201d who has vocally admonished Israel for its offensive in Gaza. In recent months, she has gone further than Biden in calling for a cease-fire, denouncing Israel\u2019s invasion of Rafah and expressing horror over the civilian death toll in Gaza.\n\nREAD MORE: Biden and Netanyahu will still meet during Israeli prime minister\u2019s U.S. visit, source says\n\n\u201cWith Biden leaving, Israel has lost perhaps the last Zionist president,\u201d said Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli consul general in New York. \u201cA new Democratic candidate will upend the dynamic.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s staunch defense of Israel since Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack has its roots in his half-century of support for the country as a senator, vice president, then president. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant thanked Biden for his \u201cunwavering support of Israel over the years.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour steadfast backing, especially during the war, has been invaluable,\u201d Gallant wrote on X.\n\nIsraeli President Isaac Herzog praised Biden as a \u201csymbol of the unbreakable bond between our two peoples\u201d and a \u201ctrue ally of the Jewish people.\u201d There was no immediate reaction from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, an ally of former President Donald Trump whose history of cordial relations with Biden has come under strain during the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nUkraine\n\nAny Democratic candidate would likely continue Biden\u2019s legacy of staunch military support for Ukraine. But frustration with the Biden administration has grown in Ukraine and Europe over the slow pace of U.S. aid and restrictions on the use of Western weapons.\n\n\u201cMost Europeans realize that Ukraine is increasingly going to be their burden,\u201d said Sudha David-Wilp, director of the Berlin office of the German Marshall Fund, a research institute. \u201cEveryone is trying to get ready for all the possible outcomes.\u201d\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on X that he respected the \u201ctough but strong decision\u201d by Biden to drop out of the campaign, and he thanked Biden for his help \u201cin preventing (Russian President Vladimir) Putin from occupying our country.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Zelenskyy: Ukraine \u2018will always be thankful\u2019 for Biden\u2019s leadership\n\nTrump has promised to end Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine in one day if he is elected \u2014 a prospect that has raised fears in Ukraine that Russia might be allowed to keep the territory it occupies.\n\nTrump\u2019s vice presidential pick, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, is among Congress\u2019 most vocal opponents of U.S. aid for Ukraine and has further raised the stakes for Kyiv.\n\nRussia, meanwhile, dismissed the importance of the race, insisting that no matter what happened, Moscow would press on in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWe need to pay attention,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying by a pro-Russian tabloid. \u201cWe need to watch what will happen and do our own thing.\u201d\n\nChina\n\nIn recent months, both Biden and Trump have tried to show voters who can best stand up to Beijing\u2019s growing military strength and belligerence and protect U.S. businesses and workers from low-priced Chinese imports. Biden has hiked tariffs on electric vehicles from China, and Trump has promised to implement tariffs of 60 percent on all Chinese products.\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d doctrine exacerbated tensions with Beijing. But disputes with the geopolitical rival and economic colossus over wars, trade, technology and security continued into Biden\u2019s term.\n\nChina\u2019s official reaction to the U.S. presidential race has been careful. The official Xinhua news agency treated the story of Biden\u2019s decision as relatively minor. The editor of the party-run Global Times newspaper, Hu Xijin, downplayed the impact of Biden\u2019s withdrawal.\n\n\u201cWhoever becomes the presidential candidate of the Democratic Party may be the same,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cVoters are divided into two groups, Trump voters and Trump haters.\u201d\n\nIran\n\nWith Iran\u2019s proxies across the Middle East increasingly entangled in the Israel-Hamas war, the U.S. confronts a region in disarray.\n\nYemen\u2019s Iran-backed Houthis struck Tel Aviv for the first time last week, prompting retaliatory Israeli strikes inside war-torn Yemen. Simmering tensions and cross-border attacks between Lebanon\u2019s Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group and the Israeli military have raised fears of an all-out regional conflagration.\n\nHamas, which also receives support from Iran, continues to fight Israel even nine months into a war that has killed 38,000 Palestinians and displaced over 80 percent of Gaza\u2019s population.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies have accused Iran of expanding its nuclear program and enriching uranium to an unprecedented 60 percent level, near-weapons-grade levels.\n\nAfter then-President Trump in 2018 withdrew from Tehran\u2019s landmark nuclear deal with world powers, Biden said he wanted to reverse his predecessor\u2019s hawkish anti-Iran stance. But the Biden administration has maintained severe economic sanctions against Iran and overseen failed attempts to renegotiate the agreement.\n\nThe sudden death of Ebrahim Raisi \u2014 the supreme leader\u2019s hard-line protege \u2014 in a helicopter crash vaulted a new reformist to the presidency in Iran, generating new opportunities and risks. Masoud Pezeshkian has said he wants to help Iran open up to the world but has maintained a defiant tone against the U.S.\n\nEurope and NATO\n\nMany Europeans were happy to see Trump go after his years of disparaging the European Union and undermining NATO. Trump\u2019s seemingly dismissive attitude toward European allies in last month\u2019s presidential debate did nothing to assuage those concerns.\n\nBiden, on the other hand, has supported close American relations with bloc leaders.\n\nThat closeness was on stark display after Biden\u2019s decision to bow out of the race. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk called his choice \u201cprobably the most difficult one in your life.\u201d The newly installed British prime minister, Keir Starmer, said he respected Biden\u2019s \u201cdecision based on what he believes is in the best interests of the American people.\u201d\n\nWATCH: German Chancellor Scholz on NATO\u2019s future, supporting Ukraine and working with Biden\n\nThere was also an outpouring of affection from Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris, who called Biden a \u201cproud American with an Irish soul.\u201d\n\nThe question of whether NATO can maintain its momentum in supporting Ukraine and checking the ambitions of other authoritarian states hangs in the balance of this presidential election, analysts say.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to see Donald Trump as president. So there\u2019s quite a bit of relief but also quite a bit of nervousness\u201d about Biden\u2019s decision to drop out, said Jeremy Shapiro, research director of the European Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cLike many in the United States, but perhaps more so, they are really quite confused.\u201d\n\nMexico\n\nThe close relationship between Mexico and the U.S. has been marked in recent years by disagreements over trade, energy and climate change. Since President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador took power in 2018, both countries have found common ground on issue of migration \u2013 with Mexico making it more difficult for migrants to cross its country to the U.S. border and the U.S. not pressing on other issues.\n\nThe L\u00f3pez Obrador administration kept that policy while Trump was president and continued it into Biden\u2019s term.\n\nOn Friday, Mexico\u2019s president called Trump \u201ca friend\u201d and said he would write to him to warn him against pledging to close the border or blaming migrants for bringing drugs into the United States.\n\n\u201cI am going to prove to him that migrants don\u2019t carry drugs to the United States,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cclosing the border won\u2019t solve anything, and anyway, it can\u2019t be done.\u201d\n\nAssociated Press writers Jill Lawless in London, Daria Litvinova in Talinn, Estonia, and Josh Goodman in Miami contributed to this report.\n\nFind more coverage",

        "text": "The 24 days that turned the 2024 presidential election upside down\nA look at Biden's path to stepping down from the 2024 election.\n\nIn just 24 days, the 2024 presidential election has been turned upside down.\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Sunday dropped out of the race, just over three weeks after his widely criticized poor showing in a June 27 debate against former President Donald Trump. Biden's uneven performance led to questions from the Democratic party and others about his age, cognitive health, his ability to beat Trump, and whether he was able to serve a second term.\n\nHere's a look at how the Biden campaign reached this historic decision to end Biden's candidacy for a second term.\n\nThe first debate\n\nBiden, who at 81 is the oldest sitting president in history, had already been facing concerns about his age before the CNN debate against Trump on June 27. However, Biden's debate performance increased questions not only about his ability to win against Trump, but his ability to execute his duties as president for another term.\n\nThe president's performance -- marred by a hoarse voice, often meandering answers, and a lack of strong attacks against Trump on key issues -- left some Democrats calling for him to step down.\n\nPresident Joe Biden addresses the nation from the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, July 14, 2024. Erin Schaff/AP\n\nPolls prompt further questions\n\nThe debate quickly hurt Biden's campaign. The two candidates were just about tied on the day of the debate, according to 538's national polling average. After the debate, Trump led Biden by two percentage points.\n\nAmid the scrutiny, Vice President Kamala Harris, whom Biden endorsed as his party's nominee in Sunday's statement announcing the end of his candidacy, had already emerged as a likely top contender to replace Biden.\n\nIn an Ipsos poll about a potential matchup between Harris and former President Donald Trump, released on July 2, Harris and Trump were nearly tied, with 42% supporting her and 43% supporting the former president\n\nAnother poll released by CNN in the first week of July found that a matchup between the vice president and Trump resulted in a 45-47% split between Harris and Trump, compared to the 43%-49% split between Biden and Trump.\n\nYet in a poll released July 11, which asked voter preferences if Vice President Kamala Harris were to replace Biden as the nominee, voter choices were 49-46%, Harris-Trump, among all adults and 49-47% among registered voters. Harris\u2019 49% was slightly better than Biden\u2019s 46%, although it wasn't a statistically significant lead over Trump.\n\nBiden defends campaign, explains performance\n\nPresident Joe Biden, in his first television interview following the debate against Trump, brushed off his poor performance.\n\n\"It was a bad episode,\" Biden told ABC News' George Stephanopoulos on July 5. \"No indication of any serious condition. I was exhausted. I didn't listen to my instincts in terms of preparing and -- and a bad night.\"\n\nBiden also said he was under the weather and \"feeling terrible.\"\n\n\"I asked if they did a COVID test because they're trying to figure out what was wrong. They did a test to see whether or not I had some infection, you know, a virus. I didn't. I just had a really bad cold,\" the president said.\n\nWhen Stephanopoulos asked: \"If you can be convinced that you cannot defeat Donald Trump, will you stand down?\"\n\nBiden responded: \"It depends on if the Lord Almighty comes down and tells me that, I might do that.\"\n\nIn a nearly hourlong solo press conference on July 11, Biden insisted that he's best situated to defeat former President Donald Trump this November, and said he was staying in the race despite his shaky debate performance.\n\nWhen asked if he would consider dropping out if his team showed data suggesting he could lose, he said: \"No, unless they came back and said, 'There\u2019s no way you can win' \u2026. No one is saying that. No poll says that.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden speaks from the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, July 14, 2024. Susan Walsh/AP\n\nTrump's assassination attempt and the RNC\n\nFormer President Donald Trump was shot in the ear in an assassination attempt at an election rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13.\n\nFollowing the shooting, as well as the Republican National Convention the following week, former President Donald Trump's favorability rating among Americans rose, while a majority of Americans wanted President Joe Biden to drop out of the race, according to an ABC News/Ipsos poll.\n\nTrump's favorability rating increased to 40% following last week's events, marking his highest favorability rating in four years of ABC News/Ipsos polling. For most of the last four years, it has hovered in the low- to mid-30% range.\n\nIts high over the last nine years was 42% in August of 2020 according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll conducted then. At the same time, about half of Americans, 51%, currently view Trump unfavorably, according to this most recent poll.\n\nBiden campaign scrambles amid questions\n\nABC News reported that Biden's support from party leaders began to crumble as reports that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and other top politicians spoke with him and his campaign about the worsening reelection outlook.\n\nOn July 11, Biden's campaign began testing head-to-head matchups of Vice President Kamala Harris against former President Donald Trump, a source familiar with the strategy told ABC News.\n\nPelosi spoke with President Joe Biden around the same time, telling the president that she and other members of the Democratic Party were concerned about him staying in the race, a source confirmed to ABC News.\n\nSchumer also had a meeting with Biden earlier this month. A knowledgeable source close to both men told ABC News that Schumer made the case that it would be best if Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race.\n\nHowever, on July 19, Biden said he would be returning to the campaign trail to continue to take on Trump following his COVID-19 diagnosis.\n\n\"I look forward to getting back on the campaign trail next week to continue exposing the threat of Donald Trump's Project 2025 agenda while making the case for my own record and the vision that I have for America: one where we save our democracy, protect our rights and freedoms, and create opportunity for everyone,\" Biden said in a statement.\n\nAccording to a new ABC News/Ipsos poll released on July 21, 60% of Democrats believe President Biden should drop out of the race for reelection.\n\nBiden drops out in historic move\n\nBiden said in a statement posted Sunday that he will \"stand down.\"\n\n\"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,\" he wrote, in part, in a letter posted on X. \"And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.\"\n\nIn another post on social media, Biden gave his \"full support and endorsement\" for Vice President Kamala Harris to be the Democratic Party's nominee.\n\nABC News' Tal Axelrod, Gary Langer, Ivan Pereira contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Can Kamala Harris win the US presidency after Joe Biden\u2019s withdrawal? Here\u2019s what the polls say\nThe United States election will be held on November 5. On Sunday US time, President Joe Biden withdrew from the presidential election contest and endorsed his vice president, Kamala Harris.\n\nIt\u2019s not certain, but very likely Harris will now be the Democratic candidate to face former Republican president Donald Trump in November. During the Democratic presidential primaries held early this year, Biden won about 95% of all delegates to the August 19\u201322 Democratic convention. These delegates are likely to support Harris given Biden\u2019s endorsement.\n\nSince the debate with Trump on June 27 that was widely thought to have been a disaster for Biden, he has faced pressure to withdraw. In an Ipsos poll for US ABC News that was released before Biden\u2019s withdrawal on Sunday, Democratic voters wanted Biden to withdraw by 60\u201339.\n\nFollowing the assassination attempt against Trump on July 13 and the Republican convention from July 15\u201318, Trump\u2019s lead over Biden in the FiveThirtyEight aggregate of national polls had increased to 3.2 points from 1.9 points on July 13, the largest margin since the aggregate began in March. Vote shares were 43.5% Trump, 40.2% Biden and 8.7% for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nI\u2019ve written previously that the presidency is not decided by the national popular vote. Instead each state has a certain amount of Electoral Votes (EVs), mostly based on population, with each state awarding their EVs winner takes all. It takes 270 EVs to win. The EV system is likely to skew to Trump, so Biden was further behind than in the national polls.\n\nBiden will continue as president until his term ends in January 2025. His net approval in the FiveThirtyEight aggregate is -17.7, with 56.2% disapproving and 38.5% approving. His net approval is worse than other previous presidents at this point in their term, except George Bush Sr and Jimmy Carter.\n\nTrump\u2019s net favourability in the FiveThirtyEight aggregate is -12.0, with 53.7% unfavourable and 41.7% favourable. His ratings are relatively unchanged since April. Unfortunately, FiveThirtyEight has no favourability ratings for Harris.\n\nWill Harris win?\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to analyse Harris vs Trump polls. Harris had not been a presidential candidate before today and name recognition of Biden explains his often better numbers than Harris. A recent national YouGov poll for CBS News gave Trump a five-point lead over Biden and a three-point lead over Harris.\n\nThere are two things that should advantage Harris. One is that economic data has improved, with inflation dropping and real earnings up. The other is that, while Biden would have been almost 82 by the election, Harris will only be 60 by then. Trump is 78, so the age split that was unfavourable to Biden will be favourable to Harris.\n\nNevertheless, nominating a candidate who has not been battle-tested in the primaries is very risky. When Harris ran for president in 2020, she withdrew from the contest in December 2019, before any primaries.\n\nHowever, with Biden\u2019s age of great concern to voters, and with him already behind Trump, switching to a new candidate could prove a sensible move for the Democrats. Changes in prime minister have worked for Australian parties in the past, with Malcolm Turnbull winning the 2016 federal election after replacing Tony Abbott, and Scott Morrison winning in 2019 after replacing Turnbull.\n\nWhile Biden has been losing, US Senate polls in the presidential swing states of Pennsylvania, Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan and Arizona suggest the Democratic candidates are winning, and doing much better than Biden. So perhaps Democrats just have a Biden problem.\n\nUS earnings up\n\nIn June, headline inflation dropped 0.1% after being unchanged in May and 12-month inflation dropped to 3.0%, the lowest it has been since June 2023. Core inflation was up 0.1% in June after increasing 0.2% in May and has increased 3.3% in the last 12 months, the smallest increase since April 2021.\n\nThe low inflation in May and June has boosted real (inflation-adjusted) earnings in those months, with real hourly earnings up 0.9% for May and June and real weekly earnings up 0.7%. In the 12 months to June, real hourly earnings are up 0.8% and real weekly earnings up 0.6%.\n\nIn June, a net 206,000 jobs were added, but the unemployment rate increased 0.1% to 4.1%. This is the highest unemployment rate since November 2021.",

Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats \u2014 it's time to come together and beat Trump,\" Biden wrote.\n\n\"Let's do this.\"\n\nHarris in a statement said, \"I am honored to have the President's endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination.\"\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in a joint statement from the Democratic power couple, said, \"We are honored to join the President in endorsing Vice President Harris and will do whatever we can to support her.\"\n\nBiden, who has been isolated at his Rehoboth, Delaware, beach home after being diagnosed with Covid-19, and Harris spoke on Sunday before he announced he would drop out of the election race.\n\nNBC News reported that Biden at 1:45 p.m. ET Sunday told his senior campaign team that he had changed his mind about remaining in the contest.\n\nOn Sunday evening, on a campaign staff call, Biden campaign co-chair Jen O'Malley Dillon called for staff to rally behind their new candidate and said that their jobs would safely transfer to the Harris campaign, three sources familiar with the call told NBC News.\n\nShe also acknowledged the emotional weight of the moment: \"It is ok to grieve, it is ok to be unsure but also be optimistic about our path forward.\"\n\nTrump in a phone interview with NBC News said of Biden's decision, \"He should never have been there in the first place.\"\n\n\"He should have stayed in his basement,\" said Trump, who was formally nominated as the Republican Party's candidate last week, days after narrowly avoiding being killed in an assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania campaign rally on July 13.\n\nDemocratic National Committee Jamie Harrison in a statement said, \"In the coming days, the Party will undertake a transparent and orderly process to move forward as a united Democratic Party with a candidate who can defeat Donald Trump in November.\"\n\n\"This process will be governed by established rules and procedures of the Party. Our delegates are prepared to take seriously their responsibility in swiftly delivering a candidate to the American people,\" Harrison said.",

        "text": "Biden drops out of the 2024 presidential race, endorses Vice President Kamala Harris for nomination\nPresident Biden announced Sunday that he is dropping out of the 2024 presidential race and threw his support behind Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n\"While it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as president for my term,\" Mr. Biden posted in a statement on social media.\n\nMr. Biden said he would address the nation later this week. Mr. Biden is currently at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, as he recovers from COVID-19.\n\nBiden backs Harris for nomination\n\nShortly after the announcement, he endorsed Harris for the Democratic nomination, although Mr. Biden cannot appoint a nominee himself. A source familiar said Mr. Biden and Harris spoke multiple times earlier Sunday ahead of his announcement. There was an emergency meeting of senior Democratic National Committee members happening Sunday.\n\n\"My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President,\" Mr. Biden posted on social media. \"And it's been the best decision I've made. Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats \u2014 it's time to come together and beat Trump. Let's do this.\"\n\nHarris issued a statement on Sunday saying she is \"honored to have the President's endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination.\"\n\n\"Over the past year, I have traveled across the country, talking with Americans about the clear choice in this momentous election,\" Harris said. \"And that is what I will continue to do in the days and weeks ahead. I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party\u2014and unite our nation\u2014to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda. We have 107 days until Election Day. Together, we will fight. And together, we will win.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden waves to the crowd at an appearance in Las Vegas on July 16, 2024. KENT NISHIMURA/AFP via Getty Images\n\nHarris also paid tribue to Mr. Biden, calling his decision to step aside for the 2024 race a \"selfless and patriotic act.\"\n\nTrump reaction\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, who was officially nominated by the Republican Party on Thursday night, told CNN after the decision that Mr. Biden is the \"worst president by far in the history of our country,\" but he said that he thought if Harris is the nominee, she would be easier to beat than Mr. Biden.\n\nTrump told CBS News' Robert Costa in a phone conversation that Mr. Biden's decision is a \"shock,\" but also said it is good for the country. Costa said Trump believes Mr. Biden was pressured out of the race, and it is a \"total shock to the country to have a president forced out by his own party,\" Costa said, describing Trump's view of the developments.\n\nBut Trump would not commit to debating Harris, telling Costa he is not sure Harris will be the nominee and Trump is waiting to see how the Democratic race shakes out.\n\nLater Sunday evening, Trump posted on Truth Social that his campaign had been \"forced to spend time and money\" running against Mr. Biden but \"now we have to start all over again.\"\n\n\"Shouldn't the Republican Party be reimbursed for fraud in that everybody around Joe, including his doctors and the Fake News Media, knew he was not capable of running for, or being, President?\" Trump wrote.\n\nWhat comes next for Democrats\n\nDNC chair Jaime Harrison said Sunday afternoon that \"in the coming days, the Party will undertake a transparent and orderly process to move forward as a united Democratic Party with a candidate who can defeat Donald Trump in November.\"\n\n\"This process will be governed by established rules and procedures of the Party. Our delegates are prepared to take seriously their responsibility in swiftly delivering a candidate to the American people,\" Harrison said.\n\nDNC executive committee member Alan Clendenin of Florida told CBS News on Sunday that he expects a \"supermajority\" of delegates to coalesce around Harris in the coming days.\n\n\"The delegates at the convention are the ones who place our candidate on the ballot,\" Clendenin said. \"If Biden was still on the ticket, that was going to be process.\"\n\nNever before has a sitting president and presumptive nominee dropped out of the race so late in the process, and Mr. Biden's decision to do so underscores the severity of the crisis that enveloped his campaign after his disastrous debate performance against Trump.\n\nIn the days following the debate, a growing chorus of Democrats openly expressed concern over the president's health and mental state, his ability to defeat Trump in November and his capacity to lead the country for four more years. The pressure to step aside steadily increased as Democratic lawmakers and governors went days without hearing from Mr. Biden directly, allowing questions about his future to swirl within the party ranks. And a growing number of Democrats on Capitol Hill publicly called for him to step aside.\n\nIn the weeks since the debate, the president tried to push back, insisting in a series of public appearances and meetings with Democratic elected officials that he was committed to staying in the race. \"I'm not going anywhere,\" he vowed. But even longtime allies began to urge him to change course.\n\nThe pressure eventually became insurmountable, with top Democrats in Congress telling Mr. Biden that he should step aside and allow a replacement to face off against Trump in November.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris laugh as they view the fireworks on the National Mall from the White House balcony on July 4, 2024. Samuel Corum / Getty Images\n\nMr. Biden is the first sitting president who is eligible for reelection to decline to run again since President Lyndon Johnson stepped aside the spring before the 1968 election. Johnson's vice president, Hubert Humphrey, won the Democratic nomination that year and lost to Richard Nixon.\n\nOnly a handful of first-term presidents in American history have not sought a second term, the last being Rutherford B. Hayes, who declined to run again in the 1880 election. James Buchanan and James Polk also chose not to seek the presidency a second time. Calvin Coolidge, who assumed the presidency in 1923 after the death of Warren Harding, won his own term in 1924 and declined to seek another full term four years later.\n\nBiden family reaction\n\nMembers of Mr. Biden's family publicly reacted Sunday to Mr. Biden's decision, with first lady Jill Biden reposting Mr. Biden's statement on social media with a heart emoji.\n\nHis granddaughter Naomi Biden posted shortly after his announcement that she is \"nothing but proud of my Pop, our President, Joe Biden, who has served our country with every bit of his soul and with unmatched distinction.\"\n\nNaomi Biden's father, Mr. Biden's son Hunter, said in statement posted by Naomi on social media that he has always looked at his father with \"awe.\"\n\n\"How could he suffer so much heartache and yet give so much of whatever remained of his heart to others?\" Hunter said. \"Not only in the policies he passed, but in the individual lives he's touched.\"\n\nHunter added \"thank you, Mr. President. I love you, Dad.\"\n\nMr. Biden's brother, Frank, told ABC News that his brother's decision to step out of the race \"boils down\" to his \"overall health and vitality\" but also \"beating this genuine threat to our nation in the form of Donald Trump.\" Frank Biden also told CBS News that \"selfishly I will have him back to enjoy whatever time we have left in our lives.\"\n\nBut a source familiar with the Biden family pushed back against Frank's statement, telling CBS News \"Frank Biden suffers from alcoholism and hasn't spoken to his brother, the President, in weeks. What he said about President Biden's health being a factor in his decision is completely untrue.\"\n\nA disastrous debate\n\nFor months, the Biden campaign and allies reassured the public that the president was up to the rigors of leading the free world, often dismissing questions about his age and fitness even as polls consistently showed Americans had concerns. Mr. Biden would be 86 at the end of a second term.\n\nBut on the night of the debate on June 27, over 50 million Americans watched the president, lacking his teleprompter and without notes, struggle not only to refute Trump, but to articulate his own policies. Mr. Biden, never the most eloquent speaker, repeatedly lost his train of thought and confused his answers, at one point saying his administration \"beat Medicare.\"\n\nThe flubs baffled members of his own party, many of whom soon recognized the political peril of having Mr. Biden at the top of the ticket if the overwhelming majority of voters considered him not fit to serve.\n\nBefore winning the White House in 2020, Mr. Biden called himself a \"bridge\" to a new \"generation of leaders,\" causing many to wonder if he would only serve one term. In the aftermath of the debate, he explained that his thinking had changed, and the divisiveness in the country led him to believe only he could defeat Trump.\n\nAfter days of his campaign and other allies trying to contain the fallout, the dam had broken, and the president faced pressure from a growing number of Democrats on Capitol Hill to step aside and let a new nominee step up to the plate. He resisted that pressure for more than a week, defiantly and publicly stating that he would not drop his reelection bid. But he continued to misspeak in interviews and speeches, doing little to allay concerns about his ability to win in November.\n\nCalls for him to step aside died down in the aftermath of the failed assassination attempt of Trump on July 13. But behind the scenes, Democratic leaders in Congress were reportedly urging him to make his exit, and polls showed large majorities of Democratic voters saying they preferred a different nominee. News of that private pressure campaign began to break on July 17, coinciding with a call from powerful Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff for Mr. Biden to drop out.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee also pushed back a virtual vote that would have cemented Mr. Biden's status as the nominee, saying on July 17 that plans for a quick resolution would be pushed back until August. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries were said to have encouraged the party's rules committee to delay the vote.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nStates have already held their primaries, meaning Democratic voters have no time or mechanism to pick a replacement directly. At this point in the process, it's up to Democratic delegates \u2014 state and local party officials who were selected during the primaries \u2014 to decide who will replace Mr. Biden at the top of the ticket, either at August's Democratic National Convention in Chicago or beforehand. However it ultimately happens will be a logistical nightmare for Democrats in the weeks ahead.\n\nThe convention is scheduled to begin Aug. 19 in Chicago.\n\nThe party affirmed Friday it would hold a virtual roll call between Aug. 1-7 to formally select a nominee to ensure access to the ballot in Ohio. amid a dispute about the state's ballot certification deadline. Whether that happens now that Mr. Biden has dropped out remains to be seen.\n\n\u2013Ed O'Keefe and Aaron Navarro contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Joe Biden endorses Kamala Harris after he drops out of 2024 election: Recap\nEditor's note: This page reflects the news of Joe Biden stepping aside from his 2024 presidential campaign on Sunday, July 21. For the latest news on Kamala Harris' efforts to secure the Democratic nomination, follow our live election updates for Monday, July 22.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2212 President Joe Biden said Sunday he is ending his bid for reelection amid intense pressure from Democratic leaders sounding the alarm that his path to beat former President Donald Trump in November had vanished.\n\nThe president's historic withdrawal throws the 2024 race \u2212 already roiled by a shocking attempt on Trump's life \u2212 into uncertain territory, with Vice President Kamala Harris widely seen as the Democrat most likely to take Biden's place atop the party's ticket.\n\nBiden made the announcement from his home in Rehoboth Beach, Del., where he's self-isolated since testing positive for COVID-19 Thursday night.\n\nBiden quickly endorsed Harris as the Democratic nominee in a separate statement on X. Harris responded that she's honored to have Biden's endorsement, and her \"intention is to earn and win this nomination.\" The president and vice president spoke several times on Sunday morning ahead of his announcement.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nBiden said he would speak to the nation later this week to provide more details about his decision.\n\n\"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,\" Biden said in a letter addressed to Americans. \"And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and my country for me to stand down and to focus solely on my duties as President for the rest of my term.\"\n\nIn his statement, Biden reflected fondly on his four years in office, saying the U.S. has built the \u201cstrongest economy in the world\u201d while touting efforts to lower prescription drug prices, expand health care, tackle climate change and appointing the first Black woman to the Supreme Court, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nThe decision upends the 2024 campaign 107 days before Election Day, with Democratic National Committee members now tasked with choosing an alternative nominee to take on Trump, whose polling lead has swelled while Democrats have fought internally.\n\nBiden's departure will soon mean the end of a five-decade career in Washington that began in 1972 with an upset victory for U.S. Senate in Delaware. He served as a senator for 36 years, then as Obama's vice president from 2009 to 2017. Biden returned to public life to run against Trump in the 2020 presidential election. He framed the race as a \"battle for the soul of the nation\" and defeated Trump 51%-47% in the popular vote.\n\nIt marks an extraordinary turn for Biden, who for three weeks remained defiant in the face of growing calls from Democratic lawmakers that he withdraw after a disastrous June 27 debate with Trump raised scrutiny over the president's mental fitness.\n\nKeep up with the USA TODAY Network's live updates.\n\nLouisiana Democratic delegation endorses Harris\n\nWhile President Biden's delegates at the upcoming Democratic National Convention are not formally obligated to follow his lead and back Vice President Kamala Harris as his replacement at the top of the ticket, the Louisiana delegation is already onboard.\n\n\"This evening, the LA delegation to the @DemConvention met virtually, and by an overwhelming majority vote, officially endorsed Vice President @KamalaHarris to be our 2024 Democratic Presidential Nominee,\" the state party reported on X.\n\n-Ben Adler\n\nCongressional Hispanic Caucus BOLD PAC endorses Harris\n\nIn a sign of coalescing Democratic Party unity around Harris, the campaign arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, BOLD PAC, announced Sunday night that it is endorsing President Biden's chosen successor.\n\nJust a few days ago, BOLD PAC stood squarely behind Biden amid growing calls for him to drop out.\n\n\"President Biden's tenure will be remembered for his accomplishments that stand among the best in history,\u201d said BOLD PAC Chair Rep. Linda Sa\u0301nchez, D-Calif., in the statement Sunday.\n\n\"As we look ahead, we know that these accomplishments would not have been possible without Vice President Kamala Harris and CHC BOLD PAC is proud to endorse her for president. This administration has led with working families in mind and shown an unwavering commitment to Latinos. There is so much work left to do and the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher. Make no mistake, Latinos nationwide will bear the brunt of the consequences of a Trump second presidency, just like they did in the past. BOLD PAC will remain laser focused on doing what it takes to ensure that Trump remains a one-term president. Vice President Harris is the leader we stand behind at this critical moment.\n\n-Ben Adler\n\nHow Harris would run against Trump\n\nA campaign ad from Harris' 2020 Democratic presidential primary campaign sheds light on how she might run against Trump if she becomes the Democratic nominee.\n\nThe ad, which was shared Sunday afternoon by a pro-Harris account on X, characterizes Harris as the antidote to Trump. It leans heavily on her work as a prosecutor and contrasts that record with Trump's alleged misdeeds.\n\n\"She prosecuted sex predators, he is one,\" the narrator notes, followed by the recording of Trump's crudely phrased statement that he grabs women by their genitals.\n\nThe ad goes on to draw similar comparisons. Whereas Harris prosecuted for-profit colleges that swindled students, Trump ran a for-profit university that was sued by former students who said they were misled by false claims. Trump agreed to a $25 million settlement\n\n-Ben Adler\n\nDemocrats raise nearly $50 million online since Biden\u2019s exit\n\nDemocrats have raised nearly $50 million online since President Joe Biden announced his decision on Sunday to drop out of the 2024 race and endorse Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee.\n\nActBlue, the leading site processing Democratic donations, said as of 9 p.m. ET it has raised $46.7 million from supporters, making Sunday its biggest fundraising day of the 2024 election cycle.\n\nMost of the Democratic Party has coalesced quickly around Harris as the nominee, making her the strong favorite to take on Trump in November.\n\n\u2212Joey Garrison\n\nJoe Manchin is considering seeking Democratic nomination\n\nSen Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., is considering switching his party affiliation from independent to Democratic to seek the party's presidential nomination after President Joe Biden announced Sunday that he will exit the 2024 race, according to Manchin's adviser Jonathan Kott.\n\nHe is the first Democrat to openly consider challenging Vice President Kamala Harris for the nomination. Manchin, 76, previously flirted with the idea of launching an independent campaign for the presidency, and at one point even floated appearing on a ballot with Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, but decided not to in mid-February.\n\nManchin is unlikely to receive much support from Democrats, given his record of bucking some of the party\u2019s major legislative proposals and his decision to register as an independent in May.\n\n-Karissa Waddick\n\nHarris makes the rounds\n\nVice President Kamala Harris spent her afternoon working the phones, calling Democratic Party leaders and members of Congress as she sought to quickly coalesce lawmakers and potential competitors around her candidacy. Among the Democratic officials she spoke to were Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a rising star in the party who leads a must-win battleground state, House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries and Congressional Black Caucus Chair Steven Horsford, according to a source familiar.\n\nHarris has plans to be in Milwaukee on Tuesday and Indianapolis on Wednesday at previously scheduled events. It was not immediately clear when she planned to hold her first campaign event after Biden's surprise dropout and endorsement on Sunday.\n\n-Francesca Chambers\n\nAOC endorses Harris for Democratic nomination\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., a key progressive Democrat, endorsed Harris for the Democratic nomination Sunday night as Harris continues to coalesces most of the Democratic Party around her bid.\n\n\u201cKamala Harris will be the next President of the United States. I pledge my full support to ensure her victory in November,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement on X.\n\n\u201cNow more than ever, it is crucial that our party and country swiftly unite to defeat Donald Trump and the threat to American democracy. Let\u2019s get to work.\u201d\n\nWhile 35 congressional Democrats publicly called for Biden to end his campaign prior to his announcement, Ocasio-Cortez was among those who remained behind the president.\n\n\u2212Joey Garrison\n\nTrump raises questions about the next debate\n\nIs Trump laying the groundwork to forgo a debate against Harris (or any other Democrat)?\n\nIn a Truth Social post late Sunday, Trump noted that his Sept. 10 debate with Biden \"was slated to be broadcast\" on ABC.\n\n\"Now that Joe has, not surprisingly, has quit the race, I think the Debate, with whomever the Radical Left Democrats choose, should be held on FoxNews, rather than very biased ABC.\"\n\nIn an interview with CBS News, Trump gave a somewhat equivocal answer to the debate question: \"I don\u2019t know who I'm going to debate. So far, we haven\u2019t determined who is going to be on that side. But I think whoever it is, I\u2019d like to debate. Yeah, sure.\"\n\n-David Jackson\n\nTennessee Democrats become first delegation to formally endorse Harris for president\n\nTennessee\u2019s 77 Democratic delegates voted by conference call Sunday afternoon to formally endorse Vice President Kamala Harris for the Democratic nomination, becoming the first delegates previously pledged to Biden in any state to formally back her.\n\nThe decision comes as much of the Democratic establishment, including former President Joe Biden, has quickly coalesced behind Harris following Biden\u2019s announcement to end his 2024 campaign.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very compelling to me that the president decided not to run and to endorse her,\u201d Chip Forrester, one of the Tennessee delegates, told USA TODAY. \u201cHe has worked with her for four years. He chose her as his running mate four years ago. For the president to have that kind of confidence is important to me.\u201d\n\nForrester said Harris also holds as strong \u201cstrategic position\u201d because she will inherit Biden\u2019s $240 million cash on hand that his campaign reported at the end of June.\n\nThe Harris campaign took over the Biden campaign committee following Biden\u2019s announcement to drop out.\n\n-- Joey Garrison and Melissa Brown\n\nPotential lawsuits to keep Biden as Democratic nominee would be fruitless: election experts\n\nRepublicans argued Democrats will be ignoring 14 million voters who supported President Joe Biden in the primaries after he declined to become the nominee, but election experts said Sunday that potential lawsuits aiming to keep Biden as the nominee would be fruitless.\n\n\u201cDemocrat party bosses just proved that they have absolutely no respect for their own voters,\u201dHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said in a statement. \u201cAfter lecturing others about democracy, they just forced Joe Biden off the ticket, trashing the primary choice of 14 million of their own voters.\u201d\n\nBut David Becker, a former Justice Department lawyer who enforced election laws and is now executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, said potential lawsuits from Republicans or allies of former President Donald Trump couldn\u2019t force the Democratic Party to stick with Biden because parties choose their own nominees.\n\n\u201cThese claims are less than frivolous,\u201d Becker said. \u201cThat would not succeed and will not succeed in any state.\u201d\n\nBiden was not yet the Democratic nominee because the party has not yet held its convention scheduled for late August. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously in March that Colorado election officials couldn\u2019t keep Trump off the state\u2019s primary ballot because allowing states to set qualifications for federal office would lead to \u201cchaos.\u201d\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nMore:Who will be Kamala Harris' VP? Here's the possible contenders.\n\nJohn Kerry supports Kamala Harris as party\u2019s next nominee\n\nJohn Kerry, former Secretary of State under the Obama administration, in a statement on X, formerly Twitter, indicated he will join in on supporting Vice President Kamala Harris as the party\u2019s next nominee.\n\n\u201cPresident Biden deserves the gratitude of every American for his extraordinary presidency\u2026I know how difficult today\u2019s selfless decision must have been for someone who spent his entire life in service to country,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that \u201cnow is the time to listen to the only person who has ever beaten Donald Trump, and join with President Biden in every effort to make Vice President Harris the next President of the United States.\u201d\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nElection expert says no way to hold more Democratic presidential primaries\n\nDavid Becker, a former Justice Department lawyer who enforced elections law and who now advises state and local officials who conduct elections, slammed the door Sunday on the potential for holding more presidential primaries before the Democratic National Convention in late August, calling it a \u201cfantasy.\u201d\n\nPresident Joe Biden was the presumptive Democratic nominee after winning state primaries. Some political analysts, such as GOP podcaster Mike Murphy, have suggested Vice President Kamala Harris would be a stronger nominee if she beat potential rivals in a new set of primaries.\n\n\u201cShe needs to become a winner, which means winning a nomination process,\u201d Murphy wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. \u201cThat would give her a lot more strength coming out of the convention.\u201d\n\nBut Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, said states such as Arizona and Florida are still holding local primaries into September, so there is no way election officials could create a new set of primaries within days or weeks.\n\n\u201cThe idea that election officials who are already running elections could somehow put together a snap primary in days, and voters would know what to do and where to show up and to cast ballots for candidates we can\u2019t even imagine who might be running is fantasy. There is no feasible way to hold any kind of primaries right now,\u201d said Becker, who is also executive director of the Election Official Legal Defense Network. \u201cThere is no way to do open primaries.\u201d\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nLaPhonza Butler, only Black woman serving in U.S. Senate, backs Harris\n\nCalifornia\u2019s Laphonza Butler, the only Black woman serving in the U.S. Senate, applauded Biden\u2019s service and urged support for Harris. Butler was tapped to serve in the seat when Biden picked Harris for his running mate.\n\n\u201cThe threat to all that progress remains, and we must now do everything we can to ensure Vice President Harris succeeds,\u2019\u2019 Butler, the first woman of color to head EMILY's List, an organization that supports Democratic, pro-abortion rights women candidates, said in a statement. \u201cThere's no one better prepared for this challenge.\u2019\u2019\n\nHarris, the daughter of an Indian mother and Jamaican father, was the second Black woman to serve in the U.S. Senate. Others vying to make similar history praised Harris\u2019 bid for president.\n\nAngela Alsobrooks, a Democrat and a Black woman running for the U.S. Senate in Maryland, said she is 100% behind Harris.\n\n\u201cShe will provide a clear and stark contrast to the regressive vision Donald Trump has for this country,\u2019\u2019 she said in a statement. \u201cShe will make this race about the future and the kind of country our children deserve to inherit.\u201d\n\n-- Deborah Barfield Berry\n\nHarris takes over Biden campaign committee\n\nThe former Biden campaign is now officially the Harris for President campaign.\n\nThe campaign formerly known as Biden for President in a filing Sunday afternoon with the Federal Election Commission changed its name to the Harris for President campaign.\n\nThe move makes Harris\u2019 bid for the Democratic nomination official, with her campaign apparently assuming control of Biden\u2019s campaign funds. The move also allows Harris to begin raising money for her presidential bid. Harris named Keana Spencer her treasurer.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nEmily\u2019s List endorses Kamala Harris for president\n\nEmily\u2019s List, an organization that supports Democratic, pro-abortion rights women candidates, endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in a post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n\u201c.@kamalaharris was made for this moment,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThroughout her career, she has been a steadfast fighter for women and reproductive freedom \u2014 a role that is more important than ever before.

The pledged delegates for each state are bound by state rules to vote for their candidate X number of times under state law,\" O'Brien explained. \"If Biden has enough to win, then he can decline, which will throw it immediately into a brokered convention. I don't know what it means with Harris on the ticket and much of this would come down to state law on whether or not she wins those pledged delegates.\"\n\n\u2212 Darren Samuelsohn\n\nNational Ice Cream Day: A fitting day for Biden\n\nIt\u2019s no secret: Joe Biden loves ice cream.

Kennedy Jr. said in a statement on X, formerly Twitter, that he commends President Joe Biden for stepping out of the 2024 race.\n\n\u201cHis infirmities were evident to any unbiased observer from the beginning. It was this progressive deterioration \u2014 and his abandonment of Democratic Party principles \u2014 that prompted me to enter the race and ensure American voters had a viable, vigorous alternative to Donald Trump,\u201d said Kennedy.\n\nHe also called on the Democratic Party to \u201creturn to its traditional commitment to democracy and exemplify it with an open process.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead of anointing a candidate hand-picked by DNC elites, the party should use neutral polling to identify the candidate who can best beat Donald Trump.

We are forever grateful,\" he said.\n\n\u2212 Kathryn Palmer\n\nDNC chair says Democrats will launch process of choosing new candidate\n\nDemocratic National Committee chairman Jaime Harrison said in the coming days Democrats will \u201cundertake a transparent and orderly process to move forward as a united Democratic Party with a candidate who can defeat Donald Trump in November.\u201d\n\nHarrison said the process will be \u201cgoverned by established rules and procedures of the Party.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur delegates are prepared to take seriously their responsibility in swiftly delivering a candidate to the American people,\u201d Harrison said, adding that the American people will hear \u201cin short order\u201d from the Democratic Party on the next steps in the nomination process.\n\nThe DNC convention is set for Aug. 19 to 22 in Chicago, but Democratic National Committee leaders have planned for a virtual roll-call vote before Aug. 7 to satisfy concerns with ballot deadlines in several states.\n\n\u2212 Joey Garrison\n\nJosh Shapiro calls Biden a 'patriot'\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro hailed Joe Biden as a \u201cpatriot\u201d and commended his work as president in a social media post on Sunday shortly after the president announced he was dropping out of the 2024 race.\u201cPresident Biden has gotten an incredible amount done to move our country forward, defend our democracy, and protect real freedom,\u201d Shapiro wrote on X, formerly Twitter.Shapiro has been floated as a potential Democratic presidential nominee to replace Biden, or as a vice presidential nominee if Kamala Harris takes over the top of the ticket. Shapiro did not mention Harris in his message Sunday.\u201cI am proud to work by his side and am grateful for his leadership and his unwavering commitment to delivering for Pennsylvania \u2014 the Commonwealth that raised him,\u201d Shapiro said about Biden in the post.\n\n\u2212Karissa Waddick\n\nSchumer says Biden put 'his country, his party, and our future first'\n\nChuck Schumer shared in a post on X that \"Joe Biden has not only been a great president and a great legislative leader but he's a truly amazing human being.\"\n\n\"His decision of course was not easy, but he once again put his country, his party, and our future first. Joe, today shows you are a true patriot and great American,\" he added.\n\n\u2212Marina Pitofsky\n\nBiden exits race amid widespread pressure, mounting concerns about his age\n\nBiden's exit came after he received bleak warnings from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Democratic House Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., that his candidacy could lead to massive losses for Democrats in the Senate and House. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi shared similar concerns to Biden.\n\nMore than 30 congressional Democrats had called for Biden to bow out. Former President Barack Obama reportedly also relayed fears privately to Democratic allies about Biden's prospects of beating Trump. Democratic donors from Hollywood to Wall Street also came out against Biden continuing his reelection bid.\n\nBiden, 81, has battled Americans\u2019 concerns over his age since he took office but it turned into panic for Democrats after last month's first debate with Trump, the Republican nominee. Biden's voice sounded faint, he struggled to complete sentences and finish thoughts, and he failed to rebut many of Trump's claims on the debate stage.\n\nBiden's campaign was in a free fall over the past few weeks with his future in doubt. Instead of focusing solely on Trump, Democrats spent as much time and energy debating whether Biden could even defeat his predecessor.\n\nFundraising for the Biden campaign took a dramatic hit. And Biden not only fell behind in key battleground states that will decide the election, but his growing unpopularity seemed to put recent Democratic strongholds like Virginia in play for Trump.\n\n\u2212Joey Garrison and Swapna Venugopal\n\nBiden becomes first incumbent not to seek reelection since LBJ\n\nBiden becomes the first incumbent president not to seek reelection since Lyndon B. Johnson who, in 1968 amid national unrest and turmoil within the Democratic Party over the Vietnam War, stunned the nation with his decision not to seek a second full term.\n\n\u2212 Joey Garrison\n\nWho could replace Biden?\n\nWith Biden's endorsement, Harris is the clear frontrunner to replace Biden as the Democratic nominee, but the party's bench of Democratic governors could also be in the mix including Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Gavin Newsom of California.\n\n\u2212 Joey Garrison\n\nTrump knocks Biden after exit\n\nDonald Trump, in a post on his social media web site Truth Social after Biden\u2019s exit, wrote: \"Crooked Joe Biden was not fit to run for President, and is certainly not fit to serve - And never was!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will suffer greatly because of his presidency, but we will remedy the damage he has done very quickly,\u201d Trump added.\n\n\u2212Joey Garrison\n\nJill Biden reacts to Joe Biden dropping out of 2024 race\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden on Sunday reposted the president's message with heart emojis. She also retweeted her husband's message endorsing Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.\n\n\u2212 Marina Pitofsky",

        "text": "Trump vs. Harris: What Each Administration Would Mean for the Travel Industry\nPresident Joe Biden\u2019s decision to leave the 2024 U.S. presidential race put an unprecedented twist on what was always going to be an unconventional election. But one thing is clear: Each potential administration\u2019s policies will be wildly different \u2013 and have significant implications on the global travel industry.\n\nThe article discusses the potential impacts of the 2024 presidential election on the travel industry, focusing on the differences between a Trump-Vance and a Harris administration. A second Trump administration could mean a rollback of environmental regulations, visa delays, a revival of travel bans, and a mixed approach to airline mergers. On the other hand, a Harris administration might continue the Biden administration's hardline stance on mergers, improve visa processing times, maintain moderate immigration policies, and focus on climate change and international relations.\n\nWith the 2024 Republican presidential ticket of Donald Trump and J.D. Vance solidified last week in Milwaukee, Democrats have a lot of work to do before their convention in less than a month \u2013 now without an official candidate or a vice presidential nominee.\n\nOn Sunday, just after announcing he would be stepping out of the race, President Biden endorsed his vice president, Kamala Harris, for the role. This comes only days after the former president Trump was shot at a campaign rally, surviving the assassination attempt with only minor injuries. Days later he selected populist icon, Ohio senator J.D. Vance, as his running mate.\n\nFor the travel industry, whichever of the two tickets prevails in November will mean a wildly different landscape for the next four years.\n\nBut we\u2019ve seen a Trump presidency before. And we can look to the last four years of Biden-Harris for hints of what she might do if she\u2019s ultimately both a) the candidate and b) elected in November.\n\nA Second Trump Administration\n\nReading the tea leaves from the former president\u2019s policies on visas, regulation, the environment and more, we could see some of the following actions impacting the travel industry if the former president is elected a second time.\n\n\n\nThe DOT\u2019s New Junk Fee Disclosure Rule Could Be At Risk: The new junk fee disclosure rule is set to take effect in October and requires airlines to disclose all fees associated with buying a ticket. Major airlines have already sued to block it.\n\nThe text of the rule in the Federal Register notes that a 2017 executive order from the Trump administration undid a similar rule before it could take effect.\n\nProject 2025, a series of conservative policy proposals that Trump has not publicly endorsed, refers to \u201cburdensome disclosure mandates\u201d in the chapter on the Department of Transportation. \u201cThe Trump Administration reformed the process for issuing such \u2018unfair and deceptive practices\u2019 rules, but the Biden Administration promptly reversed those reforms. A new Administration should restore them.\u201d\n\nVisa Delays: It might take longer to get a visa. During the first Trump Administration there was a hiring freeze of visa processing staff at the State Department. This, coupled with high pent-up demand, reduced staff during the pandemic, boosted vetting procedures and caused delays and denials in visa issuance for many applicants, particularly those from countries flagged for higher security concerns\u200b\u200b.\n\nA Revival of Travel Bans: The administration\u2019s travel bans could be reinstated or expanded under his next administration. In January 2017, the Trump administration issued Executive Order 13769 and restricted entry to the United States for citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. The Biden-Harris administration revoked these bans.\n\nAn Inconsistent Merger Atmosphere. A second Trump administration could be more friendly to airlines looking for consolidation, but there\u2019s also a chance it could have a more populist approach. During Trump\u2019s first term, his administration held an \u201cinconsistent\u201d stance on mergers, according to a law journal that specializes in antitrust issues \u2013 the Trump administration controversially approved the Northeast Alliance between American Airlines and JetBlue. Yet it sought to block high profile mergers, such as AT&T-Time Warner.\n\nDoubling Down on an \u201cAmerica First\u201d Approach: The former president continues to campaign on his Make America Great Again platform. This stance was not popular with many of America\u2019s historic allies and could result in reduced international cooperation and potentially strained relationships with some countries, affecting global travel patterns and international tourism.\n\nGreater Infrastructure Investments: The former president likes infrastructure. He famously called La Guardia airport \u2013 which has since been beautifully transformed \u2013 \u201cthird world\u201d during a 2016 debate with Hillary Clinton. He also proposed an ultimately unsuccessful $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan aimed to invest in various projects over 10 years. That plan faced significant challenges in Congress and ended with no major bill being passed\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b. In a second administration, he could likely try again \u2013 especially if he has a friendlier congress.\n\nFewer Environmental Rules: Prepare for less environmental regulation. The Trump administration relaxed climate rules during its initial term. This included weakening standards on air and water quality, reducing restrictions on fossil fuel production, and changing rules that had been designed to limit pollution from power plants and vehicles. He also withdrew the United States from the Paris Climate Accord on June 1, 2017, arguing that the agreement was unfair to the U.S. and would undermine the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nA Possible Hardline on USA\u2019s DMO: During the first Trump administration, it tried to eliminate funding for Brand USA, America\u2019s national destination marketing organization. In a 2018 budget proposal, the administration proposed cutting the government\u2019s annual funding to Brand USA and putting it toward the Department of Homeland Security. Ultimately, however, the Brand USA Extension Act reauthorized the DMO through 2027.\n\nA New Harris Administration\n\nIn the event Vice President Kamala Harris becomes the the democratic nominee for president and she is able to beat Donald Trump at the polls in November, here\u2019s what it might mean for the travel sector.\n\nA Continued Hard Line on Mergers. The Biden administration has been hawkish on antitrust enforcement, successfully suing to block the JetBlue-Spirit merger \u2014 the first airline merger blocked in the past two decades. It also undid the Northeast Alliance. Now, the Biden administration is expected to release a decision on the Alaska-Hawaiian merger in the coming months.\n\nProgress on Visa Wait Times: For much of 2022 and 2023, visa wait times remained stuck at over 400 days on average for first-time travelers in some top inbound markets, a hangover from the pandemic.\n\nThe State Department has implemented a series of changes like waiving interviews for select applicants, moving staff to countries with large backlogs, and hiring staff back to pre-pandemic levels. In December 2023, the State Department extended its visa interview waiver authority for visa applicants indefinitely.\n\nAs of June 2024, according to U.S. Travel, U.S. visa wait times for major non-exempt source countries remain elevated, but have dropped to 300 days.\n\nSome embassies, like in India, have seen major improvements, with a record number of visas issued. President Biden told Eric Garcetti, U.S. Ambassador to India, to tackle the visa delays, the ambassador said at the Skift India Summit.\n\nMore Passport Processing: Like with visas, the State Department has reduced processing times, from an 18-week high in 2021 to between 6 and 8 weeks in December 2023. A record 24 million passports were issued in the 2023 fiscal year. The State Department plans to establish half a dozen new passport agencies, bringing its network to 35.\n\nModerate Immigration Policy: Harris would likely adopt a more moderate stance on immigration than a Trump administration, potentially easing visa processes and encouraging more international visitors to the U.S. The Biden-Harris administration also revoked the Trump administration\u2019s travel ban.\n\nA Continued Investment in International Relations: Harris\u2019s global stance would likely mirror the Biden administration\u2019s foreign policy objectives \u2013 including its commitment to alliances such as NATO. Her experience as vice president in meeting world leaders could foster improved diplomatic ties, potentially leading to increased bilateral tourism agreements and easier travel between countries.\n\nA Focus On the Climate Crisis: The travel industry can expect a continued focus on climate change from Harris. In 2021, the Biden-Harris administration re-entered the Paris Climate Accord after the Trump administration pulled out of the agreement in 2017. That re-committed the U.S. to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and working with other nations to combat global warming\u200b\u200b.\n\nAirlines\u2019 Automatic Refunds: In addition to the new junk fee disclosure rule, the Department of Transportation in the Biden-Harris administration passed a requirement that airlines provide automatic cash refunds in instances where flights are significantly delayed or canceled, checked baggage is delayed or when ancillary services that were paid for are not provided. It\u2019s due to take effect in October.\n\nSkift will be closely following all developments and reporting on how the 2024 election could impact the travel sector.",

        "text": "What is an open convention?\nFollowing President Joe Biden\u2019s withdrawal from the presidential race, the Democratic Party\u2019s focus has turned to its nominating convention, which will likely be the first open Democratic convention in decades.\n\nHere is a look at how open conventions work, how the party chooses its nominee and what types of candidates are successful.\n\nWhat is an open convention?\n\nAn \u201copen\u201d convention happens when there is no predetermined nominee at the start of a convention. At this year\u2019s Democratic National Convention, delegates who were once bound to nominate Biden can cast their votes for any new candidate.\n\nWhat are contested or brokered conventions?\n\n\u201cContested\u201d or \u201cbrokered\u201d conventions are types of open conventions. While there is no official definition, most experts agree that a contested convention is one in which no candidate has secured a majority of delegates before the convention\u2019s start. It can turn into a \u201cbrokered\u201d or \u201cmulti-balloted\u201d convention if no candidate wins the nomination on the first ballot.\n\nWhen was the last multi-balloted convention?\n\nThe last conventions to fail to nominate a candidate on the first ballot were in 1952, with both Democrats and Republicans needing multiple ballots to nominate Adlai Stevenson and Dwight Eisenhower, respectively. Eisenhower won the general election.\n\nWhen was the last contested convention?\n\nThe last time there was serious doubt about who a convention would nominate was in 1976, when Republican candidates Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan both amassed a significant number of delegates in the primary elections, but neither won enough to secure the nomination outright. Ford went on to win the Republican nomination on the first ballot but would lose the general election to Democrat Jimmy Carter.\n\nAre open conventions rare?\n\nWhile open conventions in the modern era are relatively rare, they were the way political parties chose their presidential nominees throughout much of America\u2019s history. \u201cBrokered\u201d conventions are called that because they often resulted from party leaders brokering the winner in backroom deals.\n\nHow did primaries change the conventions?\n\nThe introduction of the primary system in the early 1900s, in which states set up nominating contests, began to shift the way parties selected their nominees. However, primaries during the first half of the century were still secondary in importance to nominating conventions. Political leaders used the primaries to test the viability of possible candidates, but the conventions still determined the nomination outcome.\n\nWhat changed in 1968?\n\nThe most significant change to the party convention system came from the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago. Convention leaders chose Hubert Humphrey as the nominee despite Eugene McCarthy, an anti-war candidate, receiving more primary votes. The choice led to protests and violence outside the convention and political upheaval inside the hall. In the following years, both parties initiated reforms to ensure a majority of convention delegates were bound to the primary election outcomes.\n\nWhat changed after the 2016 election?\n\nDemocrats further changed their rules after the 2016 election when many \u201csuperdelegates\u201d \u2014 unpledged delegates who are party leaders \u2014 announced early support for Hillary Clinton, creating the perception that they were trying to influence the nominating contest against Bernie Sanders. Beginning in the 2020 election, the superdelegates were no longer allowed to vote in the first ballot at the convention, unless there was no doubt about the outcome of the contest.\n\nWhat does the Constitution say about party conventions?\n\nThe U.S. Constitution does not mention parties or their nomination processes. However, the Supreme Court has recognized political parties as being covered by the \u201cfreedom of association\u201d clause of the First Amendment. Over the years, courts have given political parties wide latitude on how they operate.\n\nWho are the convention delegates?\n\nThe roughly 4,000 Democratic delegates have strong ties to their political party. They can include local party workers, union members, office holders and fundraisers. While voters cast ballots for delegate slots tied to presidential candidates, the delegates themselves are often not chosen until weeks or months after the primary vote.\n\nDo the individual delegates matter?\n\nIf there is not a contested election, the identity of the individual delegates does not matter much to the average voter. The delegates will cheer at the convention and will formally nominate the party\u2019s presidential candidate. However, in the case of a contested election, the delegates could matter a great deal with the freedom to back any candidate.\n\nWho can delegates nominate?\n\n\u201cPledged\u201d delegates make up the majority of delegates \u2014 about 85% \u2014 and are pledged to back the candidate that voters elected.

Mr Biden says he will remain president until January.\n\nMs Harris, 59, said that she was \"honoured\" to be endorsed, adding she would \"earn and win this nomination\" and unite the country against Trump.\n\n\"We have 107 days until election day,\" she said. \"Together, we will fight. And together, we will win.\"\n\nWhile Ms Harris has been picking up endorsements from many big figures in the party, she is yet to be officially nominated, and that may not happen until the Democratic National Convention in August.\n\nA resurgent Trump meanwhile has pulled ahead in polling and was confirmed as Republican nominee at the party's convention in Milwaukee this week, five days after surviving an assassination attempt.\n\nIn the wake of Mr Biden's decision, he declared the president \"was not fit to run... and is certainly not fit to serve\". Other senior Republicans joined him in their criticism, and called on Mr Biden to leave the White House immediately, not just the Democratic candidacy.",

        "text": "Secretary Mayorkas Names Bipartisan Independent Law Enforcement Experts For 45-Day Independent Review of July 13, 2024, Attempted Assassination of Former President Donald Trump\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Following the events of July 13, 2024, President Joe Biden directed the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to conduct an independent security review of the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump. Today, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas is naming a bipartisan panel with extensive law enforcement and security experience to conduct a 45-day independent review of the planning for and actions taken by the U.S. Secret Service and state and local authorities before, during, and after the rally, and the U.S. Secret Service governing policies and procedures.\n\nThe independent review panel of experts from outside of government will be comprised of former DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano; Ms. Frances Townsend, former Homeland Security Advisor to President George W. Bush; the Hon. Mark Filip, a former federal judge and Deputy Attorney General to President George W. Bush; and Chief David Mitchell, the former superintendent of Maryland State Police and former Secretary of the Department of Public Safety and Homeland Security for the State of Delaware. Secretary Mayorkas could invite additional experts to join the panel in the coming days.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to getting to the bottom of what happened on July 13, and I am grateful to the distinguished members of this independent review who will bring decades of expertise in law enforcement and security operations to this important investigation,\u201d said Secretary Alejandro N. Mayorkas. \u201cEnsuring the safety and security of current and former Presidents is critical and one of our Department\u2019s top priorities. The men and women of the Secret Service make it the greatest protective service in the world, with one of the most solemn and difficult missions in government. This independent review will examine what happened and provide actionable recommendations to ensure they carry out their no-fail mission most effectively and to prevent something like this from ever happening again.\u201d\n\nAs the President announced on July 14, the Administration is committed to sharing the results of this review with the American people. Secretary Mayorkas has also encouraged the panel members to notify him of recommendations that require immediate attention in real time, so changes can be quickly implemented if needed. The independent review will be conducted in such a way as to not interfere with the FBI\u2019s ongoing criminal investigation or any other criminal investigation.\n\nThe bipartisan panel brings to the investigation expertise in law enforcement, protective security, and homeland security at the local, state, and federal level. As Secretary of Homeland Security from 2009 to 2013, Janet Napolitano led the nation\u2019s efforts to prevent terrorist attacks, secure its borders, respond to natural disasters, and build domestic resiliency. She oversaw the U.S. Secret Service and also led critical enhancements to aviation security, including initiatives like the creation of TSA Pre\u2713\u00ae that bolster security while improving the travel experience and the expansion of programs like Global Entry and pre-clearance. She was the first woman and is to date the longest-serving Secretary of Homeland Security. She previously served as the twentieth president of the University of California, from 2013 to 2020 and governor of Arizona from 2003-2009. She is currently the founder of the Center for Security in Politics and Professor of Public Policy at the Goldman School of Public Policy at UC Berkeley.\n\nMs. Frances Townsend served as Assistant to President George W. Bush for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism from 2004 to 2008 and chaired the Homeland Security Council. She also served as Deputy National Security Advisor for Combatting Terrorism from May 2003 to May 2004. Ms. Townsend previously spent 13 years at the U.S. Department of Justice under the administrations of President George H. W. Bush, President Bill Clinton, and President George W. Bush. Ms. Townsend served on the Director of National Intelligence\u2019s Senior Advisory Group, the Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s External Advisory Board and the U.S. President\u2019s Intelligence Advisory Board.\n\nThe Hon. Mark Filip served as Deputy Attorney General from 2008-2009, overseeing the Department of Justice\u2019s criminal and civil enforcement efforts. He previously served as a federal court judge in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois after unanimous, bipartisan confirmation by the U.S. Senate following his nomination by President George W. Bush in 2003. In 2014, Mr. Filip served on the panel tasked with reviewing and recommending reforms to the United States Secret Service Protective Mission. Mr. Filip is currently a partner at the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis LLP, where he is a member of the firm\u2019s global management committee.\n\nChief David B. Mitchell brings four decades of law enforcement experience to this review. From 1990 to 1995, he served as Chief of Police for Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, prior to being appointed Superintendent of the Maryland State Police, the seventh largest state police department in the nation. He led the force during the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and the D.C. sniper case in 2003. In 2004, he was appointed Secretary of the Department of Safety and Homeland Security for the State of Delaware. He currently serves as the Director of Public Safety and Chief of Police for the University of Maryland, College Park Campus.\n\n\u201cAll Americans share a concern about the safety of our public officials,\u201d said the members of the independent review panel in a joint statement. \u201cWe formed this bipartisan group to quickly identify improvements the U.S. Secret Service can implement to enhance their work. We must all work together to ensure events like July 13 do not happen again.\u201d\n\nIn response to the ongoing heightened threat environment, the Secret Service enhanced former President Trump\u2019s protection prior to the assassination attempt in July, and since July 16, the U.S. Secret Service made significant physical and technical enhancements related to securing the former President and other protectees.\n\nFor up to date information about the independent review, please visit DHS.gov/independent-review-2024-attempted-assassination.\n\n###",

But on Sunday he said he had changed his mind.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as president for the remainder of my term,\" he wrote in a letter addressed to \"my fellow Americans\" posted on social media.\n\nHe followed up with a post endorsing Vice President Harris as nominee, and urged his party to come together.\n\nHis decision comes just a month ahead the party\u2019s convention. But the path ahead to Nov. 5 is unclear, and it will be difficult for the party to get organized on time.\n\nNot since March 1968 has an incumbent U.S. president opted out of running for a second term \u2014 when President Lyndon B. Johnson, under pressure over the Vietnam War, dropped out of the presidential race during a live television address.\n\ntoggle caption Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images/AFP\n\nA fumbled debate touched off Democratic panic\n\nPolls have long shown that most voters disapproved of Biden's performance and thought he was too old for the job. But Biden\u2019s campaign team had argued that support would pick up once voters had the chance to think about former President Donald Trump\u2019s positions on abortion rights and his role in the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign thought the debate against Trump would kickstart this contrast. Scheduled months earlier than usual and with new rules, including no live audience and muted candidate microphones unless directed to speak, the debate was largely held on Biden\u2019s terms.\n\nThe goal was to send a clear message to Biden\u2019s doubters: that he could swat away concerns about his age by showing off his first-term record and decades-long political tenure.\n\nInstead, the president spoke with a noticeably raspy voice, seemed overwhelmed at times, and failed to make concise and clear points on a number of issues key to his reelection platform, notably protecting abortion access.\n\nThe performance sent Democrats into a panic, and prompted a steady drip of private and public calls for Biden to step back from the campaign and make way for a new candidate.\n\ntoggle caption Allison Joyce/Getty Images/Getty Images North America\n\nBiden's damage control tour\n\nBiden was defiant, saying his health was fine, and arguing that he was the most experienced and best-placed candidate to beat Trump.\n\nHe told ABC's George Stephanopoulos that only the \"Lord Almighty\" could make him drop out of the race, and privately met with Democratic lawmakers, governors, and donors to make his case.\n\nBiden publicly railed against the \"elites\" in his party. \"I don't care what those 'big names' think. They were wrong in 2020, they were wrong in 2022 about the red wave. They're wrong in 2024,\" Biden said on MSNBC's Morning Joe on July 8.\n\n\"Go ahead. Announce for president. Challenge me at the convention,\" he said.\n\ntoggle caption Kent Nishimura/AFP via Getty Images/AFP\n\nBiden did a series of campaign stops and speeches in key states, giving fiery speeches to try to demonstrate that he \"just had a bad night\" at the debate. He gave a lengthy solo press conference, and sat for televised interviews.\n\nHe wheeled out new attack lines on Trump in a retooled stump speech \u2014 only to have to immediately scale back his rhetoric in the wake of an assassination attempt on Trump. As Republicans gathered at their national convention, he tried to campaign in Nevada to create some counterprogramming \u2014 then got COVID, sending him into isolation in Delaware.\n\n\"We can't catch a break,\" a Biden adviser told NPR on the day that Trump gave his acceptance speech at the Republican convention.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nParty leaders conveyed concern that Biden would lose to Trump, and weigh on tough Senate and House races. Rep. Jamie Raskin told him he was like Red Sox pitcher Pedro Martinez, who in 2003, stayed in the game too long.\n\n\u201cThere is no shame in taking a well-deserved bow to the overflowing appreciation of the crowd when your arm is tired out, and there is real danger for the team in ignoring the statistics,\" Raskin warned.\n\ntoggle caption Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images/AFP\n\nNow, the race begins to replace Biden on the ticket\n\nBack in 2020, when Biden was running to become the Democratic presidential candidate, he had called himself a \"bridge\" to younger stars in his party as he campaigned with Harris, Whitmer and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J.\n\n\"There's an entire generation of leaders you saw stand behind me. They are the future of this country,\" he said.\n\nIn the waning days of his campaign, Biden was asked why he hadn't taken the opportunity to pass the torch earlier.\n\n\"What changed was the gravity of the situation I inherited in terms of the economy, our foreign policy, and domestic division,\" Biden said.\n\n\"I realized ... my long time in the Senate had equipped me to have the wisdom to know how to deal with the Congress to get things done,\" he said. \"And I want to finish it -- to get that finished.\"\n\ntoggle caption Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images/Getty Images North America\n\nBut instead, Democrats are now under intense pressure to choose an alternate candidate in an extremely compressed time period that one Biden adviser said may be like the \"Hunger Games.\"\n\n\"What campaign team is going to rise from the ashes?\" the adviser asked. \u201cIt's gonna be ugly. It's gonna be dirty. It's gonna be messy.\u201d\n\nVice President Harris, 59, is expected to be a frontrunner \u2014 and Biden endorsed her. Other leaders have called for an open nomination process. But in the hours after the announcement, a flood of elected Democrats also threw their support behind her, including some of the governors who were thought to be potential competitors.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAlmost immediately, the Biden-Harris campaign was renamed \"Harris for President,\" and in the first five hours of her new presidential campaign, ActBlue said small-dollar donors contributed more than $27 million.\n\nLoading...\n\nNPR political reporter Elena Moore contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Biden Drops Out of Race, Scrambling the Campaign for the White House\nPresident Biden on Sunday abruptly abandoned his campaign for a second term under intense pressure from fellow Democrats and threw his support to Vice President Kamala Harris to lead their party in a dramatic last-minute bid to stop former President Donald J. Trump from returning to the White House.\n\n\u201cIt has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,\u201d Mr. Biden said in a letter posted on social media. \u201cAnd while it has been my intention to seek re-election, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.\u201d\n\nMr. Biden then posted a subsequent online message endorsing Ms. Harris. \u201cMy very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd it\u2019s been the best decision I\u2019ve made. Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats \u2014 it\u2019s time to come together and beat Trump. Let\u2019s do this.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s decision upended the race and set the stage for a raucous and unpredictable campaign unlike any in modern times, leaving Ms. Harris just 107 days to consolidate support from Democrats, establish herself as a credible national leader and prosecute the case against Mr. Trump. Recent polls have shown her competitive with and even slightly ahead of Mr. Trump.",

        "text": "Biden announces he is dropping out of 2024 U.S. Presidential election\nWASHINGTON, DC \u2014 On Sunday, President Joe Biden released a statement announcing that he is going to \"stand down\" in the 2024 Presidential election.\n\nIn a statement released on social media, President Biden says that while it has \"been [his] intention to see re-election, [he] believes it is in the best interest of my party and the country for [him] to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling [his] duties as President for the remainder of [his] term.\"\n\nFor weeks, President Joe Biden ignored calls from Democrats in Congress to drop out of the Presidential race. Arizona Congressmen Raul Grijalva and Greg Stanton were among the first to ask the President to step aside.\n\nWatch ABC Special Report coverage on the Democratic race:\n\nBiden dismissed his poor debate performance in June as a one-off, blaming the product of a lingering cold and fatigue.\n\nRegardless, his poll numbers continued to slip and, fearing he may hurt Democrats in down-ballot races in November, party leaders and donors joined in on urging him to step aside.\n\nBiden turned a deaf ear to those calls.\n\nOn Friday, his campaign announced that the President is anxious to return to the campaign trail next week after he recovers from COVID-19. Prior to the diagnosis, Biden sat down for interviews with ABC and NBC News, held an hour-long press conference following the NATO Summit, and attended campaign events before receptive audiences in Wisconsin, Michigan and Nevada.\n\nOn the road, the President often doubled down, telling a crowd in Wisconsin, \u201cI\u2019m staying in the race\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m in it to win it.\u201d\n\nBut the calls to end his campaign only grew louder.\n\nIt is a rarity in history to force a President to either leave office or, in this case, to not seek re-election. But it has happened.\n\nOn Aug. 7, 1974, John Rhodes, an Arizona Republican who was the minority leader of the House of Representatives, joined Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater and Senate Minority Leader Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania in telling President Richard Nixon his attempts to survive Watergate were pointless.\n\nTwo days later, Nixon resigned.\n\nFor Biden, his insistence on remaining at the top of the ticket was eventually drowned out by those who said no. Now that the terms of surrender are hashed out, the Democrats move on and hope there is still enough time to defeat Donald Trump.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump officially secured the Republican presidential nomination at the Republican National Convention, days after he was injured in an assassination attempt at a campaign rally. It\u2019s unclear who the Democratic nominee will be upon Biden\u2019s exit from the race.",

        "text": "Presidential predictor Allan Lichtman tells Democrats after Biden drops out: 'Get smart and unite'\nIt was a historic day as President Joe Biden announced that he was dropping his bid for re-election and throwing his support to Vice President Kamala Harris for the Democratic party\u2019s 2024 presidential nominee.\n\nThe abrupt announcement made in a social media post Sunday afternoon thrust the party into a pit of chaos and speculation. But presidential election predictor Allan Lichtman \u2013 who has correctly predicted the winner of nearly every U.S. presidential race since 1984 \u2013 says there's still a way forward for Democrats despite the tumult.\n\nLichtman's predictions use a system he developed called \"The 13 Keys to the White House\" to determine the outcome of the elections.\n\n\"The keys gauge the strength and performance of the White House party,\" Lichtman told FOX 5 Sunday.\n\nHe describes the \"Keys\u2019\" as a \"vote up or down on the strength and performance of the White House party.\"\n\n\"And if six or more of the keys go against them, they are predicted to be the losers,\" he says. Here are Lichtman's 13 Keys:\n\nKEY 1 (Party Mandate)\n\nKEY 2 (Contest)\n\nKEY 3 (Incumbency)\n\nKEY 4 (Third Party)\n\nKEY 5 (Short-Term Economy)\n\nKEY 6 (Long-Term Economy)\n\nKEY 7 (Policy Change)\n\nKEY 8 (Social Unrest)\n\nKEY 9 (Scandal)\n\nKEY 10 (Foreign/Military Failure)\n\nKEY 11 (Foreign/Military Success)\n\nKEY 12 (Incumbent Charisma)\n\nKEY 13 (Challenger Charisma)\n\n\"With Biden dropping out, they [Democrats] lose one more key: the incumbency key,\" Lichtman said. \"But they can still preserve another key: the contest key if, finally, the Democrats get smart and unite behind Kamala Harris as the consensus nominee, they keep that key in line.\"\n\nLichtman says so far, it appears that's exactly what the Democratic Party is doing but there is still some speculation about whether all the party members are going to fall in line.\n\nIt won't take long to find out though. The real test of the party's unity will come at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next month.\n\nLitchman says when some of those questions are answered, he'll be able to make a final prediction.\n\n\"There are four shaky keys that I haven't decided and I haven't made a final prediction yet. They are third party, social unrest and foreign/military failure and success. Provided Harris becomes the consensus nominee, three of those four keys would have to fall to predict the Democrat's defeat,\" Lichtman said. \"If she doesn't become the consensus nominee, only two would have to fall.\"",

        "text": "2024 United States presidential election in Utah\nThe 2024 United States presidential election in Utah took place on Tuesday, November 5, 2024, as part of the 2024 United States presidential election in which all 50 states plus the District of Columbia will participate. Utah voters chose electors to represent them in the Electoral College via a popular vote. The state of Utah has six electoral votes in the Electoral College, following reapportionment due to the 2020 United States census in which the state neither gained nor lost a seat.[1]\n\nIncumbent Democratic president Joe Biden initially ran for reelection to a second term, but dropped out of the race prior to the Democratic National Convention.[2] Former President Donald Trump ran for reelection to a second non-consecutive term after losing to Biden in 2020.[3] Robert F. Kennedy Jr. gathered the required signatures to qualify for the ballot in early-January but would later withdraw.[4]\n\nA Mountain West state, Utah has not been won by a Democratic presidential candidate since Lyndon B. Johnson in his 1964 landslide and is a strongly red state, a trait vastly owed to the state's conservative Mormon base. As expected, Donald Trump won the state handily\u2014though with only a 1.1% Republican swing, Utah proved to have one of the smallest rightward shifts in the nation.[5] Trump became the first Republican to win the White House without carrying Grand County since William McKinley in 1900.\n\nPrimary elections [ edit ]\n\nDemocratic primary [ edit ]\n\nThe Utah Democratic primary was held on Super Tuesday, March 5, 2024. Incumbent president Joe Biden easily won the state, facing minor opposition from activist Marianne Williamson and Congressman Dean Phillips.\n\nPopular vote share by county Biden 70\u201380%\n\n80\u201390%\n\n>90%\n\nUtah Democratic primary, March 5, 2024 [ 6 ] Candidate Votes Percentage Actual delegate count Pledged Unpledged Total Joe Biden (incumbent) 58,872 86.9% 30 Marianne Williamson 3,521 5.2% Dean Phillips 3,024 4.5% Gabriel Cornejo 1,503 2.2% Frankie Lozada 859 1.3% Total: 67,779 100% 34 34\n\nRepublican primary [ edit ]\n\nThe Utah Republican caucuses were held on Super Tuesday, March 5, 2024. Former president Donald Trump defeated former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley in one of his weakest performances of the greater Republican primaries. The state GOP returned to organizing a caucus after its use of the primary system in 2020, which significantly lowered turnout.\n\nPopular vote share by county Trump 50\u201360%\n\n60\u201370%\n\n70\u201380%\n\n80\u201390%\n\n>90% Haley 50\u201360%\n\nUtah Republican caucus, March 5, 2024 [ 7 ] Candidate Votes Percentage Actual delegate count Bound Unbound Total Donald Trump 48,350 56.35% 40 40 Nikki Haley 36,621 42.68% Ryan Binkley (withdrawn) 826 0.96% Total: 85,797 100.00% 40 40\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral election [ edit ]\n\nPredictions [ edit ]\n\nAs of August 2024, the following candidates have been designated as \"Election Candidates\":[18]\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. lawsuit [ edit ]\n\nOn December 5, 2023, independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. filed a lawsuit against lieutenant governor Deidre Henderson and state elections director Ryan Cowley, arguing that the state's requirement for unaffiliated candidates to attain 1,000 verified signatures before the January 8 deadline is unconstitutional and that it forces Kennedy's campaign to hire professional petition circulators. In the 2020 election, the filing deadline was August 17, and was moved up in a bill passed by the Utah State Legislature in February 2022. Campaign lawyer Paul Rossi argued that the deadline was made \"to block any third-party candidates from appearing on Utah's ballot,\" showing \"an absolute contempt for the Constitution.\"[19] A court filing was made by state attorney general Sean Reyes on December 7, stating that Henderson and Cowley have agreed to not enforce the deadline until March 5, 2024, per request of senior judge David Nuffer.[20] Kennedy later qualified to appear on the Utah ballot on December 28, 2023, marking the first state to award him official ballot access.[21] Kennedy would later withdraw from the ballot in Utah after the suspension of his campaign and endorse Donald Trump for President.[18]\n\nPolling [ edit ]\n\nDonald Trump vs. Kamala Harris\n\nDonald Trump vs. Kamala Harris vs. Cornel West vs. Jill Stein vs. Chase Oliver\n\nResults [ edit ]\n\n2024 United States presidential election in Utah [ 33 ] Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 1,488,469 100.00%\n\nBy county [ edit ]\n\nSwing by county: Democratic \u2014 +2.5-5% Democratic \u2014 +0-2.5% Republican \u2014 +0-2.5% Republican \u2014 +2.5-5% Republican \u2014 +5-7.5% Republican \u2014 +7.5-10% Republican \u2014 +10-12.5%\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nNotes [ edit ]\n\nPartisan clients",

Her mixed record might make it an uphill battle\nHours after Joe Biden made the stunning decision to end his bid for re-election, U.S. Vice-President Kamala Harris \u2014 with Biden's endorsement \u2014 announced that she is running for president in the 2024 general election against Donald Trump.\n\nHarris, a former prosecutor and California senator who first ran for president in 2020 before she was picked as Biden's running mate, said she was \"honoured to have the president's endorsement.\"\n\n\"My intention is to earn and win this nomination,\" she wrote in a statement.\n\nHarris is not guaranteed the nomination until she is voted in by delegates during the Democratic National Convention next month in Chicago.\n\nDuring a White House event honouring college athletes on Monday, Harris made her first public appearance since Biden's endorsement, calling his presidential legacy \"unmatched in modern history.\"\n\nWATCH | Harris praises Biden's legacy at White House event: Kamala Harris: Biden's legacy is \u2018unmatched\u2019 Duration 0:42 U.S. Vice-President Kamala Harris delivered remarks for the first time since President Joe Biden stepped down from the presidential race at an event for the National Collegiate Athletics Association. Harris said Biden\u2019s legacy is \u2018unmatched in modern history.\u2019\n\n\"Every day, our president, Joe Biden, fights for the American people, and we are deeply, deeply grateful for his service to our nation,\" Harris said, though she did not specifically refer to her own campaign.\n\nIf elected, Harris's presidency would be historic, making her the first woman, first Black woman and first South Asian to serve as president.\n\nShe's led the Biden administration's response on key issues, including immigration, voting rights and abortion.\n\nBut she has an uphill battle ahead, having struggled with public image issues and poor polling throughout her vice-presidency.\n\nWhat she achieved, how she was criticized\n\nHarris, the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants, first ran for president in 2020 after serving in the U.S. Senate and as attorney general of California. Her presidential campaign faltered early due to low polling and messaging issues, leading her to drop out of the race before the primaries began.\n\nThose issues bled into her first year as vice-president, amid a growing perception that she had been cast aside by the Biden administration that year \u2014 to the point that White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre released a statement stressing that Harris was a \"vital partner\" to Biden.\n\nHarris was further challenged by early turnover among her staff. The Washington Post called it an \"exodus,\" and a Politico investigation found that aides and senior officials were \"experiencing low morale, porous lines of communication and diminished trust.\"\n\nWATCH | How will Harris handle Trump \u2014 and vice-versa?: Joe Biden endorses Kamala Harris. How would she fare against Donald Trump? Duration 18:45 U.S. President Joe Biden has thrown his support behind Vice-President Kamala Harris after ending his re-election campaign on Sunday. Political science professor Chris Galdieri reacts to Biden\u2019s backing of Harris, while Republican strategist Chip Felkel looks at how she stacks up against Trump.\n\nEarly into her tenure, Harris was appointed by the Biden administration to lead its immigration response at the southern U.S.-Mexico border and was tasked with exploring the root cause of mass migration from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.\n\nOne of her most significant achievements came when she secured $4.2 billion US in private-sector investments for job creation and economic development in Central America.\n\nThe initiative was meant to quell the flow of migrants out of those countries and into the U.S., and the administration has said that it's on track to reach its goals in the region.\n\nWATCH | Who should be her running mate? Democrats face 'headwinds' in Midwest Duration 2:20 Kamala Harris should pick a centrist running mate who can help her overcome some of the 'significant headwinds' that Democrats face in battleground states, most notably in the Midwest, says Democratic strategist Brett Bruen. The party must win back voters 'who are sitting in the middle, sitting on the fence,' he said.\n\nPoliticians on both sides of the aisle criticized Harris for delaying a trip to the Mexican border, and conservatives called her a failed \"border czar\" who had dropped the ball as the humanitarian crisis at the border intensified.\n\nAnother key issue in Harris's vice-presidential portfolio is abortion rights, for which she became an especially outspoken advocate after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022.\n\nAt the beginning of this year, she launched a \"fight for reproductive freedoms\" tour pushing for further access to abortion across the country, while mobilizing voters on abortion issues ahead of the election.\n\nHarris has also been outspoken on lowering prescription drug costs and promoting gun reform, and has led efforts to legislate voting rights protections. A legislative victory on the latter file was ultimately stalled when two Senate Democrats withheld their support.\n\nHarris, shown at Nashville's Fisk University in April 2023, would make history if elected as the first woman, first Black woman and first South Asian to serve as U.S. president. (George Walker IV/The Associated Press)\n\nSome polling has shown Harris might be a stronger matchup against Trump, the Republican candidate, than Biden was. Another poll has shown that most Democrats think she would make a good president, with about six in 10 saying they believe Harris would do a good job as president. Two in 10 say they don't believe she would, and another two in 10 said they don't know enough to respond.\n\nIn that same poll, there was broader skepticism among Americans regardless of party. Only three in 10 U.S. adults said Harris would do well in the top job. Her favourability rating is similar to Biden's, but the share of voters who have an unfavourable opinion of her is lower.\n\nThe poll of 1,253 adults was conducted July 11-15, 2024, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.\n\nA growing chorus of support, an influx of cash\n\nHarris has been endorsed by a majority of Democrats in Congress and by most Democratic governors, including, as of Monday afternoon, former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine.\n\nShe has also received endorsements from the Congressional Black Caucus, the Latino Victory Fund and the Human Rights Campaign, as well as from former U.S. president Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state.\n\nNotably, former president Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, have not endorsed Harris. Obama similarly held off on endorsing Biden during his 2020 election run, doing so only after Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders dropped out of the race for the Democratic nomination.\n\nAs endorsements rolled in, Harris's announcement was met with an influx of cash from Democratic donors. The New York Times reported on Monday that in less than 24 hours, she had raised more than $50 million US while ActBlue \u2014 a donation portal used by the Democrats \u2014 had processed more than $80 million after Biden's announcement that he would step down.\n\nPolls suggests Harris might be stronger than U.S. President Joe Biden in an election campaign against former U.S. president Donald Trump, right. (LM Otero, Evan Vucci/The Associated Press)\n\nA lot of Democrats are increasingly realizing \"that Vice-President Kamala Harris is probably the simplest and most straightforward alternative to Biden,\" said Chris Galdieri, a political science professor at Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire. \"It's literally her job to step in if Biden is not able to do the job.\"\n\nThere is also the question of who her running mate will be, assuming that she is the nominee. While Harris might appeal to Black and female voters, she will have less of a hold on important swing voter states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\nShe'll likely choose a candidate who can move the needle in regions where the Democrats are struggling.\n\n\"Will it be somebody who can appeal to those Midwestern industrial states?\" Galdieri said.\n\n\"Will she look for somebody who can help Democrats in the southwest, where they've made inroads into places like Nevada and Arizona in the last few years? Or will she go for somebody who can help in the south?\"\n\nWATCH | Kamala Harris's little-known ties to Montreal: Kamala Harris keeps quiet about Canadian ties Duration 2:00 U.S. vice-presidential candidate Kamala Harris has significant ties to Canada, but it\u2019s not something she talks about much. Her mother brought Harris and her sister to Montreal in the 1970s, and she even graduated from Westmount High School.\n\nHaving spent four years working in the White House, Harris is probably best suited to articulate the case for the Biden administration's record and argue that she can continue their work in another term, he said.\n\nBiden's support had been lagging among Black voters, who have shown less enthusiasm for him during this campaign than they had during his initial 2020 run. Harris, by contrast, polls favourably among Black voters and will likely prove more popular among female voters, Galdieri said.\n\n\"I think for the Democrats to pass over the first woman vice-president, the first Black woman to serve as vice-president, would provoke a major rift with Black voters, particularly Black women who have become such an important bedrock constituency for the Democratic Party in recent years.\"",

        "text": "Biden Drops Out Of 2024 Race\u2014Here\u2019s What Happens Next\nTopline\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced Sunday he will end his 2024 presidential campaign and endorse Vice President Kamala Harris as his replacement, saying he believes \u201cit is in the best interest of my party and the country to stand down.\u201d (Read Joe Biden\u2019s full letter ending his campaign here.)\n\nBLUE BELL, PENNSYLVANIA - JANUARY 5: U.S. President Joe Biden speaks during a campaign event at ... [+] Montgomery County Community College January 5, 2024 in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania. In his first campaign event of the 2024 election season, Biden stated that democracy and fundamental freedoms are under threat if former U.S. President Donald Trump returns to the White House. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) Getty Images\n\nKey Facts\n\nThe president made the announcement in a letter, saying he intends \u201cto focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.\u201d He endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris shortly after releasing the letter, saying he gives Harris his \"full support\" and calling his choice to pick her as his 2020 running mate the \"best decision I\u2019ve made.\" Biden stepped down after more than three dozen Democrats in Congress urged him to do so, and after a flurry of reports that Democratic leaders in Congress were working behind the scenes to push Biden to end his bid. Biden has faced questions for months about whether he is too old to serve another term, but the party largely stood behind him until his disastrous June 27 debate performance, when Biden often appeared bewildered, gave disjointed answers and spoke in a soft, raspy voice\u2014leading to an onslaught of backlash from pundits, major newspapers, celebrities, donors and elected Democrats. Biden\u2019s decision to leave the race at this stage in the election cycle is unprecedented in modern politics and sets up a mad dash to choose his replacement, just weeks before the party is set to formally choose its nominee in a virtual roll call the first week of August.\n\nWhen Will A New Nominee Be Chosen?\n\nDemocrats plan to hold a virtual roll call to formally select their nominee as soon as Aug. 1 and before Aug. 7, ahead of the party\u2019s Aug. 19 convention. The party initially planned the early roll call to ensure Biden would be on the ballot in Ohio, which previously required nominees to be confirmed 90 days before the election. Ohio has since revised its law, but it doesn\u2019t take effect until Sept. 1, so Democrats have said they will move forward with the early nomination anyway.\n\nHow Will Democrats Replace Biden?\n\nThe approximately 4,700 Democratic delegates will choose a new candidate by majority vote. About 4,000 delegates are \u201cpledged\u201d to Biden, but by stepping down, he effectively releases them from their obligation to vote for him. The 700 \u201cunpledged\u201d delegates\u2014also known as superdelegates and can vote for whoever they please\u2014are allowed to vote in a second round if a candidate does not secure the majority votes needed to win in the first round.\n\nWhat Is An Open Convention?\n\nAn open convention would occur if multiple candidates are presented to delegates at the convention, and Biden hasn\u2019t endorsed a replacement, leaving his delegates free to vote for anyone.\n\nWhat Is A \u2018mini-Primary\u2019?\n\nThe process of choosing a new nominee isn\u2019t exactly clear, but some have floated a \u201cmini primary\u201d involving a series of campaign events\u2014such as debates, high-profile interviews or town halls\u2014between potential Biden replacements prior to delegates casting their votes. Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., has said he would support Harris as the nominee if Biden dropped out and the party coalesced around her, but he has also suggested Democrats could conduct a \u201cmini primary\u201d to survey other candidates, an idea New York Times columnist Ezra Klein and longtime Democratic political consultant James Carville also endorsed.\n\nWho Are The Top Contenders To Replace Biden?\n\nHarris is the top contender, but other names commonly floated include California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro. Previous Democratic presidential candidates Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Sens. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., are also among the potential contenders. No Democrats who have been seriously floated as potential replacements have said they\u2019re interested in the 2024 nomination.\n\nHow Is Kamala Harris Polling?\n\nSimilar to Biden and slightly better than all other potential replacements surveyed, but still worse than Trump, according to most surveys. A mid-July YouGov poll (margin of error 3.1) found Biden would lose to Trump by two points and Harris would lose by three, while a Reuters/Ipsos poll found both Biden and Harris are virtually statistically tied with Trump. In a CNN/SSRS poll (margin of error 3.5) conducted days after the debate, Harris outperformed Biden, and three other potential candidates commonly floated to replace him, in a hypothetical matchup against Trump\u2014but she would still lose to the former president by two points (while Biden would lose to Trump by six points).\n\nWhat Do Supporters\u2014and Critics\u2014say About Harris?\n\nSeveral prominent Democrats explicitly mentioned Harris as the most viable option to replace Biden prior to him announcing his resignation from the race. Clyburn has said he believes Harris would do \u201cvery well\u201d at the top of the ticket and the party should do everything it can to \u201cbolster\u201d her would-be candidacy. Harris has downsides, however, including a relatively low approval rating (though it\u2019s likely a direct reflection of Biden\u2019s own low approval rating) and a series of negative stories about her job performance as vice president, including that she\u2019s been largely absent from the public eye. Her record as a state and local prosecutor has also drawn ire from some progressives who have accused her of not doing enough to investigate police misconduct and have pointed out her history of prosecuting marijuana-related offenses. Harris\u2019 views on criminal justice seem to have evolved however, as she\u2019s endorsed Biden\u2019s pardoning of federal marijuana-related convictions and she has spoken out against the notion that putting more police in the streets increases public safety. Former Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, slammed Harris\u2019 detractors in endorsing her to replace Biden in a recent Newsweek op-ed, calling her \u201ca joy to hang out with . . . brilliant, compassionate, engaging, funny and totally down to earth.\u201d Harris, he said, \u201ccan energize the electorate and govern effectively.\u201d\n\nWhat Was Trump\u2019s Reaction?\n\nFormer President Donald Trump blasted Biden in a Truth Social post following the announcement, saying \u201cCrooked Joe Biden was not fit to run for President, and is certainly not fit to serve - And never was!\u201d",

        "text": "The Last Time an American Political Party Declined to Nominate Their Incumbent President for Reelection\nWith the news that President Joe Biden is dropping out of the presidential race, the 2024 election cycle is entering uncharted territory.\n\nWhile many questions remain about who will replace Biden on the Democratic party ticket, this isn't the first time in history that an incumbent president lost their party's nomination while they were running for reelection. (Though Biden framed this decision as his choice, it was clearly at the pressure of the Democratic caucus and polls showing the opinions of voters.)\n\nThe only other elected president to lose their party's nomination was President Franklin Pierce, back in 1856, while other incumbents (like Calvin Coolidge and Lyndon B. Johnson) have decided not to seek reelection. And, in the 19th century, four separate presidents\u2014all who became president following the death or assassination of the incumbent\u2014did not win their party's nomination, losing during the convention.\n\nHere, a brief history of the other times incumbent presidents lost their party's nomination.\n\nThe only other elected president to lose his party's nomination: Franklin Pierce\n\nHeritage Images // Getty Images Pierce, November 1852.\n\nIn 1856, Franklin Pierce, the 14th president of the U.S., was running for re-election. But Pierce's position against the abolitionist movement, his enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act, and the fact that he signed into law the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854\u2014which repealed the Missouri Compromise and left open the question of slavery in new territories\u2014made him unpopular among his own Democratic Party.\n\nAt the 1856 Democratic National Convention, delegates ditched Pierce and instead nominated former Secretary of State James Buchanan. Pierce ultimately endorsed Buchanan, who won the election and served as the 15th president from 1857 to 1861. Pierce was the first (and until Biden, the only) elected incumbent president who was did not get his party's nomination for a second term.\n\nOther incumbent presidents that also lost their party's nomination\n\nPrint Collector // Getty Images Andrew Johnson, 17th President of the United States, was Abraham Lincoln\u2019s vice-president and succeeded Lincoln as president after his assassination.\n\nThroughout U.S. history, four other incumbent presidents lost their party's nomination, but none of them were elected for their first term\u2014all became president following the death the incumbent president. They are, in chronological order:\n\nJohn Tyler, who became the 10th president in 1841 upon the death of William Henry Harrison, was expelled from the Whig party just a few months later. Therefore, he wasn't eligible to earn the Whig party nomination in 1844, which instead nominated Henry Clay. Clay would go on to lose to the Democratic nominee, James K. Polk.\n\nMillard Filmore, the 13th president, ascended to the president upon the death of Zachary Taylor in 1850. At the 1852 Whig National Convention, Taylor, whose enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act was unpopular with Northerners, lost the nomination to General-in-Chief Winfield Scott. Scott lost the 1852 election to Franklin Pierce (above), who would go on to lose his own party's nomination four years later.\n\nAndrew Johnson, the 17th president, took the office of president in 1865 upon the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln, a Republican, had selected Johnson, a Southern Democrat, to run on a unity ticket in 1864. So during the 1868 election, Johnson tried to earn the Democratic nomination but lost to Horatio Seymour, the former Governor of New York. Seymour lost in the general election to Ulysses S. Grant.\n\nChester Arthur, the 21st president, succeeded to the presidency after the assassination of James Garfield in 1881. Arthur was unsuccessful in clinching the Republican nominee for a second term, losing to Secretary of State James G. Blaine. Blaine would lose in the general election to Grover Cleveland.\n\nRelated Story A History of Presidential Assassination Attempts\n\nIncumbent presidents who decided not to run for reelection\n\nBettmann President Lyndon Johnson during a nationwide television broadcast wherein he announced would not be seeking re-election, March 1968.\n\nBiden technically also falls into the category of incumbents who decided not to seek a second term, though he initially did try to get reelected. There have been seven other elected incumbents in American history who didn't seek a second term: James K. Polk (in 1848), James Buchanan (in 1860), Rutherford B. Hayes (in 1880), Calvin Coolidge (in 1928), Harry S. Truman (in 1952), and Lyndon B. Johnson (in 1968).\n\nCoolidge, Truman, and Johnson all served more than four years, but they were still eligible to run again; Coolidge became president upon the death of Warren G. Harding in 1923, Truman succeeded to the presidency upon the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1945, and Johnson took office upon the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963.",

        "text": "Biden drops out of presidential race, endorses Harris\nA man holds a sign showing his appreciation for US President Joe Biden along Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House in Washington, DC, on July 21, 2024. SAMUEL CORUM / AFP\n\nUS President Joe Biden announced Sunday, July 21, that he is dropping out of his reelection battle against Donald Trump, in a historic move that plunges the already turbulent 2024 White House race into uncharted territory. Biden endorsed vice president Kamala Harris for the Democratic nomination at the party's August convention in Chicago.\n\n\"While it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,\" Biden said in a letter posted on X.\n\nBiden's decision came as he has been isolating at his Delaware beach house after being diagnosed with Covid-19 last week, huddling with a shrinking circle of close confidants and family members about his political future. Biden said he would address the nation later this week to provide \"detail\" about his decision.\n\nHarris, who is the first female, Black and South Asian vice president in US history, will now be aiming to become its first female commander-in-chief. \"Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year,\" Biden said on X. \"Democrats \u2013 it's time to come together and beat Trump. Let's do this.\" In a statement following the announcement, Kamala Harris praised Joe Biden's \"patriotic\" decision not to seek reelection and vowed to win the Democratic nomination and defeat Donald Trump. \"With this selfless and patriotic act, President Biden is doing what he has done throughout his life of service: putting the American people and our country above everything else.\"\n\nRead more Subscribers only US election: Kamala Harris becomes tempting alternative to Joe Biden\n\nTrump quickly reacted, saying Biden had not been \"fit to run\" or \"fit to serve\" as president.\n\nBiden spent more than three weeks resisting calls to step down following the shock of the June 27 debate, at one point insisting that only the \"Lord Almighty\" could convince him to back out. In a bid to show he was up to the job, he gave a number of interviews and what was billed as a \"big boy\" press conference in which he took numerous questions, but made further gaffes including calling Harris \"Vice President Trump.\"\n\nA tide of voices within his own party calling on him to go, starting with donor and actor George Clooney and ending with former president Barack Obama, sealed his fate.\n\nIsolation\n\nThe end finally came shortly after Biden had been diagnosed with Covid-19, forcing him off the campaign trail and into isolation in Rehoboth Beach. Biden's announcement is the latest jolt to a campaign for the White House that both political parties see as the most consequential election in generations, coming just days after the attempted assassination of Trump at a Pennsylvania rally.\n\nBiden joins a small club of US presidents who have decided to throw in the towel after just one term, with the last being Lyndon Johnson in 1968 \u2013 a year also marked by political turmoil and violence. Johnson's replacement as nominee, then-vice president Hubert Humphrey, went on to lose heavily to Richard Nixon.\n\nBut Democrats are counting on Harris to fare better, and hoping that she can prevent convicted felon Trump from making a sensational comeback to the Oval Office. In recent weeks, the Biden campaign has reportedly been quietly carrying out a head-to-head survey of voters measuring how she matched up against Trump. While Harris struggled to make an impact in her first years in the White House, she has emerged in the last year as a strong performer on the campaign trail on key messages such as abortion rights.\n\nThe former prosecutor has also made much of her life story as the first woman in US history to hold the vice presidency, as well as the first person of Black and South Asian origin. Barring opposition from her party, Harris is now set to be nominated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on August 19 in what promises to be a dramatic moment \u2013 and a heartrending one for Biden.\n\nNo automatic coronation\n\nShortly after President Joe Biden announced Sunday that he would drop his reelection campaign, Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison had a message: There would be no automatic coronation for his replacement. \"In the coming days, the party will undertake a transparent and orderly process to move forward,\" Harrison said in a statement. \"This process will be governed by established rules and procedures of the party. Our delegates are prepared to take seriously their responsibility in swiftly delivering a candidate to the American people.\"\n\nThe comment reflected the reality that while vice president Kamala Harris is emerging as the prohibitive favorite to become the party's nominee is not so simple. Harris has to formally secure the nomination from the around 4,700 Democratic convention delegates. She spent part of Sunday calling elected officials and delegates to solidify their support.\n\nAmong others, endorsements came from Democratic big shots such as Bill and Hillary Clinton; prominent US senators; a wide swath of House representatives (such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez) and members of the influential Congressional Black Caucus; Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, and Arizona Senator Mark Kelly \u2013 each from a swing state and mentioned as a possible running mate for Harris \u2013 endorsed Harris Sunday evening. Shortly followed those seen as potential rivals for the nomination, such as California Governor Gavin Newsom.\n\nWest Virginia Senator Joe Manchin, who left the Democratic Party earlier this year to become an independent, is considering re-registering as a Democrat to vie for the nomination against the vice president, according to a longtime adviser to Manchin. As for the still highly influential former Democratic president Barack Obama, he cautioned that \"uncharted waters\" lay ahead.\n\nThe fast-moving political situation remains volatile just months before the November election.",

        "text": "U.S. Presidential Election 2024: Kamala Harris on AI and Big Tech\nThe U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris is potentially poised to become the Democratic presidential nominee in the November election. As VP, Harris has been particularly outspoken on artificial intelligence (AI). She warned against the \u201cexistential\u201d threat of AI and said it could \u201cendanger the very existence of humanity,\u201d in a November 2023 address.\n\nAlso read | U.S. Presidential Elections 2024 LIVE updates: Joe Biden withdraws from presidential race\n\nIn a meeting with tech execs like Microsoft\u2019s Satya Nadella, OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman and Alphabet\u2019s Sundar Pichai, Harris warned that they have a \u201cmoral\u201d obligation to guard against AI\u2019s possible dangers. She backed an AI executive order from President Joe Biden that sought stronger protections for consumers, singling out AI-generated scam calls and the impacts of unlabelled AI-generated content.\n\nPrior to joining the Biden administration, as California attorney general, Harris sued eBay over the ecommerce company\u2019s anticompetitive hiring practices surrounding a no-poaching agreement with Intuit. The lawsuit led to a nearly $4 million settlement in 2014.\n\nIn a different lawsuit against Houzz, she compelled the startup to hire a chief privacy officer after allegations that the home design app had recorded sales calls without proper notification and consent.\n\n(For top technology news of the day, subscribe to our tech newsletter Today\u2019s Cache)\n\nShe has also been at the forefront of curtailing distribution of pornography on social media, particularly \u201crevenge porn,\u201d a practice involving the posting of explicit photos without the subject\u2019s consent. She took credit for a pressure campaign that led to Facebook, Google, Microsoft and others taking measures to remove certain explicit images.\n\n(with inputs from Reuters)",

        "text": "US election 2024: Where does Kamala Harris stand on regulating big tech and AI?\nUS Presidential Election Results 2024: The 2024 US presidential election is in its eleventh hour with Republican nominee Donald Trump leading with 230 electoral votes while Democrat Kamala Harris trails with 169 votes.\n\nIt is safe to say that incumbent Vice President Harris\u2019 presidential campaign was more future-focused than her opponent, with a clear contrast in the two campaign slogans: Harris\u2019 \u201cwe are not going back\u201d and Trump\u2019s \u201cmake America great again.\u201d\n\nWith the results getting down to the wire, let\u2019s take a look at what a Harris presidency would mean for tech policy in the US and elsewhere.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKamala Harris\u2019 ties with the tech industry\n\nThe presidential hopeful has a long relationship with the tech industry as her roots can be traced back to Silicon Valley, according to a report by TechCrunch. Before entering politics, Harris was San Francisco\u2019s first female district attorney and later, she became California\u2019s first female attorney general, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nDuring her career as a prosecutor, Harris launched a data transparency project called OpenJustice which is a public platform that serves as a record of interactions between law enforcement officials and community members. The dashboard was reportedly built by combining the statistical data of the California Department of Justice with other public datasets.\n\nIn 2016, Harris was elected to the US Senate where she introduced a bill called the Digital Service Act that proposed to provide funds to state and local governments so that they could establish their own tech units.\n\n\n\nIn 2018, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg appeared before the US Senate Judiciary Committee to answer questions about how the tech giant handles users\u2019 private data in the context of the Cambridge Analytica controversy. One of the lawmakers to quiz Zuckerberg was Harris who pointed out that the billionaire CEO had not answered key questions such as, whether Facebook users continue to be tracked even after logging off or if Facebook could access users\u2019 browser histories.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been asked several critical questions for which you don\u2019t have answers,\u201d Harris told Zuckerberg.\n\nWhile Harris was not reluctant to rebuke tech CEOs as a senator, she faced criticism for not doing enough to curb big tech dominance in her role as California\u2019s attorney general. In fact, a Huffington Post report found thousands of emails that reportedly demonstrate Harris\u2019 soft touch approach towards big tech companies.\n\nWhat is Kamala Harris\u2019 approach to AI, tech policy?\n\nWhile she has openly called for more regulation of tech giants such as Meta, Harris has also been hesitant in supporting calls for the breakup of such companies. \u201cI believe that the tech companies have got to be regulated in a way that we can ensure and the American consumer can be certain that their privacy is not being compromised,\u201d she had told The New York Times in a 2020 interview.\n\nInterestingly, Harris does not support banning the popular social media app TikTok in the country. \u201cWe need to deal with the owner, and we have national security concerns about the owner of TikTok, but we have no intention to ban TikTok,\u201d she had said in an interview with ABC News this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarris\u2019 views on cryptocurrency are not very well known; though, she could continue to follow the same regulatory approach as the Biden administration. But she has been fairly vocal when it comes to artificial intelligence (AI), specifically expressing concerns about the more immediate threats that AI poses to society.\n\n\u201cLet us be clear, there are additional threats that also demand our action. Threats that are currently causing harm, and which to many people also feel existential\u2026 when people around the world cannot discern fact from fiction because of a flood of AI enabled myths and disinformation. I ask, is that not existential for democracy?\u201d the 59-year-old vice president had said during the AI safety summit held in the UK last year.\n\nIn 2023, President Biden passed a sweeping executive order that called for companies to set new standards around the development of AI. As part of the Biden administration, Harris also announced new directives for US government agencies that require them to appoint chief AI officers, publish a list of AI systems they use, and ensure that these AI systems do not endanger the rights and safety of the American people.\n\nHarris has reportedly enjoyed the support of several Silicon Valley venture capitalists such as John Doerr and Ron Conway. Since launching her 2024 bid, she has bagged the endorsement of LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman, Netflix chairman Reed Hastings, and billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban, among others.",

At a regular press briefing on Monday, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning declined to comment, and said the \u201cpresidential election is an internal affair of the United States.\u201d\n\nOnline, however, the entry \u201cBiden withdrew from the election\u201d attracted more than 400 million views on the China\u2019s microblogging site Weibo and tens of thousands of comments.\n\nOther topics went viral as well. Topics such as \u201cZelensky respects Biden\u2019s decision to withdraw from the election,\u201d \u201cHarris praised Biden,\u201d and \u201cTrump thinks Harris is easier to beat\u201d were all in the top 20 searches Monday on Weibo, which is similar to the social media site X.\n\nSeveral major media outlets in China, including the state-run Xinhua News Agency, People\u2019s Daily, and the Global Times, covered Biden\u2019s withdrawal from the race extensively.\n\nMany Chinese netizens expressed the view that Biden\u2019s decision ensures that Trump will win the election in November while some said things have suddenly changed for Ukraine, referring to Trump\u2019s repeated criticism of U.S. military aid to Ukraine. \u201cTonight will be a sleepless night for Zelensky,\u201d Chinese netizen \u201cYo-Huai-To-Bi\u201d from northeastern Shandong province wrote on Weibo.\n\nOther Chinese netizens argued that the United States will continue to compete with China and try to contain the country\u2019s rise regardless of who wins the election in November.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be too happy about this news because Trump will likely continue Biden\u2019s strategies toward China and he might roll out harsher measures,\u201d a netizen called \u201cBIGTREE33\u201d from China\u2019s southeastern Fujian Province wrote on Weibo.\n\nSome Chinese commentators said the Democratic Party will have very little chance of winning the presidential election in November without Biden.\n\n\u201cNo faction in the Democratic Party can rebuild a campaign that can challenge Trump within a short time, so after Biden withdrew from the race, the Democrats will return to a very divided situation,\u201d Jia Min, an affiliated researcher at Shanghai Development Research Foundation, told Shanghai Morning News in a video.\n\nHu Xijin, the former editor-in-chief of China\u2019s state-run tabloid Global Times, wrote on X that whoever becomes the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential candidate will make little difference to the presidential race in November.\n\n\u201cBecause Trump\u2019s personality is so outstanding, American voters are now divided into two groups: Trump lovers & Trump haters,\u201d he wrote, adding that November\u2019s election will be a choice between Trump or \u201canyone.\u201d\n\nHarris vs. Trump\n\nAfter Biden endorsed U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris to be the presidential candidate for the Democratic Party and Harris vowed to win the Democratic Party\u2019s nomination, the entry \u201cCould Harris defeat Trump\u201d quickly became a trending topic on Weibo.\n\nMore Chinese netizens seem to believe Harris has very little chance of beating Trump in the presidential election. \u201cIf Hillary Clinton couldn\u2019t beat Trump back then, Harris would just be a joke,\u201d a netizen named \u201cFalling in Love with Jia-tze-hu\u201d from Shandong Province wrote on Weibo.\n\nSome Chinese analysts said Harris lacks the experience and achievement to serve as the next president of the United States.\n\n\u201cLooking at Harris's overall track record, her performance as vice president has not been particularly outstanding, and she has not achieved satisfactory results,\u201d Sun Chenghao, a fellow at the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University, told Chinese online media outlet the Paper.\n\nBeijing-Washington rivalry to continue\n\nWhile Biden\u2019s decision to pull out of the presidential race will likely shape the development of the U.S. presidential election, some analysts say the Chinese government may think that these developments won\u2019t change the fact that Beijing and Washington are engaged in an intense competition.\n\n\u201cBeijing\u2019s view is that the U.S. and China are in this rivalry, and it will continue no matter who runs in the election,\u201d Ian Chong, a political scientist at the National University of Singapore, told VOA by phone.\n\nOther experts say the Chinese government may not have clear expectations about how different candidates may focus on issues related to China.\n\n\u201cDespite being the vice president, Harris hasn't said that much on foreign policy, especially compared to the known track records of both Biden and Trump,\u201d said Timothy Rich, a political scientist at Western Kentucky University.\n\n\u201cSo, a known Trump, however erratic, may be easier [for Beijing] to prepare for than Harris,\u201d he told VOA in a written response.\n\nIf November\u2019s election becomes a race between Trump and Harris, Rich thinks a potential Trump victory would mean more tariffs on Chinese commodities and a more explicit view of trade as a zero-sum game. A potential Harris administration, he adds, may adopt a more nuanced approach to address Washington\u2019s trade relationship with China.\n\nOn the issue of Taiwan, Rich said the fact that the Republican National Committee excluded Taiwan from the party platform may suggest Trump is \u201cthinking transactionally about how cutting off support for Taiwan could lead to some big trade agreement with China.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn contrast, I can\u2019t see a Harris administration deviating on support for Taiwan much from her predecessor,\u201d he told VOA.",

        "text": "Biden drops out of 2024 presidential race\nHe struggled to recover from a disastrous debate and Democrats' doubts.\n\nPresident Joe Biden is leaving the 2024 race after a halting debate performance against Donald Trump led to questions from Democrats about his age, ability to carry out his campaign and whether he could serve a second term.\n\nBiden said in a statement posted Sunday that he will \"stand down.\"\n\n\"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,\" he wrote, in part, in a letter posted on X. \"And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.\"\n\n\"I will speak to the Nation later this week in more detail about my decision,\" he added. First lady Jill Biden reposted her husband's post announcing he's dropping out with a hearts emoji.\n\nIn another post on X, Biden gave his \"full support and endorsement\" for Vice President Kamala Harris to be the Democratic Party's nominee.\n\nPresident Joe Biden speaks from the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, July 14, 2024. Susan Walsh/AP\n\nThe stunning move upends what has been a long general election rematch between Biden and Trump, both of whom handily won their party's primaries, with less than four months until the November contest.\n\nWhile concerns about Biden's age plagued him since he launched his reelection campaign in April 2023, they reached a fever pitch following his showdown with Trump at the CNN debate in Atlanta in late June.\n\nBiden, who at 81 is the oldest sitting president in history, spoke with a hoarse voice that his team attributed to a cold. But coupled with his meandering answers and inability to hit Trump hard on key Democratic issues, his performance left some pundits and politicians speechless.\n\nAPresident Joe Biden delivers remarks during the CNN Presidential Debate at the CNN Studios, June 27, 2024, in Atlanta. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nThe White House and campaign chalked up the performance as a \"bad night.\" Biden defiantly insisted he would remain in the race, repeatedly telling Democrats he was the best option to defeat Trump.\n\n\"I convinced myself of two things. I'm the most qualified person to beat him, and I know how to get things done,\" Biden told ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos in his first post-debate television interview.\n\n\"Look. I mean, if the Lord Almighty came down and said, 'Joe, get outta the race,' I'd get outta the race. The Lord Almighty's not comin' down,\" Biden said at the time.\n\nBut early polling showed the debate's negative impact. In 538's national polling average, Trump now leads by 2 percentage points over Biden, while the two candidates were just about tied on the day of the June 27 debate.\n\nPresident Joe Biden speaks alongside Prime Minister of the Czech Republic Petr Fiala before a bilateral meeting in the Oval Office of the White House, April 15, 2024. Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n\nAnd despite Biden and his campaign's furious attempts at damage control, including a press conference after concluding a NATO summit in Washington where he took reporter questions for nearly an hour and tried to make the case he must \"finish the job,\" a steady drumbeat of Democratic lawmakers and public figures called on him to step aside as the nominee.\n\nThe number of congressional Democrats who called on him to step aside rose to 40 by the time Biden announced his decision to leave the race.\n\n\"The one thing I know for sure is that we can do better than Joe Biden as a person who can deliver our message in this election cycle,\" Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., had previously told ABC News. \"And we have time to do that. And we should.\"\n\nBiden was also taken off the campaign trail these past few days due to a case of COVID-19, which he is recovering from at his residence in Rehoboth, Delaware.\n\nTo emphasize how closely held Biden's decision to exit the race was, a source familiar with the matter told ABC Senior White House Correspondent Selina Wang that Biden informed his senior team that he changed his mind about staying in the race at 1:45 p.m. Sunday.\n\nBiden's letter came out at 1:46 p.m. -- so his staff was told just one minute before the public announcement that he was dropping out.\n\nBefore Biden's revelation Sunday, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer had publicly said they supported Biden making a decision during the party's turmoil. But privately, they were said to have been sympathetic to the view held by a growing number of congressional Democrats that Biden was on a path to lose to Trump.\n\nSchumer went to Delaware to speak to Biden and made the case it would be best if Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race, ABC News Chief Washington Correspondent Jonathan Karl reported.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris speaks at a campaign event in Greensboro, N.C., July 11, 2024. Chuck Burton/AP\n\nAs scrutiny of Biden intensified, focus increased on Vice President Kamala Harris as a possible choice to replace him as the Democratic nominee.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have picked her unless I thought she was qualified to be president,\u201d Biden said of Harris at his press conference on July 11.\n\nThe Democratic Party's dysfunction stood in sharp contrast to the steadfast party unity shown to Trump, despite his own struggles that include a historic conviction, during the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nAs he accepted his party's nomination, Trump spoke of the \"love in the room\" and enthusiasm for what's to come.\n\n\"I am running to be president for all of America, not half of America, because there is no victory in winning for half of America,\" Trump said.\n\nHarris, in a statement Sunday, thanked Biden for his \"decades of service to our country\" and said she \"will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party -- and unite our nation -- to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda.\"\n\n\"I am honored to have the President\u2019s endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination,\" Vice President Harris said.\n\nABC News' Selina Wang and Fritz Farrow contributed to this report.",

        "text": "The latest US presidential twist throws the race wide open \u2013 but what could it mean for Australia? | Arthur Sinodinos\nThe 2024 US presidential election is proof that in America nothing succeeds like excess.\n\nThe standing down of President Biden is just the latest twist in this extraordinary race \u2013 and could be the circuit breaker the Democrats are looking for. It removes age as an issue for them and potentially refocuses the campaign, with Kamala Harris the standard bearer.\n\nShe is within striking distance of Trump in national polls and involves the least disruptive transition to the Democrat campaign. Trump may seek to ridicule \u2018laughing\u2019 Kamala but that could backfire with voters, particularly women. She will need a running mate who can appeal in the swing states and has a compelling personal story. This will inject new energy into the campaign.\n\nUndoubtedly, Trump has momentum. The former president\u2019s acceptance speech at the RNC did not chart a new policy direction or presage a kinder, gentler politics. That is not what fuels the Maga engine. Trump has harnessed the anger of those Americans who feel like outsiders in their own country, threatened by rapid change, identity politics and left behind by the widening of income and wealth inequalities.\n\nThe selection of JD Vance, a smart and articulate convert to Maga is a signal that Trump is not looking to appeal to the ever-shrinking pool of moderates or independents. In Trump\u2019s eyes, Maga is here to stay, and Vance is its tribune.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 best strategy now is to turn the election into a referendum on Trump\u2019s negatives, which they define as the chaos of his first term and threat to American institutions. The departure of President Biden provides that opportunity.\n\nUS elections are determined by turnout. The Maga base is energised by Trump\u2019s \u2018resurrection\u2019. Democrats will now have to pick themselves off the floor and push the buttons of various sections of the electorate to motivate turnout.\n\nIn many ways, this is now a race between Vance and Harris, who is the most likely Democrat nominee. The age issue has been turned on its head. Vance\u2019s views come into focus now that he is only a heartbeat away from the presidency.\n\nMany women will vote to send a message on restriction of abortion rights. Vance\u2019s strong views on restricting abortion rights provide a perfect foil for this argument. Harris is best placed to run that argument. Trump has soft-pedalled on the issue in recognition of its lethality to his campaign.\n\nWhat does this mean for Australia and the rest of the world? Do not expect much change in international economic policy from either side of politics.\n\nTrump upended trade policy in 2016, forcing Hillary Clinton to disown her administration\u2019s centrepiece trade strategy for the Indo-Pacific, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which dealt a major blow to the US pivot to the region. Since then, market access agreements have been off the table for both sides of politics with more interest in how to tilt the playing field in favour of US firms by imposing higher labour and environmental costs on foreign competitors.\n\nCovid 19 and the technological cold war with China are also reshaping industrial supply chains with more reshoring and friend-shoring in the offing. The Aukus capability pact and the Quad focus on critical and emerging tech are leading examples of this trend. Both Trump and a reelected Democrat administration will double down on this, with perhaps more onshoring in Trump\u2019s case.\n\nOne major point of difference is climate change policy and international cooperation. Trump is likely to again withdraw from the Paris agreement and promises to drill for more oil from day one, further extending America\u2019s energy independence and fossil fuel exports. His industry policy is lower energy costs and less regulation to attract more onshoring.\n\nTrump\u2019s tech policy is unclear. He flip-flopped on the banning of TikTok. He is courting the Silicon Valley titans, who are turning Maga in the hope of less tax on capital and no more regulation. Trump\u2019s main beef with big tech is that it restricts free speech (his speech) on social media. Vance is a fan of support for little tech in opposition to big tech, and this appeals to his venture capitalist backers.\n\nThe Trump mantra of \u2018no more wars\u2019 appeals to an electorate exhausted by the blood and treasure expended in Afghanistan and Iraq. It is likely he will follow through on solving Ukraine in one day (by effectively abandoning it), he is encouraging Israel to \u2018finish the job\u2019 in Gaza as soon as possible (that is, not on his watch) and the signal to China on Taiwan is very mixed. However, many Republicans are ardent supporters of Taiwan and its right to exist. This could put a brake on Trump sacrificing Taiwan on the altar of a grand bargain with China on trade.\n\nTrump is ahead now but we saw over the weekend how quickly things can change. As they used to say on World Championship Wrestling, anything can happen \u2013 and probably will.",

        "text": "Shifting from Biden to Harris, Democrats reset the race. But scholars see risks.\nIt is a moment of extraordinary significance in U.S. political history: Joe Biden, 81 years old and seemingly frail, is stepping away from his campaign less than four months before the election. He has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, 59, who would be the first Black, Asian-American woman ever to lead the nation. Democrats have quickly rallied behind her.\n\nScholars at UC Berkeley are unanimous that the election has been transformed, and that the Democrats\u2019 change of candidates will have vast, but unpredictable, implications for the campaign. The impact could play out not just in the horse race with Donald Trump and GOP vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance, but in the courts, in simmering cultural tensions over race relations and gender roles, in efforts to engage young voters and in the health of U.S. democracy.\n\nIn the hours after Biden\u2019s announcement, some of Berkeley\u2019s top political scholars offered their analysis and insights.\n\nBerkeley News: What effect will Biden\u2019s decision to drop out have on the presidential race?\n\nEric Schickler\n\nBiden\u2019s decision transforms the election. There is little question that he was significantly behind former President Trump, and the prospects for making up that ground were dim once the debate greatly exacerbated preexisting concerns about the president\u2019s age.\n\nDemocrats have had a serious enthusiasm problem looking ahead to November. Biden\u2019s departure gives an opening for the party to nominate a candidate who is better positioned to mobilize those with unfavorable views of both the current and former president.\n\nBiden\u2019s decision will also reverberate in the race to win Congress. Every Democratic candidate for Congress was going to face ongoing questions about the president\u2019s ability to serve a second term. This takes those questions off the table, allowing Democratic candidates to focus on what Donald Trump and a GOP Congress would do if they are elected in November.\n\nBiden\u2019s endorsement of Vice President Harris makes it more likely that the party quickly unifies behind her. I would be surprised if one of the top potential Democratic candidates for 2028 decides to challenge the vice president at this late date in the calendar.\n\n\u2014 Eric Schickler, political scientist and co-director of the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies\n\nSome people have suggested that a change of candidates at this point could fully reset the race. Is that possible? Or are people so locked into their camps that this change will make no difference?\n\nHenry Brady\n\nI believe that many Americans will feel a tremendous sense of relief in the next few days. For those committed to President Biden, they will be inspired by seeing that he has recognized his limitations and decided to enable a renewal of the Democratic Party by dropping out.\n\nFor those who are independents or who lean toward the Republican Party and who are uncertain about Donald Trump, especially after his meandering, sometimes incoherent and grievance-filled acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, there will be the hope that the Democrats nominate an energetic, thoughtful, youthful and capable candidate who can put forth a positive program.\n\nFor those who are die-hard Donald Trump supporters, there will be the usual presumption of his infallibility and invincibility, so not much will change there. But for undecided voters and supporters of Joe Biden, there will be a sense that there is now the possibility that America will have a real choice \u2014 not just between a candidate who often sounds unhinged and a candidate who seems too old for the job.\n\nPresident Biden deserves our praise for his willingness to step aside and to allow America to get beyond the present impasse, and I suspect that his decision will fill the sails of the nation and lead to a campaign that will focus on issues and democracy instead of fears and recriminations.\n\n\u2014 Henry Brady, former dean of the UC Berkeley Goldman School of Public Policy, former president of the American Political Science Association\n\nWhat are the opportunities here for the Democratic Party and its candidates? What are the risks?\n\nLisa Garcia Bedolla Photo courtesy of Lisa Garc\u00eda Bedolla\n\nPresident Biden\u2019s historic decision to leave the presidential race opens up an opportunity for the Democratic Party: the chance to reengage weak partisans and no party preference voters.\n\nWe often forget that who decides U.S. presidential elections is, in fact, those who choose not to vote. The 2020 presidential election had the highest turnout since 1900, yet one-third of eligible voters stayed home. Our political punditry is caught up in a polarized partisan world, ignoring that many Americans are simply disengaged from, and disenchanted by, that world.\n\nThis moment gives the Democrats the chance to shift the narrative and give those disaffected eligible voters a reason to support Vice President Harris. What those voters want is a candidate who is willing to address the big issues that Americans are facing today: inflation, the lack of affordable housing and a growing sense that their communities are unsafe.\n\nWhat they don\u2019t want is a slick marketing campaign, with a candidate who parses every word and who is overly positive about how things are going, particularly regarding the economy. Americans are still suffering from a profound post-COVID sense of social dislocation. They want a president who understands that and has concrete plans for addressing it.\n\n\u2014 Lisa Garc\u00eda Bedolla, political scientist, vice provost for graduate studies and dean of the Graduate Division\n\nThe Democrats thus far seem to be coming together quickly behind Vice President Kamala Harris to replace Biden at the top of the ticket. Given that she is a Black, Asian-American woman, how do you think race, ethnicity and gender issues might play out in the campaign between now and election day in November?\n\nDavid C. Wilson Brittany Hosea-Small for UC Berkeley\n\nThe ascendance of Vice President Kamala Harris to the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee will likely raise a number of both legitimate and offending questions and activate stereotypes that distract from the importance of the moment.\n\nNaturally, people will see Harris as a Black woman \u201cwith Asian heritage,\u201d a liberal Californian and someone who might not have earned the powerful position she now holds, believing that Biden \u201cgave\u201d her the opportunity. The media and public should focus instead on her merits as San Francisco district attorney, California attorney general, U.S. senator and White House cabinet member. She has more political experience than former President Donald Trump and vice-presidential nominee J.D. Vance combined.\n\nAlready, many pundits are using narratives proposing that \u201cAmerica is not ready for a Black woman\u201d (or \u201cwoman\u201d) president. This may be true, as many Americans hold stereotypes that women are weak and passive leaders. In addition, recent comments from both male and female athletes and entertainers have proposed that a woman\u2019s place is in the home as a wife or caregiver, as opposed to a working professional or public leader.\n\nIn terms of race, Harris is a graduate of Howard University, a historically Black institution, and a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, which brings some credibility among African American voters. Her lighter complexion and Asian background, combined with her role as a legal prosecutor, also raise questions of authenticity among some Black voters. When you are the first of a particular demographic to do something, you are almost always burdened with the handicap of explaining why.\n\nThus, for white males, the average task is to promote your merits and explain away your faults, but for women and racial-ethnic minorities, the task is to get people to see your merits and not see your group identity as a fault.\n\n\u2014 David C. Wilson, dean of the Goldman School of Public Policy and author of Racial Resentment in the Political Mind (University of Chicago Press, 2022)\n\nDoes a change of candidate create conditions in which the Democrats will be better able to go on the offense against a president and vice president who would seem to be vulnerable?\n\nM. Steven Fish\n\nAmericans are hungry for a real leader who makes us feel great about our country and her ability to steer it to still greater heights, not yet another politician who reads issue polls in the morning and spends the rest of the day telling us what she thinks we want to hear on this or that \u201ckitchen table issue.\u201d\n\nTo maximize her chances in November, Kamala Harris must move past the Biden campaign\u2019s banalities about controlling prescription drug prices and \u201cgrowing the economy from the middle out.\u201d The vice president\u2019s task is to show herself to be stronger, firmer in her convictions, more committed to the law and the defense of democracy and more patriotic than Trump.\n\nIt was heartening to see her step out on her first day as nominee-presumptive with a hardcore message that casts herself as a tough-minded prosecutor of abused women and predatory banks. That contrasts with Trump, the felonious abuser of women and servant of the plutocracy.\n\nProjecting exuberance and boundless optimism about the nation\u2019s promise will also be key to seizing the flag from MAGA\u2019s ethnonational nativists and reaching swing voters. Many of those who know Harris personally say she\u2019s got the right stuff. Now\u2019s the time to bring it \u2014 and bring it hard.\n\n\u2014 M. Steven Fish, political scientist, author of \u201cComeback: Routing Trumpism, Reclaiming the Nation, and Restoring Democracy\u2019s Edge (Rivertowns Books, May 2024)\n\nIn effect, Biden\u2019s decision means that the Democrats must throw out the results of the primary elections earlier this year, but a new structure for nominating a candidate has not emerged. How are the Democrats going to manage this?\n\nDan Schnur\n\nThe biggest question going forward is whether the Democrats want an open and competitive nomination process, or one that appears to be open \u2014 but isn\u2019t.\n\nThose who are confident in Harris\u2019 ability to beat Trump want to have this set up for her without looking like a coronation. But Democrats who are worried about her ability to win in November are looking for ways to set up a legitimate contest that would allow the most well-prepared and skilled candidate to emerge as the nominee. That might be Harris, or it might not. But the point would be for her to prove herself, rather than having the nomination handed to her.\n\nHarris and her team are already working furiously to nail down enough support to discourage any opponents from stepping forward. We\u2019ll see in the next few days whether she can pull that off or not. But the outcome will be a direct result in the level of confidence that party leaders have in Harris, or whether she still has some convincing to do.\n\n\u2014 Dan Schnur, veteran Republican political strategist, lecturer at the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies\n\nTo what extent will the change of candidates \u2013 and the process used to make the change \u2014 face legal challenges from Republicans or others? How viable are those challenges likely to be?\n\nEmily Rong Zhang\n\nA legal challenge to Biden\u2019s withdrawal is very unlikely to succeed.\n\nGenerally, the doctrine in this area gives political parties a great deal of latitude to conduct their internal affairs, including who they select as their presidential candidate. Political parties are ultimately private entities, even if their actions have immense public implications.\n\nThis is not to say that there are no limits on their actions. For instance, they are not allowed to racially discriminate in the candidate selection process. But it is very unlikely that a court will find that such limits have been breached in this case.\n\n\u2014 Emily Rong Zhang, assistant professor of law, specializing in election law\n\nThe change of candidates will almost certainly reflect a broad generational change in the leadership \u2014 and perhaps the orientation \u2014 of the Democratic Party. What are the implications of having a younger candidate?\n\nJake Grumbach\n\nElected officials in the U.S. are the oldest of any democracy. In recent years, some politicians\u2019 decisions to remain in office at very old ages have had large effects on political representation. Joe Biden, in voluntarily ending his presidential campaign, has therefore done something relatively rare in American politics.\n\nKamala Harris, at age 59, is about the age of the average member of Congress. While older than leaders of most other countries, Harris is significantly younger than Donald Trump and other recent presidential contenders. This could be electorally advantageous, as American voters consistently tell pollsters that they would prefer younger politicians.\n\nThis story also speaks to how political parties work. Parties are meant to take a bunch of people \u2014 voters, politicians, policy activists and others \u2014 and make them into a (somewhat) cooperative team. One of the most important collective decisions that parties in the U.S. have to make is to nominate a competitive presidential candidate.\n\nMembers of the Democratic Party worried that Biden was not an especially competitive candidate in 2024, so they made a coordinated push to replace him. Both this push, and the relatively seamless transition to Harris as presumptive nominee, show signs of a functioning political party that is able to coordinate and compromise around finding a solution that might benefit the whole party.\n\n\u2014 Jake Grumbach, associate professor at the Goldman School of Public Policy\n\nCould this change of candidates, and the almost certain emergence of a younger candidate from a new generation, increase turnout among young voters this November?\n\nSarah Swanbeck Brandon S\u00e1nchez Mejia/UC Berkeley\n\nA younger candidate entering the race could energize the base and inject new enthusiasm for younger voters who have grown weary of politics-as-usual.\n\nWhether this translates to a large surge in youth voter turnout in November may come down to whether the new Democratic nominee also can convince young voters of a credible plan to address the existential threats they see in their everyday lives \u2014 a concrete plan to address climate change, clear ideas for how to shore up our democratic institutions, and an economic policy agenda that will improve social mobility and convince younger generations that the American Dream is still within their reach.\n\n\u2014Sarah Swanbeck, executive director of the Berkeley Institute for Young Americans",

We just have to remember we are the United States of America.\"\n\nFirst Lady Jill Biden, whose loyalty to her husband has been unswerving, responded by sharing his statement on X with a simple heart emoji.\n\nMs Harris, who many are touting as the frontrunner to replace Mr Biden, said she was \"honoured\" to have the president's endorsement, adding \"my intention is to earn and win this nomination\".\n\nShe thanked Mr Biden for his \"extraordinary leadership\" and for making a \"selfless and patriotic act\" by stepping aside.\n\nShe said: \"I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party - and unite our nation - to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda.\n\n\"We have 107 days until Election Day.

From energy independence to letting in millions and millions of illegal immigrants.\"\n\nImage: Mr Biden's debate with Mr Trump marked a turning point. Pic: AP\n\nMr Trump said Ms Harris will be easier to defeat in the race for the White House than Mr Biden.\n\nIn a phone call with CNN minutes after Mr Biden's announcement, Mr Trump said he did not know who he would face, but suggested the vice president would not pose him a bigger problem than the sitting president.\n\nIn a post on his Truth Social platform, he said: \"Crooked Joe Biden was not fit to run for President, and is certainly not fit to serve - And never was!\"\n\nMr Trump claimed Mr Biden \"attained\" the job as president \"by lies, Fake News, and not leaving his Basement\".\n\nBiden endorses Kamala Harris\n\nAttention will now turn to who will succeed him, with the selection likely to happen at the Democratic National Convention in August.\n\nShortly after announcing he was pulling out, Mr Biden backed his vice president Ms Harris to take his place as the Democratic Party's nominee for the presidential election.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:20 US correspondent Mark Stone breaks down how the US election system works.\n\nHe thanked her for being \"an extraordinary partner\" before backing her to take the party's nomination.\n\nIn a statement on X, he said: \"Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year.\"\n\nShe appears to be the natural successor, in large part because she is the only candidate who can directly tap into the Biden campaign's war chest, according to federal campaign finance rules.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:44 Could Kamala Harris be the next US president?\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nMr Biden's backing helps clear the way for her, but a smooth transition is by no means assured.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether other candidates could challenge Ms Harris for the nomination, or how party may need to adjust its rules again to smooth Ms Harris's nomination on the floor.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee chair, Jaime Harrison, has promised a \"transparent and orderly process\" in selecting its next candidate.\n\nHe said the Democrats will share more about \"next steps and a path forward\" shortly, adding: \"The work that we must do now, while unprecedented, is clear.\"\n\nObama thanks Biden - but does not endorse Harris\n\nBarack Obama has praised Mr Biden but has not endorsed Mr Harris to lead the Democratic Party.\n\nHe said in a statement: \"We will be navigating uncharted waters in the days ahead.

        "text": "2024 US election: Republicans pushed to rethink campaign strategy after Biden's withdrawal\nDonald Trump at an election rally at Van Andel Arena, Grand Rapids, Michigan, July 20, 2024. ANNA MONEYMAKER / AFP\n\nThe Democratic camp had increasingly called on US President Joe Biden to withdraw from the presidential race over the past few weeks, but the outgoing president unwittingly found unexpected allies in the inner circle of his Republican opponent, Donald Trump. Four days before the solemn announcement of Biden's withdrawal, on Sunday, July 21, the head of Trump's campaign team, Chris LaCivita, denounced an \"attempted coup\" against the White House occupant on the sidelines of the inaugural convention in Milwaukee.\n\nAnd with good reason. The June 27 debate, a disaster for Biden, had enabled the former president to appear, on the contrary, in full possession of his bearings, even before his spectacular reaction after an assassination attempt against him on July 13. During this debate, the contrast with the exchange that pitted the two men against each other during the 2020 campaign was striking. Four years ago, during a single confrontation between them, Trump deployed irrelevant aggressiveness. After a particularly laborious speech by the Democrat on the issue of immigration, Trump settled for a cruel observation: \"I really don't know what he said at the end of that sentence. I don't think he knows what he said either,\" he jabbed.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, marked by the incumbent president's difficulty demonstrating his ability to campaign with the necessary energy, Trump maintained an unusual reserve. Democratic divisions over the legitimacy of Biden's candidacy did his job for him.\n\nRead more From denial to withdrawal: The three weeks that led Joe Biden to pull out of the race for the White House\n\nOn Sunday, the Republican candidate refrained from hailing Biden's historic decision, even though it marked the end of an exceptionally long political career. Mitt Romney, Republican senator from Utah and one of the last vestiges of the Grand Old Party before its total takeover by Trump, was one of the few in his camp to greet him warmly.\n\nTrue to his style and rhetoric, Trump declared on his Truth Social account: \"Crooked Joe was not fit to run. [...] and is certainly not fit to serve \u2013 And never was,\" he posted, a week after briefly appealing for unity in the country, in the wake of the attack on him.\n\nLikely to mobilize minorities\n\nThis line of attack was scrupulously repeated by other Republican officials in the hours that followed. \"If Joe Biden is not fit to run for president, he is not fit to serve as president. He must resign the office immediately. November 5 cannot arrive soon enough,\" said Mike Johnson, Republican speaker of the House of Representatives. In the coming days, the Grand Old Party is expected to step up its accusations against the Democratic Party, which it claims has concealed the reality of the outgoing president's state of health.\n\nYou have 60.99% of this article left to read.

Trump\u2019s lead in the 2024 presidential race has widened after President Biden\u2019s fumbling debate performance last week, as concerns that Mr. Biden is too old to govern effectively rose to new heights among Democrats and independent voters, a new poll from The New York Times and Siena College showed.\n\nMr. Trump now leads Mr. Biden 49 percent to 43 percent among likely voters nationally, a three-point swing toward the Republican from just a week earlier, before the debate. It is the largest lead Mr. Trump has recorded in a Times/Siena poll since 2015. Mr. Trump leads by even more among registered voters, 49 percent to 41 percent.\n\nDoubts about Mr. Biden\u2019s age and acuity are widespread and growing. A majority of every demographic, geographic and ideological group in the poll \u2014 including Black voters and those who said they will still be voting for him \u2014 believe Mr. Biden, 81, is too old to be effective.\n\n[The poll does not show a fundamental change in the race, but it adds to longstanding concerns, Nate Cohn writes.]",

        "text": "How Kamala Harris's run for the US presidency has reignited old racist and sexist tropes\nFour years ago, when Kamala Harris became US President Joe Biden's running mate, she also became \"the most derided woman\" in US politics, according to a misinformation study.\n\nThe analysis identified Ms Harris, a black and south Asian woman, as a lightning rod for misogyny and racism. On Monday after Mr Biden endorsed her to lead the Democrats, it only took minutes for deeply offensive false narratives about her to resurface.\n\nABC NEWS Verify has been tracking how old tropes, falsehoods, and misinformation are already being weaponised against the current frontrunner for the Democratic nomination.\n\nOur analysis also provides a preview of how grim the political discourse may yet become.\n\nKamala Harris, the 'diversity hire'\n\nJoe Biden endorsed Kamala Harris to lead the Democrats for the 2024 US presidential election after he decided to quit the contest on Monday. (Reuters: Tom Brenner)\n\nFew three-letter acronyms ignite controversy like DEI, which stands for diversity, equity, and inclusion.\n\nThe term is a basic corporate framework about embracing all aspects of social identity (including race, sex, age, sexual orientation, physical disabilities, and socio-economic class) and promoting fair treatment and equal opportunities.\n\nA Pew Research Center survey from last year showed a majority of US workers believed DEI was a \"good thing\", with only 16 per cent labelling it as a \"bad thing\".\n\nBut the term has become a racist dog whistle and the bogeyman of the far-right.\n\nThe term DEI in relation to Ms Harris on X (formerly Twitter) received renewed interest in the hours after Mr Biden's endorsement. Many among the flurry of posts suggested that Ms Harris was only chosen for her ethnicity and gender.\n\nAn example of an X post linking Kamala Harris with DEI, from an account with millions of followers. (Supplied)\n\nFormer Trump aide Sebastian Gorka \u2014 who has previously called the vice-president \"coloured\" and a \"DEI hire\" \u2014 was cut off during an interview on conservative British news channel GB News after questioning her history with \"unkind language\".\n\n\"This woman, this disaster whose only qualification is having a vagina and the right skin colour\u2026\" Dr Gorka began before being interrupted by the host Mark Dolan, who reminded him that Ms Harris was an \"accomplished lawyer\" and an experienced politician.\n\nWashington-based disinformation expert Nina Jankowicz said the dismissal of Ms Harris as the \"DEI candidate\" was also a feature of the last presidential election campaign.\n\n\"It's a pretty well-worn way that we talk about women in positions of power; [that] they couldn't have gotten there on their own.\n\n\"They're [Republicans] going to claim they're [Democrats] running this woman because they have to be bound by diversity, equity and inclusion.\"\n\nNina Jankowicz knew well-worn racist and sexist tropes would resurface after the endorsement. (Supplied: The Wilson Center)\n\nMs Jankowicz, CEO of the disinformation-countering American Sunlight Project, was the lead author of the 2021 study that identified Ms Harris as the focus of online abuse of female politicians.\n\nThe analysis of online conversations about 13 female politicians in a two-month period just before the 2020 election, found that three-quarters of abusive content shared targeted the then-California senator.\n\n\"When I saw the endorsement [of Ms Harris] from President Biden I was expecting this kind of disinformation.\"\n\nMs Jankowicz was briefly the executive director of the Department of Homeland Security's Disinformation Governance Board before it was disbanded.\n\nThe big unknown facing Harris as she eyes a fight against Trump Photo shows A woman with dark hair smiling and a man with blond hair and pursed lips Never before has a major US political party switched horses midstream this close to a presidential election. There are so many unknowns.\n\nPart of what has fuelled these DEI narratives was a comment made by Mr Biden in 2020 during a debate, where he pledged to pick a woman to be his vice-president.\n\n\"There are a number of women who are qualified to be president tomorrow. I would pick a woman to be my vice-president,\" he said at the time.\n\nBeyond the racist implications that a woman of colour is presumed to be less qualified for a position, the term DEI has become a scapegoat for almost every kind of grievance.\n\nIt's been blamed for everything \u2014 cost-of-living, poor box-office performances, aviation safety, the bridge collapse in Baltimore and last week's CrowdStrike global outage.\n\nThe omnipresent George Soros conspiracy theory\n\nIt didn't take long for another narrative to enter the fray, this one xenophobic in nature and boosted by the billionaire owner of social media platform X, Elon Musk.\n\nElon Musk posted on X implying that the son of billionaire philanthropist George Soros was pulling the strings of the Democratic Party. (Supplied)\n\n\"I'd just like to thank @AlexanderSoros for not keeping everyone in suspense about who the next puppet would be,\" Mr Musk posted in response to the news that Open Society Foundation chair Alexander Soros had endorsed Ms Harris.\n\nMr Soros is the son of billionaire philanthropist and former currency speculator George Soros, a Jewish-Hungarian man who escaped the Holocaust and eventually immigrated to the United States.\n\nThe elder Mr Soros, who handed control of his foundation to his son last year, has long been the subject of conspiracy theories alleging control of various organisations and political movements for decades.\n\nBut these allegations are rooted in centuries-old anti-Semitic tropes which claim Jewish people secretly control the world.\n\nWho is Kamala Harris? Photo shows Kamala gestures at a podium. With US President Joe Biden announcing he will not stand for re-election in November, Kamala Harris is seen as a potential successor. But who is she?\n\nABC NEWS Verify has already seen this baseless theory boosted by a prominent right-leaning X account with millions of followers which we have chosen not to name.\n\nAs it spills over into the broader internet and possibly shows up in your feed, it pays to remember it is little more than recycled racism.\n\nWhile Mr Soros is a prolific donor to progressive causes, there is little evidence to suggest he is able to influence global affairs any more than other billionaires, including Mr Musk, who has endorsed Republican former president Donald Trump.\n\nIt also underscores a crucial difference between this year's presidential election campaign and the one four years ago. Mr Musk bought X in 2022 and rapidly dismantled its capacity to detect and moderate harmful content, potentially exposing a candidate like Ms Harris to worse levels of online abuse.\n\nOn top of this, Mr Musk is using his own account, with its swollen ranks of followers, to spread xenophobic conspiracy theories.\n\n'Birtherism' returns\n\nKamala Harris is the frontrunner for the Democrats. (Reuters: Octavio Jones )\n\nFalsehoods about Ms Harris's eligibility to run for president have also resurfaced, with many claiming she cannot hold office because she is not a \"natural born citizen\".\n\nThe claims rely on a persistent but debunked misreading of the US constitution that suggests that because Ms Harris's parents were born overseas she did not meet this criteria. However, she was born in California and based on US law, is a \"natural born citizen\".\n\nThis fringe conspiracy is known as \"birtherism\" and was popularised by Trump during former president Barack Obama's presidency. The false claim was so prevalent during the Obama years that his office was forced to produce a birth certificate. Many \u2014 including Trump \u2014 then suggested it was a forgery.\n\nKamala Harris is the daughter of an Indian American mother and Jamaican American father. (Supplied: Kamala Harris campaign )\n\nThe same racist claims that stalked Mr Obama have also latched onto Ms Harris.\n\nIn August 2020, when she was announced as Mr Biden's running mate, then-president Trump questioned her eligibility.\n\n\"I just heard it today that she [Kamala Harris] doesn't meet the requirements \u2026 I have no idea if that's right,\" he said during a press conference.\n\nOn Monday, three hours after Mr Biden announced he would not be contesting the election, a post on X that repeated the false claims about Ms Harris's eligibility had been viewed more than 4.6 million times.\n\nAs the daughter of migrants, Ms Harris's mixed heritage has also been a focus of some conspiracy theorists and critics of her ties to black culture.\n\nLoading...\n\nBorn to a Jamaican father and an Indian mother, Ms Harris was the first female vice-president and the first of Black and Asian heritage, and has described childhood experiences of structural racism including involvement in black rights activism while at college.\n\n\"I'm black, and I'm proud of being black,\" she said during an interview for her 2020 run.\n\nHowever, in the hours following Mr Biden stepping down, several social media posts criticised her statements about her heritage.\n\nPopular social media posts claimed she was \"only 25 per cent black\" and therefore could not represent black culture.\n\nThe vice-president's mixed heritage would be used to attack her, Ms Jankowicz said.\n\n\"She's \u2026 black and south Asian, so there's a lot going against her.\"\n\nThe disinformation researcher said it was important to \"pre-bunk\" the expected racist and false narratives early.\n\n\"This is an election where it's more important than ever to think about the merits of candidates and their actual track records rather than these childish debased attacks that we've seen so often in politics.\"",

        "text": "AFT votes to endorse Kamala Harris for president\nThe AFT has officially endorsed Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee for president. Delegates from across the nation overwhelmingly voted during a special order of business on Monday, roaring their approval to ratify a resolution passed unanimously by the union\u2019s executive council the night before. The AFT is the first union to endorse Harris.\n\nThe AFT has long championed the Biden-Harris administration for its support of workers, families, unions and democracy, and supporting Harris is an enthusiastic renewal of that commitment. Union leaders lined up at microphones to express their support, noting Harris\u2019 powerful leadership skills, her embrace of accessible healthcare and her commitment to public education and public services, among other attributes they are sure will win her the presidential election.\n\nThe resolution notes both Biden\u2019s accomplishments as \u201cone of the most consequential and meaningful presidents in our history\u201d and his full support and endorsement of his vice president \u201cto continue to move America forward, unite the party, and defeat Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nThe resolution also enumerates Harris\u2019 impressive record and strength as a candidate. From taking the lead in the administration\u2019s fight to restore reproductive freedom, to chairing the White House Task Force on Worker Organizing and Empowerment, she has led the fight for freedom to vote, worked hard to cap the cost of insulin and lower prescription drug costs, and worked to pass the first real gun safety law in decades. The resolution notes Harris\u2019 decadeslong career as a prosecutor, attorney general of California, senator and vice president, and her record of upholding gun safety laws, protecting clean air and water and advocating for survivors of domestic violence.\n\nAs president of the United States, Harris would stand in stark contrast to the Republican candidate, the resolution states. Whereas Harris has championed public schools, investing in mental wellness, career and technical education and community schools, Trump and his secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, \u201csought to demonize, defund and destabilize\u201d public education. Harris fights for the middle class and as vice president enabled increased wages and economic growth, 15 million new jobs and the lowest unemployment in 50 years; under Trump, the nation lost nearly 3 million jobs, and he cut taxes for the rich and increased them for the middle class.\n\nThe Biden-Harris administration made healthcare more accessible by strengthening the Affordable Care Act and negotiated lower prices for prescription drugs; Trump supports Big Pharma and tried to eliminate the ACA.\n\nAs AFT President Randi Weingarten said in her State of the Union speech, this election will be a choice between two value systems. And when this moment is recorded in history books, it will record a people united, mobilized and ready to vote for a better future.\n\n[Virginia Myers, photo by Suzannah Hoover]",

        "text": "What Kamala Harris\u2019s historic bid for the US presidency means for science\nUS President Joe Biden has endorsed vice-president Kamala Harris to take his place in the November election.Credit: Andrew Harnik/Getty\n\nAfter US President Joe Biden ended his re-election campaign on Sunday, he and other senior Democratic politicians threw their support behind current vice-president Kamala Harris. Although the situation could change between now and the official selection of the Democratic candidate for the presidency in August, she is widely expected to face off against former president Donald Trump in the election this November.\n\nHere, Nature talks to policy analysts and researchers about what a potential Harris administration might mean for science, health and the environment.\n\nA background in science and justice\n\nHealth and science have been a part of Harris\u2019s life since an early age: her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, whom Harris cites as a major influence, was a leading breast-cancer researcher who died of cancer.\n\nMuch of Harris\u2019s career has centred on criminal justice \u2014 she served as the district attorney for San Francisco in California from 2004 to 2011 and state attorney general for six years until 2017. She then became a US senator for California.\n\nAs senator, Harris co-sponsored efforts to improve the diversity of the science, technology, engineering and medicine (STEM) workforce. She introduced legislation to aid students from under-represented populations in obtaining jobs and work experience in STEM fields. And in the race for the Democratic nomination for the 2020 presidential election, she proposed a plan to invest US$60 billion to fund historically Black universities and to bolster Black-owned businesses.\n\nAs vice-president, Harris has been chair of the National Space Council, which advises the president on US space policy and strategy. Under her leadership, the body has focused on international cooperation \u2014 for example, with the Artemis mission, which aims to send astronauts to the Moon.\n\nIt is unclear whom Harris will choose to be her running mate if she receives the party nomination. One contender is Mark Kelly, a Democratic US senator for Arizona and former astronaut with decades of experience in science and engineering.\n\nHealth care and drug pricing\n\nDuring the 2020 Democratic primary race, Harris was to Biden\u2019s left on health-care policy. For one, she endorsed a universal single-payer national health insurance system, although she left room for a role for private insurance companies. Biden preferred tweaking the existing system, which he had helped to engineer through the 2010 Affordable Care Act as vice-president under Barack Obama.\n\nNature 632, 15-16 (2024)\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-02394-6\n\nRelated Articles\n\nSubjects",

Here's who to watch\n\ntoggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images; Jon Cherry/Getty Images for Concordia; Allison Joyce/Getty Images; Kent Nishimura/Getty Images; Jeff Chiu/AP; Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images; Brian Cassella/Chicago Tribune/Tribune News Service via Getty Images; Bill Pugliano/Getty Images\n\nFor more on the 2024 race head to the NPR Network's live updates page.\n\nDemocrats are coalescing around Vice President Harris's presidential bid, and now eyes are on who she could pick as her running mate, if she secures the party\u2019s nomination.\n\nIn the weeks since President Biden\u2019s poor debate performance, which pushed many on the left to amplify calls for him to drop out of the race, a handful of Democrats have been seen as potential candidates to run in his place.\n\nNow, some of those same names are being floated as potential vice-presidential candidates.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nLoading...\n\nNotably, most of these potential picks are under 60 years old, which could provide a strikingly different Democratic ticket than just last week. But the potential veeps have a different kind of challenge: low national name recognition and minimal time to change that.\n\nHere\u2019s who may be considered:\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro\n\ntoggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nShapiro leads a state that is crucial to this election \u2013 as it was in 2020. Both Republicans and Democrats know the stakes here, as the state has seen more political ads than any other this cycle.\n\nShapiro is 51, fairly popular, and the first-term governor delivered a sizable victory in 2022. He trounced his Republican competitor by nearly 15 percentage points.\n\nThe Trump campaign has put a lot of time and money into campaigning in Pennsylvania, knowing it has to pull out one of the bricks from Democrats\u2019 so-called Blue Wall states of Pennsylvania, Michigan or Wisconsin. To this point, Trump has had a narrow polling advantage in the state.\n\nBut, while Shapiro may be a household name in his state, he, like many others on this list, is not well known nationally. So, while he has a reputation as a competent governor and former state attorney general, his broader appeal is a question mark.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear\n\ntoggle caption Jon Cherry/Getty Images for Concordia\n\nBeshear is part of a small club within the party of Democratic governors who lead ruby-red states.\n\nHe\u2019s also maintained popularity and has gained a reputation as someone who works well with both parties. Beshear had a 52% approval rating, with only 29% disapproving, according to an April Morning Consult poll. That\u2019s notable popularity, given Biden received much lower marks in the state.\n\nIf Harris, 59, picks Beshear, 46, it would be the youngest Democratic presidential ticket since former President Bill Clinton and former Vice President Al Gore ran more than 30 years ago. Their combined age is only three years older than the 2012 Republican ticket of Mitt Romney and former Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan.\n\nLike Shapiro, Beshear is also not known on the national stage. And he does not come from a swing state.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper\n\ntoggle caption Allison Joyce/Getty Images/Getty Images North America\n\nCooper pulled himself out of consideration on July 29, announcing on social media that it \"just wasn't the right time for North Carolina and for me to potentially be on a national ticket.\"\n\nDemocrats are hoping to flip North Carolina this fall. In 2020, Biden lost the state by less than 2 percentage points, and having Cooper, 67, on the ticket, Democrats hope, could help make up that difference and deliver a much-needed 15 electoral votes.\n\nHarris has been a frequent visitor to the Tar Heel state throughout Biden\u2019s term. Her trip to Fayetteville, N.C., last week marked her 15th stop there since taking office and her seventh this year, according to the White House. On many of those trips, she\u2019s appeared alongside Cooper.\n\nHarris and Cooper have also known each other for more than a decade, first working together when Cooper was state attorney general, and Harris served in the same role in California. Cooper is term-limited as governor and will be leaving office at the end of the year.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nFor Cooper, his biggest obstacles are a lack of national name recognition, his age and that North Carolina is seen as a political reach for Democrats this year.\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg\n\ntoggle caption Kent Nishimura/Getty Images\n\nButtigieg\u2019s 2020 presidential bid makes him a more recognizable face on the campaign trail. As a member of the Biden administration and a former mayor of a small city in Indiana, he could speak to the White House\u2019s record and also potentially appeal to Midwest voters.\n\nHe\u2019s also seen as one of the Democratic Party\u2019s best messengers, willing to debate seemingly anyone on any outlet, including Fox News. He\u2019s acquitted himself well in those settings and during congressional hearings, defending the Biden administration\u2019s policies and the president himself.\n\nThe 42-year-old cabinet official would join Republican Vice Presidential nominee J.D. Vance as the second Millennial on a presidential ticket. Buttigieg and Harris would also be the youngest ticket for Democrats in three decades.\n\nButtigieg is the first openly gay man to hold a cabinet position. And he would be the first to appear on a major party ticket. Even with his prominent position in the Biden Cabinet and his 2020 campaign run, still about half of Americans don\u2019t have an opinion on him, according to a recent Ipsos survey.\n\nArizona Sen. Mark Kelly\n\ntoggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nKelly, 60, represents another key swing state in the presidential race. The 60-year-old is a former astronaut and the husband of former Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was seriously injured in a mass shooting in 2011 and has proven to be a strong fundraiser for Democrats.\n\nKelly has joined Giffords as a loud voice on gun violence prevention. Harris has also made tackling gun violence a priority throughout her time as vice president. Kelly could also help blunt the GOP message on immigration, given he\u2019s from a border state and has put some separation between himself and Biden on border policy.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHe and Giffords also recently penned an op-ed about their struggle to have a child together and revealed that she was undergoing IVF treatments during the time she was shot. Women\u2019s reproductive rights are also a major issue in this campaign.\n\nKelly\u2019s seat isn\u2019t up until 2028, but if Kelly were to join Harris on the ticket \u2013 and they win, it would certainly create a competitive race. While Kelly cuts a good profile, he\u2019s also untested nationally.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom\n\ntoggle caption Jeff Chiu/AP\n\nNewsom, 56, is one of the most recognizable governors in the country. He\u2019s long been a rumored 2028 presidential contender and has been a key Biden ally throughout this campaign.\n\nHe is also seen as one of the Democratic Party\u2019s best messengers with a facility for facts and numbers that stands as a stark contrast to President Biden. He gained a degree of notoriety for sitting for hour-long interviews with Fox News\u2019s Sean Hannity and then debating Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on the conservative cable outlet.\n\nThe California governor has, though, longstanding political baggage dating back early in his career. And if he ran with Harris, they would be an all-California ticket, which could draw ire from the right and present a constitutional hurdle.\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker\n\ntoggle caption Brian Cassella/Chicago Tribune/Tribune News Service via Getty Images\n\nPritzker is a 59-year-old progressive billionaire who has been a vocal supporter of Biden and often goes on the offensive against Trump.\n\nDespite his wealth, he has a blue-collar appeal, and he\u2019s from the Midwest, which could help with those key Blue Wall states.\n\nBut he hails from another blue state, so he may not offer much additional electoral pull for Harris \u2013 and he\u2019s not well known.\n\n\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz\n\ntoggle caption Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n\nWalz has emerged as a surprisingly serious VP contender. He isn\u2019t necessarily from a state considered a swing state since Republicans haven\u2019t won Minnesota in a presidential election for 52 years.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut it was close in 2016, less than 2 points, and he could potentially have appeal in the Upper Midwest beyond Minnesota, where Democrats need to win.\n\nHis biggest contribution to the ticket could be his appeal to \u201cnormal\u201d and a Harris validator. A clip of an interview of him attacking Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, in which he crisply describes them and their policies as \u201cweird,\u201d has been viewed 4.7 million times as of Sunday afternoon. He also does about as good a job as any Democrat in defending Democratic governance.\n\nIn addition to being the governor of Minnesota, the 60-year-old, who grew up in rural Nebraska, is also the head of the Democratic Governors Association and a decorated Army veteran.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer\n\ntoggle caption Bill Pugliano/Getty Images\n\nWhitmer, 52, has been a rising star in the Democratic Party since she won the governor\u2019s race in 2019. She was on the shortlist of names for Biden\u2019s potential VP pick in 2020 and served as a co-chair of Biden\u2019s reelection campaign.\n\nAnd, of course, her state of Michigan will be crucial for Democrats to win. But there has never been an all-female presidential ticket, which could present a hurdle, though it would stand as a stark contrast to the all-white-male Trump-Vance ticket.\n\n",

(Image credit: CBC)\n\nWhat led to this?\n\nAlthough Biden has not said exactly why he stepped down, the announcement follows weeks of Democrats calling him unfit to run after his June 27 debate with Donald Trump.\n\nIn that debate, Biden often trailed off, was difficult to understand, and failed to call out many of Trump\u2019s lies.\n\nHowever, other Democrats wanted him to stay on, warning that it was too late in the campaign to switch candidates.\n\nA party\u2019s expected nominee has never stepped down this close to an election, according to the Associated Press. The election is on Nov. 5.\n\nKamala Harris endorsement\n\nJust 30 minutes after stepping down, Biden endorsed Harris as the new nominee.\n\nIn a statement, Harris praised Biden\u2019s \u201cselfless and patriotic act\u201d and said she hopes to earn her party\u2019s nomination.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden is throwing his support behind Vice-President Kamala Harris. (Image credit: Matt Kelley/The Associated Press)\n\nIn order to be the Democrats\u2019 official candidate, Harris has to win the most votes from party members called \u201cdelegates\u201d at the Democratic National Convention, which starts on Aug. 19.\n\nFormer U.S. President Bill Clinton and other leading Democrats also rallied behind Harris following Biden\u2019s endorsement.\n\nBut not everyone was quick to pledge their support \u2014 former U.S. president Barack Obama praised Biden for stepping down, but stopped short of a Harris endorsement.\n\n\u201cI have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nOther Democrats could still pop up in the coming weeks to run for the party\u2019s nomination.\n\nBut Harris has a big advantage: as Biden\u2019s running mate in the election, she\u2019s the only candidate who is allowed to access his campaign funds, according to federal campaign finance rules.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nBiden said he\u2019ll address the public later this week to give more details about his resignation from the race.\n\nDemocrats don\u2019t have much time to convince voters that their new nominee can beat Trump in November.\n\nBut the Trump campaign will also have to do some scrambling \u2014 after years of developing a campaign strategy focused on Biden as their opponent, they will have to figure out a new approach to a new opponent heading into voting day.\n\n\ufeff\ufeffHave more questions? \ufeffWant to tell us how we're doing?

What led to this decision?\nUS President Joe Biden on Sunday announced that he is dropping his reelection bid against former president Donald Trump in the upcoming 2024 US election, sending shockwaves throughout the country's politics. Joe Biden, after announcing his exit, endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to be the Democrats' new presidential candidate. President Joe Biden drops out of presidential race. (AP)\n\nJoe Biden's decision to drop out of the presidential race came after his poor debate performance against Donald Trump, and the Republican Party taking repeated jibed at him for his \u201cinability\u201d to complete another term as the president. The debate debacle also many Democrat lawmakers urging Joe Biden to withdraw as the presidential candidate.\n\nWhat happened in the hours before Joe Biden dropped out?\n\nThe first person to receive a call from Joe Biden exiting from his reelection bid was Vice President Kamala Harris on Sunday, reported The Washington Post. Joe Biden also held one-to-one meetings with White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, and his campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon.\n\nZients called for a meeting of Joe Biden's campaign staff and White House staff for 1:45pm, so that the US president could brief them over his decision. The chief of staff made a formal announcement regarding the same to the entire White House staff at around 2:30pm on Sunday.\n\nBiden took the decision over the weekend through multiple huddles with White House counselor Steve Ricchetti, senior campaign adviser Mike Donilon, deputy chief of staff Annie Tomasini and senior adviser to the first lady Anthony Bernal, all of whom were at the president's vacation house, The Washington Post reported.\n\nWhy did Joe Biden end reelection bid?\n\nThe calls for Joe Biden to drop out as the US presidential face grew after his debate debacle against Donald Trump on June 27. While the US president blamed his performance on jet lag and international travel, the rank and file in the Democrat Party urged him to drop out of the race.\n\nOpposition to Biden's continued campaign from within his party gained steam over the past week with 36 congressional Democrats - more than one in eight - publicly calling on him to drop out, driven by concerns over his mental acuity, reported Reuters.\n\nLawmakers from the ruling party expressed discontent with Biden continuing on his reelection bid, saying that they feared that the US president, if elected again, could cost them not only the White House but also the chance to control either chamber of Congress next year.\n\nSources told news agency Reuters that Biden had a \u201clast minute change of heart\u201d, and up until Saturday night, had no intention to drop out of the race. The US president only changed his mind on Sunday afternoon, after multiple meetings with his top advisors.",

        "text": "Nebraska push for winner-take-all will wait in line after property tax relief \u2022 Nebraska Examiner\nLINCOLN \u2014 Nebraska Republicans who want to change how the state awards its Electoral College votes before the presidential election this fall will have to wait a little longer.\n\nGov. Jim Pillen\u2019s office confirmed Monday that his written call for this week\u2019s special session will focus on property taxes alone and won\u2019t include winner-take-all.\n\nPillen spokeswoman Laura Strimple said the governor has not shut the door on perhaps calling a special session later this year to consider awarding all five of Nebraska\u2019s electoral votes to the winner of the presidential popular vote statewide. This year that likely would be former President Donald Trump in this Republican-dominated state.\n\nState Sen. Lou Ann Linehan of Omaha told Nebraska Public Media on Monday the tax session could last until Labor Day. If so, that would push a winner-take-all special session into September.\n\nPillen attended GOP convention\n\nThe governor visited the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee on Thursday, the same day Trump spoke. The Trump campaign has made clear that it wants the law changed.\n\nTrump himself called at least one Nebraska state lawmaker last session when the measure was being discussed, the senator told several of his colleagues, although the Trump campaign denied the call being made.\n\nPillen has said Nebraska should not stand alone with Maine in awarding a single vote for the winner in each congressional district, with the rest going to the statewide winner.\n\nThe Nebraska Republican Party has tried for decades to change a 1991 law passed under Democratic Gov. Ben Nelson that allowed one slice of a GOP-leaning state to stay competitive.\n\n2nd District remains closely split\n\nThe Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District, despite the 2020 redistricting that swapped parts of suburban Sarpy County for rural Saunders County, remains politically divided.\n\nIn the last four presidential elections, Democratic and GOP candidates have each won the 2nd District twice. Democrats won a vote in 2008 and 2020. Republicans won in 2012 and 2016.\n\nPillen has told the Examiner he would call a special session on winner-take-all this summer if legislative leaders tell him they have the votes. Thus far, they do not.\n\nState Sen. Loren Lippincott of Central City, who sponsored last year\u2019s winner-take-all proposal, Legislative Bill 764, said Monday he remains short of the 33 votes needed to overcome a promised filibuster.\n\nSeveral local political observers have said the holdouts could face tremendous pressure from Trump and his campaign supporters as the election nears. Some expect senators to flip.\n\nTime for 2024 changes running out\n\nTime is short. The first early ballots get mailed to overseas Nebraskans at least 45 days before the election, in September, and the first early ballots sent to Nebraska addresses are mailed in October.\n\nPart of the reason for the national attention is because of the possibility of the election ending in a 269-269 tie. In that scenario, a single stray electoral vote could matter.\n\nSpeaker of the Legislature John Arch did not immediately return messages seeking comment about winner-take-all discussions in the conservative-led, officially nonpartisan body.\n\nIf Nebraska acts, state lawmakers in Democratic-leaning Maine have said they would consider changing to winner-take-all to avoid handing any one candidate an unfair advantage.\n\nNebraska Democratic Party chair Jane Kleeb has said Republicans are trying to change the rules too close to an election. She has said Trump should compete for 2nd District votes.\n\nBoth major party presidential campaigns have built a presence in the 2nd District in recent months, hiring staff and working with volunteers and U.S. House candidates to knock on doors.",

        "text": "US Presidential Elections 2024: Kamala Harris\u2019 potential running mates \u2013 Who will seal the deal?\nUS President Joe Biden earlier announced his decision to quit the race for the upcoming presidential election, and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee. Moments after his announcement, speculation started running wild over who would be Harris\u2019 running mate, with some Democrats pushing the names of their picks around.\n\nAs of now Harris has only said she will be running for President but has not said anything about who would be her running mate.\n\nBefore the name of Harris\u2019 running mate is announced, let\u2019s take a look at some of the front-runners.\n\nAlso Read Union Cabinet to soon decide on Rs 100 CR credit guarantee scheme for MSMEs: Finance Minister Fifth column by Tavleen Singh: Socialist prince vs real princes Susie Wiles \u2013 All you need to know about first woman to serve as White House Chief of Staff US Elections 2024: What are the swing states? Take a look at who is ahead right now\n\nKentucky Governor Andy Beshear\n\nAccording to Politico, 46-year-old Beshear is one of the front-runners. Coming from Kentucky political royalty, he was elected governor in 2019 and won reelection last November.\n\nAfter Biden\u2019s announcement, he wrote on X, \u201cWhile his decision today could not have been easy, it is in the best interest of our country, and our party. I want to thank him for his leadership, kindness, and for a successful presidency that got big, important things done.\u201d\n\nArizona Senator Mark Kelly\n\nNext up is Arizona Senator Mark Kelly. The 60-year-old has served as a senator since 2020 and is a former NASA astronaut and a Navy combat pilot. Four years ago, he defeated incumbent Republican Martha McSally in the special election for former Sen. John McCain\u2019s seat, becoming the first Democrat to hold the seat since 1962. He then won reelection with ease two years later.\n\nMichigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer\n\nGretchen Whitmer, 52, has been Michigan\u2019s Governor since 2019. Before that, she served in both the Michigan House of Representatives and the Michigan Senate. Her decisive victory in the 2022 gubernatorial race, where she won by nearly 11 points in a battleground state, has positioned her as a potential successor in 2028.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom\n\nThree years younger to Harris, Gavin Newsom, 56, was the mayor of San Francisco when she was the city\u2019s district attorney. They were both elected to statewide office in 2010, with her becoming attorney general and Newsom becoming lieutenant governor.\n\nPennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro\n\nJosh Shapiro, 51, has served as the Governor since 2023. A former Attorney General, he pushed back against Trump\u2019s claims that the 2020 election was rigged. In his 2022 run, he garnered relatively high support from Republicans compared to other Democrats and continues to maintain decent approval ratings across party lines, NBC News said.",

With US President Joe Biden having announced his exit from the 2024 White House race, Michelle Obama\u2019s name is doing the rounds again as the only one who can defeat Donald Trump read more\n\nFormer US President Barack Obama listens as former first lady Michelle Obama speaks during the unveiling of their official White House portraits, in the East Room of the White House, in Washington, US, September, 7, 2022. File Image/Reuters\n\nMichelle Obama\u2019s popularity within Democratic circles and beyond is undeniable. As the spouse of former United States President Barack Obama, she left a lasting impression during her tenure as First Lady of the US, championing various social causes and maintaining a high public profile.\n\nWith the political landscape in the United States having undergone a seismic shift following US President Joe Biden\u2019s decision to withdraw from the 2024 US presidential race. The development has sparked widespread speculation and debate about potential replacements, with Michelle Obama\u2019s name frequently mentioned as a top contender.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer potential candidacy has stirred considerable excitement and concern among different political factions.\n\nWhat are Michelle Obama\u2019s chances?\n\nA recent Ipsos poll revealed that Michelle Obama is the only hypothetical candidate who could decisively defeat Donald Trump in a head-to-head match-up. The poll showed her leading Trump with 50 per cent to his 39 per cent, while other candidates, including Vice President Kamala Harris, showed a much narrower margin or even a slight deficit against Trump.\n\nThen US Democratic presidential candidate Senator Barack Obama (D-IL) (far L), his wife Michelle (2nd L), vice presidential running mate Senator Joe Biden (D-DE) (far R) and his wife Jill (2nd R) stand together at a campaign event at the Old State Capitol in Springfield, Illinois, August 23, 2008. File Image/Reuters\n\nAdditionally, a survey by The Center Square Voters\u2019 Voice in collaboration with Noble Predictive Insights indicated that 24 per cent of Democrat-leaning likely voters preferred Michelle Obama over other candidates, with Kamala Harris trailing significantly at 7 per cent.\n\nAre Republicans \u2018scared\u2019?\n\nRepublican figures have also taken notice of Michelle Obama\u2019s potential candidacy. US Senator Kevin Cramer told New York magazine that \u201cMichelle Obama would probably be the one person that could step in and keep the party united and probably provide a little bit of a moving start because of her obvious notoriety.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Why Joe Biden\u2019s decision to drop out is not necessarily good news for Donald Trump\n\nFormer GOP contender Vivek Ramaswamy echoed this sentiment, predicting that neither Joe Biden nor Kamala Harris would secure the Democratic nomination and leaving open the possibility for Michelle Obama to step in.\n\nWhat has Michelle Obama said?\n\nDespite the widespread speculation, Michelle Obama has consistently stated her disinterest in running for office.\n\nFormer US First Lady Michelle Obama attends a groundbreaking ceremony for the Obama presidential center in Jackson Park, in Chicago, Illinois, US, September 28, 2021. File Image/Reuters\n\nIn a Netflix special with Oprah Winfrey, she said, \u201cPolitics is hard. And the people who get into it\u2026 you\u2019ve got to want it. It\u2019s got to be in your soul, because it is so important. It is not in my soul.\u201d Earlier this year, her office reaffirmed this stance to NBC News, clarifying that she had no plans to run for office in 2024.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHas Barack Obama said anything?\n\nFormer US President Barack Obama\u2019s comments have added fuel to the speculation. While praising Joe and Jill Biden, he notably refrained from endorsing Kamala Harris, saying, \u201cFor now, Michelle and I just want to express our love and gratitude to Joe and Jill for leading us so ably and courageously during these perilous times \u2014 and for their commitment to the ideals of freedom and equality that this country was founded on.\u201d\n\nAlso Read | Joe Biden exits, Kamala Harris top contender: Is America ready to vote a woman into the White House?\n\nThe phrase \u201cfor now\u201d has led some to believe that an endorsement for another candidate, possibly Michelle Obama, might be forthcoming.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat does the public want?\n\nThe internet has been abuzz with discussions about Michelle Obama\u2019s potential candidacy. Social media platforms, especially X, have seen a surge in posts advocating for her to run.\n\nOne user wrote, \u201cPlease focus on Michelle Obama. Kamala will get thrown under the bus. She is the sacrificial lamb. At the convention, it will be Michelle. Please focus on her statements/behaviour for examination. We will not have enough time once she\u2019s selected.\u201d\n\nUS First lady Jill Biden, left, and second gentleman Douglass Emhoff, right, watch as US President Joe Biden, center left, raises the hand of Vice President Kamala Harris as they view the Independence Day firework display over the National Mall from the balcony of the White House, July 4, 2024, in Washington. File Image/AP\n\nPolitical analysts and commentators have weighed in on the situation. Some believe that Michelle Obama is the Democrats\u2019 best shot at defeating Donald Trump, given her high favorability and public appeal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDawn Staley, a women\u2019s basketball legend and head coach at the University of South Carolina, even made a public appeal to Barack Obama on X: \u201cNow please let us borrow @MichelleObama for just 4 short years!

One day earlier, the AFL-CIO Executive Council, where the APWU is represented by President Mark Dimondstein, voted unanimously to endorse Kamala Harris for U.S. President.\n\nThese votes and endorsements came on the heels of the changed circumstances in the presidential campaign, with President Joe Biden declaring he is no longer a candidate in the upcoming 2024 election.\n\nThe APWU National Executive Board vote also reflects the guidance and direction of the APWU National Convention where 2000 delegates, just last week and prior to Biden\u2019s withdrawal, overwhelmingly voted to endorse the Biden-Harris ticket.\n\nThe National Executive Board recognizes and respects that our members reflect many different political affiliations and viewpoints. The Executive Board does not dictate how our members vote.\n\nThe National Executive Board does encourage our members and their families, regardless of political affiliation, to vote based on the issues that uplift and promote a better life for postal workers and all working people.\n\n\u201cThe outcome of this presidential election will have a huge impact on postal workers and the choice in this election is stark,\u201d declared National President Mark Dimondstein. \u201cEither we elect Donald Trump who plans to destroy the public Postal Service, our jobs and union, further undermine workers\u2019 rights, women\u2019s rights and voting rights, and send us on a path to dictatorship, or elect Kamala Harris who has proven as Vice President and in prior political office, to have demonstrated support for postal issues and some genuine advocacy for workers\u2019 rights, women\u2019s rights, unions, respect for all people and common decency.\u201d\n\nThe APWU will continue to share with the membership issue-based assessments of the 2024 presidential and congressional candidates and encourage our members to be fully engaged in the upcoming and vitally important presidential election as we work together to expand our democratic rights and protect our jobs, our union and the public Postal Service.",

        "text": "Harris slams Trump in first US presidential campaign rally\nUS vice president makes campaign debut in Wisconsin after securing backing of key Democrats and record fundraising.\n\nKamala Harris has reiterated that she is ready to take on Donald Trump in the United States presidential election, as the likely Democratic nominee held her first official campaign rally in her push for the White House.\n\nSpeaking to a crowd in the battleground state of Wisconsin on Tuesday afternoon, the US vice president pledged to unite the Democratic Party \u201cso that we are ready to win in November\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have 105 days until Election Day and in that time, we have some work to do. But we\u2019re not afraid of hard work,\u201d Harris said. \u201cAnd we will win this election.\u201d\n\nThe rally in Milwaukee comes two days after President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 election race following weeks of questions about his age and fitness to serve another term in office.\n\nWhile the US vice president has not officially been confirmed as the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nominee, The Associated Press news agency reported on Monday evening that Harris had secured enough votes from delegates to secure the nomination.\n\nHarris\u2019s candidacy has reinvigorated a US election campaign that had failed to captivate many voters frustrated by a choice between Biden and former President Trump, as well as by the state of the economy, American foreign policy and other issues.\n\nTonight, I am proud to have earned the support needed to become our party\u2019s nominee. Over the next few months, I'll be traveling across the country talking to Americans about everything on the line. I fully intend to unite our party and our nation, and defeat Donald Trump. pic.twitter.com/Bsq3N6pMAi \u2014 Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) July 23, 2024\n\nSince Biden\u2019s decision on Sunday to forgo his re-election bid, Harris has garnered the backing of influential Democrats, including former House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Governors Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Gavin Newsom of California.\n\nThe top Democrats in the US House of Representatives and the US Senate, Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer, also threw their support behind Harris\u2019s candidacy on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cDemocrats are moving forward stronger and more united than ever before,\u201d Schumer told reporters.\n\nHarris\u2019s campaign also said it had collected more than $100m in contributions from Sunday afternoon to Monday evening, with 62 percent of all donations coming from first-time donors.\n\nReporting from the White House on Tuesday morning, Al Jazeera\u2019s Kimberly Halkett said Harris\u2019s candidacy has injected \u201cenormous\u201d excitement into the Democratic presidential race.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is just record-breaking fundraising,\u201d said Halkett, adding that tens of thousands of people also have signed up to work on the vice president\u2019s campaign.\n\nHalkett explained that Harris\u2019s team is concentrating on four key US states \u2013 Nevada, Arizona, Georgia and Pennsylvania \u2013 as well as on younger voters of colour across the country as she prepares to face Trump, the Republican candidate, in November.\n\nWisconsin, which is where the Republican Party held its national convention last week, is also expected to be critical in the race for the White House.\n\n\u201cThere are independents and young people who did not like their choices, and Harris has a chance to win them,\u201d Paul Kendrick, executive director of the Democratic group Rust Belt Rising, told the Reuters news agency.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump and his vice-presidential running mate, Senator JD Vance, have been lambasting Harris, with the former US president attacking her record and dubbing her \u201cLyin\u2019 Kamala\u201d on his Truth Social platform.\n\n\u201cLyin\u2019 Kamala Harris destroys everything she touches!\u201d he wrote on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nRepublicans also have tried to blame Harris for the high number of migrants and asylum seekers crossing the US-Mexico border during Biden\u2019s term in office \u2013 a key election issue \u2013 and called her the administration\u2019s \u201cborder czar\u201d.\n\nBut experts have slammed that criticism as false and noted that Harris is not in charge of US border policies. Biden tasked her in 2021 with addressing the \u201croot causes\u201d of migration to the US from Central America.\n\nFor her part, Harris has hit back at Trump and stressed some of the key issues she plans to campaign on, namely access to reproductive healthcare, economic opportunity and a defence of democratic institutions.\n\n\u201cWe are running a people-powered campaign,\u201d she said during Tuesday afternoon\u2019s rally in Milwaukee. \u201cAnd because we are a people-powered campaign, that is how you know we will be a people-first presidency.\u201d\n\nEchoing a speech she made to campaign staff and volunteers in Delaware a day earlier, Harris said US voters face a choice in November between \u201ctwo different visions\u201d for the country: \u201cone where we are focused on the future; the other focused on the past\u201d.\n\nShe said building up the middle class would be a \u201cdefining goal\u201d of her presidency and pledged to give all Americans the chance \u201cnot just to get by, but to get ahead\u201d.\n\nThe former California attorney general also reiterated that her history of prosecuting \u201cpredators\u201d, \u201cfraudsters\u201d and \u201ccheaters\u201d would serve her well in the campaign.\n\n\u201cHear me when I say, I know Donald Trump\u2019s type,\u201d she said on Tuesday. \u201cAnd in this campaign, I promise you I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week.\u201d\n\nTrump has been convicted of falsifying business records, found civilly liable for sexually abusing a magazine columnist and indicted in two criminal cases related to efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nHe has rejected any wrongdoing and said he is the victim of a politically motivated \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d.",

        "text": "The impact of election stress: Is political anxiety harming your health?\nOn the surface, basic strategies for regulating emotions can work to reduce stress about politics. Ford and her colleagues found that after the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton voters who reframed their negative thoughts about the election outcome using cognitive reappraisal techniques had better emotional well-being (Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Vol. 117, No. 5, 2019).\n\nBut the benefits came at a cost because those respondents were also less motivated to take political action. A follow-up study replicated the results, finding that emotion regulation strategies (including distraction and reframing) improved well-being but reduced political engagement (Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Vol. 125, No. 1, 2023).\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a trade-off between reducing negative emotions about politics, which is a perfectly reasonable goal, and the motivation to be politically active,\u201d Ford said.\n\nThose findings beg the question: \u201cIs there a way of regulating the negative emotions politics triggers so politics doesn\u2019t impair our well-being, but at the same time, doesn\u2019t decrease our motivation to take action?\u201d said psychologist Matthew Feinberg, PhD, an associate professor of organizational behavior at the University of Toronto and a collaborator of Ford\u2019s.\n\nThe team\u2019s latest research is exploring whether the positive emotions politics can evoke\u2014things like admiration, compassion, inspiration, and gratitude\u2014can be used to motivate voters to action without raising their stress levels. So far, the study is yielding promising results.\n\n\u201cJust as negative emotions help drive us to take action, so too do our positive emotions,\u201d Ford said. \u201cThese kinds of socially engaged emotional experiences appear to help push people to get involved, but with less cost to their well-being.\u201d\n\nThose results are echoed by recent reports. The election may be a source of stress for more U.S. adults this year, but they also plan to volunteer and contribute more to causes they value, according to APA\u2019s Stress in America survey. Fifty-one percent of adults planned to do so, compared to 45% prior to the 2020 presidential election.\n\nSocial connection clearly makes a difference, but some social ties are more helpful than others, according to research on partisanship by Costas Panagopoulos, PhD, a professor of political science at Northeastern University in Boston, and his colleagues.\n\nIn polarized communities, they found that bonding ties, or bonds between people who are similar (in this case, politically similar), were linked with better physical and mental health (International Political Science Review, Vol. 75, No. 3, 2022). Bridging ties\u2014connections with dissimilar people\u2014were associated with worse overall health for people who were politically isolated.\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re worried, we have an instinct to isolate ourselves, but we have to reach out and connect,\u201d said Steven Stosny, PhD, a clinical psychologist, consultant, and author based in Washington, D.C., who works with individuals and couples experiencing stress around politics and daily news.",

        "text": "Biden's pick Kamala Harris has Democrats' support. What happens next in US election?\nBiden's pick Kamala Harris has Democrats' support. What happens next?\n\nGetty Images\n\nPresident Joe Biden has dropped out of the US election race and announced his support for Vice-President Kamala Harris as the Democratic Party's nominee. The decision threw the party into uncharted waters, although Ms Harris appears to have quickly gained the support necessary to become the party's official candidate for president. But nothing is yet set in stone, including the question of who she might pick as an election running mate.\n\nIs Biden still the US president?\n\nYes, he has only ended his campaign to be re-elected to the White House on 5 November. He has pledged to remain president until his successor is formally inaugurated in January. However, Mr Biden faces calls from senior Republicans to step down now.\n\nIs Kamala Harris now the Democrats\u2019 presidential candidate?\n\nIt was not guaranteed that Ms Harris would simply take Mr Biden's place as the Democrats' nominee for president, despite having his backing. However, she now appears to have an unassailable level of support within her party. Her backers include other leading figures who might have mounted a challenge for the nomination and, crucially, from party delegates. Delegates are people selected to represent their electoral area at the Democratic National Convention (DNC), the party's key nominating event, which starts on 19 August. After Mr Biden announced he was dropping out of the race for the White House, hundreds of delegates whose support he had won switched to Ms Harris. A tally by the Associated Press said she passed the required number of 1,976 the next day. Their pledges of support are non-binding until the DNC, but their votes are unlikely to change. The situation triggered by Mr Biden's decision is unusual. The last time an incumbent US president abandoned their campaign for re-election was Lyndon Baines Johnson in 1968.\n\nCould other candidates come forward and how will the nominee be confirmed?\n\nAs calls grew for Mr Biden to drop out of the race, a number of potential replacements emerged. But no serious contender has mounted a challenge against Ms Harris. Something strengthening the VP's hand is the fact that a number of Mr Biden's rumoured replacements have rallied behind her. They include Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, California Governor Gavin Newsom, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. Ms Harris could either be confirmed by a procedural vote at the convention or in a virtual \"roll call\" run by the party ahead of the gathering. The Associated Press has reported that this could happen 12 days before the convention. Or, in the increasingly unlikely event that the Democratic Party does not unite behind a single candidate, we could see an open convention for the first time in decades. Delegates would be free to decide who to vote for among multiple candidates. Candidates would need signatures from at least 300 delegates - no more than 50 coming from one state - for their name to appear on the ballot. There would be an initial round of voting among the 3,900 pledged delegates, which includes voters deemed loyal to the Democratic Party. If no candidate received a majority of votes after this first round, then more rounds of voting would take place. These rounds would include superdelegates, party leaders and elected officials, who would all cast ballots until a nominee is chosen.\n\nHow does the winning candidate make their VP pick?\n\nThis tends to be a less formal process than the choice of presidential nominee, with the person selected by the nominee generally accepted as their running mate. If Ms Harris does take Mr Biden\u2019s place at the top of the Democratic ticket, some of the names being discussed as her running mate include some of the prominent Democrats now backing her, including Mr Shapiro, and others such as Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Arizona Senator Mark Kelly. Her running mate would become her future vice-president if she wins office.\n\nWhat happens with the money pledged to Biden?",

        "text": "Ask an expert: Harris 2024? Here\u2019s what election and campaign finance laws say\nUNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. \u2014 President Joe Biden announced he is dropping out of the 2024 presidential race, leaving Vice President Kamala Harris the top contender for the Democratic nomination. Biden\u2019s decision not to seek re-election comes after the states held their presidential primaries and his campaign raised tens of millions of dollars.\n\nWhat happens now that the presidential primaries are over, but the winning candidate has decided not to seek office? And if Harris becomes the official nominee, can she use the money that the Biden-Harris campaign raised? Penn State News turned to two experts to discuss the historical precedent and what election and campaign finance laws say about the sudden change to the Democratic ticket.\n\nQ: Has a presidential candidate ever dropped out mid-race in U.S. history?\n\nRobert Speel, associate professor of political science at Penn State Behrend, studies American elections and voting behavior, state and urban politics, Congress and the presidency, public policy and ethnic and racial politics.\n\nSpeel: There were no primary elections prior to the 20th century, so I assume there were presidential candidates who let it be known they would welcome the nomination but dropped out some time before the convention during the 19th century. And even during most of the 20th century, presidential primaries were not that important, held by only 10-15 states, and served only to demonstrate potential candidate popularity to the national convention delegates, who were mostly still chosen by state party leaders at a state convention.\n\nSince the modern presidential primary process began in the 1970s, there has not yet been a presidential candidate who dropped out after winning a majority of delegates in primary elections, so Biden is the first.\n\nIn 1968, when primaries were mostly symbolic, Lyndon B. Johnson (LBJ) had not officially announced yet whether he was running for re-election, but still won the New Hampshire Democratic primary with write-in votes. Yet LBJ finished with under 50% of the vote, due to large support for anti-war candidate Eugene McCarthy, and soon after, LBJ announced that he would not seek re-election that year. The situation with President Biden is very different due to the change in importance of primary elections.\n\nQ: If Vice President Harris becomes the official nominee, could she use the funds raised by the Biden-Harris campaign?\n\nStanley Brand, distinguished fellow in law and government, studies election law, the campaign finance system, the electoral college and the conduct of contested elections. Affiliated with both Dickinson Law and Penn State Law, he also served as general counsel to the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nBrand: There are competing interpretations of federal election law on this question. The Biden re-election committee has already set in motion the transfer of funds to the Harris campaign by filing amended Federal Election Commission (FEC) forms changing the committee name to \u201cHarris for President.\u201d Some Republican lawyers have questioned this, asserting that this can\u2019t be done before the nominating convention, while Democratic lawyers maintain that the committee is for both Biden and Harris and her committee can keep it as long as she is still on the ticket. Normally this could be resolved by either an advisory opinion by or a complaint to the FEC, but that body is split 3-3 Republican to Democrat and so a stalemate is likely. While a lawsuit could be filed there are both timing and jurisdictional issues that might prevent a timely resolution of such a suit. It is an untested issue like so many we have seen in the Trump era.\n\nQ: Now that the presidential primaries are over, how will the Democratic Party choose its nominee? What does election law say about the process?\n\nSpeel: In coming weeks, we will see Kamala Harris choose a vice-presidential candidate. We will see if she chooses a running mate who excites and galvanizes the Democratic base \u2014 and some independents, the way her candidacy has so far \u2014 or if she chooses someone experienced and safe, like Hillary Clinton did with Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia in 2016, and Barack Obama with Biden in 2008, and Michael Dukakis with Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas in 1988. I expect that Republican lawsuits to try to prevent the Democratic National Convention from nominating anyone other than Joe Biden will fail. There is nothing in any law or in the U.S. Constitution regulating how political parties choose candidates, other than campaign contribution limits.\n\nBrand: One other question has been raised by some Republicans about challenging the process involved in endorsing Harris upon Biden\u2019s dropping out. The claim is that voters have been disenfranchised by this switch. This challenge, if made, is unlikely to succeed legally because the voters cast ballots for delegates to the convention who were pledged to Biden but who are \u201cunbound\u201d if the candidate withdraws, allowing them to vote for another person at the convention; and the Supreme Court has held that political parties control the nominating process, and they are entitled to manage how they arrive at a nominee as an incident of their First Amendment associational rights.\n\nFor more information or to speak with one of our election experts, contact mediarelations@psu.edu.",

        "text": "UK readies for new US presidential race\nUK readies for new US presidential race\n\nAnd yet an hour or so later, the president appeared in command at a lengthy news conference.\n\nPresident Biden was barely audible and mumbling - and managed to call Rishi Sunak \u201cMr President.\u201d\n\nThe president and a prime minister half his age, Mr Sunak, sat yards away from each other and from us.\n\nA year ago, I was in the Oval Office of the White House, and I would get to witness it first hand myself.\n\n\"He was really struggling. His mind drifting. He would have moments where he was lucid, but then things would drift off.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll this stuff about the president being too old said by the Trump lot. I never really believed it, but then I heard him,\" this person said.\n\nIt was the best part of a couple of years ago, and a senior government figure was confiding in me about listening in on a call between the then prime minister and President Biden.\n\n\u201cI thought, blimey. It turns out you don\u2019t need to be one of Donald Trump\u2019s megafans to think it.\u201d\n\nBut in recent weeks, things seem to have deteriorated.\n\nThere was the disastrous presidential debate for Joe Biden against Mr Trump.\n\nAnd then that excruciating moment at the Nato summit in Washington.\n\nEvery day in politics, people claim there has been some deeply awkward, embarrassing moment for this politician or another. Most are mildly blush inducing - and almost certainly instantly forgettable.\n\nBut not this one.\n\nWe had just witnessed a jaw dropper, as President Biden managed to introduce President Zelensky of Ukraine, standing next to him, as President Putin.\n\n\u201cThat was quite a thing, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d a different senior UK government figure said to me, with a knowing look. \u201cThat\u2019ll be consequential, without question.\u201d\n\nIt would be mortifying for anyone at any time, but its political danger for President Biden was obvious to us all because it appeared to illustrate a charge he was now finding impossible to escape: that he was simply too old to stand for re-election.\n\nIt was a theme that had dominated Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s first trip to America as prime minister.\n\nI asked him about that moment just after it happened, and had asked him whether the president was senile the day before.\n\nI didn\u2019t use that word lightly.\n\nIt was what an increasing number of people were implying publicly and many had said privately for some time, and the new prime minister was a character witness.\n\nOK, but what was he likely to say on camera about the man in the Oval Office, you might reasonably ask.\n\nFair point, but it is my job to ask nonetheless \u2013 and to pose those difficult, blunt questions.\n\nThey mattered because they relate to the sitting president of the United States.\n\nToday, the prime minister paid tribute to President Biden, saying how defence and security has been \u201ccentral\u201d to his leadership, including by leading \u201cus through the Nato council just 10 days or so ago\u201d, which the PM described as a \u201creally important Nato summit\u201d.\n\nAnd Sir Keir said he looked forward to \u201cworking with him [President Biden] for the remainder of his presidency\".\n\nThere'll be plenty for the two men to discuss and decide in the coming months.\n\nBut the race between Donald Trump and the - as yet unconfirmed - Democrat candidate will be occupying the minds of Westminster strategists and planners now, as they assess what shape the so-called special relationship will take in 2025.\n\nThe nub of it is - the new UK government now knows it will be dealing with a new administration in Washington within six months, whatever happens.",

        "text": "Four Takeaways on Electoral Conditions Ahead of Venezuela\u2019s 2024 Presidential Election\nAs Venezuela gears up for presidential elections on July 28, the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA) invited two experts to discuss the electoral conditions that may define the outcome. Eugenio Mart\u00ednez, director of Votoscopio, and Griselda Colina, director general of the Global Observatory on Communication and Democracy (Observatorio Global de Comunicaci\u00f3n y Democracia) shared timely insights and concerns about the election process in Venezuela.\n\nAlthough the government and the opposition Unitary Platform had signed the Barbados Agreement on Electoral Conditions in October of last year, this election is not taking place under free and fair conditions. Venezuela\u2019s authoritarian government has banned candidates and imposed restrictions that raise serious concerns about the fairness of the electoral process. Nonetheless, the opposition and civil society remain committed to mobilizing in hopes of ushering in a democratic transition.\n\nHere are the main takeaways from our conversation:\n\n1. Electoral Observation\n\nAs Eugenio Mart\u00ednez explained, the transparency of the electoral process rests on three pillars: the work of the poll watchers, international and national observers, and members of each \u201ctable\u201d or voting station.\n\nTraditionally, national observers have played an important role since they have the capacity to deploy a larger mission throughout the territory, and have expert knowledge of the electoral procedure and dynamics at the local level. For this electoral process, the Observatorio Venezolano Electoral (OEV) was not accredited by the National Electoral Council to participate as an observer. The Red de Observaci\u00f3n Electoral Asamblea de Educaci\u00f3n (ROAE) received credentials to access voting sites. Some 600 credentials\u2014fewer than what ROAE had requested\u2014were finally delivered last week. There are other three groups that have received credentials and Griselda Colina explained that there is little information about their trajectory as observers: Centro de Estudios Superiores, Proyecto Social, Asociaci\u00f3n Venezolana de Juristas.\n\nWithout formal accreditation but rather in their role as civil society, a coalition of civil society organizations named Red Electoral Ciudadana will carry out independent activities of contextual observation with a human rights perspective. Other organizations will be monitoring restrictions and human rights violations.\n\nThe access of international observation has likewise been limited, with the UN Panel of Electoral Experts and the Carter Center among the only technical observers that received invitations. The Maduro government revoked its invitation to the European Union Electoral Observation Mission this May, citing sanctions applied by its member states. On Monday, Minister of Defense Vladimir Padrino welcomed observers from the Carter Center in Caracas.\n\nAs Venezuela approaches elections, new missions have been announced from Colombia and Brazil. \u201cMore than observation missions, it\u2019s political accompaniment,\u201d according to Mart\u00ednez. They could contribute to the oversight of the transparency of the process, but they are not technical missions. The only two technical international observation missions are the Carter Center and the UN Panel of Electoral Experts.\n\n2. Other Electoral Conditions\n\nAs Eugenio Mart\u00ednez noted, \u201cThe [automated voting] system has been audited, the system will function\u2026 The problem lies in the environment surrounding the voting process.\u201d Meaning, the electronic voting system is secure, but there are other irregularities that undermine the transparency of the process and that could become more acute on the day of the elections. For example, coercion of voters in places controlled by the government, extending the hours in which the polling stations are open, limiting the access of poll watchers and observers, among others.\n\nPoll watchers (testigos) are also crucial to avoid irregularities and to guarantee the scrutiny of the process. They are representatives of the presidential candidates that are present at each voting center, as a guarantee of the transparency of the process. The CNE changed the rules of the game to require that poll watchers be voters at the center in which they perform their role as witnesses of the process, something unprecedented. Despite this new limitation, the opposition was able to request accreditation of at least one poll watcher from the opposition in 98 percent of the 30,026 polling stations nationwide. However, up until the moment of this interview, the CNE had not granted them credentials to be able to conduct their work. The expectation is that those credentials will be issued throughout this week.\n\n3. The International Community\u2019s Role\n\nThe international community\u2019s role in backing Venezuelans\u2019 desire for a competitive election will be very relevant, both during and after the election. President of Brazil Luis In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has been among the most vocal actors in recent days, going as far as dispatching one of his top foreign policy advisors to Venezuela ahead of the vote. Similarly, Iniciativa Democr\u00e1tica de Espa\u00f1a y las Am\u00e9ricas (IDEA) headed by Mexico\u2019s Vicente Fox and other conservative political veterans have announced their wish to attend the election, but it is not clear whether they will be granted access to the country.\n\nThe international community\u2019s reaction to the election results, be it favorable to Maduro or to the opposition, will help color successive negotiations. Should the Maduro government recognize its defeat, negotiations will need to establish conditions for a transfer of power by January 2025. If the Maduro government claims victory despite evidence of irregularities or otherwise disregards the results, international actors are likely to issue a resounding condemnation of the election.\n\n4. Election Results and What Comes Next\n\nAccording to our invited experts, regardless of the official results, the election will likely trigger a complex negotiation process. Eugenio Mart\u00ednez suggests that Venezuela might face a scenario in which the results are not published immediately on the night of July 28. With institutions under the control of the ruling party until the start of the next presidential term in January 2025, the country\u2019s governability remains uncertain.\n\nColina offered another possible panorama in which the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) might accept defeat in the face of a landslide opposition victory. In this scenario, party machinery would turn to preserving its political viability at local and state levels ahead of the upcoming 2025 regional and parliamentary elections. This strategy would depend on party officials\u2019 cost-benefit calculations regarding their long-term political survival.\n\nVenezuelans\u2019 commitment to the right to vote and have autonomy over their destiny calls for international support in the defense of their political rights. Subsequent negotiations, either mediated by Norway or other actors, should aim to re-institutionalize the country, restore the rule of law, and ensure respect for human rights.\n\nFor more information don\u2019t miss our video playlist featuring the latest updates on the Venezuelan elections by our Director for Venezuela, Laura Dib.",

        "text": "AP survey shows Kamala Harris backed by enough delegates to become Democratic nominee\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Vice President Kamala Harris has secured the support of enough Democratic delegates to become her party\u2019s nominee against Republican Donald Trump, according to an Associated Press survey, as top Democrats rallied to her in the aftermath of President Joe Biden\u2019s decision to drop his bid for reelection.\n\nThe quick coalescing behind Harris marked an attempt by the party to put weeks of internecine drama over Biden\u2019s political future behind them and to unify behind the task of defeating Trump with just over 100 days until Election Day. Prominent Democratic elected officials, party leaders and political organizations quickly lined up behind Harris in the day after Biden\u2019s exit from the race and her campaign set a new 24-hour record for presidential donations on Monday.\n\nSeveral state delegations met late Monday to confirm their support for Harris, including Texas and her home state of California. By Monday night, Harris had the support of well more than the 1,976 delegates she\u2019ll need to win on a first ballot, according to the AP tally. No other candidate was named by a delegate contacted by the AP.\n\nCalifornia state Democratic Chairman Rusty Hicks said 75% to 80% of the state\u2019s delegation were on a call Tuesday and they unanimously supported Harris.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve not heard anyone mentioning or calling for any other candidate,\u201d Hicks said. \u201cTonight\u2019s vote was a momentous one.\u201d\n\nStill, the AP is not calling Harris the new presumptive nominee. That\u2019s because the convention delegates are still free to vote for the candidate of their choice at the convention in August or if Democrats go through with a virtual roll call ahead of that gathering in Chicago.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris speaks from the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, Monday, July 22, 2024, during an event with NCAA college athletes.

She promised to \u201cunite our Democratic Party, to unite our nation, and to win this election.\u201d\n\nShe quickly leaned into the themes that will be prominent in her campaign against Trump over the coming 100 days, contrasting her time as a prosecutor with Trump\u2019s felony convictions \u2014 \u201cI know Donald Trump\u2019s type,\u201d she said \u2014 and casting herself as a defender of economic opportunity and abortion access.\n\n\u201cOur fight for the future is also a fight for freedoms,\u201d she said. \u201cThe baton is in our hands.\u201d\n\nThe president called into the meeting from his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, where he is recovering from COVID-19, to lend his support to Harris. He planned to talk about his decision to step aside in an address to the nation later this week.\n\n\u201cThe name has changed at the top of the ticket, but the mission hasn\u2019t changed at all,\u201d Biden said in his first public remarks since announcing his decision to step aside, promising he was \u201cnot going anywhere\u201d and plans to campaign on Harris\u2019 behalf.\n\nBiden said of his decision, \u201cIt was the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nAs he handed off the mantle of leadership to Harris, Biden added: \u201cI\u2019m watching you kid.

The event in Milwaukee will be her first full-fledged campaign event since announcing her candidacy.\n\nThe AP tally is based on interviews with individual delegates, public statements from state parties, many of which have announced that their delegations are supporting Harris en masse, and public statements and endorsements from individual delegates.\n\nLocking up the nomination was only the first item on the staggering political to-do list for Harris after learning of Biden\u2019s plans to leave the race Sunday morning on a call with the president. She must also pick a running mate and pivot a massive political operation that had been built to reelect Biden to boost her candidacy instead.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, Biden\u2019s campaign formally changed its name to Harris for President, reflecting that she is inheriting his political operation of more than 1,000 staffers and war chest that stood at nearly $96 million at the end of June. She added $81 million to that total in the first 24 hours after Biden\u2019s endorsement, her campaign said \u2014 a presidential fundraising record \u2014 with contributions from more than 888,000 donors.\n\nThe campaign also saw a surge of interest after Harris took over, with more than 28,000 new volunteers registered since the announcement \u2014 a rate more than 100 times an average day from the previous Biden reelection campaign, underscoring the enthusiasm behind Harris.\n\nBig-name Harris endorsements Monday, including from Govs. Wes Moore of Maryland, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, J.B. Pritzker of Illinois and Andy Beshear of Kentucky, left a vanishing list of potential rivals.\n\nHouse Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, who had been one of the notable holdouts, initially encouraging a primary to strengthen the eventual nominee, said she was lending her \u201centhusiastic support\u201d to Harris\u2019 effort to lead the party.\n\nHarris, if elected, would be the first woman and first person of South Asian descent to be president.\n\nThe Democratic National Convention is scheduled to be held Aug. 19-22 in Chicago, but the party had announced before Biden dropped out that it would hold a virtual roll call to formally nominate Biden before in-person proceedings begin. The convention\u2019s rules committee is scheduled to meet this week to finalize its nomination process with a virtual vote as soon as Aug. 1, the party announced on Monday, with the process completed by Aug. 7.\n\n\u201cWe can and will be both fast and fair as we execute this nomination,\u201d Jaime Harrison, the Democratic National Committee\u2019s chair, said on a conference call with reporters.\n\nThe party said the virtual roll call would feature multiple rounds of voting on nominees if multiple candidates meet the qualification threshold. To qualify, candidates must have the electronic signatures of 300 convention delegates.\n\n\u2014\n\nAP writers Seung Min Kim and Will Weissert in Washington and Chris Megerian in Wilmington, Delaware, contributed.\n\n___\n\nFollow the AP\u2019s coverage of the 2024 election at https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024.",

        "text": "A coup, fake signatures and deepfakes are the latest conspiracy theories about 2024\nA coup, fake signatures and deepfakes are the latest conspiracy theories about 2024\n\ntoggle caption Kamil Krzaczynski/AFP via Getty Images\n\nPresident Biden\u2019s decision to bow out of the 2024 election followed weeks of pressure from Democrats concerned about his age and ability to win and serve another four years. But conspiracy theorists, right-wing influencers and even some Republican politicians immediately cast Biden\u2019s resignation from the campaign as evidence of something more sinister.\n\nThe flurry of unverified rumors, speculation, and conspiracy theories comes as people are reeling from an onslaught of high-stakes political upheaval, from the assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump on July 13 to Biden\u2019s withdrawal from the race eight days later.\n\nOn the most extreme end, Charlie Kirk of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA and far-right activist Laura Loomer suggested, without evidence, that Biden may be dying or already dead.\n\nOthers, including billionaire hedge fund boss Bill Ackman, raised doubts over the president\u2019s letter announcing his decision, baselessly suggesting his signature wasn\u2019t really his.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nRepublican politicians including U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado speculated about why Biden had not been seen in public since the announcement. On Tuesday, the president emerged from his beach house in Delaware where he had been isolating while recovering from COVID-19. He plans to address the nation on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIf this were a hostage situation, that letter would not qualify as proof of life,\u201d Ackman posted on X on Sunday. (On Tuesday, Ackman shared a post with a video of Biden boarding Air Force One that read in part, \u201cPresident Joe Biden seen in public for the first time in nearly a week, debunking conspiracy theories online.\u201d)\n\nStill others on the right framed Biden\u2019s move as not his at all, but an anti-democratic coup orchestrated by shadowy forces including George Soros, a frequent target of conspiracy theories. In doing so, they cast doubt on the legitimacy of Vice President Harris\u2019 candidacy \u2014 and, ultimately, on the election as a whole.\n\n\u201cThe idea of selecting the Democrat[ic] Party's nominee because George Soros and Barack Obama and a couple of elite Democrats got in a smoke-filled room and decided to throw Joe Biden overboard, that is not how it works,\u201d Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance told the crowd at a rally in Ohio on Monday.\n\nHarris is also being targeted with baseless claims and conspiracy theories, including the long-running falsehood that she\u2019s not really an American citizen, despite the fact she was born in Oakland, Calif. These \u201cbirther\u201d smears came up when she ran for president in 2020 and were amplified by Trump, who previously promoted similar false claims about former president Barack Obama.\n\nAfter any breaking news event, people search for answers that may not be available right away. That information void is a ripe environment for the spread of incorrect and incomplete information, as well as for exploitation by those seeking to gain clout or financial reward by amplifying the wildest theories, said Melissa Ryan, CEO of consulting firm CARD Strategies, which tracks disinformation and extremism.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cThe thing to understand is for folks who live in this cinematic universe, things are never what they seem. It's always a false flag,\u201d said Ryan.\n\nWhen Biden called in to an event with Harris and campaign staff on Monday, some online commentators immediately began to speculate that it was not in fact Biden\u2019s voice, but a deepfake created with artificial intelligence.\n\nSome figures on the right had been pressing the narrative, without evidence, that Biden would be replaced on the Democratic ticket at the last minute since at least last fall. Much of that speculation claimed former first lady Michelle Obama or California Gov. Gavin Newsom would be the replacement nominee. Despite the discrepancy in the details, the reality of Biden stepping out has many of them feeling validated.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s shocking how precisely right you can be, right down to the exact timing,\u201d former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, who was among those who had long suggested Biden would drop out, posted on X on Sunday.\n\nThere is little downside to this kind of speculation, which can boost an influencer\u2019s profile whether or not their claims pan out.\n\n\u201cThe truth is, you know, sometimes things change. It doesn't mean that, oh, the conspiracy theorists were right all along. It means everyone was working with the information they knew to be true,\u201d Ryan said.\n\nWhen speculation does line up with reality \u2014 even imperfectly \u2014 that creates opportunity to build trust and expand their audience.\n\n\u201cWe've been seeing that in a lot of different contexts, whether it's in politics or astrology even on the internet, of people trying to say like, \u2018Oh, we knew that this was going to happen,\u2019 and that assigns some sort of authority to your voice,\u201d said Danielle Lee Tomson, research manager at the University of Washington\u2019s Center for an Informed Public.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cLike, \u2018I had inside information or some sort of analytic ability to understand that this was going on. So, you know, you can trust me on this future information that I might help you process or make sense of\u2019,\u201d she said.\n\n",

A day earlier, President Joe Biden bowed out of the contest and endorsed her for the election to the top post. Harris also received \"enthusiastic support\" from former speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi as well as Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts - both powerful Democrat leaders.Biden's endorsement, as well as the paucity of time before the November 5 presidential election, tilted the scales in favour of the Indian-origin vice-president, said experts tracking developments.Harris, as vice-president, met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in September 2021, during his visit to the US, and recently spoke with leader of the opposition Rahul Gandhi.The first woman and first person of colour to hold the US vice-president's post, she is the frontrunner for being named the Democratic Party nominee at its convention, to be held during August 19-22 in Chicago, said experts.Notably, however, Harris is yet to get support from former president Barack Obama In a post on X, she wrote, \"On behalf of the American people, I thank Joe Biden for his extraordinary leadership as President of the United States and for his decades of service to our country. I am honoured to have the President's endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination.\"Democratic National Committee chairman Jaime Harrison issued a statement shortly after Biden dropped out of the race, saying the Democrats would \"undertake a transparent and orderly process to move forward as a united party, with a candidate who can defeat Donald Trump in November.\"A Washington Post article said, \"If a virtual roll call doesn't show a clear majority backing Harris, the party is likely to hold a mini-primary at the convention. The convention may also serve as the venue for the formal announcement of a new vice-presidential nominee.\"The convention is expected to be attended by 50,000 people.Meanwhile, Harris' campaign team kickstarted its preparations, while the Biden-Harris campaign on Sunday formally amended filings with the Federal Election Commission, saying it was renaming its principal committee 'Harris for President,' CNN reported. The name of the committee is \"different than previously reported,\" it said.\"Vice-President Harris is now a candidate for United States President in the 2024 election and will henceforth be conducting campaign activities only in pursuit of that office,\" the principal committee of the Biden-Harris campaign said in a letter filed with the commission.Support for Harris came almost immediately from the Democratic Party brass, as well as those seen as potential rivals for the nomination, such as California Governor Gavin Newsom.The Congressional Black Caucus PAC, Bill and Hillary Clinton, and Democratic Senate candidates, including Andy Kim of New Jersey, Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland and incumbent Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin were among those to rally behind Harris.",

        "text": "Labor groups begin to unite behind Harris' campaign \u2014 but some holdouts remain\nThe Summary Vice President Kamala Harris has received a number of endorsements from labor unions as she works to earn the Democratic nomination for president.\n\nThose unions include the AFL-CIO, Service Employees International Union (SEIU), the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), among others.\n\nStill, there are some holdouts, signaling that Harris and the Democratic Party have work to do to consolidate support.\n\nMany of America's largest labor unions have now announced their endorsements of Kamala Harris' presidential bid, as the vice president intensifies her campaign for the Democratic nomination.\n\nYet some notable union holdouts remain, suggesting Harris will still have some work to do to win over other working-class voters.\n\nOn Monday, the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), the biggest federation of unions in the U.S. and a longtime supporter of President Joe Biden, announced its endorsement of Harris.\n\n\u201cFrom day one, Vice President Kamala Harris has been a true partner in leading the most pro-labor administration in history,\u201d said AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler. \u201cAt every step in her distinguished career in public office, she\u2019s proven herself a principled and tenacious fighter for working people and a visionary leader we can count on. From taking on Wall Street and corporate greed to leading efforts to expand affordable child care and support vulnerable workers, she\u2019s shown time and again that she\u2019s on our side.\u201d\n\nShuler added: \u201cWith Kamala Harris in the White House, together we\u2019ll continue to build on the powerful legacy of the Biden-Harris administration to create good union jobs, grow the labor movement and make our economy work for all of us.\"\n\nSeveral other unions also have announced their support, including the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), the United Food & Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW), the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) in addition to the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and the United Steelworkers (USW).\n\nThe Biden-Harris administration has enjoyed the steady backing of union and labor groups over the past few years and it has sought to reciprocate. In his most high-profile show of support, Biden became the first sitting president to walk a picket line during the United Auto Workers' strike against the Big Three automakers last fall.\n\nBut the UAW is one of the groups that has yet to announce its formal support for Harris' White House bid. On Sunday, it issued a statement praising Biden's leadership during his administration but stopped short of endorsing Harris.\n\n\"The path forward is clear: we will defeat Donald Trump and his billionaire agenda and elect a champion for the working class to the highest office in this country,\" the statement read.\n\nA UAW representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday morning.\n\nRepublican nominee Donald Trump has sought to undermine UAW leadership, explicitly calling for the ouster of its head, Shawn Fain.\n\nDuring his nomination acceptance speech in Milwaukee last week, Trump claimed, without evidence, that China was planning to build auto manufacturing sites in Mexico at the expense of assembly lines in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe United Auto Workers ought to be ashamed for allowing this to happen and the leader of the United Auto Workers should be fired immediately,\" Trump said, adding: \"Every single autoworker, union and nonunion, should be voting for Donald Trump because we\u2019re going to bring back car manufacturing and we\u2019re going to bring it back fast.\"\n\nThere remain dozens of automotive manufacturing plants in the U.S., many of which are in Southern states and the Midwest.\n\nTrump has also sought to exploit the UAW's concerns about the national transition to electric vehicles \u2014 something that caused the union to decline to explicitly support Biden's 2024 candidacy.\n\n\u201cThe federal government is pouring billions into the electric vehicle transition, with no strings attached and no commitment to workers,\u201d Fain said last spring, according to CNBC. \u201cThe EV transition is at serious risk of becoming a race to the bottom. We want to see national leadership have our back on this before we make any commitments.\u201d\n\nThe UAW has historically seen a steady 60-40 split between Democrat- and Republican-supporting members, according to Brian Rothenberg, a former UAW communications director and now a partner at Triumph Communications firm.\n\nHe said that while UAW members remain uneasy about the EV transition, there are other concerns about workplace safety, and especially the impact of Project 2025, a conservative blueprint that lays out actions to weaken public-sector unions.\n\n\"That's a much more robust issue for them than perhaps for the rest of the country,\" Rothenberg said.\n\nUAW members have attended and participated in Trump events in Michigan, CNBC reported last year.\n\nThis past weekend, Trump and running mate JD Vance appeared at a rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, to bolster support in the crucial swing state.\n\nWhile UAW leadership has at least formally rejected Trump, another major union player has explicitly signaled its presidential endorsement is up for grabs.\n\nSean O'Brien, the head of the Teamsters Union, gave an impassioned speech against corporate interests at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee last week that caused some commentators to question whether labor is now as fully united behind Democrats as they have traditionally been.\n\n\"I refuse to keep doing the same things my predecessors did,\" O'Brien said. \"Today, the Teamsters are here to say we aren\u2019t beholden to anyone or any party. We will create an agenda and work with a bipartisan coalition ready to accomplish something real for the American worker. I don\u2019t care about getting criticized. It\u2019s an honor to be the first Teamster in our 121-year history to address the Republican National Convention.\"\n\nA since-deleted post on X from the official Teamsters account in the wake of the speech appeared to signal internal rancor about O'Brien's appearance.\n\n\u201cUnions gain nothing from endorsing the racist, misogynistic, and anti-trans politics of the far right, no matter how much people like Sen. Hawley attempt to tether such bigotry to a cynical pro-labor message,\u201d the Teamsters account wrote on X, referring to the Republican senator from Missouri, Josh Hawley, then adding: \u201cYou don\u2019t unite a diverse working class by scoffing at its diversity.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, a Teamsters representative said the group has invited Harris to a roundtable discussion, and noted that its presidential endorsement are traditionally announced after the political parties' conventions.\n\n\"We are on our timeline and continuing to engage our members in this process,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThe Democrats will host their convention in Chicago next month.\n\nWhile Biden has been generally pro-labor, seeking to increase manufacturing jobs and improve workers' bargaining power by banning noncompete agreements, active union membership has stayed on its historical downtrend during his term.\n\nYet even as Republicans have begun to pursue working-class and factory workers more aggressively, there is currently an effort underway to dismantle the National Labor Relations Board, the government body in charge of settling labor disputes.\n\nThe biggest backer of that initiative is Elon Musk, the head of Tesla, who has pledged his full support to Trump.\n\nMusk, who earned praise from Trump at the Michigan rally, was sanctioned by the NLRB for tweeting in 2018: \u201cNothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union ... But why pay union dues & give up stock options for nothing?\u201d\n\nMore recently, Tesla became the subject of an NLRB complaint in May that accused the company of discouraging its employees \"from forming, joining, or assisting the Union or engaging in other concerted activities.\" An initial hearing in that dispute is scheduled for this month.\n\nA Tesla representative could not be reached for comment.",

        "text": "Poll: Presidential race hits a reset with Harris vs. Trump\nPoll: Presidential race hits a reset with Harris vs. Trump\n\ntoggle caption Kamil Krzaczynski/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe 2024 presidential campaign has hit a reset with more voters moving into the undecided camp now that Kamala Harris is potentially the Democratic nominee, a new NPR/PBS News/Marist poll finds.\n\nHarris and former President Donald Trump are statistically tied, but 1 in 5 independents, including almost 3 in 10 independent women, now say they are undecided. So these next few weeks will be vital for Harris to reintroduce herself before views solidify.\n\nThe survey also found that Democrats are feeling better about their chances now, and Black voters, in particular, say they are more fired up to vote.\n\nBut both Harris and Trump have work to do with key voting groups, from younger and nonwhite voters for Trump; and independents, suburban and white voters overall for Harris.\n\nAs for Biden\u2019s decision to step aside in the presidential race, Americans overwhelmingly agree with his choice, and two-thirds think he should serve out his term in office and not resign.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nLoading...\n\nHarris and Trump are statistically tied\n\nIn a head-to-head matchup, Trump gets 46%, while Harris is at 45%, with 9% undecided. In Marist\u2019s survey earlier this month, just 2% were undecided between Trump and Biden. The poll of 1,309 adults was conducted Monday via online research panels. It has a +/- 3.2 percentage point margin of error, meaning results could be roughly 3 points higher or lower.\n\nIn a five-way contest, Trump and Harris each get 42%, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. pulls in 7%, the lowest since Marist has been testing him since April, and independent Cornel West and the Green Party\u2019s Jill Stein get just 1%.\n\nNotably, Harris holds onto Gen Z/Millennial voters and nonwhite voters more so than Biden was able to when the contest moves from a head-to-head with Trump to one with third-party choices. Earlier this month, Biden declined 13 points with those younger voters and 10 points with nonwhite voters. Harris, on the other hand, largely retains her support with those groups.\n\nSignificant numbers of various groups have now moved into the undecided category\n\nWith more folks undecided, there's an opportunity for Harris that Biden did not seem to have. It's another key indication of just how much of a restart this move is for the campaign.\n\nLoading...\n\nDemocrats overwhelmingly want Harris to be the nominee\n\nBy a 77%-22% margin, Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say they want her to be the nominee.\n\nBlack voters were the most likely of any subgroup to say they were more likely to vote now that Biden has stepped aside \u2013 50% said so. Latinos (46%) and voters aged 18-29 (43%) were also among the most likely to say they are more likely to vote now.\n\nAmericans agree Biden made the right choice in not running for reelection, but most think he should finish out his presidency\n\n87% said stepping aside was the right thing to do, including 87% of Democrats and Republicans, as well as 90% of independents.\n\nTwo-thirds (68%) think Biden should finish out his term. Republicans are largely split, with 53% saying he should resign and 47% saying he should serve out his term.\n\nA plurality said the decision puts Democrats in a better position to win\n\nBy a 41%-24% margin, Americans said Biden\u2019s decision increases Democrats\u2019 chances this fall. A third said it makes no difference.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nTwo-thirds of Democrats (65%) said it increases their chances. More independents also think so, 38%, vs. 21% who think it doesn\u2019t. A plurality of Republicans (42%) think it won\u2019t make a difference, and more of them believe it will hurt rather than help (36%-21%).\n\nHarris starts with a net-negative favorability rating, but slightly better than Trump\n\nHarris gets a 40%-44% positive-to-negative rating, while 15% either haven\u2019t heard of her or were unsure. Trump gets a 43%-49% rating with 8% unsure.\n\n\n\nIn the last Marist survey, Biden\u2019s unfavorable rating was 7 points worse than Harris.\n\nTrump may be seeing a marginal convention bounce, as his unfavorability rating is 4 points lower than Marist\u2019s survey taken before the convention.\n\nBlack voters have among the highest favorability ratings of Harris of any group \u2013 61%. White evangelical Christians (73%) and men without college degrees (62%) give Trump among his highest ratings. Those numbers show which voters likely make up the strongest portions of each candidate\u2019s base of support.\n\nThis is a critical period for Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, Trump\u2019s VP pick, because lots of people haven\u2019t formed an opinion of him yet\n\nForty-one percent have either never heard of him or are unsure. Just 28% have a favorable opinion, while 31% have a negative one.\n\nThere\u2019s no consensus about a vice-presidential pick, because they are largely unknown\n\nTwenty-one percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents would like to see Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, and another 21% favor Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg as a VP pick. They\u2019re followed by Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (17%), Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly (13%), North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (8%), Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker (7%), Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear (6%) and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (6%).\n\nColored by partisanship, Biden\u2019s presidential legacy is not seen as a positive one\n\nHalf of those surveyed say Biden will be remembered as either below average or one of the worst presidents in history (31% said one of the worst, 19% said below average). A quarter said average, another quarter said above average or one of the best presidents.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThere are very different views by party, though, with 85% of Republicans and 57% of independents saying Biden would be seen as below average or one of the worst, while 55% of Democrats saying above average or one of the best.\n\nFor context, when Trump left office, larger numbers \u2013 60% \u2013 said he would go down as below average or one of the worst. In 2016, 40% of respondents said former President Barack Obama would be seen as one of the best or above average, compared to 31% who said below average or one of the worst.\n\nDigging into the numbers, Harris has work to do among independents, suburban voters and white voters\n\nHarris only pulls in 32% of independents in a match-up against Trump, while Biden got 46% in Marist\u2019s last survey. She only gets 40% of white voters, compared to Biden\u2019s 47%; and only 42% of small city/suburban women, compared to 58% for Biden.\n\nTrump now leads with suburban voters, 50%-42%, when Biden had led previously, 56%-42%.\n\nBut Harris has an opportunity to convince these voters, as 1-in-5 independents (21%) are now undecided, compared to just 4% previously; 11% of small city/suburban women are also undecided, compared to 2% in the last poll; as are of suburban voters, compared to 2% previously; and 7% of white voters, only 2% of whom said so earlier this month.\n\nTrump, though, sees declines with younger voters, nonwhites and those without degrees",

The Democrats will hold their national convention to pick their presidential nominee in August. Vice-President Kamala Harris is a favorite to replace Biden and is expected to receive the nomination. There might be some opposition to his nomination.President Joe Biden has endorsed Kamala Harris. After the news of Biden\u2019s decision to quit the race, there are questions regarding Harris\u2019s running mate . There are many candidates being considered as Harris\u2019 running mate. Here is the complete list of probable candidates.The Governor of Kentucky has his political acumen which will come handy for the party. The state had overwhelmingly voted for Trump in 2016. It is under these circumstances that Beshear won the election in 2019 by beating a candidate endorsed by Trump.He is presently the Transport Secretary in the Biden administration. He was a mere mayor in the city of South Bend in the state of Indiana. He had put up a good competition against Biden in the party\u2019s primaries in 2020. He is the first individual to become a secretary belonging to the LGBTQIA community. He has openly declared his orientation.The North Carolina Governor won the contest in 2016 and 2020 when the state voted in favor of Trump. Appointing him as Harris\u2019 running mate could help the Democrats win the state under tense circumstances when the party will have to win critical states during the election.Mark Kelly is among the front runners to serve as Harris\u2019 running mate. The Senator from Arizona was earlier even a choice to replace Biden, according to one such surveys.He is presently the Maryland Governor. He was in the news for the handling of the Baltimore bridge collapse. During a recent meeting between the Governors and Biden, he led the meeting.The Governor of California is from the same state as Kamala Harris. He is also a probable candidate to replace Joe Biden. His record in the administration may work against him. The state of California has the challenge of increasing crimes and homelessness.He is a Governor of the critical state of Illinois. He has an estimated net worth of $3.5 billion and could self-finance his campaign. He is expected to host the Democratic Governors in August during the party\u2019s national convention.He serves as the Governor of Pennsylvania. Like Kamala Harris, he served as an Attorney. The state is one of the swing states and appointing him as a running mate may help the party win a critical swing state.She is the Governor of Michigan and also serves as the co-chair of the Biden-Harris campaign. She is also one of the candidates to replace Joe Biden. Her credentials are strong and she could emerge as the running mate of Kamala Harris.The former president has not endorsed any candidate after joe Biden quit the race. Many have called on Michelle Obama to replace Joe Biden on the ballot box.She remains the favorite among all the Democrats to replace Joe Biden on the ballot box. There may be opposition to her candidature from some quarters.",

        "text": "What pushed President Biden to withdraw from the reelection race?\nPressure from his own party to step aside grew despite White House assurances.\n\nJust two days after announcing he was prepared to return to the campaign trail, President Joe Biden announced Sunday that he is dropping out of the race, taking members of his staff by surprise.\n\n\"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,\" Biden said in his statement. \"And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.\"\n\nBiden's decision to withdraw from the reelection campaign came in the wake of repeated White House statements, and declarations from Biden himself, that he would remain in the race and was confident that he could defeat former President Donald Trump's reelection bid. Yet those assurances did little to decrease the public pressure from an increasing number of his fellow Democrats for Biden to move aside in favor of a stronger candidate.\n\nSome 48 hours after Biden, who is recovering from COVID-19, said he would return to the stump this week, the pressure from those in his own party for him to withdraw from the race continued to mount.\n\nNot only did the list of Democratic congressional members echoing the call for Biden to withdraw grow to at least 40, staunch Biden supporters like Sen. Joe Manchin, I-W.Va., upped their public calls for the 81-year-old president to end his presidential campaign.\n\nJust before Biden announced that he was stepping aside and endorsing his vice president, Kamala Harris, to lead his party's ticket, Manchin went on ABC's \"This Week\" and encouraged Biden \"to pass the torch to a new generation.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden pauses as he speaks at a news conference on the final day of the NATO summit in Washington, DC, July 11, 2024. Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n\n\"He will go down with a legacy unlike many people, as one of the finest and truly a [patriotic] American,\" Manchin said. \"So, with that, I come with a heavy heart to think the time has come for him to pass the torch to a new generation.\"\n\nBiden's decision came just eight days after Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer visited Biden in his Rehoboth, Delaware, beach home and had a heart-to-heart talk with Biden about leaving the race, sources told ABC News Chief Washington correspondent Jon Karl.\n\nSources further told ABC News that Biden's own staff didn't know Biden was stepping down until just one minute before he publicly announced his decision on Sunday, leaving some members of the president's staff blindsided by the decision.\n\nIn the end, first lady Jill Biden played a supportive role but left it up to the president to make the ultimate call, her communications director, Elizabeth Alexander, told ABC News.\n\n\u201cDown to the last hours of the decision only he could make, she was supportive of whatever road he chose,\" Alexander said. \"She\u2019s his biggest believer, champion, and always on his side, in that trusted way only a spouse of almost 50 years can be.\"\n\nVice President Harris did not say in a statement she released Sunday when she learned Biden was stepping aside, focusing instead on praising Biden's leadership.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris join hands in the air after watching the fireworks on the National Mall from the White House balcony, July 4, 2024, in Washington. Samuel Corum/Getty Images\n\n\"On behalf of the American people, I thank Joe Biden for his extraordinary leadership as president of the United States and for his decades of service to our country,\" Harris said. \"His remarkable legacy of accomplishment is unmatched in modern American history, surpassing the legacy of many presidents who have served two terms in office.\"\n\nIn a letter to the nation, Biden didn't elaborate on what thinking may have prompted his decision, saying only \"And while it has been my intention to see reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.\"\n\nBiden's statement also said he would speak later this week to the nation about his decision, which came came 24 days after his disastrous June debate with former President Donald Trump.\n\nJust two days prior to Sunday's announcement, Biden sounded as if he had no plans to withdraw from the reelection race. In a statement Friday, the president said, \"I look forward to getting back on the campaign trail next week to continue exposing the threat of Donald Trump's Project 2025 agenda while making the case for my own record and the vision that I have for America: one where we save our democracy, protect our rights and freedoms, and create opportunity for everyone.\"\n\nBiden\u2019s youngest brother, Frank Biden, told ABC News that his brother\u2019s subsequent decision to withdraw was a \"close call\" reached only after several Biden family members held several discussions over the past week, led by first lady Jill Biden, and that the family has always been supportive of the president doing whatever he thought best for the country.\n\n\u201cIt really boils down to this: it has to do with his overall health and vitality. Not anything cognitive. But he\u2019s a proud guy, it pisses him off that he shuffles when he walks,\" Frank Biden told ABC News.\n\nFrank Biden also said it has \u201cbeen really horrible [for the family] to see the dogs let loose on him,\u201d referring to longtime allies who in recent weeks joined the calls for Biden to drop out of the race.\n\n\u201cJoe has one thing uppermost in his mind. It\u2019s not him, not his ego, not his ambition. He has really reached a place where the only thing that matters to him is the health of this nation,\" Frank Biden said.\n\nA source close to the Biden family disputed Frank Biden's account of President Biden's decision, saying, \"He hasn\u2019t spoken to his brother in weeks. What he said about health being a factor in the president\u2019s decision is completely untrue.\"",

This haul reflects money raised across the campaign, Democratic National Committee and joint fundraising committees,\" a media release said.\n\nOver 8,88,000 grassroots donors made donations in the past 24 hours, 60 per cent of whom made their first contribution of the 2024 cycle, it said, adding, \"Team Harris' 24-hour raise is the highest 24-hour raise of any candidate in history.\"\n\n\"In the last 24 hours, Team Harris has added 43,000 new recurring donors, with over half of these recurring donors signing up for weekly donations. A call on Sunday evening hosted by Win with Black Women raised approximately USD 1.6 million in grassroots contributions alone. And Harris for President\u2019s official social media, @KamalaHQ, doubled its following overnight,\" the campaign said in a statement.\n\nAlso read: Oil drops as investors look past Biden exit, focus on weak fundamentals Reacting to the support for the campaign, Munoz said, \"The historic outpour of support for Vice President Harris represents exactly the kind of grassroots energy and enthusiasm that wins elections.\"\n\n\"Already, we are seeing a broad and diverse coalition come together to support our critical work of talking to the voters that will decide this election,\" he added.\n\nThough Biden's endorsement almost seals Harris' position as the presidential nominee of her party, she still needs to get elected by the party's delegates during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago from August 19-22.\n\nAlso Read | US Elections 2024: Donald Trump donated to Kamala Harris as California lawmaker\n\nAlso read: On Joe Biden\u2019s exit from US presidential race, Antony Blinken says \u2018he delivered historic accomplishments\u2019 Biden has won 3,896 delegates as against 1,976 required to win the party's presidential nomination.\n\nIn a move that would give her access to the campaign funds, the Biden-Harris campaign amended filings with the Federal Election Commission to rename its principal committee and declare Harris a candidate for president.\n\nFollowing Biden's decision, Harris, who has been serving as the US' first female, first Black and first South Asian vice president since 2021, immediately secured the endorsement of former president Bill Clinton, thus making it a bit easier for her to win the delegate battle during the party convention.",

        "text": "Sure, 2024 has had lots of news \u2013 but compared with 1940, 1968 or 1973, it\u2019s nothing exceptional\nHistory usually happens at a leisurely pace, with major events months or even years apart. But this year, it seems like someone has pushed fast-forward, with significant events coming on a weekly or even daily basis. One company is now selling a T-shirt declaring \u201cTHIS IS MY LIVING IN UNPRECEDENTED TIMES SHIRT.\u201d\n\nThe announcement on July 21, 2024, that Joe Biden would withdraw from the presidential race was the latest in a dizzying series of major domestic events in 2024. Here\u2019s a brief list:\n\nWhile 2024\u2019s fast pace of events is rare in American history, it\u2019s not unique.\n\n1968: Assassinations, political turmoil, war\n\nMany observers have already compared 2024 to 1968. Both years saw incumbent Democratic presidents bow out of the election, as well as tragic outbreaks of political violence. But 1968 also saw a rapid unfolding of other historic events. Here\u2019s what happened that year:\n\n1940: War, US draft and FDR\u2019s historic reelection\n\nTwo other years stand out for the rapid pace of significant events. The first is 1940, which was dominated by Nazi Germany\u2019s invasions of European countries, the response to that aggression and a precedent-setting third term for U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\n1973: Abortion, peace deal, Watergate, political mayhem\n\nFinally, 1973 also witnessed a rapid sequence of historic events. The federal right to abortion was guaranteed by the U.S. Supreme Court. The Vietnam War ended after almost 60,000 Americans and millions of civilians were killed. War began in the Middle East. And Congressional hearings commenced in a political scandal that would, the next year, end Nixon\u2019s presidency.\n\nWhat do these years of unprecedented events have in common?\n\nOne factor seems to be that wars and presidential elections seem to generate a cascade of events. Second, important events seem to beget more events. In 1940, the Nazi invasions led to Churchill becoming British prime minister and probably boosted the likelihood of Roosevelt running for and winning a third term.\n\nIn 1968, the Tet offensive helped trigger the challenges to President Johnson, which led to his decision to drop out. That helped set the stage for the calamitous Democratic convention that year.\n\nTrump\u2019s political and legal comebacks this year made Democrats even more desperate for a winning nominee, increasing the pressure on Biden after his poor debate performance.\n\nWe don\u2019t know if the pace of news events this year will begin to slow down. What we do know is that most Americans might appreciate a bit of a breather before encountering another potentially historic event.",

        "text": "July 22, 2024, presidential campaign news\nPresident Joe Biden will end his bid for reelection and has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nDespite Biden\u2019s backing, it remains unclear whether Harris will become the nominee, or what process the party will take to select an alternative.\n\nHere are some answers to frequently asked questions:\n\nDoes Harris just become the nominee? No. While Biden has already endorsed his vice president for the nomination, there\u2019s no succession protocol for the presidential ticket in the way there is for the office. Harris will have to win a majority of the convention just like anyone else.\n\nWhat\u2019s the \u201cvirtual roll call\u201d? Democrats are in the process of setting up a system to conduct their presidential nomination vote remotely before the party\u2019s convention next month.\n\nUnder a plan presented Friday, delegates would get 24 hours\u2019 notice before voting begins, and voting would take place via digital ballots emailed to delegates.\n\nHowever, the party did not take any steps to approve the plan at Friday\u2019s meeting. It\u2019s not yet clear whether the party will stick with the remote vote plan or scrap it and allow the formal vote to happen on the convention floor.\n\nHow would other candidates get into the race? Under party rules, candidates must meet certain requirements to have their names placed into nomination to be the party\u2019s presidential candidate.\n\nThey must gather hundreds of signatures from delegates (at least 300, but not more than 600) from several states.\n\nCandidates also must meet a series of requirements laid out in party rules, including that they are a \u201cbona fide Democrat\u201d and that they have \u201cestablished substantial support for their nomination as the Democratic candidate\u201d for president. While this determination is to be made by the DNC chair, the party has not yet released more details on how eligible candidates would be determined.\n\nWhat are delegates? There are two separate sets of delegates.\n\nThere are 3,949 pledged delegates. These are delegates who were selected through various state-level processes. About 99% of them were pledged to vote for Biden, based on his performance in primaries and caucuses around the country. The individuals who were pledged to vote for Biden were also approved by his campaign.\n\nRoughly 750 (747 as of the last word from the DNC \u2013 this number can change) are automatic delegates. Also known as \u201csuperdelegates,\u201d these are individuals who serve as delegates by virtue of another position they hold or held. These delegates are free to vote for the candidate of their choice, but under normal circumstances, they can\u2019t vote on the first ballot if their votes could impact the results of the nomination (it\u2019s not exactly clear whether they\u2019ll be able to participate on this first ballot in this case.\n\nAre Democratic delegates required to vote for the candidate who won them? No. Under Democratic party rules, pledged delegates \u201cshall in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them.\u201d However, the candidates\u2019 right of review means that delegates can be expected to be loyal to the candidate to whom they\u2019re pledged.\n\nBut now that Biden is no longer a candidate, his delegates are free to vote for whomever they\u2019d like. He doesn\u2019t need to formally \u201crelease\u201d his delegates.",

        "text": "Harris and Trump are tied, poll finds. Here\u2019s why strategists say that\u2019s good for Democrats\nNearly all Americans \u2013 87 percent \u2013 think President Joe Biden\u2019s decision to end his reelection bid was the right thing to do, according to the latest PBS News/NPR/Marist poll. That view crossed ideological, generational and partisan lines, a strong note of unity in a din of national division.\n\nBiden\u2019s decision increases Democrats\u2019 chances of winning the election, said a plurality (41 percent) of Americans. Those who felt this moment would prove a turning point included 65 percent of Democrats, 38 percent of independents and 21 percent of Republicans.\n\nAt the same time, 24 percent said Biden\u2019s decision to exit decreases Democrats\u2019 odds of winning in November, while 34 percent said his move will make no difference, including 42 percent of Republicans.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the policies of the last four years, he hasn\u2019t missed a beat,\u201d Democratic strategist Adam Parkhomenko said. \u201cBut he\u2019s not as quick as he used to be. Four years is a long time.\u201d\n\nRoughly three-quarters of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said Vice President Kamala Harris should be nominated for the top of their ticket in November. Fewer than a quarter said Democrats should find someone else to lead the party. This poll was conducted Monday, as endorsements, campaign donations and pledged delegates began to stack up in support of Harris taking Biden\u2019s place.\n\nIf the election were held today, 46 percent of voters would back Trump, while 45 percent of U.S. registered voters would support Harris, falling well within the margin of error. Compared to the previous PBS News/NPR/Marist poll, taken this month before Biden left the race, support for both Trump and Harris fell by a few points each, while the percentage of undecided voters grew 8 points.\n\nWhether Harris has the ability to attract voters beyond the Democratic Party \u2013 and overcome middling-to-poor public impressions of Biden\u2019s tenure \u2013 is another question. Right now she\u2019s under water for general perception, this poll found, though a significant number aren\u2019t sure what they think of her.\n\nIn this latest poll, 44 percent of U.S. adults said they viewed Harris unfavorably. At the same time, 40 percent said they regarded her favorably, while 15 percent said they were not sure, including 19 percent of independents.\n\nBiden\u2019s exit is far from the only shock to the American political system in the last two weeks. Former President Donald Trump survived an assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania campaign rally two days before the Republican National Convention, where he told his dramatic experience of being shot and paid tribute to other victims.\n\nWith the GOP coming out of a dramatic and unifying Republican National Convention and Democrats experiencing the \u201ceuphoria\u201d of no longer having Biden running, Republican strategist Whit Ayres said it looks \u201clike the two have canceled each other out. There\u2019s no bump for either\u201d Trump or Harris.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right back to a dead-even race,\u201d Ayres said.\n\nBiden\u2019s decision to leave the 2024 race and his legacy\n\nWithin 24 hours of Biden\u2019s withdrawal and endorsement of Harris, the Democratic Party raised more than $81 million, with a majority of donors saying it was their first time giving during this election cycle, according to a Harris campaign email. By Monday, the Associated Press reported from its own unofficial survey that Harris had secured votes from more than 1,976 delegates, enough to become the Democratic Party\u2019s presumptive nominee (although she has not secured that distinction yet).\n\nWATCH: Harris solidifies Democratic support and is favorite to replace Biden on ticket\n\n\u201cI am grateful to President Biden and everyone in the Democratic Party who has already put their faith in me, and I look forward to taking our case directly to the American people,\u201d Harris said in a statement released Monday.\n\nAbout 1 in 3 Americans \u2013 35 percent \u2013 said Biden\u2019s exit made them more likely to cast their ballot in November than they were before he left the race. Those experiencing that new burst enthusiasm include 46 percent of Democrats, 35 percent of Republicans and 28 percent of independents. Overall, a majority of Americans said Biden\u2019s decision didn\u2019t affect their likelihood of voting, which may in part reflect the urgency that many voters were already feeling.\n\nIn a letter Sunday, Biden expressed his great honor in having served in the White House, but that he felt \u201cit is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down\u201d and focus on the remainder of his presidency.\n\nAbout two-thirds of Americans say Biden should finish his term as president, including most Democrats and independents. Republicans were split over whether Biden should resign sooner than next January.\n\nThinking about how history might remember Biden\u2019s time in the Oval Office, 13 percent of U.S. adults viewed him as one of the best presidents in the nation\u2019s history, while 37 percent said he was at or above average.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, 31 percent of Americans said Biden has been among the worst presidents in history. For comparison, 47 percent of Americans felt that way about Trump in January 2021, and 17 percent of Americans said that about former President Barack Obama in December 2016 as he prepared to leave office.\n\nBiden will address the nation on Wednesday and is expected to talk about why he chose this moment to end his reelection campaign.\n\n\u201cWhen Biden speaks tomorrow about his decision, I really think it\u2019s going to be a moment for the country to hear from his heart what a tough, sincere but also probably, at the end of the day, easy decision this was because he cares about his country, his party and his legacy,\u201d Parkhomenko said.\n\nTrump vs. Harris\n\nMore so than for Harris, people have made their minds up about Trump. Eight percent of Americans said they were not sure how they felt about him, compared to Harris\u2019 15 percent. Another 49 percent said they hold an unfavorable view of Trump, while 43 percent find him favorable.\n\nFor Republicans to control the narrative, Ayres said they have \u201cgot to drive home the case that the economy was better when Donald Trump was president than when the Democrats were in office,\u201d adding that is \u201ctheir strongest argument, particularly for non-white respondents.\u201d\n\n\u201cHarris has far more room to grow, and Trump has hit his ceiling.\u201d\n\nHarris\u2019 element of the unknown could prove to be an asset on the campaign trail. In the days ahead, she stands to gain from \u201cexciting waves of news,\u201d Parkhomenko said, including the Democratic National Convention and the selection of her own vice president.\n\nTo keep up the momentum for Harris, Parkhomenko said Democrats need to stay focused and build on the unity forged over the last few days. He also said they must find a balance between debunking disinformation from the Trump campaign, \u201cbut at the same time, highlighting what we\u2019re going to do in the next four years. It\u2019s not just what we\u2019ve done\u201d during the Biden administration.\n\n\u201cHarris has far more room to grow, and Trump has hit his ceiling,\u201d Democratic strategist Tory Gavito said. \u201cTrump is stagnant at 46 percent, and he should be soaring right now.\u201d\n\nThe one sure thing to come out of the last two weeks that have felt like a year in political time: Americans are more interested and engaged in the upcoming presidential election than they\u2019ve been in months.\n\nPBS News, NPR and Marist Poll conducted a survey on July 22 that polled 1,309 U.S. adults with a margin of error of 3.2 percentage points, 1,117 registered voters with a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points, 846 registered voters who definitely plan to vote in November\u2019s general election with a margin of error of 4.0 percentage points and 515 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents with a margin of error of 5.2 percentage points.",

        "text": "Expert: U.S. President Joe Biden has withdrawn from the race. What now?\nOn Sunday, U.S. President Joe Biden announced he was withdrawing from the presidential race and almost immediately endorsed Vice-President Kamala Harris. The move is unprecedented, and with the upcoming Democratic National Convention taking place Aug. 19 to 22, the move has left many wondering what\u2019s next.\n\nWestern News spoke with political science professor Matthew Lebo, whose research focuses on American domestic politics with an emphasis on the presidency, Congress and elections, about what we can expect to see now in the run-up to the U.S. election in November.\n\nWestern News: Is there any precedent for these circumstances? Has this ever happened before?\n\nMatthew Lebo: The closest to a precedent for this was 1968 when Lyndon Johnson announced in March that he would not accept the nomination of the Democratic Party for another term. But Johnson did not endorse anyone and the primaries were not binding, so delegates to the convention were free to vote for whichever candidate they preferred. That led to many months of fighting over the nomination and, ultimately, the fractured party and its candidate, Hubert Humphrey, lost the election.\n\nThere has been talk of a \u2018mini-primary\u2019 \u2013 does this seem likely?\n\nML: A mini-primary seems unlikely at this point. As of Tuesday, enough delegates to the convention have now pledged themselves to Kamala Harris and will have some kind of virtual roll call vote in early August. This essentially makes Vice-President Harris the presumptive nominee going into the convention and avoids a potential battle there. It also makes the next few weeks easier in terms of campaigning, fundraising and choosing a running mate.\n\nWhat does it mean now that President Biden has backed Kamala Harris as the democratic nominee?\n\nML: Despite Biden\u2019s endorsement, Vice-President Harris did not automatically get the delegates that were already pledged to him. However, in the past few days Vice-President Harris became quickly unstoppable; she has been endorsed by nearly all of her potential rivals and the Biden campaign has been handed to her. She has Biden\u2019s organization and his campaign funds, as well as nearly $100 million new dollars.\n\nIf Vice-President Harris is the next democratic nominee, what do you think her chances are?\n\nML: Vice-President Harris should be, at worst, in the same position as Biden was. But she has the potential to do much better. In 2020, Biden won by 7 million votes (and a close electoral college). But polls show a big drop in enthusiasm for Biden that Harris could reverse. She will be a more effective campaigner against Donald Trump, whose chances of winning are a lot lower today than they were two days ago.\n\nWhat about a running mate?\n\nML: Vice-President Harris may settle on a running mate very soon. She will be looking for someone who can help her pull ahead in the close battleground states, most especially Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. The governors of Pennsylvania and Michigan are good bets. There are some others as well. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan is the only woman who is being talked about as a potential running mate so far.\n\nWhat did you make of the Republican response to Biden\u2019s announcement?\n\nML: The message from Donald Trump and the Republicans that they would seek national unity did not last long. They will attack the vice-president and try to tie her to the immigration issue. In his first social media response, Trump said Vice-President Harris is more liberal and more incompetent than President Biden. The Republicans would have preferred Biden to stay in the race.",

        "text": "Who could replace Joe Biden as the 2024 Democratic nominee?\nWashington \u2014 The top of the Democratic ticket was suddenly up for grabs after President Biden rocked the political world by announcing Sunday he is dropping out of the 2024 race.\n\nShortly after the announcement, Mr. Biden backed Vice President Kamala Harris for the Democratic nomination \u2014 calling her selection as vice president \"the best decision I've made,\" and offering \"my full support and endorsement\" \u2014 but he does not have the power to choose his replacement. Harris quickly began to consolidate support from Democratic elected officials and party delegates, and by Monday night had secured enough state delegate support to put her on the path to officially securing the nomination.\n\nEarlier, in addition to Harris, a number of other politicians were viewed as possible contenders. But none have said they would challenge her for the nomination, and several, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, quickly endorsed Harris. Another prominent Democrat, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, made a point of saying, \"my job in this election will remain the same\" before she endorsed Harris on Monday.\n\nHere is a look at some of those Democratic politicians and potential future candidates. Many of these lawmakers could also be considered front-runners to become the nominee for vice president.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris\n\nHarris, 59, the sitting vice president, received a number of major endorsements in the wake of Mr. Biden's decision to step aside, and for many, she's the natural choice. She's the first female vice president and first vice president of color, and it would be politically difficult for the Democratic Party to deny her the nomination, but she must still win the support of the Democratic delegates. On Monday night, her campaign announced she has secured enough delegates to win when those votes are officially cast, expected in early August.\n\nLike Mr. Biden, Harris has been struggling in polling in the battleground states. CBS News polling recently found that GOP nominee and former President Donald Trump leads Vice President Kamala Harris in a hypothetical matchup. There are at best marginal differences in how she and Mr. Biden currently run among demographic groups, such as younger voters and voters of color.\n\nHarris issued a statement saying she is \"honored\" to have Mr. Biden's endorsement and that her \"intention is to earn and win this nomination.\"\n\nShe said she'd continue to travel the country in the coming weeks and would do everything she could to unite the party and the nation to defeat Trump.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia\n\nA close political aide to Sen. Joe Manchin told CBS News on Sunday that the senator was \"considering\" a presidential bid given the latest developments and the outreach from donors urging him to launch a campaign. Some Democratic donors and officials are reaching out to Manchin to consider standing for the presidential nomination, according to two people familiar with the discussions who were not authorized to discuss private deliberations.\n\nBut in an interview Monday on \"CBS Mornings,\" Manchin said he will not enter the race.\n\n\"I am not going to be a candidate for president,\" Manchin said. He said he would like to see a competitive process to choose the nominee.\n\n\"I think a lot of people would like to see a mini primary,\" Manchin said. \"That's the process \u2014 find out if you have the strongest candidate, whether it could be Kamala or whoever else.\"\n\nEarlier Sunday, before Mr. Biden's announcement, Manchin said in an interview on \"Face the Nation\" that the party had a deep bench and it was time for \"a new generation\" to have \"a chance to rise.\"\n\nManchin, who is 76, left the Democratic Party to become an independent in May, but continues to caucus with the Democrats in the Senate.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom of California\n\nNewsom, the governor of the nation's most populous state, has developed a national profile and often positions himself as the Democratic Party's liberal fighter. Newsom, 56, faced off with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in a debate in December, when DeSantis was still seeking the Republican nomination, in a matchup that was billed as a proxy debate over two visions for the country.\n\nBut Newsom has repeatedly indicated that he had \"sub-zero\" interest in entering the contest, and on Sunday he issued a statement endorsing Harris.\n\nAfter Mr. Biden's announcement, Newsom posted a statement praising Mr. Biden's leadership and calling him a \"history-making president.\"\n\n\"He will go down in history as one of the most impactful and selfless presidents,\" Newsom said.\n\nLater Sunday, Newsom posted a statement in support of Harris. \"Tough. Fearless. Tenacious. With our democracy at stake and our future on the line, no one is better to prosecute the case against Donald Trump's dark vision and guide our country in a healthier direction than America's Vice President, @KamalaHarris,\" Newsom wrote.\n\nGov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan\n\nWhitmer's name has been widely discussed as a possible replacement since the presidential debate, but she said soon after Mr. Biden announced his exit that \"my job in this election will remain the same.\"\n\nShe's a popular governor who won reelection by double digits in 2022, while helping to secure a Democratic trifecta in the state, and she's become a leading voice in the party. Whitmer emphasized abortion rights in her reelection effort, and has pushed Mr. Biden to lean more strongly into the issue this year.\n\nWhitmer issued a statement Monday endorsing Harris, and announced she would co-chair the vice president's campaign.\n\nGov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois\n\nLongtime Democrat J.B. Pritzker, 59, has been Illinois governor since 2019 and is now in his second term. He's been a strong voice on issues like gun control and reproductive rights. Pritzker is also a billionaire scion of the family that owns the Hyatt hotel chain. His ability to self-fund a last-minute campaign could make him an appealing choice for the party. Like Newsom, his liberal policies in the deep-blue state could be seen as liability for voters during the general election.\n\nPritzker also offered his endorsement of Harris on Monday.\n\nGov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky\n\nBeshear, 46, enjoys rare popularity as a Democrat in a red state. He came out in support of Harris on Monday.\n\n\"I'm excited to fully endorse Vice President Harris,\" Beshear said on MSNBC. \"The vice president is smart and strong, which will make her a good president.\"\n\nThe son of former Gov. Steve Beshear, he overcame GOP dominance in the state last year to win reelection. He's successfully distanced himself from mainstream Democrats, building a political brand that could make him more broadly acceptable than other in Democrats in a general election.\n\nBeshear said after the debate that he would continue to support the president \"so long as he continues to be in the race.\"\n\nGov. Wes Moore of Maryland\n\nMoore is another rising star in the party, and his national profile rose in recent months as he led Maryland's response to the Baltimore bridge collapse. The 45-year-old, who's the youngest Democratic governor in the country and the only Black governor, has been a surrogate for the Biden reelection bid, campaigning around the country.\n\nMoore said earlier that he would not seek seek the Democratic nomination this year should the president leave the race. He endorsed Harris on Monday after having what he described as \"lengthy\" conversations with both the president and vice president.\n\n\"Vice President Harris has the experience, record, vision, and wisdom to unify the country,\" Moore said in a statement. \"President Biden selected her to serve by his side because he knew she could lead the nation. She will have the unique ability to energize the Democratic Party base and mobilize a unique coalition, and we must rally around her and elect her to serve as the next president of the United States.\"\n\nMoore has also been floated as a possible vice-presidential pick, but he said Tuesday on \"CBS Mornings\" that he had \"no interest\" in joining the ticket.\n\n\"I would do anything to make sure that the vice president becomes the next president of the United States\" Moore said.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota\n\nKlobuchar, 64, who ran against Biden and Harris in the 2020 primaries, has been mentioned as a potential candidate who could find a similar base of support as Mr. Biden, but she told CBS News on Sunday that she is endorsing Harris for the 2024 nomination.\n\nShe called Harris \"an incredibly strong leader who will bring to this office, and to this campaign, the receipts,\" Klobuchar said. \"She, along with President Biden, got our nation through this pandemic, we've seen record job increases. She is someone that knows the work, knows the job. And I also know her as a good person.\"\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg\n\nButtigieg, 42, has already been vetted on the national stage, after running for president in 2020. The Indiana native has proven he can speak to both Democrats and Republicans \u2014 he's one of the few Biden administration officials who appears on Fox News. Buttigieg and his husband, Chasten, have twins who turn 3 in August.\n\nOn Sunday evening, Buttigieg posted on X, \"I will do all that I can to help elect @KamalaHarris the next President of the United States.\" He called her the right person to \"take up the torch.\"\n\nGov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania\n\nShapiro, 51, gained national attention for besting a far-right opponent in the state's 2022 governor's race, allowing Democrats to hold on to the governor's mansion in a key battleground state. Since then, he has navigated a divided government in the state legislature.\n\nFollowing Mr. Biden's announcement, Shapiro issued a statement endorsing Harris for the nomination.\n\n\"Kamala Harris is a patriot worthy of our support and she will continue the work of generations of Americans who came before us to perfect our union, protect our democracy, and advance real freedom. She has served the country honorably as Vice President and she is ready to be President,\" he wrote.\n\nSen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia\n\nThe senator from Georgia and pastor, 54, won two close races in the Peach State, cementing the Democratic majority in the Senate and becoming a darling of the party in the process.\n\nGov. Jared Polis of Colorado\n\nPolis, 49, has served as Colorado's governor since 2019 and is among the nation's most popular governors. He represented the state's 2nd District in Congress for a decade and also served on the Colorado Board of Education.\n\nHe took the helm of the National Governors Association in July.\n\nGov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina\n\nCooper has been North Carolina's governor since 2017 and is currently serving his second term. He practiced law for nearly two decades and was also in the state House and state Senate before he was elected attorney general in 2000. Cooper, 67, was North Carolina's chief law enforcement officer for four terms.\n\nCooper was campaigning with Harris over the weekend before Mr. Biden dropped out, and he threw his support behind Harris on Sunday night.\n\n\"Kamala Harris should be the next President,\" Cooper posted on social media. \"I've known @VP going back to our days as AGs, and she has what it takes to defeat Donald Trump and lead our country thoughtfully and with integrity. I look forward to campaigning for her as we work to win NC up and down the ticket.\"\n\nHoward Dean, former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, told CNN that he could see Cooper as a running mate for Harris if she becomes the party's presidential nominee. Such a pairing could help Democrats win the Tar Heel state in November, he predicted.\n\n\u2013Robert Costa, Ed O'Keefe and Margaret Brennan contributed reporting.",

        "text": "Elections and the markets: 4 lessons from the past\nThe U.S. political landscape has taken several twists this summer, which likely won\u2019t be the last before the November election. Given the country\u2019s highly polarized political environment and the disparate policy principles, many investors may wonder whether the election\u2019s outcome will affect financial markets \u2014 and whether they should alter their investment strategy accordingly.\n\nThe good news is that while this election may feel different \u2014 they all do at some point \u2014 it\u2019s hard to find evidence that politics is a long-term determinant of market performance. This has held true over the long term as well as over past eight years.\n\nHere are four lessons we can draw from history:\n\n1. Markets don\u2019t favor a party.\n\nDespite the temptation to tie market outcomes to election results, stocks have performed well under both Republican (R) and Democratic (D) presidents. The strongest returns occurred during the F. Roosevelt (D), Clinton (D), Eisenhower (R) and Reagan (R) presidencies.\n\nSince 1930, there have been 23 U.S. presidential elections, with Democratic candidates winning 13 times and Republicans prevailing the remaining 10. The average annualized price return (excluding dividends) of the S&P 500 was 9.6% when a Democrat won and 5.7% when a Republican won. But when looking at longer-term horizons, such as 10 years post-election, results for both parties are similar, with the S&P 500 returning around 7%.1\n\nThe same pattern is observed over the past two administrations. Despite the sizable chasm between Joe Biden\u2019s and Donald Trump\u2019s policies and both experiencing equity bear markets (one caused by the pandemic during the Trump presidency and the other by aggressive Fed tightening during the Biden presidency), stock market returns have been nearly identical. The S&P 500 has returned 14% per year after dividends under each president, highlighting that markets are neither biased toward one party nor exclusively driven by election outcomes.1",

But no serious contender has mounted a challenge against Ms Harris.\n\nSomething strengthening the VP's hand is the fact that a number of Mr Biden's rumoured replacements have rallied behind her. They include Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, California Governor Gavin Newsom, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro.\n\nMs Harris could either be confirmed by a procedural vote at the convention or in a virtual \"roll call\" run by the party ahead of the gathering. The Associated Press has reported that this could happen 12 days before the convention.\n\nOr, in the increasingly unlikely event that the Democratic Party does not unite behind a single candidate, we could see an open convention for the first time in decades. Delegates would be free to decide who to vote for among multiple candidates.\n\nCandidates would need signatures from at least 300 delegates - no more than 50 coming from one state - for their name to appear on the ballot.\n\nThere would be an initial round of voting among the 3,900 pledged delegates, which includes voters deemed loyal to the Democratic Party.\n\nIf no candidate received a majority of votes after this first round, then more rounds of voting would take place. These rounds would include superdelegates, party leaders and elected officials, who would all cast ballots until a nominee is chosen.",

        "text": "Joe Biden, Public Opinion and His Withdrawal From the 2024 Race\nJoe Biden, Public Opinion and His Withdrawal From the 2024 Race\n\nJoe Biden\u2019s extraordinary decision to not pursue the Democratic nomination for president has upended the 2024 presidential race, with Vice President Kamala Harris emerging as a strong favorite for the Democratic nomination.\n\nHere are some of the key public opinion dynamics around Biden\u2019s choice.\n\nJob approval\n\nBiden\u2019s job approval ratings have been more negative than positive since late 2021. And only about a third of Americans have approved of his performance for the last year.\n\nBut Biden\u2019s approval rating was far higher in the early months of his presidency.\n\nAt about the 100-day mark of his presidency, Biden\u2019s 59% job rating was on par with approval of several recent presidents. It was 20 percentage points higher than Donald Trump\u2019s at a similar point in his presidency.\n\nThe early days of Biden\u2019s presidency featured some notable successes, including the manufacture and rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine (which began development under the Trump administration) and passage of a $2 trillion coronavirus economic aid package.\n\nHowever, the chaotic U.S. military withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021 proved to be a pivotal moment in Biden\u2019s first year \u2013 and, ultimately, in his presidency.\n\nOnly about a quarter of Americans (26%) \u2013 including fewer than half of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents \u2013 said the administration had done an excellent or good job of handling the situation.\n\nThis period also saw a new variant, and related surge, of COVID-19 \u2013 delaying the expected \u201creturn to normal\u201d following the vaccine rollout earlier in the year.\n\nBiden\u2019s overall job approval declined 11 points, from 55% to 44%, between July and September 2021. It has never been in positive territory since then.\n\nConfidence in Biden\u2019s handling of issues largely followed this same trajectory.\n\nAge and fitness\n\nConcerns about Biden\u2019s age and fitness to serve have been present since he ran for president in 2020.\n\nIn August 2020, Pew Research Center asked registered voters in an open-ended question if they had any potential concerns about the candidate they supported. Nearly a third of Biden supporters named his age or health.\n\nIn the weeks before the 2020 election, Biden was seen by more Americans as honest or compassionate than Trump was, and a larger share described him as a good role model. But Trump had a slight advantage when it came to being \u201cmentally sharp.\u201d\n\nWhile perceptions of some of Biden\u2019s personal traits and characteristics have changed little in the past four years, that\u2019s not the case for his mental acuity: The share of voters who view Biden as mentally sharp declined steadily over the course of his presidency.\n\nIn March 2021, 53% of voters said that \u201cmentally sharp\u201d described Biden very or fairly well. That dropped 20 percentage points over the next two years, to 33% in April 2023.\n\nIt fell another 9 points, to 24%, following his performance in the June 27 debate.\n\nThis pattern is evident in perceptions of Biden\u2019s other personal traits associated with his age, such as whether he is energetic. In January, only 24% of Americans described Biden as energetic, a 16-point drop from 2020.\n\nBiden\u2019s support has long been more about who he isn\u2019t than who he is\n\nBiden trailed Trump in many national surveys in the final weeks of his 2024 campaign. Those margins, including 4 percentage points in our most recent national survey, may not have boded well for the Democrat \u2013 though candidates have overcome larger deficits at this point in the race.\n\nBut among Biden\u2019s own supporters, there were widespread concerns about his age and health \u2013 and his ability to beat Trump.\n\nFrom the outset of his 2020 campaign, much of Biden\u2019s support has been defined not by who Biden is but by who he is not. In 2020, asked in an open-ended question why they supported Biden, a majority of his supporters said simply: \u201cHe is not Trump.\u201d\n\nHeading into the general election this year, the 2024 election was shaping up to be a record battle not just because of the age of the two candidates, but because of the historic size of the share of Americans who didn\u2019t like either one of them. A quarter of Americans fell into this group of so-called \u201cdouble negatives.\u201d\n\nAs of April, nearly half of registered voters (49%) said they wanted to see both candidates replaced on the ballot \u2013 and Biden supporters (62%) were considerably more likely than Trump supporters to say this.\n\nFollowing Biden\u2019s poor showing in the June 27 debate, his own supporters\u2019 calls for him to be replaced only increased. By early July, 71% of voters who backed Biden also said they would prefer to see both candidates replaced on the ballot.\n\nHow we did this This Pew Research Center analysis focuses on public opinion of Joe Biden as context for his decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential election. Most of the public opinion data in this analysis comes from Pew Research Center surveys over the course of Biden\u2019s presidency and has been featured in recent Center reports. Links to these reports, including details about the survey methodology, are available in the text. The first chart on presidential approval includes data from the Gallup organization on Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush\u2019s presidential approval ratings.\n\nPhoto: President Joe Biden talks to reporters outside the White House before boarding Marine One in January 2023. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)",

        "text": "Who is running for president in 2024? A look at the candidates still in the race\nThe 2024 presidential election took a turn on Sunday after President Joe Biden withdrew from the race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as his potential successor atop the ticket for the Democratic Party.\n\nBiden, 81, who faced increased pressure to leave the race after he appeared disoriented at a televised debate with Trump last month, passed the torch to Harris, who soon announced her bid for the party's nomination. Behind the scenes, the Biden campaign machine switched gears to benefit the vice president.\n\nHarris is expected to be in Delaware Monday, according to U.S. Sen. Tom Carper. Harris is expected to arrive in New Castle County Monday afternoon, where she will meet with members of the Delaware delegation and go to Biden's campaign headquarters in Wilmington, which is expected to transition to hers as she mounts her presidential campaign.\n\nHere's what to know about who is running for president in the 2024 election.\n\nDonald Trump\n\nFormer President Donald Trump formally accepted the Republican Party's nomination on the final day of the Republican National Convention last Thursday in Milwaukee.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nTrump, in his first public remarks since narrowly escaping a would-be assassin's bullet, described in a hushed and somber voice being hit in the ear, ducking for cover, finding his hand drenched with blood and then raising his fist in the air \u2212 an effort, he said, to reassure the supporters at the Pennsylvania rally that he was alright.\n\n\"I stand before you in this arena only by the grace of almighty God,\" he told the crowd at the Republican National Convention, calling for national unity.\n\nKamala Harris\n\nHarris is now the presumptive favorite to earn the Democratic Party's nomination for president at the Democratic National Convention next month in Chicago.\n\nOn Sunday, after Biden called to tell her he was ending his reelection campaign, Harris whipped up a statement and placed calls to lawmakers, governors, civil rights leaders and union bosses, thanking them for their endorsements and telling them how she planned to earn the presidential nomination.\n\nHarris would ultimately make more than 100 calls over the next 10 hours, speaking to Biden multiple times as she took the reins of the flailing 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nInside KamalaHQ:How Harris quickly began plotting campaign after Biden's shocking exit\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. is an independent candidate for president.\n\nKennedy held a news conference in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts after Biden announced he was withdrawing from the race Sunday afternoon.\n\n\"I'm the only candidate who can beat President Trump,\" Kennedy said on X Sunday.\n\nMarianne Williamson\n\nMarianne Williamson is a candidate for the Democratic nomination for the 2024 presidential election.\n\nWilliamson's website says she is a \"bestselling author, political activist and spiritual thought leader\" and has authored 16 books, four of which have been No. 1 New York Times bestsellers.\n\nIn a statement posted on social media Sunday, Williamson said she called for Biden to \"step down from his renomination bid the day after the Trump-Biden debate\" on June 27.\n\n\"There is nothing we have seen since that night that wasn\u2019t on full view in the debate. Effective crisis management would have called for all those who are calling for him to step down now, to do so immediately - when I did,\" the statement reads.\n\nJill Stein\n\nJill Stein announced in November 2023 that she would be seeking the Green Party's nomination in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nStein, 74, is a physician and environmental activist who previously ran for president in 2012 and 2016. In a video announcing her campaign, Stein said she wants to offer voters a choice \"outside of the failed two-party system.\"\n\nCornel West\n\nCornel West launched his bid for the White House in June 2023 under the People's Party, but has since announced he is running as an independent.\n\nWest, 71, is a longtime philosopher, activist and author who has served as a professor at Harvard University, Yale University and other institutions.\n\nChase Oliver\n\nChase Oliver, a Libertarian, won his party's nomination in May.\n\nThe 38-year-old describes himself as \"armed and gay\" and previously ran for the Senate in Georgia in 2022, receiving about 2% of the vote.\n\nContributing: USA TODAY staff\n\nGabe Hauari is a national trending news reporter at USA TODAY.

        "text": "US Elections 2024 Live Updates: Kamala Harris' candidacy all but assured after Schumer, Jeffrie's endorsement\n00:30 (IST) Jul 22\n\nUS President Joe Biden on Sunday ended his reelection campaign. He said in a letter posted on X that he would remain in office until the end of his term and address the country later this week on his decision.\n\n\n\nBelow are reactions from politicians and advocacy groups:\n\n\n\nFormer President Donald Trump\n\n\n\nIn a phone call with CNN minutes after Biden announced his exit from the 2024 race, former President Trump responded, \u201cHe is the worst president in the history of our country. He goes down as the single worst president by far in the history of our country.\u201d Trump also said he thought Vice President Kamala Harris will be easier to defeat than Biden would have been, according to CNN.\n\n\n\nChuck Schumer, senate majority leader\n\n\n\n\"Joe Biden has not only been a great president and a great legislative leader but he is a truly amazing human being. His decision of course was not easy, but he once again put his country, his party, and our future first. Joe, today shows you are a true patriot and great American,\" the Democrat said in a statement.\n\n\n\nElise Stefanik, House Republican conference chairwoman\n\n\n\n\"If Joe Biden can\u2019t run for re-election, he is unable and unfit to serve as President of the United States. He must immediately resign,\" Stefanik said in a statement.\n\n\n\nGavin Newsom, Governor of California\n\n\n\n\"President Biden has been an extraordinary, history-making president \u2014 a leader who has fought hard for working people and delivered astonishing results for all Americans. He will go down in history as one of the most impactful and selfless presidents,\" Newsom posted on X.\n\n\n\nDonald Trump Jr\n\n\n\n\"Kamala Harris owns the entire leftwing policy record of Joe Biden. The only difference is that she is even more liberal and less competent than Joe, which is really saying something. She was put in charge of the border and we saw the worst invasion of illegals in our history!!!\" Donald Jr said on X.\n\n\n\nErich Pica, President of Friends of the Earth Action\n\n\n\n\"We thank President Biden for his decades of leadership and support the decision to end his re-election campaign. While far from perfect, Biden has taken some historic steps to address the climate crisis by passing the Inflation Reduction Act and kickstarting major investments in renewable energy.\n\n\n\n\"What\u2019s at stake in this election remains the same: Trump is an existential threat to our democracy and the planet and would guarantee a full descent into climate chaos,\" Pica said in a statement.\n\n\n\nGretchen Whitmer, Governor of Michigan\n\n\n\n\"President Biden is a great public servant who knows better than anyone what it takes to defeat Donald Trump. His remarkable work to lower prescription drug costs, fix the damn roads, bring supply chains home, address climate change, and ensure America\u2019s global leadership over decades will go down in history. My job in this election will remain the same: doing everything I can to elect Democrats and stop Donald Trump, a convicted felon whose agenda of raising families' costs, banning abortion nationwide, and abusing the power of the White House to settle his own scores is completely wrong for Michigan,\" Whitmer said on X.\n\n",

        "text": "Who is Kamala Harris and will she be the first woman US president?\nJoe Biden's chosen successor has had a sometimes rocky path to power, and a campaign against Donald Trump will test her like never before.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhen Joe Biden dropped out of the US presidential election after weeks of pressure from his party, he quickly made clear he had only one successor in mind.\n\n\"My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President,\" he wrote in a post on X.\n\n\"And it\u2019s been the best decision I\u2019ve made. Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats \u2014 it\u2019s time to come together and beat Trump. Let\u2019s do this.\"\n\nIn her own statement, Harris wrote: \"On behalf of the American people, I thank Joe Biden for his extraordinary leadership as president of the United States and for his decades of service to our country.\n\n\"I am honoured to have the president\u2019s endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination.\"\n\nHarris still has to be formally nominated by the party at its convention in Chicago in a few weeks' time, and it is not yet known if she will face a challenger.\n\nBut the combination of her current position, Biden's support and the collective exhaustion from the effort to get him to stand down will make it difficult for other candidates to explain why she should have to fight for the nomination \u2014 especially since, if elected, she would be the nation's first woman president and only its second black president.\n\nSo how did Harris get to the brink of the presidency?\n\nKamala Harris, the would-be 47th president of the US. Joe Lamberti/Copyright 2024 The AP. All rights reserved\n\nThe daughter of a Jamaican-American father and a Tamil Indian mother, the 59-year-old Harris grew up in Oakland, California. After graduating from university and law school, she became a district attorney, working her way up in California's legal system before being elected the state's attorney general in 2010.\n\nRe-elected in 2014, she was then elected to the US Senate in 2016, replacing outgoing Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer. Once in the Senate, Harris quickly became nationally renowned for bringing her prosecutorial skills to bear in committee hearings, subjecting heavily briefed and experienced witnesses to forensic questioning that several times made news in its own right.\n\nAmong these were Trump's only two confirmed attorneys general, Jeff Sessions and Bill Barr, and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nThe Kavanaugh confirmation process in 2018, which ultimately saw the judge confirmed to the US' highest court, is now most remembered for serious allegations of sexual assault levelled publicly against him by women who had known him in high school and college.\n\nHowever, before the allegations were made and then discussed in the Senate, Harris had already used the hearings to exert pressure on Kavanaugh over his restrictive views on abortion, memorably asking him if he could think of \"any laws that give government the power to make decisions about the male body?\"\n\nNot long after the Kavanaugh hearings, Harris announced she was running for the Democratic presidential nomination \u2014 a campaign that would pit her against Biden.\n\n'That little girl was me'\n\nHaving built a powerful national brand in a relatively short span of time, Harris launched her presidential campaign in January 2019. Her first campaign rally drew 20,000 supporters, and her first-day fundraising figures indicated she was a force to be reckoned with.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHowever, the Democratic field soon ballooned to more than 20 candidates, and setting herself apart on policy became hard for Harris, especially against bold left-wingers Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.\n\nHer most memorable moment, ironically, came when she confronted Biden during a TV debate about his opposition to the \"bussing\" policies implemented to aid school desegregation after the passage of the Civil Rights Act. Calling him out for his \"civil\" relationship with segregationist senators in the early 1970s, she reminded Biden of the impact desegregation had.\n\n\u201cAnd you know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bussed to school every day. And that little girl was me.\u201d\n\nThe exchange turned out to be the high point of Harris' campaign. Come the third quarter of 2019, it was clear that her campaign was internally disorganised, had a high staff turnover, and was struggling to raise money. Even as the Democratic field began to shrink and consolidate around the early frontrunners, her polling numbers did not rise, and she dropped out before the first primaries.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThen, in the summer of 2020, Biden chose her as his running mate, describing her as \"a fearless fighter for the little guy and one of the country\u2019s finest public servants.\"\n\nThe constraints of the COVID-19 pandemic notwithstanding, she proved to be a strong campaigner in the 2020 race, delivering an effective debate performance against Trump's Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nWhen she and Biden won the election, Harris became the first woman, the first black person and the first person of South Asian background to serve as US vice president in one stroke.\n\nHarris' time as vice president, however, would prove to be difficult.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTough at the top\n\nThe Biden administration began in the shadow of the 6 January 2021 attack on the US Capitol, and with the pandemic still killing Americans in their thousands while the economy struggled to cope.\n\nIn this context, Biden assigned Harris a portfolio of towering issues, among them immigration and voting rights \u2014 deeply divisive questions that could only be tackled via major legislation, something that in turn demanded the support of a Senate supermajority that the Democrats did not command.\n\nHarris thus found herself trying to make the case for sweeping reforms that never stood much chance of success on Capitol Hill. Her effort to tackle the US' decades-old immigration problems was not helped by an infamous interview in which she visibly bristled when asked why she had not yet visited the US-Mexico border.\n\nThere was also a steady stream of negative stories about the atmosphere in Harris' office, which saw strikingly high staff turnover in the administration's early years, and outsiders speculated unflatteringly about just how meaningful her role actually was.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHowever, as Biden's re-election campaign kicked into gear, Harris once again began appearing on the campaign trail, where she has once again proven she is able to draw and enthuse a crowd even as the ageing president increasingly struggled.\n\nWhen it became clear that the party was turning against the prospect of Biden running again, speculation that she would be the natural successor immediately began to rise, leading to an explosion of memes riffing on her distinctive laugh and repeated invocation of one of her mother's favourite sayings: \"You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?\"\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Harris can improve upon Biden's anaemic poll numbers and flagging fundraising, and it is still unclear whether she will face a challenge for the nomination.\n\nHowever, the relief at Biden's withdrawal will send new energy and optimism through her party, at least in the short term \u2014 and the Trump campaign's well-honed attacks on the president's age are now suddenly moot.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMore embarrassingly for her rival, the electorate is already being reminded that before he entered politics himself, he personally donated to both her California campaigns.",

The threshold is 1,976 delegates, and NBC estimates that Harris has the spoken or written backing of 1,992 delegates.\n\nWhile not yet formally the party's presumptive nominee, Harris' position as frontrunner is rock solid, and no potential challengers have signaled they intend to vie for the nomination.\n\nIn the hours since President Joe Biden announced that he would end his teetering reelection campaign, Harris and the Democratic party have pulled in roughly $250 million in online donations and major donor commitments.\n\nThe Democratic fundraising platform ActBlue has processed $106 million in contributions to Democratic candidates since Biden dropped out, according to an automated tracker.\n\nIt is not clear yet how much of this money was given to House and Senate campaigns and how much went to the former Biden campaign, rebranded overnight as the Harris for President campaign.",

        "text": "Project 2025: What a second Trump term could mean for media and technology policies\nSections Print\n\nBack to top Introduction\n\nIn a 900-page volume titled Project 2025, a conservative movement of over 400 scholars led by the Heritage Foundation has outlined a comprehensive policy vision for what a conservative administration could implement upon taking office in January 2025. The writers and contributors make recommendations regarding foreign and domestic policy, education, and the economy to give the administration a running start into a short four-year term. Critics have called it a blueprint for autocratic takeover. This blog will look at a key aspect of Project 2025\u2019s blueprint: Its plans for technology, media, and communications policies and the potential implications on the future of existing public policies.\n\nBack to top Project 2025: A vision for conservative administrations\n\nBack to top The media as the \u201cenemy of the American people\u201d\n\nBack to top Project 2025\u2019s complaints about Big Tech and social media platforms\n\nBack to top The next frontier: Project 2025 on Artificial Intelligence\n\nOn the topic of artificial intelligence (AI), Project 2025 focuses on the adversarial relationship with China: The U.S., according to them, must subvert China\u2019s goal to become the global leader on AI.63 To do so, the government should invest in and protect American innovation64 while barring American companies from helping China achieve technological dominance.65 The authors also envision the use of AI to support a variety of processes, such as the detection and disruption of foreign interference on social media66 and the detection of Medicare and trade abuses.67 Project 2025\u2019s AI policy is neither clear nor comprehensive. OpenAI, the key player in the market currently under FTC investigation, finds no mention in the 920-page volume, neither do its competitors. Privacy and copyright concerns related to the vast amounts of training data required to build AI seem to be of little concern, and so are the risk of job loss related to AI, the potential harm of AI-generated misleading content such as deepfakes, or its impact on energy consumption and climate change. Biden\u2019s Executive Order on AI mandates principles such as standards for AI safety, protection of user privacy and civil rights, and promoting healthy competition and innovation. Trump has said he will reverse this Executive Order, claiming it is an example of government overreach. The AI industry is developing at a rapid pace: Comprehensive policy must be in place to protect individuals and societies, curtail abuses of power, and guide research in beneficial, safe directions.\n\nBack to top Project 2025 \u2013 or Agenda47?\n\nTrump continues to deny involvement in Project 2025 despite harboring close connections to its authors, praising it in the past, and even acknowledging in a speech in 2022 that the Heritage Foundation would write a detailed plan for the movement\u2019s next administration. And the plans laid out in Agenda47, Trump\u2019s own official policy agenda, closely echo those of Project 2025. In short videos on his campaign website former president Trump, though in much less detail than the 900-page volume, outlines his vision for a second term, which, on technology policy issues, includes investigations of Big Tech and the FBI for what he describes as an anti-American regime of censorship; intentions to block federal efforts to curb domestic mis- and disinformation, and the firing and investigating of employees engaged in this task in the Department of Justice, Homeland Security, or any other agency. He also plans to revise Section 230; limit social media\u2019s ability to both moderate content and ban individuals from their platforms; and bring both the FCC and the FTC under presidential authority. On technology and media policy, Project 2025 and Agenda47 have common themes: Plans to expand presidential power and limit departmental agency, accusations that technology companies and the government colluded in what they deem censorship, and restricting Chinese ownership and investments. Like the language used by the Heritage Foundation, Agenda47 ties Trump\u2019s technology and communication policy to conservative values and ideals, saying: \u201cThe fight for Free Speech [capitalization in original] is a matter of victory or death for America\u2014and for the survival of Western Civilization [capitalization in original] itself.\u201d And both plans fail to provide detailed visions for how to regulate AI. The policy agendas mirror each other closely, and both suggest a vision for technology and communication policy that is both repressive and lax.\n\nBack to top The ultimate vision: An end to perceived attacks on and censorship of conservatism\n\nThe policy agenda outlined in Project 2025 is seemingly motivated by a sense of discrimination against conservative ideology.68 The federal government, it says, has been \u201cweaponized against conservative values,\u201d69 putting \u201cliberty and freedom under siege.\u201d70 In response, the authors aim to weaken those institutions which they consider part of the attack. Their domestic enemies in technology and communication policy range from the mainstream media generally and public broadcasting specifically to Big Tech and includes the agencies which support and regulate them. If enacted, these policies could harm democracy by restricting press access to the administration and defunding those that report on them, create a mainstream internet landscape which mirrors unmoderated breeding grounds for extremism such as 4chan, and miss the opportunity to enact comprehensive and safe data protections and guardrails for AI.",

        "text": "Will Vice President Harris beat Trump? Historian who's predicted 9 of the last 10 elections weighs in\nPresident Joe Biden's withdrawal from the presidential race Sunday sent polling statistics and frontrunner theories back to square one.\n\nSo far this year, Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump had led President Biden in most polls, but after the Democrat dropped out of the race and backed Vice President Kamala Harris as the party's new candidate, it remained to be seen how the new nominee would fare.\n\nOn Tuesday, a Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Harris now leading Trump 44% to 42%. The two had been tied in the outlet's poll from the week prior, though that was before she officially entered the race.\n\nAnd as other polling statistics continue to trickle in, political strategists and American voters alike are trying to evaluate the new state of the 2024 presidential race.\n\nBut is it still too early to tell how it will all play out? Not if you ask Allan Lichtman.\n\nThe historian and 51-year American University professor is the creator of a presidential election prediction system called \"Keys to the White House,\" which uses 13 true-false criteria to forecast the winning candidate. It's helped Lichtman correctly predict 9 of the 10 most recent presidential elections.\n\nRELATED STORY | An election historian explains why Biden should stay in the race\n\nAfter President Biden's shaky debate performance last month and calls for him to drop out of the race amplified, Lichtman told Scripps News the Democrats' only chance of winning was if the commander-in-chief stayed in the running.\n\nBut on Tuesday, Lichtman told us that although the president stepping aside cost the party one of the \"keys\" \u2014 that being the incumbency key \u2014 he believes Democrats will \"avoid disaster\" by their coalescing around Harris as the likely nominee, thereby avoiding the loss of the contest key.\n\nLichtman said this now puts the Democrats down only three keys. They are party mandate \u2014 which he defines as the incumbent party holding more seats in the U.S. House of Representatives after midterm elections than before, which didn't happen \u2014 incumbency, and incumbent charisma, which Lichtman said was a loss \"because Harris is not an FDR.\"\n\nLichtman told Scripps News for the incumbent to be counted out of the race, they would need to be down six total keys \u2014 meaning three more would have to fall.\n\n\"That can happen, but it's not likely. So as a result of the Democrats retaining the contest key, I continue to say, a lot would have to go wrong for the Democrats to lose this election,\" Lichtman said.\n\nRELATED STORY | Kamala Harris secures enough delegates to clinch the Democratic nomination for president\n\nThe other keys a candidate can use to win in Lichtman's model include:\n\nwhether the incumbent sees a significant third-party candidate\n\nwhether the economy is in recession\n\nlong-term economic growth\n\nmajor policy change\n\nwhether there is sustained social unrest during the campaign cycle\n\nbeing untainted by scandal\n\nsuffering no foreign/military failure\n\nachieving foreign/military success\n\nwhether the challenging party's candidate is charismatic or a national hero\n\nBecause the keys largely depend on the incumbent's actions, Lichtman claims it's going to be a struggle for Trump to outpace Harris at any point. He says this is particularly apparent because she's retained much of President Biden's campaign team and structure \u2014 and his keys.\n\n\"Trump is in deep trouble. You don't change keys. He has no influence over the keys that decide an election,\" Lichtman said. \"She has all the trappings of a strong administration. All the money goes to her. The donors are rallying to her. The delegates are rallying, and the rank-and-file voters seem to be rallying. And Trump has to totally recalibrate his campaign. 'Dementia Joe' is not going to fly with vigorous Harris here.\"\n\nLichtman said his final prediction won't come until August, after the Democratic National Convention. In part, he said this is because he's waiting until then to decide on the social unrest key.",

        "text": "Can Kamala Harris Beat Trump? Here's What Polls Show\nThe Democratic Party appears to be injected with new energy following President Joe Biden\u2019s decision on Sunday to drop out from the race and endorse Kamala Harris. She raised a record-breaking $81 million within 24 hours of announcing her candidacy, and as of Monday night, Harris has secured enough support from delegates at the Democratic National Convention to clinch the Democratic nomination.\n\nBut even if Harris becomes the Democratic nominee at the convention in August, concerns remain about her ability to compete in a general election against former President Donald Trump.\n\nA slight majority of Americans have a negative opinion of Harris, according to FiveThirtyEight polling, citing polls conducted before Biden dropped out. Some 51% of Americans disapprove of Harris to 38% who approve. Trump has a higher disapproval rating at 53%, but 39% of Americans approve of him.\n\nAggregated election polls show Harris lagging behind the former President by a small, but not insurmountable margin of 1.5 percentage points on average, according to an analysis done by the Washington Post of 11 different pollsters. These figures are only a slight improvement on President Joe Biden, who trails Trump by 1.9 percentage points. However, all of these polls were conducted before Biden\u2019s drop-out announcement, and surveys about the potential performance of hypothetical candidates are often inaccurate.\n\nWith those caveats, here are what some of the most respected polls show:\n\nABC News/The Washington Post/Ipsos\n\nABC News, The Washington Post, and Ipsos conducted a poll from July 6 to July 9 interviewing 2,431 U.S. registered voters via phone. ABC News/The Washington Post polls are ranked second in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s list of best pollsters after the New York Times/Siena College, which has yet to release a national survey on a Harris vs. Trump matchup.\n\nTheir survey found that Harris outperformed Trump by 2 percentage points. That was slightly better than Biden, who in the same poll, performed exactly the same as Trump. However, this poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points, which means that Trump and Harris were neck and neck.\n\nThe Economist/YouGov\n\nIn a poll conducted by The Economist and YouGov from July 13 to July 16 that questioned 1,404 U.S. registered voters, Harris trailed behind Trump by 5 percentage points, performing worse than Biden, who trailed Trump by 2 percentage points. The margin of error on this poll was plus or minus 3 percentage points.\n\nReuters/Ipsos\n\nReuters and Ipsos conducted a poll on July 16 surveying 1,202 adults living in the U.S. in the aftermath of the assassination attempt on Trump. The survey found that the former U.S. President narrowly edged out Harris by 1 percentage point. The same poll showed Trump outperforming Biden by 3 percentage points. The margin of error on these questions was plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, meaning that Trump and Harris\u2014as well as Trump and Biden\u2014were neck and neck in this poll.\n\nYahoo! News/YouGov\n\nYahoo! News and YouGov conducted a poll from June 28 to July 1, after Biden\u2019s botched debate performance but before the assassination attempt on Trump. The poll showed Trump outperforming Harris by 2 percentage points, the same figure he outperformed Biden by.\n\nThe poll also found that while 38% of voters who lean Democrat preferred Harris as the replacement for Biden, 42% believed that someone else would be a better fit for the nomination. The survey polled 1,754 American adults.\n\nThe New York Times/Siena College\n\nThe New York Times/Siena College poll is considered the most accurate in the country, according to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s rankings. While they have yet to release a national survey on Harris vs. Trump, polls in the swing states of Pennsylvania and Virginia from July 9 to July 12 found that Trump led Harris by 2 percentage points in Pennsylvania, within the margin of error of 3.7. Harris outperformed Trump by 5 percentage points in Virginia, where the margin of error was 4.2.",

        "text": "Study: U.S. presidential elections can influence local prosecutor races\nNational politics don\u2019t stay in the federal arena. Instead, they are increasingly filtering down to local races \u2014 including the prosecutor\u2019s office.\n\nHaving the same political party alignment as a successful U.S. presidential candidate gives an incumbent prosecutor a significant edge in re-election, according to recent research by Binghamton University Political Science Professor Jeffrey L. Yates. Local prosecutors are important and powerful actors in the criminal justice system, he pointed out.\n\n\u201cThey have a lot of discretion and impact, especially since the vast majority of dispositions in the criminal justice system are negotiated pleas rather than trial outcomes,\u201d Yates said.\n\nCo-authored by Jamie L. Carson of the University of Georgia, Damon Cann of Utah State University and Ronald F. Wright of Wake Forest University, \u201cThe Increasing Nationalization of Local Elections: The Case of Prosecutors\u201d recently appeared in Political Research Quarterly. The researchers analyzed races from 2012 to 2020 in the nation\u2019s top 200 districts by population.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been interested in criminal justice policy and politics and noticed that there had been almost nothing written on prosecutor elections in political science. In fact, relatively little empirical work had been done on it in any field,\u201d Yates said.\n\nThat prompted a conversation with co-author Wright, who was the first to do empirical work on the topic. They began collecting data, which has led to a number of academic papers, Yates said.\n\nThe United States is the only country in the world in which local prosecutors are elected; 45 states elect their prosecutors, with Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, New Jersey and Rhode Island as the exceptions. However, the researchers noted that this wasn\u2019t always the case; the post was made by appointment until the mid-1800s.\n\n\u201cWhile people want prosecutors to have independence, they also want them to be accountable to the citizenry. The change in the 19th century from appointed to elected prosecutors was part of a broader change in approaches to government in which people wanted more control over government, fewer patronage appointments and more responsive officials,\u201d Yates explained.\n\nThrough the decades, American politics has undergone a steady shift that has narrowed the division between national and local politics, he observed. Tip O\u2019Neill, speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives from 1977 to 1987, popularized the phrase \u201call politics is local,\u201d although the phrase itself is believed to date back much earlier.\n\n\u201cLocal politicians can find themselves \u2014 and their campaigns \u2014 embroiled in national-level issues,\u201d Yates said.\n\nThe researchers found that incumbent prosecutors gain a meaningful advantage if they are the same party as the U.S. president, one that\u2019s not easy for challengers to overcome. Other influences were statistically significant, although smaller when compared to the presidential party boost: Higher crime rates tend to give an advantage to an incumbent, for example, and female incumbents are less likely to win, likely due to the influence of gender stereotypes.\n\nThe nationalization of local elections has a downside. Yates noted that local officials could end up running on issues they don\u2019t actually have the power to directly affect rather than those more pertinent to the local level.\n\nThe researchers are currently working on subsequent papers that take a deeper look into the subject, Yates said.\n\n\u201cWe hope to highlight the relevancy and importance of prosecutor elections,\u201d he added. \u201cThey are powerful officials, and these elections are becoming more salient and competitive.\u201d",

        "text": "Ballots to Bullion: Examining the US Election's Effect on Gold\nA brave new world Given the US's pivotal role in the global economy, coupled with the prevailing geopolitical uncertainties, the upcoming presidential election is viewed by many as a watershed moment with far-reaching implications. As it stands, Republicans led by Donald Trump are ahead in the polls, but the outcome is far from secured. Furthermore, the recent events in the campaign trail \u2013 both the assassination attempt on President Trump and President Biden stepping down from the presidential race \u2013 have increased the level of uncertainty for an already divided US electorate. In this context, investors are asking about the effect of the election on gold. Our analysis suggests that while US gold bar and coin demand seems to increase, on average, during Democratic presidencies, this is not the case with other segments of investment demand. In addition, party affiliation does not have a consistent impact on price during US elections. Instead, economic policies, both domestic and foreign, of any given president are more relevant to the behaviour of financial assets, including gold. And while, historically, the US election has not been seen as a geopolitical risk, both the world and the US electorate remain highly polarised. This in turn highlights the need for robust hedges in investor portfolios, a role that gold fulfils effectively.\n\nHighlights Elections have not, historically, had a significant or immediate effect on gold's performance but regardless of the winning candidate, near-term geopolitical risks remain high and may serve as a catalyst for gold.\n\nThe gold price typically responds to key drivers, such as the direction of the US dollar, interest rates or perceptions of risk, which can be, of course, influenced by economic, fiscal and monetary policies of a specific administration - irrespective of party affiliation.\n\nWhile our analysis is based on long-term historical precedent, the expectations about gold\u2019s performance can also be informed by its observed behaviour during the previous Trump administration and current Biden presidency, assuming a continuation of policies.\n\nChart 1: Polling data currently points to a Republican victory PredictIt polling data for the 2024 US presidential election* Chart 1: Polling data currently points to a Republican victory PredictIt polling data for the 2024 US presidential election* Chart 1: Polling data currently points to a Republican victory PredictIt polling data for the 2024 US presidential election* *As of 22 July 2024. Source: Bloomberg, PredictIt, World Gold Council Sources: Bloomberg, PredictIt, World Gold Council; Disclaimer *As of 22 July 2024.\n\nUS election impact on gold price performance Our analysis suggests that, historically, gold tends to perform below its long-term average in the period around the US presidential election (Chart 2). But this result has not been particularly consistent.1\n\nChart 2: Gold slightly underperforms around elections relative to long-term average Gold\u2019s average long-term performance compared to performance around presidential elections* Chart 2: Gold slightly underperforms around elections relative to long-term average Gold\u2019s average long-term performance compared to performance around presidential elections* Chart 2: Gold slightly underperforms around elections relative to long-term average Gold\u2019s average long-term performance compared to performance around presidential elections* * Time period assesses ranges from 1972-2022. Error bars represent two standard deviations. We note that a Republican win -6M prior displays the strongest return, however this is skewed by the 1972 and 1980 election. If those two data points are removed, the return would be the worst out of the seven scenarios shown above. Source: Bloomberg, World Gold Council Sources: Bloomberg, World Gold Council; Disclaimer * Time period assesses ranges from 1972-2022. Error bars represent two standard deviations. We note that a Republican win -6M prior displays the strongest return, however this is skewed by the 1972 and 1980 election. If those two data points are removed, the return would be the worst out of the seven scenarios shown above.\n\nThere are two opposite trends. Gold appears to do slightly better six months before a Republican president is elected and it remains flat in the period post-election. Conversely, gold tends to underperform before a Democratic president is elected and perform just below its long-term average in the six months post-election. However, none of these results are statistically significant. There are few observations for each of the cases analysed and there is significant variability within the results.2 This may suggest that gold is not responding to the party affiliation of an elected president but, more likely, to the expected effect of specific policies. This is also evidenced by the fact that gold does not consistently outperform during the full term of a president from one party over another. In addition, while our analysis shows that US demand for bars and coins notably increases during Democratic presidencies, this alone is not enough to solely dictate the direction of gold (see Appendix) especially since this result is not replicated in either US gold ETFs flows or positioning in COMEX futures. Overall, our analysis of gold and US presidential elections suggests that gold is not reacting directly to party affiliation or changes in leadership. Rather, it highlights the relevance of key global macroeconomic drivers of gold\u2019s performance in contrast to specific local dynamics.\n\nIs there a crystal ball this time? Notwithstanding gold\u2019s general behaviour during elections, this time we have the added advantage of knowing how gold performed during the previous Trump administration. Even though Biden is now not running for re-election, we can analyse the behaviour of gold under his presidency assuming there will be a continuation of his policies under a new Democratic administration. Gold did well during both Trump and (so far) Biden presidencies through a combination of policy decisions and broader global macroeconomic drivers. Gold rose by 60% during Trump\u2019s presidency - increasing by nearly 30% pre-COVID and slightly over 30% during the pandemic. Under Biden, gold moved sideways initially, but has gained more than 30% during the term so far, primarily due to broader macro factors and central bank buying.\n\nChart 3: COVID-19\u2019s impact on performance Indexed price performance of gold* Chart 3: COVID-19\u2019s impact on performance Indexed price performance of gold* Chart 3: COVID-19\u2019s impact on performance Indexed price performance of gold* *As of 28 June 2024. Source: Bloomberg, World Gold Council Sources: Bloomberg, World Gold Council; Disclaimer *As of 28 June 2024.\n\nUS elections and geopolitical risk Our analysis has previously shown a direct connection between geopolitical risk and gold. We have found that a 100bps rise in the Geopolitical Risk (GPR) Index,3 holding all else constant, has a c.2.5% positive impact on gold\u2019s return. This reinforces the view that gold tends to be perceived by investors as a safe haven during times of elevated geopolitical risk. But what does this mean in relation to a US presidential election? Our analysis yields that, historically, movements in GPR around past US elections have not proven to be a major direct driver of the gold price.4 Instead, we believe this form of risk shows up indirectly, and is subject to a time lag based on the market effect of the policies \u2013 both foreign and domestic \u2013 that a given administration rolls out throughout its term. Similarly, BlackRock\u2019s recent analysis on its internal geopolitical risk dashboard does not rank the upcoming US election as a top 10 geopolitical risk for 2024.5 Nevertheless, geopolitical risks remain high with little chance of a significant decline in the near future.\n\nChart 4: Elevated geopolitical risks likely to remain GPR Index over the past two presidencies* Chart 4: Elevated geopolitical risks likely to remain GPR Index over the past two presidencies* Chart 4: Elevated geopolitical risks likely to remain GPR Index over the past two presidencies* *As of 28 June 2024. Source: Matteo Iacoviello, World Gold Council Sources: Matteo Iacoviello, World Gold Council; Disclaimer *As of 28 June 2024.\n\nFor example, if Trump is elected, he will likely confront a more polarised world than during his previous term. As such, global markets may be more reactive to the direction of his policies \u2013 especially foreign ones. For instance, recent commentary from Trump on NATO may signal continued geopolitical uncertainty. Equally, from a GPR indicator standpoint, risk levels were significantly lower at the beginning of Biden\u2019s presidency, compared to where they are today; they will also likely continue to rise as the election nears regardless of the candidate behind which Democrats rally (Chart 5). And a Democratic presidency with similar policies to Biden's may meet a divided Congress and have difficulty in passing legislation.\n\nChart 5: 2020 is a poor proxy given countries were more focused on fighting the pandemic domestically Results from GRAM around the 2020 US Presidential Election* Chart 5: 2020 is a poor proxy given countries were more focused on fighting the pandemic domestically Results from GRAM around the 2020 US Presidential Election* Chart 5: 2020 is a poor proxy given countries were more focused on fighting the pandemic domestically Results from GRAM around the 2020 US Presidential Election* *Results shown here are based on analysis covering an estimation period from September 2020 to August 2021.

All such event risks could encourage investors to include more hedges, such as gold, in their portfolios and could provide support for gold. Our analysis suggests that the 2016 campaign serves as a suitable proxy for the upcoming election. For example, like 2016, we see a similarly divided electorate for both candidates and a potential shift in the party controlling the White House. Given Trump is currently leading in the polls we can develop a base-case expectation for likely government policy changes post-election (Chart 6). This also presents an opportunity for investors who may be underhedged and underexposed to assets like gold.\n\nChart 6: We view the 2016 election to be a stronger proxy for the upcoming election Results from GRAM around the 2016 US Presidential Election* Chart 6: We view the 2016 election to be a stronger proxy for the upcoming election Results from GRAM around the 2016 US Presidential Election* Chart 6: We view the 2016 election to be a stronger proxy for the upcoming election Results from GRAM around the 2016 US Presidential Election* * Our Gold Return Attribution Model (GRAM) is a multiple regression model of weekly gold price returns, which we group into four key thematic driver categories of gold\u2019s performance: economic expansion, risk & uncertainty, opportunity cost, and momentum.

Results shown here are based on analysis covering an estimation period from September 2016 to August 2017.\n\nTo conclude As we progress through the year the US presidential election will continue to dominate global news around the world.6 Unexpected events, as we have seen recently, have the capacity to rattle financial markets. In relation to the US presidential election\u2019s impact on the gold price, we found gold slightly underperforms around elections relative to its long-term average, albeit not statistically significant. During the six months following the Trump and Biden inaugurations gold returns were roughly -2.6% and -6.4%, respectively. Furthermore, we know that prior elections have not created an immediate impact to geopolitical risk, rather, they have contributed positively or negatively to the broader risk landscape on a lag as administrations roll out policies. And while gold has not reacted, on average, to the outcome of past elections, the outcome of this election may have a more noticeable effect on investor sentiment. A continuation of election-related uncertainty and rising geopolitical threats will add more volatility and likely impact broader macro variables. This, in turn, could drive investors to evaluate how they might mitigate risk in their own portfolios and draw them towards a safe-haven asset like gold.\n\nAppendix US bar and coin demand has doubled with Democrats As a key component of demand, retail bar and coin gold investment is a relevant segment to monitor leading up to the US election. Historical data suggests that the sale of gold coins via the US Mint tends to spike in anticipation of a Democratic victory. For reference, in any given month the average volume of ounces in gold coins sold to authorised purchasers via the US Mint is roughly 60,800 ounces.7 However, during the month of an election in which the Democrats win, this figure has risen on average to 86,400 ounces, compared with 71,000 ounces for Republican victories over the past 37 years. Anecdotal evidence indicates that retail bar and coin buyers may be Republican leaning. This could partially explain the increase in demand around the election, particularly when a Democrat wins. However, this pattern extends beyond the election month. Over the 12 months post a Democratic win, the average monthly volume sold is roughly 79,000 ounces compared to a mere 32,500 ounces observed after a Republican victory (Chart 7).\n\nChart 7: Gold coin mint sales are stronger with a Democrat in office Quarterly volume of Gold Eagle and Gold Buffalo bullion coins sold by the US Mint* Chart 7: Gold coin mint sales are stronger with a Democrat in office Quarterly volume of Gold Eagle and Gold Buffalo bullion coins sold by the US Mint* Chart 7: Gold coin mint sales are stronger with a Democrat in office Quarterly volume of Gold Eagle and Gold Buffalo bullion coins sold by the US Mint* *We acknowledge that Democratic victories have coincided with major economic or market events, and therefore disentangling the effect of a Democratic victory is not straightforward.

Data as of 28 June 2024.\n\nSimilarly, bar and coin demand (the volume of gold bars and coins bought by individuals) tends to surge and remain elevated when a Democrat is in the White House (Chart 8).\n\nChart 8: Physical demand stronger with a Democrat administration in the White House Quarterly US bar & coin demand in tonnes*\n\nWe found that average bar and coin demand during an election quarter equates to roughly 25t for Democratic victories, significantly higher than the 12t for Republican wins over the same period. Looking over the next four quarters, we find that demand when a Democrat has control of the White House averages roughly 26t, compared to just 7t under a Republican administration. These findings suggest that physical gold demand, whether motivated by demographics, political affiliation, or broader economic concerns, tends to increase under a Democratic administration.8 It is important to note, however, that these results do not hold for US gold ETF demand or COMEX futures positioning, nor are their effects - just like we see in the analysis of the gold price - either more short-term or more dependent on macro variables.",

        "text": "Kamala Harris wins enough support to clinch Democratic nomination\nKamala Harris wins enough support to clinch Democratic nomination\n\nKamala Harris: From prosecutor to possible president... in 100 seconds\n\nVice-President Kamala Harris has secured the support of a majority of Democratic delegates to become the party's nominee for president. A survey by the Associated Press on Monday evening said she had received the endorsement of more than the 1,976 delegates needed to win the nomination in the first round of voting. That means Ms Harris is on course to be crowned the party's standard bearer and take on Republican Donald Trump in November's presidential election. It becomes official when party delegates hold a roll call vote ahead of next month's Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago. Delegates are people who are selected to represent their electoral area. Their pledges of support are non-binding until the vote but unlikely to change. No-one has publicly stepped forward to challenge Ms Harris since President Joe Biden left the race on Sunday. He found himself under mounting pressure from senior members of his party following his stumbling debate performance against Trump. If the total holds between now and when delegates cast their votes, scheduled to take place from 1-7 August, Ms Harris would formally clinch the party's nomination.\n\nThe survey by AP is an indication of the groundswell of support for Ms Harris after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race on Sunday. Since Mr Biden's announcement, millions of dollars in donations have poured into her campaign and leading Democrats have lined up to support her bid as the Democratic nominee. Has Harris got what it takes to beats Trump? Harris donations top $100m after Biden exit Ms Harris is due to appear in the key swing state of Wisconsin on Tuesday, at a rally in Milwaukee that marks her first campaign event since Mr Biden made his decision and said he was endorsing his deputy. Meanwhile, Mr Biden will return to the White House after spending a period of time in isolation with a Covid-19 infection. He is due to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this week, during the other leader's visit to Washington. Ms Harris will meet Mr Netanyahu separately, but an aide of the vice-president told the BBC that a previously-scheduled event meant she would be unable to preside over a planned address by Mr Netanyahu to a joint session of Congress.\n\nKamala Harris: 'I know Donald Trump's type'\n\nSpeaking to staff at her campaign's headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, on Monday evening, Ms Harris had Trump in her sights. Referring to her early career as a prosecutor in California who took on predators and fraudsters, she added: \"I know Donald Trump's type.\" She said the Biden-Harris campaign had always been about two different versions of the future of the country - theirs and Trump's. \"One focuses on the future, the other focuses on the past,\" she said. \"Donald Trump wants to take our country backwards... we believe in a brighter future that makes room for all Americans.\" She also noted Mr Biden's accomplishments, saying her time serving as his vice-president was \"one of the greatest honours of my life\".\n\nBefore Ms Harris took to the stage, Mr Biden made his first comments since dropping out of the 2024 election via phone call while isolating after contracting Covid-19. He thanked aides and told them to \"embrace\" Ms Harris because \"she's the best\". \"I know yesterday's news was surprising and hard for you to hear, but it was the right thing to do,\" Mr Biden told them. He vowed to remain fully engaged in the campaign because democracy was at stake. Meanwhile Trump's new running mate, Senator JD Vance, attacked both Ms Harris and Mr Biden while campaigning in Virginia. \u201cHistory will remember Joe Biden as not just a quitter, which he is, but as one of the worst presidents in the history of the United States of America,\u201d he said. \u201cBut my friends, Kamala Harris is a million times worse and everybody knows it. She signed up for every single one of Joe Biden\u2019s failures, and she lied about his mental capacity to serve as president.\u201d\n\nBiden says leaving 2024 race was 'right thing to do'",

        "text": "Joe Biden gives Oval Office address on his withdrawal from 2024 US presidential election\nJoe Biden says he believes he's earned a second term as US president, but \"personal ambition\" cannot get in the way of saving democracy.\n\nIn a prime-time Oval Office address to explain why he abandoned his bid for re-election, the president declared the \"defence of democracy\" was at stake and was \"more important than any title\".\n\n\"In recent weeks, it's become clear to me I need to unite my party in this critical endeavour,\" Mr Biden said in the 11-minute speech.\n\n\"I believe my record as president, my leadership in the world, my vision for America's future all merit a second term, but nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy. That includes personal ambition.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"So I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That's the best way to unite our nation.\n\n\"There is a time and a place for long years of experience in public life. There's also a time and a place for new voices, fresh voices and, yes, younger voices. And that time and place is now.\"\n\nThe Oval Office address marked Mr Biden's first extensive public comments since posting an open letter on social media announcing his decision on Sunday.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"I've given my heart and my soul to our nation, like so many others,\" he said.\n\n\"And I'm blessed a million times in return with the love and support of the American people. I hope you have some idea how grateful I am to all of you.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule. The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America, lies in your hands.\"\n\nLive Moment Joe Biden has delivered remarks from the Oval Office, telling Americans \"now is the time for fresh voices\" and urging them to unite ahead of the November election. 'The power is in your hands' In his final remarks, the president tells Americans, it's up to them. \"History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America, lies in your hands. You just have to keep faith. Keep the faith. \"And remember who we are, we are the United States of America. And there are simply nothing, nothing beyond our capacity. We do it together. So let's act together.\"\n\nBiden says it has been 'the privilege of my life' to serve The president says he has given his heart and soul to the United States. \"My fellow Americans, it has been the privilege of my life to serve this nation for over 50 years. \"Nowhere else on earth could a kid with a stutter from modest beginnings in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Claymont, Delaware, one day sit behind the resolute desk in the Oval Office as president United States. But here I am.\"\n\nJoe Biden thanks Kamala Harris In closing, Joe Biden thanks his vice-president, Kamala Harris, who he describes as \"experienced, tough, capable\", and an \"incredible partner to me and a leader for our country\". \"Now the choice is up to you, the American people. \"When you make that choice, remember the words of Benjamin Franklin's, hanging on my wall here in the Oval Office \u2026 republic \u2014 if you can keep it. Whether we keep our republic is now in your hands.\"\n\nShow more\n\nMr Biden was in isolation with COVID when he announced his decision via the X platform, writing: \"While it has been my intention to seek re-election, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as president for the remainder of my term.\"\n\nIt followed weeks of sustained pressure from a growing number of prominent Democrats who were concerned about his visible signs of aging, and his ability to compete with Republican nominee Donald Trump.\n\nWithin minutes of the president's address, the Trump campaign sent a fundraising email to potential donors, which said if Mr Biden \"had an ounce of humility, he'd understand he's unfit to serve\".\n\n\"But now Kamala Harris is poised to continue his path of destruction. Shadow billionaires just unfroze tens of millions of dollars to bankroll her campaign!\"\n\nAt an earlier campaign rally in North Carolina, Trump attacked his likely opponent as a \"radical left lunatic who will destroy our country if she ever gets the chance to get into office\".\n\n\"For three-and-a-half years, lyin' Kamala Harris has been the ultra-liberal driving force behind every single Biden catastrophe,\" he said.\n\nMr Biden endorsed Ms Harris half an hour after announcing he would not run for re-election, and she has since won the backing of most top Democrats, including those who had been seen as her potential rivals.\n\nOn Monday, she announced she had secured the votes of the necessary number of delegates to lock in the nomination.\n\nShe watched Mr Biden's address to the nation from Houston, Texas, where she had been briefed on recovery efforts following Hurricane Beryl, a White House official said.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, the vice-president made a pitch to thousands of Black women at an event in Indianapolis.\n\n\"Our nation, as it always has, is counting on you to energise, to organise and to mobilise,\" Ms Harris told the convention for a historically Black sorority group, Zeta Phi Beta.\n\nShe is yet to announce a vice-presidential running mate.",

She is California\u2019s first female and South Asian attorney general. In 2021, she became the first woman to become vice president, in addition to being the first Black or Asian American person in the position.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAnd, if she were to win the general election against former President Donald Trump, she would become the first woman president of the United States.\n\nHere are five things to know about Harris:\n\n\n\n1. She ran for president in 2020 but didn\u2019t get very far.\n\ntoggle caption Gabrielle Lurie/The San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images\n\nHarris announced in 2019 she would run for the White House, and while Harris notably pushed Biden on his previous record over desegregation and busing, that was the high point of her run. Most of her bid, in fact, was riddled with campaign hiccups and minimal momentum.\n\nShe was criticized for how she championed tough truancy policies when she was the attorney general for California, which some said perpetuated inequities in the criminal justice system and disproportionately affected families of color. Harris later said she regretted the \"unintended consequences\" that law had on families.\n\nMore broadly, Harris failed to distinguish her positions on key issues, in ways that her competitors, such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, were able to. In the months following, Harris failed to gain steam with limited funds and little excitement behind her campaign, and she dropped out by December 2019.\n\n2. She has a mixed legacy in criminal justice\n\ntoggle caption Ted Soqui/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nDuring her 2020 presidential bid, Harris ran to the left of Biden on several criminal justice issues, like ending solitary confinement and implementing a national standard on the use of deadly force.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut her \u201ctough on crime\u201d track record as a prosecutor, district attorney, and attorney general in California during the 1990s and 2000s is a clear reminder of her complicated and sometimes contradictory legacy on the criminal justice system.\n\nOn the one hand, she established a reentry program in the early 2000s that was seen as a form of restorative justice. She supported legislation that would expand voting rights to those serving felony sentences. She also opposed the death penalty \u2014 and stood by that when she did not seek the death penalty against a gang member who killed a police officer in 2004. But when the opportunity came to get rid of the death penalty in California, Harris appealed that ruling. Then, when California Gov. Gavin Newsom put a moratorium on the death penalty in 2019, Harris praised Newsom for the decision, and subsequently called for a federal moratorium on executions.\n\nIt took her years as San Francisco\u2019s district attorney to adopt a defendant\u2019s rights policy known as the Brady doctrine, even though her staff recommended the policy to her in 2005. As state attorney general, she rejected the use of advanced DNA testing in the case of a Black man who was \u2014 and still is \u2014 on death row for a notable murder case, though she has since said she felt \u201cawful\u201d about that decision. She also did not go after cases that involved killings by the police in San Francisco shortly after the 2014 killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., which brought on the ire of protesters in Oakland. The year after, she declined to support a bill that would have her office investigate officer-involved shootings, and she did not back statewide standards over body cameras worn by police officers.\n\n3. She is known for high-profile grillings early in the Trump administration\n\ntoggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIt was 2018. Harris was still a relative newcomer in the Senate. And yet, she made a splash when she grilled Brett Kavanaugh, Trump\u2019s then-nominee for the Supreme Court.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cCan you think of any laws that give government the power to make decisions about the male body?\u201d she asked Kavanaugh in a question pointedly about reproductive rights.\n\nAfter Kavanaugh struggled to give an answer, Harris repeated the question. Kavanaugh\u2019s final response: \u201cI'm not thinking of any right now, senator.\u201d\n\nThat was one of several viral moments of Harris as she went after officials and politicians tied to the Trump administration, including former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, former White House chief of staff John Kelly, and former Attorney General William Barr.\n\nWhile Trump called her \u201cnasty\u201d for how she questioned Kavanaugh, her line of questioning piqued Trump\u2019s interest when she was freshly nominated by Biden to be his running mate in 2020, showing him and Republicans she was capable of going after them.\n\n4. It took a while to find her footing as VP, but when she did, she focused on issues that are key to younger voters\n\ntoggle caption Sarah Silbiger/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nDespite Harris\u2019 underwhelming performance in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, Biden nominated her to be his running mate, making her the first Black woman and person of Indian descent to be nominated by a major party for national office. The announcement was celebrated by many in the party: She had been seen as a rising leader among Democrats, and capable of leading an increasingly diversifying party and country.\n\nBut things went off to a rocky start when she entered the White House. She misstepped in an interview with NBC\u2019s Lester Holt when answering why she had not yet visited the border at the time, had turnover in her staff, and had consistently low approval ratings early into her tenure as vice president.\n\nAlthough Harris was initially seen as uncomfortable in the role, she quickly grew into the job. Harris said the Supreme Court\u2019s overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022 galvanized her, and she rewrote an entire speech she was supposed to deliver at an event about maternal health that day. She became the primary messenger on abortion and reproductive rights. Additionally, she campaigned aggressively for gun safety, has tried to connect with more women and people of color during her tenure, and was praised by progressives for her forceful call for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n5. Her race and gender have made her subject to sexist and racist attacks\n\ntoggle caption Kamil Krzaczynski/AFP via Getty Images\n\nWhile many women in politics are often victims of sexist remarks and verbal abuse, a 2020 study tracking more than 300,000 instances of gendered abuse and disinformation against 13 women political candidates found that Harris was the target of such attacks 78% of the time.\n\nNina Jankowicz, who researches disinformation targeting women in politics and is the co-founder and CEO of the American Sunlight Project, said harmful narratives are \u201cpart of the criticism and abuse that women in public life frequently receive.\u201d\n\nThe attacks against Harris in particular have often come from many on the right, including Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance. Trump advanced a birtherism conspiracy theory about Harris that falsely stated she was not qualified to run as vice president back in 2020. Trump also called Harris \u201ccrazy,\u201d and often ridicules the way she laughs \u2014 yet another display of hyper-criticizing women\u2019s voices.\n\nAnd Jankowicz said that it\u2019s important to call out the sexist and racist online trolling against Harris that\u2019s only grown since Biden\u2019s announcement on Sunday.\n\n\u201cAnd I just think it's really important at this historic moment that we label these narratives and lies as what they are: an attempt to undermine Kamala Harris' public service and her record of public service because of her gender, her background and her skin color,\u201d she said.",

        "text": "Vatican responds to Biden's withdrawal from the US presidential race\nThe Vatican typically refrains from commenting on the political affairs of any specific country. However, Rome made a notable exception by publishing an editorial on July 23 in L\u2019Osservatore Romano about President Joe Biden's July 21 announcement to exit the presidential election race.\n\n\u201cThis is a \u2018noble decision,\u2019\u201d wrote Alessandro Gisotti, in the editorial for the Vatican\u2019s official newspaper. He further remarked that by doing so, the Democratic president is \u201cplacing the country\u2019s welfare above his personal interests.\u201d\n\nDecisions uninfluenced by electoral campaigns\n\n\u201cWithout the need to make decisions solely for the electoral campaign, it is hoped that the American president will launch new bold and creative initiatives to achieve the goals that will define his historical legacy, particularly in foreign policy, starting with ending the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East,\u201d the newspaper editorial continued.\n\n\u201cIn 1999, Nelson Mandela made a similar \u2014 and in some ways even more significant and evocative \u2014 decision by choosing not to run for a second presidential term and withdrawing from public life,\u201d commented Gisotti.\n\nA parallel with Benedict XVI\n\nIn his editorial, Gisotti also drew an unexpected parallel with Benedict XVI, who resigned in 2013. \u201cEvery time a prominent figure chooses to step back, it immediately garners the sympathy and esteem of the public,\u201d Gisotti wrote. \u201cWe witnessed this vividly on February 11, 2013, with Benedict XVI\u2019s historic resignation. We also see this \u2014 albeit in a different context \u2014 just as clearly in the past 24 hours.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. election is closely watched at the Vatican, where some officials express concern about the possibility of Republican candidate and former president Donald Trump returning to the White House. This concern was amplified by the strong relationship with Biden's administration, a practicing Catholic, which has been very positive since his election in 2020. The pope thus loses a trusted interlocutor for the future. The Vatican also benefits from strong American support for its humanitarian efforts in Ukraine.\n\nThe pope as a messenger\n\nIn some diplomatic circles, Pope Francis is seen as a conduit to convey messages to the Catholic Democratic president. This was evident in the early months of the Ukraine war when some governments feared that excessive American arms deliveries could escalate the conflict into a global war. More recently, this has also been the case concerning the Middle East crisis, where governments have asked the pope to support some of their requests to the American president.",

        "text": "Who is Kamala Harris and how might she fare against Trump?\nOnce in the Senate, Harris was appointed to the homeland security and intelligence committees and later the Senate Judiciary Committee, which gave her a platform to grill Trump\u2019s judicial nominees. Whether it be questioning then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on whether the government had ever made laws related to the male body, or the Mueller investigation\u2019s of the Trump campaign\u2019s collusion with Russia, Harris became known for using her prosecutorial experience to advance Democratic priorities.\n\nYet as much as some of her Senate performances became well-known among political pundits, her most well-known moment in the national spotlight was before being elected vice president. And it was at Biden\u2019s expense during her campaign to be the Democratic presidential nominee in 2020.\n\nShe had already caught the country\u2019s attention with a heavily publicised launch in Oakland, California \u2013 this was near where she was born, her parents had worked and she had worked as a district attorney. But at the first Democratic Party debate, Harris directly targeted the then-former vice president, criticising Biden for positive comments he had made about pro-segregation politicians with whom he had served in his 36 years in the US Senate.\n\nWhile Biden had long postured that his willingness to work with diverse politicians was a political and legislative strength, Harris countered that:\n\nYou also worked with them to oppose bussing. And, you know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bussed to school every day. And that little girl was me.\n\nAs compelling as her launch and debate performance was, Harris\u2019 2020 presidential campaign was widely reported to be beset with disorganisation and the absence of compelling policy proposals. Sliding polls and funding numbers led to her suspending her campaign months before the Iowa caucuses, and long before a single vote was cast in Democratic primaries.\n\nNonetheless, her viral debate performance established her as a formidable politician and debate opponent \u2013 such skills were particularly well-reviewed when she deployed them against then vice president Mike Pence in their 2020 debate.",

        "text": "Biden isn't the first president to drop a reelection bid\nIf 2024 has taught us anything, it's that no presidential election is ever the same. This year's contest featured the first major-party nomination of a former president \u2014 Donald Trump \u2014 since Democrats backed Grover Cleveland in the 1892 election. And this past weekend, President Joe Biden became the first presumptive nominee to abandon a reelection bid since the modern presidential primary process took shape in the 1970s.\n\nThese unfamiliar circumstances make it easy for observers to throw around the term \"unprecedented\" to describe what's happening, and in some respects, that word absolutely hits the mark. However, as is often the case, a longer view of American political history offers more commonalities with the current political situation than one might expect. Here then is a look at some of those past comparisons, many of which echo what we're seeing today.\n\nSeveral presidents didn't win (or seek) renomination\n\nBiden is the 13th president (of 46) to have served fewer than two terms as chief executive but not end up as his party's nominee in the ensuing presidential election.* That group consists of five presidents who won election to the White House (including Biden) and eight vice presidents who became president due to the death of their predecessor. Four of the vice presidents-turned-president did win a term in their own right but opted against seeking another four years after that. Overall, Biden is the fourth incumbent on this list to abandon some sort of reelection effort, while four others lost renomination at their party conventions, and the remaining five retired rather than run again.\n\nThe two most recent examples on this list involve incumbents who actively sought a second term before exiting the race following poor performances in early primaries. In 1968, Democratic President Lyndon Johnson had seemingly begun his reelection bid, but he surprised the country by announcing that he would not accept his party's nomination following a weak performance as a write-in candidate in the New Hampshire primary. (Behind the scenes, Johnson kept his options open about reentering the race, but that didn't pan out.) In 1952, Democratic President Harry Truman similarly announced that he wouldn't run again after losing the New Hampshire primary, although he received a handful of votes at the convention.\n\nOf course, contrary to his Democratic predecessors, Biden publicly sought renomination well beyond the spring (although both those races predate the modern primary process as we know it today). But similar to Johnson and Truman, Biden has faced low ratings for his job performance \u2014 his approval rating is only 38 percent in 538's tracker, while Johnson's stood in the mid-30s in March 1968 and Truman's the low 20s in March 1952. Interestingly, Johnson's approval rating rose sharply after his departure from the race, so we'll be watching to see if Biden gets any bump for abandoning his candidacy.\n\nThe last presidential dropout actually predates the modern two-party system. Like Johnson and Truman, Vice President John Tyler acceded to the presidency in 1841 after the president's death, in this case William Henry Harrison. Tyler had been elected as a Whig, but he was a former Democrat whose views stood sharply at odds with those of his adopted party, which quickly made him persona non grata. To retain any hope of winning the 1844 election without support from either major party, Tyler pressed the issue of annexing Texas to boost a third-party bid. But James Polk, running as the Democratic nominee, adopted much of Tyler's platform regarding Texas, which led Tyler to drop out and endorse Polk in August 1844. Polk went on to narrowly defeat Henry Clay, the Whig standard-bearer.\n\nTwo of the other vice presidents-turned-president in this table went out more on their own terms, winning and serving four more years but retiring as opposed to seeking another term. Theodore Roosevelt took office in 1901 following the assassination of Republican President William McKinley. He won a landslide victory in 1904, but said following his win that he wouldn't run in 1908 \u2014 a decision he later came to regret (Roosevelt famously ran again in 1912). Almost two decades later, Calvin Coolidge took over the White House in 1923 after Republican President Warren Harding's death and handily won the 1924 election. \"Silent Cal\" then told the press in 1927, in his famously laconic style, that \"I do not choose to run for president\" in 1928.\n\nNow, we have to go back quite a ways to find another elected president who was serving in their first term but didn't end up seeking their party's renomination at a major party convention. Nearly 150 years ago, Republican President Rutherford Hayes had made it clear that he would not seek a second term after winning the controversial 1876 election, so he didn't run in 1880. Prior to that, Democratic President James Buchanan didn't seek reelection in 1860 in the lead up to the Civil War, and Polk also retired ahead of the 1848 election. Unlike Biden, Hayes and Polk were both in their 50s at the end of their presidencies, but Buchanan was 69, about tied with Andrew Jackson as the oldest president to leave the office at that time. More broadly, exhaustion from difficult circumstances surrounding the Mexican-American War, the coming of the Civil War and a fraught contested election surely discouraged Polk, Buchanan and Hayes, respectively, from running again.\n\nThe four remaining presidents each lost out on their party's nomination at the convention after one term or less, indicative of how they struggled to garner and maintain intraparty support to a far worse extent than Biden did. Vice President Millard Fillmore acceded to the presidency after the death of President Zachary Taylor in 1850, but Fillmore lost out on the 1852 Whig Party nomination after 53 convention ballots. Democratic President Franklin Pierce easily won the 1852 election, but his actions amid growing sectional strife left him unpopular, so his party chose Buchanan over him at the 1856 convention.\n\nAs the Civil War ended, Vice President Andrew Johnson took over after the assassination of Republican President Abraham Lincoln, but he clashed with the GOP-led Congress \u2014 he'd been an anti-secession \"War Democrat\" who'd become Lincoln's running mate in 1864 \u2014 and went on to lose a bid for the Democratic nomination in 1868. In 1881, Vice President Chester Arthur succeeded the assassinated Republican President James Garfield, but Arthur fell short of the GOP nomination at the party's 1884 convention while battling kidney disease.\n\nBiden wasn't the first to face calls to step aside\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, Biden also isn't the first incumbent president who faced appeals from within his own party to abandon a reelection bid after clinching renomination in a party primary. In 1992, Republican President George H.W. Bush had turned back a primary challenge from his right flank by paleoconservative commentator Pat Buchanan and positioned himself as the GOP's presumptive nominee. But amid dissatisfaction with the economy, the mood for change seemed set against Bush. By late July, he'd fallen behind Democratic nominee Bill Clinton by double-digit margins after independent contender Ross Perot dropped out of the race.\n\nThat's when some Republican voices started calling for Bush to step aside and let someone else earn the nomination at the party's national convention in August. Editorials in notable outlets like The Orange County Register \u2014 paper of record in the long-time citadel of California Republicanism \u2014 asked Bush to \"stand down.\" GOP fundraiser Richard Viguerie, who helped develop direct mail political communication, went on CNN to call for Bush to \"follow the example\" of Truman and Johnson, which Viguerie said would \"preserve his place in history\" and \"do his party and his country a great service.\" (We heard similar statements from elected Democrats about Biden.) Beyond this, Vice President Dan Quayle also attracted similar calls, as his low approval prompted many Republicans to see him as a liability to the ticket: A former Florida state GOP chair even took out a full-page ad in The Washington Post that urged Quayle to quit the race.\n\nThe coverage of these pleas was significant enough to force a response. Although Bush ignored questions while out on the campaign trail, his campaign and allies pushed back on the idea that Bush would even consider stepping aside. Now, no members of Congress publicly called on Bush to leave the race \u2014 a major contrast to Biden \u2014 but New York Rep. Bill Green did tell reporters just two weeks before the GOP convention that Bush should replace Quayle with someone like Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (and later President George W. Bush's secretary of state).\n\nUnlike this year's push for Biden to leave the race, though, a concerted campaign to encourage Bush to drop out never took off, in part because pressure came predominantly from the party's right, which had never liked Bush much to begin with. That November, Bush ended up losing to Clinton, albeit by around 6 percentage points nationally instead of the double-digit poll margins released during the summer (in part because Perot reentered the race in the fall).\n\nThe party decides? The will of the voters? Or both?\n\nWith Biden's departure, Democrats are set to nominate a candidate who wasn't on the ballot in the presidential primary \u2014 a move by the party that some perceive as at odds with popular democracy. And not only did party leaders play a part in pushing Biden out, but they also quickly coalesced around Vice President Kamala Harris as the party's likely successor. There were likely few \"smoke-filled rooms\" this time around, given the public nature of Democrats' efforts to compel Biden's departure, and the relatively straightforward move to replace him with the sitting vice president. But American politics has a long history of party leaders putting their thumb on the scale to get their preferred choice.\n\nThe last time a party chose a standard-bearer who didn't really go before primary voters was in 1968. Vice President Hubert Humphrey announced his entry into the Democratic race in late April, about a month after the incumbent, Johnson, said he wouldn't run. Humphrey's main competitors, Sens. Robert F. Kennedy (Sr.) and Eugene McCarthy, slugged it out in the few major primaries at the time to prove their mettle to party leaders, but Humphrey captured much of their support as the establishment choice. Overall, Humphrey won just 2 percent of the primary vote \u2014 mostly as a write-in \u2014 but he easily captured a delegate majority on the convention's first ballot in an era when primaries didn't hold as much weight as they do today.\n\nYet that 1968 Democratic race precipitated reforms that brought about the modern primary system. Democrats wanted a more open and representative process that better reflected the desires of the party faithful, and their changes ahead of the 1972 election ended up having long-running ramifications for how both parties choose their nominees. Such an approach didn't necessarily have to involve more primaries \u2014 that actually wasn't the reformers' intention \u2014 but that was the result: A more voter-driven process that significantly, although not entirely, reduced the sway of party leaders.\n\nWith that in mind, some observers \u2014 including some Biden allies and many Republicans \u2014 have accused Democrats of ignoring the will of primary voters by encouraging Biden's departure. After all, Biden won about 87 percent of the vote across the 45 Democratic primary contests in 2024. That mark placed Biden in the vicinity of recent Democratic incumbents who went on to win reelection, like Bill Clinton in 1996 (88 percent) and Barack Obama in 2012 (91 percent).\n\nBut like most incumbents, Biden faced no meaningful opposition in the primary, making that contest's outcome a less useful indicator of what Democrats truly preferred. While Democrats had a positive view of Biden, their enthusiasm for him running again was never more than lukewarm. And after his woeful debate performance, many surveys found that a majority of Democrats wanted Biden to step aside. That might suggest that the party was responsive (if belatedly) to its voters' desires by encouraging Biden to leave the race \u2014 though it still doesn't guarantee that Harris would've won an open primary race.\n\nNevertheless, Biden's exit illustrates at least some remaining strength within the Democratic Party apparatus. Our current political era has been defined by weak parties that have struggled to organize and manage our politics even as strong partisanship has made things more polarized and tribal. Yet Democrats compelled Biden to leave the race, then rapidly rallied to Harris right after he stepped aside. This was a striking example of \"the party deciding,\" somewhat akin to 2020, when Democrats consolidated behind Biden ahead of Super Tuesday. In both cases, the desire to defeat Trump and the growing fear of nominating a candidate who might be unable to \u2014 Sen. Bernie Sanders in 2020, Biden in 2024 \u2014 prompted party leaders to act.\n\nFootnotes\n\n*The 22nd Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1951, restricts any person from being elected president more than twice and forbids any person who has acted as president for more than two years from seeking more than one additional term. However, incumbent President Harry Truman could have still run again in 1952 because the amendment did not apply to the current officeholder. George Washington set a precedent of serving no more than two terms, but there was no legal prohibition until this amendment, which was precipitated by President Franklin Roosevelt's four consecutive electoral victories.",

        "text": "Trump, Harris trade insults in newly energized US presidential campaign\nThe race for the U.S. presidency got a jolt of new energy Tuesday, with former President Donald Trump and his newly minted Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, showing no hesitation in disparaging each other as they hurtle toward the November poll.\n\nMeanwhile in Washington, President Joe Biden quietly returned to the White House, after his recovery from COVID-19, to heightened expectations that he\u2019d use his remaining time in office to achieve foreign policy goals.\n\nTrump shifted quickly to attacking Harris after Biden, 81, dropped his reelection bid on Sunday under pressure from Democratic colleagues concerned about his frailty, mental acuity and falling poll numbers.\n\n\"Lyin' Kamala Harris destroys everything she touches!\u201d Trump, 78, said on his Truth Social platform Tuesday. Earlier, he accused her of helping cover up Biden\u2019s condition.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats lied and misled the public about Crooked Joe Biden, and now we find he is a complete and total Cognitive and Physical \u2018MESS,\u2019\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey also mislead [sic] the Republican Party, causing it to waste a great deal of time and money\u201d on political advertising targeting a candidate, Biden, who is no longer Trump\u2019s opponent.\n\nHarris, a former courtroom prosecutor in California, the country\u2019s most populous state, told a rally Tuesday that she knew the likes of Trump.\n\nIn late May, Trump was convicted of 34 felonies linked to a 2016 hush money payment he made just ahead of the election he won eight years ago. The money was paid to an adult film star to silence her claim \u2013 denied by Trump \u2013 that she had a one-night tryst with him a decade earlier.\n\nBiden, who will finish the last six months of his term, wholeheartedly endorsed Harris, his second-in-command for the past 3\u00bd years.\n\nOn Monday, he told Harris campaign workers, \u201cThe name has changed at the top of the ticket, but the mission hasn\u2019t changed at all. And by the way, I\u2019m not going anywhere. I\u2019m going to be out there on the campaign with her, with Kamala.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been honored and humbled \u2014 I mean this from the bottom of my heart, my word as a Biden \u2014 for all you\u2019ve done for me and my family,\u201d he said, while adding that now, \u201cI\u2019m hoping you\u2019ll give every bit of your heart and soul that you gave to me to Kamala,\u201d he said.\n\nBiden said he would address the nation from the White House on Wednesday evening about his decision to withdraw from the presidential race and how he plans to govern during his remaining time in office. He is the first president since Lyndon Johnson in 1968 to withdraw from a reelection campaign.\n\nWhile some Democratic officials initially thought Biden\u2019s withdrawal might lead to a contested race among several contenders for the party\u2019s presidential nomination, the most likely presidential aspirants quickly supported Harris\u2019 candidacy.\n\nBy late Monday, Harris had amassed more than enough delegates to the party\u2019s national convention, to be held August 19-22 in Chicago, to unofficially claim the nomination, although the party is holding a virtual ballot that will decide the contest even earlier, by August 7.\n\nFormer House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, still an influential Democratic strategist, endorsed Harris, as did actor George Clooney, a major Democratic fundraiser in Hollywood who two weeks ago wrote an opinion article in The New York Times calling for Biden to end his candidacy, even though Clooney in June helped stage a glitzy fundraiser for him.\n\nThe top two Democratic congressional leaders, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, endorsed Harris on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cBoy, are we enthusiastic. It\u2019s a happy day. Democrats are moving forward more united than ever before\u201d to support Harris, Schumer said.\n\nThe Harris campaign said it had raised more than $100 million from Sunday afternoon, when Biden ended his candidacy, through Monday evening.\n\nMeanwhile, Harris is mulling whom to select as her running mate, with former Attorney General Eric Holder and Washington lawyer Dana Remus beginning to vet the backgrounds of several possible choices.\n\nAmong the names surfacing in news accounts were Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, a former U.S. astronaut; and six state governors, Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, J.B. Pritzker of Illinois, Tim Walz of Minnesota, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Roy Cooper of North Carolina.\n\nHarris headed Tuesday to Milwaukee, in the political battleground state of Wisconsin, for her first campaign rally as the likely Democratic nominee.\n\nTrump, after securing the Republican presidential nomination last week, is resuming his campaign on Wednesday with a rally in the city of Charlotte, North Carolina, another contested state. Trump won the state four years ago against Biden, even as he lost the national election.\n\nIn Washington, Secretary of State Antony Blinken extolled Harris for being \u201ca leading voice for American foreign policy and for our diplomacy.\u201d\n\nBut he emphasized that Biden has a lot of work ahead of him even as Harris campaigns to take the reins.\n\n\u201cWhat he\u2019s intensely focused on is the work that remains over these next six months to continue the efforts, the work that we\u2019ve been doing, particularly trying to bring peace to the Middle East, ending the war in Gaza, putting that region on a better trajectory; continuing to deal as effectively as he has been with the ongoing aggression by Russia against Ukraine and making sure we continue to do everything we can to strengthen Ukraine; our engagement throughout the Indo-Pacific, where we have been building relationships and partnerships that are stronger than they\u2019ve ever been, whether it\u2019s with our allies \u2013 Japan, Korea, Australia, or New Zealand \u2013 whether it\u2019s with countries like the Philippines and India, or whether it\u2019s with emerging countries like Vietnam or Indonesia,\u201d Blinken said.\n\nAnalysts agreed\n\n\u201cIt's actually a fair percentage of his presidency still left, an eighth of this presidency is still left, and there continue to be real challenges, both at home in terms of lowering costs, in terms of protecting consumers from junk fees and protecting workers from terrible rules that benefit corporations and overseas,\u201d said Navin Nayak, president and executive director of the Center for American Progress Action Fund.\n\n\u201cSo trying to bring a cease-fire and peace in the Middle East, trying to continue to push back against Russia's war in Ukraine, I think the president is now squarely focused on those challenges and unburdened from the real rigors of having to also run a presidential campaign,\u201d Nayak said.\n\nAnd this situation also leaves foreign leaders in an interesting position, as Israel\u2019s prime minister is learning this week as he prepares to meet with Biden, Harris and Trump.\n\nJeremi Suri, a history professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said, \u201cI do think Biden has one problem internationally, which is that foreign leaders know he's not going to be around after a few more months, and so they're going to be hesitant to make deals with him because they know that whoever comes next \u2026 and even if it is Harris, she is likely to have her own foreign policy team and her own set of aims.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, I think foreign leaders will want to accomplish things they can get accomplished quickly with Biden because they're not sure what will happen next,\u201d Suri said.\n\nEditor's note: This story has been updated to correct former President Donald Trump's age.",

        "text": "Biden says nothing can get in way of saving democracy, including \"personal ambition\"\nAddressing the nation on camera for the first time since announcing his decision not to run for reelection, President Biden said in the Oval Office that saving democracy is more important than any title, and he acknowledged it was time to \"pass the torch\" to a new generation of leaders.\n\nYears ago, Mr. Biden called himself a transitional candidate, and listed Vice President Kamala Harris among the younger generation of leaders he saw as the future of the Democratic Party. Now is the time to make way for those newer, younger voices, he said, like that of Harris, whom he has endorsed for the nomination.\n\nThough he did not mention Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump by name, Mr. Biden has referred to Trump as a threat to democracy.\n\n\"I believe my record as president, my leadership in the world, my vision for America's future, all merited a second term,\" the president said. \"But nothing, nothing, can come in the way of saving our democracy. That includes personal ambition. So, I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That's the best way to unite our nation. You know, there is a time and a place for long years of experience in public life. But there's also a time and a place for new voices, fresh voices, yes, younger voices. And that time and place is now.\"\n\nMr. Biden hinted that he had arrived at the decision to drop out in part because of doubts over whether he could defeat Trump.\n\n\"I revere this office, but I love my country more,\" the president said. \"It's been the honor of my life to serve as your president. But in the defense of democracy, which is at stake, I think it's more important than any title.\"\n\nMr. Biden took a moment to reflect and marvel at where his life had begun, long before his 51-year-long political journey.\n\n\"Nowhere else on earth could a kid with a stutter from modest beginnings in Scranton and Claymont one day sit behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office as president of the United States,\" he said. \"But here I am. That's what's so special about America.\"\n\nThe president expressed his gratitude to the American people, and praised the country as a nation of possibilities.\n\n\"It has been the privilege of my life to serve this nation for over 50 years,\" he said, adding, \"I have given my heart and my soul to so many nation, like so many others. I'm blessed a million times in return with the love and support of the American people. I hope you have some idea of how grateful I am, to all of you.\"\n\nPresident Biden speaks from the Oval Office of the White House on July 24, 2024 about his reasons for abruptly ending his run for a second term.

He plans to continue to try to lower costs for families, defend personal freedoms, protect the right to vote, and fight against cancer. He said he also plans to continue to speak out against gun violence, and call for Supreme Court reform.\n\nAbroad, the president said he would continue to make NATO stronger, support Ukraine's fight for freedom, and work to end the war in Gaza.\n\nAnd Mr. Biden, who ran on the idea that democracy itself was at stake in 2020 and is again in 2024 with Donald Trump as the Republican nominee, reminded Americans that they are the ones who will determine America's destiny: \"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule. The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America \u2013 lies in your hands.\"\n\nThe president also listed what he believes are his greatest achievements, including lowering the racial wealth gap, passing bipartisan infrastructure funding, achieving wins against big Pharma, lowering the cost of prescription drugs, compensating veterans exposed to toxic materials and putting the first African American woman on the Supreme Court.\n\nHundreds of White House staffers remained to watch Mr. Biden's address, and he emerged afterward from the Oval Office to greet them, to huge cheers.\n\nA great team saying thank you to a great President. pic.twitter.com/kXgRaFYhCE \u2014 Herbie Ziskend (@HerbieZiskend46) July 25, 2024\n\nA Trump campaign official confirmed that the GOP nominee also watched the president's speech from his plane after a rally in Charlotte; New York Times photographer Doug Mills snapped a picture.\n\nDemocrats have fallen in line behind Harris, after Mr. Biden endorsed her for the nomination soon after announcing he would end his campaign. Mr. Biden cannot appoint a successor for the Democratic nomination, but since his announcement on Sunday, Harris has secured the endorsements of a majority of Democratic delegates.\n\nThe president has said little since his decision while he recovered from COVID-19 symptoms at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. The White House said Tuesday that he had tested negative, and Mr. Biden told reporters upon his return from Delaware that he's feeling \"well.\"\n\nOval Office addresses are rare for a president, including for Mr. Biden. Before last week, Mr. Biden had only delivered two Oval Office addresses in his three-and-a-half years as president. Last week, he delivered his third Oval Office address, following the assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump.\n\nAlthough Mr. Biden plans to participate in the campaign, stepping down from the Democratic ticket allows him to focus on the task of the presidency itself, away from the physically taxing campaign trail.\n\n\"I'm not going anywhere,\" the president told his campaign staff \u2014 who are now Harris's campaign staff \u2014 Monday. \"I'm going to be out there on the campaign with her, with Kamala. I'm going to be working like hell, both as a sitting president, getting legislation passed, as well as \u2014 and campaigning.\"\n\nThis Oval Office address, as well as any speech the president gives next month at the Democratic National Convention, is among the most critical of not just Mr. Biden's presidency, but of his legacy, as he completes more than five decades in public service.\n\n\"In just a few months, the American people will choose the course of America's future,\" the president said from the Oval Office. \"I made my choice. I've made my views known. I would like to thank our great vice president, Kamala Harris. She's experienced, she's tough, she's capable. She's been an incredible partner to me, and a leader for our country. Now the choice is up to you, the American people.\"\n\nNancy Cordes and Nikole Killion contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Biden explains decision to drop out of election: \u2018Best way to unite our nation\u2019\nJoe Biden addressed the nation Wednesday to explain his historic decision to withdraw from the presidential race, delivering a reflective and hopeful message about the need to begin a new chapter in America\u2019s story.\n\n\u201cI believe my record as president, my leadership in the world, my vision for America\u2019s future all merited a second term, but nothing \u2013 nothing \u2013 can come in the way of saving our democracy. That includes personal ambition,\u201d Biden said in the Oval Office.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019ve decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. It\u2019s the best way to unite our nation. You know, there is a time and a place for long years of experience in public life. There\u2019s also a time and a place for new voices, fresh voices \u2013 yes, younger voices. And that time and place is now.\u201d\n\nThe speech came three days after Biden stunned the country with the announcement he would abandon his presidential campaign less than four months before election day. As he contemplated the legacy of his five decades in public life, Biden pledged to keep working to better Americans\u2019 lives as he concludes his first \u2013 and now only \u2013 term as president. Some Republican lawmakers have suggested Biden should resign rather than finish out his term, but the president firmly rejected those calls on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cOver the next six months, I\u2019ll be focused on doing my job as president,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means I\u2019ll continue to lower costs for hard-working families [and] grow our economy. I\u2019ll keep defending our personal freedoms and our civil rights \u2013 from the right to vote to the right to choose.\u201d\n\nBiden specifically vowed to \u201ckeep working to end the war in Gaza, bring home all the hostages and bring peace and security to the Middle East\u201d. Hours before Biden\u2019s speech, Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, delivered a divisive address to a rare joint session of Congress in which he called for \u201ctotal victory\u201d in the war.\n\nBiden cited his own leadership on foreign policy, including his staunch support for Ukraine amid its war against Russia, as one of his proudest accomplishments. He reminded voters about the legislation he has signed to tackle the climate crisis, reduce gun violence and expand healthcare access. Harkening back to the day of his inauguration in 2021, weeks after the January 6 attack on the Capitol and less than a year into the start of the coronavirus pandemic, Biden marveled at how far the country had come in such a short time.\n\n\u201cWe were in the grip of the worst pandemic in the century, the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, the worst attack on our democracy since the civil war,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe came together as Americans. We got through it. We emerged stronger, more prosperous and more secure.\u201d\n\nAfter withdrawing from the race on Sunday, Biden endorsed his vice-president, Kamala Harris, who has already consolidated the support of enough delegates to capture the Democratic nomination next month. In his speech, Biden reiterated his praise of Harris and underscored the immense choice facing voters this November.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to thank our great vice-president, Kamala Harris,\u201d Biden said. \u201cShe\u2019s experienced, she\u2019s tough, she\u2019s capable. She\u2019s been an incredible partner to me and a leader for our country. Now the choice is up to you, the American people.\u201d\n\nBefore Biden\u2019s announcement on Sunday, more than 30 Democratic members of Congress had called on the president to drop out of the race following his disastrous debate performance last month. In the days leading up to the announcement, polls showed an increasing number of Democrats believed Biden should step aside as Donald Trump\u2019s narrow lead in the race began to grow.\n\nEarly surveys taken since Sunday suggest a neck-and-neck race between Trump and Harris, but the vice-president already appears to be in a slightly stronger position than Biden was. Even as polls indicate a tight race, Biden expressed confidence that Americans would choose to preserve democracy this November. Quoting the Declaration of Independence and founding father Benjamin Franklin, Biden made the time-honored argument for American exceptionalism.\n\n\u201cAmerica is an idea, an idea stronger than any army, bigger than any ocean, more powerful than any dictator or tyrant. It\u2019s the most powerful idea in the history of the world,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThat idea is that we hold these truths to be self-evident. We\u2019re all created equal, endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights: life, liberty, pursuit of happiness. We\u2019ve never fully lived up to it, to this sacred idea, but we\u2019ve never walked away from it either, and I do not believe the American people will walk away from it now.\u201d\n\nIt was a message that echoed Biden\u2019s campaign slogan in 2020, which framed the election against Trump as a \u201cbattle for the soul of the nation\u201d. That battle remains ongoing, Biden said, and it will now be up to the American people to decide how it will end.\n\n\u201cThe great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule. The people do,\u201d Biden said. \u201cHistory is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America lies in your hands. You just have to keep faith \u2013 keep the faith \u2013 and remember who we are.\u201d\n\nShortly after Biden spoke, Barack Obama, under whom Biden served as vice-president for two terms, thanked him. On X, Obama quoted part of a line from the speech \u2013 \u201cThe truth, the sacred cause of this country, is larger than any one of us\u201d \u2013 and said, \u201cJoe Biden has stayed true to these words again and again over a lifetime of service to the American people.\u201d Obama has so far notably refrained from endorsing Kamala Harris as the Democratic candidate.\n\nThe House speaker emerita, Nancy Pelosi, said in a statement that Biden had shown he was on the right side of both history and the future. In a statement released after Biden\u2019s Oval Office address, she called him \u201cone of America\u2019s most consequential presidents\u201d.\n\nAnd the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, called Biden\u2019s decision to withdraw \u201ca great act of patriotism for this country you love so much\u201d.",

        "text": "NEA Thanks President Biden, Endorses Vice President Kamala Harris in General Election\nOver the last four years, President Biden distinguished himself as the most pro-public education, pro-union president in history as educators have partnered with him, First Lady Jill Biden, and Vice President Kamala Harris to help ensure every student has access to the resources and learning opportunities needed to thrive.\n\n\"We celebrate President Biden\u2019s legacy and will be forever grateful for his leadership, and we respect his decision. Educators understand what is at stake in this election. Our students\u2019 futures will be shaped by the decisions made in the Oval Office over the next four years, and the future of our public schools, freedoms, and democracy is on the ballot this fall,\u201d said National Education Association President, Becky Pringle.\n\nand their students have and continue to feel the positive impacts of a leader in the White House who cares about the work they do each day. shared leadership of President Biden and Vice President Harris, delivered for educators and students by expanding access to school meals for 5 million students (about twice the population of Mississippi), investing in student mental health, and providing student debt relief for millions of educators and working families.\n\nNEA members are looking now for a new leader equally dedicated to building the future our students, educators, and families deserve.\n\n\u201cWe can elect a president who will make sure our students can live into their full brilliance and be exactly who they are without apology or a president who will demonize them and privatize our schools,\u201d said Pringle.\n\nPresident Harris to Lead the Nation\n\nconvened its Board of Directors, to vote on a new endorsement for the presidential election, having previously recommended Biden. is made up of NEA members from every state and all job classifications including teachers, ed techs, bus drivers, and more. The Board is elected to office by educators in their respective home states.\n\n\u201cThe Biden-Harris administration has demonstrated strong support for our public schools and students. This is the type of leadership we need in Washington. As an elementary school music teacher, and President of North Carolina Association of Educators, I am confident that Vice President Harris will continue prioritizing the needs of our students while also backing the educators who tirelessly serve in our public schools,\" said Tamika Walker Kelly.\n\nNEA President Pringle echoed the sentiment of educators around the nation following the endorsement, adding now is the time to unite and ensure Donald Trump, a convicted felon, who has gutted public school programs and plans more of the same does not win in November.\n\n\u201cVice President Kamala Harris is a tireless advocate for students, public education, and working families. She has the experience, qualifications and dedication needed to continue delivering for students, educators and working families. She has delivered time and again for students and educators, and educators know we can count on her continued partnership in expanding access to free school meals for students, investing in student mental health, working to ensure no educator has to carry the weight of crushing student debt and, doing everything possible to keep our communities and schools safe,\u201d said President Pringle.",

        "text": "July 23, 2024, presidential campaign news\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg speaks with CNN's Kaitlan Collins on Tuesday, July 23. CNN\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who was speaking Tuesday to CNN in his personal capacity, said he has not spoken with Vice President Kamala Harris about being her potential running mate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had one conversation with her and it was on Sunday and it was about how excited I am for her to lead this party and the fact that I was going to support her. The ticket did not come up,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins on \u201cThe Source,\u201d as the conversation around who Harris may choose as her running mate intensifies.\n\nButtigieg also said that former President Donald Trump \u2014 who is suggesting the next debate move from the agreed-upon host network, ABC, to the friendlier confines of Fox News \u2014 is scared to debate Harris.\n\n\u201cWhat changed from when he said he was ready to do an ABC debate and when he now says he\u2019s not? ABC didn\u2019t change. Donald Trump didn\u2019t change. But there\u2019s a new candidate and clearly he hesitates to debate her on the exact same terms,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also called Trump\u2019s choice of JD Vance \u201cregrettable\u201d because the Republican senator from Ohio \u201cis somebody who was at his most convincing and effective when he talked about how unfit for office Donald Trump is, and he has not explained any reason other than of course \u2014 his obvious interest in power \u2014 why he would have changed his mind on that.\u201d\n\nButtigieg also responded to a 2021 clip of Vance criticizing the transportation secretary, Harris and Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez by saying \u201cthe entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children.\u201d\n\nButtigieg, who has since become a father to two children with his husband Chasten, said, \u201cThe really sad thing is he said that after Chasten and I had been through a fairly heartbreaking setback in our adoption journey.\n\n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t have known that, but maybe that\u2019s why you shouldn\u2019t be talking about other people\u2019s children,\u201d Buttigieg said, adding that \u201cit\u2019s not about his kids or my kids or the vice president\u2019s family. It\u2019s about your family, people\u2019s families whose wellbeing will depend on whether we go into the future led by somebody like Kamala Harris, who is focused on expanding the prosperity, the freedom, the well-being of our families.\u201d\n\nHarris has two stepchildren with her husband Doug Emhoff.",

        "text": "American Oversight Files Emergency Motion to Prevent Illegal Georgia State Election Board Rules from Taking Effect\nToday, nonpartisan watchdog organization American Oversight filed a motion for an interlocutory injunction and a temporary restraining order against the Georgia State Election Board (SEB) for violating the state\u2019s Open Meetings Act by holding a rushed meeting on July 12, during which it approved two controversial rules without legally required public notice or a quorum.\n\nStatement from American Oversight Interim Executive Director Chioma Chukwu:\n\n\u201cThe illegal rules approved by three rogue board members \u2014 reportedly acting at the behest of Republican Party operatives \u2014 could wreak havoc this November as anti-democratic actors seek to sway results in favor of their preferred candidates by undermining trust in our elections.\n\n\u201cWithout immediate court intervention, Georgia voters and election workers will be deprived of their right to shape rules that impact their ability to safely participate in free and fair elections. We trust the court will recognize the urgency and prevent the rules from advancing, protecting Georgians from irreparable harm.\u201d\n\nOn July 18, American Oversight filed a lawsuit against the SEB in Fulton County Superior Court seeking, among other things, injunctive and declaratory relief as well as civil penalties against board members Rick Jeffares, Janelle King, and Janice Johnston for their knowing and willful violations of the Open Meetings Act.\n\nAmerican Oversight sued following reports that Jeffares, King, and Johnston convened an illegal and last-minute meeting on July 12 to approve two controversial rule changes. The meeting was held without proper notice and quorum, and reportedly against the advice of the state attorney general\u2019s office.\n\nOne of the rules, proposed by Jeffares, requires county election boards to post daily online ballot counts on their websites. Subsequent reporting revealed that the rule text was provided to Jeffares by Georgia GOP Chairman Josh McKoon in apparent coordination with the Republican National Committee. The other rule purports to increase the number of partisan poll monitors observing ballot counting at Georgia tabulation centers, a reportedly similar version of which was also shared by the state\u2019s Republican Party.\n\nPrior to filing suit, American Oversight had sent a letter to the SEB indicating it would consider legal action if the board failed to publicly declare, within 48 hours, that its July 12 meeting violated Georgia law and that any rules approved during the meeting were invalid. The SEB has failed to respond to the letter and has not taken any steps or made any public commitment to walk back its unlawful conduct.\n\nAmerican Oversight and Atlanta-based law firm Caplan Cobb LLC are co-counsel in this case.\n\nThe complaint and the motion for preliminary injunction are available here: https://www.americanoversight.org/document/complaint-american-oversight-v-georgia-state-election-board-open-meetings-act-violation",

(Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nThe Pew-Knight Initiative supports new research on how Americans absorb civic information, form beliefs and identities, and engage in their communities. Pew Research Center is a nonpartisan, nonadvocacy fact tank that informs the public about the issues, attitudes and trends shaping the world. Knight Foundation is a social investor committed to supporting informed and engaged communities. Learn more >\n\nHow we did this Pew Research Center conducted this study to better understand how U.S. adults get news about local government and politics, as well as their attitudes toward this coverage. It is the second report in a series focused on local news. The survey of 5,146 U.S. adults was conducted from Jan. 22 to 28, 2024. Everyone who completed the survey is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology. Refer to the topline for the questions used for this survey, along with responses, and to the methodology for more details. This is a Pew Research Center report from the Pew-Knight Initiative, a research program funded jointly by The Pew Charitable Trusts and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. Find related reports online at https://www.pewresearch.org/pew-knight/.\n\nThis is the second report in a series focused on local news. Read our first report, \u201cAmericans\u2019 Changing Relationship With Local News,\u201d and our third report, \u201cAmericans\u2019 Experiences With Local Crime News.\u201d\n\nAmericans want information about local government and politics. Most say they are at least somewhat interested in news about local laws and policies and local elections. And about two-thirds say they often or sometimes get local political news \u2013 higher than the shares who get news on several other local topics, including the economy and sports.\n\nBut among Americans who get news on local politics, only a quarter are highly satisfied with the quality of the news they get, according to a new Pew Research Center survey. Those who get news about weather, traffic and several other topics are more likely to be satisfied with the news they get in those areas.\n\nAmericans also do not widely see it as easy to find the news and information they need to take part in the local political process. Fewer than half of U.S. adults (45%) say it is very or somewhat easy to find the information they need to make voting decisions in local elections. By comparison, 59% say it is easy to find the information they need for presidential elections.\n\nIn both cases, much higher shares of Americans say they are at least somewhat interested in news about elections than say it is easy to find the information they need to vote.\n\nThere is virtually no difference between Democrats and Republicans (including independents who lean toward each party) in the shares who say it is easy to find the information they need to vote locally. But younger adults are less likely than those ages 50 and older to say it is easy to be an informed local voter.\n\nJump to more information on how U.S. adults view local political news.\n\nWe asked these questions to better understand how Americans get local political news at a time when many local news outlets are struggling, local news consumption habits are becoming more digital, and public attention to local news is declining. This report, the second in a series focused on local news, is part of the Pew-Knight Initiative, a research program funded jointly by The Pew Charitable Trusts and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation.\n\nOther key findings about Americans\u2019 experiences with local political news include:\n\nAmericans most often get local political news from friends and family, local news outlets, and social media\n\nU.S. adults get news about local government and politics from a variety of different sources. The most common are friends, family and neighbors (70%) and local news outlets (66%).\n\nJust over half (54%) also say they often or sometimes get news about local politics from social media.\n\nSmaller shares say they at least sometimes get local political news from local government websites (32%), local nonprofits or advocacy groups (31%), or local politicians (30%).\n\nThere are gaps between younger and older adults in some of the sources they turn to for local political news:\n\n71% of U.S. adults ages 18 to 29 get news about local government and politics from social media often or sometimes, compared with 36% of those 65 and older.\n\nConversely, Americans 65 and older are more inclined than adults under 30 to get local political news from local news outlets (75% vs. 53%) and from local politicians (39% vs. 20%).\n\nSimilar shares of older and younger adults get news about local politics from friends, family and neighbors.\n\nJump to more details about Americans\u2019 sources for local political news.\n\nAmericans are more interested in news about national politics than local politics\n\nIn general, nearly identical shares of Americans say they follow local news and national news very or somewhat closely. But when it comes to politics in particular, there is more interest in news about national politics than local politics.\n\nAmericans are more likely to say they are at least somewhat interested in presidential elections (81%) than local elections (70%). The gap is even larger when looking at the share who are extremely or very interested in presidential (54%) and local (34%) elections.\n\nU.S. adults also are more likely to say they are extremely or very interested in national laws and policies (50%) than local laws and policies (42%).\n\nThere is no significant difference between Republicans and Democrats in the shares who are at least somewhat interested in news about their local elections (73% and 71%, respectively) or local laws and policies (83% and 82%).\n\nAmericans who are more attached to their local community are more interested in and satisfied with local political news\n\nThere are clear links between Americans\u2019 sense of community attachment and their experiences with news on local government and politics. Those who feel more attached to their community have more interest in news about local laws and local elections, higher satisfaction with the quality of their local political news, and an easier time finding the information they need to vote.\n\n91% of Americans who feel very attached to their community are at least somewhat interested in news about local laws and policies, compared with 68% of those who are not very or not at all attached. A similar pattern holds for interest in news about local elections.\n\nA majority of Americans with a strong sense of community connection (61%) say it is at least somewhat easy to find the information they need to make voting decisions in local elections. Among those with little or no sense of community attachment, just 34% feel this way.\n\nAmong U.S. adults who follow news about local government and politics, four-in-ten of those with strong community attachment are extremely or very satisfied with the local political news they get \u2013 more than double the share among those who feel little or no attachment to their community (16%).\n\nCommunity attachment remains an important factor in these opinions independent of whether people are registered to vote or how closely they follow local political news.\n\nJump to more details about the link between community attachment and local political news consumption.",

        "text": "Which third-party candidates are running for president in 2024?\nAfter President Joe Biden announced he was dropping out of the presidential election and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, a November faceoff between former President Donald Trump and Harris is almost solidified.\n\nWhile the candidates for the two major parties are nearly locked in, a slate of third-party candidates, including independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Green Party member Jill Stein, and Libertarian Chase Oliver, is still holding on.\n\nAt the beginning of the election, nearly two dozen candidates started out in the race, but seven remain. Here are the third-party candidates running to take the White House.\n\nMore:Election live updates: Harris to make first campaign stop in battleground state\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., the independent presidential candidate launched his campaign for the Democratic nomination in April 2023. He later dropped his Democratic bid in October and re-entered the race as an independent, calling the traditional two-party system \u201crigged\u201d for Americans.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nKennedy, an environmental lawyer and the nephew of former President John F. Kennedy is still in the process of getting on the ballot in multiple states as an independent candidate. In 2021, Kennedy was a prominent spreader of medical falsehoods and conspiracies about the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nJill Stein\n\nPhysician and environmental activist Jill Stein is not new to the presidential ballot. She ran for the White House as a member of the Green Party in both 2012 and 2016. Stein, 73, announced in November 2023 that she will be seeking the party's nomination for a third time in the 2024 election.\n\nStein, who has called for abolishing student and medical debt, received criticism from Democrats who argued that she took votes from former Secretary of State and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election after she garnered more votes than the margin of Trump's victory in three swing states.\n\nCornell West\n\nCornell West, 71, launched his presidential campaign in June 2023 under the People's Party, but he has since announced he is running as an independent.\n\nWest is a philosopher, activist, and author who has taught at Harvard University, Yale University, Union Theological Seminary, and other institutions. He has promised to end poverty and guarantee housing and has been a vocal critic of Israel for its part in the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nChase Oliver\n\nChase Oliver, 38, is running under the Libertarian Party as the youngest presidential candidate vying for the White House in 2024.\n\nOliver, an openly gay anti-war activist, unsuccessfully ran in the 2020 special election for Georgia's 5th Congressional District and ran in a tight race for U.S. Senate in 2022. He clinched the Libertarian Party nomination over RFK Jr. and Trump.\n\nMarianne Williamson\n\nMarianne Williamson, 71, launched her White House bid in March 2023 after unsuccessfully running for president in 2020. Williamson, a self-help author and Oprah\u2019s former spiritual leader, co-founded the Peace Alliance in 2004, which aims to \u201cmobilize people into action to transform systems and public policy toward a culture of peace.\u201d\n\nWilliamson is technically still running, but she hasn't secured any delegates in state primaries and will likely not receive the Democratic nomination in August",

        "text": "Running for US president is a costly business\nIn a new article for The Conversation, Steven Daniels, Lecturer in Law and Politics at Edge Hill University, looks at the rules governing the finances of standing as a US presidential candidate\n\nIt costs a lot of money to become president of the United States. The 2020 presidential election cycle involved campaign expenditure of US$14 billion (\u00a311 billion) \u2013 an amount that will almost certainly be beaten in November 2024.\n\nBy Sunday 2 June, and after a buoyant Republican National Convention at which he was endorsed as the party\u2019s candidate for the November election, data recorded by the US Federal Election Commission (FEC) had challenger Donald Trump leading incumbent president Joe Biden in the fundraising stakes by $757 million to $746 million. This reflected a surge in the second quarter of the year in which Trump had outdone Biden by nearly $100 million.\n\nBut then, after weeks of speculation following a lacklustre debate performance in June and a series of gaffe-laden public appearances, Biden announced he would not seek re-election. Instead he endorsed his vice-president, Kamala Harris.\n\nBy that evening it was reported that Harris had already raised more than $46 million. The following day, The New York Times reported that Harris had raised $81 million in the first 24 hours since announcing her presidential bid.\n\nThe sudden change of presidential nominee has required fundraising groups that previously supported the Biden-Harris ticket to pivot to Harris, a process which isn\u2019t as simple as it sounds. For example, the Haley Voters for Biden Political Action Committee (PAC) has had to rebrand to Haley Voters for Harris.\n\nPACs must be registered with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) in order to spend on behalf of their candidate \u2013 hence the rush, in case the money raised in Biden\u2019s original name is not allowed to be used to support Harris\u2019s candidacy.\n\nComplex system\n\nThe complex US political funding and financing system can often be very confusing. Federal laws aim to set limits on funding both for presidential campaigns and for politicians running for Congress. But the reality is very different, and as a result, money flows from multiple directions.\n\nWhile an individual can only directly donate a maximum of $3,300 to a federal candidate, numerous other avenues to donate exist, and an individual could ultimately spend as much as $123,500 on a candidate per two-year election cycle. But this amount is just the formal spending limit.\n\nUS electoral law attempts to formalise the amount of money a presidential candidate can receive and spend. But almost every attempt at legislating to control funding is subsequently found to contain a loophole.\n\nEven within this patchy legal environment, anyone wanting to lobby or otherwise influence a presidential candidate had a range of other ways of getting money to them, principally through the use of tax-exempt PACs.\n\nPACS and Super PACs\n\nPACs have existed since 1943. A PAC is set up by a business, labour union or pressure groups in order to fund a candidate. They can\u2019t take money directly from businesses or unions, but they can accept donations from individuals, up to $5,000 per year. They are allowed to give $5,000 to individual politicians and $15,000 a year to political parties. They can also spend an unlimited amount on political advertising, as long as it is not directly linked to a candidate. There is a limit to how many \u201cVote Harris\u201d ads it can buy, but none on \u201cVote for fair abortion laws\u201d, for example.\n\nSuper PACs were created by a Supreme Court judgment in 2010: Citizens United v FEC (2010). The case involved a conservative non-profit group called Citizens United which had made a film, Hillary the Movie, critical of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. The FEC ruled that it amounted to unlawful electioneering content and prevented it being shown on cable before the 2008 primaries.\n\nThe case ended up before the Supreme Court, which ruled that this was in conflict with the First Amendment right to free speech. The effective result of this judgment allowed Super PACS to raise and spend unlimited funds, provided they do not contribute directly towards a candidate\u2019s campaign \u2013 they often get around this by spending the money on advertising, for example.\n\nThese are effective money-earning organisations: the pro-Biden Future Forward USA raised $150 million ahead of the 2020 election.\n\nSuch astronomical sums often lend themselves to suggestions of lobbying, or undue influence by large donors over candidates. Lobbying is regulated by the Lobbying Disclosure Act 1995. This requires lobbyists to register with Congress. It also specifies how money can be spent.\n\nThe Honest Leadership and Open Government Act 2007 strengthened the 1995 Act by tightening rules on public disclosure. But it hasn\u2019t stopped wealthy lobbying groups (or individuals) from simply donating through other avenues, such as Super PACs, as the act specifies only those directly lobbying members of the executive or legislature must register.\n\nThis can be seen in the donations made by, for example, the Koch family: their Americans for Prosperity Action group spent nearly $500 million in the 2020 election cycle alone on Republican candidates and causes.\n\nThis can make it difficult for smaller candidates to break through. But yet progress is being made. Bernie Sanders raised nearly $180 million in his 2020 presidential bid through online crowdfunding, from voters who tended to be younger, more working class, or otherwise felt disenfranchised.\n\nThese tactics were adapted and advanced by more mainstream candidates. In his 2020 campaign, Biden raised $656.8 million in contributions of $200 or under, and Trump $483.9 million. Trump has also become adept at selling merchandise in order to fill his campaign coffers, such as raising over $7 million through selling t-shirts featuring his Fulton County Jail mugshot, suggesting campaigns are constantly finding new ways to raise cash.\n\nSpending will undoubtedly ratchet up as November moves closer, and candidates find themselves with multiple avenues to attract funding. In the end, $14 billion may ultimately be a drop in the ocean, given the stakes and importance of this election. Both Trump and Harris will find themselves in need of every cent they can attract, direct or indirect.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

I look forward to formally accepting the nomination soon.\n\n\"I am grateful to President Biden and everyone in the Democratic Party who has already put their faith in me, and I look forward to taking our case directly to the American people.\"\n\nAccording to an Associated Press tally, Ms Harris had 2,214 delegates, well beyond the simple majority needed to clinch the nomination on the first ballot.\n\nThe survey is unofficial, as Democratic delegates are free to vote for the candidate of their choice and she will not be the official candidate until what is known as the roll call is completed, whether virtually or in person at the Democratic Party Convention from 19 August in Chicago.\n\nMs Harris has been working to secure endorsements from a majority of its delegates and if she wins the nomination, she will need to pick a running mate.\n\nMichigan governor Gretchen Whitmer, seen as a possible rival for the Democratic nomination after Mr Biden's exit, has backed Ms Harris in a post on X, saying the vice president had her full support.\n\nSeveral other potential Democratic challengers, including California governor Gavin Newsom and Kentucky governor Andy Beshear, have also supported Ms Harris's bid. Former House speaker Nancy Pelosi has also backed Ms Harris.\n\nHowever, ex-president Barack Obama has not announced who he wants to be the party's nominee.\n\nImage: Joe Biden said he would not be seeking re-election. Pic: AP\n\nBiden makes first comments since quitting race\n\nJoe Biden vowed he is \"going to be working like hell\" in his final months as US president to campaign for Ms Harris to be his successor.\n\nHe was speaking in a phone call to staff at the campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, in his first public comments since he announced at the weekend he would be quitting the 2024 White House race and endorsing his vice president.\n\nMs Harris also addressed the workers in Delaware, where she hit out at Republican Donald Trump.\n\nThe vice president, 59, is the only declared Democratic candidate so far to be the party's nominee ahead of November's election against 78-year-old Mr Trump.\n\nMr Biden will return to the White House later today from his home in Delaware where he has been recovering from COVID.\n\nThe 81-year-old leader said on Sunday he was no longer standing for re-election after weeks of pressure from within his own party amid concerns about his health and fitness to serve another four years in office.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:41 Who is Kamala Harris?\n\nLatest updates: Biden surprises campaign staff with phone call\n\nMr Biden told supporters on Monday: \"I'm not going anywhere. I'm going to be out there on the campaign with her, with Kamala. I'm going to be working like hell. Both as a sitting president, getting legislation passed, as well as campaigning.\"\n\nMr Biden added that even though \"I won't be on the ticket... I'm still going to be fully, fully engaged\".\n\n\"I've got six months left of my presidency, I'm determined to get as much done as I possibly can. Both foreign policy and domestic policy.\"\n\nOn supporting Ms Harris, he said: \"I'll be doing whatever Kamala wants me or needs me to do... We're still fighting in this fight together.\"\n\nHe hit out at Mr Trump, saying he was \"still a danger to the communities, a danger to the nation\".\n\nMs Harris then began by saying \"I love you, Joe\" while the president stayed on the line.\n\nRead more on this story:\n\nWho could challenge Harris in race to replace Biden?\n\nWould Michelle Obama run?\n\nAnalysis: Biden became a liability for Democrats\n\nShe said: \"Over the next 106 days we are going to take our case to the American people and we are going to win.\"\n\nMs Harris said Mr Biden created millions of jobs and \"got the COVID pandemic under control\".\n\nShe also said Mr Biden \"stood up\" for democracy at home and abroad.\n\nDiscussing her time as a state prosecutor, she said she \"took on perpetrators of all kinds\".\n\nShe added: \"I know Donald Trump's type, and in this campaign I will proudly put my record against his.\"\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:32 Biden's legacy 'unmatched in modern history'\n\nMs Harris said: \"Building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency.\"\n\nShe also pledged an \"assault weapons ban\" and said she would fight for \"reproductive freedom\".\n\nEarlier on Monday, at an event for college athletes in the White House grounds, Ms Harris said Mr Biden's legacy of accomplishment was unmatched in modern history.\n\nHe is currently recovering from COVID, with Ms Harris saying he is \"feeling much better\".\n\nHer campaign has said it has raised $81m (\u00a362m) in its first 24 hours.\n\nThe team said the 24-hour figure was the biggest of \"any candidate in history\".\n\nThe $81m is in addition to an existing, almost $250m (\u00a3193m) \"war chest\" which was raised \"across the campaign, Democratic National Committee, and joint fundraising committees\".\n\nSpreaker Spreaker , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

        "text": "Middle East Leaders Prefer Trump\u2019s Victory\nDonald J. Trump\u2019s candidacy seems to draw more interest and support from the Middle East than from other areas of the world, particularly from among the ruling elite in influential countries like Israel and in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries. Saudi support for Trump may not be surprising given that current US President Joe Biden was sharply critical of Riyadh during his 2020 presidential election campaign, slights that the Saudi leadership has not forgotten. But Joe Biden\u2019s low poll numbers in Israel are indeed a surprise given his tight embrace of the country following the October 7 Hamas attack and his substantial support for Israel\u2019s ongoing campaign in the Gaza Strip. The Democratic Party, especially its progressive wing, has become much more critical of Israel than the Republicans, and any Democratic nominee who will replace Biden\u2014such as Vice President Kamala Harris\u2014is not likely to change this dynamic and may even wind up boosting Trump\u2019s standing there.\n\nOther states in the region, such as Bahrain, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) may also be more supportive of Trump than a Democratic nominee but are keeping their cards close to their chests. Their support derives at least partly from an expectation that as in Trump\u2019s 2017-2021 presidency, a second Trump administration would pay little attention to sensitive issues like human rights. They also believe that Trump, with his unusual style of diplomacy, may be able to end the war in Gaza\u2014something that the Biden administration has not been able to do.\n\nCultivating the Saudis\n\nThe Saudis undoubtedly remember with nostalgia that Trump chose their country as the first foreign state he visited as president. They did have misgivings about him during the 2016 campaign when he railed against immigrants from Muslim majority countries and then banned their entry to the United States soon after taking office. But Saudis received Trump\u2019s May 2017 speech in Riyadh well, as he assured them and other assembled leaders of Arab and Muslim countries that he would not pressure them to democratize. He stated,\n\nOur partnerships will advance security through stability, not through radical disruption. We will make decisions based on real-world outcomes \u2013 not inflexible ideology\u2026 And, wherever possible, we will seek gradual reforms \u2013 not sudden intervention. We must seek partners, not perfection\u2014and to make allies of all who share our goals.\n\nTrump also touted the substantial economic links between Saudi Arabia and the United States. He emphasized that he had just signed \u201chistoric agreements with the Kingdom that will invest almost $400 billion in our two countries and create many thousands of jobs in America and Saudi Arabia,\u201d although much of this amount was part of previous deals.\n\nTrump continued this transactional foreign policy when he hosted Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman (MBS) in the White House in March 2018. In front of cameras, Trump displayed a large chart that supposedly showed Saudi purchases of US military items as if business and diplomacy were essentially the same thing. In addition, MBS\n\ncultivated a friendship with Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, whom Trump put in charge of Arab-Israeli peacemaking. Saudi Arabia did not formally endorse Trump\u2019s so called \u201cpeace plan\u201d for Israel and the Palestinians (which heavily favored the former), or the later Abraham Accords, in which Bahrain, Morocco, Sudan, and the UAE established diplomatic relations with Israel. But it is believed that MBS approved Bahrain\u2019s decision to join the Accords.\n\nTrump played a crucial role in trying to protect MBS in the wake of the gruesome murder of Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nFor his part, Trump played a crucial role in trying to protect MBS in the wake of the gruesome murder of Saudi dissident and US resident Jamal Khashoggi in October 2018 at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Although the Central Intelligence Agency assessed that MBS was responsible for ordering the murder, Trump made equivocal public statements about the crown prince\u2019s role. Trump also supported the Saudi role in the Yemen war, restoring US munitions that had been held up by the Obama administration and vetoing legislation that aimed to end US support for the Saudi military campaign.\n\nThat Trump did not hide his belief that he would likely run again in 2024 may have influenced MBS\u2019s position to override the doubts of Saudi investment experts in 2021 and place $2 billion of Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth in a new investment firm started by Kushner, who lacked experience in running such a venture. MBS is clearly banking (literally and figuratively) on a new Trump administration. In March 2024, with Republican Senator Lindsey Graham acting as conduit, Trump and MBS held a very friendly phone call with Trump reportedly touting his poll numbers to the de-facto Saudi leader.\n\nBiden\u2019s Pullout from the Race Will Not Alter the Saudi View\n\nAlthough at the moment it appears clear that Biden\u2019s replacement as Democratic nominee will be Vice President Harris, the Saudis will still likely prefer Trump. When Biden made the comment during his 2020 campaign that he would treat Saudi Arabia as a \u201cpariah,\u201d he did not get any pushback from his fellow Democrats (including Harris). Indeed, when Biden decided to visit Saudi Arabia in 2022\u2014largely to try to persuade the Saudis to produce more oil to address the fallout from Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine on energy prices\u2014he felt compelled to publish an op-ed in the Washington Post to justify his visit. Speaking largely to his fellow Democrats, he said, \u201cI know that there are many who disagree with my decision to travel to Saudi Arabia. My views on human rights are clear and long-standing\u2026\u201d He also reminded his readers that his administration \u201creversed the blank-check policy we inherited,\u201d citing his release of the intelligence community\u2019s report on the Khashoggi murder, sanctions on the Saudi unit involved in his killing, and visa bans on Saudi officials involved in harassing Saudi dissidents abroad.\n\nThe irony of these statements is that after the visit, the Biden administration immediately placed the Saudi human rights issue on the back burner. Although the Biden team was critical of many of Trump\u2019s policies, it hoped to build on the Abraham Accords as a way of achieving a diplomatic \u2018win\u2019 in the Middle East, especially after the disastrous US withdrawal from Afghanistan. In addition, with Israeli-Palestinian peace-making frozen, the administration hoped that inducing the Saudis to join the Abraham Accords would be a game-changer. However, this prospect became more complicated as the Saudis reportedly demanded a NATO-like security pact with Washington and US support for a Saudi civilian nuclear program as the price for normalizing relations with Israel.\n\nThe Biden team hoped to build on the Abraham Accords as a way of achieving a diplomatic \u2018win\u2019 in the Middle East\n\nThe war in Gaza has further complicated US-Saudi relations, as the Biden administration has tried to enlist Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states in a post-war reconstruction plan that would entail billions of dollars on their part. But until the war ends and the Israelis agree to return Gaza to Palestinian control (which they have refused to do), Riyadh and other Gulf capitals remain reticent. Saudi officials today may be happier with the Biden team than they once were, given its numerous visits to the kingdom in recent months, but they still seem more comfortable with Trump.\n\nIn addition to the Saudis\u2019 large investment gift to Kushner, the Trump family has been busy securing large business deals in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries. Trump\u2019s son Eric recently told the Financial Times that not only will the Trump organization be involved in developing a Trump tower in Jeddah, it will also partner with the Saudi real estate firm Dar Global in building a luxury resort and golf course in Oman. Already, the Trump organization operates a luxury golf course in Dubai in the UAE. Eric Trump implied that these deals were not a conflict of interest because \u201cI don\u2019t really deal with foreign governments,\u201d but this practice of mixing business with government is not new for Trump, nor for the Gulf states. The group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington reported that from December 2016 (soon after Trump was elected) to February 2017, Saudi lobbyists paid for about 500 rooms, worth $270,000, at Trump\u2019s Washington, DC hotel, and that when MBS visited New York in 2018, his entourage stayed at the Trump International Hotel in Manhattan, spiking the venue\u2019s revenue by 13 percent. As for the UAE, it spent up to $10,000 per night for rooms at the Trump Washington, DC hotel from late 2017 to mid-2018.\n\nTrump Still Popular in Israel\n\nDuring his presidency, Trump became very popular in Israel for his many gifts to the government. These included recognizing Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and moving the US Embassy to that city, recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Syrian Golan Heights, closing the US Consulate General in Jerusalem that mainly served the Palestinian community, and closing the PLO office in Washington. Trump\u2019s moves were so well received in Israel\u2014even outside of right-wing factions\u2014that during his 2019 election campaign Netanyahu produced giant billboards of Trump and him smiling together. But when Netanyahu congratulated Biden for winning the 2020 US presidential race, Trump took umbrage, and his relations with Netanyahu soured.\n\nAs is known, days after October 7, Biden flew to Israel where he not only embraced its leaders and met with relatives of the Hamas hostages, but even met with the Israeli war cabinet, reflecting his longstanding and deep Zionist beliefs. These acts as well as his advocacy for more military assistance to Israel, which Congress eventually passed, initially boosted Biden\u2019s standing in Israel. As the war in Gaza dragged on, however, and Palestinian civilian deaths mounted, Biden became more critical of Israel\u2019s military campaign, calling it \u201cover the top,\u201d and he pressed Israel to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza. These comments, and the short hold-up of 500-pound bombs to Israel (2,000 pound bombs are still under review), may have helped to turn many Israelis against Biden, which was evident in a May poll in Israel that found that 43 percent of Israelis supported Trump and just 32 percent backed Biden.\n\nTrump\u2019s moves were so well received in Israel that Netanyahu produced giant billboards of Trump and him smiling together.\n\nFar-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir called on Netanyahu not to approve a Gaza cease-fire/hostage deal because he did not want to give Biden a win prior to the US election. Although Biden\u2019s July 21 announcement that he would not run again has made this argument moot, and Ben-Gvir was criticized by Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party for suggesting it, indications are that Netanyahu prefers Trump and hopes to rekindle his close relationship with him. That Harris has exhibited a slightly different approach regarding the Israeli military campaign in the Gaza Strip only reinforces the notion that the Israeli leader is rooting for a Trump win.\n\nBoth Trump and his running mate, Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio, have opposed any restrictions on or criticisms of US support for Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, though Trump has said that Israel needs to get the war against Hamas \u201cover with fast.\u201d\n\nOther Countries in Silent Mode but Hoping for a Trump Win\n\nSeveral Arab countries that have longstanding ties to the United States, namely Egypt, the UAE, and Bahrain, have been more circumspect about the US presidential race, but are also likely quietly rooting for Trump. This is due in large part to the Democrats\u2019 rare criticism of the human rights situation in Arab authoritarian states and to the punitive measures that Democratic administrations have sometimes imposed on such countries for their abuses of the opposition.\n\nFor example, during the 2020 campaign, Biden tweeted that there would be \u201cno more blank checks for Trump\u2019s favorite dictator,\u201d Egypt\u2019s ruler Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, and once in office, he held up a portion ($130 million) of military aid to Cairo partly in response to US congressional pressure (largely coming from Democrats) over human rights. By contrast, Trump called Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi a \u201cfantastic guy\u201d in 2016 and later received him in the White House, which Biden has not done. But because the United States needs Cairo\u2019s help to resolve the war in Gaza, the Biden administration has dropped its public criticism of Egypt, and Biden himself has held several phone calls with Sisi on the Gaza situation. Nonetheless, Sisi and his government probably yearn for another Trump administration where their repression would not come under scrutiny. Similarly, Bahrain, ever since the 2011 crackdown, has occasionally been criticized by Democratic administrations, whereas Trump, in his last full day as president in January 2021, bestowed the Legion of Merit, Degree Chief Commander, on Bahraini King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa. And under Democratic administrations, the UAE has been subjected to criticism over allegations of \u201cfacilitating Russian economic activity\u201d and its role in the Yemen war, whereas the country seems to be a favorite of Trump and his family\u2019s business.\n\nThe Arab leader who may miss Biden the most is Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah, who has long had a friendly relationship with the US president. The Jordanian monarch believed Trump was overly indulgent of Netanyahu and opposed the Trump peace plan. If Trump were to win the presidency again, however, the king will try to reach an accommodation with him, as too much is at stake for Jordan if the Israeli-Palestinian situation remains unresolved.\n\nPreferences, and a Waiting Period\n\nGiven the unpredictable nature of the 2024 presidential election, Middle East leaders would do well to hedge their bets and avoid throwing their lot in with Trump prematurely. Kamala Harris appears to have secured the support of a majority of Democratic delegates to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next August and is expected to win the nomination. If she ends up winning the presidential race in November, these leaders will not only have to deal with a Democratic president who is close to Joe Biden and is likely to continue his policies, but also to work with America\u2019s first female president. The next few months will obviously be pivotal for both Trump and Harris as they navigate the presidential campaign, but they also provide Middle East leaders with an opportunity to critically evaluate how the two may or may not help them serve their countries\u2019 best national interests.\n\nThe views expressed in this publication are the author\u2019s own and do not necessarily reflect the position of Arab Center Washington DC, its staff, or its Board of Directors.\n\nFeatured image credit: SPA",

        "text": "Recap: Harris neck and neck with Trump in polls, as Wisconsin rally draws 3,000 supporters\nVice President Harris will likely win the Democratic nomination but still lose the presidency to Republican rival Trump, according to David Roche, president and global strategist at Quantum Strategy.\n\n\"I think she'll definitely be the [Democratic] candidate because if she wasn't the presidential candidate of the Democrats, there would be a degree of chaos, including affecting funding, which would mean the Democrats would be wiped across the board,\" he told \"Street Signs Europe\" on Tuesday, noting that this impact would also affect the Democrats' position in Congress and the House of Representatives.\n\nBut despite that forecast on Harris securing the formal Democratic endorsement and foreseeing a \"closer race than people imagined\" during the fall elections, Roche stressed, \"I don't think she can beat Trump.\"\n\n\"I suspect that Donald Trump will be the next president of the United States. And markets will start to wonder about the costs to that, as we get closer to the election. Costs in terms of security policy, like say NATO and Europe, costs in terms of Taiwan, costs in terms of tariffs, which are extremely detrimental to the U.S. economy,\" he said, adding that investors will likely adopt a cautious wait-and-see approach for the time being.\n\nSome, he noted, might \"even actually rejoice to some extent in the likelihood of a Trump victory, because they may see this as a way of getting more shovelfuls of money pushed their way.\"\n\n\u2014 Ruxandra Iordache",

        "text": "How Harris and Trump differ on tech policy\nPresident Joe Biden\u2019s decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential campaign and endorse Vice President Kamala Harris upends the contest and alters its policy and strategic dynamics. It pits a younger Democrat against an older Republican, a woman of color campaigning against a white man, and a former prosecutor from California versus a New York/Florida billionaire.\n\nIn this blog, we compare how a President Harris and a re-elected President Trump would differ on major tech policy issues. In particular, we compare their views on Biden\u2019s artificial intelligence (AI) Executive Order, antitrust enforcement, taxes, racial/gender biases, cryptocurrency regulation, and digital equity. There is a vast gulf in how each leader would handle these pressing tech matters and what they would do to shape the future of digital technologies.\n\nBiden\u2019s AI Executive Order\n\nOne of the hallmarks of Biden\u2019s technology agenda was an ambitious executive order calling for greater public oversight and regulation of AI. AI is the transformative technology of our time, seeing implementation in virtually every sector. As such, President Biden issued an executive order, which called for every federal agency to examine the impacts of AI in its specific sector and the avenues for addressing its problems. He gave agencies several months to review their AI usage and oversight, with deliverables due sometime in December 2024.\n\nFormer President Trump\u2019s platform seeks to repeal the executive order, while a President Harris likely would keep it. In general, Trump supports a lighter regulatory touch on AI and other emerging technologies. In his initial term, very little news was generated around AI regulation.\n\nIn contrast, Harris understands the way AI is transforming communications and service delivery, and the need for public oversight. She likely would extend Biden\u2019s executive order and urge Congress to pass legislation that would codify greater protections to promote consumer privacy, cybersecurity, and human safety. She might also encourage the federal government to use its procurement power to make sure agencies provide appropriate guardrails for their AI use.\n\nAntitrust enforcement\n\nA President Harris would likely continue Biden\u2019s tough antitrust enforcement. She has talked repeatedly about the need to reduce inflation and improve economic opportunity for all Americans. The administration has gone after large platforms, which they feel have abused their strong market positions and engaged in predatory behavior that has harmed consumers and made it harder for people to buy necessary goods.\n\nTrump probably would not be as vigorous at anti-trust enforcement as Biden and Harris have been. He might continue current tech antitrust enforcement cases but would give a green light to tech mergers and acquisitions. His business background makes him generally more sympathetic to the business community, and he is unlikely to appoint strong enforcers to the Department of Justice, Federal Trade Commission, or Federal Communications Commission. That was the case in his first term as president and likely would continue if he wins another term as chief executive.\n\nTech billionaire taxes\n\nTrump has indicated he wants to extend his 2017 tax cuts when they expire in 2025 and cut income and corporate taxes even further. Even though a considerable amount of his earlier tax cuts went to rich individuals and wealthy corporations, his tax cut plans likely will continue those trends and push cuts in those directions.\n\nHarris likely will continue Biden\u2019s avoidance of income tax increases for those earning less than $400,000. But like President Biden, she wants to raise taxes on the ultra-wealthy on grounds they need to pay their fair share. Those tax increases would help pay for needed services for less-fortunate people.\n\nRacial/gender biases\n\nThere are well-documented racial and gender biases in AI that need to be taken seriously. Trump does not have a track record of supporting strong bias mitigation efforts, especially for racial bias, or of appointing regulators who take tough action in these areas. He has made many dubious claims in this area, most recently using the term \u201cBlack jobs\u201c in the last debate\u2014a term for which no one still has ascertained the meaning. In fact, he has been part of a swarm of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) critics that have condemned the use of race in college admissions on the grounds that such preferences no longer are warranted.\n\nHarris, in contrast, has a record of fighting racial and gender biases and supporting effective enforcement actions against those who violate basic rights. She has fought for anti-discrimination action in housing and wealth creation and has spoken clearly on the importance of effective government action. Her focus on these issues will likely continue as she forms a more pro-consumer, tech policy agenda.\n\nCryptocurrency regulation\n\nThe two candidates differ considerably regarding cryptocurrency regulation. Although Trump previously supported tough regulation against cryptocurrencies, he has recently moderated his position and advocated for a lighter approach. His view appears to be that crypto is an innovation that requires some time to work out and does not require tough oversight at this point.\n\nUnlike her Republican opponent, Harris has a tougher stance on cryptocurrency regulation. She thinks consumers need adequate protection and there should be greater transparency in the crypto marketplace. Administration appointments already have called for tougher U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) enforcement against cryptocurrency firms.\n\nDigital equity\n\nIn her new book, \u201cDigitally Invisible: How the Internet is Creating the New Underclass,\u201d Nicol Turner Lee argues that who gets into office often determines the scope of national tech policy, especially when it comes to the rewards for industry and communities. During his administration, Trump upended all of Obama\u2019s policies from data privacy to school connectivity, including those connecting the nation\u2019s schools to the internet. However, Trump did advance policies for more robust 5G wireless infrastructure, especially in rural communities.\n\nUnder the Biden-Harris administration, the largest allotment of funds has been allocated toward national broadband infrastructure under any administration, and federal agencies are steep into getting states the funds to launch their approved projects. If history is a dictate, Trump will halt all those programs and attempt to recoup the funds, while Harris would stay committed to bringing broadband to all communities.\n\nWith the election more than three months away, it\u2019s still too early to tell how each candidate will fare. But what is expected of Harris, assuming she secures the Democratic nomination, is that she will continue many of the tech policies of the Biden administration and stay that course as president if she were to win.",

The assassination attempt on former U.S. President and Republican nominee for this year\u2019s race Donald Trump reframed that half of the electoral race. The picture on the other side changed considerably with Biden\u2019s withdrawal from the race.\n\nWhile it remains to be seen if Harris prevails as the Democratic nominee, the presidential election remains a race of stark contrasts, leaving Canadians to wonder how their country will be affected by the results.\n\nWhat impact would a second Trump term have on Canada, America, and the globe?\n\nDuring Trump\u2019s previous four-year term, Canadian opinions of the United States declined considerably on a number of fronts. They were much less likely to describe the United States as \u201ca valuable friend and ally to Canada\u201d, \u201ca positive player in world affairs\u201d, or a \u201cprogressive society\u201d in 2020 than they were in 2016.\n\nRelated: Better with Biden? President-elect restores hope among Canadians for an improved relationship with U.S.\n\nLike all summer blockbusters, the 2024 sequel to 2016 is just as dramatic. With a potential second Trump term looming, Canadians are worried again. Majorities believe another four years of Trump will have negative effects on global peace and stability (68%), progress in reducing greenhouse gases (67%), America\u2019s unity (67%), the overall Canada-U.S. relationship (65%) and the Canadian economy (60%). On three of those factors \u2013 bringing America together, global peace, and fighting climate change \u2013 more than two-in-five Canadians believe a second Trump term will have \u201cvery negative\u201d impacts:\n\nThere is some disagreement across the political divide in this country on prospect for Trump retaking power. Few likely Liberal, NDP or Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois voters believe a Trump victory come November would have a positive effect on any of the factors canvassed.\n\nHowever, there is a sizable portion of the current CPC voting base who disagree. More than two-in-five of those who would vote CPC if an election were held today say they believe Trump\u2019s second term would have a positive impact on global stability. Approaching two-in-five (37%) say four more years of Trump would bring America closer together. There are also more than one-third (36%) of current CPC voters who believe Canada\u2019s relationship with the U.S. would benefit if Trump won the presidential election:\n\nA Trump win viewed as bad or terrible for Canada by most\n\nFewer than one-in-six (15%) Canadians would celebrate a Trump win in November\u2019s election as \u201cgood\u201d (9%) or \u201cexcellent\u201d (6%) news for Canada. Many more would call it \u201cterrible\u201d (38%) or \u201cbad\u201d (28%).\n\nLikely Liberal, NDP and BQ voters are much more likely to be in the latter group. Those who would vote CPC if an election were held today are more divided. Approaching two-in-five (37%) believe a new Trump administration would be \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cexcellent news\u201d for Canada, while nearly as many (34%) say it would \u201cbad\u201d or \u201cterrible\u201d:\n\nPart Two: Policy ramifications\n\nThe recently concluded Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisc. provided significant insight into the policy priorities of the Trump campaign. Many have been key talking points for Trump as he has travelled throughout the country and given speeches at rallies to his supporters.\n\nImmigration\n\nThe border and migrant crisis at America\u2019s southern border with Mexico has been a focal point for Trump and addressing it is a key pillar of the 2024 Republican Party Platform. Trump has said he plans to \u201cclose (the United States\u2019) borders\u201d and carry out a \u201cmass deportation\u201d that he says will be the largest such effort in American history.\n\nCanada would certainly be impacted by its southern neighbours\u2019 immigration policy, which could potentially lead to more asylum seekers heading further north. Three-quarters (74%) of Canadians say they would prefer Canada \u201ctake the necessary measures\u201d to prevent an influx of new refugees. One-quarter (26%) say instead Canada should welcome more migrants. Likely NDP voters are the only group of political supporters who prefer the latter at a majority level (53%):\n\nNATO spending\n\nDefence spending has become a pain point in the Canada-U.S. relationship even under Biden as Canada continues to underspend the two per cent of GDP it had agreed to as a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member. Trump will likely intensify that pain point, as he has said he would \u201cencourage (the Russians) to do whatever the hell they want\u201d with NATO members who fell short of their spending commitments. At the recent NATO conference in Washington, D.C., Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the country would reach the two per cent target by 2032 without detailing specifically how Canada would achieve that. It remains to be seen if this timeline would be enough to placate Trump.\n\nCanadians are divided evenly on whether a Trump win should accelerate Canada\u2019s defence spending plans.\n\nNotably, likely CPC voters are much more likely to believe Canada should accelerate its plan to hit the NATO defence spending target, which stands in contrast to Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre\u2019s statements on the issue. Poilievre would not commit to hitting the two per cent defence spending target if he were to become prime minister in comments made in the wake of the NATO conference earlier in July, saying Canada \u201cis broke\u201d and he needs to make sure any financial commitments he makes are properly costed.\n\nUkraine\n\nTrump and the Republican party\u2019s stance on the war in Ukraine also is a stark departure from the current administration\u2019s policies. Trump has vowed to end the war quickly if he wins in November, which potentially would involve suspending military aid to Kyiv unless it began peace negotiations with Russia. This could also set the battlelines as they are, which would likely involve Ukraine surrendering territory Russia has occupied.\n\nIf Trump were elected to a second term and he follows this path on Ukraine he has been signalling during the campaign, one-third (33%) of Canadians would want Canada to follow and urge Ukraine to negotiate for peace even if it meant surrendering territories. Two-thirds (67%) would prefer Canada continue to strongly support the Ukraine if the Americans stopped military aid, even if it meant Canada providing more financial support to help make up the gap.\n\nThe Canadian political divide that has been evident on the Ukraine war in recent months is also on display here. Overwhelming majorities of likely Liberal, NDP and BQ voters prefer Canada to continue supporting and even boost aid to Ukraine in the wake of a Trump withdrawal. CPC supporters are more divided:\n\nSupply Management\n\nCanada\u2019s system of supply management, which protects Canada\u2019s dairy, poultry and eggs industries through production and import controls and pricing mechanisms, proved to be a major sticking point when Canada sat down at the table with Mexico and the United States to draft the replacement agreement for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) under the previous Trump administration. To pass the replacement deal, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA or CUSMA), Canada agreed to open up a percentage of its market to American dairy, a move which was heavily criticized by Canada\u2019s dairy farmers.\n\nRelated:\n\nUSMCA is up for review in 2026, which means the next president of the U.S. will have a significant influence on how the negotiations will proceed. Biden\u2019s top trade official has warned that the U.S. will push for changes, signalling it could be a contentious negotiation regardless of whether the Democratic nominee or Trump win the election in the fall.\n\nCanadians lean towards protecting supply management in these upcoming negotiations, but 45 per cent prefer Canada making some sacrifices of the supply management system if it means smoother negotiations with our North American partners. Likely CPC voters are the only group of political supporters to hold the latter as a majority opinion (62%):\n\nKeystone XL\n\nOne of Biden\u2019s first acts when he took office in 2021 was to kill Keystone XL, a controversial pipeline project which lingered for years in limbo before Trump signed a presidential memorandum to build it in 2017. The project may get another look if Trump is re-elected as president. Notably, TC Energy, formerly TransCanada Corporation, the project\u2019s owner, was a sponsor of the recent Republican National Convention.\n\nCanadians are more likely to believe Keystone XL\u2019s revival would be a good thing (46%) than a bad one (34%). Those in Alberta (67%) and Saskatchewan (64%) are more likely to cheer the return of Keystone XL, while only those in Quebec are more likely to think it would be a bad thing (46%) than a good one (29%):\n\nPart Three: Canadian political angles\n\nPoilievre trusted more than Trudeau to handle trade, but low confidence overall\n\nCanada\u2019s own near-term political future is murky. An election must take place by October 2025 and Canada\u2019s incumbent minority government is trailing badly in current vote intentions.\n\nCanadians are more likely to say Poilievre (32%) would get a stronger new trade deal than the incumbent Trudeau (20%), but there is little confidence in either leader. As many say neither is a good option on this front (32%) as select Poilievre.\n\nThe Conservative leader outperforms Trudeau greatly among men older than 34, while women are near evenly split between both party leaders and believe neither is a good choice at a plurality level:\n\nWould Trump win change voters\u2019 decision in Canada?\n\nA second Trump term evidently presents both a potential sea change in policy south of the border, as well as challenge for Canada\u2019s relationship with its neighbour, regardless of who is prime minister. The sense among a plurality of Canadians is that a second Trump term would not affect their vote (see detailed tables). However, there is some movement among those whose support is more \u201csoft\u201d than \u201cfirm\u201d, i.e. those who are not fully committed to their current vote intention.\n\nSoft NDP supporters are more likely than not to say they could support the Liberals in the event Trump wins re-election. For most non-fully committed voters, it appears a second Trump term would further entrench their current leanings:",

Protection more than one year prior to the general election should only be granted in extraordinary, case by case circumstances in consultation with the committee, based on threat assessment and other factors.\n\nCriteria have been established to assist the DHS Secretary and the advisory committee in their decision making (as of 2017).\n\nWhen determining whether a candidate for the Office of President or Vice President of the United States qualifies as a major candidate, the Secretary has broad discretion and may consider a variety of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\nWhether the candidate has publicly announced his or her candidacy and has filed the appropriate documentation with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and is in compliance with the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended, and related laws; Whether the candidate is actively campaigning on a national basis for the office for which his or her candidacy has been announced, as demonstrated by operating a national campaign apparatus, regularly appearing at public events in multiple states, producing and publishing campaign advertisements, and other similar indicia of a campaign; A threat assessment conducted by the Secret Service of general or specific threats directed towards the candidate (for these purposes, \u201cthreats\u201d should be defined as explicit threats of bodily harm to the candidate or indications of inappropriate behavior towards the candidate suggesting potential bodily harm); Whether, during and within an active and competitive major party primary, the most recent average of established national polls, as reflected by the Real Clear Politics National Average or similar mechanism, the candidate is polling at 15% or more for 30 consecutive days; Whether the candidate is the formal or de facto nominee of a major party for President or Vice President; Whether the candidate is an independent or third-party candidate for President polling at 20% or more of the Real Clear Politics National Average for 30 consecutive days; Whether the candidate is the Vice Presidential running mate of the above independent or third-party candidate.\n\nTitle 18 U.S.C.' 3056(a)(7) states that the U.S. Secret Service is also authorized to protect spouses of major Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates, as identified by the DHS Secretary, within 120 days of the general Presidential election. Some candidates have received protection earlier in the campaign pursuant to Presidential memoranda.\n\nWhat is the history of candidate/nominee protection?\n\nCandidate and nominee protection was expanded to include major candidates for President and Vice President in 1968:\n\nMajor candidates and their spouses began receiving protection after the assassination of Robert Kennedy in 1968. PL-90-331 was passed June 6, 1968. (Language since adopted into 3056);\n\nPrior to this event, candidates and their families did not receive Secret Service protection;\n\nProtection of a candidate/nominee is designed to maintain the integrity of the democratic process and continuity of Government.\n\nMedia",

        "text": "US economy picks up amid heated presidential campaign\nUS economy picks up amid heated presidential campaign\n\nGetty Images\n\nEconomic growth picked up in the US this spring, raising hopes that the world's largest economy will be able to get inflation under control while avoiding a painful slowdown. The economy expanded at an annual rate of 2.8% over the three months to June, lifted by brisk consumer spending, the Commerce Department said Thursday. The pace was faster than expected, but still marked a slowdown from 2023. The strong figures arrive during a heated presidential campaign, in which voters have regularly named the economy as their top concern.\n\nThe country's steady growth - far outstripping its international peers - would usually typically favour Democrats as the incumbent party. But the current mix of conditions has made for a puzzle. Unemployment, at 4.1%, is low but rising. Growth is solid, but has slowed from the boom that came as the economy reopened after Covid. And though price inflation has significantly subsided, economic discontent remains elevated, as households grapple with a 20% leap in prices since 2021 and high borrowing costs. President Joe Biden's decision to drop out of the race has scrambled the picture further. \"There's a lot of crosscurrents here, in terms of voters thinking about the economy,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. \"At this point, I don't think it's a headwind or a tailwind.\"\n\nForecasters had been predicting growth this quarter of about 2%. But Thursday's figures showed the economy bouncing back from a slowdown at the start of the year, when gross domestic product (GDP) grew just 1.4%. As well as strong consumer spending, the report showed increased business investment and an uptick in exports. In a statement, Mr Biden said the report \"makes clear we now have the strongest economy in the world\". But University of Iowa professor Michael Lewis-Beck, who is known for a model that predicts popular vote outcomes based on economic growth and presidential approval, said growth did not appear to have been strong enough in the first half of this year to overcome Mr Biden's steep unpopularity. His model had predicted a narrow loss for Mr Biden based on the start of the year growth. He warned that Democrats would face even stiffer odds now that the president is off the ballot, as they lose any incumbent advantage. The election remains close and complicated, he added, noting that the three elections since 1948 that his model has been wrong - in 1960, 1968 and 1976 - took place in \"turbulent times\", like today's. \"Not that the economy wasn't relevant in those times, but there were other huge things going on,\" he said, describing the current race as a \"nail biter\".\n\nSome other analysts said they thought Mr Biden's decision to quit the race could make it easier for Democrats to pick the parts of his legacy they want to promote, while separating themselves from negatives such as inflation. \"I see upside with vice president [Kamala] Harris taking over the ticket because she can put distance between herself and President Biden\" on inflation, said Danielle Deiseroth, executive director of the progressive pollster Data for Progress. The administration's signature economic policies - including investments in roads, bridges, advanced technology and clean energy - are otherwise popular, she noted. \"It's an opportunity for a reset on the economic narrative,\" she said.\n\nUntil Mr Biden bowed out, Mr Zandi said he had been \"very uncomfortable\" with the Democratic victory that his firm has been forecasting for the presidential election, using a model that takes into account things like gas prices and unemployment rates. Now, he said he felt better \"sticking with the model\". \"I think it's a game-changer politically,\" he said of Mr Biden's move, while noting that small changes to non-economic factors such as turnout could \"easily\" deliver a win to Trump. \"It's going to be very close,\" he said. \"It's very much on a razor's edge.\"",

        "text": "July 25, 2024, presidential campaign news\nVice President Kamala Harris speaks at a campaign rally in West Allis, Wisconsin, on July 23. Jim Vondruska/Getty Images\n\nThe likely 2024 presidential election campaign between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump begins with no clear leader, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS.\n\nTrump holds 49% support among registered voters nationwide to Harris\u2019 46%, a finding within the poll\u2019s margin of sampling error. That\u2019s a closer contest than earlier CNN polling this year had found on the matchup between Biden and Trump.\n\nThe survey finds voters widely supportive of both Biden\u2019s decision to step aside and his choice to remain in office through the end of his term. Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters are broadly enthusiastic about Harris and willing to coalesce around her as the new presumptive nominee, even as they remain deeply divided on whether Biden\u2019s Democratic successor should seek to continue his policies or chart a new course.\n\nThe poll, conducted online July 22 and 23, surveyed registered voters who had previously participated in CNN surveys in April or June, both of which found Trump leading Biden by 6 points in a head-to-head matchup. Checking back in with the same people means that shifts in preferences are more likely to reflect real changes over time and not just statistical noise.\n\nAnd the new poll finds some critical movement in these early days of a Harris-Trump race.\n\nHarris hangs on to 95% of those who earlier said they supported Biden, while Trump retains the support of a slightly smaller 92% of his previous backers. Those who previously said they would support neither Biden nor Trump in a two-way matchup now split 30% for Harris and 27% for Trump, with the rest saying they\u2019d vote for someone else or opt out of this year\u2019s election.\n\nHalf of those who back Harris in the new poll (50%) say their vote is more in support of her than against Trump. That\u2019s a dramatic shift compared with the Trump-focused dynamic of the Biden-Trump race. Among Biden\u2019s supporters in CNN\u2019s June poll, just 37% said their vote was mainly to express support for the president.\n\nAbout three-quarters of Trump\u2019s supporters (74%) say their vote is to express support for him rather than opposition to Harris. That\u2019s an increase in affirmative support for him compared with the June CNN poll (66%), which came before an assassination attempt on Trump\u2019s life and the Republican National Convention at which the former president formally accepted his party\u2019s nomination.\n\nThe poll finds Trump\u2019s favorability rating ticking up to 43%, higher than it\u2019s been since 2020 in CNN polling.\n\nRead more about the new CNN poll.",

        "text": "The Role of Health Care in the New Presidential Election\nThere is no Clinton health reform plan or (then) controversial Obamacare plan to command the attention of voters in this presidential election. Former President Trump will focus on other issues he views as advantageous\u2014not health care\u2014and Vice President Harris is unlikely to make new health proposals of her own. Nevertheless, health is likely to be a consequential factor in the campaign. Here\u2019s how.\n\nFirst and foremost, it will be a campaign weapon for the vice president. That starts (and has already started) with abortion and reproductive rights. Vice President Harris will try to rally the Democratic base and appeal to younger voters and women, arguing that former President Trump will sign a national ban on abortion and has selected a running mate with extreme views on women and reproductive freedom. This is not news, but it is the main role health will play in the presidential election.\n\nFrom there, expect Vice President Harris to attempt to tie former President Trump to a long list of proposals made by various conservative groups that support him to roll back public programs and insurance coverage. These include plans that would dilute protections for pre-existing conditions, let enhanced ACA subsidies lapse, transform Medicare into a voucher-like program, place a time limit on Medicaid eligibility, and severely cut and cap Medicaid and hand it off to the states. How far Vice President Harris goes down this list remains to be seen, and which items on the list are emphasized may depend on which audiences she is engaging. Her selection for vice president could also influence these choices. These policy ideas may have some appeal to the conservative Republican base, but polling shows they are unpopular with the general public. Many of these issues could have traction down ballot as well, but that\u2019s a different subject for another day.\n\nFormer President Trump and Republicans have their own issues on which they have similar advantages, including immigration and inflation, and they are already pushing them. (This is a political analysis, and no judgement is intended here about the merits of claims made by either side, or the techniques used to make them).\n\nThe Democratic advantage on health is about the same size as the Republican advantage on immigration. We won\u2019t know for some time what the picture looks like with Vice President Harris at the top of the ticket. Voter trust in the Democratic candidate to handle health care issues could grow or shrink. The same is true for former President Trump\u2019s advantage on other issues now that he has a new opponent.\n\nSubstantive health policy platforms do matter in the election, but more for signaling than substance. The voters don\u2019t usually digest the details of policy plans, they hear the candidate\u2019s concern for the problem and for them. No doubt Vice President Harris will talk about the Biden-Harris record on health care during the campaign, featuring several policy achievements, including Medicare drug price negotiations (first prices are due in late August or early September); capping the cost of insulin at $35 a month for Medicare beneficiaries; the Medicare cap on out-of-pocket costs; enhancing ACA subsidies through 2025 to make coverage more affordable for many enrollees; and eliminating medical debt from credit reports.\n\nAll of these policies have two common attributes: voters can understand them and talking about them sends a signal: \u201cI am the candidate who cares about your health care costs.\u201d These policies only reach very targeted groups, and most voters don\u2019t actually feel their impact, but for Vice President Harris and Democrats, they are a way to show voters they care about their economic worries\u2014the critical issue area where former President Trump and Republicans otherwise have an advantage. When we asked voters who said they were most concerned about the economy what they meant by that in our polls, health care costs were near the top of the list, trailing inflation by just a few percentage points and well ahead of gas prices and every other economic worry. Politically, focusing on health care costs isn\u2019t about health care, it\u2019s a partial answer for Democrats to the advantage Republicans currently have on inflation and the economy.\n\nPresumably, Vice President Harris will also pick up on a number of Biden-Harris policy proposals, including increasing the number of drugs subject to negotiation, extending the insulin cost cap and the out-of-pocket cost cap beyond Medicare, and extending the enhanced ACA subsidies. It\u2019s always a plus politically to talk about addressing people\u2019s health care costs in concrete ways. The downside is alerting voters who were not previously aware that these policies reached narrower populations to begin with.\n\nPolicy proposals made in elections are often more about signaling than details and substance. The media dissects them. Stakeholders react to them. But for all except the most engaged voters, they are mostly signals of what candidates care about and ways for voters to locate candidates on the ideological spectrum. More for big government. Or more for smaller government. And so forth. Legislation is a different matter. Laws affect people\u2019s real lives and elected officials are held accountable for them.\n\nFinally, it would be surprising politically if Vice President Harris made significant new health proposals of her own during the campaign. She has the Biden-Harris health care record to run on and can play offense on health care and build on an established advantage on abortion and health generally. As she learned when she made an ill-fated Medicare for All proposal with a Medicare Advantage option as a candidate in a Democratic primary, putting out your own proposal puts you on defense and gives your opponent a target to shoot at. It can alienate groups who support you, who may want you to do more, or less, or something different.\n\nPlaying offense on abortion and health and signaling concern about kitchen table worries to voters are the most important roles health will play in the presidential election. Policy platforms and plans will matter far less this time.",

Kennedy Jr., Harris led Trump 42% to 38%, an advantage outside the margin of error. Kennedy, favored by 8% of voters in the poll, has yet to qualify for the ballot in many states ahead of the Nov. 5 election.The poll, which was conducted online, surveyed 1,241 U.S. adults nationwide, including 1,018 registered voters.A1.

        "text": "Joe Biden explains decision to end 2024 campaign, \u201cpass the torch\u201d to Kamala Harris\nU.S. President Joe Biden on July 24 delivered a solemn call to voters to defend the country\u2019s democracy as he laid out in an Oval Office address his decision to drop his 2024 presidential campaign and throw his support behind Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nInsisting that \u201cthe defense of democracy is more important than any title,\u201d Mr. Biden used his first public address since his announcement Sunday that he was stepping aside to deliver an implicit repudiation of former President Donald Trump. He did not directly call out Trump, whom he has called an existential threat to democracy. The 10-minute address also gave Mr. Biden a chance to try to shape how history will remember his one and only term in office.\n\n\u201cNothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cAnd that includes personal ambition.\u201d It was a moment for the history books \u2014 a U.S. President reflecting before the nation on why he was taking the rare step of voluntarily handing off power. It hasn\u2019t been done since 1968, when Lyndon Johnson announced he would not seek reelection in the heat of the Vietnam War.\n\n\u201cI revere this office,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cBut I love my country more.\u201d Trump, just an hour earlier at a campaign rally, revived his baseless claims of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Mr. Biden. His refusal to concede inspired the Capitol insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021, which Mr. Biden called \u201cthe worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.\u201d Mr. Biden skirted the political reality that brought him to that point: His abysmal performance in a debate against Trump nearly a month ago, where he spoke haltingly, appeared ashen and failed to rebut his predecessor\u2019s attacks, sparked a crisis of confidence from Democrats. Lawmakers and ordinary voters questioned not just whether he was capable of beating Trump in November, but also whether, at 81, he was still fit for the high-pressure job.\n\nMr. Biden tried to outlast the skepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to step aside only mounted from the party\u2019s political elites and from ordinary voters.\n\n\u201cI have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\u201d Mr. Biden said, saying he wanted to make room for \u201cfresh voices, yes, younger voices.\u201d He added, \u201cThat is the best way to unite our nation.\u201d It was a belated fulfillment of his 2020 pledge to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders \u2014 and a bow to the drumbeat of calls from within his party to step aside.\n\nMr. Biden\u2019s address was carried live by the major broadcast and cable news networks. He spooled out an weighty to-do list for his last six months in office, pledging to remain focused on being president until his term expires at noon on Jan. 20, 2025. He said he would work to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, fight to boost government support to cure cancer and push for Supreme Court reform, among other things.\n\nThe President sought to use the address to outline the stakes in the election, which both Biden and Harris have framed as a choice between freedom and chaos, but he tried to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office.\n\n\u201cThe great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cThe people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America \u2014 lies in your hands.\u201d Mr. Biden was also making the case for his legacy of sweeping domestic legislation and the renewal of alliances abroad. But the way history will remember his time in office and his historic decision to step aside is intertwined with Harris\u2019 electoral result in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nHis advisers say he intends to hold campaign events and fundraisers benefiting Ms. Harris, whom Mr. Biden praised as \u201ctough\u201d and \u201ccapable,\u201d albeit at a far slower pace than if he had remained on the ballot himself.\n\nMs. Harris advisers will ultimately have to decide how to deploy the President, whose popularity sagged as voters in both parties questioned his fitness for office.\n\nMr. Biden, aides say, knows that if Harris loses, he\u2019ll be criticized for staying in the race too long and not giving her or another Democrat time to effectively mount a campaign against Trump. If she wins, she\u2019ll ensure his policy victories are secured and expanded, and he\u2019ll be remembered for a Washingtonian decision to step aside for the next generation of leadership.\n\nMr. Biden said he\u2019s grateful to have served as President \u2014 nowhere else would a kid with a stutter grow up to sit in the Oval Office.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve given my heart and my soul to our nation,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been blessed a million times in return.\u201d Press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that any question of Mr. Biden resigning his office before the election \u2014 which would allow Harris to run as an incumbent \u2014 was \u201cridiculous.\u201d Jean-Pierre said Mr. Biden has \u201cno regrets\u201d about his decision to stay in the race as long as he did, or his decision to quit it over the weekend. She said Mr. Biden\u2019s decision had nothing to do with his health.",

        "text": "Howard University Releases Guidance on Political Activity during the Presidential Elections\nAs the upcoming presidential election cycle moves into full swing, Howard University has released mandatory guidance on political activity that all faculty, students, and constituent organizations are required to follow.\n\nDear Howard University Community,\n\nHoward University like all universities, provides a natural forum for political discourse and activity. Moreover, Howard\u2019s commitment to the \u201cdiscovery of solutions to human problems in the United States and throughout the world\u201d is in its mission, and the University\u2019s essence is expressed in its core values of Excellence, Leadership, Service and Truth.\n\nGiven the global attention to the historic potential nomination of Howard University alumna Vice President Kamala Harris (B.A. \u201986) as the Democratic presidential candidate, the Howard University community needs important guidance to avoid any inadvertent attribution of political campaign activity to the University. A violation of the political campaign prohibition, whether intentional or unintentional, could have significant consequences that would jeopardize the financial future of the University. We ask that all members of the University community be aware of the following general guidance, which is taken from the Howard University Policy #800-002 Political Activity Guidance to All Key Stakeholders Policy (PDF). For more information, please review this Howard University policy.\n\nTo protect Howard University\u2019s legacy and its status as a non-profit 501(c)(3) tax-exempt educational institution, it is incumbent upon all students, faculty, staff, and alumni to comply fully with University policies and procedures.\n\nThe most important point to remember is that the University and its constituent organizations are prohibited from engaging in partisan political activity. This includes:\n\nmaking financial contributions to a campaign;\n\nsoliciting campaign contributions (fundraising);\n\ndistributing information or creating websites and links in favor of or in opposition to a certain candidate;\n\nsponsoring events to promote a certain candidate;\n\nengaging in disparate treatment of candidates invited to participate at a University event; and\n\nestablishing political action committees (PACs).\n\nThis policy is not intended in any way to abridge freedom of expression, academic freedoms, or imply that individuals cannot exercise their constitutional political and civic rights. Should you engage in partisan political activity, you must always make it clear that your personal views or opinions do not represent those of Howard University and that your partisan political activities are not sponsored or supported by Howard University in any way.\n\nThe next section includes two (2) disclaimers for your convenience.\n\nDisclaimers: Public Statements (Oral or Written) by Key Stakeholders\n\nKey Stakeholders may not make partisan political statements (oral or written) when speaking as a representative of Howard University, at official Howard University functions, or in official Howard University publications.\n\nPersonal public statements in support of a candidate or political party are permitted where there is a clear indication that comments are entirely personal and do not, and are not intended to, reflect or represent the views of Howard University and an appropriate disclaimer is used.\n\nFor all oral personal public statements regarding a candidate \u2013 the speaker should personally state:\n\n\u201cOpinions expressed are the personal opinions of [Name] and not the opinions of Howard University, a tax-exempt educational institution.\u201d\n\nFor all written personal statements or appearances where an official is referred to by name and title \u2013 the statement should include:\n\n\u201cTitles and affiliations of each individual are provided for identification purposes only. Opinions expressed are the personal opinions of [Name] and not the opinions of Howard University, a tax-exempt educational institution.\u201d\n\nPlease also note that Howard University Resources are not to be used, even when using the Disclaimer. Howard University Resources include, but are not limited to:\n\nHoward University images, campus statuary and landmarks, logos, insignia, or marks. This includes images of the Clock Tower, University seal, Bison logo, and other trademarked intellectual property,\n\nHoward University printed or digital letterheads or stationery,\n\nHoward University building and email addresses,\n\nindoor and outdoor campus spaces, including The Yard, offices, meeting rooms, and so forth,\n\noffice equipment, such as computers, phones, and copiers, and office supplies,\n\nHoward personnel, including administrative staff and other Howard employees,\n\nemail, campus mail, and voicemail systems,\n\nHoward University social media, and other platforms sponsored by the University, such as Zoom and Teams; websites, and blogs. University print and digital publications,\n\nbulk mail privileges and sales tax exemptions,\n\npaper and electronic mailing lists, including directories, listservs, donor rolls and databases,\n\nfood and refreshments.\n\nOutside of the University, individuals can express their own personal opinions and make direct personal contributions to a campaign. Anytime your action might implicate the University, please stop and think about it and consider these rules.\n\nFinally, please take note that any invitations extended to dignitaries must comply with Howard University Policy #400-002 Policy for Inviting Dignitaries to HU.\n\nSince 1867, Howard has fostered leadership to address issues borne from injustice, discrimination, and disparity, to effect positive social, economic, and political change, particularly for African Americans and other people of color, through scholarship and activism.\n\nWe hope that you will join in protecting the important legacy of Howard University by following this important guidance.\n\nThank you.\n\nIn Truth and Service",

Who among the Democrats will take his place and receive a presidential nomination. While the party will soon hold its national convention in August, Vice-President Kamala Harris has emerged as the favorite. Polymarket which is a prediction market place has a different name that is making the rounds.The prediction market has revealed that people are increasingly betting on former First Lady Michelle Obama . She is quickly emerging as a favorite. The political scenario in the US is rapidly changing and Michelle\u2019s entry may be considered a \u2018wild card\u2019 entry.Data from the prediction market which has attracted bets worth more than $214 million has given Obama a 11% chance of replacing Joe Biden on the ballot box. Kamala Harris remains the favorite with the former first lady securing the second position. It has been reported that $24 million has been traded on the prospects of the former first lady emerging as a favorite to replace Biden.Within a period of 24 hours, the chances of Michelle Obama moved up from 3% to 10% indicating that the party may be considering her candidature.The former first lady has preferred to stay away from political events and has actually stated that she is not interested in pursuing a career in electoral politics. She has supported Joe Biden and called on Americans to unite and defeat Donald Trump She has attacked Donald Trump in the past and said that the country will suffer, if he is elected as the president for a second term. There are also indications that former President Barack Obama is working behind the scenes in support of his wife. He is hoping that during the party\u2019s national convention, Michelle Obama is issued a presidential nomination.US President Joe Biden has resigned voluntarily. The rules are clear that another candidate can replace him on the ballot box. However, the delegates who had voted for Biden are now free to make independent choices and this means that Kamala Harris will need to work on convincing them.Each term of the US President is for a period of four years. Presently, they can serve for only two terms. The 22Amendment of the US Constitution restricted the term of the president to only two terms. It was passed in 1947.",

        "text": "Paris 2024: Geopolitics and the Olympics \u2014 USC News\nWhen French historian and educator Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the modern Olympics in 1894, he did so with a vision of promoting peace through sport. In reality, the Olympics have often reflected the geopolitics of the period.\n\nTensions flared Wednesday when Olympic officials moved to crush U.S. probes into a Chinese doping scandal. Multiple wars rage, political instability is shaking France and anxiety mounts about the U.S. presidential election. Can Olympic victories translate into geopolitical wins?\n\n\u201cInternational sporting events have become thoroughly politicized, and given the chaos around the globe, we can expect many acts of protest and disruption both inside and outside the stadiums of Paris,\u201d said Robert English, an associate professor of international relations, Slavic languages and literature and environmental studies at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences.\n\n\u201cWe live in an era in which reputation is central to the security of nations. A mega-event like the Olympics becomes a key platform to the host and participants alike,\u201d said Nicholas Cull, a historian and expert in public diplomacy, foreign policy and media at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. \u201cInternational actors compete to showcase their own strengths and reveal the weaknesses of their adversaries, real or imagined.\u201d\n\nGeopolitics and the Olympics: Games are apolitical in theory, but not in practice\n\nThough the International Olympic Committee maintains a strong position against the politicization of sport in its Olympic Charter, reality often intrudes.\n\n\u201cIn the world we have, we know that the Olympics are political. The U.S. boycotted the 1980 Moscow Olympics because of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and earlier, in 1968, two Black American runners raised their fists in a Black power salute on the winners\u2019 podium,\u201d said Gregory Treverton, a professor of the practice of international relations and spatial sciences at USC Dornsife.\n\nTreverton, who served as chairman of the U.S. National Intelligence Council from 2014 to 2017 and previously worked for the first Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, where he handled Europe for the National Security Council, said that the main benefit of the Olympics from a political perspective is probably the athletes themselves, as they get to know their counterparts from other countries.\n\nAs athletes interact, they participate in a unique cultural exchange that only an event like the Olympics can provide, experts say.\n\nGeopolitics and the Olympics: Games a platform for public diplomacy?\n\nCull, a professor of communication at USC Annenberg, said he\u2019ll be watching athletes from smaller, lesser-known countries whose potential Olympic victories could have broader political ramifications.\n\nHe notes that Kosovo\u2019s 2016 Olympic success in women\u2019s judo was a \u201cmassive deal,\u201d which bolstered the nation\u2019s argument to be recognized as a nation in its own right rather than a runaway province of neighbor Serbia.\n\nExperts predict news headlines to center on the performances of U.S., Chinese and Russian athletes. Competitors from Russia and its ally, Belarus, will participate as Individual Neutral Athletes, without national flags or anthems, and will be excluded from the official medal table.\n\n\u201cRussia is effectively banned from the 2024 Summer Olympics because of its war in Ukraine. Ideally, this ban would work as another sanction to pressure Russia to stop the war,\u201d English said. \u201cPractically, it will have zero such effect and mainly serves to further alienate ordinary Russians from the West.\u201d\n\nUSC Professor Jonathan Aronson warned that the high-profile nature of the Olympics brings with it the potential for demonstrations or acts of violence, a Russian attack in Ukraine aimed at distracting global attention, efforts by right-wing French or European Union factions to undermine President Emmanuel Macron, road closures and travel disruptions, or a major cyberattack that could disrupt events.\n\n\u201cIf the Olympics proceed without significant disruptions, it will be considered a major success and a huge relief for the organizers,\u201d said Aronson, a professor of communication at USC Annenberg and a professor of political science and international relations at USC Dornsife.\n\nThe expert in international relations, communications, globalization and trade negotiations added: \u201cWhile there will be many touching personal stories during the Olympics, it is unrealistic to expect a widespread moment of public diplomacy or a unifying atmosphere.\u201d",

        "text": "\u2018We choose freedom\u2019: Kamala Harris campaign launches first ad\nThe Harris for President campaign has launched its first official video, less than a week after US President Joe Biden announced he was dropping out of the race and his vice-president Kamala Harris said she was running for the nomination.\n\nThe ad caps a week during which Harris also broke funding records and quickly clinched enough delegate support to become the presumptive nominee in an election that is now just over 100 days away.\n\nReleased on Thursday morning, the ad opens with shots of Harris\u2019s smiling face behind a podium, the word Kamala, the word Harris, and the American flag. The soundtrack is the beginning of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s song Freedom, to which Harris entered and exited her first speech to campaign staffers after gaining lightning speed momentum on the road to becoming the presumptive nominee.\n\nThe ad is narrated by Harris, whose first words are, \u201cIn this election we each face a question. What kind of country do we want to live in?\u201d\n\nShe continues: \u201cThere are some people who think we should be a country of chaos. Of fear. Of hate,\u201d she says, over shots of Trump and JD Vance. \u201cBut us, we choose something different.\u201d\n\nThe voiceover pauses for a crowd chanting, \u201cKamala! Kamala! Kamala!\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen A still from Kamala Harris\u2019 first campaign video. Photograph: Supplied\n\n\u201cWe choose freedom,\u201d she says. And Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s booming chorus starts: \u201cFreedom, freedom, I can\u2019t move. Freedom cut me loose. Freedom, freedom where are you, cause I need freedom too.\u201d\n\nHarris continues: \u201cThe freedom not just to get by, but to get ahead. The freedom to be safe from gun violence. The freedom to make decisions about your own body. We choose a future where no child lives in poverty. Where we can all afford healthcare. Where no one is above the law\u201d.\n\nThe last sentence appears as the screen shows images of front page after front page with headlines containing the words \u201cGuilty\u201d, or \u201cIndicted\u201d, \u201cConvicted\u201d, referring to Trump. There is also an image of Stormy Daniels.\n\n\u201cWe believe in the promise of America and we\u2019re ready to fight for it. Because when we fight. We win,\u201d Harris continues.\n\n\u201cSo join us. Go to Kamalaharris.com and let\u2019s get to work,\u201d she ends, as Beyonc\u00e9 sings: \u201cI\u2019ma keep running \u2019cause a winner don\u2019t quit on themselves.\u201d\n\nThe ad goes hard on optimism. Harris does not talk about her record as a prosecutor. The people shown are voters at rallies, at home, at work or at the doctor. There is a closeup of a woman in a lab coat embroidered with the word, \u201cObstetrics\u201d, a reference to Harris\u2019 strong stance on abortion rights. Almost everyone in the ad is smiling or laughing. They holding up placards saying Kamala and wave the New Progress pride flag.\n\nIt ends with Harris walking in a light, bright blue suit and applauding. Absent are the mentions of coconuts falling from trees, the context, Brat and the venn diagram that have done so much to turn Harris from awkward to cool on social media.\n\nThe messaging is a sharp departure from the 2020 campaign video that re-circulated online in the hours after Biden\u2019s resignation. Throughout that ad, a Law & Order SVU-like deep male voice directly compares Harris and Trump, beginning, \u201cHe\u2019s a world leader in temper tantrums. She never loses her cool. She prosecuted sex predators. He is one.\u201d It ends by calling Harris the \u201canti-Trump\u201d.\n\nBefore the ad aired, Beyonc\u00e9 was reported to have given Harris permission to use the song. While the singer has not explicitly endorsed Harris, the song permission will be viewed as tacit endorsement. Beyonc\u00e9 has long lent her support to the Democrats. She performed at Obama\u2019s second inauguration, in support of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, and endorsed the 2020 Biden-Harris ticket.\n\nThe song features Pulitzer-winning rapper Kendrick Lamar and samples a lining hymn \u2013 part of the Black church tradition of unaccompanied call-and response singing \u2013 and a song performed by a prisoner at Mississippi State Penitentiary, the notorious prison labor farm famed for its musical history, in 1947.",

        "text": "Harris Narrows Gap Against Trump, Times/Siena Poll Finds\nVice President Kamala Harris begins a 103-day sprint for the presidency in a virtual tie with former President Donald J. Trump, according to the latest New York Times/Siena College poll, as her fresh candidacy was quickly reuniting a Democratic Party that had been deeply fractured over President Biden.\n\nJust days after the president abandoned his campaign under pressure from party leaders, the poll showed Democrats rallying behind Ms. Harris as the presumptive nominee, with only 14 percent saying they would prefer another option. An overwhelming 70 percent of Democratic voters said they wanted the party to speedily consolidate behind her rather than engage in a more competitive and drawn-out process.\n\n[The poll is full of findings unlike any we\u2019ve seen this cycle, with the exception of who leads the presidential race, Nate Cohn writes.]\n\nHer swift reassembling of the Democratic coalition appeared to help narrow Mr. Trump\u2019s significant advantage over Mr. Biden of only a few weeks ago. Ms. Harris was receiving 93 percent support from Democrats, the same share that Mr. Trump was getting from Republicans.",

However, in his post, the former president did not mention anything about endorsing Kamala Harris.\n\nTaking to X, he wrote, \u201cThe sacred cause of this country is larger than any one of us.\" Joe Biden has stayed true to these words again and again over a lifetime of service to the American people. Thank you, @POTUS.\u201d\n\nAlso Read | Trump Shooter Researched Lee Harvey Oswald, FBI Head Testifies\n\nEarlier, a source close to the Biden family told New York Post that Obama has not endorsed Kamala Harris, as he believes she cannot defeat Republican nominee Donald Trump in the upcoming 2024 Presidential Election. \u201cObama\u2019s very upset because he knows she can\u2019t win,\u201d source told New York Post.\n\nAlso Read | A Key Netanyahu Coalition Partner Says Trump Best for Israel\n\nToday, while addressing the nation, US President Joe Biden said that he is \"passing the torch to a new generation,\" as he explained why he stepped back from the 2024 US presidential race to America for the first time on Wednesday in Washington. \u201cI revere this office. But I love my country more. I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That is the best way to unite our nation.\u201d\n\nAlso Read | Donald Trump shooter\u2019s father speaks 1st time after shooting incident\n\nMeanwhile, Harris has not been declared as the presidential candidate by the Democratic Party. She was endorsed by US President Joe Biden, as the presidential nominee for the Democratic Party while he announced his decision to step out of the Presidential race. However, an AP survey revealed that Harris has won former speaker Nancy Pelosi among other party members support. The survey revealed that on Monday, several state delegations, including Texas and California (Kamla Harris's home state), affirmed their backing for Harris. By the end of the day, Harris had secured support from more than the 1,976 Democrat delegates required to secure victory on the first ballot, as reported by the AP. No other candidate received support from the delegates contacted.",

        "text": "Is German government prepared for a possible Trump US election victory?\nWith less than four months until the US presidential election, the government in Berlin is preparing for the possibility of a Trump victory. How could his return impact Germany and the EU?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile Donald Trump's election in 2016 surprised much of the world, this time, Europe \u2014 and Germany in particular \u2014 is already preparing for the possibility of a major shift in policy in Washington this November.\n\n\"Ultimately, it is a difficult situation to remain partners with such a difficult administration as under Trump. Germany has shown that it can somehow work, as it did last time when Trump was president,\" political scientist Dr Antonios Souris told Euronews.\n\n\"Although we must say the new administration is not yet in power, it is still a delicate situation,\" he added.\n\nThe world was a different place in 2016 when Trump was last elected \u2014 former Chancellor Angela Merkel was still in power, the pandemic had not choked the globe, and Russia had not yet launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIf Trump is to be re-elected, he would have to deal with the coalition government led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz \u2014 albeit possibly for less than a year since German voters are expected to elect a new chancellor and parliament in October 2025. Recent polls show the opposition conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) firmly ahead.\n\nWhat is Berlin doing?\n\nThe government is already boosting defence capabilities and working with partners to ensure that Europe remains a major world economic power regardless of who wins in the US in November, regional director of the German Marshall Fund Sudha David-Wilp told Euronews.\n\n\"Germany and its allies are making preparations for either scenario,\" she said.\n\nTransatlantic co-ordinator and FDP deputy parliamentary group leader Michael Link travelled to the US Republican Party convention in Milwaukee last week, where JD Vance was introduced as Trump's running mate. Link told Euronews that he has been preparing extensively for all scenarios for a long time.\n\n\"This includes, with regard to a possible second presidency of Trump, strengthening contacts with the US Republicans to identify where, despite all differences, there are also important shared interests,\" he said.\n\n\"I have been working on this for over two years. It also naturally includes consistently expanding contacts with promising individuals on the side of the US Democrats for the future.\"\n\nTrump with JD Vance at campaign rally, Saturday, July 20, 2024 AP Photo/Evan Vucci\n\nExperts are concerned after Trump said he would withdraw protection and encourage Russia to \"do whatever the hell they want\" to NATO member countries that didn't reach their 2% GDP spending targets back in February.\n\nOn the subject of NATO, Link said, \"the 2% goal remains Germany's central and crucial signal to the US, regardless of who is in the White House. This is in Germany's vital interest, and the federal government has already established this with the mid-term financial planning of the federal budget until 2028.\"\n\nBut Link wasn't the only one who attended the Milwaukee convention. Opposition politicians from the CDU and former health minister Jens Spahn also appeared.\n\nSouris says, \"Spahn is a central figure within the CDU, an ambitious politician with leadership responsibilities who is well-known, even abroad.\"\n\nWhat are Germany and the EU expecting?\n\nIf Trump wins, the general sense is that he might turn his attention to protecting US interests from Beijing, not Moscow.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP) researcher Laura von Daniels told Euronews that JD Vance hinted at this at February's Munich Security Conference.\n\n\"The ammunition suppliers in the US are simply not sufficient to support Ukraine any longer. These supplies are needed to protect the US against potential threats from the Pacific, from the Indo-Pacific, of China, essentially,\" von Daniels recalled.\n\nResearch Fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations Filip Medunic also thinks transatlantic relations could influence US policy on China.\n\n\"Trump has already shown in his first term, and again now, that security policy is no longer taken for granted, as it used to be, for Europe and for Germany as a close ally of the US. It has been made clear that he is ready to demand costs that must be borne by the allies,\" he added.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nVon Daniels says that Germany and Europe need to increase spending on defence and military regardless of whether the next US government is Democratic or Republican.\n\nTaiwanese soldiers take part in drills at the Army defence command base in Taitung in southern Taiwan on Wednesday, Jan. 31, 2024. Johnson Lai/Copyright 2024 The AP. All rights reserved\n\n\"I think there's a sense that with Democrats it's more of a gradual process, whereas with Trump from day one, it would be aggression attacks.\"\n\nShe also warns that Trump could pick on Germany, as he did during his last term, \"because everyone, at least in Germany, I think in the foreign policy community, is quite sure that this that he has a problem with Germany in general,\" von Daniels adds.\n\nHowever, experts warn that the next few years in Europe could get more expensive, not just due to increased military spending but also because of Trump's approach to transatlantic trade.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"I think Europe is in a harder spot because it not only will face with higher tariffs on the part of a Trump to administration, higher tariffs with the United States, but will also face a flood of Chinese goods if the US is to continue on a protectionist or even draconian trade policy under a Trump administration,\" David-Wilp said.\n\nVon Daniels also speculated that Trump could return to office \"and from day one tell us that we the he still has a trade deficit with Europe and therefore we need to stop exporting German luxury cars. And then there would be tariffs.\"\n\nBut will it be enough?\n\nAlthough the German government has been preparing well behind the scenes for a potential second Trump term, his unpredictability is still of concern.\n\nTrump is known for making quick, rash decisions and deals his way, which could potentially change history not just for Ukraine and China but also for the Middle East.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFormer US President Donald Trump with Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2018 Pablo Martinez Monsivais/Copyright 2018 The AP. All rights reserved\n\nMedunic says that last time, Trump mixed security policy, economic policy, and foreign policies and is likely to do it again, despite them traditionally being kept separate.\n\n\"Trump will try to solve many problems his way, with a deal, meaning he will quickly demand negotiations,\" he said.\n\nHe also says there is a danger \"that Germany and also Europe will be side-lined.\"\n\n\"The biggest worry is really that Trump's serious about making a deal with Putin,\" without Germany, the EU or even Ukraine having a seat at the table,\" Von Daniels said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"And then they they discuss the fate of Ukraine essentially without Ukraine having a say either and then [Germany] would be in this very isolated position where the US and Russia are discussing stuff that has immediate consequences for our own security.\"\n\nIn addition, with Germany's federal elections just over a year away, both far right and far left parties are capitalising on anti-war rhetoric.\n\n\"For example, we now have three state elections in eastern Germany where support for Ukraine is not as high as in western German states. The AfD (Alternative for Germany) is also stirring up sentiment with certain rhetoric, and the Alliance of Sahra Wagenknecht is advocating an anti-war stance and opposing further expenditures while promoting diplomacy with Russia,\" Souris said.\n\nHowever, it's not all doom and gloom. Experts say that Germany has already navigated a Trump presidency for four years and has learned lessons from last time.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nUrsula Von der Leyen, who recently secured a second term as European Commission president, is regarded by Von Daniels as \"professional and experienced enough to know that she needs a working relationship\" with the US.",

        "text": "How to Vote in the 2024 US Elections from New Zealand\n2024 is a presidential election year \u2014 but not only that. All 435 seats in the House of Representatives, 33 of the 100 Senate seats, and the governors' mansions of 11 states and two territories are on the ballot in November along with a large fraction of the over 500,000 local elected officials. U.S. citizens have the right to vote in primary and general elections, no matter where in the world they live! If you're a U.S. citizen, dual-national, or will be 18 on November 5, 2024, you have the right to vote from abroad in the November 2024 general election.\n\nAs a U.S. citizen, whether you are living, working, or traveling overseas, you can register to vote and request your ballot by submitting one form \u2014 the Federal Post Card Application (FPCA). It doesn't matter if you were registered to vote before you left the U.S., how long you\u2019ve lived outside the U.S., or if you've never resided in the U.S. You have the right to vote!\n\nThe U.S. State Department recommends that \u201call U.S. citizens living abroad complete and submit a new Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) annually, to ensure you remain on your state\u2019s voter rolls and to ensure your local election office has your up-to-date contact information.\u201d Vote From Abroad provides all the information, forms, and support help in one place to make voting easy!\n\n\ud83d\udccc Please note that there is NO IN-PERSON VOTING in New Zealand for the November election! \ud83d\udccc\n\n\u272d \u272d \u272d In 2024, the following states must mail in the ballot by postal mail.

Registering to vote and requesting your ballot for the 2024 elections\n\nStarting January 1, 2024, go to votefromabroad.org to fill out your Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) absentee ballot request \u2014 it takes 5-10 minutes! If you're not registered to vote, the FPCA also serves as a voter registration form. Choose the option to receive ballots by email.\n\nYou should fill out an FPCA every election year to ensure you remain on your state\u2019s overseas voter rolls and to ensure your local election office has your up-to-date contact information. It\u2019s important to follow these steps to register as an absentee voter from abroad because the ballots of US citizens voting from abroad have special protections and are different from the standard absentee ballot.\n\nSubmit the FPCA to your local election office in the United States. Most states allow you to submit your FPCA directly from votefromabroad.org without the need to print it out. But some states require that you submit your completed form by email attachment, fax, or postal mail. State deadlines and submission methods can be found here.\n\nIf you have any questions while filling out your request form, email [email protected]. You can also type your question in the chatbox on the website Vote From Abroad (the red circle in the bottom right-hand corner of each screen). Or visit the FAQ section on the website.\n\nWatch a video on how to use www.votefromabroad.org.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Confirming your request has been accepted \u2705\n\nAfter submitting your FPCA absentee ballot request form, call or email your local election official (LEO) to confirm they have received it and will be sending your ballot. Your LEO's contact information is listed in the instructions generated when you fill out your FPCA form at Vote from Abroad. You can also look up their contact info here.\n\nMost states provide a website where you can verify your voter status. To find your state's website, click here and scroll down to \u201cWhere Is My Ballot?\"\n\n3. Receiving your ballot \ud83d\udcec\n\nYour overseas absentee ballot is not your standard absentee ballot back home! Thanks to the MOVE Act, all states must send FPCA-requested absentee ballots to overseas voters no later than 45 days before a federal election. This year that\u2019s September 21, 2024 for the general election; the date varies by state for the primary elections.\n\nAnd, if requested, all states must send overseas voters their ballot by email.\n\nYou don't need to wait for ballots to arrive on September 21. If you're worried your ballot won't arrive on time, send in a Backup Ballot NOW. The Backup Ballot (Federal Write-in Absentee Ballot or FWAB) is specifically for overseas voters who are concerned they won't receive their official ballot in time to return it by the deadline. All details about the Backup Ballot can be found here.\n\n4. Your ballot hasn\u2019t arrived? \ud83d\udced\n\nCheck your spam folder. Still no ballot? Contact your local election official (find their contact info here) and confirm they\u2019ve sent your ballot to you.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t received your ballot by October 1 and your state requires postal mail return, we recommend you send in a Backup Ballot to make sure your vote gets to your state in time. All details about the Backup Ballot can be found here.\n\n5. Voting your ballot \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f\n\nIt\u2019s easy to get informed about candidates, ballot initiatives, and judicial candidates online. It\u2019s important to vote in every race on your ballot. State and local races are critical in 2024!\n\nThe simplest way is to vote for Democrats straight down the ballot. Some elected positions do not list a party affiliation, like school boards, judges, and others. To determine who to vote for in those cases, you can do the following:\n\nGoogle your county's local Democratic Party\n\nGo to the League of Women Voters personalized ballot service\n\nGo to Ballotpedia - Example: google \u201cBallotpedia Arizona elections 2024\u201d\n\nGoogle the candidate's name to find their campaign website\n\n6. Returning your ballot!\n\n\ud83d\udccc Remember! Only use a mail service if you cannot return your ballot electronically \ud83d\udccc\n\nBallot return methods \u2013 by email, online, postal mail, fax \u2013 vary by state. Always return your ballot as quickly as possible, but especially if your state only allows postal mail return. Find your state's exact ballot return methods here.\n\nIf your state allows email, online upload or fax for ballot return, please use these options! They\u2019re not subject to delay. Here is more information on fax submission.\n\nIf your state requires postal mail return, see info below on options from New Zealand. Please allow plenty of time to get your ballot back to the USA!\n\nCheck return times for regular mail services as well as private courier services before using.\n\nNew Jersey Voters: Please note that New Jersey allows for email or fax returns, but requires that the ballot ALSO be sent by postal mail.\n\nNew York Voters: Here are instructions on How to fold the New York State General Election ballot.\n\nNeed help scanning your ballot? Watch this video on how to scan using your smartphone. If you don't have a scanning app on your phone, you can use Adobe Scan mobile app for iPhone & Android\n\n\u27a1 International Postal Service:\n\nIf your state requires postal mail ballot return, you can use international mail from the NZ Post. It is a reliable postal service, but please remember mail service in both NZ and the US can be slow and so you should send your ballot as soon as possible!\n\nWe do not recommend spending the extra money for a tracking number when sending the envelope \u2013 it\u2019s better to confirm receipt by looking on your state\u2019s website, or looking up your local election officer's contact details here. Do NOT send it with a signature required as local elections officers will not sign for it.\n\nAsk for a postmark or date stamp to be placed on the outer envelope. Some states require this, and it is a good practice in general. Find out your state\u2019s requirements here.\n\n\u27a1 Courier Service:\n\nIf your state requires postal mail ballot return, the quickest option is to use a courier service.\n\nCall or email your local election office in the United States to check out the best address to use, and then check out courier solutions. If you use DHL, please note they do not directly deliver to some addresses in the USA, but will get your ballot package to the US and then use US Postal Service to deliver it from there. So do check if that's the case for your local election office, and allow for plenty of time.\n\nEven with expedited courier services, ballots still take several days to get to the United States. Please send your ballot as soon as possible! Do not wait! You should \u2013 and some states require you \u2013 ask for a postmark or date stamp to be placed on the outer envelope. Find out your state\u2019s requirements here. We do not recommend booking or paying online with any courier service. You will not receive a postmark if you book or pay online.\n\n\ud83d\udccc Remember! Only use a mail service if you cannot return your ballot electronically \ud83d\udccc\n\n\u27a1 The U.S. Embassy/Consulate diplomatic pouch:\n\nIt is possible to return your ballot by using the diplomatic pouch mail service at the U.S. Consulate in Auckland, and you can mail or drop-off your ballot. The U.S. Embassy in Wellington also has a drop-box; you'll need to ask the guards for permission to drop off your ballot. Using this process takes at least 4 weeks for your ballot to reach its destination, so please be aware of this. If you are keen to use the diplomatic pouch and would like some assistance, please email [email protected]. If you do choose to use the diplomatic pouch mail service, we recommend that you mail or drop off your envelope no later than October 1.\n\nFor the diplomatic pouch mail service, you will need U.S. postage on the ballot envelope, as it will be delivered into the U.S. mail system after transportation to the US by the diplomatic service. You can use a U.S. postage paid return envelope (sometimes provided with your ballot), or an envelope bearing sufficient U.S. postage. You can download a free U.S. postage-paid ballot return envelope template at FVAP.gov.\n\nAddress for ballot drop-off/mailing/couriering in Auckland: U.S. Consulate General Auckland 3rd Floor, 23 Customs St. East, Auckland CBD 1010.\n\n*If you mail or courier your ballot to the Auckland Consulate, you need to put your ballot in an outside envelope with the Consulate address on it; write \"Attention Voting Officer\" on your outside envelope.\n\n\n\nAddress for ballot drop-off in Wellington: U.S. Embassy, 29 Fitzherbert Terr., Thorndon, Wellington 6011.\n\nPlease see the U.S. Embassy website for more information.\n\n7. Checking twice to prevent mistakes \ud83d\udc40\n\nWhen filling out and packaging your ballot, don't forget to review the instructions carefully. Don't let human error spoil your ballot!\n\nRegardless of how you send in your ballot, remember that you \u2013 the voter \u2013 must be the one who places it \u201cin the mail.\u201d In some states, it is unlawful for any other person to handle your voted ballot, even if it is sealed. Unsure? Find out your state\u2019s requirements here.\n\n8. Confirming your ballot's arrival at your local election office in the United States \u2713\u2713\n\nOnce you've sent your ballot, follow up with your local election official to make sure that it arrived and will be counted. Please do not just assume that your ballot has made it!\n\nThe easiest way to ensure your ballot has arrived is to go to \"Track Your Ballot\" on your state\u2019s website. You can also look up your local election officer's contact details here and contact them directly. They may be experiencing a high volume of calls, so you may need to be persistent to get through to someone.\n\n9. Having trouble? Need help?\n\nWe understand that the voting process can be confusing \u2014 that's why we're here to help!

        "text": "2024 California Ballot Propositions\nPropositions\n\nJump to section\n\nCalifornia voters decided on only one proposition on the March primary ballot \u2014 narrowly approving Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s mental health measure, Proposition 1.\n\nIn November, voters will determine the fate of 10 propositions \u2014 including whether to borrow a combined $20 billion for climate programs and school construction, whether to approve three amendments to the state constitution and what direction to take on crime, health care and taxes.\n\nThe 2024 ballot is still more crowded than in 2022, when there were only seven measures, the fewest in more than a century.\n\nProp 2 Borrow $10 billion to build schools, colleges This bond issue would authorize the state to borrow $8.5 billion for K-12 schools and $1.5 billion for community colleges for construction and modernization. Learn More \u2192\n\nProp 3 Reaffirm the right of same-sex couples to marry This constitutional amendment would remove outdated language from Proposition 8, passed by voters in 2008, that characterizes marriage as only between a man and a woman. Learn More \u2192\n\nProp 4 Borrow $10 billion to respond to climate change This bond issue would allow the state to borrow $3.8 billion for drinking water and groundwater programs, $1.5 billion for wildfire and forest programs and $1.2 billion for sea level rise. In part, the money would offset some budget cuts. Learn More \u2192\n\nProp 5 Lower voter approval requirements for local housing and infrastructure This constitutional amendment would make it easier for local governments to borrow money for affordable housing and some other public infrastructure projects by lowering the voter approval requirement from two-thirds to 55%. Learn More \u2192\n\nProp 6 Limit forced labor in state prisons This constitutional amendment would end indentured servitude in state prisons, considered one of the last remnants of slavery. The California Black Legislative Caucus included the proposal in its reparations agenda. Learn More \u2192\n\nProp 32 Raise the state minimum wage to $18 This initiative would raise the overall minimum wage from $16 an hour and adjust it for inflation, fast food workers received a $20 an hour minimum on April 1 and health care workers will eventually get $25, though not until at least Oct. 15. Learn More \u2192\n\nProp 33 Allow local governments to impose rent controls This is the latest attempt to roll back a state law that generally prevents cities and counties from limiting rents in properties first occupied after Feb. 1, 1995. Learn More \u2192\n\nProp 34 Require certain providers to use prescription drug revenue for patients Sponsored by the trade group for California\u2019s landlords, this measure is squarely aimed at knee-capping the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which has been active in funding ballot measures (see Prop. 33). Learn More \u2192\n\nProp 35 Make permanent a tax on managed health care plans This initiative is sponsored by California\u2019s health care industry to raise more money for Medi-Cal and block lawmakers from using the cash to avoid cuts to other programs. The tax is set to expire in 2026. Learn More \u2192\n\nProp 36 Increase penalties for theft and drug trafficking This measure \u2014 supported by Republicans and law enforcement but opposed by Gov. Gavin Newsom and most Democrats \u2014 may be the most contentious on the ballot. It would partly roll back Proposition 47, approved by voters in 2014, that turned some felonies into misdemeanors.

        "text": "Betting data shows Harris's chances are on the up but Trump is still leading\nAs Joe Biden withdraws from the 2024 US presidential race and Kamala Harris gains support from prominent Democrats, data from Betfair Exchange indicates that her odds are improving.\n\nThe vice president still faces a significant challenge to surpass Donald Trump, however, who has maintained strong performance over nearly the past year.\n\nA day before Mr Biden dropped out of the presidential race, he was 57 percentage points behind Mr Trump according to betting odds data from Betfair.\n\nMr Trump's chances of winning were 64%, with Mr Biden on 7% and Ms Harris on 17%.\n\nAt the start of the 2024 Republican National Convention, just days after Mr Trump's assassination attempt, his chances stood at 69%.\n\nAfter Mr Biden dropped out of the race on Sunday, Mr Trump's chances of winning had fallen to 62%.\n\nAs Mr Biden endorsed Ms Harris on Sunday, her chances rose by six percentage points to 23% and as more endorsements come in from top Democrats today her chances have gone up to 29%, the highest recorded for the current vice president but still 33 percentage points behind Mr Trump.\n\nInterestingly, Ms Harris's chances of winning were higher than both Mr Biden and Mr Trump in 2021.\n\nMr Biden's numerous gaffes, from introducing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as Vladimir Putin, to rambling and mumbling at the first debate of the presidential season, has meant Mr Trump has enjoyed a particularly high lead over the current US president over the past month.\n\nFrom the beginning of July 2024, Mr Trump's lead over Mr Biden according to the bookies has consistently been 40 percentage points or more. From 5 July it's been at least 50 percentage points.\n\nMr Trump has consistently been ahead of Mr Biden since around the time of the current president's impeachment inquiry in September 2023, with the exception of three days in April 2024 where Mr Biden's chances were less than a percentage point more than Mr Trump.\n\nThat period covers the time leading up to Mr Trump's criminal trial, although on 30 May when he was eventually found guilty, he had a lead over Mr Biden of two percentage points.\n\nMr Biden's highest lead over Mr Trump was on 7 June 2023, when he was 18 percentage points ahead.\n\nSeveral of Mr Biden's top leads over Mr Trump occurred in June 2023, around the time indictments were filed against Mr Trump.\n\nOne was submitted on 30 March, another on 8 June, which was dismissed and two more in August which have yet to be decided.\n\nHe was found guilty on all counts of falsifying business records related to the indictment filed on 30 March.\n\nHowever, this did not significantly dent his lead, likely due to growing concerns about Mr Biden's fitness to remain in office, which ultimately led to his withdrawal from the race.\n\nThe Data and Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

For decades, the band has used its platform to fight for social justice and amplify marginalized voices while advocating for immigration policies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great satisfaction but at the same time very big because Agent of Change means many things,\u201d Hernan Hern\u00e1ndez told Billboard on the red carpet, just ahead of the awards ceremony. \u201cBut especially the people who help without expecting anything in return, help the community. Our music has helped many things, but outside of music, it helps people who need it; that gives us great satisfaction, to be able to do something with those who have given you so much. That is the distinction.\u201d\n\nThe band also shared a few words about the landscape of the 2024 presidential election in the United States. As artists who have encouraged the Latino vote, the band\u2019s leader, Jorge Hern\u00e1ndez, expressed, \u201cWe were a little nervous, but now that Mr. President has decided to leave a path for Kamala, well, I think that now we can realize the dream that we all want, and that she will be elected on this occasion, for various reasons.\u201d Adding, \u201cWe invite you to vote, those who can vote, and make their own decision. We will be fighting at any time to continue communicating to the whole nation the great importance of voting.\u201d\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nDuring the show, Los Tigres del Norte gave a powerful performance of their latest hit \u201cAqu\u00ed Mando Yo,\u201d and later thanked their families and fans for the support.\n\nThe 2024 Premios Juventud \u2014 a fan-voted awards show \u2014 is taking place at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico Jos\u00e9 Miguel Agrelot in San Juan and hosted by Lele Pons, Clarissa Molina and Wisin. For its 21st annual ceremony, Carin Le\u00f3n, Maluma, Peso Pluma, Karol G and Shakira are among the most nominated acts. Meanwhile, Anitta, Los Tigres del Norte and Lele Pons each received an Agent of Change Award, which \u201crecognizes and celebrates\u201d young entrepreneurs and prominent stars who \u201cselflessly contribute to creating a better world,\u201d according to the awards show. See the list of this year\u2019s winners here.\n\n\u2014Additional reporting by Ingrid Fajardo",

        "text": "What does the 2024 election mean for the future of AI governance?\nThe viral launch of ChatGPT one month later represented a paradigm shift for broader conversations in Washington. Of 298 bills with relevance for AI governance and usage introduced since the start of the 115th Congress, 183 of them were proposed after ChatGPT\u2019s launch (Figure 1). Despite a flurry of proposals and a series of nine expert AI Insight Forums convened in the Senate (and a subsequent roadmap ), Congress has so far failed to pass comprehensive AI legislation. Instead, the White House has steered AI governance efforts, cutting across a wide range of executive authorities. AI policy is thus particularly vulnerable to change if there is a transition to a second Trump administration in 2025.\n\nIn addition to promoting the development and adoption of AI, the Biden administration\u2019s approach to AI policy has placed more emphasis on risk and harm mitigation. One of its first major governing documents was the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights , a set of values published in October 2022 that, while not legally binding, were intended to help guide the development of safe and responsible AI.\n\nThe Trump administration also engaged in international fora around the development of AI norms. It supported the adoption of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s 2019 AI principles, became a founding member of the Global Partnership on AI in 2020, and joined the United Nations\u2019 Conference on Certain Conventional Weapons\u2019 Group of Governmental Experts in unanimously adopting a set of 11 guiding principles on the use of lethal autonomous weapons.\n\nInternationally, the Trump administration\u2019s economic strategy sought to deny adversaries, namely China, from accessing advanced technologies, and export controls became a core feature of the United States\u2019 China policy. In 2019 , Donald Trump\u2019s Department of Commerce (DOC) added Huawei and its affiliates to the Entity List , restricting the sale of goods and services without a license from DOC\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS). In 2020 , BIS also added SMIC , China\u2019s leading state-owned semiconductor foundry, to the list and ruled that no more licenses to export manufacturing equipment used for chips at the 10-nanometer node and below (the kinds used in advanced AI systems) would be approved to counter China\u2019s military modernization efforts.\n\nThough AI had not yet burst into the public conscience during the Trump administration, its policies toward AI governance generally focused on the promotion, development, and adoption of AI systems. In four years, the administration issued two major executive orders. The first established the American AI Initiative which was later codified into law. It set forth five guiding principles, including training American workers, fostering public trust and protecting civil liberties, and engaging internationally. The second outlined principles for the government\u2019s use of AI, directed the Office of Management and Budget to develop guidance for implementing the principles, required agencies to publish inventories of their AI use cases, and added an AI track to the Presidential Innovation Fellows program. Despite a nuanced approach, at the time, some were critical of the Trump administration\u2019s limited attention to risk mitigation.\n\nTwo successive administrations have attempted to address these issues, each with different interests and styles, but with some surprising overlap in objectives and policies. The next president will face major decisions on how to govern increasingly powerful and disruptive AI systems and how to prioritize challenges related to safety, innovation, competition, and risk. If the past is a prelude, the actions of both the Biden and Trump administrations offer some clues as to how the future rules of the road might be written.\n\nAs one of the most transformative technologies ever created, artificial intelligence (AI) is likely to reshape nearly every facet of society. While we are far from seeing AI\u2019s full capabilities, the guardrails put in place now will influence how this technology shapes work and productivity, democracy, war and peace, and much more moving forward.\n\nIn July 2023, the Biden administration developed a set of Voluntary AI Commitments on safety, security, and trustworthiness with a number of leading developers. While these are not legally binding, most frontier model developers have signed on and joined an industry association to guide their implementation. The centerpiece of the Biden administration\u2019s AI policy is its October 2023 executive order, which invokes the Defense Production Act to mandate that developers of advanced AI systems share safety test results with the U.S. government, imposes know-your-customer requirements on cloud service providers, and sets standards for federal agencies on AI safety, security, and privacy. The administration also released a memorandum from the Office of Management and Budget which set forth binding guidelines on AI governance, innovation, and risk mitigation for federal agencies.\n\nBeyond domestic policy, the Biden administration has engaged in AI governance conversations in bilateral and multilateral fora, including cooperation around safe and transparent AI systems through the U.S. and European Union\u2019s Trade and Technology Council, implementation of the G7\u2019s Hiroshima Process to leverage the benefits of AI while guarding against potential harms, and cooperation on safety and evaluation standards between the U.S. AI Safety Institute and an international network of analogous organizations. The United States signed a Statement of Intent to collaborate on AI safety with other countries, committed to ongoing dialogue between the EU AI Office and U.S. AI Safety Institute, and signed a partnership agreement with the United Kingdom\u2019s AI Safety Institute, which recently announced it would open a branch in San Francisco. The United States has also worked with partners on a political declaration on AI in the military and has continued to engage at the U.N.\u2019s Conference on Certain Conventional Weapons\u2019 Group of Governmental Experts.\n\nPerhaps most notably, the Biden administration restarted bilateral dialogues with China on key \u201ctechnical and policy\u201d issues, where the two sides discussed their approaches to AI safety and risk management. Despite this dialogue, the administration not only expanded Trump\u2019s tariffs in some sectors but also oversaw a \u201cseismic shift\u201d to more restrictive export controls on advanced semiconductors and manufacturing equipment. The administration also issued an executive order requiring outbound investment screening for critical emerging technology industries.\n\nLooking forward\n\nThroughout the Biden administration, Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party\u2019s likely nominee for president, has taken a leading role in AI policy efforts. She led the U.S. delegation to the United Kingdom for the Global Summit on AI Safety and facilitated a dialogue with the CEOs of leading AI developers, among other roles. Absent movement in Congress, a Harris administration will continue to be limited to existing executive authorities. It will also likely maintain many of the policies of the previous administration, with the Biden executive order (EO) as a guiding document and a continued focus on risk mitigation and responsible development and investment.\n\nTrump, by contrast, has vowed to rescind the Biden EO \u201con day one\u201d and the Republican Party platform would repeal the EO and replace it with something that supports \u201cAI Development rooted in Free Speech and Human Flourishing.\u201d This aligns with a backlash among conservative researchers, commentators, and policymakers, who have railed against the EO as an abuse of the Defense Production Act that will stifle innovation through unnecessary regulation. The most significant effect of rescinding the EO would be the end of the reporting regime for frontier model developers and cloud service providers. These requirements are one of the only legally binding transparency mechanisms for companies that develop or provide resources for the most powerful, and potentially dangerous, AI systems, and their removal would be a huge blow to the movement for guardrails on frontier AI.\n\nDespite open confrontation with China on emerging technologies and export controls, the Biden administration has engaged in dialogue on key areas of mutual concern, as evidenced by its bilateral exchanges on the climate and AI, its push to discuss nuclear risk reduction, and its participation with China in the U.K.\u2019s AI Safety Summit and the resulting Bletchley Declaration. Under a potential Harris presidency, it is likely these efforts will continue.\n\nThe Trump administration oversaw a dramatic shift in diplomatic engagements with Beijing, Trump has made clear he remains firm in his opposition to China, and commentators at the Heritage Foundation have argued that working with China on AI empowers an adversary to the detriment of U.S. technological leadership. Given this criticism and U.S. conservatives\u2019 broader rhetorical tenor against China, it is hard to imagine track one diplomatic engagement continuing uninterrupted. It is even harder to imagine agreement between the United States and China on shared rules and principles governing advanced AI systems beyond areas where there is a clear mutual interest in avoiding inadvertent escalation.\n\nThe dual objectives of stifling China\u2019s tech industry and ensuring American leadership in the development of powerful AI systems reveal clear contradictions in Trump\u2019s broader tech agenda: antagonism toward China, an opportunistic policy shift on TikTok, and a disdain for Big Tech censorship accompanied by a cozy relationship with some parts of Silicon Valley. Many of the leading developers of frontier AI models today are the same companies that Trump believes have wronged him and that conservative lawmakers criticize for exerting too much power in digital markets and silencing conservative speech. Undercutting those companies may harm America\u2019s ability to guide the development of frontier models. How the Trump administration reconciles these competing priorities is anyone\u2019s guess, though several tech leaders are betting it will net out in their favor.\n\nThere are, however, several areas where we might instead expect continuity. Export controls on advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment began under the Trump administration and accelerated under the Biden administration. There is some indication that Harris could continue this targeted approach in a new administration; however, she has been critical of Trump\u2019s tariffs in the past. Trump has said that he would impose a tariff of greater than 60% on Chinese goods, and a second Trump administration would likely take an even more aggressive posture on trade with China. As a result, this type of restriction is likely to continue or be tightened. Importantly, the implementation of the export control regime for semiconductors depends, in part, on compliance from allies\u2014in particular the Netherlands and Japan. Under a more transactional \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy, the Trump administration may struggle to maintain support from key partners who control vital chokepoints in the semiconductor supply chain. This could make it even more difficult to thwart China\u2019s AI and military progress.\n\nShould Trump win a second term in office, we are also likely to see a continued focus on extreme harms of AI safety (e.g., biotech), but less of a focus on AI\u2019s impact on civil rights. A key focus of the Biden administration\u2019s AI policy has been the impact of the technology on workers, marginalized communities, and other groups that are particularly vulnerable to disruption from transformative technologies. In her address ahead of the Bletchley Summit, Harris rejected a narrow focus on existential risk, remarking that harms to individual rights and well-being \u201calso feel existential\u201d to those they affect. Given the strong deregulatory bent of the first Trump administration and the Republican Party more broadly, coupled with Trump\u2019s hostility toward ideas like diversity, equity, and inclusion and \u201cwokeness,\u201d these challenges may be deprioritized as part of a second Trump administration\u2019s AI policy.\n\nThere does seem to be general convergence around AI safety and the potential catastrophic risks from frontier AI systems as important policy issues. Trump himself has called AI a \u201csuperpower\u201d that is \u201cvery disconcerting\u201d and even opponents of Biden\u2019s EO have recognized the need for guardrails. Though there is widespread opposition among Republican leaders to perceived executive overreach by the Biden administration, the earlier voluntary commitments could be the type of nonbinding, self-governance measures that a deregulatory second Trump administration might favor.",

Share Copy Link Copy\n\nGREATEST HONORS OF MY LIFE TO SERVE AS VICE PRESIDENT TO OUR PRESIDENT. JOE BIDEN. JOE\u2019S LEGACY OF ACCOMPLISHMENT OVER HIS ENTIRE CAREER AND OVER THE PAST THREE AND A HALF YEARS IS UNMATCHED IN MODERN HISTORY. IN ONE TERM. THINK ABOUT IT IN ONE TERM, AS PRESIDENT, HE HAS ALREADY SURPASSED THE LEGACY OF MOST PRESIDENTS WHO SERVED TWO TERMS IN OFFICE. AND I KNOW WE ARE ALL DEEPLY, DEEPLY GRATEFUL FOR HIS CONTINUING SERVICE TO OUR NATION. AND IT IS MY GREAT HONOR TO HAVE JOE BIDEN\u2019S ENDORSEMENT IN THIS RACE. SO, WISCONSIN, I AM TOLD AS OF THIS MORNING THAT WE HAVE EARNED THE SUPPORT OF ENOUGH DELEGATES TO SECURE THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION. AND I AM SO VERY HONORED, AND I PLEDGE TO YOU I WILL SPEND THE COMING WEEKS CONTINUING TO UNITE OUR PARTY SO THAT WE ARE READY TO WIN IN NOVEMBER. SO, FRIENDS, WE HAVE 105 DAYS UNTIL ELECTION DAY, AND IN THAT TIME WE\u2019VE GOT SOME WORK TO DO. BUT WE\u2019RE NOT AFRAID OF HARD WORK. WE LIKE HARD WORK, DON\u2019T WE? AND WE WILL WIN THIS ELECTION. YES, WE WILL. SO AS LEAH TOLD YOU BEFORE, I WAS ELECTED VICE PRESIDENT, BEFORE I WAS ELECTED TO THE UNITED STATES SENATOR, I WAS ELECTED ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND I WAS A COURTROOM PROSECUTOR BEFORE THEN. AND IN THOSE ROLES I TOOK ON PERPETRATORS OF ALL KINDS. PREDATORS WHO ABUSED WOMEN, FRAUDSTERS WHO RIPPED OFF CONSUMERS, CHEATERS WHO BROKE THE RULES FOR THEIR OWN GAIN. SO HEAR ME WHEN I SAY I KNOW DONALD TRUMP\u2019S TYPE. AND IN THIS CAMPAIGN I PROMISE YOU, I WILL PROUDLY PUT MY RECORD AGAINST HIS ANY DAY OF THE WEEK. AS HIS ATTORNEY GENERAL OF CALIFORNIA, I TOOK ON ONE OF OUR COUNTRY\u2019S LARGEST FOR PROFIT COLLEGES. THAT WAS SCAMMING STUDENTS. DONALD TRUMP RAN A FOR PROFIT COLLEGE THAT SCAMMED STUDENTS. AS A PROSECUTOR, I SPECIALIZED IN CASES INVOLVING SEXUAL ABUSE. WELL, TRUMP WAS FOUND LIABLE FOR COMMITTING SEXUAL ABUSE AS ATTORNEY GENERAL OF CALIFORNIA. I TOOK ON THE BIG WALL STREET BANKS AND HELD THEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR FRAUD. DONALD TRUMP WAS JUST FOUND GUILTY OF FRAUD ON 34 COUNTS. BUT LET\u2019S ALSO MAKE NO MISTAKE, THIS CAMPAIGN IS NOT JUST ABOUT US VERSUS DONALD TRUMP. THIS CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT WHO WE FIGHT FOR. THIS IS ABOUT WHO WE FIGHT FOR. JUST LOOK AT HOW WE ARE RUNNING OUR CAMPAIGNS. SO DONALD TRUMP IS RELYING ON SUPPORT FROM BILLIONAIRES AND BIG CORPORATIONS AND HE IS TRADING ACCESS IN EXCHANGE FOR CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS. A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO, YOU ALL SAW THAT A COUPLE MONTHS AGO AT MAR-A-LAGO. HE LITERALLY PROMISED BIG OIL COMPANIES, BIG OIL LOBBYISTS, HE WOULD DO THEIR BIDDING FOR $1 BILLION IN CAMPAIGN DONATIONS. ON THE OTHER HAND, WE ARE RUNNING A PEOPLE POWERED CAMPAIGN. AND WE JUST HAD SOME BREAKING NEWS. WE JUST HAD THE. BEST 24 HOURS. OF GRASSROOTS FUNDRAISING IN PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN HISTORY. ALL RIGHT. AND BECAUSE WE ARE A PEOPLE POWERED CAMPAIGN, THAT IS HOW YOU KNOW, WE WILL BE A PEOPLE FIRST PRESIDENCY. AND WISCONSIN, THIS CAMPAIGN IS ALSO ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT VISIONS FOR OUR NATION ONE WHERE WE ARE FOCUSED ON THE FUTURE, THE OTHER FOCUSED ON THE PAST. WE BELIEVE IN A FUTURE WHERE EVERY PERSON HAS THE OPPORTUNITY, NOT JUST TO GET BY, BUT TO GET AHEAD. A FUTURE WHERE NO CHILD HAS TO GROW UP IN POVERTY, WHERE EVERY WORKER HAS THE FREEDOM TO JOIN A UNION. WHERE EVERY PERSON HAS AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE, AFFORDABLE CHILDCARE AND PAID FAMILY LEAVE. WE BELIEVE IN A FUTURE WHERE EVERY SENIOR CAN RETIRE WITH DIGNITY. SO ALL OF THIS IS TO SAY, BUILDING UP THE MIDDLE CLASS WILL BE A DEFINING GOAL OF MY PRESIDENCY. BECAUSE HERE\u2019S THE THING WE ALL HEAR WISCONSIN KNOW WHEN OUR MIDDLE CLASS IS STRONG, AMERICA IS STRONG. BUT DONALD TRUMP WANTS TO TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACKWARD. HE AND HIS EXTREME PROJECT 2025 AGENDA. WILL WEAKEN THE MIDDLE CLASS LIKE WE KNOW. WE GOT TO TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY. AND CAN YOU BELIEVE THEY PUT THAT THING IN WRITING? READ IT. IT\u2019S 900 PAGES. BUT HERE\u2019S THE THING. YOU, WHEN YOU READ IT, YOU WILL SEE DONALD TRUMP INTENDS TO CUT SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE. HE INTENDS TO GIVE TAX BREAKS TO BILLIONAIRES AND BIG CORPORATIONS AND MAKE WORKING FAMILIES FOOT THE BILL. THEY INTEND TO END THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. AND TAKE US BACK THEN TO A TIME WHEN INSURANCE COMPANIES HAD THE POWER TO DENY PEOPLE WITH PREEXISTING CONDITIONS. REMEMBER WHAT THAT WAS LIKE CHILDREN WITH ASTHMA, WOMEN WHO SURVIVED BREAST CANCER, GRANDPARENTS WITH DIABETES, AMERICA HAS TRIED THESE FAILED ECONOMIC POLICIES BEFORE, BUT WE ARE NOT GOING BACK. WE ARE NOT GOING BACK, NOT GOING BACK. WE\u2019RE NOT GOING BACK. WE ARE NOT GOING BACK. AND I\u2019LL TELL YOU WHY WE\u2019RE NOT GOING BACK, BECAUSE OURS IS A FIGHT FOR THE FUTURE. AND IT IS A FIGHT FOR FREEDOM. GENERATIONS OF AMERICA\u2019S GENERATIONS. AND WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THIS. THE SHOULDERS ON WHICH WE STAND, GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS BEFORE US LED THE FIGHT FOR FREEDOM AND NOW WISCONSIN. THE BATON IS IN OUR HANDS. WE WHO BELIEVE IN THE SACRED FREEDOM TO VOTE WILL MAKE SURE EVERY AMERICAN HAS THE ABILITY TO CAST THEIR BALLOT AND HAVE IT COUNTED. WE WHO BELIEVE THAT EVERY PERSON IN OUR NATION WHO SHOULD HAVE THE FREEDOM TO LIVE SAFE FROM THE TERROR OF GUN VIOLENCE, WILL FINALLY PASS RED FLAG LAWS, UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS, AND AN ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN. AND WE WHO BELIEVE IN REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM. WILL STOP DONALD TRUMP\u2019S EXTREME ABORTION BANS BECAUSE WE TRUST WOMEN TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR OWN BODIES AND NOT HAVE THEIR GOVERNMENT TELL THEM WHAT TO DO. AND WHEN CONGRESS PASSES A LAW TO RESTORE REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOMS AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, I WILL SIGN IT INTO LAW. SO WISCONSIN, ULTIMATELY, IN THIS ELECTION, WE EACH FACE A QUESTION WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY DO WE WANT TO LIVE IN? A COUNTRY. AND TO YOUR POINT, DO WE WANT TO LIVE IN A COUNTRY OF FREEDOM, COMPASSION AND RULE OF LAW OR A COUNTRY OF CHAOS, FEAR AND HATE? AND HERE\u2019S THE BEAUTY OF THIS MOMENT. WE EACH HAVE THE POWER TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. THE POWER IS WITH THE PEOPLE WE EACH HAVE THE POWER TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. AND IN THE NEXT 105 DAYS, THEN WE HAVE WORK TO DO. WE HAVE DOORS TO KNOCK ON. WE HAVE PHONE CALLS TO MAKE. WE HAVE VOTERS TO REGISTER, AND WE HAVE AN ELECTION TO WIN. SO WISCONSIN, TODAY, I ASK YOU, ARE YOU READY TO GET TO WORK? DO WE BELIEVE IN FREEDOM? DO WE BELIEVE IN OPPORTUNITY? DO WE BELIEVE IN THE PROMISE OF AMERICA? AND ARE WE READY TO FIGHT FOR IT? AND WHEN WE FIGHT, WE WIN THE BLESS YOU. GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. SOMEBODY YOU\u2019VE BEEN LISTENING TO VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS SPEAKING TO A CROWD AT WEST ALLIS CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL. HARRIS HOLDING HER FIRST RALLY AFTER LAUNCHING HER CAMPAIGN SUNDAY HOURS AFTER PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN DROPPED OUT AND ENDORSED HER. WE DO KNOW THAT, SHE SAID. THE PATH TO THE WHITE HOUSE RUNS THROUGH WISCONSIN, WHICH IS A BIG REASON WHY SHE\u2019S HERE TODAY. CAMPAIGNING IN MILWAUKEE IN WEST ALLIS, POLITICAL DIRECTOR MATT SMITH JOINS US LIVE ON THE PHONE FROM THE RALLY. MATT, WHAT DO YOU WHAT DO YOU THINK ARE YOUR BIGGEST TAKEAWAYS FROM THIS RALLY. MALLORY THE CAMPAIGN WAS LOOKING FOR DEMOCRATIC UNITY, AND THEY WERE LOOKING FOR A LOUD CROWD. AND THAT IS WHAT THEY GOT. AT LEAST INSIDE THIS GYMNASIUM SOME 3000 PEOPLE, SUPPORTERS. THAT IS A RECORD FOR A CAMPAIGN EVENT FOR THE BIDEN HARRIS TEAM. NOW, OBVIOUSLY JUST THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN. THIS IS HER FIRST OFFICIAL CAMPAIGN RALLY AS A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. THIS GYMNASIUM WAS PACKED AS THE VICE PRESIDENT PLEADED WITH WISCONSIN DEMOCRATS TO GET ACTIVE. SHE MENTIONED 105 DAYS LEFT AS SHE CONTINUES TO WORK THE ROPE LINE HERE. SOME SUPPORTERS TRYING TO GET SELFIES IN THIS, HER OFFICIAL STOP. JUST SOME 48 HOURS AFTER PRESIDENT BIDEN DROPPED OUT OF THIS RACE, THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY SAID THIS WAS GOING TO BE ABOUT UNITY. WE\u2019LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE NEXT 105 DAYS. THE CROWD AT ONE POINT CHANTING LOCK HIM UP, REFERRING TO FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, REMINISCENT OF REPUBLICANS YELLING LOCK HER UP FROM 2016, REFERRING TO HILLARY CLINTON. THE CROWD CHEERING KAMALA AS SHE WALKED OUT. SHE WASTED NO TIME. FIRST, AFTER THANKING PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN, ACKNOWLEDGING THAT SHE NOW HAS THE DELEGATES NEEDED TO SECURE THE NOMINATION AT THE CONVENTION. IN CHICAGO, SHE WASTED NO TIME GOING AFTER FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, A PREVIEW OF WHAT WE ARE GOING TO SEE ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, STARTING AT THIS MOMENT IN WISCONSIN, SHE HAS SAID THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS SAID THIS IS NOW A CAMPAIGN ABOUT PROSECUTING DONALD TRUMP\u2019S RECORD AND HISTORY. A NUMBER OF PROMINENT WISCONSIN DEMOCRATS HERE, GOVERNOR TONY EVERS, SENATOR TAMMY BALDWIN, BOTH SPEAKING BEFORE THE VICE PRESIDENT ALONG WITH MAYOR CAVALIER JOHNSON, MILWAUKEE COUNTY EXECUTIVE DAVID CROWLEY. THE CAMPAIGN AT THIS MOMENT, MALLORY LOOKS TO SEE THIS AS A PIVOTAL MOMENT, A RESET OF SORTS. BUT THERE IS A DRAMATICALLY SHORT TIME FRAME HERE. THERE IS NEW POLLING GOING INTO THE FIELD TOMORROW FROM THE MARQUETTE LAW SCHOOL POLL. THE QUESTION IS HOW MUCH OF A RESET IS THIS IN KEY SWING STATES LIKE WISCONSIN, WHERE TRUMP HAS HAD A34, FIVE POINT LEAD OVER PRESIDENT BIDEN, THE HEAD TO HEAD MATCHUPS WITH KAMALA HARRIS HAVE NARROWED IT A BIT. BUT THIS IS A MOMENT THAT DEMOCRATS SAY THEY NEEDED, AND THEY WILL LOOK TO CAPITALIZE AS THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WILL LOOK TO RESPOND. AND THIS NEW CAMPAIGN, SO TO SPEAK, BETWEEN HARRIS AND TRUMP, KICKS OFF AT THIS MOMENT IN MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN. MALLORY POLITICAL DIRECTOR MATT SMITH REPORTING FROM THAT RALLY AT WEST ALLIS CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL, WHERE VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS JUST SPOKE TO A CROWD REALLY KICKING OFF HER CAMPAIGN TO BE T\n\nGET OUR POLITICS NEWSLETTER Stay up to speed on all the latest local and national political news.

        "text": "The Fed Could Cut Interest Rates Before The Election, Risking Political Fallout\nKey Takeaways The Federal Reserve appears to be on track to cut its benchmark interest rate in September, just two months ahead of the general election in November.\n\n\n\nAccording to conventional wisdom, a rate cut could boost the economy and encourage voters to reward the incumbent political party.\n\n\n\nFed officials value the central bank's independence and avoid stepping into political matters or favoring either party.\n\n\n\nThe risk of being accused of favoritism hasn't stopped the Fed from election-season rate cuts in the past when economic conditions warranted them.\n\n\n\nPolicymakers at the Federal Reserve try to avoid politics at all costs\u2014but the central bank is widely expected to cut interest rates ahead of the November presidential election, a move that risks causing backlash.\n\nThe trajectory of the economy has set the Fed on a collision course with the general election, and possibly with former president Donald Trump, the Republican candidate in the 2024 race. Investors and economists expect the Fed to cut its benchmark interest rate by September.\n\nBut in an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek last week, Trump said a Fed rate cut ahead of the election was \u201csomething that they know they shouldn\u2019t be doing.\"\n\nWhy The Election Could Be Troublesome For The Fed\n\nThe dilemma for the Fed\u2019s Open Market Committee (FOMC), which makes decisions on interest rates, is that it\u2019s supposed to be independent. Fed officials say the central bank does its job more effectively because it stays out of the political fray.\n\nInterest rate cuts during election season, however, could call that independence into question.\n\n\u201cIf the Fed aggressively cuts its key interest rate, interest rates like mortgage rates, credit card rates and other borrowing rates will likely follow,\u201d Mike Walden, an emeritus economics professor at North Carolina State University wrote in a blog post earlier this year. \u201cMore people will be able to buy homes, vehicles and other items, lifting consumer confidence and happiness. And, if people are more confident and happier, they may be more likely to reward incumbent politicians by voting for them.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd helping one party\u2014in this case, the Democrats\u2014could provoke the opposition in this election season. Some members of the Trump campaign have reportedly floated proposals to give the president a say in the Fed\u2019s decisions on monetary policy.\n\n\u201cThe FOMC has an undeniable (if never acknowledged) incentive to avoid initiating cuts in the last two months of a presidential election campaign,\u201d Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a commentary.\n\nElections Haven\u2019t Stopped Past Rate Cuts\n\nExpectations have risen that the Fed will soon cut its benchmark rate from its current 23-year high because economic activity has slowed and inflation is on the path down toward the central bank's 2% annual target.\n\nFed officials recently have acknowledged the progress in taming inflation, while also saying that a delay in cutting rates could cause unemployment to rise. The Fed has a dual mandate to keep prices stable and maintain maximum employment.\n\nDespite all the reasons to avoid election-season rate cuts, the Fed has made them in the past, Meera Pandit, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Chase, noted in a recent commentary.\n\nThe last time the Fed cut rates within two months of an election was in 2008 when the Fed chopped rates to near zero during the Great Recession. Before that, the Fed cut rates in 1992 as the economy slowed. Neither of those rate cuts helped the incumbent party to stay in power, as in both years the White House changed hands from Republicans to Democrats.\n\n\u201cWhether the Fed was adjusting based on dynamic economic conditions, responding to severe recessions, or following a path already forged, it continued to pursue its dual mandate irrespective of elections,\u201d Pandit wrote.\n\n",

        "text": "US presidential election energizes fast-growing Indian American community\nU.S. Vice President Kamala Harris' meteoric rise to the top of the Democratic Party's presidential ticket has energized many Indian Americans, raising the fast-growing community's political profile and sparking widespread excitement.\n\nHarris, who is of Indian and Jamaican descent, appears set to become the first female presidential nominee of color after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race on Sunday. But the fervor isn't solely about her nomination.\n\nMany Indian Americans, regardless of political leanings, are equally electrified to see other notable figures of Indian descent in the national spotlight: Usha Vance, the wife of Republican vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance, as well as former presidential candidates Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\n\"I'm very proud that Indian Americans are making it on every stage,\" said Shaker Narasimhan, chair and founder of AAPI Victory Fund, a super PAC focused on mobilizing Asian American and Pacific Islander voters and supporting Democratic candidates.\n\nNarasimhan recalled being on a call with about 130 people when news broke that Biden had dropped his presidential bid and endorsed Harris.\n\n\"Everything lit up, literally: the chats, the DMs, the phones,\" Narasimhan said. \"But it was all with excitement, not wonderment, like, 'Wow.' It was like, 'Oh my God, let's go,' This is just the opportunity of a lifetime, as far as I'm concerned, for us to show our muscles.\"\n\nThe enthusiasm cuts across the political spectrum. Priti Pandya-Patel, co-founder of the New Jersey Republican Party's South Asia Coalition, said the community is buzzing about the prospect of Usha Vance becoming the country's first Indian American second lady.\n\n\"I think it's just a proud moment to see our community actually being out there and being noticed,\" Pandya-Patel said. \"I think that is definitely getting our Indian community very excited.\"\n\n5 million in US\n\nIndian Americans are one of the fastest-growing immigrant communities, surging more than tenfold since the early 1990s.\n\nToday, there are roughly 5 million people of Indian descent living in the United States, making them the largest Asian ethnic group and the second-largest immigrant group after Mexicans.\n\nWhile Indian Americans vote Democratic more than any other Asian group, roughly 20% identify as Republican.\n\nThe Indian American community has traditionally been perceived as politically less active than some other ethnic groups. However, there are indications of growing political engagement within the community.\n\nA recent survey of Asian Americans, including those of Indian descent, found that 90% intended to vote in the November election even though 42% had not been contacted by either party or candidate.\n\nThe Asian American Voter Survey, of nearly 2,500 voters, was conducted between April 4 to May 26 by several Asian American groups.\n\n\"So that suggests a potential gap in engagement,\" said Suhag Shukla, co-founder and executive director of the non-partisan Hindu American Foundation.\n\nShukla said the election presents a \"tremendous opportunity\" for the Indian American community as well as the two major political parties.\n\n\"I think Indian Americans need to recognize their power, especially because many of us do live in either purple states or purple districts,\" Shukla said in an interview with VOA, referring to battleground states in the U.S. presidential election. \"On the flip side, I think that it's a real opportunity for the parties to do not just a checkmark or a checkbox-type outreach, but genuine outreach. Have town halls. Have listening sessions.\"\n\nSpokespeople for the Harris and Trump campaigns did not respond to questions about their community outreach efforts.\n\nBoth campaigns mobilize voters through grassroots organizations.\n\nDeepa Sharma, deputy director of South Asians for Harris and a delegate to next month's Democratic National Convention, said her group is \"working closely with people on the ground who will knock on doors, will do phone bank and outreach to this community.\"\n\nIndian Americans comprise less than 1% of U.S. registered voters, according to a 2020 study by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. But almost one-third live in closely contested battleground states such as Georgia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.\n\nThat puts them in a position to sway the outcome of the November election, said Chintan Patel, executive director of Indian American Impact, a progressive group.\n\n\"The South Asian American population far exceeds the margin of victory in the closest elections in these states,\" Patel said.\n\nVoter turnout steadily climbing\n\nIn 2020, the Biden-Harris ticket carried more than 70% of the Indian American vote, according to Patel, adding that support for Harris is likely to edge higher this year.\n\n\"She has drawn considerable support from the South Asian American community because she has consistently shown up and fought for our values, fought for our issues,\" Patel said.\n\nEarlier this year, Harris spoke at Indian American Impact's \"Desis Decide\" summit, where she credited Indian Americans and Asian Americans with helping to get two Democratic senators elected in 2020 and 2021.\n\nPatel said voter turnout among South Asian Americans has been steadily climbing in recent years. In 2020, for example, more than 70% of registered South Asian American voters turned out to vote in Pennsylvania, he said.\n\n\"I think they're going to be instrumental in delivering the White House this November,\" Patel said.\n\nSimilar predictions by groups such as Muslim Americans have sometimes failed to materialize.\n\nBut Narasimhan said turnout could be boosted with the right voter mobilization strategy, adding that voter education is key.\n\n\"Just because you're a citizen doesn't mean you can vote, you have to register,\" Narasimhan said. \"Teaching people the basic rudimentaries of what's early voting, what's absentee balloting, what's going to the polls, navigating the system is critical, and we have to do that basic education.\"\n\nOn the Republican side, activists are betting that Trump's close ties to India's Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi will translate into votes for the former president.\n\n\"Trump has been friendly to India and that makes a big difference,\" Pandya-Patel, the Republican activist in New Jersey, said.\n\nWhether Indian American support for Trump is rising remains unclear.\n\nIn the recent Asian American Voter Survey, 29% of Indian Americans said they intended to vote for Trump, largely unchanged from four years ago.\n\nTrump has called Modi a \"true friend.\" In 2019, he and Modi addressed a joint rally in Houston, Texas, that attracted more than 50,000 people, many supporters of the Indian prime minister. At the \"Howdy, Modi!\" rally, Trump called Modi \"one of America's greatest, most devoted and most loyal friends.\"\n\nPandya-Patel said the rally boosted Indian American support for Trump, whose friendship with Modi, she added, is a key reason many Indian Americans back him.\n\nShukla of the Hindu American Foundation said there is a perception among some Indian Americans that the Democratic Party is not \"a Hindu-friendly party.\"\n\nThat may partly explain a recent \"shift\" in Indian American party affiliation, she said.\n\nIn the Asian American Voter Survey, the number of Indians who identify as Democrats fell from 54% in 2020 to 47% in 2024, while those identifying with the Republican Party rose from 16% to 21%.\n\nAnang Mittal, a Virginia-based commentator who previously worked for House Speaker Mike Johnson, said the apparent shift reflects less a \"sea change\" than shifting political attitudes.\n\n\"I think the country as a whole is sort of shifting towards Republicans because of the larger issues that are plaguing this election,\" Mittal said.",

        "text": "Barack Obama endorses Kamala Harris for president in 2024 US election\nBarack Obama has endorsed Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee for US president, meaning the vice-president has now won the backing of all the party\u2019s politically active high-profile figures for her White House bid.\n\nThe former president had conspicuously withheld his endorsement in the immediate aftermath of Joe Biden\u2019s decision to withdraw from the campaign, and was initially believed to favour an open nominating contest at next month\u2019s Democratic national convention in Chicago.\n\nBut after Harris earned the backing of Bill and Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi, a host of state governors and the most senior Democrats in Congress \u2013 as well as Biden himself \u2013 Obama has added his voice in what amounts to a major boost for the vice-president.\n\nThe 44th president was joined by wife Michelle, the former first lady, in a phone call with Harris that was filmed and released by her campaign on Friday. In the video, Harris is seen listening to the Obamas on an iPhone in her right hand.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t have this phone call without saying to my girl Kamala: I am proud of you,\u201d Michelle Obama says. \u201cThis is going to be historic.\u201d\n\nBarack Obama weighs in: \u201cWe called to say Michelle and I couldn\u2019t be prouder to endorse you and do everything we can to get you through this election and into the Oval Office.\u201d\n\nSmiling, standing near a vehicle, Harris replies: \u201cOh my goodness. Michelle, Barack, this means so much to me, I am looking forward to doing this with the two of you, Doug and I both. And getting out there, being on the road.\u201d\n\nShe adds: \u201cBut most of all, I just wanna tell you that the words you have spoken and the friendship that you have given over all these years mean more than I can express. So thank you both! It means so much. And, and we\u2019re gonna have some fun with this too, aren\u2019t we?\u201d\n\nThe endorsement comes as the Harris campaign, which has made a flying start, launches a \u201cweekend of action\u201d marking 100 days until the election with more than 170,000 volunteers and 2,300 events across battleground states.\n\nObama was the first Black US president and is endorsing a candidate who, if she wins against Donald Trump in November, will become the first woman, first Black woman and first person of south Asian descent to serve as president.\n\nHarris has narrowed the gap with Trump in opinion polls, trailing him 48% to 47% among likely voters in a New York Times/ Siena College survey. Trump was leading Biden by six percentage points in this poll after their debate.",

        "text": "Economic Factors and Currency Volatility in the 2024 US Presidential Election\nIn March 2024, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) concluded its extensive monetary easing program, including its negative interest rate policies, which had been in place for over eight years. The central bank maintained its interest rate at 0.10%. Traders are now closely watching for any signals from the BOJ regarding quantitative tightening (QT), as the bank is expected to gradually reduce its bond holdings. This process, if not carefully managed, could potentially disrupt the market. To mitigate this, the BOJ might opt to reduce bond purchases at a slower rate than their holding expiration, a strategy requiring cautious execution.\n\nThe Japanese yen is currently trading near its lowest point versus the dollar in 38 years, and at a level not seen since 1986, worrying traders.Despite both the US and Japan maintaining their interest rates for a prolonged period, the yen has continued to weaken against the dollar, contributing to market uncertainty. As a result, and in a measure to stop \u2018excessive fluctuations driven by speculation\u2019, the Bank of Japan is known to have intervened at least once in recent history, aiming to prop up yen prices. Owing to abnormalities in price action, some traders have speculated that market intervention has happened more than just once, but the BoJ has yet to officially confirm.\n\nAlthough the BOJ is in a rate-raising mode and the Fed is expected to cut rates, the interest rate differential between the US dollar and the Japanese yen remains appealing. Carry trades on USD/JPY can still offer returns for long-term investors, though these returns may be lower than other carry trade opportunities. However, they might also involve less risk compared to other available carry trade pairs.",

        "text": "Election 2024: Kamala Harris Is the Democratic Presidential Nominee\nWhat a difference a week makes.\n\nJust seven days ago, Republicans were coming off a successful party convention thinking that the 2024 race was turning into a rout. Meanwhile, Democrats feared that the Republicans were right. Some Democrats worried that President Joe Biden would stay in a race he had little chance of winning. Other Democrats feared that Biden\u2019s exit would trigger intra-party fighting that would guarantee Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House.\n\nAs it happened, everyone was wrong. Biden acknowledged on Sunday afternoon that his campaign was hemorrhaging support and ended his campaign. Democrats quickly coalesced around Vice President Kamala Harris as their candidate. And a race that looked to be breaking for the Republicans once again tightened.\n\nThe Water's Edge James M.

Within thirty-six hours of Biden\u2019s decision she had locked up the support of a majority of the delegates to the Democratic National Convention. She and the Democratic Party also raised more than $100 million from more than 1.1 million donors, most of whom were new donors. Her candidacy energized a Democratic base that was lukewarm about Biden\u2019s candidacy even before his disastrous debate performance.\n\nHarris\u2019s coronation benefited from the fact that no other prominent Democrat threw their hat into the ring even as powerbrokers like Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi indicated that they favored an open nominating process. One reason for the absence of challengers was the fear of being blamed for trying to keep Harris from ascending to the top of the ticket. Another reason was that the campaign war chest that the Biden-Harris campaign compiled likely could go only to Harris. It\u2019s hard to run a winning campaign without deep pockets, especially when Election Day is just over three months away.\n\nHarris used her first campaign event to lay out her electoral message. Speaking at a high school in a Milwaukee suburb not far from where the Republicans convened last week, she stressed that she will, like the district attorney she once was, prosecute the case against Trump as a threat to America\u2019s democracy. She also made clear that defending abortion rights and improving the economy top her to-do list.\n\nHarris said nothing of note about foreign policy while on the campaign trail, which reflects both political calculation and personal preference. China, Gaza, Ukraine, and other issues overseas fall far down their list of priorities. At the same time, Harris made her career as a district attorney and attorney general, not as a diplomat or military strategist. She certainly has foreign policy experience\u2014both from her time as a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and as vice president for the past three-plus years. But that is not the same thing as having a passion for it.\n\nThe fact that Harris does not have an extensive foreign policy record independent of her work as vice president has prompted speculation about what her foreign policy might be. Her general approach to foreign policy will almost certainly be in the same area code as Biden\u2019s\u2014and most other Democrats\u2014if not the same zip code. Indeed, some 350 foreign policy luminaries signed a letter vouching for her foreign policy bona fides. What no one knows, however, is what her priorities and red lines will be. The world looks different when one moves from adviser to decider.\n\nRepublicans made much of Harris\u2019s refusal to preside over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s address to Congress on Wednesday. That critique loses whatever force it is supposed to have had once one considers that Republican Vice-Presidential Candidate J.D. Vance also skipped the speech.\n\nThe Trump campaign will also seek to hang the Biden administration policy failures at the U.S. southern border on Harris. House Republicans yesterday passed a resolution \u201cstrongly condemning\u201d Harris by name as the \u201cBorder Czar\u201d for her \u201cfailure to secure the United States border.\u201d Six Democrats supported the resolution. Harris\u2019s obvious retort is that Trump pressured congressional Republicans into walking away from a bipartisan deal to address the border crisis because a continued crisis helped him politically.\n\nAs historic as Harris\u2019s first week was, her road to the White House remains challenging. Only one sitting vice president, George H.W. Bush, has ascended to the presidency via the ballot box in the last 188 years. Harris is also serving a president whose public approval rating just hit a new low of 36 percent. And unlike many other established democracies, the United States has never elected a woman to be head of government.\n\nThe lesson to keep in mind, as Harris should know firsthand from her failed 2020 presidential race, is that strong starts don\u2019t guarantee winning finishes.\n\nCampaign Update\n\nTrump seems conflicted about whether to debate Harris. After Biden bowed out of the race on Sunday, Trump took to Truth Social to argue that the scheduled September 10 debate \u201cshould be held on FoxNews, rather than very biased ABC.\u201d On Tuesday, he told reporters that he was game to square off against Harris, even on ABC, which he called \u201ca joke.\u201d He went on to say that presidential nominees have \u201can obligation to debate\u201d and that he \u201cwould be willing to do more than one debate actually.\u201d Then yesterday, the Trump campaign tweeted that it would be \u201cinappropriate to schedule things with Harris because Democrats very well could still change their minds.\u201d In response, Harris tweeted: \u201cWhat happened to \u2018any time, any place?\u2019\u201d While all this was happening, Fox News invited Harris and Trump to debate on September 17. The network suggested that the debate be held in Pennsylvania with a format to be determined. No word yet on whether the candidates will accept the offer.\n\nDemocrats plan to hold a virtual roll call by August 7 to determine their nominee. The move reflects uncertainty over whether the change that a special session of the Ohio state legislature recently made to the state\u2019s electoral laws would allow a candidate selected at the Democratic National Convention later in August to make the state\u2019s ballot in 2024. One practical consequence of the virtual roll call vote is that any Democrat seeking to challenge Harris for the nomination has until this weekend to file the necessary paperwork to be considered.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. has been absent from the campaign trail in recent weeks. The Washington Post reported that he met with Trump last week in Milwaukee. Kennedy reportedly offered to quit the race if Trump promised him a job in his administration should he return to the White House. Trump declined the offer.\n\nWhat the Candidates Are Saying\n\nTrump made clear on social media and on the campaign trail that he\u2019s not a fan of Harris, although he contributed $6,000 to Harris\u2019s reelection campaign for California\u2019s attorney general back in 2012 and 2013. On Truth Social, Trump called Harris \u201cLyin\u2019 Kamala Harris.\u201d\n\nIn a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Wednesday, Trump called Harris \u201cthe most incompetent and far-left vice president in American history,\u201d insisted that she was a \u201cradical left lunatic who will destroy our country,\u201d and vowed that he was \u201cnot going to be nice\u201d to her. The unity moment has passed.\n\nHarris met with Netanyahu late yesterday afternoon. She followed up the meeting with brief remarks to the press. She stressed that \u201cIsrael has a right to defend itself,\u201d blasted Hamas as \u201ca brutal terrorist organization,\u201d said she had \u201cserious concern about the scale of human suffering in Gaza,\u201d called for quick action to \u201cget a cease-fire to end the war,\u201d and endorsed the two-state solution \u201cas the only path that ensures that Israel remains a secure Jewish and Democratic state.\u201d\n\nIt was a sign of the changing order in the White House that Harris rather than Biden spoke to the press.\n\nWhat the Pundits Are Saying\n\nElliott Cohen argued in The Atlantic that Trump isn\u2019t likely to make significant changes in U.S. foreign policy should he return to the White House. His reasoning for why \u201ca second Trump term may not be a riot of alliance-shattering isolationism, bellicose warmongering, or catastrophically stupid diplomacy?\u201d It\u2019s largely that \u201cone of the deeper truths about American foreign policy, rejected every four years by Democrats and Republicans alike, is that it has much more continuity to it than rupture.\u201d That, of course, is an argument that is true up until the moment it isn\u2019t. And Cohen admits that if Trump populates his administration with \u201csome of the marginal figures in his camp, such as the disgraced and dotty Michael Flynn, or for political figures like Senator Tom Cotton and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u201d\u2014which could well happen\u2014then \u201cserious trouble awaits.\u201d Perhaps the critical question, though, isn\u2019t how different Trump\u2019s foreign policy will be, but the effectiveness of whatever foreign policy he chooses to follow.\n\nForeign Policy\u2019s Stephen Walt dismissed the foreign policy that Trump and Vance are championing as unrealistic and likely to \u201cdo enormous long-term damage to America\u2019s global position.\u201d Walt, who sympathizes with Trump\u2019s distrust of Washington\u2019s foreign policy elites, believes that \u201cthe central problem is that Trump and Vance are operating with an outdated picture of America\u2019s place in the world and its ability to get its way unilaterally. They may reject neoconservatism, but they believe the United States can do whatever it wants and that other states will simply bend to its will. This wasn\u2019t true during the \u201cunipolar moment,\u201d however, and it is even less true now that China is an economic peer and states from India to Brazil to South Africa to Turkey are charting their own courses and able to play the other major powers off against one another.\u201d\n\nUniversity of Texas historian Jeremy Suri wrote in Foreign Policy that Vance isn\u2019t likely to shape U.S. foreign policy in a second Trump administration should Trump win in November. He bases his conclusion on the fact that most vice presidents have little or no impact on foreign policy, which has been the case for more than two centuries. Along the way Suri retells one of the best descriptions ever made about the vice presidency. It was uttered by someone who should know, Thomas Marshall, who served as Woodrow Wilson\u2019s understudy for eight years: \u201cOnce there were two brothers. One ran away to sea; the other was elected vice president. And nothing was ever heard of either of them again.\u201d Suri\u2019s piece is worth reading just to see how many U.S. vice presidents lamented their decision to be the spare tire of government.\n\nThe New York Times\u2019s Lisa Friedman charted Harris\u2019s views on climate change. The topline is that \u201cHarris has for years made the environment a top concern, from prosecuting polluters as California\u2019s attorney general to sponsoring the Green New Deal as a senator to casting the tiebreaking vote as vice president for the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, the largest climate investment in United States history.\u201d\n\nAaron Mannes assessed Harris\u2019s work in the Biden administration for Foreign Policy. He noted that she \u201chas faced significant barriers to helping Biden. Since the expansion of the vice-presidential role in the late 1970s, most presidents have been outsiders to Washington, D.C. \u2026.. Biden, with 36 years in the Senate (during which he focused on foreign affairs) and eight years as vice president, had little need for assistance.\u201d He added that Harris\u2019s \u201cforeign-policy work does not indicate a grand strategy or worldview. Instead, her work has been about developing a skill set of policymaking and implementation, as well as learning and using the tools available to her office.\u201d\n\nMatt Duss, a former foreign policy advisor to Sen. Bernie Sanders, argued in Foreign Policy that Harris can reset U.S. policy toward Gaza. Duss acknowledged that \u201cno one expects Harris to dramatically distance herself from Biden.\u201d However, she \u201ccan announce that as president, she will immediately suspend the U.S.-supplied military aid being used in violation of U.S. law. She can publicly make clear that she agrees with the assessment of countless Israelis\u2014including Israeli opposition lawmakers and top sitting security officials\u2014that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is stalling hostage release and cease-fire efforts in order to cling to power. She can reject the baseless and inflammatory claims that the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), the largest and most important relief agency in Gaza, is a \u201cHamas front,\u201d and state that she\u2019ll work to see UNRWA funding resumed as soon as legally possible. In doing so, she would join U.S. partners\u2014such as Britain, France, and Germany\u2014that have already resumed their contributions.\u201d\n\nWhat the Polls Show\n\nAn AP-NORC poll conducted before Biden dropped out of the race found that nearly six in ten Americans want Trump to drop out of the race as well. Not surprisingly, support for an end to Trump\u2019s candidacy was highest among Democrats, with 86 percent favoring his departure. But 51 percent of Independents and 26 percent of Republicans felt the same way.\n\nThe Campaign Schedule\n\nThe Democratic National Convention opens in Chicago in twenty-four days (August 19, 2024).\n\nThe second presidential debate is in forty-six days (September 10, 2024)\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s sentencing hearing on his New York felony convictions is in fifty-four days (September 18, 2024).\n\nThe first in-person absentee voting in the nation begins in Minnesota and South Dakota in fifty-six days (September 20, 2024).\n\nElection Day is 102 days away.\n\nInauguration Day is 178 days away.\n\nShelby Sires assisted in the preparation of this post.",

James Carville issued a warning to the party that it is not going to be easy in the months ahead of the presidential election in November. The party will need to focus on certain key strategies.He made these comments when he appeared on the MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe show. He said that there is enthusiasm in the party after Joe Biden quit the race and Kamala Harris emerged as a front runner to replace him. She has also already raised more than $200 million within 24 hours. However, she is going to find that the campaign will only get tough.The presidential election will take place on November 5 and the Democrats will hold their national convention from August 19-22. There may be a virtual roll call before the national convention. Kamala Harris is expected to receive the presidential nomination during this period. Can she afford to take it lightly till then?This is what Carville has warned against. He pointed out that a presidential campaign , normally lasts over a period of eight months and now Harris will have to execute this campaign in less than four months. Time is running out and she will to work hard and strategically plan out the campaign. She will need to focus on the swing states. Joe Biden\u2019s popularity in these states had considerably reduced in recent times. She will need to work on re-capturing the support from these states.Carville also pointed out that Donald Trump has managed to convince a large section of the electorate to support him. He may have lied, used disinformation tactics and everything else to take on the Democrats. Kamala Harris will need to work on breaking this complex phenomenon and address the voters directly. He added that the Republicans do not care about what is fair and what is not and this will pose a challenge to the Democrats.Many political analysts consider her as a political novice. She had contested the party primaries in 2020 against Joe Biden and dropped out at an early stage. She may find it tough to take on a former president who is viciously campaigning to return to the White House for a second term.Most of those front runners have now fully endorsed Harris\u2019 nomination. She has received the support from almost all the Democrats, cutting across various interest groups. There are news reports that Michelle Obama may receive a nomination and may replace Joe Biden. This is yet to be seen.",

        "text": "What is Project 2025? A look at the conservative presidential wish list\nTrump has distanced himself from the Project 2025 though some ideals align.\n\nWhat is Project 2025? A look at the conservative presidential wish list\n\nProject 2025, a 922-page playbook of controversial policy proposals intended to guide the next conservative administration, is gaining attention as the presidential election campaigns heat up.\n\nProject 2025 has been authored by at least two dozen members of Donald Trump's administration and allies, organized by conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation and is backed by more than 100 additional groups.\n\nDemocrats say the plan is a warning of what is to come under a second Trump term, while Trump has tried to distance himself from the policy proposals: \"They are extreme, seriously extreme,\" said Trump in a July 20 rally. \"I don\u2019t know anything about it. I don\u2019t want to know anything about it.\"\n\nProject 2025 officials told ABC News that it does \"not speak for any candidate or campaign.\" However, Trump's official campaign plan called Agenda47 aligns with several proposals in Project 2025.\n\nSo, what is in Project 2025?\n\nSome of Project 2025's goals\n\nThe project suggests disbanding federal agencies like the Department of Education -- an idea Trump has supported -- and the Department of Homeland Security. It recommends privatizing others, including the Transportation Security Agency, and would expand presidential control over the executive branch.\n\n\"The modern conservative president\u2019s task is to limit, control and direct the executive branch on behalf of the American people,\" the project reads in its first section titled, \"Taking the Reins of Government.\"\n\nRepublican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally, July 9, 2024, in Doral, Fla. Rebecca Blackwell/AP\n\nOn health care, the project recommends withdrawing the abortion pill mifepristone from the market and stopping the drug from being mailed, eliminating mandated insurance coverage for the week-after pill, prohibit funding for patients traveling across state lines for reproductive health care and prohibit funding for health care centers that provide abortions.\n\nAdditionally, the project suggests that the Department of Health and Human Services should \"maintain a biblically based, social science-reinforced definition of marriage and family.\"\n\nOn climate change, Project 2025 suggests cutting federal money for research and investment in renewable energy, and instead calls for the next president to \"stop the war on oil and natural gas.\"\n\nThe project aims to repeal and eliminate preventive climate change initiatives. The project calls for replacing carbon-reduction goals to instead increase the use of fossil fuel energy production and \"energy security.\"\n\nThis aligns with Trump's official Agenda47, in which Trump said he plans to make America the \"No. 1 producer of oil and natural gas in the world.\"\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security seal August 21, 2019 in Washington, DC. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nOn economics, the proposals recommend cutting and restricting the use of food stamps and social welfare programs, creating more eligibility requirements for Medicaid, creating a two-rate individual tax system of 15% and 30%, reducing the corporate income tax rate, cutting rates for high-income investors and canceling federal student loan forgiveness programs.\n\nOn housing, the project recommends that it reverse several Biden administration policies, including the Housing Supply Fund, which states that it provides funding and low-income housing tax credits to \"address market gaps, increase housing supply and help to stabilize housing prices over the long term \u2026 [and] remove barriers to affordable housing development.\"\n\nIt also would remove Biden-backed programs aimed at addressing housing discrimination, including the Property Appraisal and Valuation Equity program and affirmatively furthering fair housing.\n\nTrump's Agenda47 broadly calls for new home construction, tax incentives and cutting housing regulation.\n\nThe US Department of Education February 9, 2024, in Washington, DC. J. David Ake/Getty Images\n\nOn diversity, the project proposes eliminating several terms from \"every federal rule, agency regulation, contract, grant, regulation, and piece of legislation that exists\" including: \"sexual orientation,\" \"gender,\" \"gender equality,\" \"gender awareness,\" \"gender-sensitive\" \"abortion,\" \"reproductive health,\" \"reproductive rights,\" \"diversity, equity, and inclusion\" and more.\n\nOn immigration, the project advocates for immediately deporting unaccompanied children, increased funding for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, for the implementation of fees for asylum seekers and speedier processing at a premium price, pause funding for nongovernmental immigration groups and more.\n\nProject 2025 also advocates for a \"merit-based immigration system,\" and urges the next president to get rid of the existing employment visa process, the family-based chain migration process and lottery systems, replacing it with a system \"to award visas only to the best and brightest.\"\n\nIn Trump's Agenda47, he states he plans on carrying out \"the largest deportation operation in American history\" as well as reinstated Trump-era policies including increased focus on the border wall.\n\nOn education, the document calls for increased school choice and parental control over schools -- limiting federal school accountability and encouraging every parent to direct their child\u2019s share of public education funding \"to choose a set of education options that meet their child's unique needs\" -- which has been embraced by several conservative leaders through ESA programs.\n\nIt also bars public education employees from using a name or pronoun other than what is listed on a student's birth certificate without a parent's permission, and it would not require a school employee to use a name or pronoun for someone \"that does not match a person\u2019s biological sex if contrary to the employee\u2019s or contractor\u2019s religious or moral convictions.\"\n\nTrump similarly backs school choice policies, eliminating tenure for teachers, defund schools that \"promote gender transition,\" and plans to \"promote love of country\" in education.\n\nHe also states on his website that he plans to sue large private universities and \"use that money to endow a new institution called the American Academy.\"\n\nSeparately, the project recommends that pornography be \"outlawed\" and criminalize its distribution.\n\nIs Trump tied to Project 2025?\n\nWhile Trump has said that he doesn't know anything about Project 2025, several of the former president's current and former advisers and appointees have authored or supported the project.\n\nThey include:\n\nChristopher Miller -- who served as Acting Secretary of Defense and Special Assistant to the President under Trump -- is credited with the project's Department of Defense recommendations.\n\nBen Carson -- who served as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) under Trump -- is credited with the project's (HUD) recommendations.\n\nBrendan Carr -- who was appointed to serve as a member of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) -- is credited with the project's FCC recommendations.\n\nAdam Candeub -- who served under the Trump administration as Acting Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Telecommunications and Information -- is credited with the project's Federal Trade Commission recommendations\n\nBernard L. McNamee -- who was nominated to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Trump -- is credited with recommendations on the Department of Energy and Related Commissions.\n\nAdditionally, the RNC platform committee's policy director, Russ Vough, authored a portion of the Project 2025 plan.\n\nThe RNC platform committee's Deputy Policy Director Ed Martin is also president of the Eagle Forum Education & Legal Defense Fund, which is listed on the project's advisory board.\n\nPresident Joe Biden speaks from the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, July 14, 2024. Susan Walsh/AP\n\nOthers connected to Trump, including Trump's United Nations Commission on the Status of Women appointee Lisa Correnti, are listed among the contributors.\n\nSome conservatives are distancing themselves from Project 2025, including former Trump adviser Stephen Miller, who is requesting the removal of his organization, America First Legal, from the website's list of advisory board members, sources familiar with the situation told ABC News.\n\nHowever, Trump's official Agenda47 and the proposals uplifted by the Republican National Committee align in part with some of Project 2025's goals.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's campaign has used Project 2025 in its efforts to motivate voters away from Trump.\n\n\"Project 2025 is the plan by Donald Trump\u2019s MAGA Republican allies to give Trump more power over your daily life, gut democratic checks and balances, and consolidate power in the Oval Office if he wins,\" Biden's campaign states on its website.\n\nABC News' Will Steakin and Soo Rin Kim contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Trump vs Harris: What US elections will mean for T\u00fcrkiye\nWith the U.S. presidential race looking all but set to come down to a Donald Trump versus Kamala Harris ticket, the outcome of the November election will impact agitated relations with T\u00fcrkiye as well.\n\nRegardless of whether a Democrat or a Republican is in the White House, Ankara will have much to tackle in its dealings with Washington in the upcoming period, a range of differing stances that threaten to evolve into full-blown crises if left unattended any longer.\n\nExperts argue that a Harris presidency could preserve the Joe Biden-installed status quo if not guided by more T\u00fcrkiye-friendly advisers, while Trump's return could at the least reignite long-dead dialogue on the Turkish-U.S. front.\n\nDuring the four years Trump steered the White House, relations with T\u00fcrkiye could best be described as \u201cturbulent,\u201d marked by several high-tension incidents, including the 2018 Pastor Brunson crisis, the YPG problem and Washington\u2019s attitude on FET\u00d6, that often highlighted the downward trajectory of the past decade.\n\nNow, with Trump\u2019s potential return to power, T\u00fcrkiye can look forward to a return to dialogue, according to \u00c7a\u011fr\u0131 Erhan, the president of Alt\u0131nba\u015f University and a member of the Presidential Security and Foreign Policies Council.\n\n\u201cThis was not the case during Biden\u2019s term when Barack Obama\u2019s bureaucrats came back to power and channels of dialogue were essentially eliminated and several issues like the F-16 deal, F-35 fighter jets, northern Syria were left hanging,\u201d Erhan said.\n\nSyrian snag\n\nProblems that began during Obama\u2019s presidency, or even farther back in 2003 during the Iraqi war, continued into Trump and Biden\u2019s terms, but it was Trump who more often heeded T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s concerns about the YPG, the Syrian offshoot of the terrorist group PKK, that has occupied the oil-rich region since 2015.\n\nThe PKK took up arms against the Turkish state in 1984 to achieve so-called Kurdish self-rule in southeastern regions and is designated a terrorist organization by Ankara, as well as the United States and the European Union.\n\nWashington calls the YPG its ally under the pretext of driving out remaining Daesh terrorists, something Ankara considers as support of a threat against its national security. Turkish cross-border airstrikes have targeted the YPG in the region since 2016.\n\nAt the time, Trump showed a willingness to address T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s concerns over the YPG, promising to remove it from the Turkish border area but later failing to do so.\n\nIt was the U.S. military\u2019s pressure that kept him from making any radical changes to Washington\u2019s Syria policy about T\u00fcrkiye, according to Kadir \u00dcst\u00fcn, the executive director at the Washington branch of the Foundation for Political, Economic and Social Research (SETA).\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s reelection could reenergize the management of certain crises, including Syria,\u201d \u00dcst\u00fcn told Daily Sabah. \u201cIn that case, the strategic dialogue mechanism also needs a strong boost and his administration must care about political coordination with Ankara.\u201d\n\nIn the past four years, in stark contrast to frequent one-on-ones with Trump, Biden has not paid a single visit to T\u00fcrkiye, nor did he host President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan in the White House. Adding to the grievances, his administration has refused to cut off support to the YPG or extradite G\u00fclenist Terrorist Group (FET\u00d6) members, including its ringleader Fetullah G\u00fclen, who oversaw a deadly coup attempt in T\u00fcrkiye in July 2016.\n\nMore recently, the NATO allies have been at loggerheads over Israel\u2019s brutal war on the Gaza Strip. Ankara, a staunch defender of the Palestinian cause, has repeatedly slammed the U.S. for giving express military and political shield to Israel and its \u201cwar crimes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis attitude alone demonstrates Biden\u2019s perspective on the Middle East,\u201d Erhan said, whom he accused of sporting a \u201clack of seriousness\u201d in failing to keep promises, particularly with the F-16 deal now stuck at Congress.\n\nHe believes under Trump, Ankara and Washington must navigate a three-tiered negotiation process to address problems like Syria, Gaza, fighter jets, FET\u00d6 and trade, although Trump\u2019s firm support of Israel is still \u201cunacceptable\u201d for T\u00fcrkiye.\n\nU.S. Vice President and Democratic Presidential candidate Kamala Harris speaks at West Allis Central High School during her first campaign rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, U.S., July 23, 2024. (AFP Photo)\n\nHarris\u2019 elites\n\nErhan doesn\u2019t believe there is any indication Harris, \u201cwho has no known foreign policy,\u201d could undo the Biden-inflicted damage on bilateral issues or introduce fresh policies toward T\u00fcrkiye, either.\n\n\u00dcst\u00fcn, however, is more optimistic about a foreign policy shift from Harris, citing her national security adviser Philip Gordon\u2019s 2008 book \u201cWinning T\u00fcrkiye,\u201d proposing plans to ease tensions in the region.\n\n\u201cSince her foreign policy knowledge is incomparable to Biden\u2019s, she will seek out more consultations and depending on who she will appoint as Secretary of State or national security adviser, her presidency could create a positive dynamic for T\u00fcrkiye,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to international relations expert Murat Aslan, however, any sympathy or anti-sympathy from the U.S. toward T\u00fcrkiye is irrelevant in shaping the White House\u2019s T\u00fcrkiye policy.\n\nWhat matters is how the U.S., which, independent of Biden, Trump, or Harris, adheres to its own state tradition, positions T\u00fcrkiye pertaining to global issues, Aslan quipped.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. interests have led Washington to cooperation in Europe, keeping Asia-Pacific on its axis and a state of competition with T\u00fcrkiye in the Middle East,\u201d Aslan said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this will change any time soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not realistic to expect Harris to change U.S. engagement with T\u00fcrkiye if she maintains (Biden\u2019s) ruling elite,\u201d he said.\n\nAslan argued that the more relations are strained with T\u00fcrkiye, the more support Washington lends to the YPG and the more T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s \u201cexistential threat motivation\u201d surges in the fields the allies compete.\n\n\u201cWashington must decide if it wants to compete with T\u00fcrkiye in the region, especially on Syria, or cooperate with it,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump\u2019s terms, Israel\n\nErdo\u011fan, who is known for his cordial relationship with Trump, recently said, \u201cWe are planning to do very interesting things\u201d with the former U.S. president.\n\nThe Turkish leader could have meant that Trump is inclined to revise Middle Eastern policies and even make radical decisions, \u00dcst\u00fcn argued.\n\nHe also predicts Ankara and Washington will remain at odds over Palestine, especially after the U.S. has recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, but Trump\u2019s desire to \u201cmake history\u201d by facilitating peace in Palestine and Ankara\u2019s critical role in the conflict indicates a potential for close coordination for a two-state solution.\n\nAslan, however, argued Trump could make any normalization with Ankara conditional on normalization with Israel, as he has in the past with the Brunson crisis. Trump imposed sanctions on two Turkish ministers and doubled tariffs on Turkish metals, threatening to plunge the lira to secure Brunson\u2019s release, who was jailed for two years on espionage charges.\n\nSince Israel began bombing Gaza, killing nearly 40,000 Palestinians in retaliation to Hamas\u2019 cross-border Oct. 7 attack, Ankara has been a vocal critic of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as Erdo\u011fan branded him the \u201cButcher of Gaza\u201d and cut off all trade.\n\n\u201cSuch a stipulation would put T\u00fcrkiye in a dilemma,\u201d Aslan said.\n\nStill, he believes Trump, who has voiced positive remarks similar to T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s arguments on certain issues, could be directed by his presidential experience and manage more stability in relations with T\u00fcrkiye come January.",

Mark Kelly, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper \u2014 who would provide demographic balance for the first major party ticket that would be topped by a woman of color. Three of them are from battleground states.\n\n\n\nThe list of possibilities could expand or shift. But Harris, who has locked up the delegates she will need to be the Democratic nominee, hopes to finish the process in time for delegates to also vote on her running mate when they hold a virtual roll call vote in the first few days of August, ahead of the Democratic National Convention. The goal, according to one of the people with knowledge of the matter, is to keep the process drama-free, as Harris and Democrats try to project confidence after an extraordinarily tumultuous few weeks for the party.\n\n",

        "text": "Risk and Resilience: Preparing for Uncertainty in the 100 Days to the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election\nJuly 27 will mark the beginning of the 100-day countdown to the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election. President Biden's decision on July 21 to end his reelection campaign capped off a series of significant events over the last two months, including the July 13 assassination attempt on former President Trump while he was speaking at a campaign rally in Butler, PA.\n\nBoth developments have taken place amid an already elevated domestic security environment, stemming from threats related to the Israel-Hamas conflict, election-related disinformation, ongoing activity from a myriad of movements with a variety of grievances, and the desire by a range of extremist and terrorist groups to sow further civil unrest and political violence. As such, the final countdown leading up to election day, as well as the immediate aftermath, has the potential to repeatedly and impactfully disrupt normal business operations. To effectively navigate this uncertainty, organizations and their leaders would be remiss not to develop multifaceted preparations that include robust intelligence analysis and scenario planning, as well as reinforce their crisis preparedness, business continuity and security plans.\n\nWhat the Next 100 Days Will Look Like\n\nThe political landscape will be highly dynamic over the next 100 days, particularly the next several weeks, which in turn will impact the various vectors at play that influence the domestic security environment. In the lead up to and during the Republican National Committee (RNC) Convention, held in Milwaukee, WI from July 15-18, the Republican Party was focused on solidifying its base and appealing to independent voters. In addition to formally cementing the Party\u2019s candidate for president, the focus of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) Convention, scheduled to take place in Chicago, IL from August 19 to 22, will be attempting to unify the party and rallying both democrats and undecided voters. A range of actors \u2013 including activist movements, extremist groups and foreign adversaries and their influence operations \u2013 have already demonstrated their intent to capitalize on this uncertainty and will likely continue to seek to do so in the following ways:\n\nElection-related mis- and disinformation will surge: The final stretch leading up to the election will likely see a notable surge in election-related mis- and disinformation campaigns, targeting both parties, individual candidates up and down the ballot, as well as the integrity of the elections themselves. A variety of actors \u2013 including foreign adversaries, domestic political and extremist groups and individual threat actors \u2013 are likely to contribute to this trend. Their motivations range from undermining public trust in the electoral process, influencing voter behavior and hence attempting to influence election outcomes, and creating as much disruption and disarray as possible to undermine social order and cohesion. These campaigns will, unsurprisingly, play out online on mainstream and fringe social media platforms, with commercial and public generative AI tools facilitating these efforts. Since July 13, mainstream and fringe social media have been saturated with commentary, conspiracy theories and charged rhetoric related to the assassination attempt, blending with other election-related misinformation that targets both parties, individual candidates and the integrity of the elections themselves. Similarly, since President Biden\u2019s announcement that he is stepping aside and endorsing Vice President Harris, online commentary featuring the latter has seen a notable uptick across mainstream and fringe social media.\n\nThe final stretch leading up to the election will likely see a notable surge in election-related mis- and disinformation campaigns, targeting both parties, individual candidates up and down the ballot, as well as the integrity of the elections themselves.

Similarly, since President Biden\u2019s announcement that he is stepping aside and endorsing Vice President Harris, online commentary featuring the latter has seen a notable uptick across mainstream and fringe social media. Political groups and activist movements will likely increase the scale and intensity of protests: These next 100 days will take place amid the backdrop of the continued Israel-Hamas war, which currently faces heightened potential of spilling over to an Israel-Hezbollah war. This will further pull in the U.S., Iran and other global players. The reverberations of the war have already been felt across the U.S., with pro-Palestinian and anti-war protests persisting since October 2023. Over the next 100 days, these protests will not only continue, but likely escalate in terms of scale and intensity as groups attempt to keep their calls for a ceasefire and associated demands front and center for both parties and their candidates. A range of other political groups and activist movements, including those advocating for climate action, social justice and reproductive health issues, will follow similar suit. The intensity and frequency of these protests may increase as election day approaches, including in the form of joint protest activity between various groups and movements, as witnessed by collaboration between pro-Palestinian and climate activist groups in recent months.\n\nThese next 100 days will take place amid the backdrop of the continued Israel-Hamas war, which currently faces heightened potential of spilling over to an Israel-Hezbollah war.

Continued targeting of election officials and judges: Over the past four years, there has been a notable trend of targeting election officials physically, digitally and reputationally. Over the next 100 days, election officials and judges are likely to continue to be targeted, including in the form of threats and harassments. The motivations behind these actions are likely to stem from differing political ideologies and discouraging voter turnout in certain locations, as well as seeking to disrupt or challenge the legitimacy of the electoral process. Consistent with trends to date, threats and disruptions will likely take place primarily at the local level, though factors like election-related mis- and disinformation and campaign-related developments could expand the disruption surface.\n\nOver the past four years, there has been a notable trend of targeting election officials physically, digitally and reputationally.

Consistent with trends to date, threats and disruptions will likely take place primarily at the local level, though factors like election-related mis- and disinformation and campaign-related developments could expand the disruption surface. Heightened terrorist threat environment stemming from the war in Gaza: Since the October 7 Hamas attacks in Israel and the Israeli military\u2019s subsequent operations in Gaza, U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies have noted the consistent dissemination of extremist propaganda focused on attacking U.S. targets across the world given the Biden administrations support of Israeli military operations. While developments related to Israeli-Palestinian relations have long been a rallying cry for a variety of foreign terrorist organizations and violent extremist actors, the current war in Gaza has provided renewed fervor to these calls. Much of the world\u2019s attention is focused on the Paris Olympics, with intelligence agencies focused on preventing or disrupting potential terrorist threats targeting the games. As such, foreign terrorist organizations, their supporters and lone actors motivated by a range of ideologies may view this time as an opportunity to attack targets in the U.S. In addition, following the assassination attempt of former President Trump, various groups may attempt to exploit the current tense and uncertain domestic situation to create further disruption.\n\nElection Day Vulnerabilities\n\nAs voters head to the polls on November 5, the primary threat of disruption comes from organized groups attempting to engage in voter intimidation, continued protests, as well as violent clashes stemming from either of these scenarios, as further detailed below:\n\nPotential for voter intimidation by organized groups: A variety of actors, including armed militias, may engage in voter intimidation efforts at polling places, as witnessed during the 2022 mid-term elections. More recently, law enforcement in Milwaukee, WI removed individuals from polling stations for being disruptive. These groups may attempt to intimidate certain members of the electorate or specific demographics from voting or create a hostile environment to deter people from voting.\n\nA variety of actors, including armed militias, may engage in voter intimidation efforts at polling places, as witnessed during the 2022 mid-term elections. More recently, law enforcement in Milwaukee, WI removed individuals from polling stations for being disruptive. These groups may attempt to intimidate certain members of the electorate or specific demographics from voting or create a hostile environment to deter people from voting. Key polling places may serve as hotspots for protests: Polling places, particularly in districts with key electoral races or urban centers that have been the focal point of prior large-scale protests, may become hotspots for demonstrations led by a variety of protest movements. While many of these demonstrations may be pre-planned and include groups that have protested in the lead-up to election day, spontaneous protests may also erupt, potentially driven by accusations of voter suppression, electoral fraud or general political grievances.\n\nPolling places, particularly in districts with key electoral races or urban centers that have been the focal point of prior large-scale protests, may become hotspots for demonstrations led by a variety of protest movements. While many of these demonstrations may be pre-planned and include groups that have protested in the lead-up to election day, spontaneous protests may also erupt, potentially driven by accusations of voter suppression, electoral fraud or general political grievances. Risk of violence is high for election night: Finally, the potential for violence looms over election night/until final votes are counted, either from voter intimidation or protests escalating into clashes, or if the election results prove to be contentious. As election results trickle in and winners are announced, there is an increased risk of confrontations between various groups at polling stations or prominent locations, especially if results are close or disputed, or if there are delays in counting votes. In such scenarios, there is also the potential for spontaneous demonstrations and confrontations, as well as incitements to violence on election night by certain candidates or extremist actors, which could result in organized demonstrations immediately thereafter. As noted in a recent article in Wired magazine, militia leaders \u2013 including those who prominently participated in the January 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol in 2021 \u2013 are already organizing and preparing for potential civil unrest related to the elections.\n\nFinally, the potential for violence looms over election night/until final votes are counted, either from voter intimidation or protests escalating into clashes, or if the election results prove to be contentious.

Amplification of mis- and disinformation and calls for violence: Any of the above scenarios will involve, and be further exacerbated by, online discourse and the amplification of election-outcome-related mis- and disinformation and incitements to violence. Social media and online communications platforms will not only serve as the mediums for the spread of such commentary and incitement, but they will also serve as virtual organizing spaces. This, in turn, can lead to groups mobilizing rapidly and further escalating volatile situations. A scenario similar to the January 6 riots or smaller riots at State Capitols or other government buildings and city landmarks across the country is plausible.\n\nPost-November 5 Domestic Security Landscape\n\nThe post-election security landscape will heavily depend on the outcome of the elections, including outcomes in key senate and congressional races in addition to the presidential contest, as well as any related potential calls for violence. While a detailed post-election threat analysis is premature, one of the below scenarios and immediate implications are likely. This assessment assumes that Kamala Harris is the Democratic Party\u2019s nominee for president.\n\nHarris wins, Trump concedes: In this scenario, the transition of power is likely to be relatively smooth, with efforts from both parties to ensure stability and continuity. Protests and disinformation may persist online and certain groups may mobilize to cause disruptions, but they are less likely if former President Trump concedes and encourages his supporters to accept the election outcome.\n\nIn this scenario, the transition of power is likely to be relatively smooth, with efforts from both parties to ensure stability and continuity.

Harris wins, Trump does not concede: If Vice President Harris wins the presidential election, but former President Trump refuses to concede, the country could face a prolonged period of not just political uncertainty, but one of immense insecurity and volatility. In this scenario, widespread protests and civil unrest may ensue.\n\nIf Vice President Harris wins the presidential election, but former President Trump refuses to concede, the country could face a prolonged period of not just political uncertainty, but one of immense insecurity and volatility. In this scenario, widespread protests and civil unrest may ensue. Trump wins, Harris concedes: Should former President Trump win and Vice President Harris concede, the country\u2019s collective focus will likely shift to the next administration\u2019s policies and the political dynamics in Congress. However, individuals and groups who are in opposition to former President Trump\u2019s platform and policies are likely to continue protesting, leading to the possibility of confrontations between protesters and counter protesters.\n\nShould former President Trump win and Vice President Harris concede, the country\u2019s collective focus will likely shift to the next administration\u2019s policies and the political dynamics in Congress. However, individuals and groups who are in opposition to former President Trump\u2019s platform and policies are likely to continue protesting, leading to the possibility of confrontations between protesters and counter protesters. Trump wins, Harris does not concede: While we assess this scenario to be the least likely, should former President Trump win but Vice President Harris not concede, we expect a similar situation to the second scenario outlined above: political uncertainty, as well as mass demonstrations and calls to action by a variety of actors, including individuals and groups associated with either party. We further anticipate the possibility of some domestic extremist groups mobilizing to pressure Harris to concede; there may also be groups who seek to capitalize on the uncertainty to create chaos and disruption.\n\nHow Should Corporations Prepare?\n\nGiven the highly dynamic and potentially volatile political and security landscape leading up to the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, we recommend organizations and executives contemplate a multi-faceted strategy aimed at proactively addressing the implications of the potential scenarios outlined above. In addition to considering whether to make internal or public statements in response to these scenarios, organizations should also consider implementing the below recommendations to actively prepare for potential related disruptions to business operations and/or election-related violence.\n\nMonitor critical information and engage in robust anticipatory intelligence analysis: Intelligence functions within organizations should ensure they are utilizing a robust toolkit to collect critical information related to political and security developments in key domestic markets. This information should then be rigorously analyzed to anticipate potential risks and identify potential signposts and indicators of escalation or new threats. Scenario planning that incorporates these signposts and effectively maps out implications and steps to mitigate resulting risks is an important part of such tailored intelligence analysis.\n\nIntelligence functions within organizations should ensure they are utilizing a robust toolkit to collect critical information related to political and security developments in key domestic markets.

Scenario planning that incorporates these signposts and effectively maps out implications and steps to mitigate resulting risks is an important part of such tailored intelligence analysis. Evaluate and update crisis management and incident response plans: Organizations should consider updating emergency response plans to address scenarios such as civil unrest, violent protests and potential attacks on company property, as well as conduct simulation exercises to ensure that all key personnel are familiar with crisis and incident protocols and plans. As part of this, organizations should also consider establishing clear communication channels for disseminating information quickly and effectively to employees and all relevant stakeholders during an incident or prolonged period of crisis.\n\nOrganizations should consider updating emergency response plans to address scenarios such as civil unrest, violent protests and potential attacks on company property, as well as conduct simulation exercises to ensure that all key personnel are familiar with crisis and incident protocols and plans. As part of this, organizations should also consider establishing clear communication channels for disseminating information quickly and effectively to employees and all relevant stakeholders during an incident or prolonged period of crisis. Enhance physical and cybersecurity measures: Organizations should consider strengthening security protocols at company headquarters, branch offices and key facilities \u2013 and evaluate whether measures in support of protection of high-profile executives, board members or other key employees require enhancements. Organizations should also consider increasing cybersecurity efforts to protect against potential cyberattacks that could target company data and communications systems. This should include deployment of multi-factor authentication (MFA) on company-issued devices, ensuring that all systems are up to date with the latest security patches, and confirming that all employees are trained on recognizing phishing attempts and other cyber threats. Organizations should also coordinate with relevant law enforcement and government agencies at both the national and local levels to stay informed about potential risks and coordinate responses as required.\n\nOrganizations should consider strengthening security protocols at company headquarters, branch offices and key facilities \u2013 and evaluate whether measures in support of protection of high-profile executives, board members or other key employees require enhancements.

Prepare for business continuity challenges: Organizations should evaluate and assess whether any alternative suppliers or logistical routes need to be identified to enable redundancies and mitigate the impact of potential disruptions, particularly in the event of a contested election and a scenario where the losing candidate fails to concede. Similarly, organizations should take stock of any critical materials and supplies to maintain operations in case of prolonged domestic disruptions at the local or national level.\n\nOrganizations should evaluate and assess whether any alternative suppliers or logistical routes need to be identified to enable redundancies and mitigate the impact of potential disruptions, particularly in the event of a contested election and a scenario where the losing candidate fails to concede.

Support employee safety and well-being: Finally, organizations should consider providing resources that support employees\u2019 mental health and well-being, recognizing the stress and anxiety that the election period, particularly given recent events, may cause. Members of groups that may feel isolated or targeted might need special accommodation or services during this time. Organizations should also consider being prepared to implement or extend remote working policies to protect employees from potential disruptions or violence in the lead up to, during and in the immediate aftermath of November 5.\n\nBy implementing these recommendations, organizations and executives can better navigate the uncertainties of the election period, safeguard their operations and protect their employees and stakeholders from potential election-related disruptions and violence.

        "text": "Obama endorses Kamala Harris for president, solidifying Democratic support\nWashington \u2014 Former President Barack Obama endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for the Democratic presidential nomination Friday, calling her a \"happy warrior\" and vowing to do all he can to help her defeat former President Donald Trump in November.\n\nIn a video posted by her campaign, Harris takes a call from Obama and his wife, former first lady Michelle Obama.\n\n\"We called to say Michelle and I couldn't be prouder to endorse you and do everything we can to get you through this election and into the Oval Office,\" Obama tells Harris over the phone.\n\nMichelle Obama tells Harris, \"I am proud of you. This is going to be historic.\"\n\nIn the video, Harris tells them, \"this means so much to me. I am looking forward to doing this with the two of you, Doug and I both, and getting out there, being on the road. But most of all, I just wanna tell you that the words you have spoken and the friendship that you have given over all these years mean more than I can express.\"\n\nIn a separate statement sent in a campaign email, the Obamas said they agreed with President Biden that selecting Harris as his running mate was \"one of the best decisions he's made.\"\n\n\"There is no doubt in our mind that Kamala Harris has exactly what it takes to win this election and deliver for the American people,\" their statement read. \"At a time when the stakes have never been higher, she gives us all reason to hope.\"\n\nWith Obama's endorsement, Harris has secured support from all major Democrats and party leaders in Congress. Mr. Biden was the first to back his vice president, doing so soon after he announced his exit from the presidential race. He was joined in a matter of days by former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.\n\nHarris and Obama have been in regular contact since Mr. Biden announced his decision to drop out, a source familiar with the matter said, noting they have known each other for 20 years.\n\nHarris has also won the backing of Democratic governors who are considered rising stars in the party and were viewed as possible contenders to seek the party's nomination in the event of Mr. Biden's withdrawal, such as Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear.\n\nNo other Democrat has announced their candidacy for the presidential nod. Harris has secured endorsements from more than 40 state delegations, surpassing the number of delegates she will need to win the nomination. If that support holds, Democrats will officially nominate her for president during a virtual roll call vote early next month.\n\nUnder new rules adopted by the Democratic National Committee on Wednesday, the nominee will be selected as soon as Aug. 1, and the candidate, likely Harris, has until Aug. 7 to select a running mate. The party will meet for its convention in Chicago starting Aug. 19.\n\nHarris launched her presidential campaign hours after Mr. Biden announced in a letter to the American people that he would be forgoing his bid for a second term. The decision came after the president faced weeks of mounting pressure to step aside following his startling debate performance against Trump last month, which raised concerns about his fitness for a second term and ability to defeat his GOP opponent in November.\n\nIn an Oval Office address Wednesday, his first since revealing he would not seek reelection, Mr. Biden acknowledged it was time to \"pass the torch\" to a new generation of leaders.\n\n\"I believe my record as president, my leadership in the world, my vision for America's future, all merited a second term,\" he said. \"But nothing \u2014 nothing \u2014 can come in the way of saving our democracy. That includes personal ambition.\"\n\nThe president hailed Harris as \"experienced,\" \"tough\" and \"capable.\"\n\nHarris, who was a senator from California before her election as vice president, quickly hit the campaign trail with events in Wisconsin, Indiana and Texas. Her campaign said it raked in more than $100 million between Sunday afternoon, when she officially joined the White House race, and Monday evening.\n\nNidia Cavazos contributed reporting.",

        "text": "Can Harris beat Trump? Presidential prognosticator's preliminary data says yes.\nAllan Lichtman, the presidential election prognosticator who has successfully predicted the last nine out of 10 White House races, has made his preliminary projection for the November contest: Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to win, he said Friday.\n\nLichtman said his final prediction for the White House contest will come in August after the Democratic National Convention, but as of Friday, Harris appears to be the winner based on the formula he uses to forecast the election outcome.\n\nThat formula, his 13 Keys to the White House, was developed by Lichtman and renowned mathematician Vladimir Keilis-Borok in 1981. Since then, it has been used to predict the outcome of the United States presidential contests with a high success rate.\n\nLichtman uses his 13 keys, or criteria, to judge the party that controls the White House's ability to maintain control in an election year. If the White House party is considered to be a success in eight or more of the \"keys,\" then the incumbent party is expected to win. If the incumbent party is viewed as a failure in six or more of the criteria, or \"keys,\" the challenger is expected to win.\n\nLichtman broke down his rating in a recent video podcast. Here's a summary of his preliminary determination:\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nWhat \"keys\" are Harris winning?\n\nHarris, so far, has won eight of the 13 keys. Those include:\n\nKey 2 - No primary contest: Was there a significant challenger or contest to determine the nominee for the incumbent party? No. After President Joe Biden dropped out of the race on Sunday, he endorsed Harris and effectively cleared the field for her to become the presumptive nominee. No significant challengers have arisen from within the party.\n\nKey 4 - No third party: Third parties historically count against the White House party. \"They're a sign of discontent with the way the nation is being governed,\" Lichtman said. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. would need to achieve 5% of the vote to turn this key, and Lichtman says his polling ahead of November would need to stabilize at 10%. Lichtman said it's possible but unlikely that RFK Jr. could achieve those percentages.\n\nKey 5 - Strong short-term economy: No recession has been declared by the National Bureau of Economic Research so far in the election year.\n\nKey 6 - Strong long-term economy: Real economic growth in the term exceeds that of the previous two terms. \"Real\" economic growth means growth that has been adjusted for inflation, Lichtman said. \"The long-term growth under Joe Biden has been vastly greater than the average of the previous two terms,\" he said.\n\nKey 7 - Major policy change: A significant change from the previous administration or a truly historic policy change like the New Deal. \"Clearly, policy under Joe Biden in virtually every realm has been fundamentally different from that of the previous administration of Donald Trump,\" Lichtman said.\n\nKey 8 - No social unrest: \"It can't be sporadic protests like we saw this spring on some college campuses,\" Lichtman said. \"It has to be massive protests or unrest like we saw in the 1960s or during the Black Lives Matter movement when millions of people were out in the streets,\" Lichtman said this key could turn if large forms of social unrest bubble up ahead of or during the Democratic National Convention.\n\nKey 9 - No scandal: Must be some corruption directly involving the president with bipartisan recognition of the scandal as corruption, akin to Watergate.\n\nKey 13 - Uncharismatic challenger: The challenging candidate, former President Donald Trump, is not appealing to voters across party lines.\n\nWhat \"keys\" are Harris losing?",

The 2024 election is not just the most important\u2014the consequences of it are existential.\n\nAt a fundraiser in February, President Joe Biden called Donald Trump the \u201cone existential threat,\u201d and he has also written on X to constituents: \u201cIn this election, your freedom, your democracy, and America itself is at stake.\u201d Vice President Harris said at an event this month, \u201cThis is the one. The most existential, consequential, and important election of our lifetime.\u201d\n\nFormer president Trump has used this line of argument as well: At the Faith and Freedom Coalition last month, he said that \u201cthis will be the most important election in the history of our country\u201d and \u201cour one chance to save America.\u201d Back in March, he responded to the claim that he was a \u201cthreat to democracy\u201d with, \u201cI\u2019m not a threat. I\u2019m the one that\u2019s ending the threat to democracy.\u201d\n\nSign up for The Daily Briefing Get the most recent headlines and stories from Christianity Today delivered to your inbox daily.

Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again.\n\nThese talking points might be effective campaigning, but they make for a toxic political culture.\n\nIn college, I competed in policy debate tournaments\u2014a form of debate that focuses more on detailed (and fast-paced) presentation of evidence than rhetoric or performance. We created elaborate argumentative chains, showing how one policy change (subsidies for offshore wind turbines or the legalization of online gambling) could cause a cascading chain of events that nearly always ended in global nuclear war. It was a way of beating the other team: Sure, your proposal might lower inflation or decrease violent crime, but that\u2019s nothing compared to global nuclear war.\n\nOften, we spent more time debating which global extinction scenario was immediately catastrophic than we did debating the merits of the various policies that were supposed to be the topic of the debates. It sounds silly, but, this year, the same thing seems to be happening in our national politics.\n\nWe raised the stakes so high that we often sidestep substantive conversations about policy in favor of weighing apocalyptic scenarios. These existential narratives are often more about scaring people into turning out to the polls than they are about fostering dialogue about important issues.\n\nThis is where Christian theology offers a gift to our politics: an end to existential threats.\n\nFor Christians, nothing is truly a threat to our survival or existence. We are a people who believe Jesus Christ when he promised to return to his fallen creation, to wipe every tear from every eye and to make all things new. We believe that this story we are living does not end in violence, chaos, and strife\u2014it ends with perfect righteousness, justice, and peace.\n\nThe promise of Christ\u2019s return does not demand quietism or political escapism; rather, it should prompt faithful political work that can resist the impulse toward violence and injustice. If Christ is returning to make everything new, prejudiced or brutal political options become less rational, less necessary. If this election poses an existential threat, then we can more easily justify doing anything\u2014including harming our neighbors, lying, stealing, or cheating\u2014to avoid it. But if ultimate justice is promised by God, we have the freedom to seek provisional justice here on earth as faithfully as we can, without fearing that if we fail all is lost.\n\nThis is the theology that motivated some of the greatest movements for justice in our country\u2019s history. The abolitionist Maria W. Stewart was able to hold together a fierce condemnation of slavery with a deep commitment to nonviolence because the end of the story was assured: \u201cStand still, and know that the Lord he is God. Vengeance is his, and he will repay.\u201d\n\nMartin Luther King Jr., perhaps this country\u2019s most famous advocate of nonviolent resistance, was clear that this approach was not merely pragmatic but theological: \u201cThe movement [of nonviolence] was based on hope \u2026 even though the arc of the moral universe is long, it bends toward justice.\u201d\n\nThere has been a lot of talk lately about lowering the heat of our political rhetoric, a recognition that when the issues seem so paramount, we risk reacting with violence. But this wise counsel needs a stronger theological backing.\n\nThe threats, after all, are not imagined or entirely exaggerated. The consequences of this election will be serious, and likely in ways we do not yet know. Lowering the stakes in the face of these threats might diminish the real significance of elections: They shape people\u2019s lives, especially the most vulnerable. It risks communicating to people that politics doesn\u2019t really matter that much, that the human lives that will be affected by the outcome are not worthy of our attention.\n\nBut lowering the stakes because we believe that the end of the Christian story is true is another thing altogether. Lowering the stakes because ultimate justice is not at risk in this election opens up greater opportunities for meaningful change here and now.\n\nTo many in our nation, it feels like the options are between living in a constant state of existential threat and checking out of politics entirely. I\u2019ve heard many bemoan on social media, \u201cCan\u2019t we just live in precedented times?\u201d or \u201cHow many historical events do I have to live through?\u201d We constantly hear that the fate of our country is at stake in this election, but raising the stakes hasn\u2019t seemed to inspire more political involvement.\n\nThe comment I hear most frequently from people in churches and schools across the country is that the fear and anger have exhausted them, tempting them toward total political apathy. We are bombarded with information about the great injustices and evils in the world, alarmed by the conditions of our own political culture, and we feel helpless to do anything about it.\n\nEither we constantly scroll social media for updates on the latest sign of impending political doom, sign up for every political group in town, and take every opportunity to convince our friends and family members about these existential threats\u2014or we throw up our hands, declare the whole political system unfixable, and live in blissful ignorance of the folks who will be more directly affected by the policies we can\u2019t be bothered to research. However, there is an alternative to these options.\n\nAll of these claims\u2014of existential threat, of \u201cliving in historic times,\u201d of democracy teetering on the edge of disaster\u2014are claims about where we sit in history, and what agency that position allows us. If this is the defining moment of history, we should act differently than we would under normal conditions. If democracy is on the ballot, nothing else really matters. If this candidate or party will end our very existence, political options to persuade or negotiate are off the table. All that\u2019s left is to destroy or be destroyed.\n\nBut the Christian story says that we are not awaiting the impending turning point of history from goodness to chaos. The Christian story says that the defining point of history has already happened: the resurrection of Jesus Christ. In light of that victory over the powers and principalities, and in hopeful anticipation of his return to bring that victory to consummation, we have opportunities to effect change in our fallen world. The resurrection of Christ is the horizon of our agency, the event that defines the possibilities for creative and faithful work.\n\nOne of the most frequent biblical themes is that it is not the powerful and important whose actions most matter but the lowly, forgotten, and small. In a political culture that feels hopeless, in a system we feel powerless to change, Scripture offers us stories of surprising agency: of three men who survive a fire when they stand down an idolatrous king, of midwives who save the lives of infants, of a man on a cross who dies a gruesome death but then rises from the grave.\n\nIn the face of an onslaught of existential threats, Christians can proclaim to the world that our options are not between apathy or political violence (Rom. 12:18\u201320).\n\nFreed from the constraints of existential politics and motivated for change, new possibilities appear. We can fight for justice, advocate for the oppressed, and seek flourishing in our own neighborhoods without worrying that if our candidate loses or our advocacy fails it means that our very existence is threatened. And we might just discover that politics has all kinds of places for fruitful work that we previously ignored in our rush to stave off the biggest existential threat.\n\nChristian political action can be bringing a casserole to a neighbor, showing up to a city council meeting, setting up an apartment for a refugee family, writing a letter to an elected official. Within the frame of God\u2019s redemptive story, these small acts of justice and peace take on greater significance than the desperate attempts to bring peace to earth at any cost.\n\nKaitlyn Schiess is the author of The Ballot and the Bible: How Scripture Has Been Used and Abused in American Politics and Where We Go from Here.",

        "text": "US Presidential elections: Barack and Michelle Obama endorse Kamala Harris, giving her expected but crucial support\nFormer President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama have endorsed Kamala Harris in her White House bid, giving the vice president the expected but still crucial backing of the nation\u2019s two most popular Democrats.\n\nThe endorsement, announced Friday morning in a video showing Harris accepting a joint phone call from the former first couple, comes as Harris continues to build momentum as the party\u2019s likely nominee after President Joe Biden\u2019s decision to end his reelection bid and endorse his second-in-command against Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump.\n\nIt also highlights the friendship and potentially historic link between the nation\u2019s first Black president and the first woman, first Black woman and first person of Asian descent to serve as vice president, who is now vying to break those same barriers at the presidential rank.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso Read | Kamala Harris is as African American as Indian American\n\n\u201cWe called to say Michelle and I couldn\u2019t be prouder to endorse you and do everything we can to get you through this election and into the Oval Office,\u201d the former president told Harris, who is shown taking the call as she walks backstage at an event, trailed by a Secret Service agent.\n\nSaid Michelle Obama, \u201cI can\u2019t have this phone call without saying to my girl, Kamala, I am proud of you.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be historic,\u201d she added.\n\nHarris, who has known the Obamas since before his election in 2008, thanked them for their friendship and said she looks forward to \u201cgetting there, being on the road\u201d with them in the three-month blitz before Election Day on Nov. 5.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna have some fun with this too, aren\u2019t we?\u201d Harris said.\n\nI\u2019m so proud of my girl, Kamala. Barack and I are so excited to endorse her as the Democratic nominee because of her positivity, sense of humor, and ability to bring light and hope to people all across the country. We\u2019ve got your back, @KamalaHarris! pic.twitter.com/xldcZeDXuS \u2014 Michelle Obama (@MichelleObama) July 26, 2024\n\nThe Obamas are perhaps the last major party figures to endorse Harris formally \u2014 a reflection of the former president\u2019s desire to remain, at least publicly, a party elder operating above the fray. The Obamas remain prodigious fundraising draws and popular surrogates at large campaign events for Democratic candidates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to an Associated Press survey, Harris already has secured the public support of a majority of delegates to the Democratic National Convention, which begins Aug. 19 in Chicago. The Democratic National Committee expects to hold a virtual nominating vote that would, by Aug. 7, make Harris and a yet-to-be-named running mate the official Democratic ticket.\n\nBiden endorsed Harris within an hour of announcing his decision last Sunday to end his campaign amid widespread concern about the 81-year-old president\u2019s ability to defeat Trump. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, House Minority Whip Jim Clyburn, former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton followed in the days after.\n\nThe Obamas, however, trod carefully as Harris secured the delegate commitments, made the rounds among core Democratic constituencies and raised more than $120 million. The public caution tracks how the former president handled the weeks between Biden\u2019s debate debacle against Trump and the president\u2019s eventual decision to end his campaign: Obama was a certain presence in the party\u2019s maneuvers but he operated quietly.\n\nBarack Obama\u2019s initial statement after Biden\u2019s announcement did not mention Harris. Instead, he spoke generically about coming up with a nominee to succeed Biden: \u201cI have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges,\u201d the former president wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth Obamas campaigned separately for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Biden in 2020, including large rallies on the closing weekends before Election Day. They delivered key speeches at the Democrats\u2019 convention in 2020, a virtual event because of the coronavirus pandemic. The former president\u2019s speech was especially notable because he unveiled a full-throated attack on Trump as a threat to democracy, an argument that endures as part of Harris\u2019 campaign.",

As a nation, we have become so used to the endless campaign that it has become virtually impossible to imagine that there could be any period of time free from intense electioneering.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s withdrawal from the 2024 election and Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019s rapid ascent have raised concerns as to whether Democrats can run a successful campaign in only three months. As a nation, we have become so used to the endless campaign that it has become virtually impossible to imagine that there could be any period of time free from intense electioneering.\n\nBut the unusual circumstances of 2024 give the nation an opportunity to test the status quo and see whether a shorter, more targeted campaign might actually be a more effective path toward victory\u2014and simultaneously healthier for the democracy.\n\nAmerican presidential elections are much longer than in other countries. Many nations have laws on the books that strictly curtail how long campaigns can be.\n\nLess well known is the fact that American elections were not always this long, either. In 1896, Republican William McKinley famously campaigned from the front porch of his home in Ohio and won election as president. Although candidates would compete in primaries since their advent in the early 20th century, most only did a handful, if any, and they were only testing grounds for the summer party conventions where the machine would select the nominee. In 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson didn\u2019t even file in the New Hampshire primary.\n\nThe duration of the presidential campaign cycle has vastly expanded since the early 1970s. Political reform following the tumultuous 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago was an important factor behind the change. Democrats were shaken as anti-war protesters clashed with party leaders over the disastrous conflict in Vietnam. Violent confrontations unfolded on the streets where Mayor Richard J. Daley\u2019s police attacked protesters with brutal force.\n\nRather than allowing party operatives to keep picking the nominees in smoke-filled rooms, Sen. George McGovern and Rep. Donald Fraser successfully proposed reforms that made primaries, as well as caucuses, the contests in which voters would determine who sat atop the ticket. And when former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter figured out in 1976 how to use the Iowa caucus as a way to build the perception of being a front-runner, the official kick-off for presidential campaigns became January of election year. Republicans embraced the McGovern-Fraser reforms and moved away from party machines as well. Very quickly, candidates started to prepare even earlier as they wanted to make sure to do well in Iowa as well as the New Hampshire primary so as to receive the boost of an early victory.\n\nBut there was more at work than the nomination process. Money mattered as well. In the aftermath of Watergate, reformers attempted to curb the growing influence of money in elections. In 1974, Congress passed reforms that created contribution limits, a system of voluntary public finance for presidential elections (if a presidential candidate accepted public funds, they had to adhere to spending limits), spending limitations, more stringent disclosure rules, and a Federal Elections Commission.\n\nBut the reforms failed to stop the escalating costs of elections. In particular, television spots placed enormous pressure on candidates\u2019 budgets. By 2020, presidential and congressional elections cost a whopping $14 billion. The amount spent was greater than the GDPs of some smaller countries. Moreover, the Watergate reforms gradually weakened. In 1976, the Supreme Court knocked down spending limitations on the grounds that they violated free speech. Parties found ways to obtain money through political action committees and nonprofit entities while presidential candidates from the major parties decided not to accept public funds so that they could spend as much private money as they wanted to.\n\nSome candidates and consultants half-joked that presidential campaigns usually started the minute after an inauguration ended.\n\nThere was another reason why television worked to lengthen the duration of campaigns. In the 1980s, cable networks formed that were devoted entirely to news (CNN launched in 1980, MSNBC and Fox News started in 1996). In contrast to the era of network news, when the 30-minute evening news shows were sandwiched between daytime soap operas and prime-time variety shows, these channels offered a continuous stream of news. The networks made their money through advertising, so they looked for stories that could garner high viewership. The horse-race coverage of political campaigns offered perfect content, providing the thrill of a sporting event with much higher stakes. Over time, and combined with the internet and then social media, permanent news outlets craved campaign stories to fill the airwaves. Short breaking news segments, town halls, one-on-one interviews, and 60- to 90-minute debates were constant and became requirements for serious candidates.\n\nWith all of these forces coming together, the American presidential campaign\u2014usually much longer than what occurred overseas\u2014grew even lengthier.\n\nThere have been significant consequences, many detrimental. Perhaps most important is the creation of an endless money cycle. Candidates start campaigns earlier to raise money, while the longer a campaign takes the more money needs to be spent. The permanent campaign likewise ensures that electoral pressures will place constant and intense pressure on every deliberation that takes place in Washington. There are no moments when electoral pressures ebb to create more space for sober policymaking. Elected officials and their challengers can never afford to take their eyes off the hustings.\n\nThen there is the problem of voter fatigue. In July 2016, 59 percent of voters reported feeling exhausted by election coverage, with the numbers even worse among those who weren\u2019t following as closely. Some respond by simply tuning out.\n\nThe possibility of obtaining any kind of change through reform is unlikely. There is not much evidence, for instance, that serious consideration would be given to enacting laws limiting how long a candidate can campaign for, nor would such laws be likely to survive constitutional challenge. It would also be difficult for the political parties to move away from a system built around primaries and caucuses back to something like what we had before 1968. Even the speed through which Harris secured her candidacy has caused concern of an undemocratic \u201ccoronation\u201d taking place. The odds for substantive campaign finance reform are low, and the 24-hour news media only keeps getting more entrenched. When some experts have proposed combining more primaries and caucuses in Super Tuesday-style days, there has been resistance from states that prefer to drag out the process.\n\nThis is why Harris\u2019s campaign is so interesting. Should Harris be able to put together an effective campaign in a few months and defeat former President Donald Trump, she has the potential to demonstrate in practice that a shorter campaign is not only possible but perhaps more effective in our current age.\n\nThe question on the table is whether, in a period when the public is so inundated with political news, there might be something strategically effective in concentrating the amount of time devoted to the meat of the campaign. In an era with so much content\u2014from entertainment to politics\u2014a more dramatic, attenuated campaign period could garner the kind of public attention that longer elections fail to achieve. With a shorter time frame, perhaps elections become the kind of focusing events that engage and excite voters, rather than something from which they tune out. A faster and more nimble campaign might also make it harder for opponents to develop sustained smear attacks that build over time. Ideally, in the long run, shorter campaigns could decrease the amount of time candidates who are elected officials spend on fundraising, as opposed to governing. Obviously, it might also be that the short campaign is not effective. Certainly, a victory by Trump in November would lead Democrats to that very conclusion, as they will blame Biden for waiting so long before handing over the keys.\n\nRegardless, the unusual and unprecedented nature of this contest should be an opportunity for Americans to have a serious conversation about whether our campaigns really need to be, and should be, as lengthy as they have become\u2014or whether our democracy would benefit from a campaign cycle that is succinct, lean, concentrated, and not unending. Sometimes in life, shorter is better. Maybe our democracy can benefit from a little less, rather than more and more.",

        "text": "Kamala Harris makes history as whirlwind week upends US election\nThe telephone line was a little fuzzy, and the voice on the end gravelly from several days of Covid isolation. Yet the poignancy of the message, and the moment itself, could not have been clearer: \u201cI\u2019m watching you, kid. I love you,\u201d the speaker said.\n\nJoe Biden\u2019s warmhearted call to his vice-president, Kamala Harris, at the Democratic party\u2019s campaign headquarters in Delaware on Monday marked a generational shift in US politics, a symbolic passing of the torch from parent to progeny.\n\nIn terms of the 2024 presidential election race it was also a defining moment. Harris, a former prosecutor, state attorney general, California senator, and for three and a half years the 81-year-old Biden\u2019s White House understudy, was appearing for the first time as her party\u2019s preferred new candidate, less than 24 hours after her boss\u2019s stunning announcement that he would not seek a second term of office sent a seismic shock across the country.\n\nThere followed what by any metric could be called a whirlwind week on the campaign trail in an extraordinary month in American history already notable for the attempted assassination of former president Donald Trump, the Republican party\u2019s candidate for the 5 November election.\n\nBy Wednesday, Harris was addressing an historically Black sorority in Indianapolis as the Democratic presumptive nominee, having secured the support of enough delegates at the party\u2019s national convention in Chicago next month to clinch the nomination.\n\nIt was the same day as Biden gave an emotional, nationally televised address from the White House explaining his decision to step aside \u201cin defense of democracy\u201d.\n\n\u201cI revere this office, but I love my country more,\u201d he said, urging the country to stand behind Harris.\n\nOne by one, other heavyweight Democratic figures had stepped up to endorse her, culminating on Friday with the outsized backing of Barack Obama. The former speaker Nancy Pelosi, Hillary Clinton, all 23 of the party\u2019s state governors, and elected officials from the most junior Congress members to Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer, respectively the House minority leader and Senate majority leader, also gave their approval.\n\n\u201cWe are not playing around,\u201d Harris told supporters at the sorority gathering in Indiana on Wednesday.\n\nView image in fullscreen Kamala Harris and the second gentleman, Douglas Emhoff, kiss onstage at Harris\u2019s presidential campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, on Tuesday. Photograph: Erin Schaff/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cThere is so much at stake in this moment. Our nation, as it always has, is counting on you to energize, to organize, and to mobilize; to register folks to vote, to get them to the polls; and to continue to fight for the future our nation and her people deserve.\n\n\u201cWe know when we organize, mountains move. When we mobilize, nations change. And when we vote, we make history.\u201d\n\nIt was a rousing speech from a politician who only three days previously was still in a supporting role, despite weeks of swirling speculation about Biden\u2019s future following his disastrous debate performance against Trump in June.\n\nBut things moved swiftly once the president\u2019s decision to step aside was announced on Sunday afternoon. The Biden campaign apparatus, and election war chest of almost $100m (\u00a377.6m), became the property of a new entity called Harris for President (Republicans have vowed to challenge the funds transfer in court).\n\nAnd staff hastily drew up a new travel schedule for the vice-president, which saw her crisscrossing the country, including the Wilmington, Delaware, appearance on Monday, at which she acknowledged the \u201crollercoaster\u201d of the previous 24 hours.\n\nOn Tuesday, she was rallying in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, with the campaign message: \u201cWe\u2019re not going back\u201d to the \u201cchaos\u201d of the Trump years.\n\nView image in fullscreen Kamala Harris speaks to supporters during a campaign rally in West Allis, Wisconsin, on Tuesday. Photograph: Jim Vondruska/Getty Images\n\nOn Wednesday, to Black women in Indianapolis, Indiana, she said: \u201cWe face a choice between two different visions for our nation: one focused on the future, the other focused on the past.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, she told teachers in Houston, Texas: \u201cIn our vision, we see a place where every person has the opportunity not just to get by, but to get ahead.\u201d\n\nAlso on Thursday came her first meeting with a foreign leader \u2013 Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu \u2013 in her own right as a presidential candidate, not in a joint summit as vice-president. In a White House statement issued in her name, not Biden\u2019s, Harris condemned violence at Wednesday\u2019s anti-Netanyahu protest in Washington DC and the burning of the US flag.\n\nIn forceful public remarks following the meeting , she also went further than Biden ever had to criticize civilian suffering in Gaza. \u201cI will not be silent,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIsrael has a right to defend itself \u2026 [but] we cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering.\u201d\n\nActivities behind the scenes, meanwhile, progressed every bit as quickly as Harris\u2019s front-of-house appearances.\n\nFundraising operations cranked up, pulling in an all-time record $81m for any 24-hour period in presidential campaign history, a windfall for the newly branded Harris Victory Fund that surpassed $130m, mostly from small or first-time donors, by Thursday night.\n\nSeizing on enthusiasm from younger voters that polling found was conspicuously absent for Biden, or the 78-year-old Trump, Harris\u2019s team also released to social media its first campaign video. Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s 2016 hit Freedom, the unofficial anthem of Harris for President, provided the soundtrack for a message countering what it says was Trump\u2019s \u201cchaos, fear and hate\u201d vision for the country.\n\nView image in fullscreen People raise signs in support of Kamala Harris as she speaks at a campaign event at West Allis high school in West Allis, Wisconsin, on Tuesday. Photograph: Kevin Mohatt/Reuters\n\nHarris has enormous appeal with generation Z, noted by backing from numerous youth organizations, including March for Our Lives, the student activist group formed in the aftermath of the 2018 mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida.\n\nThere could have been no better illustration than the declaration on X/Twitter by the British singer Charli xcx that \u201ckamala IS brat\u201d. Viewed by more than 53 million people, the simple message encapsulating a pop culture lifestyle delighted the younger generation and confounded their elders in equal measure. \u201cYou just got to go listen to that Charli xcx album and then you\u2019ll understand it,\u201d Florida\u2019s Maxwell Frost, the first gen Z member of Congress, told CNN.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s coconut trees or talking about brat or whatever, the message is getting across to tens of millions of young people across the entire country, and across the entire world, and that\u2019s really inspiring.\u201d\n\nWrongfooted by Biden\u2019s abrupt exit, and alarmed by polls showing Harris gaining ground or even surpassing Trump in popularity, the former president\u2019s campaign scrambled to find attack lines for their new opponent.\n\nAt a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Wednesday, Trump tested insults including calling Harris a \u201cradical left lunatic\u201d and \u201cthe most incompetent and far-left vice-president in American history\u201d. Republican party acolytes have also been busy with racist attacks, accusing Harris, who has Black and Asian heritage, of being \u201ca DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] hire\u201d or \u201cunqualified\u201d for the presidency.\n\nView image in fullscreen Kamala Harris, walking left, waves as she arrives to speak during the American Federation of Teachers\u2019 88th national convention in Houston on Thursday. Photograph: Tony Gutierrez/AP\n\nExperts warn to expect an all-out attack of misogyny and racism on Harris as the election approaches.\n\nThis week, however, while Harris\u2019s fledgling campaign took its first steps, it was sharpening its own knives. Framing the upcoming campaign as \u201cthe prosecutor versus the felon\u201d, it took swipes at Trump\u2019s 34 felony convictions on fraud charges, and in a searing missive on Thursday mocked the former president\u2019s rambling anti-Harris diatribe on a rightwing news channel by issuing a \u201cstatement on a 78-year-old criminal\u2019s Fox News appearance\u201d. The gloves are off.\n\nNow, with the first full, buoyant week of Harris\u2019s presidential challenge about to be in the history books, the question is whether the initial enthusiasm and momentum can be maintained through the gruelling 101 days left until the election.\n\nHarris and her team are confident it can. Contradicting the statement by the liberal British politician Joseph Chamberlain more than a century ago that \u201cin politics, there is no use looking beyond the next fortnight\u201d, they have their sights set not only on November\u2019s election, but the eight years beyond it.",

        "text": "July 27, 2024, presidential campaign news\nRepublican presidential nominee and former U.S. President Donald Trump gestures during a rally in St. Cloud, Minnesota, on July 27. Carlos Osorio/Reuters\n\nFormer President Donald Trump painted his new chief rival, Kamala Harris, as worse than President Joe Biden at a Saturday night rally, calling her \u201cthe most incompetent, unpopular and far-left vice president in American history.\u201d\n\nMoments into his remarks in St. Cloud, Minnesota, Trump again blamed a deadly rocket attack in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights earlier in the day on the \u201cincompetent Biden-Harris administration.\u201d\n\nHe then quickly pivoted to Harris, calling her the \u201cborder czar,\u201d as Republicans have been hammering the presumptive Democratic nominee over how she has handled her task of stemming the root causes of migration. \u201cShe\u2019s terrible. She\u2019s worse \u2026 she\u2019s worse than he is,\u201d Trump said of Harris and Biden.\n\nTrump compared Biden to a fighter who was \u201cbadly beaten\u201d and taken out of the fight.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s losing. Then, they took him out of the fight, and they put in a new fighter. We have a new victim now, Kamala, we have a new victim. We have a brand-new victim. And honestly, she\u2019s a radical left-wing person,\u201d he said, later reiterating his accusation that Democrats staged a \u201ccoup\u201d as Biden stepped aside and endorsed Harris.\n\nTrump continued upon earlier remarks by his running mate, JD Vance, as he slammed Harris\u2019 political record, saying that she \u201cdestroyed San Francisco\u201d as county district attorney.\n\n\u201cA crazy liberal like Kamala Harris gets in, the American dream is dead,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump went after Harris on topics that included abortion, gun policy, climate change, entitlement programs and inflation. In a less substantive dig, he also mocked Harris\u2019 laugh, claiming that the media was trying to portray her as a \u201cMargaret Thatcher,\u201d referring to the late British prime minister, but that \u201cit\u2019s not gonna happen,\u201d because \u201cMargaret Thatcher didn\u2019t laugh like that.\u201d\n\nThough Trump still did partake in his usual mocking of Biden, including by imitating the president playing golf, he acknowledged that the hits weren\u2019t as effective now that Biden had dropped out of the race.\n\nTrump also drew a contrast between himself and Harris by recalling the racial justice protests in 2020 after the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis.\n\n\u201cEvery voter in Minnesota needs to know that when the violent mobs of anarchists and looters and Marxists came to burn down Minneapolis four years ago. \u2026 Remember me? I couldn\u2019t get your governor to act,\u201d he said, again falsely claiming that he, not Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, activated the National Guard in response to the protests.\n\n\u201cI sent in the National Guard to save Minneapolis, while Kamala Harris sided with the arsonists and rioters and raised money to bail out the criminals,\u201d he said, referring to a 2020 tweet from Harris encouraging donations to bail out protesters. The fund, in addition to other charitable bail groups, later came under fire after some defendants who were bailed out were arrested for alleged acts of violence.\n\nThe Harris campaign released a statement shortly after Trump\u2019s speech concluded, blasting the Republican nominee as \u201ca bitter, unhinged, 78-year-old convicted felon.\u201d\n\nSpokesperson Sarafina Chitika said Trump \u201ckept clinging to his lies about the 2020 election he lost being \u2018rigged,\u2019 rambled about his former opponent and golfing, and made excuses for why he\u2019s afraid to debate Vice President Harris.\u201d",

        "text": "Kamala Harris: Three ways Donald Trump will try to end the honeymoon\nThree ways Trump is trying to end the Harris honeymoon\n\nRelive a wild month in US politics in about two minutes\n\nAt a moment of unprecedented turbulence in modern American political history, Kamala Harris is having a remarkably smooth ride. It may not last long. Tony Fabrizio, Donald Trump\u2019s campaign pollster, calls it a \u201cHarris Honeymoon\u201d \u2013 where a combination of good press and positive energy have combined to give the Democrat a surge of momentum. The thing about honeymoons, of course, is that they come to an end. The realities of married life, or in this case the relationship between Ms Harris and the American voting public, has a way of reasserting itself. For now, the champagne corks are flying for team Harris and Democrats may be experiencing an unfamiliar emotion \u2013 hope. But Republicans, after initially being caught somewhat flatfooted by Mr Biden\u2019s historic announcement, are redirecting their fire at the new presumptive nominee. Here\u2019s a look at three areas on which their recent attacks have focused \u2013 and some ways Democrats may try to deflect them.\n\n1. Calling Harris a 'radical' leftist\n\nThe travails of Ms Harris\u2019 unsuccessful campaign for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination are well documented. They include a lack of clear messaging, a campaign rife with internal discord and a candidate who was prone to awkward interviews and gaffes. Something else happened during the then-senator\u2019s ill-fated presidential bid, however. She \u2013 like many of the candidates in that race \u2013 tacked sharply to the left, to be more in line with Democratic primary voters. \u201cThere was a lot of pressure on those guys from the activist base,\u201d said Matt Bennett, the executive vice-president for public affairs at Third Way, a centrist Democratic think tank. \u201cWhen you\u2019re competing in a primary, your political priorities are very different than the sprint to the finish in a general election.\u201d Over the course of 2019 \u2013 in debates and interviews - Ms Harris endorsed scrapping private health insurance for a government-run system. She praised policing reform, including redirecting law-enforcement budgets to other priorities. She endorsed decriminalising undocumented entry into the US and entertained abolishing Ice, the immigration and customs enforcement agency. She backed the sweeping Green New Deal environmental legislation and supported a ban on fracking and off-shore drilling. Now those positions could come back to haunt her.\n\nGetty Images Harris seen at a presidential primary debate in 2019, alongside Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden\n\nDavid McCormick, a Republican candidate for Senate in Pennsylvania, was quick to produce a television advertisement hitting on Ms Harris\u2019 2019 positions and tying them to his opponent, Democratic Senator Bob Casey. And Trump has released a video titled \"MEET SAN FRANCISCO RADICAL KAMALA HARRIS\" that includes many of the policies she backed during that time. Conservative commentator Matt Walsh called it a \u201cblueprint\u201d for how to attack the vice-president. \u201cShe can argue, correctly, that good leaders change their position on policy and they don\u2019t change her principles,\u201d Mr Bennett, the Democratic strategist, said. \u201cNone of her principles have changed.\u201d If she doesn\u2019t do that convincingly, she could lose support from independent and undecided voters that will determine the outcome of the election in key swing states.\n\n2. Tying Harris to Biden's record\n\nPolls show the Biden campaign had been floundering for months. His immigration policies were unpopular. Even though inflation has eased and the economy is growing, voters still blamed him for higher prices. His ongoing support for Israel in the Gaza War was sapping his support among young voters. Ms Harris, in her role as vice-president, will at least be somewhat tied to the entirety of the current administration\u2019s record \u2013 for better or for worse. Republicans are already trying to hang the immigration issue around her neck, labelling her as the administration\u2019s \u201cborder czar\u201d \u2013 an inaccurate but damaging characterisation that was also used by the media. They cite her past statements on immigration and a claim, during an interview in 2022, that the \u201cborder is secure\u201d. \u201cKamala Harris is currently only known as a failed and unpopular vice-president who knifed her boss in the back to secure a nomination she couldn\u2019t earn, but voters are about to learn, it gets worse,\u201d Taylor Budowich, who runs the political action committee affiliated with the Trump campaign, said in a statement touting $32m in upcoming television advertisements targeting the vice-president.\n\nGetty Images Migrant arrivals and detentions are down after historic highs earlier in Biden's term\n\nAccording to Mr Bennett, Ms Harris won\u2019t be able to fully distance herself from the Biden record, but she might be able to put it in new light for voters, even in the face of Republican attacks. \u201cWhat she can do is make this about the future in ways that were going to be very difficult for an 81-year-old guy to do,\u201d he says. \u201cShe can argue that Trump wants only to look backward.\u201d\n\n3. Attacking her years as a prosecutor\n\nIn the first public rally of her presidential campaign, Ms Harris unveiled a particularly pointed line of attack against the former president. Noting that she had served as a courtroom prosecutor and as California\u2019s attorney general, she said she had faced off against \u201cperpetrators of all kinds\u201d. \u201cSo hear me when I say I know Donald Trump\u2019s type,\u201d she concluded. Craig Varoga, a Democratic campaign consultant and adjunct instructor at American University, calls the vice-president\u2019s law-enforcement background her \u201csuperpower\u201d \u2013 one that she was not fully able to use on the Democratic campaign trail in 2019, when policing reform was a top issue. But Trump's campaign is already showing signs on how they might respond. His campaign manager, Chris LaCivita, made his bones in the Republican Party by taking on another Democratic candidate\u2019s supposed superpower and turning it against him. Back in 2004, Democratic nominee John Kerry was touting his record as a decorated Vietnam War veteran as proof that he would be an effective commander-in-chief during the Iraq War. Mr LaCivita spearheaded a series of attack adverts questioning Mr Kerry\u2019s patriotism and heroism, featuring sailors who served with Kerry on a Navy swift boat patrolling the rivers and shorelines in Vietnam. It gave rise to the term \u201cSwift-boating\u201d \u2013 which means to disarm a candidate by attacking their perceived strength. And it looks like Trump's campaign is gearing up for attacks on the vice-president's prosecutorial record. On one hand, they are hitting her for being too tough \u2013 particularly on black men for drug crimes \u2013 in an attempt to undermine support from her base. On the other, they are citing instances where Ms Harris either chose not to prosecute or allowed the parole of individuals who went on to commit new crimes. Mr Varoga concedes that Democrats botched their response to the Swift-boat attacks in 2004, but he says they\u2019ve learned their lesson and Ms Harris will be ready for the onslaught. \u201cIf LaCivita thinks he\u2019s going to fool the entire Democratic establishment again, he can live with that delusion and also lose,\u201d he said.\n\nA race to define Harris\n\nIn his memo, Mr Fabrizio said that Ms Harris \u201ccan\u2019t change who she is or what she\u2019s done\u201d. He promised that voters will soon view her as Mr Biden\u2019s \u201cpartner and co-pilot\u201d and learn about her \u201cdangerously liberal record\u201d. The upcoming advertising onslaught, along with Trump\u2019s public statements and rally attacks, will be the tip of this Republican spear. Meanwhile, Ms Harris and her campaign will work to offer their own definition of who the candidate is and what she stands for. One particularly effective way to do this, according to Mr Varoga, is with her selection of a vice-presidential running mate. \u201cIt\u2019s the first real decision that a candidate for president makes that\u2019s out there for the public to see,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will go a long way toward people understanding what kind of future she\u2019s going to pursue.\u201d",

        "text": "Trump shooting: Thomas Crooks' plan and the botched security\nTrump shooting: The plan and the botched security\n\nGetty Images Secret service agents surround Trump after Crooks' shot grazes his ear\n\nThomas Matthew Crooks walked into Donald Trump's election rally in Pennsylvania, unopposed with a gun, explosives and a rangefinder to measure distance to his target. The aftermath of the 13 July shooting reveals a detailed plan hatched in the days before - and a series of security failings that allowed its execution. Three congressional hearings were held this week with the head of the FBI, the Secret Service's director and Pennsylvania's state police chief. Here is what those hearings have added to what is known about the attempt on Trump's life, what went wrong, and important unanswered questions.\n\nThe preparation\n\nIt is becoming clear that Crooks' attack was not the result of a last-minute meltdown: He had method, and purpose. The FBI has said that 6 July appeared to be the inception date: Crooks registered to attend Trump's rally, and researched the assassination of President John F Kennedy, googling: \"How far away was Oswald from Kennedy?\" \"That's a search that's obviously significant in terms of his state of mind,\" Christopher Wray, the FBI's director, told the House Judiciary committee on Wednesday. He added that searches by Crooks then became \"focused\" on Trump. He was working alone - the FBI say they do not think he received any help. There was also reconnaissance. Mr Wray said Crooks was flying a drone about 200 yards (183m) from the stage two hours before Trump's rally. Its camera ran for about 11 minutes, Mr Wray said, and the footage would have shown \"a rear-view mirror of the scene\" behind Crooks' eventual firing position.\n\nMr Wray said that Crooks had bought an AR-15-style rifle from his father, legally, although he did not say when. The gun had a collapsible stock, making it easier to conceal. State police officers reported him using a rangefinder, a marksman's aid that measures distance to a target, as the rally got under way. Crooks had also obtained explosives: two \"crude\" devices fitted with receivers were found in Crooks' car after the attack, Mr Wray said, and a transmitter was found on his body. A bloodied receipt was also found on Crooks for a 5ft ladder, Mr Wray said - suggesting a recent buy. No ladder was found at the site, however, and Mr Wray said Crooks had used \"mechanical equipment\" to get to his perch - but did not elaborate. And so Crooks turned up on the day with a concealable rifle, knowledge of previous assassinations, a rangefinder, two bombs, and detailed information on the layout of the area.\n\nA plan in action\n\nIt should be impossible for a man to walk into a presidential rally with so much gear, let alone carry it up to an undefended roof with a direct line of sight to the stage. But this is exactly what happened in Butler. Statements to the House Homeland Security committee by Pennsylvania's police commissioner, Christopher Paris, convey a series of lapses from law enforcement. The venue had two layers of security - an outer area patrolled by state police and an inner perimeter manned by Secret Service agents, including an anti-sniper team on a roof behind the stage. An operations centre was staffed by members of the various agencies present. But on the day, communication was haphazard and areas of responsibility unclear. Mr Paris told his hearing that state police were responsible for the area around the AGR International warehouse, the building from which Crooks fired that was around 400ft (122m) from the stage with a clear line of sight. He revealed his men had raised its risk in the days before the rally and were told by the Secret Service that it was a state police matter as it was in the outer area. As a consequence, a local SWAT-style Emergency Services Unit (ESU) team was stationed inside the building complex, Mr Paris added. The New York Times reported that the team was in fact two men who stayed inside because of the hot weather. The plan had been approved by the Secret Service, the newspaper's source said. Kimberly Cheatle, director of the Secret Service until she stepped down this week, told lawmakers she could not account for why no one was stationed on the roof.\n\nGetty Images Armed police react after Crooks shoots at Trump\n\nWhat went wrong?\n\nMr Paris said the first sighting of Crooks came from a state police ESU unit. Unlike others in the crowd, Crooks was walking around and did not try to enter the venue, he said. \"Crooks never made it through the secure perimeter.\" He was not challenged. Mr Paris said he was one of three people flagged as \"suspicious\" at this point in the event. About 25 minutes before the rally began, however, Mr Paris said that the ESU team spotted him again - this time using his rangefinder, though no gun was reported. This is perhaps the point where security broke down irrevocably. A photograph of Crooks was sent by a member of the ESU team to a state trooper in the joint operations room. Mr Paris said that a Secret Service liaison asked the trooper to send the photo to another number. At this point, it seems that agents charged with protecting Trump did not consider Crooks dangerous enough to act - no weapon had been spotted. During her fractious hearing before the House Oversight committee on Monday, Ms Cheatle acknowledged her agents were told about Crooks at least twice before the shooting began. She said that agents only became aware of the gravity of the threat \"seconds before the gunfire started\".\n\nThe crucial moments\n\nMr Paris said several local police, including the ESU team, then began searching for Crooks. It appears he was lost again, despite his growing threat. Witnesses told the BBC that by this point they had seen a man with a gun crawling along a roof. All of this was happening with Trump already on stage. Mr Paris said that Crooks was eventually seen on the roof by local traffic police and his ESU team. One traffic officer boosted up to the roof by a colleague was forced to fall back after being confronted by Crooks, Mr Paris told the hearing. That confrontation, the commissioner said, happened \"a matter of seconds\" before the shooting. Agents surrounded Trump immediately after the first shots, and he was off the stage within two minutes. By this point Crooks had been shot dead by a sniper. A video recorded on the roof about an hour after the attack shows snipers and Secret Service agents trying to understand who saw what and when, adding to the sense of confusion among law enforcement. Eight bullet casings were found near his body. He had killed one crowd member and injured two others. Amid speculation over whether Trump was actually hit by a bullet, the FBI confirmed two weeks afterwards that the Republican was indeed wounded by a round from the suspect's weapon. The agency said in a statement: \"What struck former President Trump in the ear was a bullet, whether whole or fragmented into smaller pieces, fired from the deceased subject\u2019s rifle.\"\n\nGetty Images Cheatle quit a day after facing Congress and providing few answers\n\nWhy was Trump allowed on stage?\n\nTrump was on stage for around 10 minutes between the moment Crooks was spotted on the roof with a gun and the moment he fired his first shot. There is almost no public account of the Secret Service's actions and decisions during the rally. Ms Cheatle declined to answer most of the questions put to her in Congress - down to how many agents were protecting Trump. We do know, via Ms Cheatle, that agents dismissed the alerts about him because he was not seen with a weapon. She could not provide her hearing a detailed timeline, as requested, saying she \"did not have specifics\". She quit as director of the Secret Service a day after her hearing, under pressure from both sides of the House, and it seems we won't get answers any time soon.\n\nWhat was Crooks' motive?\n\nReuters Crooks, in a school photograph from 2020",

He plans to speak at a Bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, earlier in the day.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, US President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met at the White House on Thursday to discuss a ceasefire in the nine-month-old Gaza war. Vice President Kamala Harris will also meet with Netanyahu later in the day.\n\n\n\nThis was the first time Biden and Netanyahu met in person since Biden visited Israel shortly after the October 7 attack by Hamas. During that visit, Biden hugged Netanyahu and promised American support.\n\n\n\nThe meeting happens as American politics undergoes a change. On Sunday, Biden decided not to run for president again and endorsed Harris for the Democratic nomination in 2024.\n\n\n\n\"We've got a lot to talk about,\" Biden said when he greeted Netanyahu in the Oval Office. Netanyahu thanked Biden for his 50 years of public service and support for Israel.\n\n\n\nIn the late afternoon, Harris will meet Netanyahu at the White House. People will be watching to see how Harris, who was the first high-ranking U.S. official to call for a ceasefire, might change US policy toward Israel if she becomes president.\n\n\n\nStay with TOI for live updates:\n\n",

        "text": "Barack Obama, wife Michelle endorse Kamala Harris for US president\nFormer US President Barack Obama and wife Michelle on Friday endorsed incumbent vice president Kamala Harris for the post of US president. Barack Obama and wife Michelle have endorsed Kamala Harris in the US Presidential elections\n\n\u201cEarlier this week, Michelle and I called our friend @KamalaHarris . We told her we think she\u2019ll make a fantastic President of the United States, and that she has our full support. At this critical moment for our country, we\u2019re going to do everything we can to make sure she wins in November. We hope you\u2019ll join us,\u201d Obama posted on X.\n\n\n\nMichelle Obama, the former First Lady, said,\"I\u2019m so proud of my girl, Kamala. Barack and I are so excited to endorse her as the Democratic nominee because of her positivity, sense of humor, and ability to bring light and hope to people all across the country. We\u2019ve got your back.\"\n\n\n\nHarris, 59, has secured enough pledged delegates to clinch the Democratic presidential nomination, this days after incumbent president Joe Biden opted out of the presidential race.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt has been the greatest honour of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek re-election, I believe it is in the best interest of my party the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,\u201d Biden had said in a letter.\n\n\n\nBoth Barack and Michelle Obama had campaigned separately for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Biden in 2020, including large rallies on the closing weekends before Election Day.\n\n\n\nALSO READ: What made Joe Biden drop out of presidential race? Inside \u2018last-minute\u2019 bombshell exit\n\nBiden had taken the decision amid mounting pressure from the Democrats asking him not to run for a second term. The Democrats were alarmed by his debate performance against Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that amplified worries that the oldest US president would not be able to win the election at age 81.\n\nBiden served two terms as Obama\u2019s vice president, a selection which pulled him out of the Senate and thrust him onto the national stage.\n\nWhile Obama had earlier defended Biden\u2019s decision to seek reelection, he privately conveyed to allies that his one-time running mate\u2019s path was more challenging after the calamitous debate, the Washington Post reported.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Trump and Harris enter 99-day sprint to decide an election that has suddenly transformed\nST. CLOUD, Minn. (AP) \u2014 Barely a week ago, a sense of inevitability hung over the U.S. presidential election.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s allies gleefully predicted a landslide victory during a Republican National Convention that felt more like a coronation for a nominee who had just survived an assassination attempt and was promising to unite the country. Democrats, desperate and listless, feared the worst as a diminished President Joe Biden clung to his party\u2019s nomination.\n\nBut over the last seven days, a week unlike any other in American history, the 2024 presidential contest has been transformed. And now, just 99 days before Election Day, a fundamentally new race is taking shape featuring new candidates, a new issue focus and a new outlook for both parties.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris stepped in for Biden last Sunday and quickly smashed fundraising records, took over social media and generated levels of excitement that some Democrats said reminded them of the energy that surrounded Barack Obama\u2019s historic candidacy nearly two decades ago.\n\n\u201cThis is potentially Obama on steroids,\u201d said Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, who was among 40,000 participants on a Black Women for Harris call last week.\n\nOn the other side, Republicans are suddenly fearful and frustrated as they begin to accept the new reality that Trump\u2019s victory is no sure thing. And as their mood sours, the finger pointing has begun. Some prominent conservatives are openly second-guessing Trump\u2019s vice presidential pick, JD Vance, a little-known Ohio senator with less than two years in office and a well-documented history of provocative statements.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nJust 12 days ago, Vance earned a huge ovation as he addressed the RNC in Milwaukee, where there was a strong belief that Trump could do no wrong in the wake of his near-death experience.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re light years away from where we were in Milwaukee,\u201d said Republican National Committee member Henry Barbour, who just a week ago predicted that the GOP might win the national popular vote this fall for the first time since 2004. He\u2019s not so sure anymore.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats now have a candidate who can speak, who can attack. They have a weapon,\u201d Barbour said. \u201cThey have a path.\u201d\n\nConventional wisdom is often wrong\n\nThe incredible speed with which the election was transformed is a stark reminder that, in the Trump era, little is certain, and the conventional wisdom is often wrong. Even now, the Democrats\u2019 newfound confidence may be premature. Early public polling suggests that Harris starts in a slightly better position against Trump than Biden was just before his withdrawal from the race. But the numbers also point to a very close race in a deeply divided nation.\n\nMeanwhile, there are still more questions than answers about the 99-day sprint that lies ahead.\n\nHarris has yet to select a running mate. Trump has introduced new uncertainty about the prospect of the next debate slated for Sept. 10 and hosted by ABC, arguing that was part of a deal arranged with Biden. Third-party candidates could still take the race in unexpected directions. And more than a billion dollars in political advertising has yet to be broadcast as both parties re-think their message, their policies and their path to 270 electoral votes.\n\nBut the shift over the last week is undeniable.\n\nHarris raised a record-smashing $200 million in the seven days since taking over Biden\u2019s campaign, with two-thirds of the haul coming from first-time contributors, her campaign said on Sunday. Over the same period, more than 170,000 volunteers have signed up to help the de facto Democratic nominee with phone banking, canvassing and other get-out-the-vote efforts.\n\nDemocrats up and down the ballot have benefited from the unprecedented surge.\n\nJohn Anzalone, a former Biden pollster, described Harris\u2019 candidacy as \u201ca defibrillator\u201d for Democrats and swing voters across the nation. \u201cWe\u2019re back in the game, baby!\u201d\n\nSen. Tammy Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat, did not attend Biden\u2019s four most recent visits to her state this year. But she was at Harris\u2019 side for the vice president\u2019s opening political rally last Wednesday.\n\nSimilarly in Michigan, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who was Biden\u2019s national campaign co-chair, was unwilling to break away from her book tour to join the president in Michigan at a critical moment earlier in the month. Whitmer will co-headline an event for the Harris campaign in Pennsylvania on Monday, having already campaigned on her behalf in New Hampshire over the weekend.\n\nAnd the conversation has been profoundly altered.\n\nNo longer are Democrats consumed by questions about their nominee\u2019s age and mental acuity. Instead, they\u2019re leaning into issues that allow them to go on offense. As a woman, Harris has focused on the GOP\u2019s fight against abortion rights in a way that Biden could not. And as a former prosecutor, she has seized on Trump\u2019s criminal conviction in New York with confidence.\n\nHarris has also leaned into a more folksy and emotional criticism of Trump and Vance; she and her allies have begun to describe the Republican presidential ticket as \u201cjust plain weird.\u201d\n\nTrump has abandoned his magnanimous tone\n\nMeanwhile, a frustrated Trump has abandoned the magnanimous tone he sought to project in the days after an assassin\u2019s bullet nearly ended his life.\n\n\u201cThey all say, \u2018I think he\u2019s changed. I think he\u2019s changed since two weeks ago. Something affected him,\u2019\u201d Trump told a massive crowd Saturday night in Minnesota. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t changed. Maybe I\u2019ve gotten worse, because I get angry at the incompetence that I witness every single day.\u201d\n\nFor now, the Republican former president and his supporters have adopted a kitchen-sink strategy as they figure out which attacks are most effective against their new Democratic opponent.\n\nSome conservatives, especially in the pro-Trump MAGA wing of the party, are calling Harris a \u201cDEI candidate,\u201d referencing \u201cdiversity, equity and inclusion\u201d to suggest Democrats only embraced her as the likely nominee because of her gender and race. House leaders on Capitol Hill have discouraged such criticism, which is largely seen as racist and sexist, but the MAGA movement has not relented.\n\nIn Minnesota over the weekend, Trump and Vance described Harris as a \u201cradical left lunatic,\u201d who wants to de-fund the police, destroy the American dream, allow immigrants in the country illegally to vote and ban fracking. Harris\u2019 team pushed back against the attacks.\n\nTrump also devoted a substantial amount of his remarks to Biden, seemingly struggling to move on from the opponent he has been fixated on since losing the 2020 election.\n\nVoters who packed into the Minnesota rally were largely upbeat about Trump\u2019s chances this fall \u2014 even in their state, which Republicans have lost in every presidential election since 1976. Sensing a shift, however, some questioned whether Harris at the top of the ticket might make the race closer.\n\n\u201cThat makes me a little nervous,\u201d said Jim Caldwell, a 59-year-old truck driver who lives in a city about 40 minutes away from St. Cloud. He pointed to the historic nature of Harris\u2019 candidacy that \u201cmight bring out more people.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are going to want the first woman,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the one.\u201d\n\nJohn Jose, a 56-year-old associate pastor from St. Cloud, said he was optimistic, especially because of the upheaval on the Democratic side. He also described the last week or two as \u201cdramatic.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we need stability right now,\u201d Jose said.\n\n___\n\nAP writers Lisa Mascaro and Emily Swanson in Washington contributed to this report.",

JD Vance on Sunday spoke about his past criticisms of former President Donald Trump.\n\nWhen asked by ABC News if he and Trump have talked about his past criticism of the former president, Vance said yes, adding that Trump \"doesn't care about what I said eight years ago.\"\n\n\"I mean, look, President Trump and I have talked a lot about this,\" Vance said. \"In fact, I sometimes joke that I wish that he had the memory of Joe Biden, because he's got a memory like a steel trap, and he certainly remembers criticisms that people have made.\"\n\nRepublican vice presidential nominee Sen.

Because his agenda made people's lives better,\" Vance said.\n\n\"This whole thing is not about red team versus blue team or winning an election for its own sake. It's about getting a chance to govern so that you can bring down the cost of groceries, close that border and stop the fentanyl coming across our country for four years,\u201d Vance continued, saying he was \"wrong\" about Trump.\n\nRepublican vice presidential nominee Sen.

And that's what you do when people do a good job and you're wrong. I've talked to President Trump a lot about it, but look, he, I mean, he just, he doesn't... He doesn't care about what I said eight years ago. He cares about whether we together [and] can govern the country successful.\u201d\n\nWhen asked again if the two have talked about the subject, specifically in the last week since his comments have resurfaced, Vance admitted that they haven't spoken about it and their conversations have focused on the race ahead.\n\n-ABC News' Kelsey Walsh, Soorin Kim and Hannah Demissie",

Julia Nikhinson/AP\n\nGOP vice presidential nominee JD Vance on Sunday said his comments about \u201cchildless cat ladies\u201d were a \u201cquip\u201d and not a criticism of people without children.\n\n\u201cBut there are a whole host of people who don\u2019t have children for a whole host of reasons, and they certainly are great people who can participate fully in the life of this country, and that\u2019s not what I said,\u201d the Ohio senator told Fox News\u2019 Trey Gowdy.\n\nVance said in 2021 that the US was being run by \u201ca bunch of childless cat ladies.\u201d He said: \u201cAnd it\u2019s just a basic fact \u2014 you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez) \u2014 the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children. And how does it make any sense that we\u2019ve turned our country over to people who don\u2019t really have a direct stake in it?\u201d\n\nBut on Sunday night, Vance said, \u201cThis is not a criticism and was never criticism, Trey, of everybody without children,\u201d accusing Democrats of taking his comments \u201cout of context.\u201d\n\nWhat he was attempting to convey, Vance said, was that it\u2019s \u201cimportant for us to be pro-family as a country.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, for a whole host of reasons, it\u2019s not going to work out for some people. We should pray for those people and of course have sympathy for them. I still think that means we should be pro-family, generally speaking, as a party,\u201d he argued.",

Their hope was boosted by purported exit polls showing a healthy margin of victory for Gonz\u00e1lez. Exit polls are not allowed under Venezuelan law.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"I'm so happy,\" said Merling Fern\u00e1ndez, a 31-year-old bank employee, as a representative for the opposition campaign walked out of one voting center in a working class neighborhood of Caracas to announce results showing Gonz\u00e1lez more than doubled Maduro's vote count. Dozens standing nearby erupted in an impromptu rendition of the national anthem.\n\n\"This is the path toward a new Venezuela,\" added Fern\u00e1ndez, holding back tears. \"We are all tired of this yoke.\"\n\nMaduro supporters were not showing any signs of throwing in the towel, however.\n\n\"We can't give results, but we can show face,\" a smiling Jorge Rodriguez, campaign chief for Maduro, said at a press conference.\n\nPolls were supposed to begin closing at 6 p.m. but more than three hours after the deadline some voting centers in Caracas remained open and authorities were silent. The opposition called for the National Electoral Council to begin counting ballots.\n\n\"This is the decisive moment,\" Machado, flanked by Gonz\u00e1lez, told reporters at their campaign headquarters.\n\ntoggle caption Matias Delacroix/AP\n\nMachado was careful not to claim victory before authorities announce results but said she had already received copies of some official voting tallies and they indicated a record turnout \u2014 exactly what the opposition needed to overcome Maduro's well-greased electoral machine.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nGonz\u00e1lez was similarly enthused, congratulating Venezuelans on the \"historic\" day and urging supporters to \"celebrate in peace.\"\n\nEarlier, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris offered her support. \"The United States stands with the people of Venezuela who expressed their voice in today's historic presidential election.,\" Harris wrote on X. \"The will of the Venezuelan people must be respected.\"\n\nA few Maduro allies were also projecting confidence.\n\n\"The ballot boxes express what the streets said during these past few months of campaigning,\" Maduro's son, lawmaker Nicolas Maduro Guerra, said on X as night fell on the capital. \"Victory for the Venezuelan people.\"\n\nBut in the absence of any order to close polls, their optimism rang hollow.\n\nVoters started lining up at some voting centers across the country before dawn Sunday, sharing water, coffee and snacks for several hours.\n\nThe election will have ripple effects throughout the Americas, with government opponents and supporters alike signaling their interest in joining the exodus of 7.7 million Venezuelans who have already left their homes for opportunities abroad should Maduro win another six year term.\n\nAuthorities set Sunday's election to coincide with what would have been the 70th birthday of former President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the revered leftist firebrand who died of cancer in 2013, leaving his Bolivarian revolution in the hands of Maduro. But Maduro and his United Socialist Party of Venezuela are more unpopular than ever among many voters who blame his policies for crushing wages, spurring hunger, crippling the oil industry and separating families due to migration.\n\nMaduro, 61, is facing off against an opposition that has managed to line up behind a single candidate after years of intraparty divisions and election boycotts that torpedoed their ambitions to topple the ruling party.\n\nMachado was blocked by the Maduro-controlled supreme court from running for any office for 15 years. A former lawmaker, she swept the opposition's October primary with over 90% of the vote. After she was blocked from joining the presidential race, she chose a college professor as her substitute on the ballot, but the National Electoral Council also barred her from registering. That's when Gonz\u00e1lez, a political newcomer, was chosen.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSunday's ballot also features eight other candidates challenging Maduro, but only Gonz\u00e1lez threatens Maduro's rule.\n\nAfter voting, Maduro said he would recognize the election result and urged all other candidates to publicly declare that they would do the same.\n\n\"No one is going to create chaos in Venezuela,\" Maduro said. \"I recognize and will recognize the electoral referee, the official announcements and I will make sure they are recognized.\"\n\nVenezuela sits atop the world's largest proven oil reserves, and once boasted Latin America's most advanced economy. But it entered into a free fall after Maduro took the helm. Plummeting oil prices, widespread shortages and hyperinflation that soared past 130,000% led first to social unrest and then mass emigration.\n\nEconomic sanctions from the U.S. seeking to force Maduro from power after his 2018 reelection \u2014 which the U.S. and dozens of other countries condemned as illegitimate \u2014 only deepened the crisis.\n\nMaduro's pitch to voters this election is one of economic security, which he tried to sell with stories of entrepreneurship and references to a stable currency exchange and lower inflation rates. The International Monetary Fund forecasts the economy will grow 4% this year \u2014 one of the fastest in Latin America \u2014 after having shrunk 71% from 2012 to 2020.\n\nBut most Venezuelans have not seen any improvement in their quality of life. Many earn under $200 a month, which means families struggle to afford essential items. Some work second and third jobs. A basket of basic staples \u2014 sufficient to feed a family of four for a month \u2014 costs an estimated $385.\n\nJudith Cantilla, 52, voted to change those conditions.\n\n\"For me, change in Venezuela (is) that there are jobs, that there's security, there's medicine in the hospitals, good pay for the teachers, for the doctors,\" she said, casting her ballot in the working-class Petare neighborhood of Caracas.\n\nElsewhere, Liana Ibarra, a manicurist in greater Caracas, got in line at 3 a.m. Sunday with her water, coffee and cassava snack-laden backpack only to find at least 150 people ahead of her.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"There used to be a lot of indifference toward elections, but not anymore,\" Ibarra said.\n\nShe said that if Gonz\u00e1lez loses, she will ask her relatives living in the U.S. to sponsor her and her son's application to legally emigrate there. \"We can't take it anymore,\" she said.\n\nThe opposition has tried to seize on the huge inequalities arising from the crisis, during which Venezuelans abandoned their country's currency, the bolivar, for the U.S. dollar.\n\nGonz\u00e1lez and Machado focused much of their campaigning on Venezuela's vast hinterland, where the economic activity seen in Caracas in recent years didn't materialize. They promised a government that would create sufficient jobs to attract Venezuelans living abroad to return home and reunite with their families.\n\nAfter voting at a church-adjacent poll site in an upper-class Caracas neighborhood, Gonz\u00e1lez called on the country's armed forces to respect \"the decision of our people.\"\n\n\"What we see today are lines of joy and hope,\" Gonz\u00e1lez, 74, told reporters. \"We will change hatred for love. We will change poverty for progress. We will change corruption for honesty. We will change goodbyes for reunions.\"\n\nAn April poll by Caracas-based Delphos said about a quarter of Venezuelans were thinking about emigrating if Maduro wins Sunday. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.\n\nMost Venezuelans who migrated over the past 11 years settled in Latin America and the Caribbean. In recent years, many began setting their sights on the U.S.\n\nBoth campaigns have distinguished themselves not only for the political movements they represent but also on how they have addressed voters' hopes and fears.\n\nMaduro's campaign rallies featured lively electronic merengue dancing as well as speeches attacking his opponents. But after he caught heat from leftist allies such as Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva for a comment about a \"bloodbath\" should he lose, Maduro recoiled. His son told the Spanish newspaper El Pais that the ruling party would peacefully hand over the presidency if it loses \u2014 a rare admission of vulnerability out of step with Maduro campaign's triumphalist tone.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn contrast, the rallies of Gonz\u00e1lez and Machado prompted people to cry and chant \" Freedom! Freedom! \" as the duo passed by. People handed the devout Catholics rosaries, walked along highways and went through military checkpoints to reach their events. Others video-called their relatives who have migrated to let them catch a glimpse of the candidates.\n\n\"We do not want more Venezuelans leaving, and to those who have left I say that we will do everything possible to get them back here, and we will welcome them with open arms,\" Gonz\u00e1lez said Sunday.\n\nAssociated Press writer Fabiola S\u00e1nchez contributed to this report.\n\n",

        "text": "We're 100 days away from the U.S. presidential election. An expert predicts what will happen next\nIn the week U.S. President Joe Biden announced his departure from the upcoming U.S. election, prospective candidate and Vice-President Kamala Harris fundraised US$200 million and 170,000 volunteers signed up to help her campaign.\n\nBut what can we expect in the now 100 days leading up to Election Day?\n\nFor Democrats, even though the Democratic National Convention (DNC) is set to take place in Chicago later in August, political and social commentator Avis Jones-DeWeever says their eyes will be on what takes place Aug. 7.\n\n\"What's happening on Aug. 7 is when Vice-President Harris will become officially the candidate for the Democratic party, there's going to be a virtual meeting where the delegates can actually vote virtually prior to the convention and they need to do that in order to meet certain state deadlines to get her on the ballot in all 50 states,\" DeWeever said during an interview with CTV News Channel that aired Sunday morning.\n\nThe virtual meeting will also reveal who will join Harris as her running mate on the official Democratic ticket.\n\nOnly then will everyone turn their focus toward the DNC, DeWeever says, which will now be treated as a celebration after Harris breathed new life into the party \u2013 something predicted by recent polling, as an AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found about six in 10 Democrats believe Harris would do a good job as president.\n\nBefore Biden dropped his re-election bid, a symphony of Democrat voices called for the president to step aside following his disastrous performance during a debate with the presumptive Republican nominee, former U.S. president Donald Trump, on June 27.\n\nDeWeever called it an \"ugly moment\" for American liberals, with donors telling the president they'd close their pocket books and Hollywood's George Clooney penning a New York Times article opining Biden's inability to serve another term \u2013 but now Harris is propping the party back up.\n\n\"It is amazing to see the bounce that she has provided the Democrats in the polls \u2013 she's literally closed the gap in several key states with Donald Trump just in a week's time,\" DeWeever said.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Friday the race between Harris and Trump is \"essentially tied\" with its latest poll seeing Trump with a two per cent lead over the current vice-president, while HarrisX/Forbes polls Trump with a three per cent lead.\n\n\"What's going to be interesting to watch out for: will there be an additional bounce at the conclusion of the Democratic Convention? If so, that would be a very, very encouraging tailwind that she'll have going forward into the final months until the election.\"\n\nTrump's next steps\n\nIt's crucial for the former president to reconsider his messaging, DeWeever said. Although Trump is leading in the polls, she notes it\u2019s still within the margin of error.\n\n\"The momentum is going in the direction of the Harris campaign and so clearly their initial instincts in terms of really harkening to racism and sexism with regards to attacks on her, isn't working,\" DeWeever said.\n\nRepublican leaders warned its party members to steer clear from these types of attacks earlier this week and urged lawmakers to stick to critiques on the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s policies. The admonitions came after some members and Trump allies called Harris \u2013 a former district attorney, attorney general and senator in California \u2013 as a \"DEI\" hire (a derisive reference to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives).\n\nREAD MORE: Republican leaders urge colleagues to steer clear of racist and sexist attacks on Harris\n\nVice-presidential pick JD Vance might also be hindering Trump's reach with prospective voters, DeWeever adds, and called the Ohio senator a \"dud\" and an \"embarrassment.\"\n\n\"They're going to have to figure out how can they not only energize those people who would have voted for him anyway, because they have them, how can they reach out to independents? How can they maybe sway some key demographics? I know at one point they were going after Black men very aggressively \u2013 are they going to be able to do that now? Those are some things that they need to rethink and figure out,\" she said.\n\nThen there's the question of whether Trump will debate Harris on Sept. 10 \u2013 something the current vice-president accused him of \"backpedalling\" on. That said, Trump's camp says it will not commit to a Trump-Harris debate until the Democratic Party formally chooses a nominee, deeming it inappropriate to \"schedule things with Harris because Democrats very well could still change their minds.\"\n\nWith files from The Associated Press",

        "text": "A remarkable new dynamic has emerged in the US election: Kamala Harris can win\nThrough all the turmoil at the top of US politics, a remarkable new dynamic has emerged: Kamala Harris can win in November.\n\nThe moment after Donald Trump was left bloodied by a would-be assassin's bullet, the political reality changed dramatically.\n\nTrump seemed indestructible. He showed himself as the ultimate political animal \u2014 most people would be in shock and fear after someone had tried to kill them, but not Trump. He realised it made for a great political moment, raising his fist and shouting \"Fight, fight, fight!\"\n\nHis rival for the presidency at that time was Joe Biden, a frail man who was becoming increasingly enfeebled.\n\nLeading Democrats were in despair. They believed that short of something dramatic, Trump was heading back to the White House.\n\nLoading...\n\nThen it was the Democrats' turn for a dramatic twist. Key Democrats, including Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama, made clear that Biden was not a viable candidate.\n\nBiden was fighting against that immovable reality \u2014 date of birth. DOB won.\n\nThe Democrats were tearing themselves apart as a man for whom they had great affection and respect could not bring himself to face the toughest of realities: he was too old for the job.\n\nIn the end, key Democrats' fear of a Trump redux overpowered their affection for \"Joe\".\n\nDonald Trump's choice of running mate in JD Vance doesn't broaden his appeal. (Reuters: Tom Brenner)\n\nA new race for Trump\n\nFor those few days between the assassination attempt and the Democrats' subtle leadership coup, Donald Trump was riding high. So convinced did Trump appear to be of the inevitability of a victory that he discarded conventional political wisdom and chose a running mate who in no way broadened his appeal \u2014 JD Vance.\n\nForced from the campaign, Biden quickly pivoted to endorsing his loyal deputy, Vice-President Harris.\n\nSuddenly, the race was not between two old men but between one old man \u2014 a convicted felon who almost had to be blasted from office in his previous presidential term \u2014 and a relatively young, smart professional woman at the height of her game.\n\nOvernight, Harris appealed to the Democrats' base, which re-united. Women \u2014 young women in particular \u2014 now can contemplate the possibility that they will see the first female president in US history.\n\nI went to Washington to tap into US politics, but got much more than I bargained for Photo shows Man in grey-blue suit, without tie stands in front of a camera reporting. He is outside the White House in Washington DC. An election campaign that was mostly static before the presidential debate has transformed into one of the most volatile and consequential in more than 50 years.\n\nLikewise, people from diverse backgrounds can, once again, contemplate the sentiments they had when they propelled Barack Obama into the White House, despite decades of predictions that the US would never elect a black president.\n\nEarly indications are that Harris has the ability to galvanise several key constituencies \u2014 women, young people, African Americans, minority groups and of course traditional Democrats. Certainly, serious money is now flowing into the Democrats' campaign.\n\nNone of this is to say that Harris is any certainty. Harris has not yet felt the relentless brutality of the US media as it will attempt to interview anyone the vice-president has ever lived next to, worked with or offended.\n\nLoading...\n\nHarris changes Gaza stance\n\nHarris has wasted no time differentiating herself from Biden. Within days, she has taken a much tougher position on Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nWhile insisting she supports the US's \"unshakeable\" alliance with Israel, in her recent meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington she did not hold back in her criticism of Israel's conduct of the war.\n\nDeclaring later that \"I will not be silent\" about the suffering of Palestinians, Harris said:\n\n\"What has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating. The images of dead children and desperate hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time \u2014 we cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering and I will not be silent.\"\n\nHarris's harder line comes as further evidence emerges of the catastrophic conditions in Gaza. The Guardian revealed that dozens of US doctors and nurses who have worked in Gaza have written to Biden and Harris to call for the US to withdraw diplomatic and military support for Israel until there is a ceasefire.\n\nWriting that in their view the death toll is already greater than 92,000, they say they cannot forget \"the scenes of unbearable cruelty directed at women and children that we witnessed ourselves\".\n\nThey write: \"Every single signatory to this letter treated children in Gaza who suffered violence that must have been deliberately directed at them. Specifically, every one of us on a daily basis treated pre-teen children who were shot in the head.\"\n\nSeveral of the signatories previously told The Guardian they believed Israeli snipers were targeting children and reported the devastating impact on civilians of weapons designed to spray high levels of shrapnel.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe Israeli army has repeatedly denied human rights abuses, saying that because Hamas embeds itself among civilians and uses them as \"human shields\" it is inevitable that some civilians will be killed.\n\nPolitically, a harder line may not be a bad thing for the Harris campaign. Much of the Jewish American vote in the US is concentrated in what are not swing states, such as Florida and New York, while Arab American voters are in several swing states, such as Michigan.\n\nUnder Biden's candidacy, many Arab American voters suggested they were not going to vote in November in protest against Biden's support for Israel in its ongoing war.\n\nA different approach by Harris may help the Democrats to hold a state such as Michigan, which has high value under the US's electoral college system.\n\nThe reality of a tough campaign\n\nWhile the result of the election is completely unpredictable, we now have a real contest.\n\n\"Kamala Harris can win, but it will be uphill,\" says Bruce Wolpe, a non-resident senior fellow at the United States Studies Centre in Sydney and author of Trump's Australia. Wolpe is also a former Democratic staffer in Washington.\n\n\"If the election were held today, Trump would win. Trump is riding high, especially since the shooting, with his supporters as enthusiastic and welded-on as ever. Trump's base is as strong as ever \u2014 especially since the assassination attempt.\n\n\"Harris has strong prospects for bringing back young voters who deserted President Biden, gaining stronger support from black voters and Latinos and winning support from women \u2014 similar to the teal voters in Australia.\n\nAs Biden pledges to 'pass the torch', his VP is sharpening her attacks on Trump Photo shows US Senator Kamala Harris smiles widely as she walks ahead of three other people. As Joe Biden starts his long goodbye with a televised address from the Oval Office, Donald Trump and his likely rival in November's presidential election, Kamala Harris, have been trading blows as a recast race for the White House begins.\n\n\"There are two core tasks for Harris. The first is taking Trump down by prosecuting and winning with independent voters the case that Trump is unfit for office and too extreme. And secondly, building up Democratic voters' enthusiasm so that Harris can come close to reprising [the victory] Biden and Harris secured in 2020. If she executes on those fronts, yes, she can win.\"\n\nWhen the euphoria among Democrats recedes, the reality of a campaign will put the blowtorch on both Harris and Trump.\n\nDemocracy is the ultimate free market. Voters are asked to buy a particular product. While Joe Biden was the candidate, Americans were being asked to buy a product that looked and behaved as faulty. The product was a year or two past its use-by date.\n\nDemocratic strategists, and much of the supportive media, were trying to argue that while the product may have been beyond its use-by date, it was still in excellent condition.\n\nThis does not mean, of course, that the majority of these groups will vote for Harris.\n\nAmerica is a very divided country, and no constituency can be taken for granted.\n\nLoading...\n\nBorder a weakness for Harris\n\nDemocrats have gone from trying to convince each other that they could support a man physically and mentally deteriorating to being asked to support an energetic, feisty woman who for four years has been sitting at the top table.\n\nThis could, of course, have its own liability. More than almost anyone she must have realised that Biden was not capable of running, let alone governing for another four years. And yet she was a cheerleader in the movement that tried to convince the public that Biden was on top of the toughest job in the world.\n\nNikki Haley provided an interesting insight in January, referring to the fact that both the major parties had elderly men as candidates. \"The first party to retire its 80-year-old candidate is going to win.\"\n\nOn Haley's logic, the Democrats are going to win.\n\nOne of Harris's possible strengths \u2014 similar to that of the new prime minister of the UK, Keir Starmer \u2014 is a background as a prosecutor. People often like the narrative of someone who \"put bad guys away\".\n\nDriving the dangerous road to Trump's border wall Photo shows Photo taken from the back seat of a car, showing a man in a cowboy hat driving a dirt road along the border wall. Where Trump's unfinished wall ends on Jim's ranch you can simply walk across the border into Mexico. It's the centre of a political battle that will shape the US presidential election.\n\nAnalyst Bruce Wolpe says Harris had \"a very rocky start\" as vice-president. \"Things [for her] were very uneven in the media, staff churn in her office, she was given the immigration portfolio and her work was seen as ineffective in asserting control over the southern border.\"\n\nIndeed, the chaotic state of the border with Mexico will probably be Harris's biggest political liability. Whether in the US or Australia, there are few more emotional issues than border security.\n\nIn Australia, John Howard tapped into this sentiment \u2014 successfully \u2014 during the 2001 election campaign with his famous declaration: \"We will decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come.\"\n\nThe porousness of the border with Mexico is a major issue for Americans. Harris was designated by President Biden to fix the border and has clearly failed. Many illegal migrants continue to enter the US.\n\nAccording to a report on May 22, 2024, by the US House Committee on Homeland Security, more than 9 million illegal immigrants have entered the US since Biden became president.\n\nThe report said there had been 7.8 million \"encounters\" \u2014 the term used for illegal entries \u2014 at the south-west border with Mexico. It's important to note that the committee is controlled by Republicans, so Democrats challenge the reliability of the report.\n\nNonetheless, what is not deniable is that the US has a major problem with its southern border \u2014 which is why Trump's frequent promise to complete \"the wall\" that he began building during his first term has a resonance with many Americans.\n\nSays Bruce Wolpe: \"Immigration is Trump's number one issue and he will pummel her over it.\" However, he adds that over the past two years, Harris has had enormous recognition for her campaign for abortion rights, and is connecting with women across the US.\n\n\"She has also been outspoken on gun control,\" says Wolpe. \"Most Americans want to see progress on those two issues [women's rights and gun control]. Harris has taken to the world stage, representing the president. Harris is now performing strongly \u2014 and at the same time, she is underestimated. That is not a bad place to be politically.\"\n\nHarris's background as a prosecutor in California could be both a political positive and negative. There will be those who like a hard-nosed prosecutor, but there's another reality: many of those Harris imprisoned were African American men, and there is likely to be no shortage of men who will be keen to convince the media that Harris wrongly sent them to jail.\n\nLoading\n\nVP choice matters\n\nIn terms of Trump's vulnerabilities, one of those may be the abortion issue, or as Harris calls it, \"reproductive rights\".\n\nWhile Trump has not been as hardline as many Republicans against abortion, the man he has chosen as his running mate, JD Vance, is without question a hard-liner on the issue.\n\nTrump chose Vance when Biden was still his rival and Trump was at the height of his popularity. He'd survived an assassination attempt, had an enfeebled opponent and all the polls indicated he would win.\n\nSuddenly, that seemingly guaranteed path back to the Oval Office is in danger.\n\nTrump appeared to feel politically invincible. He therefore did not see the need to broaden his appeal and choose a running mate who would widen his net of potential supporters.\n\nHarris's choice of a running mate will be equally crucial.\n\nBut all those around Trump who urged him not to go with someone as hardline as JD Vance may prove vindicated now that the entire contest is in flux.",

The crowd cheered loudly and started to chant \u201cTrump\u201d at this declaration.\n\nMr Gensler led a crackdown on the crypto industry, and has previously said the sector is rife with \u201chucksters\u201d.\n\nThe SEC brought charges against the \"King of Crypto\" Sam Bankman-Fried, who was sentenced to 25 years for stealing billions of dollars from customers of his FTX cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nSpeaking for about 45 minutes, Trump outlined some of his ideas for the sector if he were to win November's election. He said he would make the US the cryptocurrency capital of the world. His support for the industry is a 180 turn from his comments in 2021, when he told Fox Business he saw Bitcoin as a \u201cscam\u201d affecting the value of the US dollar.\n\nTrump told the crowd at the event he would keep 100% of Bitcoin that the US government currently holds or acquires, adding that it would be a \u201cnational Bitcoin stockpile\u201d.\n\nThe former president also said he would \u201cimmediately appoint a Bitcoin and crypto presidential advisory council\u201d.",

        "text": "Trump tells Christian voters they \"won't have to vote anymore\" if he is elected in November\nHarris ramps up campaign as Trump remarks to Christian voters generate controversy\n\nFormer President Donald Trump told attendees at a conservative Christian event on Friday night that they \"won't have to vote anymore\" if he is elected into office in November. He implored Christians to save America by voting \"just this time,\" so that he can win the presidential election in a landslide \"that's too big to rig.\"\n\nTrump, who is the Republican Party's candidate for president, made his remarks at the end of a speech at The Believers' Summit, an event hosted by the conservative advocacy group Turning Point Action, in West Palm Beach, Florida.\n\n\"Christians get out and vote. Just this time,\" he urged. \"You won't have to do it anymore. Four more years. You know what? It'll be fixed. It'll be fine. You won't have to vote anymore my beautiful Christians.\"\n\nFormer U.S. President and 2024 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump onstage after speaking at Turning Point Action's \"The Believers Summit\" in West Palm Beach, Florida, on July 26, 2024. CHANDAN KHANNA/AFP via Getty Images\n\nTrump continued: \"I love you Christians and I'm a Christian. I love you, you got to get out and vote. In four years, you don't have to vote again. We'll have it fixed so good, you're not going to have to vote.\"\n\nOn social media, there were some calls of alarm in response to Trump's comments, expressing concern that they alluded to authoritarianism and could be interpreted as an indication that he would not leave office if he wins the election.\n\n\"Democracy is in danger. This is not a drill,\" posted Allison Gill, who co-hosts the podcast \"Jack,\" along with an image displaying Trump's message to Christians.\n\nToward the end of his hour-long speech, Trump said that the Democrats rigged the 2020 presidential election, which Trump falsely maintained that he won over President Biden.\n\nThe audience gave him a standing ovation, chanting: \"Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight\" and fist-pumping the way Trump did after a bullet grazed his ear during an attempted assassination at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania two weeks ago.\n\nTrump shared that he had removed the last bandage from his ear just before speaking at the event.\n\n\"I just took it off. I took it off for this group. I don't know why I did that for this group, but that's it,\" he said.\n\nBefore Friday night's event, Trump had first been wearing a large white bandage over his ear. By the time of his rally in Charlotte, North Carolina on Wednesday, he was wearing a more discreet flesh-colored one.\n\nCBS News reached out to the Trump campaign for comment on his remarks.\n\nTrump spoke to a packed audience at the summit just hours after meeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at Mar-a-Lago. Netanyahu met with Mr. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris separately a day earlier at the White House. Event organizers said about 3,500 people attended the former president's speech.\n\nHe spent much of his speech criticizing Harris, who is the presumptive Democratic nominee for president after President Biden decided to drop his reelection bid.\n\nOther speakers at the two-day event, which focused on \"unity and biblical truth,\" included former Trump adviser Peter Navarro, Dr. Ben Carson, Housing and Urban Development Secretary during the Trump administration and conservative political activist Charlie Kirk.\n\nNavarro, who was recently released from prison, spoke shortly before Trump and led the audience in a chant of: \"If we don't control our government, their government will control us.\"\n\nHe told the audience that the justice system had unfairly gone after him, using rhetoric similar to that often used by Trump.\n\n\"What happened to me, can happen to you,\" said Navarro. \"If they can come for Donald Trump, they can come for you.\"\n\nNavarro served a four-month sentence for defying a congressional subpoena. He was released earlier this month.\n\nThe former president has previously sought to appeal to evangelical Christians.\n\nIn June, he told a group of politically influential evangelical Christians in Washington that they \"cannot afford to sit on the sidelines\" of the 2024 election, imploring them at one point to \"go and vote, Christians, please!\"",

        "text": "Joe Biden 2024 presidential campaign\nAmerican political campaign\n\nJoe Biden, the 46th and incumbent president of the United States, announced his candidacy for re-election for a second presidential term on April 25, 2023, with Vice President Kamala Harris as his running mate. He suspended the campaign on July 21, 2024.\n\nBiden made protecting American democracy a central focus of his campaign,[7][8] along with restoring the federal right to abortion following the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade.[9] He also intended to increase funding for border patrol and security,[9][10] and increase funding for law enforcement coupled with police reform.[11] Biden promised to support, protect and expand LGBT rights[9] and frequently touted his previous passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Chips and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act's landmark[12][13] investment to combat climate change.[14]\n\nBiden made strengthening U.S. alliances a key goal of his foreign policy[15] and promised to continue supporting Ukraine following the Russian invasion of the country and Israel following their war with Hamas, describing them as \"vital\" to U.S. national security interests. Biden promised to continue efforts to tackle gun violence and defend the Affordable Care Act following comments from Donald Trump suggesting he would repeal the law.[16][9] He proposed increasing taxes on the wealthy through a \"billionaire minimum income tax\" to reduce the deficit and fund social services for the poor.[17][9] Biden's trade policy was described as rejecting traditional neoliberal economic policy and the Washington Consensus that resulted in the offshoring of manufacturing and populist backlash. It included targeted tariffs against strategic Chinese industries to protect manufacturing jobs and counter China's technological and military ambitions.[18][19]\n\nOn March 12, 2024, Biden became the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party after clinching enough delegates in Georgia, and did not face any significant primary challengers.[20] The first presidential debate was held on June 27, 2024, between Biden and Trump. Biden's performance was widely criticized, with commentators saying that he frequently lost his train of thought and gave meandering answers.[21][22][23] Several newspaper columnists declared Trump winner of the debate,[24][25][26][27] which was supported by polling results.[28] After the debate, concerns about his health intensified, and Biden faced many calls to withdraw from the race, including from fellow Democrats[29] and the editorial boards of several major news outlets.[30][31]\n\nBiden initially insisted that he would remain a candidate amid the calls to drop out.[32] However, on July 21, 2024, Biden ended his re-election campaign and endorsed vice president Kamala Harris as his successor.[33] Harris launched her own campaign later that day.[34] By July 22, 2024, Harris had secured enough delegates to become the presumptive Democratic nominee.[35]\n\nBackground\n\nThis was Biden's fourth presidential campaign, and was his first as the incumbent.[36] His first campaign was in the 1988 Democratic Party presidential primaries. While he was initially considered one of the strongest candidates in that race, a scandal broke soon thereafter when news reports uncovered plagiarism by Biden in law school records and in speeches. This revelation led to his withdrawal from the race in September 1987.[37]\n\nHe made a second attempt during the 2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries. Like his first presidential bid, Biden failed to garner a sufficient level of endorsements and support. He withdrew from the race after his poor performance in the Iowa caucus on January 3, 2008. He was eventually chosen to be the running mate of the party's nominee Barack Obama. Following the Obama/Biden ticket's victory in the general election, Biden was sworn in as vice president of the United States on January 20, 2009. He ran again as Obama's running mate in 2012 and was re-elected vice president, being sworn in for second term on January 20, 2013, and serving until January 20, 2017.\n\nBiden's third presidential bid came during the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries where he focused his plans as the candidate with the best chance of defeating then-president Donald Trump in the general election. Politico reported in 2018 that Biden had rejected a proposition to commit to serving only one term as president.[38]\n\nIn May 2021, Biden's chief of staff Ron Klain indicated the Biden administration was \"anticipating a bruising general election matchup\" against Donald Trump, who had served as the 45th president of the United States and had been defeated by Biden in the 2020 presidential election, if the latter followed through on a bid to return to the presidency.[39] In November 2021, against a backdrop of declining approval ratings, the Biden White House reiterated Biden's intent to run for reelection.[40] In a March 2022 press conference, when asked about the possibility that Trump could be his opponent in 2024, Biden replied, \"I'd be very fortunate if I had that same man running against me\".[41]\n\nIn a PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll released on April 25, 2023 \u2013 the day Biden announced his reelection campaign \u2013 his approval rating was just 41%, with a disapproval rating of 50%.[42] Several polls both before and after Biden's campaign announcement have shown that most Democrats want the party to nominate someone other than Biden for president in the 2024 election.[43][44][45][needs update]\n\nCampaign\n\nBiden and Harris, May 2023\n\nAnnouncement\n\nOn April 25, 2023, Biden announced he was running for re-election. It was also announced that Julie Ch\u00e1vez Rodriguez would serve as campaign manager and Quentin Fulks would be principal deputy campaign manager. Lisa Blunt Rochester, Jim Clyburn, Chris Coons, Tammy Duckworth, Jeffrey Katzenberg, and Gretchen Whitmer were named national campaign co-chairs. Biden's campaign was launched four years to the day after the start of his 2020 presidential campaign.[46] Politico reported that: \"Biden is considering Michael Tyler (the longtime Democratic operative) for the role of communications director in his 2024 campaign\".[47]\n\nBiden formally kicked off his reelection campaign on June 17, 2023, at a union rally in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.[48]\n\nSocial media activity\n\nThe Biden campaign created an account on Truth Social in October 2023.[49] They announced on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that they had created the account on Truth Social because they found the idea \"very funny\".[50] Numerous observers characterised this as an exercise by the Biden campaign in trolling Donald Trump.[51][52]\n\nIn May 2024, the Biden campaign posted a listing for a full-time Content and Meme Pages Partner Manager. The job description stated, \"In this role, you will initiate and manage day-to-day operations in engaging the internet's top content and meme pages\". The Meme Manager will be a first for a presidential campaign.[53]\n\nNational advisory board\n\nThe Biden-Harris 2024 national advisory board consisted of:[54][55]\n\nPlatform\n\nBiden frequently stated his intention to \"finish the job\" as a campaign theme and political rallying cry.[56][57] Biden was described as a political moderate and centrist,[58] and during the campaign was seeking to attract moderate Republicans and independents for his 2024 reelection bid.[59]\n\nAbortion access\n\nBiden was described as running on one of the most overtly abortion rights platform of any general election candidate in political history.[60] Biden promised to restore Roe v. Wade if reelected, and criticized court rulings limiting abortion access or restricting the availability of abortion pills.[9][61]\n\nDemocracy\n\nBiden made defending American democracy the cornerstone of his presidential campaign, stating during a speech on January 5, 2024, \"the defense, protection and preservation of American democracy will remain, as it has been, the central cause of my presidency.\"[8] Biden frequently called attention to Trump's former attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election[62][63] and its culmination in the January 6 United States Capitol attack,[64][65] widely described as an attempted coup d'\u00e9tat[66][67][68] or self-coup.[69][70] Trump has claimed that Joe Biden is the \"destroyer\"[71] and real threat to democracy,[72] and has repeated false claims that the 2020 election was rigged and stolen from him, of which there has been no evidence.[71]\n\nJoe Biden framed the 2024 election as a battle for democracy and defending the \"soul of America,\"[7] which echoes Biden's framing of current geopolitics as \"the battle between democracy and autocracy.\"[73] Joe Biden previously cited democracy and \"a battle for the soul of our nation\" as a key message of his successful 2020 run, and repeatedly touched on the issue of democracy since announcing his candidacy for the 2020 presidential election.[74]\n\nEconomy and trade\n\nBiden dubbed his economic policy \"Bidenomics\" and promised to create middle-class jobs and reject trickle-down economics. For his 2024 reelection campaign, Biden pointed to his previous passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Chips and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act; all of which are expected to invest $1 to $2 trillion in industrial policy over 10 years.[14] Biden previously passed the American Rescue Plan Act to speed up the economic recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent recession.[75][76]\n\nBiden's trade agenda was described as rejecting traditional neoliberal economic policies and the Washington Consensus in favor of de-risking supply chains from China and economic investment in target nations to address pandemic resilience, climate change, U.N. Sustainable Development Goals and the rejection of Chinese-style autocracy. Biden's policies are expected to increase public-private partnerships through the World Bank and IMF to compete with China's Belt and Road Initiative. Biden stated his intention to reverse neoliberal policies that resulted in the offshoring of manufacturing and thus resulted in increased populist backlash.[18] Biden enacted several targeted tariffs against China in strategic sectors such as EVs, solar cells, steel, and aluminum to protect American manufacturing and blunt China's technological and military ambitions.[19]\n\nEducation\n\nBiden previously supported two-years of free community college during his 2020 campaign, and has continued to propose it in yearly budget requests despite failing to have it pass during negotiations with Republicans as part of his Build Back Better Plan in 2021. Biden promised to triple Title I funding, and as of the end of 2023, managed an 11% increase totaling $2 billion for Title I along with increased funding for Pell Grants and $7.3 billion in investments for HBCU's.[77]\n\nBiden has stated he opposes book bans and has promised to appoint an anti-book ban coordinator to address the issue.[78] Biden has stated that attacks on teachers for talking about race and racism is wrong, and has opposed Florida's Parental Rights in Education Act. Biden supports protections for transgender students while also allowing school districts to restrict transgender women in competitive women's sports through updating Title IX protections.[79]\n\nBiden continues to support student loan relief and had made it a promise of his initial 2020 campaign,[80] and previously attempted a $400 billion student debt relief plan that was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. Biden has since implemented a more modest income-driven $39 billion debt relief plan impacting 800,000 borrowers who had paid their loans over 20 years,[81] and waived some rules regarding the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program that resulted in an additional 662,000 people having some debt canceled. On January 12, 2024, Biden announced debt relief under the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) repayment plan to wipe loans up to $12,000 that have been in repayment for 10 years or more, along with additional measures to take effect in July to limit payments to 5% of discretionary income from the previous 10%.[82] As of the end of 2023, Biden has canceled $132 billion worth of student loans affecting 3.6 million borrowers despite the Supreme Court's prior ruling.[83][79] On January 19, 2024, Biden canceled another $4.9 billion in student loan debt for 73,600 borrowers.[84] On March 21, 2024, Biden announced an additional $5.8 billion in loan relief for 77,700 borrowers through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.[85] On April 12, 2024, Biden announced another $7.4 billion in student loan relief affecting roughly 277,000 borrowers.[86]\n\nEnergy, environment, and climate change\n\nBiden stated he believes in human-caused climate change. Biden previously strengthened environmental protections that had been weakened during the Trump administration. Biden passed the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest investment in addressing climate change and clean energy in US history[88] with over $375 billion in funding and putting the US on track to meet emissions reduction targets by 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030, and has created 170,600 new clean energy jobs with over $278 billion in new investments in 44 states.[89] Biden has stated his intention to use both regulation and market forces to address climate change, and has established clean energy tax credits and subsidies for electric cars, heat-pumps, and climate friendly technology.[9]\n\nIn addition to record funding for clean energy, Biden has overseen a record in US crude oil production with over 13.2 million barrels of crude per day, beating Saudi Arabia and Russia by millions of barrels and the 13 million barrels per day produced at the peak of Trump's presidency. Biden has previously stated his intention to lower prices at the gas pump, which experts believe is key to his 2024 reelection campaign.[90] Biden's first term dealt with supply shocks caused by the 2021-2024 global energy crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic and Russian invasion of Ukraine.[91]\n\nForeign policy\n\nBiden has been described as presiding over \"the most transformative phase in U.S. foreign policy in decades,\"[92] and has made strengthening American alliances to ensure a \"position of trusted leadership\" among allies to counter Russia and China,[15] and ensuring that no other world power should surpass the United States in the military and economic spheres a focus of his presidency.[93] Biden noticeably sought to reduce U.S. military presence in the Greater Middle East, and withdrew troops from Afghanistan after which the Taliban seized control.[94] Biden has made strengthening the NATO alliance and preparing for great power competition a cornerstone of his first term in office,[95] and has promised to defend the NATO alliance during his second term following reported comments that Trump told European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen that America would \"never come to help you and to support you\" if Europe was attacked.[96] Biden has described modern geopolitics as \"the battle between democracy and autocracy.\"[73] Biden has promised to continue supporting Ukraine following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Israel following the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel, describing them as \"vital\" to U.S. national security interests.[9] By March 2024, Biden has become increasingly critical of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and has authorized air drops of aid and announced the construction of a military port to facilitate the delivery of aid to the enclave.[97][98]\n\nGun violence\n\nBiden promised to tackle gun violence through enacting universal background checks and increasing scrutiny of sales in gun shows and other unlicensed venues. Biden has also proposed implementing a ban on assault weapons. Biden was previously instrumental in passing the 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban that expired in 2004, and has spoken of its impacts on the campaign trail.[9][99]\n\nBiden stated his support of the First Step Act, red flag laws, increased background checks, the ability to bar people from carrying guns in schools and allowing gun manufacturers to be sued in court.\n\nBiden previously announced the formation of the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, signed the first major gun control legislation in 30 years through the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act,[100] and issued Executive Order 14092 to stiffen background checks, ensure safer firearms storage and provide additional direction for law enforcement agencies.[9][101]\n\nImmigration\n\nBiden stated his intention to increase funding and resources for border patrol and enforcement, provide a path for people in the United States to apply for legal status and eventually citizenship, and create a smoother and expanded visa process for foreign graduates of American universities. Biden previously introduced the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021 on his first day of office that stalled due to Republican opposition.[9] Biden also issued a memorandum to reinstate the DACA program,[102] overturned Trump's travel ban in Executive Order 13780,[103] and reversed Trump's Executive Order 13768 that targeted sanctuary cities in the United States.[104] The Biden administration has undertaken a policy of punishing migrants who enter the country illegally and providing temporary protections to migrants from certain countries such as Venezuela, Ukraine, Nicaragua, Cuba and Haiti. This has resulted in a total increase in migrants legally arriving at points of entry, and a decrease in migrants attempting to illegally cross the border.[105]\n\nIn February 2024, Biden supported a bipartisan immigration bill to address the Mexico-United States border crisis that included many conservative demands and also unlocked aid to Ukraine and Israel. Trump successfully called on House and Senate Republicans to kill the bill arguing that it would hurt his and Republican's reelection campaigns and deny them the ability to run on immigration as an issue.[106][107][108][109][110] Biden has since promised to campaign \"every day\" on Republican's refusal to pass the bill, stating that Donald Trump is the \"only reason the border is not secure.\"[10] On June 4, 2024, Biden passed an executive order to shut down the border if illegal crossings reached an average of 2,500 migrants a day in a given week.[111]\n\nLaw enforcement\n\nBiden ran on a pro-police message and has explicitly stated his opposition to the \"defund the police\" movement and Republican calls to \"defund the FBI.\"[112][58] Biden previously celebrated billions in funds for police departments in his 2022 State of the Union Address,[11] and has provided hundreds of millions since then towards the hiring of additional police officers, school safety efforts, and community policing efforts.[113] Biden has also called on police reform, stating in February 2023, \"when police officers or police departments violate the public trust, they must be held accountable.\" During his first term, Biden restricted the transfer of military equipment to police, directed federal law enforcement to restrict chokeholds and no-knock warrants, ordered new use-of-force standards within the Justice Department and signed an executive order to create a national database of fired police officers.[11] Biden has repeatedly pushed for community policing and violence intervention efforts and more mental and social services funding.[114]\n\nLGBT, civil, and voting rights\n\nBiden stated he supports protecting the LGBT community and supports access to gender-affirming care.[9] Biden previously passed the Respect for Marriage Act which protected same-sex and interracial marriage in the United States after a concurring opinion from Justice Clarence Thomas in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization that suggested the court should revisit Obergefell v. Hodges.[115][116]\n\nBiden previously attempted to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act in response to the George Floyd protests that ultimately failed after talks with Republican Senators broke down, resulting in Biden's passage of Executive Order 14074.[117] Biden also passed the Emmett Till Antilynching Act to officially make lynching a federal hate crime.[118]\n\nBiden passed Executive Order 14019 to protect voting rights following Republican efforts to restrict voting following the 2020 presidential election,[119] and attempted to pass the For the People Act to reduce the influence of money in politics, ban partisan gerrymandering, and create new federal ethics rules for officeholders that ultimately failed over opposition from Republican Senators.[120]\n\nSocial services and healthcare\n\nBiden promised to include the remaining pledges left out of his initial Build Back Better Act owing to resistance from Senators that ultimately resulted in the compromise Inflation Reduction Act. These include offering two years of free community college tuition, offering universal preschool and limiting the cost of childcare to 7% of income for most families. Biden has also signaled his intention to resuscitate the expanded child tax credit initially passed in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 to $3,000 for children over six and $3,600 to children under 6,[9] which previously resulted in a roughly 30% reduction in child poverty.[121]\n\nBiden has promised to protect and defend the Affordable Care Act after Trump commented he would seek to replace the law if he wins a second term,[16] [122] and Republican senators expressed openness to repealing certain sections of the law.[123][124] Biden has promised to defend Social Security and Medicare following comments made by Trump during a March 11, 2024, interview that suggested he was open to cutting the entitlement programs, which the Trump campaign later said was merely referring to \"cutting waste.\"[125][126] Biden has also signaled his intention to expand the price cap on the cost of insulin at $35 for Medicare recipients enacted as part of the Inflation Reduction Act to private insurance.[9] Biden previously signed one of the largest expansions in veterans benefits in American history through the Honoring our PACT Act of 2022 that provided medical care for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits.[127]\n\nTaxes and deficit reduction\n\nBiden shared plans to increase taxes on the wealthiest Americans to fund social services and reduce the deficit. Biden has proposed raising the top tax rate to 39.6%, the corporate tax rate to 28% and the stock buyback tax to 4%. Biden proposed a \"Billionaire Minimum Income Tax\" that would target one-hundredth of 1% of Americans (roughly 700 billionaires) that would raise over $361 billion over 10 years by ensuring the wealthy pay a minimum tax rate of 20%.[9][17]\n\nBiden previously implemented a 15% minimum tax on companies with annual income exceeding $1 billion.[9] As part of the Inflation Reduction Act, Biden provided a one-time funding boost of $80 billion to the Internal Revenue Service to modernize its systems and hire additional staff to reduce an estimated $688 billion tax gap in uncollected payments by increasing audit rates of the wealthy and tax evaders.[128] On January 12, 2024, the IRS announced it had collected more than $520 million in back taxes from delinquent high-income individuals, complex partnerships and large corporations due to increased funding from the Inflation Reduction Act.[129]\n\nCampaign finances\n\nOverall strategy\n\nThe Biden campaign was reported to plan to raise and spend $2 billion. To get around the $6,600 per donor, per year limitation to Biden's reelection campaign, the Biden campaign's financial strategy has involved closely working with the Democratic National Committee and establishing joint fundraising committees (JFC) with local state parties in all 50 states. As a result, individual donors can donate almost $1 million per year to be distributed to the DNC, local state parties, and the affiliated Biden Victory Fund. Biden's campaign previously gave the DNC its supporter and fundraising data after Inauguration Day in 2021. This approach has been noted to be different to former President Obama's use his own outside organization, Organizing for America, that ultimately competed for donors and left the DNC in debt.[130] Biden was able to raise more cash than Trump early on due to establishing JFC's before Trump was able to due to having primary opponents until March.[131]\n\nFinances throughout the 2024 campaign\n\nIn summer and fall 2023, The Associated Press reported that Democrats were nervous about Biden's lack of fundraising and campaign activity. Of note were the 2023 Writers Guild and SAG-AFTRA strikes in California that prevented Biden from raising money from Hollywood figures owing to his pro-union stance.[132] On January 15, 2024, Biden and the DNC reported taking in $97 million in the final three months of the year and after a December fundraising blitz, and announced that it took in $235 million from its launch in April 2023 and ended the year with $117 million cash on hand.[133]\n\nIn early 2024, Biden's presidential campaign was noted to have a considerable fundraising and cash advantage over Trump in part due to his opponents contributions being diverted to cover his many legal fees.[133] The Biden campaign reported raising $42 million in January with $130 million cash on hand,[134] and raising $53 million in February ending the month with $155 million cash on hand.[135] According to February FEC filings, Biden-aligned super PACs had $64 million cash on hand and $900 million has been pledged by Democratic groups and major unions.[136] According to a March 28 Reuters article, large contributions made up 55% of Biden's support, compared to 65% of Trump's support.[137]\n\nOn April 6, 2024, Biden lagged Trump in total fundraising for the first time, reporting a total April fundraising haul of $51 million compared to Trump's $76.2 million,[131] much of which was raised at Trump's self-reported $50.5 million fundraiser at the house of billionaire John Paulson.[138] The New York Times reported that Trump was widely expected to catch up in total fundraising once he secured the Republican nomination and signed a joint fundraising agreement with the RNC. Biden noticeably beat Trump in total cash on hand, having $84.5 million compared to Trump's $48 million, both figures not including PAC money.[131] Biden's aides noted a lack of big fundraising events and the \"grassroots fundraising machine\" not yet starting were partly to blame for the lower April totals.[139] In June, the Trump campaign reported a $141 million fundraising haul for May, beating Biden's $85 million haul. Trump and the RNC entered June with $235 million on hand compared to Biden's $212 million. The Trump campaign accredited the haul with the aftermath of his 34 felony convictions in May that raised $70 million in the 48 hours after the verdict and briefly crashed WinRed. Trump also received a $50 million donation from billionaire Timothy Mellon. Biden increased fundraising events in June, including a $30 million event in Los Angeles with Barack Obama and Hollywood celebrities, along with a $8 million backyard fundraiser at the home of Terry McAuliffe. The combination of Trump's improved fundraising and Biden's increased spending on television ads were noted to give Trump a cash advantage by summer 2024.[140]\n\nIn the weeks following his widely considered poor debate performance on June 27, The New York Times reported that numerous large donors had \"slammed their wallets closed\" setting the campaign on track to raise half of what it had hoped for.[141] Major Democratic donors to the pro-Biden Super PAC Future Forward were reported to be privately withholding $90 million in pledges unless Biden stepped down from the Democratic ticket.[142] Following his withdrawal from the race, the Biden campaign's finances were transferred to the Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign.[143]\n\nCampaign events\n\nOn January 5, 2024, Biden held his first campaign rally for the year. Described as an unofficial campaign kickoff near Valley Forge, Pennsylvania,[144] the event previewed Biden's campaign theme of defending democracy and labeling Trump as a danger to democracy.[7]\n\nOn January 8, 2024, Biden held his second campaign speech of the year at Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, location of the 2015 Charleston church shooting, to speak against white supremacism and compared Donald Trump and his supporters to defeated Confederates after the Civil War supporting a \"second lost cause\" around denying the results of the 2020 election.[145]\n\nOn March 28, 2024, Biden held a large campaign event with former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton at Radio City Music Hall in New York City and announced raising over $26 million,[146] a record for a single political event.[147]\n\nOn June 27, 2024, Biden debated Trump in the Joe Biden\u2013Donald Trump 2024 presidential debate. Following the debate, CNN reported criticism of Biden's performance by some Democrats, with one Democratic strategist dubbing it a \"disaster\" and another as \"nothing good\".[148] His performance led to an increase in questions over Biden's health and age, and whether or not he should remain as the presidential candidate for the Democratic Party.[149][150]\n\nDemocratic primaries\n\nBiden faced opposition during the 2024 Democratic Party presidential primaries from U.S. Representative Dean Phillips. Biden was not on the ballot on January 23, New Hampshire primary, but won the state in a write-in campaign with 63.8% of the vote and strongly defeated Representative Phillips, who garnered 19.6% of the vote.[151] Biden had wanted South Carolina to be the first primary, and won that state on February 3 with 96% of the vote.[152] Biden received 89.3% of the vote in Nevada and 81.1% of the vote in Michigan, with \"None of these Candidates\" and \"Uncommitted\" coming in second, respectively. On Super Tuesday 2024, Biden won 15 of 16 contests, netting 80% or more of the primary vote in 13 of the 16 contests.[153][154] Biden lost the American Samoa contest to venture capitalist Jason Palmer, becoming the first incumbent president to lose a contest while appearing on the ballot since Jimmy Carter in 1980.[155][156] On March 6, Representative Phillips suspended his campaign and endorsed Biden.[157] On March 12, with wins in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington, he reached the 1,968 delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination, becoming the presumptive nominee.[158]\n\nEndorsements\n\nOpposition among Arab and Muslim Americans\n\nA protestor in Columbus, Ohio, carrying a sign referring to Biden as \"Genocide Joe\"\n\nIn reaction to the Biden administration's response to the Israel\u2013Hamas war, a vocal minority of progressives,[159] Muslim, and Arab American leaders have disrupted events and formed protest votes in swing states through the #AbandonBiden campaign, which encourages voters in the United States to not vote for Biden as a form of protest of his support for Israel.[160][161] The organization leaders said they would not support Donald Trump, but would not vote for Biden either.[162] On December 30, 2023, the #AbandonBiden campaign announced its countrywide expansion.[163] James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute, argued that Arab American opposition to Biden was due to his \"insensitivity\" to Palestinian suffering.[164] Biden voiced support for the right to protest but criticized when they became violent or antisemitic.[165]\n\nBiden's support of Israel has prompted opposition from Muslim Americans and Arab Americans, particularly in Michigan, which has a large Muslim population and a large Arab population.[166][167] Mayor Abdullah Hammoud of Dearborn refused to meet with Biden's campaign in January 2024 because he said the lives of Palestinians are not measured in poll numbers.[168] Hammoud later joined 30 state legislators and members of the Wayne County Commission to put pressure on Biden.[169] U.S. Representative Rashida Tlaib, the only Palestinian American in Congress, also called for Michigan Democrats to vote \"uncommitted\" in the state primary.[170][171][172] Due to Michigan's status as a swing state, some analysts have said that Biden's support of Israel could cause him to lose not only the state, but also the election.[173][174] Some major Democratic Party donors criticized Biden's policies in Gaza, saying they were imperiling his presidential bid.[175] By May 2024, several progressive groups critical of Biden's Gaza policy began anti-Trump campaigns that were noted to indirectly help Biden.[176]\n\nWithdrawal\n\nCalls to withdraw\n\nBiden announcing that he will not run for re-election\n\nBiden faced calls from both pundits and fellow Democrats to withdraw from the race due to concerns about his health and age, his polling numbers against Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump, and his low approval ratings, which have stayed below 44% since August 2021.[177][178] On a couple of occasions during the 2020 campaign Biden called himself a \"bridge candidate\", leading some to believe he would not seek a second term.[179] When Biden first took office at the age of 78 on January 20, 2021, he became the oldest person to have served as president of the United States.[180] Calls from Biden supporters to step aside months or years before the debate were made by James Carville,[181] Ezra Klein,[182] and the Economist.[183] On July 28, 2022, U.S. Representative Dean Phillips became the first incumbent Democratic member of Congress to say President Biden should not run for re-election and called for \"generational change,\" pointing to Biden's age.[184] Suggestions on who could replace Biden include Kamala Harris,[185] and governors Gavin Newsom of California, Jared Polis of Colorado, J. B. Pritzker of Illinois, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan.[186][187] On October 27, 2023, Minnesota Congressman Dean Phillips formally launched his presidential campaign for the Democratic nomination. Phillips argued during his campaign that the president would be a weak general election candidate due to his age and low approval ratings.[188] Biden and his campaign have deflected these concerns, demonstrating that he intends to stay in the race.[189] Jaime Harrison, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, called the idea of replacing Biden \"certifiably crazy\" in a tweet in February 2024.[190] By March 2024, the majority of Democratic officials, politicians, and strategists coalesced around Biden as their nominee,[159] especially following his 2024 State of the Union Address.[191]\n\nAfter a widely perceived poor performance during the first 2024 presidential debate on June 27, several Democratic officials and political pundits called on Biden to step aside as the nominee.[192][193] Other prominent Democrats, including former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton as well as Senators John Fetterman,[194][195] Bernie Sanders,[196][197] Tammy Duckworth,[195] and Chris Coons[198][195] rallied behind Biden, and resisted calls for him to step down due to one \"bad debate.\"[199] Other influential Democrats[200] and the editorial boards including The New York Times,[201] The Boston Globe,[202] the Chicago Tribune,[203] The New Yorker,[204] The Economist[178][204] and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution[205] called for Biden to suspend his presidential campaign. The New Republic described a widespread view among voters that Biden should step aside.[206]\n\nResponse by Biden\n\nBiden repudiated any possibility of him dropping out, saying only \"the Lord Almighty\" could convince him to drop out in an interview with ABC News held on July 5, after the first debate. Biden further affirmed his intent on staying in the race at a campaign rally in Madison, Wisconsin.[213] On July 5, Biden met with Democratic governors across the country with the majority saying he should also remain in the race.[213] He wrote a letter to Congressional Democrats on July 8, reiterating that he would not end his candidacy.[214] The same day, he called in to the MSNBC show Morning Joe and called for any prospective challengers to \"run against me. Announce for president, challenge me at the convention.\u201d[215] On July 11, Biden responded to a question whether he would step aside if polling data showed Kamala had a better chance of beating Trump by saying that he would only step aside if he had zero chance of beating Trump.[216]\n\nConferences\n\nThe Washington Post reported that U.S. Senator Mark Warner of Virginia was attempting to assemble a group of Democratic Senators to pressure Biden to withdraw from the race.[217] On July 7, top Democrats, including minority house leader Hakeem Jeffries, held a rare party conference on the matter.[218] On July 9, the full House Democratic Caucus and the Senate Democratic Caucus each held respective meetings to discuss Biden's place on the ticket.[219]\n\nOn July 11, 2024, Biden held an hour-long solo press conference following the NATO 2024 Washington summit in order to demonstrate his capability to face Donald Trump in the 2024 election.[220] Notably, Biden made two major gaffes, mistakenly introducing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as \"President Putin\",[221] and then accidentally referring to Vice President Kamala Harris as \"Vice President Trump.\"[222] Later that evening House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries met with Biden expressing \"the full breadth of insight, heartfelt perspectives and conclusions about the path forward that the Caucus\" discussed earlier in the week.[223]\n\nOn July 13, 2024, following the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, Biden campaign officials promised to limit public campaign messaging and take down all TV campaign advertisements as soon as possible.[224]\n\nAnnouncement of withdrawal\n\nOn July 21, following weeks of public and private pressure, Biden announced that he was withdrawing from the race, writing \"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term\". He endorsed Harris as his replacement.[225]\n\nMy Fellow Americans, Over the past three and a half years, we have made great progress as a Nation. Today, America has the strongest economy in the world. We've made historic investments in rebuilding our Nation, in lowering prescription drug costs for seniors, and in expanding affordable health care to a record number of Americans. We've provided critically needed care to a million veterans exposed to toxic substances. Passed the first gun safety law in 30 years. Appointed the first African American woman to the Supreme Court. And passed the most significant climate legislation in the history of the world. America has never been better positioned to lead than we are today. I know none of this could have been done without you, the American people. Together, we overcame a once in a century pandemic and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. We've protected and preserved our Democracy. And we've revitalized and strengthened our alliances around the world. It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term. I will speak to the Nation later this week in more detail about my decision. For now, let me express my deepest gratitude to all those who have worked so hard to see me reelected. I want to thank Vice President Kamala Harris for being an extraordinary partner in all this work. And let me express my heartfelt appreciation to the American people for the faith and trust you have placed in me. I believe today what I always have: that there is nothing America can't do - when we do it together. We just have to remember we are the United States of America. \u2014 Joe Biden\n\nOn the evening of July 24, Biden addressed the nation from the Oval Office, explaining his decision to withdraw from the race, and outlining his priorities for the final months of his term.[226]\n\nPolling\n\nPrimary election\n\nGeneral election\n\nSee also",

In the meantime, Trump has pivoted his focus from Biden to Harris.\n\nPennsylvania, a key battleground state for this election, could accept ballots in just 50 days.

        "text": "Venezuela election: Maduro declared winner in disputed vote\nVenezuela's Maduro declared winner in disputed vote\n\nVenezuela election: Maduro declared winner in disputed vote\n\nPresident Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has won Venezuela's presidential election, according to partial results announced by the electoral council. The head of the National Electoral Council (CNE), Elvis Amoroso - who is a close ally of Mr Maduro - said that with 80% of ballots counted, President Maduro had 51% of the vote, compared to 44% for his main rival. The Venezuelan opposition dismissed the CNE's announcement as fraudulent and promised to challenge the result. It said its candidate, Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, had won with 70% of the votes and insisted he was the rightful president-elect.\n\nThe opposition said vote tallies it had received, as well as quick counts, showed Mr Gonz\u00e1lez had a lead of 40 percentage points over the incumbent. Opposition parties had united behind Mr Gonz\u00e1lez in an attempt to unseat President Maduro after 11 years in power. Opinion polls conducted ahead of the election had suggested Mr Gonz\u00e1lez would roundly defeat the president.\n\nReuters Opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado said Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez was the rightful president-elect\n\nThe result of the election will have repercussions well beyond the South American country of 29.4 million inhabitants. Over the past 10 years, 7.8 million people have fled Venezuela because of the economic and political crisis into which the country was plunged under the Maduro Administration. Polls conducted in the run-up to the election suggest that exodus could now increase, with one poll suggesting a third of the population would emigrate. With immigration a hot topic in the US election, the government in Washington, as well as Latin American nations to which Venezuelans have emigrated en masse, are affected by what happens in the Andean country. Who Venezuela does business with also matters because it has the world's biggest oil reserve. Mr Maduro blames US sanctions for his country's economic woes and has forged close alliances with China, Iran, and Russia - nations which also have a thorny relationship with the US. A change of government could see Venezuela turn away from these countries as well as from its close ally, Cuba, while Mr Maduro is expected to deepen his ties with his allies should he stay in power. Many Venezuelans were adamant that they wanted change after 25 years in which the socialist PSUV party has been in power - first under the leadership of the late President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, and after his death from cancer in 2013, under Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. In the queue at one polling station in Petare, a poor neighbourhood in the capital, Caracas, many people said they were voting for \u201cchange\u201d. \u201cThis government has had all the opportunities to make Venezuela a great country, but instead we have misery,\u201d a voter called Paulo told BBC reporter Ione Wells. \u201cOur children have to go through a jungle, the Dari\u00e9n Gap, to the US. There are many dead Venezuelans in the jungle. Our children are dying.\u201d There was widespread fear that the government could resort to fraud to win the election. Mr Maduro's win in 2018 was also widely dismissed as neither free nor fair. However, the opposition had hoped its lead would be so convincing, it would thwart any attempts by the Maduro administration to \"steal the election\". One community leader, Katiuska Camargo, said for many years people did not turn out in such large numbers because \u201cthere was so much collective disappointment\" but that now people were \"determined that these people leave power immediately\".\n\nGetty In Caracas, a group of opposition supporters held hands in protest to be let in to count the votes",

        "text": "Venezuela standoff as Maduro declared winner of presidential election but opposition claims landslide victory\nCaracas, Venezuela \u2014 Venezuela's opposition claimed victory in Sunday's presidential election, setting up a showdown with the government, which earlier declared President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro the winner.\n\n\"Venezuelans and the entire world know what happened,\" opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez said in his first remarks.\n\nOpposition leader Maria Corina Machado said the margin of Gonz\u00e1lez's victory was \"overwhelming\" based on voting tallies it had received from campaign representatives from about 40% of ballot boxes nationwide.\n\nOpposition leader Maria Corina Machado and presidential candidate Edmundo Gonzalez hold a press conference after electoral authorities declared President Nicolas Maduro the winner of the presidential election in Caracas, Venezuela, on July 29, 2024. Matias Delacroix / AP\n\nThe National Electoral Council, which is controlled by Maduro loyalists, earlier said Maduro had secured 51% of the vote to 44% for Gonz\u00e1lez. But it didn't release the tallies from each of the 30,000 polling booths nationwide, only promising to do so in the \"coming hours,\" hampering the ability to verify the results.\n\nOther nations voice doubts about official results\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking in Tokyo, said the U.S. has \"serious concerns that the result announced does not reflect the will or the votes of the Venezuelan people.\"\n\nForeign leaders held off recognizing the results.\n\n\"The Maduro regime should understand that the results it published are difficult to believe,\" said Gabriel Boric, the leftist leader of Chile. \"We won't recognize any result that is not verifiable.\"\n\nGuatemalan President Bernardo Arevalo said, \"We receive the results announced by the CNE (electoral authority) with many doubts,\" the Reuters news agency reports.\n\nReuters quotes Uruguayan President Luis Lacalle Pou as saying, \"It was an open secret. They were going to 'win' regardless of the actual results.\"\n\nItaly and Spain were among other countries indicating concern about the truth of the announced official results.\n\nBut China congratulated Maduro on his win, and Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel said he spoke with Maduro to congratulate him on his \"historic\" victory, according to Agence France-Presse.\n\nThe delay in announcing results - six hours after polls were supposed to close - indicated a deep debate inside the government about how to proceed after Maduro's opponents came out early in the evening all but claiming victory.\n\nWhen Maduro finally came out to celebrate the results, he accused unidentified foreign enemies of trying to hack the voting system.\n\n\"This is not the first time that they have tried to violate the peace of the republic,\" he said to a few hundred supporters at the presidential palace. He provided no evidence to back the claim but promised \"justice\" for those who try to stir violence in Venezuela.\n\nPresident Nicolas Maduro addresses supporters gathered outside the Miraflores presidential palace after electoral authorities declared him the winner of the presidential election in Caracas, Venezuela, on July 29, 2024. Fernando Vergara / AP\n\nMaduro, in seeking a third term, faced his toughest challenge yet from the unlikeliest of opponents in Gonz\u00e1lez: a retired diplomat who was unknown to voters before being tapped in April as a last-minute stand-in for Machado, considered a powerhouse.\n\nEarlier, opposition supporters celebrated, online and outside a few voting centers, what they assured was a landslide victory for Gonz\u00e1lez.\n\n\"I'm so happy,\" said Merling Fern\u00e1ndez, a 31-year-old bank employee, as a representative for the opposition campaign walked out of one voting center in a working class neighborhood of Caracas to announce results showing Gonz\u00e1lez more than doubling Maduro's vote count. Dozens standing nearby erupted in an impromptu rendition of the national anthem.\n\n\"This is the path toward a new Venezuela,\" added Fern\u00e1ndez, holding back tears. \"We are all tired of this yoke.\"\n\nVoters started lining up at some voting centers across the country before dawn Sunday, sharing water, coffee and snacks for several hours.\n\nResults will have broad impact\n\nThe election will have ripple effects throughout the Americas, with government opponents and supporters alike signaling their interest in joining the exodus of 7.7 million Venezuelans who have already left their homes for opportunities abroad in anticipation of Maduro winning another six year term.\n\nAuthorities set Sunday's election to coincide with what would have been the 70th birthday of former President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the revered leftist firebrand who died of cancer in 2013, leaving his Bolivarian revolution in the hands of Maduro. But Maduro and his United Socialist Party of Venezuela are more unpopular than ever among many voters who blame his policies for crushing wages, spurring hunger, crippling the oil industry and separating families due to migration.\n\nThe opposition managed to line up behind a single candidate after years of intraparty divisions and election boycotts that torpedoed their ambitions to topple the ruling party.\n\nMachado was blocked by the Maduro-controlled supreme court from running for any office for 15 years. A former lawmaker, she swept the opposition's October primary with over 90% of the vote. After she was prevented from joining the presidential race, she chose a college professor as her substitute on the ballot, but the National Electoral Council also barred her from registering. That's when Gonz\u00e1lez, a political newcomer, was chosen.\n\nSunday's ballot also featured eight other candidates challenging Maduro, but only Gonz\u00e1lez threatens Maduro's rule.\n\nAfter voting, Maduro said he would recognize the election result and urged all other candidates to publicly declare that they would do the same.\n\n\"No one is going to create chaos in Venezuela,\" Maduro said. \"I recognize and will recognize the electoral referee, the official announcements and I will make sure they are recognized.\"\n\nEconomy central in unrest \u2014 and election\n\nVenezuela sits atop the world's largest proven oil reserves, and once boasted Latin America's most advanced economy. But it entered into a freefall after Maduro took the helm. Plummeting oil prices, widespread shortages and hyperinflation that soared past 130,000% led first to social unrest and then to mass emigration.\n\nEconomic sanctions from the U.S. seeking to force Maduro from power after his 2018 reelection - which the U.S. and dozens of other countries condemned as illegitimate - only deepened the crisis.\n\nMaduro's pitch to voters this election was one of economic security, which he tried to sell with stories of entrepreneurship and references to a stable currency exchange and lower inflation rates. The International Monetary Fund forecasts the economy will grow 4% this year - one of the fastest in Latin America - after having shrunk 71% from 2012 to 2020.\n\nBut most Venezuelans haven't seen any improvement in their quality of life. Many earn under $200 a month, which means families struggle to afford essential items. Some work second and third jobs. A basket of basic staples - sufficient to feed a family of four for a month - costs an estimated $385.\n\nThe opposition has tried to seize on the huge inequalities arising from the crisis, during which Venezuelans abandoned their country's currency, the bolivar, for the U.S. dollar.\n\nGonz\u00e1lez and Machado focused much of their campaigning on Venezuela's vast hinterland, where the economic activity seen in Caracas in recent years didn't materialize. They promised a government that would create sufficient jobs to attract Venezuelans living abroad to return home and reunite with their families.",

        "text": "Maduro and opposition both claim victory in Venezuela's presidential election\nMaduro and opposition both claim victory in Venezuela's presidential election\n\ntoggle caption Fernando Vergara/AP\n\nBOGOTA, Colombia \u2014 Electoral authorities claimed that Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, Venezuela\u2019s deeply unpopular president, had won a third term in Sunday\u2019s election, sparking accusations that his authoritarian regime had committed massive fraud to steal victory from opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez.\n\nAfter hours of delays and uncertainty, Elvis Amoroso, president of the National Electoral Council and a close Maduro ally, appeared before journalists shortly after midnight on Monday. He declared that Maduro had won with 51% compared to 44% for Gonz\u00e1lez, with 80% of the votes counted.\n\nHowever, opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado insisted that Gonz\u00e1lez, a 74-year-old retired diplomat who took Machado\u2019s place on the presidential ballot when the regime banned her from running, had won 70% of the vote compared to 30% for Maduro.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cVenezuela has a new president, and he is Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez,\u201d Machado told a crowded news conference in Caracas.\n\nAs evidence, Machado cited several exit polls and quick counts showing Gonz\u00e1lez heading toward a landslide victory, as well as paper receipts from voting machines. An exit poll published by the U.S. firm Edison Research showed Gonz\u00e1lez leading Maduro 65% to 31% while nearly all pre-election polls predicted that he would trounce Maduro.\n\n\u201cWe won in every demographic, in every state,\u201d Machado said. \u201cIt was overwhelming. We won and the whole world knows this. Even the regime knows what happened.\u201d\n\nThe National Electoral Council waited for six hours after the polls closed to announce Maduro\u2019s victory, indicating that his inner circle may have been debating how to handle the results. After his regime failed to derail the opposition campaign through dirty tricks and by banning Machado, many political analysts believed that Maduro would resort to stealing the election.\n\n\u201c100% predictable,\u201d Eric Farnsworth, vice president of the Council of the Americas think tank, said of Maduro\u2019s claim to victory.\n\nMaduro, 61, was first elected in 2013 following the death of his mentor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who founded Venezuela\u2019s socialist revolution in 1999. But Maduro is widely despised for leading Venezuela into its worst economic crisis in history which prompted nearly 8 million Venezuelans, about a quarter of the population, to flee the country. He has also been indicted by the U.S. for drug trafficking and terrorism while his regime is being investigated by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cI have a clean conscience,\u201d Maduro told supporters gathered at the Miraflores presidential palace. \u201cIn this new term that you have given me, I pledge that I will put my life on the line to transform Venezuela and lead us toward a prosperous future of economic growth, peace and social happiness.\u201d\n\nThe Biden administration, which has threatened to reimpose sanctions on Venezuela\u2019s vital oil industry, and other foreign governments immediately cried foul.\n\n\u201cWe have serious concerns that the result announced does not reflect the will or the votes of the Venezuelan people,\" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. \"It's critical that every vote is counted fairly and transparently, that election officials immediately share information with the opposition and electoral observers without delay and that the electoral authorities publish detailed tabulation of votes.\"\n\nChilean President Gabriel Boric wrote on X: \u201cThe Maduro regime must understand that the results they have published are difficult to believe. Chile will not recognize any results that cannot be verified.\u201d\n\nBrazil, Colombia and other Latin American nations expressed similar concerns.\n\nAnger and frustration with Maduro was evident on Sunday, with several regime loyalists loudly booed when they showed up at polling places to vote. Confident that Gonz\u00e1lez would win, some Venezuelans chanted what has become a popular opposition slogan: \u201cIt\u2019s going to fall. It\u2019s going to fall. This regime is going to fall!\u201d\n\ntoggle caption Cristian Hernandez/AP\n\nSome Venezuelans were so eager to cast their ballots for the opposition that they lined up at polling places the night before the election. Elidio Santana, who sells bottled water on the streets of Caracas, stood in line for four hours to vote for Gonz\u00e1lez.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting for 25 years\u201d for a change of government, Santana said, adding that a few more hours wouldn\u2019t matter. \u201cWe are fed up. This country needs a change.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nOf the estimated 5.5 million voting-age Venezuelans living abroad, only about 69,000 were able to register to vote due to red tape put in place by the Maduro regime. One migrant who did manage to vote was Carolina Mart\u00ednez, a 50-year-old nurse who lives in neighboring Colombia but returned to Venezuela to cast her ballot. She predicted that a Gonz\u00e1lez victory would convince Venezuelans living abroad to repatriate.\n\n\u201cA lot of people want to come back to Venezuela and to see their homeland prosper again,\u201d said Mart\u00ednez, whose four sons also live abroad.\n\nBut with both sides claiming victory, Venezuela could face an extended period of unrest as many opposition supporters pledged to protest in the streets. Gonz\u00e1lez urged them to be peaceful as the opposition goes about gathering evidence, such as the paper receipts from voting machines, that he won the election.\n\n\u201cOur fight will continue,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez told a news conference early Monday. \u201cWe won\u2019t stop until the will of the people is respected.\n\nCarrie Kahn contributed from Caracas.",

        "text": "Iran using covert influence campaign to undermine Trump candidacy, US intelligence says\nCNN \u2014\n\nIran is using covert social media activity and related influence operations in an effort to undercut the candidacy of former President Donald Trump, a US intelligence official said Monday in an updated assessment of threats to the November election.\n\nThe US intelligence community has \u201cobserved Tehran working to influence the presidential election, probably because Iranian leaders want to avoid an outcome they perceive would increase tensions with the United States,\u201d the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) said in a statement.\n\nThe recent Iranian influence activity has come in the form of \u201ccovert social media accounts and related activity,\u201d the official from ODNI said at a media briefing when CNN asked for examples of the activity.\n\nIran\u2019s preference for a US presidential candidate has not changed since 2020, the ODNI official said. In the 2020 election campaign, Iran \u201ccarried out a multi-pronged covert influence campaign intended to undercut former President Trump\u2019s reelection prospects,\u201d according to a declassified US intelligence report.\n\nRussia\u2019s preferences for the presidential race also haven\u2019t shifted since 2020, when Moscow conducted a range of influence operations in support of Trump and aimed at denigrating Joe Biden, the ODNI official said.\n\n\u201cIran does not engage in any objectives or activities intended to influence the U.S. election,\u201d the Iranian Permanent Mission to the United Nations said in a statement to CNN. \u201cA significant portion of such accusations are characterized by psychological operations designed to artificially pep up election campaigns.\u201d\n\nAs president, Trump ordered the killing of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, and withdrew from a multilateral deal aimed at curbing Tehran\u2019s nuclear program. Iran has vowed revenge for Soleimani\u2019s death.\n\nThe alleged Iranian threats to the Trump candidacy have not just been online.\n\nUS authorities obtained intelligence from a human source in recent weeks on a plot by Iran to try to assassinate Trump, a development that led to the Secret Service increasing security around the former president, CNN first reported on July 16. There\u2019s no indication that Thomas Matthew Crooks, the would-be assassin who attempted to kill the former president at a rally in Pennsylvania on July 13, was connected to the Iranian plot.\n\nIran has denied the assassination plot allegations.\n\nForeign influence actors have used the attempted assassination of Trump \u201cas part of their narratives, portraying the event to fit their broader goals,\u201d the ODNI official said without offering examples.\n\nIran is also attempting to covertly stoke protests in the US related to the Israel-Hamas conflict by posing as activists online and in some cases providing financial support to protesters, US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said this month.\n\n\u201cTehran relies on vast webs of online personas and propaganda mills to spread disinformation and have notably been active in exacerbating tensions over the Israel-Gaza conflict,\u201d the ODNI said in its statement on Monday.\n\nRussia is the \u2018predominant threat\u2019 to US elections\n\nThe updated intelligence assessment covers a range of covert and overt influence activity, showing that the number of foreign actors targeting US elections has continued to grow since the Kremlin\u2019s sweeping effort to influence the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cRussia remains the predominant threat to U.S. elections,\u201d ODNI said in its assessment on Monday. Moscow is using Russia-based \u201cinfluence-for-hire\u201d firms that are getting better at tailoring content to American audiences, US officials said.\n\nCNN has requested comment from the Russian Embassy in Washington, DC. The Russian government regularly denies US allegations of election influence.\n\nChina \u201cprobably does not plan to influence the outcome\u201d of the US presidential election, but US intelligence is monitoring the possibility that China-linked propagandists and influence actors could \u201cdenigrate down-ballot candidates,\u201d the updated assessment says.\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping told Biden that China would not interfere in the 2024 US presidential election when the two men met in November, CNN previously reported.",

I will not rest until we have delivered the strong, safe and prosperous America that our children deserve and that you deserve. This will truly be the golden age of America.\u201d\n\nTrump is now just the second defeated president in history to win a nonconsecutive term. The Republican surpassed 270 electoral votes with projected wins in the battleground states of Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nCNN also projects that Republicans will win back control of the Senate, shifting the balance of power in Washington.\n\nHarris was hoping to become the nation\u2019s first-ever female president. She became the Democratic Party\u2019s nominee this summer, not long after Biden\u2019s unprecedented exit from the race. Biden bowed out in July, a few weeks after a disastrous debate performance that had Democratic allies calling for him to step aside and \u201cpass the torch\u201d for the good of the party and the country.\n\nTrump\u2019s victory comes in the same year that he was convicted of a felony and escaped two attempts on his life. In July, eight days before Biden dropped out, Trump was shot in the ear during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nAs the election draws to a close, we look back at the extraordinary events that have shaped this race.",

        "text": "July 29, 2024, presidential campaign news\nFar from the boring rematch that had many Americans tuning out politics, the 2024 presidential election has had wild twists and scary turns.\n\nNobody expected President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign to implode in less than a month, from the shock of his performance at CNN\u2019s debate in late June to his decision to step aside in the race in late July. Democrats went from literally freaking out about his candidacy to a new excitement about Vice President Kamala Harris as his replacement.\n\nNobody expected an assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump, an event that unified Republicans around him and has many in his party showing a sort of divine reverence for his near-death experience.\n\nSo we don\u2019t know specifically what will happen in the sprint to Election Day on November 5, or what could come after, when the country\u2019s unique Electoral College process gets going. But we do have some idea of what to expect:\n\nAugust: Nominating Harris, picking a VP and a convention in Chicago: While the Democratic Party almost immediately rallied around Harris as its nominee, it still needs to officially select her. Delegates will do that in short order, between August 1 and August 7, before the convention, a backstop maneuver to ward against ballot changes.\n\nHarris will also need to pick a running mate. Look for that to occur soon, according to CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny, and not right before the convention, as frequently occurs.\n\nIn late August, Democrats will convene in Chicago for their convention. Expect the most incredible reception for Biden. Democrats have pivoted from worrying over his election prospects to lionizing him as a hero.\n\nEarlier in the month, Sen. JD Vance, Trump\u2019s running mate, turns 40. He\u2019d be the third-youngest vice president in US history and the first millennial in nationwide elected office if the Republican ticket wins. With Biden out of the race, Vance is on the ticket with the oldest major-party nominee in history with Trump, a baby boomer.\n\nRead more about what to expect with the presidential election less than 100 days away.",

Here are the details of the aggregate surveys\nResults of the aggregate surveys:\n\n\n\nTrump vs Biden:\n\n\n\nToo close to call?\n\n\n\nFAQs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(You can now subscribe to our\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel\n\nIt has been a week since US President Joe Biden ended his election campaign. Since then, Vice-President Kamala Harris is all set to receive a presidential nomination from the Democratic Party. She has attracted the support of many delegates, received more than $250 million in donations and been endorsed by many of the top law makers including Joe Biden himself.While she has managed to gain the support from her party members, how does she perform against Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump ? The results of three major aggregate polls have been published. The results are indicative of a shifting political narrative in the US. It shows a close competition between Harris and Trump.There is barely 100 days left for the presidential election and the results published by the New York Times, The Hill and Real Clear Politics have all given Trump, a marginal lead over Biden.Among the three polls, Real Clear Politics shows the smallest gap between the two candidates. Trump received the support of 47.9% of the respondents and Harris received the support of 46.2% of the respondents. Trump had a 1.7% lead over Harris.The New York Times gave Trump a lead over Harris by just 2 points. While 48% of the respondents supported Trump, 46% of the supporters supported Harris.Finally, The Hill showed that Trump garnered the support of 48% of the electorate in comparison to Harris who received the support of 45.9% of the respondents, indicating a lead of just 2.1%.In the same surveys, before his exit, Trump had a greater lead over the incumbent president. It is these surveys that led to Biden\u2019s exit. The Real Clear Politics showed that Biden was trailing behind Trump by 3.1%.In the New York Times, Trump had a lead of an additional one percentage point over Biden. He had a lead of 3% over Biden. The survey by The Hill showed Trump leading by 3.3% against Biden.One of the surveys with the largest sample size of 11,297 registered voters, conducted by the Morning Consult found that Trump had 1% lead over Harris and this increased to 2% in the Reuters/Ipsos poll survey. Most of these surveys have a margin of error of at least 1-2%. This shows that the results of the upcoming presidential election may be too close to call.A candidate can win the popular vote but still lose the electoral college vote. Most recently, this has happened in 2016 when Hilary Clinton lost to Donald Trump. In 2000 too, this happened and it happened three times in the 19century.The US President is elected indirectly by the Electoral College. The people vote for the candidate of their choice in both the presidential and the vice-presidential elections. However, the electoral college consisting of representatives from the states meet in December and decide the fate of these candidates.",

        "text": "Can Trump Vote Now That He Has Felony Convictions?\nAfter Donald Trump became the first former president to be convicted of a crime, many believed that the Florida resident would be barred from voting in the 2024 election because of the state\u2019s harsh felony disenfranchisement law, which denies voting rights to more than 1 million people. However, Trump\u2019s eligibility to cast a ballot this fall will depend on how he is sentenced in New York for falsifying business records.\n\nHis ability to vote in Florida could also be affected by the prosecutions against him in Georgia state court and federal courts in Florida and Washington, DC, although those trials are unlikely to happen before the election.\n\nCan Trump vote in the 2024 election?\n\nYes, unless he is incarcerated for his felonies in New York at the time of the election or convicted of a felony in another jurisdiction that takes away his right to vote in that jurisdiction. Trump is a Florida resident, and Florida law says that a person convicted in another state can vote in Florida if they are allowed to vote in that other state. Since he was convicted in a New York state court, his eligibility to vote in Florida is governed by New York\u2019s law, which allows everyone who\u2019s not currently serving a sentence in prison to vote.\n\nAccording to the Florida Division of Elections, \u201ca felony conviction in another state makes a person ineligible to vote in Florida only if the conviction would make the person ineligible to vote in the state where the person was convicted.\u201d\n\nTrump has been convicted of felonies in New York and under New York state law, so New York law will determine his eligibility to vote in Florida. Under New York law, a person convicted of a felony is disenfranchised only while incarcerated for that felony. Thus, Trump will be able to vote as long as he is not incarcerated for his New York felonies at the time of the election.\n\nIf Trump can vote so long as he\u2019s not in prison, why are so many other Floridians with past convictions who are living in the community disenfranchised?\n\nFlorida treats residents convicted of a felony in the state differently than residents convicted of a felony out of state. Under Florida law, people convicted of a felony other than murder or a felony sexual offense in a Florida state or federal court are disenfranchised during any term of incarceration, probation, parole, or other forms of community supervision and until they have paid off any fines, fees, court costs, and restitution ordered by the court at the time of sentencing. Therefore, had Trump been convicted in Florida, he would have been barred from voting unless he had completed all the terms of his sentence \u2014 including payment of any related court debts \u2014 or had his voting rights restored by the state\u2019s clemency board.\n\nThe Brennan Center supports the right to vote for everyone who\u2019s living in the community, and that includes Trump. The fact that he likely will be able to vote \u2014 while the more than 1 million Floridians living in the community will be denied that right simply because they were convicted in Florida \u2014 demonstrates the injustice in the state\u2019s approach.\n\nAdditionally, the difficulty of determining Trump\u2019s voter eligibility shows how complicated it can be for any Florida resident to understand their own. This confusing system underscores the unfairness of the state\u2019s prosecutions of dozens of people who were confused or misled about their eligibility to vote.\n\nWould Trump be eligible to vote in the fall if he\u2019s convicted of a felony in Georgia or federal court?\n\nIt depends on which case results in a conviction, although a completed trial in any of them before the election is highly unlikely. Trump has two active prosecutions related to his role in the attempt to overturn the 2020 election: one in federal court in Washington and the other in Georgia state court. His prosecution in Florida federal court for his alleged mishandling of classified documents was dismissed by Judge Aileen Cannon on July 15.\n\nIf Trump were found guilty of another felony in the DC federal court case, his voting eligibility would be unaffected because people convicted of a felony in DC do not lose the right to vote.\n\nA Georgia state felony conviction, by contrast, would likely disenfranchise Trump unless he was pardoned by the state\u2019s governor or had his voting rights restored by Florida\u2019s clemency board. Georgia law establishes that people convicted of a felony cannot vote during any period of incarceration, probation, or parole and unless they\u2019ve fully paid any fines for that felony.\n\nA federal conviction in Florida would likely disenfranchise Trump as well unless he was pardoned by the president or had his voting rights restored by the state\u2019s clemency board, as people convicted of a felony other than murder or a felony sex offense in Florida are barred from voting during any period of incarceration, probation, or community control and unless they\u2019ve fully paid any fines, fees, court costs, and restitution ordered by the court at the time of sentencing.\n\nCould Florida\u2019s clemency board intervene if Trump does become ineligible to vote?\n\nAfter the news of Trump\u2019s conviction, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said that the Florida Clemency Board, which is made up of DeSantis and the three members of his cabinet, would step in to restore the former president\u2019s voting rights if needed. The clemency board could probably follow through on that promise.\n\nIf Trump were in prison for his New York convictions at the time of the election (which appears unlikely), he would not be eligible to vote in Florida unless the clemency board restored his voting rights. The Rules of Executive Clemency require people with out-of-state or federal convictions to complete all nonfinancial terms of their sentence, including any term of incarceration or supervision, before they can apply to have their rights restored. The rules also limit restoration to those who do not have pending criminal charges. Thus, if Trump were incarcerated at the time of the election for his New York felonies or any of his prosecutions were active, he would not be eligible to apply to have his voting rights restored.\n\nThat said, the clemency board has broad authority to restore civil rights under Florida law to people with out-of-state or federal felonies. Its rules give the governor \u201cunfettered discretion to require at any time that an individual matter be treated under other provisions of these rules, whether or not the person satisfies the eligibility requirements of a particular rule.\u201d So DeSantis could bend the rules to allow Trump to apply even if he otherwise would not be eligible to do so. Trump\u2019s application would then have to be approved by DeSantis and at least two other members of the clemency board.\n\nAre all states\u2019 rules for voting after a felony conviction as confusing as Florida\u2019s?\n\nNo. However, the variation between states causes immense confusion among voters and election officials alike. Maine, Vermont, and Washington, DC, have the simplest rules because they never take the right to vote away, followed by the 23 states that disenfranchise people convicted of felonies only while they are incarcerated. In the remaining 25 states, people can remain disenfranchised after release from prison, and their eligibility to vote can depend on a number of factors, such as the type of offense or the type of fines or fees that they owe.",

        "text": "How Presidential Polling Got Its Start\nThe first U.S. presidential poll to use modern statistical methods was a Gallup poll in 1936. But the first known presidential straw polls date to 1824\u2014over a century before.\n\nThese early straw polls were regional and informal. Newspapers reported the results as information about local opinions rather than possible predictions about how the national election might play out.\n\nLocal straw polls continued throughout the 19th century. Then in 1916, The Literary Digest launched a national presidential poll. The magazine\u2019s methods were flawed, but for five consecutive presidential races, the winner of The Literary Digest poll was also the winner of the actual election.\n\nThis streak ended in 1936, when George Gallup predicted Franklin D. Roosevelt would win reelection and The Literary Digest said he wouldn\u2019t. Gallup\u2019s poll was a victory for statistical survey methods, and paved the way for modern presidential polling.\n\nPresidential Election Facts\n\nThe 1824 Election\n\nThe 1824 presidential election was unique in many ways. The caucus system that U.S. politicians had thus far used to nominate candidates had fallen out of favor, and politicians struggled to adopt a new nomination process (the national party convention didn\u2019t debut until 1831). The country\u2019s first party system had also fallen apart, so the only candidates to choose from were Democratic-Republicans\u2014and there were four of them running at the same time in the general election.\n\nIn this chaotic situation, white male voters began to take straw polls to see who others were voting for. They took these polls at all types of gatherings: militia assemblies, grand juries, Fourth of July celebrations and elections for other offices. We know about these polls because newspapers reported on their results. In contrast to today, newspapers didn\u2019t frame these results as predictive of the national election.\n\n\u201cI think people took this as interesting and informative, but not in any sense definitive,\u201d says Tom W. Smith, director of NORC\u2019s Center for the Study of Politics & Society, who has written about the 1824 straw polls for The Public Opinion Quarterly.\n\nIt would\u2019ve been hard for any poll to predict what happened in the 1824 election, anyway. Andrew Jackson won the most popular and electoral votes; but because he didn\u2019t win the majority of electoral votes, the U.S. Constitution dictated that the U.S. House of Representatives choose the president. The House elected John Quincy Adams, who had come in second in the popular and electoral votes (the other runners-up were William H. Crawford and Henry Clay).\n\nAlthough newspapers reported on the 1824 straw polls, it doesn\u2019t appear that they organized any themselves. As the 19th century progressed, newspapers began conducting their own polls, both as self-promotion and a way of gathering information for readers. Still, these straw polls remained regional, and news publications don\u2019t seem to have framed their polls as electoral predictions.\n\nThis changed in the early 20th century, when The Literary Digest introduced a national presidential poll that gained a reputation for correctly naming the electoral victor.\n\nGeorge Gallup Founds Polling Institute\n\nSTF/AFP via Getty Images Public-opinion statistician George Horace Gallup (center) in a September 1945 photo. In 1935, Gallup founded an institute for public-opinion poll.\n\nIn 1916, The Literary Digest conducted a national straw poll about the presidential election. The poll favored incumbent president Woodrow Wilson, who won reelection later that year. Four years later, the weekly magazine sent out postcards for another national presidential poll. Once again, the winner of The Literary Digest poll\u2014Warren G. Harding\u2014also won the real election.\n\nThe Literary Digest\u2019s predictive streak continued for three more elections, as its polls correctly anticipated the presidential victories of Calvin Coolidge in 1924, Herbert Hoover in 1928 and Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1932. The polls gained the magazine a lot of attention, including from a man named George Gallup.\n\nGallup got his start in public opinion polling while working at an advertising firm. In 1932, he conducted a poll to see if his mother-in-law, Ola Babcock Miller, had a chance of becoming Iowa\u2019s first female secretary of state, and it correctly predicted she\u2019d win. A few years later, he founded the American Institute of Public Opinion, which later became the Gallup organization.\n\nIn 1936, Gallup publicly challenged The Literary Digest\u2019s polling methods in a bid to promote his own. He conducted a presidential survey predicting FDR would win reelection, which clashed with The Literary Digest\u2019s poll predicting Kansas Governor Alf Landon would beat him. The public challenge paid off when FDR won the election in a landslide. The victory helped promote Gallup\u2019s methods while discrediting those of The Literary Digest, which folded a couple of years later.\n\nGallup\u2019s organization continued to conduct polls on public opinion and presidential preferences, running into some issues along the way. One of the most infamous hiccups was in 1948, when Gallup\u2019s company\u2014along with other polling firms\u2014predicted that New York Governor Thomas E. Dewey would beat incumbent president Harry S. Truman.\n\nWith the polls in agreement, the Chicago Daily Tribune felt confident settling on \u201cDewey Defeats Truman\u201d for the early morning headline the day after the election, leading to the famous photo of a victorious Truman holding up the erroneous newspaper headline.\n\nDespite similar \u201csurprise\u201d victories over the years, presidential polls have continued to be a major part of election news, and also become a tool political parties use to test the strength of their own candidates.",

(Brendan Smialowski/Pool/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nHow we did this Pew Research Center conducted this study to understand Americans\u2019 attitudes toward the war in Ukraine. For this analysis, we surveyed 9,424 adults from July 1-7, 2024. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), a group of people recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses who have agreed to take surveys regularly. This kind of recruitment gives nearly all U.S. adults a chance of selection. Surveys were conducted either online or by telephone with a live interviewer. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other factors. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology. Here are the questions used for this report, the topline and the survey methodology.\n\nWith the conflict in Ukraine now in its third year, Republicans and Democrats continue to differ over U.S. policy toward the war-torn country.\n\nA 62% majority of Republicans say the United States does not have a responsibility to help Ukraine defend itself from Russia\u2019s invasion.\n\nAmericans overall are evenly divided on whether the U.S. has a responsibility to help Ukraine (48% say it does, 49% say it does not).\n\nAbout two-thirds of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (63%) say the U.S. has this responsibility.\n\nOnly about a third of Republicans and Republican leaners (36%) say the same.\n\nAmericans remain divided on levels of U.S. aid to Ukraine. Today, 29% of Americans say the U.S. is providing too much support to Ukraine, and a similar share say it\u2019s providing about the right amount (26%). About two-in-ten (19%) say the U.S. is not providing enough support, while a quarter are not sure.\n\nDemocrats largely say the U.S. is providing either the right amount of aid (36%) or not enough assistance (27%). Just 13% say the U.S. is sending too much aid to Ukraine.\n\nNearly half of Republicans (47%) say the U.S. is providing too much aid to Ukraine, more than three times the share of Democrats who say this. Only 18% say current aid levels are about right, while just 12% say the U.S. is providing too little aid.\n\nThe new Pew Research Center survey of 9,424 U.S. adults was conducted July 1-7, 2024 \u2013 before President Joe Biden announced he was dropping his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nRelated: Joe Biden, Public Opinion and His Withdrawal From the 2024 Race\n\nHow much of a threat does the war in Ukraine pose to U.S. interests?\n\nThe share of Americans saying Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine is a threat to U.S. interests has declined significantly since 2022. Today, about a third of the public (34%) says Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine poses a \u201cmajor threat\u201d to U.S. interests. Shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine, half said it was a major threat.\n\nThere is a wide and growing gap between Republicans and Democrats over whether the war in Ukraine is a major threat to U.S. interests.\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans are less likely to say the conflict is a major threat to the U.S. than they were in its early days. But that decline is far sharper among Republicans.\n\n45% of Democrats now say Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine is a major threat, 5 percentage points lower than in March of 2022 but 7 points higher than a year ago.\n\n26% of Republicans say the war is a major threat to the U.S. This share has been essentially flat since early 2023 and remains well below the 51% of Republicans who said this early in the war.\n\nViews of U.S. policies toward Ukraine: Sanctions, military aid, strikes on targets in Russia\n\nA greater share of Americans approve of keeping strict economic sanctions on Russia (69%) than approve of continuing to send military equipment to Ukraine (54%) or allowing Ukraine to use U.S. weapons to strike targets inside Russia (54%).\n\nMajorities of both Republicans (66%) and Democrats (77%) approve of keeping strict economic sanctions on Russia.\n\nMuch smaller shares of Republicans approve of continuing to provide military equipment and weaponry to Ukraine (42%) or allowing Ukraine to use U.S.-made weapons inside Russia\u2019s borders (46%).\n\nMost Democrats approve of continuing to send military aid to Ukraine (71%) and allowing Ukraine to use American-made weapons to strike targets in Russia (65%).\n\nViews of U.S. aid to Ukraine\n\nAmericans continue to be divided over the amount of aid the U.S. is providing to support Ukraine against Russia.\n\nOver the past year and a half, the leading view among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents has been that the U.S. is providing too much support to Ukraine (47% say this currently).\n\nThis balance of opinion among Republicans has not changed much over this period, and it represents a reversal from early in the conflict when fewer than a quarter of Republicans said the U.S. was providing too much aid.\n\nMost Democrats and Democratic leaners have consistently said the U.S. is providing either too little or about the right amount of aid since the war began.\n\nThe share of Democrats who said the U.S. was sending too little aid increased in April, before a new $95 billion aid bill passed Congress. It has now returned to about where it was in late 2023. Only 13% of Democrats say the U.S. is providing too much aid to Ukraine.\n\nAssessments of Ukraine\u2019s military efforts and concerns about the war\n\nAmericans have mixed views of Ukraine\u2019s military effort. Only 11% say Ukraine\u2019s efforts to defend itself are going extremely or very well. More than twice as many (26%) say they are going not too well or not at all well. About four-in-ten (42%) say they\u2019re going somewhat well.\n\nRepublicans are slightly more pessimistic about Ukraine\u2019s defense than Democrats. About a third of Republicans (32%) say Ukraine\u2019s military efforts are not going well, compared with 21% of Democrats.\n\nNearly half of Democrats (47%) say Ukraine\u2019s defense is going somewhat well. About four-in-ten Republicans (39%) say the same.\n\nConcerns over the war in Ukraine\n\nAmericans express a range of concerns arising from the Russia-Ukraine war:\n\n51% say they are extremely or very concerned that the war will continue for many years.\n\nA nearly identical share (50%) are extremely or very concerned that Russia will invade other countries in the region.\n\nSomewhat smaller shares are at least very concerned about Ukraine being defeated by Russia (43% are extremely or very concerned) and U.S. and NATO support for Ukraine leading to a war with Russia (41%).\n\nRelated: NATO Seen Favorably in Member States; Confidence in Zelenskyy Down in Europe, U.S.\n\nDemocrats are significantly more likely than Republicans to say they are highly concerned about Russia invading other countries in Europe and that Ukraine will lose and be taken over.\n\nSix-in-ten Democrats say they are extremely or very concerned that Russia will invade other countries in the region. Roughly four-in-ten Republicans (42%) are as concerned about this.\n\nA majority of Democrats (56%) say they are extremely or very concerned about Ukraine being defeated and taken over by Russia, compared with 33% of Republicans. Democrats\u2019 concerns about Ukraine losing have increased modestly since 2022.\n\nRepublicans (45%) express somewhat higher levels of concern than Democrats (38%) that U.S. and NATO support for Ukraine will lead to a direct war between the U.S. and Russia. Concern among members of both political coalitions is somewhat higher than it was two years ago.",

        "text": "Two of Maine\u2019s congressional races will use ranked-choice voting in November \u2022 Maine Morning Star\nTwo of the three congressional races on Maine ballots in November will use ranked-choice voting, which has impacted the outcome of some recent elections.\n\nLast week, the Department of the Secretary of State released an updated list of general candidates for all races, except for the presidency. The list included an independent candidate running for Maine\u2019s 1st Congressional District, currently held by U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree. It also confirmed there are three candidates running against independent Angus King for his U.S. Senate seat. Because those races have more than two candidates each, they will use ranked-choice voting.\n\nKing is being challenged by Republican Demi Kouzounas, Democrat David Costello and independent Jason Cherry. The former Maine governor easily won his first campaign for the U.S. Senate in 2012 and had little trouble getting reelected in 2018.\n\nJune\u2019s Republican primary for the 1st Congressional District determined Ron Russell would challenge incumbent Pingree, a Democrat. The updated list from the Secretary of State includes a third candidate, Ethan Alcorn, an unenrolled independent from Saco.\n\nAlcorn describes himself as a nonpartisan candidate, \u201cwith very simple and straightforward views to fix straightforward problems.\u201d He added that he\u2019s not left or right, but seeks \u201ccommon sense and practical solutions.\u201d\n\nHaving had multiple careers throughout his life, first as a massage therapist, then as a translator for a nonprofit and then landscaping, Alcorn became more politically involved after the 2016 election by contributing on talk radio stations WLOB and WGAN.\n\nAlcorn tried to run for governor in 2018, but said he lacked the skills at the time to run a successful signature campaign. He tried again in 2022, but was short 600 signatures to get on the ballot, which he said was \u201cdue to time constraints.\u201d Between those runs, Alcorn ran for school board in Saco and lost by 68 votes.\n\nBecause there are only two candidates, Republican Austin Theriault and incumbent Democrat Jared Golden, vying for Maine\u2019s 2nd Congressional District, ranked-choice voting will not be a factor.\n\nRanked-choice voting could potentially be used in the presidential election if independent Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. \u2014 who has to submit 4,000 signatures to the Maine Secretary of State by Thursday \u2014 is on the ballot.\n\nHow it works\n\nUnder ranked-choice voting, voters indicate which candidate is their first choice, second choice, and so on. If no candidate receives more than 50% of the votes on election night, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated and their votes get reassigned to whomever their voters ranked second. This process is repeated until one candidate wins a majority of votes.\n\nRanked-choice voting has twice come into play in Maine\u2019s 2nd Congressional District. Both in 2018 and 2022, Golden beat former U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin after ranked-choice run offs.\n\nMaine was the first state to adopt ranked-choice voting when it did so back in 2016, but it has gained popularity in recent years as more states and municipalities have adopted the practice.",

If the incumbent party is viewed as a failure in six or more of the criteria the challenger is expected to win, according to USA Today.\n\nLichtman said that the eight keys favoring the Democrats in 2024 include no primary challenger for the incumbent; no third-party challenge (with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. not thought to have enough strength to affect the outcome); a strong short-term economy; a strong long-term economy; major policy change from the previous (Trump) administration; no social unrest; no scandal, and an uncharismatic challenger who does not appeal across party lines.\n\nLichtman has used the system to correctly predict the winner of each presidential election from 1984 to 2012, missing out only in 2000, when he predicted Democrat Al Gore would defeat Republican George W. Bush.\n\nLichtman called the 2016 election correctly for Trump even though the keys referred only to the popular vote, which Trump lost. Lichtman correctly predicted Joe Biden\u2019s victory in 2020. The model now predicts the Electoral College winner.\n\nLichtman will make his final call on the race in August, after the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.",

Google won't help you with search results related to the failed July 13 shooting attempt on the former US President. It seems like the tech giant has omitted any mentions of the unsuccessful shooting bid on Trump, leading to accusations that Google is trying to manipulate the 2024 US presidential elections.\n\nWhen users typed \u201cthe assassination attempt of\u201d, it yielded no suggestions related to the July 13 event in Butler, Pennsylvania, which shocked the nation. Following this omission, Donald Trump Jr. and Republicans accused the Sundar Pichai-led tech company of \u201cintentionally\u201d meddling with elections.\n\nIn a post on X (formerly Twitter), Trump Jr. wrote, \u201cBig Tech is trying to interfere in the election AGAIN to help Kamala Harris. We all know this is intentional election interference from Google. Truly despicable.\u201d\n\nFox News reviewed multiple screenshots from users globally and found that Google's search suggestions included various historical events, such as the failed assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan, the killing of Archduke Ferdinand, the shooting of Bob Marley, and the thwarted plot against former President Gerald Ford, instead of the recent incident involving Donald Trump.\n\nA few hours later, billionaire Elon Musk also shared a post on the microblogging site with a screengrab of Google search results, which did not show any suggestions for the former US President when the Tesla CEO typed \u201cPresident Donald.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow, Google has a search ban on President Donald Trump! Election interference?\u201d he captioned the post.\n\nAs the US prepares for the November 2024 presidential election, Kamala Harris has announced her candidacy, with President Joe Biden supporting her to succeed him. On the other hand, Donald Trump is attempting a return to the White House.\n\nThese updates to Google's search tools come amid significant political drama, particularly after Trump claimed on social media he \"took a bullet for democracy\" following his criticism of FBI Director Christopher Wray's testimony.\n\nGoogle responds to Donald Trump Jr's accusations After Texas Congressman and Donald Trump Jr.and his supporters raised the issue, a spokesperson informed The Post that no manual adjustments were made to the search suggestions. Google's spokesperson explained that their systems have safeguards to prevent autocomplete suggestions related to political violence, the report said.\n\nHowever, users noted that this policy didn't seem to apply when searching for assassination attempts on other politicians, such as John F. Kennedy, Abraham Lincoln, Ronald Reagan, and Teddy Roosevelt.\n\nAlso Read | Trump assassination bid: US Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle resigns",

        "text": "News Bureau\nJungHwan Yang, a professor of communication at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, is a co-principal investigator on a research project and a website \u2014 socialpolls.org \u2014 that examine the informal polls about the U.S. presidential election posted on the social media platform X, formerly called Twitter. Yang spoke with News Bureau research editor Sharita Forrest about the project.\n\nSocial media users may be exposed to numerous informal polls during the election. How much faith should they place in the results?\n\nWe examined nearly 2,000 polls posted on X that ostensibly gauged support for U.S. presidential candidates during the 2016 and 2020 elections.\n\nWhile social media polls appear like traditional opinion surveys, they are not accurate measures of public opinion. Instead, they are indicators of political engagement among specific subsets of the population and serve a distinct function.\n\nThis distinction is important because the observed opinions on social media are inherently biased.\n\nWhat are some of ways in which social media polls are biased?\n\nWe found that these polls are biased in terms of their content, authorship and audience.\n\nFirst, they are not scientific. Traditional polls are carefully designed as to who is asked the questions and how the surveys are distributed. Social media polls are purely based on people\u2019s voluntary engagement because they are not asking questions of a representative sample of the electorate.\n\nFor example, if former President Donald Trump is posting a poll, it is very likely that his followers will vote rather than people who do not follow him.\n\nBased on certain events, the level of public engagement also can change drastically. For example, the failed assassination attempt on Trump could mobilize his supporters on a social media platform.\n\nSometimes the survey questions are biased. Creators do not ask the question in an objective way because they want a certain outcome.\n\nBy amplifying some negative aspects of a candidate, they can also skew the responses. For example, they might have asked, \u201cSince Joe Biden\u2019s cognitive health is deteriorating, who do you think the next president of the United States should be?\u201d\n\nAnd the inclusion of a third or fourth candidate in a multiple-choice format can change the results, as can the order of the questions and the responses.\n\nWhat have you found in your research about those who create these polls?\n\nWe scraped data from each poll\u2019s author profile as well as those of their followers. We collected all the profiles of poll authors and their followers who retweeted and tagged each poll as a favorite. Finally, we used machine learning algorithms coupled with human verification to identify these social media users\u2019 demographic and political characteristics.\n\nThe social media polls in the 2016 and 2020 election cycles were predominantly crafted by younger males. That said, polls won by Trump were more likely to be crafted by older users than polls won by Biden/Clinton.\n\nThose who post these social media polls control when they put them on sites and when they close the posts, giving them a lot of control over generating the results they want.\n\nYour study indicates that the creators of these polls purchase votes from bot farms overseas. How prevalent is that? And do social media companies \u2014 some of which claim they block false information \u2014 address it?\n\nIt is common to see social media polls accumulate thousands of votes very quickly.\n\nBot farms and astroturfing campaigns can create fake accounts that follow the instructions of the people who purchase their services. Bad actors who want a certain outcome can buy a lot of votes from bots. As far as we know, social media companies do not monitor these activities and are not transparent about the extent to which this occurs on their platforms.\n\nFalse impressions created by social polls can reduce the quality of political information on social media and further erode trust in these platforms.\n\nHow do these polls affect social media users\u2019 perceptions of the election information reported by mainstream media?\n\nIn a second study we found that some poll questions allude to mistrust in mainstream media. For example, the poll authors might say, \u201cGiven that the traditional media polls are biased, let\u2019s measure the real public opinion with this.\u201d Poll questions hint about conspiracies with voter fraud, rigged elections and follow that kind of narrative.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge the potential impact of these polls in general discussions among the public and in the media. We know that many conservative people in the U.S. have very low trust in mainstream media and information coming from them \u2014 but they trust the social polls they engage with.\n\nFor example, they might think \u201cI voted on an X poll last week, and in that poll, Trump is winning by 75%. But in the poll published in The New York Times, Trump\u2019s winning by only 55% \u2014 so mainstream media are biased.\u201d\n\nIf you consider all the things happening right now in the media, the government, politics and social media, this can be impactful.\n\nWhat is the purpose of the Social Polls website your team created?\n\nThe Social Polls website is a platform to communicate our research findings to the public. We are examining polls conducted over social media to see how the results change daily. We also publish social media poll results after we adjust for bias using sample reweighting methods. And we are constantly updating as we approach the election.\n\nThere is a similar website called fivethirtyeight.com, which was founded by statistician Nate Silver.",

        "text": "Carter Center Statement on Venezuela Election\n(en Espa\u00f1ol)\n\nATLANTA \u2014 Venezuela\u2019s 2024 presidential election did not meet international standards of electoral integrity and cannot be considered democratic.\n\nThe Carter Center cannot verify or corroborate the results of the election declared by the National Electoral Council (CNE), and the electoral authority\u2019s failure to announce disaggregated results by polling station constitutes a serious breach of electoral principles.\n\nVenezuela's electoral process did not meet international standards of electoral integrity at any of its stages and violated numerous provisions of its own national laws. The election took place in an environment of restricted freedoms for political actors, civil society organizations, and the media. Throughout the electoral process, the CNE demonstrated a clear bias in favor of the incumbent.\n\nVoter registration was hurt by short deadlines, relatively few places of registration, and minimal public information. Citizens abroad faced excessive legal requirements to register, some of which appeared to be arbitrary. This effectively disenfranchised most of the migrant population, resulting in very low numbers of voters abroad.\n\nThe registration of parties and candidates also did not meet international standards. Over the past few years, several opposition parties have had their registrations changed to leaders who favor the government. This influenced the nomination of some opposition candidates. Importantly, the registration of the candidacy of the main opposition forces was subject to arbitrary decisions of the CNE, without respecting basic legal principles.\n\nThe electoral campaign was impacted by unequal conditions among candidates. The campaign of the incumbent president was well funded and widely visible through rallies, posters, murals, and street campaigning. The abuse of administrative resources on behalf of the incumbent \u2014 including use of government vehicles, public officials campaigning while in their official capacity, and use of social programs \u2014 was observed throughout the campaign.\n\nThe incumbent also enjoyed overwhelming positive coverage on television and radio, in terms of advertising, broadcast events, and news coverage, while the primary opposition candidate received little media coverage. In addition, authorities frequently attempted to restrict the opposition\u2019s campaign activities. This included harassment or intimidation of people who provided services or goods to the main opposition campaign.\n\nStill, Venezuelan citizens turned out peacefully and in large numbers to express their will on election day. Despite reports of restrictions on access to many polling centers for domestic observers and opposition party witnesses; potential pressure on the voters, such as ruling party checkpoints in the vicinity of voting centers; and incidents of tension or violence reported in some localities; voting appeared to take place in a generally civil manner.\n\nIn the limited number of polling centers they visited, Carter Center observer teams noted the desire of the Venezuelan people to participate in a democratic election process, as demonstrated through their active participation as polling staff, party witnesses, and citizen observers. However, their efforts were undermined by the CNE's complete lack of transparency in announcing the results.\n\nTranslation\n\nDeclaraci\u00f3n del Centro Carter Sobre la Elecci\u00f3n en Venezuela (PDF)\n\n***\n\nAbout the Carter Center technical election observation mission in Venezuela\n\nThe Carter Center was invited by the CNE to observe the presidential election in March 2024 and signed a memorandum of understanding to guarantee that the mission could observe freely in accordance with the Center\u2019s standard methodology. The Carter Center deployed 17 experts and observers starting on June 29, including teams based in Caracas, Barinas, Maracaibo, and Valencia. The mission met with a wide range of stakeholders, including the CNE, candidates, political parties, civil society organizations, citizen observation groups, media representatives, government officials, armed forces, and election experts. Given its limited numbers, the Carter Center\u2019s direct observations were limited, especially on election day.\n\nThe Center has observed 124 elections in 43 nations and is committed to impartial and independent election observation that provides transparency in election processes with the objective of encouraging processes that meet international standards for democratic elections. The Carter Center will publish a final report of its observation mission, documenting the findings indicated in this statement.",

        "text": "How Harris and Trump differ on artificial intelligence policy\nTwo days after President Joe Biden signed a sweeping executive order on artificial intelligence last year, Vice President Kamala Harris brought the wonky document to a global AI summit, telling an international audience what set the U.S. apart in its approach to AI safety.\n\nIn an event meant to address the potential catastrophes posed by futuristic forms of AI, Harris made waves by pivoting to present-day concerns \u2014 and the need to codify protections quickly without stifling innovation.\n\n\"When a senior is kicked off his healthcare plan because of a faulty AI algorithm, is that not existential for him?\" Harris told a crowd in London last November. \"When a woman is threatened by an abusive partner with explicit deepfake photographs, is that not existential for her?\"\n\nNow, she's running for president and her chief opponent, former President Donald Trump, has said he wants to \"cancel\" the Biden order. Trump's running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, also brings his own views on AI, which are influenced by his ties to some Silicon Valley figures pushing to limit AI regulation.\n\nAI's growing visibility in everyday life has made it a popular discussion topic but hasn't yet elevated it to a top concern for American voters. But this could be the first presidential election where the candidates are crafting competing visions on how to guide American leadership over the fast-developing technology.\n\nHere are the candidates' records on AI:\n\nTrump's approach\n\nBiden signed his AI executive order last Oct. 30, and soon after Trump was signaling on the campaign trail that, if re-elected, he'd do away with it. His pledge was memorialized in the platform of this month's Republican National Convention.\n\n\"We will repeal Joe Biden's dangerous Executive Order that hinders AI Innovation, and imposes Radical Leftwing ideas on the development of this technology,\" says Trump's platform. \"In its place, Republicans support AI Development rooted in Free Speech and Human Flourishing.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign didn't respond to a requests for more details.\n\nTrump didn't spend much time talking about AI during his four years as president, though in 2019 he became the first to sign an executive order about AI. It directed federal agencies to prioritize research and development in the field.\n\nBefore that, tech experts were pushing the Trump-era White House for a stronger AI strategy to match what other countries were pursuing. In 2017, not long before Google quietly introduced a research breakthrough helping to set the foundation of the technology now known as generative AI, then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin brushed aside concerns about AI displacing jobs, saying that prospect was so far in the future that \"it's not even on my radar screen.\"\n\nThat perspective later shifted, with Trump's top tech adviser telling corporate leaders in 2018 that AI-fueled job displacement is \"inevitable\" and that \"we can't sit idle, hoping eventually the market will sort it out.\" The 2019 order called on federal agencies to \"protect civil liberties, privacy and American values\" in applying AI technologies, and to help workers gain relevant skills.\n\nTrump also in the waning weeks of his administration signed an executive order promoting the use of \"trustworthy\" AI in the federal government. Those policies carried over into the Biden administration.\n\nHarris' approach\n\nThe debut of ChatGPT nearly halfway through Biden's presidential term made it impossible for politicians to ignore AI. Within months, Harris was convening the heads of Google, Microsoft and other tech companies at the White House, a first step down a path that brought leading developers to agree to voluntary commitments to ensure their technology won't put people's rights and safety at risk.\n\nThen came Biden's AI order, which used Korean War-era national security powers to scrutinize high-risk commercial AI systems but was mostly directed at safeguarding the government's use of the technology and setting standards that could foster commercial adoption. Unlike the European Union, however, the U.S. still has no broad rules on AI \u2014 something that would require Congress to pass.\n\nHarris already brought to the White House a deep understanding of Silicon Valley, having grown up and worked in the San Francisco Bay Area and later served as California's attorney general, where she forged relationships with some tech leaders, said Alondra Nelson, former director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.\n\nEven before ChatGPT, Nelson led the White House efforts to draft a blueprint for an AI \"bill of rights\" to guard against the technology's potential harms. But it was the speech at the Global Summit on AI Safety in London where Harris brought all those threads together and \"articulated to the world what American AI strategy was,\" Nelson said.\n\nHarris said she and Biden \"reject the false choice that suggests we can either protect the public or advance innovation.\" And while acknowledging a need to consider existential threats to humanity, Harris emphasized \"the full spectrum of AI risk.\"\n\n\"She kind of opened the aperture of the conversation about potential AI risks and harms,\" Nelson said.\n\nVance and the VCs\n\nTrump's pick of the former venture capitalist Vance as running mate added a new element to the differences between the campaigns. So did Trump's newfound endorsements from a group of AI-focused tech leaders including Elon Musk and the venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz.\n\nVance has acknowledged some harmful AI applications, but said at a July Senate hearing that he worries that concern is justifying \"some preemptive overregulation attempts that would frankly entrench the tech incumbents that we already have.\"\n\nAndreessen, who sits on the board of Meta Platforms, has criticized a provision of Biden's order that requires government scrutiny of the most powerful and ostensibly risky AI systems if they can perform a certain number of mathematical calculations per second.\n\nOn a podcast with business partner Horowitz explaining their support of Trump, Andreessen said he was concerned with \"the idea that we're going to deliberately hamstring ourselves through onerous regulations while the rest of the world lights up on this, and while China lights up on this.\"\n\nHorowitz read aloud the RNC call to repeal Biden's order, saying \"that sounds like a good plan to me\" and noting that he and Andreessen had discussed the proposals with Trump at a dinner.\n\nTrump met with another group of VCs in a video podcast in June, sharing their view that AI leadership will require huge amounts of electricity \u2014 a perspective he shared again on the RNC stage where he said it will require \"twice the electricity that's available now in our country.\" It was his sole mention of AI in the 92-minute speech.\n\nAre they that different on AI?\n\nMuch is still unknown, including to what extent either Harris or the Trump-Vance ticket will heed the opinions of their competing wings of Silicon Valley support.\n\nWhile the rhetorical differences are sharpening, \"there's a lot of similarity\" between how the Trump and Biden administrations approached AI policy, said Aaron Cooper, senior vice president of global policy for BSA The Software Alliance, which advocates for software companies including Microsoft.\n\nVoters haven't yet heard much detail about how a Harris or second Trump administration would change that.\n\n\"What we'll continue to see as the technology develops and as new issues arise, regardless of who's in the White House, they'll be looking at how we can unleash the most good from AI while reducing the most harm,\" Cooper said. \"That sounds obvious, but it's not an easy calculation.\"",

        "text": "Who could Kamala Harris pick as her vice-presidential candidate?\nWho could be Kamala Harris's running mate?\n\nGetty Images Josh Shapiro, Tim Walz and Mark Kelly\n\nNow that Vice-President Kamala Harris is closing in on the Democratic nomination to take on Republican Donald Trump, talk has turned to her running mate. She will need to pick one by the time Democratic party delegates vote next month at a convention in Chicago to officially confirm who is on the ticket. A team to vet the people in the frame has been reportedly appointed to explore who might best stand up to the scrutiny of the national spotlight. Historically, vice-presidents are picked to complement a candidate and strategists believe for that reason she may pick a white man from a battleground state. Here's a bit on the names reported to be in the mix, with an assessment of their chances by North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher.\n\nJosh Shapiro, Pennsylvania governor\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe charismatic governor of Pennsylvania, a state that many think is essentially must-win for Harris, has oratory skills which have drawn comparisons with Barack Obama. He would be the first Jewish vice-president and has peeled off Republican voters in his home state. Shapiro has seen high approval ratings since he was elected in 2022 in a swing state Trump narrowly carried in 2016. He made national headlines last year after quickly rebuilding a collapsed bridge on a crucial Philadelphia highway - a major political victory for a first-term governor. The speedy repair was hailed by many as the perfect infrastructure talking point for a potential 2028 presidential candidate. Anthony Zurcher: He could help lock down an important - perhaps the most important - state for Ms Harris. But his outspoken support of Israel during the Gaza War and his criticism of student protests in his state might open up divisions within the Democratic Party that the vice-president is keen to avoid.\n\nTim Walz, Minnesota governor\n\nReuters\n\nThe 60-year-old served 12 years as a US congressman before his successful 2018 run to lead the state. His performance as governor was thrust into the national spotlight when he sent in the National Guard to deal with mass protests after the death of George Floyd. He himself had a 20-year service in the National Guard before his political career, a time when he also taught at a high school and worked as an assistant football coach. When asked whether he would serve as Ms Harris' running mate, Mr Walz told CNN's State of the Union: \u201cI would do what is in the best interest of the country.\" He dodged the question when asked if he received vetting materials. AZ: Minnesota may not be a top-line battleground state, but Tim Walz has the small-town Midwestern sensibilities to give him some cross-border appeal. While he governs from the left, his plainspoken manner and religious convictions give him a moderate sheen.\n\nMark Kelly, Arizona senator\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe former astronaut and Navy combat pilot has an all-action edge, while his strong border stance and occasional criticisms of the Biden administration could be eye-catching for floating conservative voters. His Democratic superstar wife Gabby Giffords, who was shot in a mass shooting, gives him a personal story as strong as his CV. The former House congresswoman was seriously wounded and has become one of the leading voices on gun safety laws. With gun violence a major campaign issue for Democrats, Mr Kelly\u2019s personal story could resonate with voters. AZ: Mark Kelly is from a state that Democrats would love to keep in their column. His selection would create challenges down the road, however, as Democrats would have to gear up for another pivotal Senate campaign to hold his seat in a special election in 2026.\n\nAndy Beshear, Kentucky governor\n\nGetty Images\n\nMr Beshear has carved out a successful career as the Democratic leader of a deep-red state, which voted for Trump by a margin of more than 25 percentage points in 2020. That year he became the only Democratic governor to win in a Trump state, helped by the state's booming pre-Covid economy. Supporting public education and protecting reproductive rights are also key issues for him. Kamala Harris and he have been close for a long time so there would be no question marks about chemistry if picked as her running mate. The most youthful of those in the frame can help Harris underline the generation gap with the top of the Republican ticket. And he\u2019s not afraid of talking about his Christian faith and its impact on his personality and work, something that might endear him to parts of America beyond Harris\u2019s reach. Mr Beshear dodged reporters' questions in Georgia when asked if he was being vetted to serve as Harris' running mate. AZ: Andy Beshear has proven himself adept at winning support in a state that is dominated by Republicans and voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump in 2020. He\u2019s the son of a popular former Kentucky governor, though, which gave him electoral advantages he might not be able to reproduce nationally.\n\nJB Pritzker, Illinois governor\n\nGetty Images\n\nJB Pritzker, the governor of Illinois, has raised his profile in recent years by going after Trump and defending Mr Biden. The billionaire businessman - heir to the Hyatt hotel chain - is quick to post criticism of Trump on social media. After the debate he called Trump a \"liar\" and said he is a \"34-count convicted felon who cares only about himself\". Like Ms Whitmer, Mr Pritzker has a track record of completing agenda items on left-wing Democrats' to-do lists on issues like abortion rights and gun control. He also dodged questions on ABC about whether he was being vetted to serve as the vice-presidential candidate. AZ: He has a blunt Chicago manner that lends an air of everyman authenticity to his politics. Coming from deeply Democratic Illinois, however, may limit his appeal in the mid-western swing states - particularly given Ms Harris\u2019s liberal California background.\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg\n\nGetty Images\n\nIt is no secret that Pete Buttigieg has presidential aspirations. He ran in 2020 and is often touted as one of the Biden administration's best communicators. Mr Buttigieg has managed a number of public crises during his time as transportation secretary. He helped to oversee the government response to the East Palestine train derailment in Ohio, the Baltimore Bridge collapse and Southwest Airlines' scheduling crisis in 2022. Mr Buttigieg stated on X, formerly Twitter, that Mr Biden had \"earned his place among the best and most consequential presidents in American history\". He said he would do \"all that I can to help elect Kamala Harris the next President\". AZ: Pete Buttigieg was the surprise hit of the 2020 Democratic presidential race, generating a loyal following that is still with him. His ability to adeptly define and defend the party\u2019s priorities, even in hostile territory like Fox News, could be a useful skill for a running mate.\n\nOther possible candidates?",

        "text": "Could Palestine decide the US presidential election?\nIt has been a dramatic half a month for US politics with a dizzying string of rapid-fire events. Republican candidate and former president, Donald Trump, survived an assassination attempt and emerged bolder and more energised in rallying his base. President Joe Biden withdrew from the presidential race, endorsing his vice president, Kamala Harris, who within a week managed to win enough delegate support to secure the nomination at the upcoming Democratic National Convention set for August 19-22.\n\nHarris has re-invigorated the Democratic campaign, raising more than $200m in donations, getting 100,000 new voters to register, and securing 170,000 new volunteers within just seven days.\n\nShe is also doing better at the polls. Her \u201cfavourability\u201d score with the American public rose 8 percentage points to 43 percent in one week. Among likely voters, she is currently polling at 47 percent, just one percentage point behind Trump.\n\nSome of Harris\u2019s early success may be attributed to the significant relief many Democrats certainly felt over Biden\u2019s decision to step aside. A whopping 87 percent of registered Democrats supported his withdrawal.\n\nBut this early momentum is unlikely to hold all the way to the election in early November. And while Harris brought much-needed change to the Democratic campaign, she also represents continuity with the Biden administration, which on certain issues could put her at a disadvantage.\n\nOne of these issues is the Israeli genocide in Gaza. Let us remember that one reason Biden was initially seen to be vulnerable was the Arab and Muslim American-led \u201cuncommitted vote\u201d campaign during the Democratic primaries earlier this year. A significant percentage of Democrats voted uncommitted to signal their rejection of Biden\u2019s unconditional support for Israel\u2019s Gaza genocide.\n\nThe results in key swing states particularly worried the Biden campaign. In Michigan and Wisconsin, for example, 101,000 and 47,800, respectively, voted uncommitted. Biden had won both states by margins as small as 154,000 and 20,600 in 2020.\n\nIn the latest polls, Harris is trailing Trump by 2 to 10 percent in swing states like Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania; in Michigan, she is one percentage point behind and in Wisconsin they both poll at 47 percent. In other words, the Arab and Muslim American communities, supported by their many progressive allies, could play a defining role in determining small-margin wins in these states. They may prove key for her victory, if she lags behind Trump in other swing states like Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina or Georgia.\n\nMembers of the \u201cAbandon Biden\u201d and \u201cuncommitted\u201d movements have threatened to abandon Harris if she continues Biden\u2019s pro-war policy. The \u201cuncommitted\u201d movement has expanded into a growing coalition that includes other traditional Democratic Party voters, like labour activists, progressive Jews, Black people and Hispanics, and others who support social justice issues. On July 23, for example, seven labour unions representing millions of American workers asked Biden in a joint letter to halt military aid to Israel.\n\nIt is important to point out that opposition to the Biden administration\u2019s policies on Palestine and Israel goes beyond these interest groups. Americans\u2019 backing for Israel\u2019s war is currently at 42 percent; among Democrats it stands at 23 percent. In other words, the vast majority of Harris\u2019s Democratic base does not support Israel\u2019s actions, which the Biden administration has wholeheartedly endorsed.\n\nI asked Huwaida Arraf, a Palestinian-American Michigan-based lawyer, human rights activist, and an \u201cuncommitted\u201d alternate delegate to the Democratic National Convention, whether and how her colleagues expect Harris to respond to their demands. She replied: \u201cTo get our votes, the Democratic Party must fundamentally change course on Gaza specifically, and on Palestine in general. It cannot keep mistreating us, enabling and funding a genocide of our people, then expecting our votes by warning us that the alternative will be worse. Harris is part of an administration that is complicit in genocide and has done nothing to stop it. While she is seen as slightly better than Biden, this is a very low bar, and will not be enough to get our votes. To have a chance, Harris must distance herself from Biden\u2019s policies in a clear and tangible way that goes beyond words. We will no longer accept crumbs.\u201d\n\nThis sentiment is widespread among uncommitted members, who have closely followed Harris\u2019s statements on Gaza. The vice president did not attend Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s congressional address on July 24, but she did meet him the following day.\n\nHer comments after their meeting offered possible hints about her position on Gaza. She called for a ceasefire, a two-state solution, and a stop to the mass suffering of Palestinian civilians, referring to Palestinian women and children in a humanised way that is rarely heard in Washington.\n\nSeasoned Middle East analyst and justice advocate Adam Shapiro, a Brooklyn native currently based in Michigan, told me, \u201cHarris has to be aware the Israeli genocide in Gaza caused the drop in support for Biden, and we have to see if she does anything about that. Her contrast with Biden is often striking in her style and words, but she has spoken well of reducing Palestinian suffering while also supporting the Biden war policy. Skipping the Netanyahu speech is more impressive than her words of concern. Now she must show if she can change her position by the time of the November election in a meaningful way.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic National Convention may give Harris the platform to make clear her position on Israel and its war on Gaza. As the Democratic presidential candidate, she would have more influence than she does now as vice president. To what extent she is willing to distance herself from Biden\u2019s staunch support for Israel\u2019s war may determine how much backing she gains from pro-Palestinian progressive Democrats.\n\n\u201cThe bare minimum [Harris must do] is to declare support for an arms embargo on Israel before the November vote,\u201d Arraf said. A Harris commitment to respecting international law is another area activists are watching, including a commitment to applying relevant US laws on arms transfers that are used in genocide or other human rights abuses. Others say that there can be changes in the party platform overall, announced at the convention in August.\n\nThe 2024 presidential election was always expected to be one of the most consequential presidential votes in modern American history, given the expanding powers of the far right and the fears of Democrats who fret for their democracy. This is now shaping up as an even more historic event not only because it could put a woman of colour in charge of the White House for the first time in US history, but also because it could produce a significant shift in the Democratic Party\u2019s position on Israel-Palestine.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author\u2019s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera\u2019s editorial stance.",

        "text": "Trump says he \u2018probably\u2019 will debate Harris but can \u2018make a case for not.\u2019 Her team says he\u2019s scared\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump seems to be backing away from his earlier commitment to debate Vice President Kamala Harris, questioning the value of a meetup and saying he \u201cprobably\u201d will debate but he \u201ccan also make a case for not doing it\u201d \u2014 prompting her campaign to say he\u2019s \u201cscared.\u201d\n\nTrump, in an interview with Fox News Channel that aired Monday night, was pressed several times about committing to debating Harris before giving a squishier answer than he had in recent days.\n\nThe Republican former president had been willing to debate President Joe Biden when Biden was the Democratic nominee after months of suggesting that the president was not mentally up for the matchup \u2014 or the presidency. But after Biden dropped out of the race and Harris became poised to be the Democratic presidential candidate, Trump has been questioning the terms of the original debate he agreed to with Biden. He has suggested the Sept. 10 debate on ABC News should be moved to a different network, calling ABC \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\nLast week, in a phone call with reporters, Trump was asked if he\u2019d commit to debating Harris at least once. He responded: \u201cOh, yes, absolutely. I\u2019d want to,\u201d and he said there was an obligation to debate.\n\nIn the interview Monday, host Laura Ingraham repeatedly pressed Trump on whether he would commit to a debate.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\n\u201cI want to do a debate. But I also can say this. Everybody knows who I am. And now people know who she is,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump eventually said, \u201cThe answer is yes, I\u2019ll probably end up debating.\u201d\n\nHe went on for a minute, saying any debates need to be held before early voting starts in states, and then he added, \u201cThe answer is yes, but I can also make a case for not doing it.\u201d\n\nTrump has skipped debates before, including all the 2024 Republican presidential primary debates. He initially didn\u2019t participate after suggesting the timing was too early and then questioning the venue of another before eventually making it clear he would not participate in any of those debates.\n\nHarris campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa accused Trump of continuing to dodge a face-off with his likely opponent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear from tonight\u2019s question-dodging: He\u2019s scared he\u2019ll have to defend his running mate\u2019s weird attacks on women or his own calls to end elections in America in a debate against the vice president,\u201d Moussa said.\n\nThe Republican candidate also sought in the interview Monday to clarify comments he made last week at a conservative event in which he told an audience of Christians that they \u201cwon\u2019t have to vote anymore\u201d after he\u2019s elected.\n\nHe urged Christians, who he claims don\u2019t vote in high numbers, to vote \u201cjust this time,\u201d and said, \u201cYou won\u2019t have to do it anymore.\u201d\n\nIn four years, he said: \u201cIt\u2019ll be fixed, it\u2019ll be fine. You won\u2019t have to vote anymore, my beautiful Christians.\u201d\n\nHe added moments later: \u201cIn four years, you don\u2019t have to vote again. We\u2019ll have it fixed so good, you\u2019re not gonna have to vote.\u201d\n\nThe comments drew alarm from Democrats and others who noted Trump\u2019s pattern of using authoritarian language, his earlier comments that he would only be a dictator on \u201cday one\u201d and his behavior after losing the 2020 presidential election, in which he refused to accept the results and sought to overturn them.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign and supporters offered various explanations for his comments, and Ingraham prodded him to explain what he meant.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t vote, and I\u2019m explaining that to \u2018em. \u2018You never vote.\u2019 This time, vote. I\u2019ll straighten out the country. You won\u2019t have to vote anymore. I won\u2019t need your vote,\u201d Trump said.\n\nIngraham asked if he meant Christians won\u2019t need to vote for him because he will only have four years in office.\n\nTrump started his answer by speaking about voting rates of Christians and gun owners, and Ingraham interrupted to ask him again.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about the future. Vote, on, you have to vote on November 5th. After that, you don\u2019t have to worry about voting anymore. I don\u2019t care because we\u2019re going to fix up \u2014 the country will be fixed and we won\u2019t even need your vote anymore because, frankly, we will have such love. If you don\u2019t want to vote anymore, that\u2019s OK,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump made similar comments last month at another Christian-focused event, in which he lamented the voting rates of Christians and implored them to participate in the election.\n\n\u201cIn four years, you don\u2019t have to vote, OK? In four years, don\u2019t vote.

        "text": "July 30, 2024, presidential campaign news\nFar from the boring rematch that had many Americans tuning out politics, the 2024 presidential election has had wild twists and scary turns.\n\nNobody expected President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign to implode in less than a month, from the shock of his performance at CNN\u2019s debate in late June to his decision to step aside in the race in late July. Democrats went from literally freaking out about his candidacy to a new excitement about Vice President Kamala Harris as his replacement.\n\nNobody expected an assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump, an event that unified Republicans around him and has many in his party showing a sort of divine reverence for his near-death experience.\n\nSo we don\u2019t know specifically what will happen in the sprint to Election Day on November 5, or what could come after, when the country\u2019s unique Electoral College process gets going. But we do have some idea of what to expect:\n\nAugust: Nominating Harris, picking a VP and a convention in Chicago: While the Democratic Party almost immediately rallied around Harris as its nominee, it still needs to officially select her. Delegates will do that in short order, between August 1 and August 7, before the convention, a backstop maneuver to ward against ballot changes.\n\nHarris will also need to pick a running mate. Look for that to occur soon, according to CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny, and not right before the convention, as frequently occurs.\n\nIn late August, Democrats will convene in Chicago for their convention. Expect the most incredible reception for Biden. Democrats have pivoted from worrying over his election prospects to lionizing him as a hero.\n\nEarlier in the month, Sen. JD Vance, Trump\u2019s running mate, turns 40. He\u2019d be the third-youngest vice president in US history and the first millennial in nationwide elected office if the Republican ticket wins. With Biden out of the race, Vance is on the ticket with the oldest major-party nominee in history with Trump, a baby boomer.\n\nRead more about what to expect with the presidential election less than 100 days away.",

        "text": "Polling expert draws early conclusions from Harris vs. Trump\nA couple weeks back, the 2024 presidential race was upended by the decision of President Joe Biden not to seek reelection. Since then, political pundits have scrambled to assess the new Harris-Trump dynamic. The dust is settling on a flurry of polls, and we asked UCR polling and survey expert Andy Crosby, an assistant professor in the School of Public Policy, to weigh in on trends. He approached his assessment below from the perspectives of Harris\u2019 introduction to the race; the effect of JD Vance as the GOP\u2019s vice presidential choice, and the importance of considering trends not in the popular vote, but in the electoral college vote.\n\nThe Introduction of VP Harris\n\nOne of the largest stories in polling has been President Biden announcing he would not continue his bid for re-election and his endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris as his replacement on the Democratic ticket.\n\nOverall, the race remains close. A recent New York Times/Siena College poll conducted July 22-24 shows that Donald Trump has a slight lead over Vice President Kamala Harris, with 48% of respondents indicating they would vote for Trump if the election were held today, compared to 47% of respondents that indicated they would vote for Harris. These results are within the poll\u2019s margin of error of 3.3%.\n\nAndy Crosby\n\nOne of the changes we have seen is an increase in Vice President Harris\u2019 favorability in the polls recently. In an ABC News/Ipsos poll released on Sunday, 43% of respondents reported having a favorable view of Harris, compared to just 35% one week ago. Harris\u2019 favorability rating is also now higher than both President Joe Biden (37%) and former President Donald Trump (36%). A large majority of Democrats are also enthusiastic about Harris\u2019 candidacy: 88% of respondents reported being either \u201cvery enthusiastic\u201d or \u201csomewhat enthusiastic\u201d about Harris\u2019 candidacy.\n\nAlthough Vice President Harris is almost certain to be the Democratic nominee, keep in mind that she has only been campaigning for just over one week, and we may see some movement in the polls over the coming weeks as voters get to know her more and we potentially see a presidential debate. In addition, Vice President Harris will also soon announce her running mate, and her running mate may also have something of an effect on polls, particularly in certain states that are the home state of a potential running mate (more on that below).\n\nThe Introduction of Sen. JD Vance\n\nIn addition to Vice President Harris, we also have another newcomer to our political polling for the presidential election: Republican vice-presidential candidate Senator JD Vance of Ohio. The New York Times/Siena College poll mentioned above shows slightly more respondents viewing Vance unfavorably than favorably (36% favorable, 40% unfavorable). In the ABC News/Ipsos poll mentioned above, which is slightly more recent, 24% of respondents indicated they had a favorable opinion of Vance, and 39% indicated they had an unfavorable opinion. Notably, a considerable portion of respondents in the ABC News/Ispos poll responded that they either had no opinion of Vance (17%) or they did not know (19%). Like Harris, we may see movement in these results as voters get to know Vance more and we may potentially see a televised debate featuring him and the Democratic vice-presidential nominee.\n\nThe States, the States, the States\n\nYou might be wondering: what should someone make of all of this recent polling data? A well-known saying from the late Tim Russert in the 2000 Presidential Election was \u201cFlorida, Florida, Florida,\u201d written on a small board in marker and referring to the fact that the presidential election that year would come down to the votes in just one state. If there is one single thing that I would emphasize 100 days out until the November election, it is the importance of watching polling in individual states. Although national polls are interesting to watch and may inform us of how the country overall is feeling, we also need to keep in mind that we do not elect presidents on a national basis in the United States. Instead, we use the Electoral College. Because of this, watching individual state polls \u2013 particularly battleground states such as Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin \u2013 may be more useful to predict the election than national polls. We are just starting to see Vice President Harris included in these state polls.\n\nThe importance of battleground states is also one reason that Vice President Harris may select a running mate who is popular in a battleground state, such as Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona or Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania. Although these potential vice-presidential candidates do not register large percentages of either favorable or unfavorable views at this point in the race, this is mostly because they are not as well-known outside of their home states. That will likely change once voters get to know the candidate.\n\nWith less than 100 days to go, keep your eyes on the states!",

While the current administration has prioritized scrutinizing M&A deal, we could see a different approach from a new administration.\n\nThe potential impacts of the U.S. election on M&A are further explored in an article from the Q3 Torys Quarterly titled \u201cU.S. M&A outlook and the 2024 election\u201d. \u201cCommon wisdom among dealmakers is that U.S. presidential elections have more of an effect on deal timing than deal outcomes,\u201d the article says. For example, the volume of deals in the third quarter of presidential election years are typically lower than in non-election years; however, in the first quarter following the election, deals tend to \u201cspike by approximately the same amount that they were depressed prior to the election.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis \u2018dip and recovery\u2019 pattern suggests that some deals are delayed to allow parties to adjust deals for election outcomes\u2014but that most ultimately go through in some form, regardless of the election outcome,\u201d the article explains.\n\nLearn more about our M&A work on our practice page.",

NPR's Steve Inskeep asks economist Francisco Rodriguez if and how the U.S. should respond.\n\nLEILA FADEL, HOST:\n\nThe opposition leader in Venezuela, Edmundo Gonzalez - he ran against longtime President Nicolas Maduro - says his campaign now has proof that he won Sunday's presidential election. Thousands of protesters took to the streets across the country in protest of Maduro's continued rule, and global leaders are expressing skepticism and concern after the country's electoral authority declared Maduro the president. Again, here's U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nANTONY BLINKEN: It's critical that every vote be counted fairly and transparently, that election officials immediately share information with the opposition and independent observers without delay. And that the electoral authorities publish the detailed tabulation of votes. The international community is watching this very closely and will respond accordingly.\n\nFADEL: Some countries, including the U.S., have held off recognizing the results. For a sense of the global implications of this election and claims of fraud in Venezuela, including its impact on the U.S., we're joined now by Francisco Rodriguez. He's a Venezuelan economist and professor at the University of Denver. Good morning. Thanks for being on the program.\n\nFRANCISCO RODRIGUEZ: Good morning.\n\nFADEL: So let's start with the legitimacy of the election. There wasn't violence. Voters voted on electronic voting machines. Is it clear there was fraud here?\n\nRODRIGUEZ: Well, it's apparent that there was fraud. Right now, what we have are essentially two sets of results. There are results that have been announced by the government...\n\nFADEL: Yeah.\n\nRODRIGUEZ: ...And by the electoral council, which is controlled by the government. Those put Maduro ahead. And we have the opposition now releasing its own results that say that it won by a massive margin, by a two-to-one margin. The opposition has started uploading the detailed results by voting center and allowing people to verify the results in their voting center. The government has not published disaggregated results. The government has simply published an aggregate number. The electoral council website is down. So there's definitely very serious indication that there's something going on here with the results, and that the results may have been altered, but this really merits an independent investigation, and it merits a very close look at these results with the disaggregated poll results that the electoral authorities have yet to publish.\n\nFADEL: Now, Venezuela has one of the world's largest oil reserves in the world. And under Maduro's rule, the economy has suffered, oil prices dropped, hyperinflation. Millions of Venezuelans have left. But I want to ask you why this election matters so much to the world, and particularly to the U.S. And why does it matter?\n\nRODRIGUEZ: Well, Venezuela has been isolated from the world economy since the U.S. imposed sanctions in 2019. So let's remember that Maduro's previous reelection was also seen as illegitimate, and Venezuela's oil production has plummeted and even though the country has the world's largest oil resource by some accounts, it's producing less than 1 million barrels a day. So it's definitely important for Venezuela to have a transition to a democratic system with an internationally recognized government, not just for and primarily, so that Venezuelans can express themselves and have a government of their own choosing, but also to reinsert Venezuela into the world economy, to be able to recover the economy from the huge collapse Venezuela's GDP per capital has suffered. It's declined by more than 71%. That's the equivalent of three Great Depressions. And it's the largest economic contraction ever seen outside of wartime. And also because the country has seen a mass exodus of more than a quarter of its population, and that has meant millions of Venezuelans living in Colombia and Peru and trying to come into the U.S. It's fueling the U.S. migrant crisis. So there's definitely spillover effects into the region, into the world, into the U.S.\n\nFADEL: You mentioned the number of people coming into the U.S. The U.S. has taken extreme interest in Maduro's rule. It's imposed sanctions in the past. Maduro insists he won this election. What will the U.S. do now?\n\nRODRIGUEZ: Well, the U.S. doesn't have actually that many libers because it's already significantly sanctioned Venezuela. Now, the U.S. did start lifting and easing some of those sanctions two years ago in order to get Venezuela reinserted into global markets. And also, as a result of negotiations with the Venezuelan government, that were supposed to lead to free and fair elections. Now, the U.S. can roll back some of these sanctions - I mean, reimpose some of the sanctions, roll back some of the sanctions relief, but that's something that has to be done very carefully because the economic sanctions imposed in Venezuela have also contributed to the country's economic crisis. So here, if the US reimposes sanctions and tries to block off Venezuela and oil exports again, it could simply contribute to a deepening of the country's crisis and to an increase in migrant influxes.\n\nFADEL: That's Francisco Rodriguez. He's a Venezuelan economist and professor at the University of Denver. Thank you so much for your time.\n\nRODRIGUEZ: Thank you.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 NPR. All rights reserved.

        "text": "US officials voice \"serious concerns\" over contested outcome of Venezuela election\nFollowing an election clouded by irregularities, the Biden administration on Monday called on Venezuela's electoral authority to release detailed polling data to support its claim that the country's autocratic leader Nicolas Maduro has secured a third six-year term -- a contested outcome that could have significant ramifications for the region and fuel debate over immigration in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election.\n\n\"We have serious concerns that the result announced does not reflect the will or the votes of the Venezuelan people,\" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during a news conference in Tokyo.\n\n\"It's critical that every vote be counted fairly and transparently that election officials immediately share information with the opposition and independent observers without delay,\" he continued.\n\nDespite challenges from Maduro's political opposition and unanswered questions from South American officials acting as impartial observers, Venezuela's electoral council, which is aligned with Maduro's regime, formalized the results of the vote, effectively handing the ruler another six-year term.\n\nVenezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado talks to the media next to opposition presidential candidate Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, following the presidential election results in Caracas on July 29, 2024. Federico Parra/AFP via Getty Images\n\nMaduro has responded with defiance.\n\n\"We have always been victims of the powerful,\" Maduro asserted during a nationally televised ceremony on Monday. \"An attempt is being made to impose a coup d'\u00e9tat in Venezuela again of a fascist and counterrevolutionary nature.\"\n\nMar\u00eda Corina Machado, the opposition popular leader, asserted that, despite Maduro's claims, her party's candidate had won an \"overwhelming\" victory and that the reported polling results were \"impossible.\"\n\nVenezuelan President Nicolas Maduro holds up his certification from the National Electoral Council (CNE) that declares him the winner of the presidential election, at the CNE in Caracas, Venezuela, July 29, 2024. Matias Delacroix/AP\n\nIn the weeks preceding the election, the prospect of Maduro clinging to power has stoked fears of increased economic turmoil and political violence that experts say could spark another exodus from the country.\n\nAlmost 8 million Venezuelans -- roughly a quarter of the country's population -- have left the country over the last decade, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency.\n\nThat diaspora has exacerbated irregular migration to the U.S. In 2023, border patrol agents encountered Venezuelan migrants attempting to enter through the southern border nearly 335,000 times, data from the Department of Homeland Security shows.\n\nThe Biden administration has attempted to curb the number of crossings through multiple initiatives, including by introducing a new policy allowing Venezuelans to apply for entry to the U.S. from abroad, resuming deportations of Venezuelan migrants, and even using diplomatic leverage to push Maduro to hold the country's most recent election.\n\nDespite the changes and modest improvements to Venezuela\u2019s economy, data shows that the number of the country\u2019s nationals crossing between checkpoints on the U.S.-Mexico border has remained elevated. Polling conducted by a Venezuelan-based research firm earlier this year found that roughly a quarter of the country\u2019s current population was considering emigrating if Maduro won the election.\n\nProtesters demonstrate against the official election results declaring President Nicolas Maduro the winner, the day after the presidential election in Caracas, Venezuela, July 29, 2024. Matias Delacroix/AP\n\nSenior Biden administration officials defended their handling of Maduro's government, including using economic incentives to entice Maduro to take steps aimed at moving the country towards democracy.\n\n\"That Venezuela did, in fact, hold an election yesterday, which allowed an opposition candidate to be on the ballot and for a voting process to unfold only came about as a result of the calibrations that we've done with our sanctions policy over the last year,\" one official said.\n\nThe driving factors behind Venezuela's immigration crisis are also complicated. A high-ranking State Department official who served under President Donald Trump told the Washington Post he warned the former administration that imposing hardline sanctions would \"grind the Venezuelan economy into dust & have huge human consequences, one of which would be out-migration.\"\n\nOpponents of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's government bang pots and pans during a protest at the El Valle neighborhood in Caracas on July 29, 2024, a day after the Venezuelan presidential election. Federico Parra/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe Biden administration has largely kept Trump's economic penalties on Venezuela in place, but it has made some notable carveout, including granting authorizations to select companies permitting them to operate in the country's lucrative oil sector.\n\nIn the wake of Maduro's handling of the election, officials indicated that they would not revoke existing sanctions but that they would rethink their approach to Venezuela based on whether the government increases transparency surrounding the election.\n\n\"We're watching. The world watching. I won't get ahead of a decision hasn't been made here in terms of consequences. We're going to hold our judgment until we see the actual tabulation of the results,\" National Security Spokesperson John Kirby said on Monday.",

        "text": "Harris and Trump release dueling ads as candidates refine their messaging\nKamala Harris and Donald Trump released dueling campaign ads on Tuesday, as the reshaped US presidential election began to grind into gear with 98 days to go.\n\nThe US vice-president\u2019s ad, Fearless, was her first since she became the de facto Democratic nominee, after Joe Biden halted his re-election campaign and endorsed her.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump wants to take our country backward,\u201d Harris said. \u201cTo give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations and end the Affordable Care Act. But we are not going back.\u201d\n\nThe former president\u2019s ad, I Don\u2019t Understand, used a snippet of Harris answering a question about immigration policy to bolster a hardline message about drugs, crime, terrorism and the southern border.\n\nShowing footage of her dancing, Trump\u2019s ad called Harris \u201cfailed, weak, dangerously liberal\u201d.\n\nHarris\u2019s campaign hit back against Trump, pointing to the Republican\u2019s role in directing congressional Republicans to reject bipartisan border reform.\n\n\u201cAfter killing the toughest border deal in decades, Donald Trump is running on his trademark lies because his own record and \u2018plans\u2019 are extreme and unpopular,\u201d Ammar Moussa, a Harris campaign spokesperson, told reporters.\n\nHarris has been the presumptive Democratic nominee for little more than a week \u2013 but she has made an extremely strong start, reeling in more than $200m and appearing to make up ground in the polls.\n\nShe is still considering her own vice-presidential pick. But on Monday, Trump\u2019s Republican running mate, the hardline Ohio senator JD Vance, was revealed to have made a telling admission about the strength of Harris\u2019s start.\n\nIn remarks at a fundraiser in Minnesota last weekend, reported by the Washington Post and referring to Biden\u2019s decision to give in to those who said he was too old for a second term, Vance said: \u201cAll of us were hit with a little bit of a political sucker punch.\n\n\u201cThe bad news is that Kamala Harris does not have the same baggage as Joe Biden, because whatever we might have to say, Kamala is a lot younger. And Kamala Harris is obviously not struggling in the same ways that Joe Biden did.\u201d\n\nBiden is 81, and Harris is 59. Trump is 78, making him the oldest presidential nominee of all time. The language of Harris\u2019s new ad pointed to Democratic determination to target Trump\u2019s age \u2013 and to portray him as backward-looking and a thing of the past, now that their own old man is out of the campaign picture.\n\nThe Harris campaign is also keen to point to its fundraising efforts, which as the new ad was released saw a \u201cWhite Dudes for Harris\u201d Zoom call featuring celebrities including the actor Jeff Bridges, who famously played Jeffrey \u201cThe Dude\u201d Lebowski. The campaign said it raised $4m.\n\nFive years before Bridges made The Big Lebowski, he played the lead role in Fearless, a 1993 movie about a man whose behaviour is changed after he survives a plane crash.\n\nIn a statement accompanying the Fearless ad, the Harris campaign chairperson, Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon, saluted Democrats\u2019 own dramatic shift in fortunes, from plummeting polls under Biden to soaring hopes under Harris.\n\n\u201cKamala Harris has always stood up to bullies, criminals and special interests on behalf of the American people \u2013 and she\u2019s beaten them,\u201d O\u2019Malley Dillon said, echoing the ad\u2019s citation of Harris\u2019s work as attorney general of California, as well as her time as a US senator and vice-president.\n\n\u201cThis $50m paid media campaign, bolstered by our record-setting fundraising haul and a groundswell of grassroots enthusiasm, is one crucial way we will reach and make our case to the voters who will decide this election.\u201d\n\nThe Harris campaign plans to air its ad prominently over three weeks, including amid coverage of the Olympic Games in Paris.\n\nThe Trump campaign is also reportedly focusing on Arizona, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Nevada, Georgia and Michigan \u2013 the key battleground states.",

        "text": "Harris or Trump? 'Nostradamus' of US presidential elections reveals who is on course to win\nUS election: Democrats candidate Kamala Harris and Republican candidate Donald Trump\n\nA forecaster, who has been making accurate predictions since 1984, has said that Kamal Harris can win the US presidential election .Professor Allen Lichtman , popularly known as the 'Nostradamus' of presidential elections, has updated his prediction model as US President Joe Biden announced his drop and backed Vice President Kamala Harris Lichtman's model measures factors against the party currently in the White House, which at this time is the Democrats, The Daily Mail reported.The professor of American University said he will make his official prediction for the election next month, but Harris has a majority of his keys leaning in her favor to win.'I plan to make my official prediction in August after the Democratic convention ,' Lichtman wrote on X. 'See my assessment below on the 13 Keys Tracker on where The Keys stand NOW.'Harris filed her nomination on July 27 officially and declared her candidature for President race.Harris has an upper hand in this election because of the several key factors like she faced no primary challenger, there has been minimal threat from third-party candidates, and the economy remains strong both in the short and long term.With the transition from Biden to Harris, the White House has avoided major policy changes, and Harris is not contending with any scandals or significant social unrest.Lichtman observed that with Biden\u2019s shift to Harris as the presumptive nominee, the Democrats have lost the incumbency advantage. As Harris and Republican candidate Donald Trump prepare to face off, Lichtman considers the race essentially open, reported The Daily Mail.However, Lichtman also pointed out that the Democrats have managed to mitigate potential fallout from this transition. The party has rallied behind Harris without triggering a chaotic open primary or attracting other presidential contenders at this late stage.\"I have not made a final prediction. I've said I will make it after the Democratic convention,\" Lichtman told C-SPAN.\"But I have said for months, and I continue to say a lot would have to go wrong for Democrats to lose... That could happen, but a lot would have to change.\"Lichtman also said the new energy injected into the Harris campaign could have a positive effect on several keys for her including less people voting for third party candidate Robert Kennedy Jr. and it could further stall social unrest.Lichtman's forecast comes as the latest polls show that Harris and Trump are in neck-to -neck competition in the presidential race.",

        "text": "Marianne Williamson 2024 presidential campaign\nAmerican political campaign\n\nMarianne Williamson, an author, political activist, and candidate for the Democratic Party presidential nomination in 2020, announced her campaign for the 2024 United States presidential election on March 4, 2023.[8] Williamson was the first major Democratic candidate to officially announce their candidacy,[9][10] as President Joe Biden did not announce his re-election bid until April 2023.[11] Williamson suspended her campaign on February 7, 2024, as a result of her losses in the New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada Democratic primaries. She later retracted her campaign suspension and officially rejoined the race on February 28, 2024, following her third place finish in the Michigan Democratic primary ahead of Dean Phillips, whose campaign was still active at the time. On June 11, 2024, Williamson announced her decision to suspend her campaign again. On July 2, 2024, Williamson again announced her decision to resume her campaign following calls for Biden to drop out after his performance at the June 27 presidential debate. On July 29, 2024, Williamson announced she did not file a run against Harris in the planned virtual roll call vote, ending her campaign.\n\nBackground [ edit ]\n\nWilliamson first ran for office in the 2014 U.S. House elections, seeking to represent California's 33rd congressional district as an independent. She placed third in the nonpartisan blanket primary and did not advance to the general election.[12] She later ran a campaign for the 2020 Democratic Party presidential nomination.[13] She formally ended her campaign on January 10, 2020,[14] endorsing Bernie Sanders and then Joe Biden as the nominee.[15][16]\n\nCampaign [ edit ]\n\nWilliamson speaking at a campaign event in Nashua, New Hampshire.\n\nAnnouncement and launch [ edit ]\n\nOn February 18, 2023, Williamson confirmed she would make \"an important announcement\" in Washington, D.C., on March 4 regarding the 2024 presidential election.[17] In an interview with Politico published the day before she teased the announcement, she said if she were to run, she would remain with the Democratic Party, in an apparent move to set up a primary challenge against incumbent President Joe Biden; she stated a factor into her decision would be to address what she described as Biden's \"message that the economy is getting stronger\".[18]\n\nWilliamson formally announced her candidacy in a twenty-minute speech she delivered at Union Station.[19] Facing steep competition in the primary against an incumbent, several journalists and commentators have deemed her campaign a \"long shot\".[20] Some Williamson supporters have criticized the media for focusing on their view of her as a long shot candidate, rather than on the substance of her platform.[21][better source needed][22][better source needed]\n\nIn late November 2023, Williamson and fellow Biden challengers, Dean Phillips and Cenk Uygur, claimed they were unfairly disqualified from getting on the Florida Democratic Party primary ballot, which the party discounted.[23] The following week, the underdog trio arranged to appear together and respond to the Republican candidates' December 6 debate and discuss their policy positions on Uygur's The Young Turks (TYT) network.[24][25]\n\nStaff relations [ edit ]\n\nWilliamson's campaign has had trouble with maintaining relations with her staff. In March 2023, Politico published a report detailing Williamson's alleged abuses towards her staffers on her 2020 campaign. The staffers, who remained anonymous due to having signed non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), described a toxic work environment. One reported it as, \"It would be foaming, spitting, uncontrollable rage.\" \"It was traumatic. And the experience, in the end, was terrifying.\" In contrast to her career message of love, she threw phones, some said, and shouted at them so intensely they were reduced to tears. Her anger over logistics in South Carolina had led her to strike a vehicle repeatedly, to the extent that her hand swelled so much she had to be transported for medical attention.[26] Williamson has called the article a \"distraction\" and a \"hit piece,\" but acknowledged she had room for personal growth.[27]\n\nOn May 20, 2023, Williamson's campaign manager Peter Daou announced via Twitter he was leaving the Williamson campaign,[28] citing a need to care for his and his wife's ailing parents,[29] and stating that he still \"believe[s] deeply in the campaign\u2019s platform.\"[30] Additionally, her deputy campaign manager Jason Call told Politico that he had resigned the day before, but refused to provide any more details.[28] In September 2023, Daou became the campaign manager for Cornel West's 2024 presidential run under the Green Party ticket.[31]\n\nIn June 2023, Williamson's second campaign manager, Roza Calderon, left the campaign, with a friend contending that Calderon had \"tried to right the ship and lead this campaign. Marianne knocked her down every chance she got.\"[32]\n\nIn early July 2023, six more staff members left the Williamson campaign in a mix of firings and resignations, which included her entire South Carolina team.[33] Reportedly, several staff members had been disappointed with Williamson about her lack of ballot access operations. Williamson announced a new book scheduled to come out in September 2023, which led one of the former staffers to call her campaign a \"grift\" for media attention to promote her new book.[34]\n\nIn January 2024, her third campaign manager, Carlos Cardona, resigned.[2]\n\nPrimaries [ edit ]\n\nWilliamson came in third place in the 2024 New Hampshire primary, with four percent of the vote.[35] Following the primary, she held a volunteer Zoom meeting where she announced a tentative decision to drop out of the race, but after the call was leaked to the X account OrganizerMemes, she decided to stay in.[36][37]\n\nShe received 2.1% of the vote, and zero delegates, in the 2024 South Carolina Democratic presidential primary on February 3, 2024,[38] which was the first state to earn delegates for Democratic candidates, as the New Hampshire primary was unsanctioned.[39] Williamson was on the ballot for the 2024 Nevada Democratic presidential primary on February 6, 2024, and received 3% of the vote causing her not win any delegates.[40]\n\nSuspensions and unsuspensions [ edit ]\n\nWilliamson suspended her campaign on February 7, 2024, following her losses in the New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada primaries, winning 5,016 votes (4.0%) in New Hampshire, 2,786 votes (2.1%) in South Carolina, and 3,909 votes (3.0%) in Nevada.[41]\n\nWilliamson announced on February 28, 2024, that she was \"unsuspending\" her presidential campaign following the over 100,000 votes for \"Uncommitted\" in the Michigan Democratic primary.[42][43]\n\nOn Super Tuesday, Williamson received about 200,000 of the more than six million votes cast. She was largely shut out of delegates, as she failed to break 15% of the vote in any states. Her best finishes were in Oklahoma, where she received 9.1% of the vote, and Virginia, where she received 7.8% of the vote.[citation needed]\n\nWilliamson announced on June 11 that she would leave the race.[44]\n\nOn July 2, Williamson reentered the race following criticism of Biden in the aftermath of his debate with Donald Trump.[45] Following Biden's suspension of his campaign and subsequent endorsement of Kamala Harris on July 21, Williamson continued calls for an open convention, arguing that the vice president should not be \"anointed to the position of nominee.\"[46]\n\nShe withdrew over a week later, on July 29, announcing that she did not file a run against Harris in the planned virtual roll call vote, ending her campaign.[47]\n\nPolitical positions [ edit ]\n\nDescribed as a progressive Democrat,[48] Williamson's policies are similar to those of her former 2020 rival Bernie Sanders,[49] whom she initially endorsed after exiting that race.[50] Sanders has likewise expressed praise for Williamson,[51] although he has endorsed Biden in the 2024 race.[52] According to ABC News, her priorities include free healthcare, free college, and free childcare.[53] Williamson promotes progressive and social democratic policies in the spirit of President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal, such as a 21st Century Economic Bill of Rights[54] promoted by her friend, campaign advisor and FDR historian, Harvey J. Kaye and Alan Minsky of the Progressive Democrats of America (PDA).[55][56]\n\nWilliamson has called for creating a Department of Peace,[57] which would promote peace and diplomacy, as well as a Department of Children and Youth, which Williamson says are severely neglected and calls the current treatment of children by the government \"collective neglection\".[57] She believes the United States needs mass-mobilization in order to prevent a climate catastrophe.[58] She also supports certain proposed constitutional amendments, such as the Equal Rights Amendment and a proposed amendment to enshrine rights for individuals who identify as LGBTQ+.[59]\n\nWilliamson expressed support for universal-basic-income during her 2020[60][61] and 2024 presidential runs.[62]\n\nPolling [ edit ]\n\nIn opinion polling, Williamson typically averaged around the high single digits in national polls.[63] The highest poll number recorded was 13% which she received in a November Fox News poll.[64]\n\nEndorsements [ edit ]\n\nSome early supporters of Williamson include actor Keith David,[65] as well as political commentators Krystal Ball and Kyle Kulinski.[66]",

Trump is calling out her past positions and statements at his rallies, and on Monday his campaign began reserving time for television advertisements that are likely to resurface videos of Ms. Harris.",

If a candidate secures six or more \u201ckeys,\u201d they are predicted to win the election.\n\nALSO READ| Kamala Harris to announce running mate in 6-7 days, 3 shortlisted candidates include...\n\nThe 13 keys to the White House are:\n\nParty mandate\n\nContest\n\nIncumbency\n\nThird party\n\nShort-term economy\n\nLong-term economy\n\nPolicy change\n\nSocial unrest\n\nScandal\n\nForeign/military failure\n\nForeign/military success\n\nIncumbent charisma\n\nChallenger charisma\n\nAt the start of the 2024 election year, the Democrats were automatically granted one \u201ckey\u201d due to President Biden's incumbency. However, much has changed politically since the times of forming that agreement. Should we go by the latest assessment by Lichtman, the front-runner in the Democratic party, Kamala Harris, currently holds the six keys out of the thirteen. These include pertaining to the primary contest, short-term economy, long-term economy, policy change, no scandal, and no challenger charisma.\n\nLichtman told News Nation that \u201ca lot would have to go wrong for Harris to lose.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, the Republicans hold three keys: winning the House majority in the 2022 midterms, the current incumbent not seeking re-election, and the current incumbent lacking charisma.\n\nALSO READ| Donald Trump blasts \u2018terrible\u2019 Paris Olympics opening ceremony: \u2018It was a disgrace\u2019\n\nThere are still four keys yet to be determined: the third party factor, which is significant due to Independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s presence in the race, as well as keys for social unrest, foreign military failure, and foreign military success.\n\nLichtman points out that, according to his formula, the Democrats would be projected to lose if they lose three more keys.",

        "text": "Why Trump supporters are accusing Sundar Pichai and Google of \u2018bias\u2019\nThe recent omission of an attempted assassination search result for former US President Donald Trump has sparked accusations of bias against Google. Supporters, including Donald Trump Jr. and Republican lawmakers, allege that Google\u2019s autocomplete function is deliberately suppressing information to favour Kamala Harris in the upcoming US presidential election read more\n\nRepublican presidential nominee and former US President Donald Trump gestures during a rally with his vice presidential running mate US Senator JD Vance in St. Cloud, Minnesota, US, July 27, 2024. File Image/Reuters\n\nThe controversy surrounding Google, led by Sundar Pichai, has escalated as Trump supporters accuse the tech giant of election interference. The issue arose when Google\u2019s autocomplete function failed to suggest information about an attempted assassination of former United States President Donald Trump, sparking outrage among his supporters.\n\nThe autocomplete feature provided suggestions for historical assassination attempts on figures like Ronald Reagan and John F Kennedy but did not include Trump, despite the incident occurring on July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis omission has led to accusations of bias against Google, with claims that the company is manipulating information to influence the upcoming 2024 US presidential election.\n\nHow have Republicans reacted?\n\nThe incident prompted a strong reaction from Trump supporters and prominent Republican figures. Donald Trump Jr. expressed his frustration on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, stating, \u201cBig Tech is trying to interfere in the election AGAIN to help Kamala Harris.\u201d\n\nBig Tech is trying to interfere in the election AGAIN to help Kamala Harris. We all know this is intentional election interference from Google. Truly despicable. https://t.co/gWDbFGaHI7 \u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) July 28, 2024\n\nHe accused Google of intentionally suppressing information about the assassination attempt, viewing it as an effort to aid US Vice President Kamala Harris in the election. Trump\u2019s supporters have long suspected Google of bias, especially given the company\u2019s alleged suppression of information related to US President Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepublican US Senator Roger Marshall also voiced his concerns, sharing a screenshot that highlighted Google\u2019s omission. He questioned, \u201cWhy is @Google suppressing the search about the Trump assassination attempt? Has there been a dramatic increase in (Harry) Truman biographers in the last two weeks?\u201d\n\nWhy is @Google suppressing the search about the Trump assassination attempt? These are all screenshots from this morning. Has there been a dramatic increase in Truman biographers in the last two weeks?\n\n\n\nI\u2019ll be making an official inquiry into @google this week - I look forward\u2026 pic.twitter.com/GD5SOvvcdX \u2014 Dr. Roger Marshall (@RogerMarshallMD) July 28, 2024\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe accusations extended to Pichai himself, with some suggesting that his Indian heritage influenced his supposed support for Harris, also of Indian descent. One post on X read, \u201cSundar Pichai top boss at google is\u2026doing everything in his power to ensure the next president is of India descent,\u201d while another labelled him a \u201csocialist\u201d favouring \u201cMarxists who run the DNC.\u201d\n\nHow did Google respond?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn response to the controversy, a Google spokesperson clarified that the company\u2019s systems have built-in protections against autocomplete predictions related to political violence, which were functioning as intended.\n\nSundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, attends the inauguration of a new hub in France dedicated to the artificial intelligence (AI) sector, at the Google France headquarters in Paris, France, February 15, 2024. File Image/Reuters\n\nThe spokesperson stated, \u201cWe\u2019re working on improvements to ensure our systems are more up to date. Of course, Autocomplete is just a tool to help people save time, and they can still search for anything they want to.\u201d Despite this explanation, the issue continued to draw criticism, with many arguing that the omission was a deliberate act of bias.\n\nHow did Musk & Meta get involved?\n\nElon Musk, owner of X, also became involved in the controversy. Musk, who has openly supported Trump, posted a screenshot showing a Google search for \u201cPresident Donald\u201d that suggested \u201cPresident Donald Duck\u201d instead of \u201cPresident Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWow, Google has a search ban on President Donald Trump!\n\n\n\nElection interference? pic.twitter.com/dJzgVAAFZA \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 29, 2024\n\nMusk sarcastically questioned whether this was an instance of \u201cElection interference?\u201d He further commented on the significant donations from Alphabet (Google\u2019s parent company) employees to Biden\u2019s campaign, implying a bias within the company.\n\nProbably just a coincidence that Alphabet (Google) employees were the top donors to Biden https://t.co/H02dxmKPkL pic.twitter.com/tIj0THeTVc \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 29, 2024\n\nMeta, another tech giant, faced criticism for a similar issue. The company\u2019s AI chatbot, Meta AI, was accused of providing misleading information about the Trump assassination attempt. In one instance, the bot incorrectly labelled the event as \u201cfictional.\u201d\n\nMeta later apologised, acknowledging that the incident was an error and stating, \u201cWe know people have been seeing incomplete, inconsistent, or out of date information on this topic. We\u2019re in the process of implementing a fix to provide more up-to-date responses for inquiries, and it is possible people may continue to see inaccurate responses in the meantime.\u201d\n\nWhat political implications are we looking at?\n\nThe allegations of bias against Google and other tech giants have significant political implications, especially as the US approaches the 2024 presidential election. Trump\u2019s supporters view the perceived manipulation of information as a form of election interference designed to disadvantage their candidate.\n\nThe controversy has fueled calls for investigations, with some Republican lawmakers pledging to look into the matter.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate former US President Donald Trump is surrounded by US Secret Service agents after an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, July 13, 2024. File Image/AP\n\nThe situation has also highlighted the broader issue of Big Tech\u2019s role in shaping public discourse and information. With past incidents of social media platforms banning Trump following the January 6, 2021, US Capitol riot, the debate over tech companies\u2019 influence in politics remains a hot topic.",

        "text": "Kamala Harris has a different view on Gaza to Joe Biden \u2013 it could win her votes in November \u2022 City, University of London\nDr Andrew Payne writes for The Conversation about how Kamala Harris' different stance on Israel/Gaza might win her more votes in the upcoming US presidential election.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu\u2019s July visit to Washington has placed the political spotlight on divisions within the Democratic party over the war in Gaza. After Joe Biden\u2019s withdrawal from the presidential race, the presumptive Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris, inherits a politically thorny issue. It\u2019s an issue that has plagued the president since the Hamas attacks in October 2023.\n\nHarris will need to strike a difficult balance between explaining how she would chart a distinctive path on Israel and Palestine, while also defending the record of an administration in which she still serves.\n\nThe vice president\u2019s record on the issue so far \u2013 and her decision not to preside over Netanyahu\u2019s speech in Congress \u2013 have stoked hopes in progressive circles that the she may adopt a tougher position towards Israel. Such a shift could be vital in convincing pro-Palestinian voters disillusioned with Biden to turn out for her in November.\n\nVice presidents tend to toe the party line on foreign affairs. But Harris has been unusually outspoken on US policy towards the Middle East. In December, for example, she delivered a speech in Dubai after meeting with leaders of several Arab states, in which she expressed concern about the scale of civilian suffering in Gaza.\n\nShe did reaffirm the Biden administration\u2019s position regarding Israel\u2019s right to defend itself against Hamas. But she also insisted that \u201cinternational humanitarian law must be respected\u201d, implying that Israel\u2019s conduct risked falling short of that standard. \u201cAs Israel defends itself, it matters how,\u201d she said.\n\nIn March, Harris was the first senior administration official to call for an \u201cimmediate ceasefire\u201d. She was again sharp in her criticism of the Israeli government\u2019s handling of the humanitarian dimensions of its war, which had led to \u201cinhumane conditions\u201d in Gaza.\n\nIn remarks that were strong enough to prompt National Security Council officials to intervene and tone them down, Harris declared: \u201cOur common humanity compels us to act.\u201d She called for Netanyahu\u2019s government to \u201cdo more to significantly increase the flow of aid. No excuses.\u201d\n\nRealistically, conventional political wisdom in the US suggests that Harris faces an uphill task in translating whatever daylight exists between her and Biden into electoral success in November. The US public is said to know little, and care less, about international affairs. So, when most people enter polling booths, it is kitchen-table issues \u2013 inflation, interest rates and immigration \u2013 that determine who wins their vote.\n\nIn fact, the proportion of Americans who rank any foreign policy issue among as the most important problem facing the country averages around 10%-20%. That\u2019s around three times less than the number who identify economic issues as their primary concern. The pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses earlier this year and the demonstrations in Washington this week may therefore exaggerate the importance of an issue that animates only a vocal minority.\n\nLeadership qualities\n\nBut recent research suggests that these stats may give a misleading impression of the way in which individuals assess political candidates. In practice, voters tend to care less about specific issues than whether a candidate has the right personal attributes to be an effective commander-in-chief.\n\nHarris\u2019s comments about the war may help her project a broader image as a leader who is prepared to stand up for certain values on the world stage, such as the importance of upholding international law and protecting human rights. This would be a marked contrast with the position of Donald Trump.\n\nTrump called on Biden during their now infamous 2024 debate in June to let Israel \u201cfinish the job\u201d without further restrictions from Washington, displaying few qualms about the way in which Israel prosecuted its war with Hamas.\n\nThis is important because we know that foreign policy may not feature heavily in polling, but has been shown to affect elections if voters are presented with a clear choice between candidates. Harris and Trump\u2019s positions on Israel illustrate that the choice in 2024 is between a candidate who is committed to defending the rules-based international order and one who has a track record of undermining it.\n\nThere is also a simple mathematical reason why this might matter in November. The outcome of this year\u2019s presidential election is likely to come down to fine margins in a handful of states. These include Michigan, where more than 100,000 young voters and Arab Americans demonstrated their dissatisfaction with the Biden administration\u2019s handling of the war in Gaza by casting \u201cuncommitted\u201d ballots in the state\u2019s Democratic primary in February. This in a state that Trump won in 2016 by just 11,000 votes (but lost in 2020).\n\nEven if foreign policy shifts few votes on a national scale, the position Harris takes on Gaza could be enough to tip the scale in these must-win races.\n\nWhere does this leave Joe Biden?\n\nAssuming he does not bow to pressure from Republican critics calling for his resignation, Biden will still serve as commander-in-chief for another six months. As I have argued in a recent book, presidents in the twilight of their term must still pay attention to the political calendar when making decisions about war and peace.\n\nLike many of his predecessors, Biden is likely to turn to foreign policy as a means of cementing his legacy. A ceasefire agreement in Gaza could be a promising scenario. If the administration were able to broker a deal between Israel and Hamas before the election, it would also help Harris by reducing the salience of a sensitive political issue.\n\nHaving stepped aside in favour of his vice president, Biden (belatedly) aims to become the transitional president he once promised to be. On Israel, he may indeed be the last of his kind.\n\nHarris could yet be the bridge between Biden\u2019s generation of Democratic leaders who share a deep personal bond with the state of Israel, and a younger group of progressives who are much more willing to criticise the policies of the Israeli government.\n\nDr Andrew Payne is a Lecturer in Foreign Policy and Security within the School of Policy & Global Affairs at City, University of London.

        "text": "Harris wipes out Trump\u2019s lead in polls of US presidential race\nDe facto Democratic nominee and Republican candidate now locked in a dead heat for the White House, polling shows.\n\nUnited States Vice President Kamala Harris has erased former President Donald Trump\u2019s lead in the race for the White House, with the Democratic and Republican standard-bearers now locked in a dead heat, newly released polling shows.\n\nHarris has closed the gap with Trump both nationwide and in key battleground states since becoming the de facto Democratic nominee following President Joe Biden\u2019s exit from the 2024 presidential race, according to a series of polls published on Tuesday.\n\nHarris is ahead of Trump in four key battleground states, while the former president is ahead in two, according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll of registered voters.\n\nHarris leads Trump in Michigan by 11 percentage points and by two points in Arizona, Wisconsin and Nevada, according to the poll.\n\nTrump has a four-point advantage in Pennsylvania and a two-point lead in North Carolina, while the pair are tied in Georgia.\n\nApart from Michigan and Pennsylvania, all of the results are within the margin of error.\n\nIf the outcome of the poll was replicated on election day, the candidate who won Georgia would be elected president.\n\nIn a poll commissioned by the Democratic super PAC Progress Action Fund, Harris leads Trump 48 percent to 47 percent in Georgia, with Trump ahead by two points in Arizona and Pennsylvania.\n\nAll the polling results, which were first published by The Hill, were within the margin of error.\n\nIn a nationwide Reuters/Ipsos poll, Harris leads Trump 43 percent to 42 percent, which is within the margin of error.\n\nThe slew of positive polling comes after Harris rapidly consolidated support among Democrats following Biden\u2019s decision to step aside after months of poor polling driven by concerns about his age and fitness.\n\nHarris, who will be formally named the Democratic nominee on Monday, is expected to announce her running mate within days before embarking on a tour of swing states that will decide the election on November 5.\n\nPennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly and Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, among others, have been floated as contenders for the vice presidential pick.\n\nDuring a campaign event in Atlanta, Georgia on Tuesday, Harris said that momentum in the race was shifting and there were signs Trump was \u201cfeeling it\u201d.\n\nHarris, who has taken aim at Trump\u2019s legal woes and stances on healthcare and abortion, challenged her rival to keep his commitment to debate her in September after the Republican said he could \u201cmake a case\u201d for skipping the event.\n\n\u201cWell Donald, I do hope you\u2019ll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause as the saying goes, \u2018If you\u2019ve got something to say, say it to my face.\u2019\u201d\n\nSince Biden\u2019s exit dramatically reshaped the race, Trump has sought to portray Harris, who ran to the left of her boss during her unsuccessful 2020 presidential run, as a candidate with extreme positions on issues including immigration and abortion.\n\nDuring a campaign rally in North Carolina last week, Trump lambasted the former California senator as a \u201cradical left-liberal, San Francisco extremist\u201d and claimed that she made Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, look like a moderate in comparison.\n\nTrump\u2019s running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance, on Tuesday returned to that theme during a campaign event in Nevada.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want a wacky San Francisco liberal serving as commander in chief,\u201d Vance said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want Kamala Harris.\u201d",

Several state-level polls in swing states since Harris announced her candidacy show a tighter race as well.\n\nThe candidates themselves have both implicitly and explicitly acknowledged the altered political map. On the airwaves, both campaigns are launching multimillion-dollar ad buys in the key battleground states. Harris\u2019 campaign is running a spot that highlights her background as a prosecutor and Trump\u2019s video attacks Harris as weak on immigration issues.\n\nHarris held a rally in Atlanta Tuesday night, the largest of the campaign so far, in front of thousands of supporters at Georgia State University\u2019s Convocation Center.\n\n\"Georgia, it is so good to be back, and I am very clear: The path to the White House runs right through this state,\" Harris said to a filled 10,000-person arena. \"And you all helped us win in 2020 \u2014 and we're gonna do it again in 2024!\"\n\nTrump and his vice presidential nominee, Ohio U.S. Sen. JD Vance, will hold a rally at the same location on Saturday.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nGeorgia in particular is seen as an opportunity for the Harris campaign to improve before Election Day.\n\nNearly a third of the electorate is Black, Atlanta\u2019s suburbs are home to a sizable share of moderate voters who have voted for Republicans and Democrats in past elections, and the Harris campaign says it is making record staffing investments.\n\n\u201cIn Georgia, we're running the largest in-state operation of any Democratic presidential campaign cycle ever,\u201d Harris campaign communications director Michael Tyler said to reporters. \u201cSince the vice president began her candidacy, we've seen tremendous energy on the ground.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign is not ceding focus on the Sun Belt, though.\n\nVance is campaigning in Nevada and Arizona this week, with a planned appearance at the U.S. southern border on Thursday.\n\nArizona and Georgia are also two primary states where Republicans' \"Trump Force 47\" campaign strategy to use volunteers to lead targeted get-out-the-vote efforts is in full swing.\n\nAs both Trump and Harris continue to make their case to voters in these swing states over the next three months, there are still several key events that could continue to shape the contour of the race, like Harris naming her vice presidential pick, the Democratic National Convention next month in Chicago and any potential debates between Trump and Harris before voting begins.\n\nHarris is set to announce her running mate within days, and the campaign says they will do a series of rallies, a tour that will begin on Tuesday and take them to Philadelphia, western Wisconsin, Detroit, Raleigh, N.C., Savannah, Ga., Phoenix and Las Vegas.\n\nNPR's Deepa Shivaram contributed reporting.",

However, the court is closely aligned with his government; the court\u2019s justices are proposed by federal officials and ratified by the National Assembly, which is dominated by Maduro sympathizers.\n\nThe Carter Center, which sent a delegation to Venezuela to monitor the election, criticized Maduro\u2019s audit request, saying the court would not provide an independent review.\n\n\u201cYou have another government institution, which is appointed by the government, to verify the government numbers for the election results, which are in question,\u201d said Jennie K. Lincoln, who led the delegation. \u201cThis is not an independent assessment.\u201d\n\nA defaced mural of the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez covers a wall on the side of a highway, next to historic Venezuelan national heroes, following protests against the official election results declaring Chavez\u2019s protege President Nicolas Maduro the winner, in Valencia, Venezuela, on Tuesday, July 30, 2024, two days after the vote.

Venezuela\u2019s electoral authorities allowed the Carter Center to send 17 observers.\n\nMaduro\u2019s main challenger, Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, and opposition leader Maria Corina Machado say they obtained more than two-thirds of the tally sheets that each electronic voting machine printed after polls closed. They said the release of the data on those tallies would prove Maduro lost.\n\nMaduro insisted to reporters that there had been a plot against his government and that the electoral system was hacked. Asked later on during a news conference why electoral authorities have not released detailed vote counts, Maduro said the National Electoral Council has come under attack, including cyber-attacks.\n\n\u201cEngineers are fighting right now\u201d to solve those attacks, he said without elaborating.\n\nThe government presented some videos that the president said showed people attacking and torching some electoral offices.

With the upcoming U.S. presidential election and Trump and Vance\u2019s criticisms of the alliance, NATO\u2019s future is effectively on the ballot, some foreign policy experts say.\n\nTrump has frequently criticized NATO countries for placing a financial burden on the U.S., warning that if they do not increase their contributions, he might consider reducing America\u2019s involvement in the alliance or withdrawing completely.\n\n\u201cNATO has to treat the U.S. fairly, because if it\u2019s not for the United States, NATO literally doesn\u2019t even exist,\u201d Trump said in a March interview.\n\nThe U.S. spent 3.49% of its GDP on defense in 2023, while 19 of 32 NATO countries failed to reach the 2% commitment. This year, 23 out of 32 countries are expected to meet or exceed the defense-spending target, according to NATO.\n\nRELATED\n\nEmbracing Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy platform, Trump and Vance favor isolationism. This raises the question: What does this mean for NATO member countries in need of American assistance, especially Ukraine and neighboring countries around Russia?\n\nEven if Vice President Kamala Harris \u2014 the anticipated Democratic presidential nominee \u2014 wins the election in November, NATO may still face challenges.\n\nA Trump and Vance ticket\n\nKlaus Larres, a history professor at the University of North Carolina and a fellow at the Wilson Center, noted that not all campaign rhetoric translates into actions once in office.\n\nTrump is more skeptical of NATO than President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, but since more countries are meeting the defense spending commitment, that grievance may diminish, Larres said.\n\n\u201cHe probably will not repeat again that he wants to leave NATO, but he probably will make the United States less active in NATO and less prominent and less being the clear leader of NATO,\u201d he said.\n\nLarres said Vance\u2019s inexperience in foreign policy will require a steep learning curve, which could prompt him to reconsider his instinctive isolationism.\n\n\u201cHe is an isolationist, and he wants to withdraw from Ukraine,\u201d Larres said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to see how detrimental that also would be for the United States and not just for the Europeans or for Ukraine, that it would have really devastating effects on America\u2019s role in the world. He doesn\u2019t seem to understand that.\u201d\n\nWith 40% of global trade involving the U.S. and Europe, a serious strain in relations would harm America not only in security but also in trade and economic policy, Larres said.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump and Republican vice presidential candidate Sen.

Harris, who as of this writing has not announced a vice presidential candidate, will face a formal nomination at the Democratic National Convention in August.\n\nDuring his presidency, Biden expanded and defended NATO while bringing the Atlantic allies closer together, Larres said. Foreign policy experts expect Harris to continue support for NATO and Ukraine.\n\nIn contrast to the Republican ticket, Harris has indicated she would not stray from NATO.\n\n\u201cI firmly believe our commitment to build and sustain alliances has helped America become the most powerful and prosperous country in the world \u2014 alliances that have prevented wars, defended freedom and maintained stability from Europe to the Indo-Pacific,\u201d Harris said at the Munich Security Conference in February.\n\n\u201cTo put all of that at risk would be foolish,\u201d Harris said.\n\nIn a February rally, Trump said he would encourage Russia to do \u201cwhatever the hell they want\u201d to any NATO country that doesn\u2019t meet the defense spending commitment.\n\nIn response, Harris criticized Trump\u2019s remarks and reaffirmed her opposition to Russian President Vladimir Putin and the war in Ukraine.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris speaks to supporters during a campaign rally at West Allis Central High School on July 23 in West Allis, Wisconsin. (Photo by Jim Vondruska/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cNo previous U.S. president, regardless of party, has bowed down to a Russian dictator before,\u201d Harris said in an interview.\n\nIn the days leading up to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Harris urged NATO countries to unite and prepare sanctions.\n\nDuring her Munich speech, Harris warned against American isolationism, stating abandoning Ukraine or NATO allies would repeat historical mistakes.\n\n\u201cIf we stand by while an aggressor invades its neighbor with impunity, they will keep going,\u201d she said, noting Putin\u2019s actions could threaten all of Europe.\n\n\u201cIf we fail to impose severe consequences on Russia, other authoritarians across the globe would be emboldened, because you see, they will be watching \u2014 they are watching and drawing lessons.\u201d\n\nThe \u2018bedrock\u2019 of NATO\n\nForeign policy experts warned diminishing America\u2019s involvement in NATO could signal to adversaries abroad they can take advantage of U.S. allies, as America\u2019s military strength is a key deterrent.\n\nElizabeth Saunders, a professor of political science at Columbia University and a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said the U.S. military is the \u201cbedrock\u201d of NATO, and the U.S. nuclear program is still a key part of how NATO deters adversaries, like Russia.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very clear that this dance that NATO countries and Russia are doing on the sort of outer edges of this conflict are designed to prevent direct hostilities between any NATO country and Russia, and that\u2019s why Ukraine rightly believes that its security is tied to whether or not because it can get into NATO,\u201d Saunders said.\n\nOn his campaign website, Trump argued \u201cwe have to finish the process we began under my Administration of fundamentally reevaluating NATO\u2019s purpose and NATO\u2019s mission,\u201d claiming Russia is not the greatest threat to the U.S.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to believe that Russia is the greatest threat to the U.S. to think that it is a threat to U.S. interests,\u201d Saunders said.\n\nHans Binnendijk, a fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security and an adjunct political scientist at the RAND Corporation, said the most acute risk to the U.S. is Russia because the war in Ukraine has the potential for escalation.\n\n\u201cSo, if the alliance is significantly weakened, [Putin] may feel that he can take advantage of that and he goes into the Baltic states, for example, which would be very dangerous,\u201d Binnendijk said.\n\nNATO heads of state and government gathered on the 75th anniversary of NATO's creation in Washington, D.C., on July 9. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nBecause NATO relies heavily on the U.S. for nuclear deterrence, undermining the alliance would weaken its effectiveness, Binnendijk said. As he sees it, the most immediate risk of a Trump and Vance win is Congress failing to agree on future aid for Ukraine. He noted delays in past aid bills have led to shortages of air defense and artillery munitions for Ukraine.\n\n\u201cIf the U.S. just decides to stop aid to Ukraine, Europe can pick up some of it, but certainly not all of it, and it would probably force Ukraine into a very unfavorable situation where they might have to cut a really bad deal with Putin that would in turn do a lot of damage internally to the alliance,\u201d he said.\n\nEven if Trump doesn\u2019t formally withdraw the U.S. from NATO, he could still reduce America\u2019s involvement in ways that undermine the alliance and leave other member countries more vulnerable, Saunders said.\n\nFor example, Trump could refuse to appoint an ambassador to NATO or withdraw U.S. troops from allied countries, Saunders said.\n\n\u201cBut if the fundamentals, if the material and the personnel and the capabilities that you need come from the U.S., then if you don\u2019t have access to those, then you don\u2019t really have NATO in its current form,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cYou have something else that might still be called NATO.\u201d\n\nCristina Stassis is an editorial fellow for Defense News and Military Times, where she covers stories surrounding the defense industry, national security, military/veteran affairs and more.

This is what the Democrats have experienced ever since President Joe Biden decided to end his election campaign. Vice-President Kamala Harris who has secured the support of the required number of delegates is all set to receive the presidential nomination from the party during the national convention from August 19-22.A survey conducted by the Angus Reid Institute has found that overall, Harris has a two percent lead over her opponent. Different sections of the voters support different candidates and the issues are plenty including security, economy , cost of living and various foreign policy related issues. The upcoming presidential election in November is being seen as the most important election in the country\u2019s history with 82% of the registered voters who were surveyed believing in the same.Overall, 44% of the registered voters have extended their support to Harris and 42% of them support Trump. Harris has a marginal lead of over 2%.The young, non-white voters prefer Kamala Harris whereas the white male voters prefer to support Donald Trump . Among the non-white voters, Harris has a clear advantage with over 56% of the respondents reposing their faith in her, in comparison to only 25% of them extending their support to Trump.The same outcomes are seen among voters who are below 35-years of age with half of the voters (50%) supporting Harris and only 32% of them supporting Trump.For Trump, while he is lagging behind in terms of support from the non-white and voters below the age of 35, he leads among the White voters with 51% of them supporting him in comparison to only 37% extending their support to Harris.Both the candidates are tied when it comes to support from those in the age group of 35-54. For the voters who are aged above 55, Trump has a clear 9% lead over Harris with 49% of them supporting him and only 40% of them supporting Harris.The Democrats are fighting this upcoming election on issues such as saving democracy, reproductive rights and importance of climate change whereas the Republicans under Trump are fighting the election on issues pertaining to a muscular foreign policy, economy related issues and curbing immigration from the southern border.On the issue of security at the southern border, an overwhelming 52% of the respondents believe that Trump will do a better job in comparison to Harris. Similarly, the same has been recorded on the issues of foreign policy and economic revival.Whereas on the issue of climate change, protection of democracy and reproductive rights, Harris performs better. For example, on the issue of protecting reproductive rights, 55% of the respondents said that Harris is expected to perform better as compared to Trump.The survey was conducted among 1743 registered American voters who are part of the Angus Reid Forum USA and this survey was conducted from July 23-25, 2024.According to this survey, 21% of Harris voters and 87% of Trump supporters support the mass deportation of illegal immigrants. This signifies that Harris cannot afford to ignore this issue as 21% of her voters have an important say on this matter. She will have to speak on this issue and formulate a policy which is neither extreme nor what is viewed as appeasing to a section of the electorate.72% of the voters believe that the economy is the most important issues. The other key issues are the future of American Democracy (69%) and inflation (68%).",

        "text": "HKS experts evaluate media coverage of the careening U.S. election\nQ: Even major news organizations are facing huge problems just keeping their audiences and staying afloat. What do these economic challenges mean for covering this election?\n\nGibbs: The disruption of the business model for journalism drives many of the troubling trends of recent years; the increase in clickbait, in partisan media, in echo chambers designed to maximize engagement as companies shift from an advertising-based model to a subscription model. But maybe most concerning is if reliable information increasingly becomes a luxury good: those able and willing to pay for the Wall Street Journal or New York Times will have vast amounts of information available to them, but for others, the vacuum will be filled by unreliable and often destructive information sources.\n\nPatterson: I honestly don\u2019t think that the business model has posed a large challenge to presidential election coverage. We don\u2019t lack stories of those candidates. It\u2019s the lower races where the economic challenge is being felt. Most local news outlets have fewer resources to devote to covering Senate, House, and state-level campaigns.\n\n\n\nQ: How should news organizations follow up their breaking news coverage of the near-miss assassination attempt against former President Trump? Is there a risk of overplaying the threat of political violence? Or understating it?\n\nPatterson: Political assassinations and near-misses are relatively rare in American politics and don\u2019t fit a clear pattern. Some would-be assassins have been true believers, others have been loners or unhinged, and others have borne a personal grudge. We haven\u2019t had a case of a copy-cat assassin, which might be the only risk to life of overplaying the latest one.\n\n\n\nQ: There was intense coverage of whether President Biden should remain in the race\u2014sometimes breathless minute-by-minute analysis of polls. Was this horse race coverage warranted so far ahead of the voting? And did Donald Trump escape similar scrutiny about his age and health?\n\nGibbs: I share many people\u2019s concerns about journalists relying too heavily on polls and horse race coverage at the expense of deep reporting into the stakes and the policy implications of competing campaigns. But in this case, the coverage reflected concerns that voters had been sharing literally for years; Biden\u2019s age was a constant subject of concern even among voters who strongly supported his policies. If anything, the coverage ran behind public opinion rather than ahead of it. And while Trump\u2019s disapproval ratings have been consistently high, his age was not at the top of the list of concerns, compared with his lawlessness, his callousness, or his bigotry.\n\n\n\nQ: With Kamala Harris suddenly all but ordained as the Democratic frontrunner after Biden\u2019s withdrawal, how should reporters measure her candidacy and her campaign?",

        "text": "Iran trying to undercut Trump campaign and Russia doing opposite, U.S. officials indicate\nIran has started an influence campaign designed to undercut the candidacy of former President Donald Trump, U.S. officials indicated Monday, in an apparent reprisal of a 2020 effort that U.S. intelligence agencies found with high confidence had been authorized by Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.\n\nThe update came from officials with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), FBI and Department of Homeland Security who held a joint election security briefing 99 days before Election Day. The briefing was the second in a series the agencies expect to give before that day, and the officials spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss sensitive assessments.\n\n\"Since our last update, the [intelligence community] has observed Tehran working to influence the presidential election, probably because Iranian leaders want to avoid an outcome they perceive would increase tensions with the United States,\" a senior ODNI official said, adding, \"Iran's preference is essentially a reflection of its desire to not worsen tensions with the United States, and Iran is opposing the candidate that Iran's leaders perceive would increase those tensions.\"\n\nThe officials did not explicitly name the Trump campaign and referred instead to the key findings of the 2020 assessment. They also stressed that most of Iran's online activities, which they said rely on a \"vast web\" of internet personas, have been focused on stoking chaos and societal divisions, including over the war in Gaza.\n\nThe officials who briefed reporters Monday declined to offer additional details on the extent to which Iran is backing Gaza-related protests in the U.S., an effort revealed earlier this month in a statement from Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines.\n\nIn the statement, issued on July 9, Haines said the intelligence community had \"observed actors tied to Iran's government posing as activists online seeking to encourage protests and even providing financial support to protesters.\"\n\n\"We can't comment on the scale of the activities,\" the ODNI official said Monday. \"We can say there is great concern given their efforts to engage U.S. persons directly in the activity or through another entity as a cutout.\"\n\nDifferent direction for Russia\n\nIran's efforts to undermine the Trump campaign appear for the moment to be at cross-purposes with simultaneous efforts by Russia to influence the election in Trump's favor, even as the two countries have forged closer ties over the course of the war in Ukraine. Biden administration officials revealed last year that Iranian is attempting to help Russia build a drone factory on Russian soil in exchange for military equipment.\n\nU.S. officials have indicated the Kremlin is again working in this election cycle to boost Trump's candidacy, as it did in 2016 and 2020, though they did not directly name his campaign.\n\n\"We have not observed a shift in Russia's preferences for the presidential race from past elections, given the role the U.S. is playing with regard to Ukraine and broader policy towards Russia,\" an ODNI official said in a July 9 election security update. The 2020 assessment noted Russian president Vladimir Putin authorized a range of operations aimed at denigrating the Biden campaign and supporting Trump, as well as stoking societal divisions among Americans.\n\nOn Monday, the senior ODNI official said Russia's efforts \"would not have been authorized or allowed without believing they're consistent with Putin's views.\"\n\n\"As to Iran, some of Iran's primary influence actors operate under the [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps], which has a direct line to the Supreme Leader,\" the official added.\n\nChina may be eyeing down-ballot races\n\nWhile China has the capability to wage similar influence campaigns, U.S. intelligence agencies do not currently believe Beijing will seek to meddle in the presidential race due to concern that would damage the already tenuous bilateral relationship. Officials are monitoring the potential, however, that actors linked to China may work to denigrate down-ballot candidates, according to Monday's update.\n\nGenerally, foreign actors are \"closely monitoring U.S. political developments, especially the events that occurred this month regarding the presidential race,\" the ODNI official said, though the briefers declined to discuss whether or how either the failed assassination attempt on Trump or Mr. Biden's decision to withdraw his candidacy had factored into any ongoing operations.\n\nOfficials also warned that Russia and China in particular have been enlisting commercial marketing and public relations firms to \"better hide their hand\" in influence efforts.\n\n\"Fundamentally, foreign countries are calculating that Americans are more likely to believe other Americans compared to content with clear signs of foreign propaganda,\" the ODNI official said. \"Foreign actors continue to rely on witting and unwitting Americans to seed, promote and add credibility to narratives that serve the foreign actors' interests.\"\n\nOfficials declined to specify where any of the firms are currently operating or whether U.S. law enforcement agencies had opened any investigations into their employees or operations.",

It is anticipated that for the first time, more than half of the global population will be eligible to vote.\nTo be eligible to vote in the US presidential election, you must be a US citizen. It is poised to be a critical election year in the US, with immigration remaining a hot campaign topic.\nThis blog discusses the process of becoming a US citizen (e.g., naturalization) and the benefits. Interested applicants are encouraged to proceed without delay. While the application process can be overwhelming, many resources can assist.\nNaturalization Overview\nNaturalization is the process of becoming an American citizen if you were born outside of the US. To be eligible for citizenship, you must meet the following criteria:\nProcessing times for naturalization applications can vary depending on where you live. During an election year, we have observed the immigration service accelerate processing times resulting in quicker approvals, making it a good time to apply.\nBenefits of Applying for US Citizenship\nUS citizens enjoy many benefits that are not available to lawful permanent residents (e.g., green card holders). Some of those benefits include:\nIn addition, policies surrounding international travel can be heavily influenced by the presidential elections, which can lead to uncertainty and unpredictability for lawful permanent residents.\nFor example, in 2020, former President Trump issued several executive orders restricting travel for visa holders and permanent residents (even in some emergency circumstances). While some of those orders were implemented due to the global pandemic, the suddenness by which some of the orders were issued left many people anxious and stranded.

It is anticipated that for the first time, more than half of the global population will be eligible to vote.\nTo be eligible to vote in the US presidential election, you must be a US citizen. It is poised to be a critical election year in the US, with immigration remaining a hot campaign topic.\nThis blog discusses the process of becoming a US citizen (e.g., naturalization) and the benefits. Interested applicants are encouraged to proceed without delay. While the application process can be overwhelming, many resources can assist.\nNaturalization Overview\nNaturalization is the process of becoming an American citizen if you were born outside of the US. To be eligible for citizenship, you must meet the following criteria:\n\n\n\n\n\nBe at least 18 years of age;\nHave been a lawful permanent resident for at least five years and physically present in the United States for at least 30 months within the last five years;\n                                  \n\n\nIf married to a US citizen, have been a lawful permanent resident for at least three years and physically present in the US for 18 months out of the last three years.\n\n\n\n\nBe able to read, write and speak basic English;\nHave a basic understanding of US history and government;\nBe a person of good moral character, attached to the principles of the US Constitution, and well-disposed to the good order and happiness of the US.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcessing times for naturalization applications can vary depending on where you live. During an election year, we have observed the immigration service accelerate processing times resulting in quicker approvals, making it a good time to apply.\nBenefits of Applying for US Citizenship\nUS citizens enjoy many benefits that are not available to lawful permanent residents (e.g., green card holders). Some of those benefits include:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe right to vote in local, state and federal elections;\nProtection from deportation;\nEligibility to petition for family members;\nElimination of the requirement to renew your green card;\nRight to apply for federal benefits without restriction;\nAutomatic acquisition of citizenship for children under 18 in the custody of the naturalizing parent;\nTravel without restrictions \u2013 US passport holders can travel to many countries without a visa; and\nAbility to take lengthy absences from the US without the worry that you may have abandoned your residency.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, policies surrounding international travel can be heavily influenced by the presidential elections, which can lead to uncertainty and unpredictability for lawful permanent residents.\nFor example, in 2020, former President Trump issued several executive orders restricting travel for visa holders and permanent residents (even in some emergency circumstances). While some of those orders were implemented due to the global pandemic, the suddenness by which some of the orders were issued left many people anxious and stranded. US citizens were (and continue to be) protected from these types of travel restrictions.\nA change in administration could also lead to an increase in the promotion of employment opportunities for US citizens versus visa holders or lawful permanent residents.\nNeed to Know More?\nThis blog outlines just some of the reasons why eligible applicants may want to consider applying for naturalization at this time. As always, consulting with an immigration attorney is crucial to understanding the nuances of naturalization and ensuring a successful application process.\nFor more information on pursuing naturalization, please contact Partner Isha Atassi at [email\u00a0protected] and Senior Associate Kimberly Tracey at [email\u00a0protected].\nThis blog was published on July 31, 2024, and due to the circumstances, there are frequent changes.

It is anticipated that for the first time, more than half of the global population will be eligible to vote.\nTo be eligible to vote in the US presidential election, you must be a US citizen. It is poised to be a critical election year in the US, with immigration remaining a hot campaign topic.\nThis blog discusses the process of becoming a US citizen (e.g., naturalization) and the benefits. Interested applicants are encouraged to proceed without delay. While the application process can be overwhelming, many resources can assist.\nNaturalization Overview\nNaturalization is the process of becoming an American citizen if you were born outside of the US. To be eligible for citizenship, you must meet the following criteria:\n\n\n\n\n\nBe at least 18 years of age;\nHave been a lawful permanent resident for at least five years and physically present in the United States for at least 30 months within the last five years;\n                                  \n\n\nIf married to a US citizen, have been a lawful permanent resident for at least three years and physically present in the US for 18 months out of the last three years.\n\n\n\n\nBe able to read, write and speak basic English;\nHave a basic understanding of US history and government;\nBe a person of good moral character, attached to the principles of the US Constitution, and well-disposed to the good order and happiness of the US.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcessing times for naturalization applications can vary depending on where you live. During an election year, we have observed the immigration service accelerate processing times resulting in quicker approvals, making it a good time to apply.\nBenefits of Applying for US Citizenship\nUS citizens enjoy many benefits that are not available to lawful permanent residents (e.g., green card holders). Some of those benefits include:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe right to vote in local, state and federal elections;\nProtection from deportation;\nEligibility to petition for family members;\nElimination of the requirement to renew your green card;\nRight to apply for federal benefits without restriction;\nAutomatic acquisition of citizenship for children under 18 in the custody of the naturalizing parent;\nTravel without restrictions \u2013 US passport holders can travel to many countries without a visa; and\nAbility to take lengthy absences from the US without the worry that you may have abandoned your residency.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, policies surrounding international travel can be heavily influenced by the presidential elections, which can lead to uncertainty and unpredictability for lawful permanent residents.\nFor example, in 2020, former President Trump issued several executive orders restricting travel for visa holders and permanent residents (even in some emergency circumstances). While some of those orders were implemented due to the global pandemic, the suddenness by which some of the orders were issued left many people anxious and stranded. US citizens were (and continue to be) protected from these types of travel restrictions.\nA change in administration could also lead to an increase in the promotion of employment opportunities for US citizens versus visa holders or lawful permanent residents.\nNeed to Know More?\nThis blog outlines just some of the reasons why eligible applicants may want to consider applying for naturalization at this time. As always, consulting with an immigration attorney is crucial to understanding the nuances of naturalization and ensuring a successful application process.\nFor more information on pursuing naturalization, please contact Partner Isha Atassi at [email\u00a0protected] and Senior Associate Kimberly Tracey at [email\u00a0protected].\nThis blog was published on July 31, 2024, and due to the circumstances, there are frequent changes.

has been dubbed the \u201cSuper Election\u201d year, as it is the biggest election year in history.\nThis year, more than 70 elections will take place around the world, and the US is no exception. It is anticipated that for the first time, more than half of the global population will be eligible to vote.\nTo be eligible to vote in the US presidential election, you must be a US citizen. It is poised to be a critical election year in the US, with immigration remaining a hot campaign topic.\nThis blog discusses the process of becoming a US citizen (e.g., naturalization) and the benefits. Interested applicants are encouraged to proceed without delay. While the application process can be overwhelming, many resources can assist.\nNaturalization Overview\nNaturalization is the process of becoming an American citizen if you were born outside of the US. To be eligible for citizenship, you must meet the following criteria:\n\n\n\n\n\nBe at least 18 years of age;\nHave been a lawful permanent resident for at least five years and physically present in the United States for at least 30 months within the last five years;\n                                  \n\n\nIf married to a US citizen, have been a lawful permanent resident for at least three years and physically present in the US for 18 months out of the last three years.\n\n\n\n\nBe able to read, write and speak basic English;\nHave a basic understanding of US history and government;\nBe a person of good moral character, attached to the principles of the US Constitution, and well-disposed to the good order and happiness of the US.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcessing times for naturalization applications can vary depending on where you live. During an election year, we have observed the immigration service accelerate processing times resulting in quicker approvals, making it a good time to apply.\nBenefits of Applying for US Citizenship\nUS citizens enjoy many benefits that are not available to lawful permanent residents (e.g., green card holders). Some of those benefits include:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe right to vote in local, state and federal elections;\nProtection from deportation;\nEligibility to petition for family members;\nElimination of the requirement to renew your green card;\nRight to apply for federal benefits without restriction;\nAutomatic acquisition of citizenship for children under 18 in the custody of the naturalizing parent;\nTravel without restrictions \u2013 US passport holders can travel to many countries without a visa; and\nAbility to take lengthy absences from the US without the worry that you may have abandoned your residency.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, policies surrounding international travel can be heavily influenced by the presidential elections, which can lead to uncertainty and unpredictability for lawful permanent residents.\nFor example, in 2020, former President Trump issued several executive orders restricting travel for visa holders and permanent residents (even in some emergency circumstances). While some of those orders were implemented due to the global pandemic, the suddenness by which some of the orders were issued left many people anxious and stranded. US citizens were (and continue to be) protected from these types of travel restrictions.\nA change in administration could also lead to an increase in the promotion of employment opportunities for US citizens versus visa holders or lawful permanent residents.\nNeed to Know More?\nThis blog outlines just some of the reasons why eligible applicants may want to consider applying for naturalization at this time. As always, consulting with an immigration attorney is crucial to understanding the nuances of naturalization and ensuring a successful application process.\nFor more information on pursuing naturalization, please contact Partner Isha Atassi at [email\u00a0protected] and Senior Associate Kimberly Tracey at [email\u00a0protected].\nThis blog was published on July 31, 2024, and due to the circumstances, there are frequent changes.

It is anticipated that for the first time, more than half of the global population will be eligible to vote.\nTo be eligible to vote in the US presidential election, you must be a US citizen. It is poised to be a critical election year in the US, with immigration remaining a hot campaign topic.\nThis blog discusses the process of becoming a US citizen (e.g., naturalization) and the benefits. Interested applicants are encouraged to proceed without delay. While the application process can be overwhelming, many resources can assist.\nNaturalization Overview\nNaturalization is the process of becoming an American citizen if you were born outside of the US. To be eligible for citizenship, you must meet the following criteria:\n\n\n\n\n\nBe at least 18 years of age;\nHave been a lawful permanent resident for at least five years and physically present in the United States for at least 30 months within the last five years;\n                                  \n\n\nIf married to a US citizen, have been a lawful permanent resident for at least three years and physically present in the US for 18 months out of the last three years.\n\n\n\n\nBe able to read, write and speak basic English;\nHave a basic understanding of US history and government;\nBe a person of good moral character, attached to the principles of the US Constitution, and well-disposed to the good order and happiness of the US.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcessing times for naturalization applications can vary depending on where you live. During an election year, we have observed the immigration service accelerate processing times resulting in quicker approvals, making it a good time to apply.\nBenefits of Applying for US Citizenship\nUS citizens enjoy many benefits that are not available to lawful permanent residents (e.g., green card holders). Some of those benefits include:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe right to vote in local, state and federal elections;\nProtection from deportation;\nEligibility to petition for family members;\nElimination of the requirement to renew your green card;\nRight to apply for federal benefits without restriction;\nAutomatic acquisition of citizenship for children under 18 in the custody of the naturalizing parent;\nTravel without restrictions \u2013 US passport holders can travel to many countries without a visa; and\nAbility to take lengthy absences from the US without the worry that you may have abandoned your residency.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, policies surrounding international travel can be heavily influenced by the presidential elections, which can lead to uncertainty and unpredictability for lawful permanent residents.\nFor example, in 2020, former President Trump issued several executive orders restricting travel for visa holders and permanent residents (even in some emergency circumstances). While some of those orders were implemented due to the global pandemic, the suddenness by which some of the orders were issued left many people anxious and stranded. US citizens were (and continue to be) protected from these types of travel restrictions.\nA change in administration could also lead to an increase in the promotion of employment opportunities for US citizens versus visa holders or lawful permanent residents.\nNeed to Know More?\nThis blog outlines just some of the reasons why eligible applicants may want to consider applying for naturalization at this time. As always, consulting with an immigration attorney is crucial to understanding the nuances of naturalization and ensuring a successful application process.\nFor more information on pursuing naturalization, please contact Partner Isha Atassi at [email\u00a0protected] and Senior Associate Kimberly Tracey at [email\u00a0protected].\nThis blog was published on July 31, 2024, and due to the circumstances, there are frequent changes.

Isha Atassi, Kimberly Tracey\nAcross the world, 2024 has been dubbed the \u201cSuper Election\u201d year, as it is the biggest election year in history.\nThis year, more than 70 elections will take place around the world, and the US is no exception. It is anticipated that for the first time, more than half of the global population will be eligible to vote.\nTo be eligible to vote in the US presidential election, you must be a US citizen. It is poised to be a critical election year in the US, with immigration remaining a hot campaign topic.\nThis blog discusses the process of becoming a US citizen (e.g., naturalization) and the benefits. Interested applicants are encouraged to proceed without delay. While the application process can be overwhelming, many resources can assist.\nNaturalization Overview\nNaturalization is the process of becoming an American citizen if you were born outside of the US. To be eligible for citizenship, you must meet the following criteria:\n\n\n\n\n\nBe at least 18 years of age;\nHave been a lawful permanent resident for at least five years and physically present in the United States for at least 30 months within the last five years;\n                                  \n\n\nIf married to a US citizen, have been a lawful permanent resident for at least three years and physically present in the US for 18 months out of the last three years.\n\n\n\n\nBe able to read, write and speak basic English;\nHave a basic understanding of US history and government;\nBe a person of good moral character, attached to the principles of the US Constitution, and well-disposed to the good order and happiness of the US.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcessing times for naturalization applications can vary depending on where you live. During an election year, we have observed the immigration service accelerate processing times resulting in quicker approvals, making it a good time to apply.\nBenefits of Applying for US Citizenship\nUS citizens enjoy many benefits that are not available to lawful permanent residents (e.g., green card holders). Some of those benefits include:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe right to vote in local, state and federal elections;\nProtection from deportation;\nEligibility to petition for family members;\nElimination of the requirement to renew your green card;\nRight to apply for federal benefits without restriction;\nAutomatic acquisition of citizenship for children under 18 in the custody of the naturalizing parent;\nTravel without restrictions \u2013 US passport holders can travel to many countries without a visa; and\nAbility to take lengthy absences from the US without the worry that you may have abandoned your residency.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, policies surrounding international travel can be heavily influenced by the presidential elections, which can lead to uncertainty and unpredictability for lawful permanent residents.\nFor example, in 2020, former President Trump issued several executive orders restricting travel for visa holders and permanent residents (even in some emergency circumstances). While some of those orders were implemented due to the global pandemic, the suddenness by which some of the orders were issued left many people anxious and stranded. US citizens were (and continue to be) protected from these types of travel restrictions.\nA change in administration could also lead to an increase in the promotion of employment opportunities for US citizens versus visa holders or lawful permanent residents.\nNeed to Know More?\nThis blog outlines just some of the reasons why eligible applicants may want to consider applying for naturalization at this time. As always, consulting with an immigration attorney is crucial to understanding the nuances of naturalization and ensuring a successful application process.\nFor more information on pursuing naturalization, please contact Partner Isha Atassi at [email\u00a0protected] and Senior Associate Kimberly Tracey at [email\u00a0protected].\nThis blog was published on July 31, 2024, and due to the circumstances, there are frequent changes.

        "text": "Young Black voters might be swing voters now\nBefore President Joe Biden exited the presidential race on July 21, pollsters had noticed a consistent trend: Black voters were less solidly in the Democratic camp than in recent elections, including 2020. The Republican Party took notice: During the Republican National Convention, speakers like Rep. John James and Madeline Brame made special efforts to appeal to this key constituency.\n\nBlack voters are at least 10 percent of the population in several of the states most likely to decide the 2024 election \u2014 from Pennsylvania to Michigan to Florida. They also loom large in Georgia and North Carolina, states that have been close in the recent past. So even small changes in Black Americans' support for Democrats could take key states off the table.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris's candidacy has the potential to win back Black voters who shifted away from Democrats when Biden was the nominee. But who exactly are these potential new Black swing voters? That's a hard question to answer, in part because polls are rarely optimized to target a demographic that is diverse and larger than the entire population of Canada. By comparing high-quality polls from 2008 to 2024, though, we can see that age has emerged as a major factor in Black voters' support for Democrats \u2014 with younger Black voters no longer as solidly in Democrats' camp.\n\nHow much Black support had Biden lost?\n\nIt's unsurprising that the first Black president, Barack Obama, won more than 90 percent of Black voters during his own reelection bid in 2012 and enjoyed strong Black turnout, too. So, to get a baseline of Black voters' support for a white Democrat before former President Donald Trump came on the scene, we've got to look back to the 2008 primaries, when then-Sen. Hillary Clinton was one of the front-runners for the Democratic nomination.\n\nThat spring, before the nomination was set, the polling firm Knowledge Networks used population-based methods \u2014 surveying respondents online after recruiting them offline \u2014 to conduct a panel survey for the National Annenberg Election Survey. With a sample size of 9,888 in its spring 2008 wave alone, this survey had a large sample (962) of Black respondents. Overall, 75 percent of Black adults said they would vote for Clinton in a hypothetical general election matchup with then-Sen. John McCain, who got only 8 percent among Black adults. That's a 67-percentage-point gap.\n\nIn early 2024, however, the numbers looked quite different. Political scientist Gall Sigler and I partnered with NORC in February and March of this year to conduct a survey of the 2024 election that included 834 Black adults, and we found Biden led among these respondents by a smaller margin of 61 percent to 20 percent \u2014 a gap of only 41 points. (That wasn't far off a March/April YouGov poll of 2,004 Black or African American respondents conducted as part of the National Black Voter Project, which found Biden up 62 percent to 15 percent.) To be sure, that was still a massive pro-Democratic lean. But it was less than Democrats have enjoyed in the recent past.\n\nYounger Black Americans may now be swing voters\n\nWhat changed between 2008 and 2024? A look at Black support by age reveals the answer. As you can see in the chart below, in 2008, Black support for Clinton and McCain was reasonably consistent across age groups. Clinton's support was between 67 and 84 percent among Black Americans across all age categories.\n\nBut by 2024, a clear age gap had opened up among Black Americans, at least when thinking about a Biden-Trump matchup. Older Black voters remained overwhelmingly Democratic: For example, Black respondents aged 65-74 supported Biden by 70 points. But as you can see in the next chart, younger Black voters favored Biden by much smaller margins. In fact, Black voters between 25 and 34 gave just about equal support to Biden and Trump.\n\nWhy were younger Black Americans less supportive of Biden?\n\nOf course, it's possible that the key factor wasn't age itself, but rather something correlated with age, like propensity to turn out to vote. Back in April, using the same data set, I found that Trump performed much better \u2014 and Biden much worse \u2014 among Black voters who turned out less frequently. Biden's margin over Trump was 81 points among Black voters who voted in 2018, 2020 and 2022, while it was only 10 points among those who voted in none of those three elections.\n\nYounger voters tend to turn out less consistently, so maybe Biden's underperformance with young voters was really a weakness with infrequent voters. But vote history wasn't the whole story. When we fit a linear regression model to account for the relationship between prior turnout and voter preference simultaneously, age-based differences in voter preference among Black voters were reduced but not eliminated.\n\nAnother factor could have been Black voters' personal experiences with politics. In theory, Black voters who were young adults during the civil-rights era might be especially loyal to the Democratic Party because of the party's role in passing landmark legislation like the 1965 Voting Rights Act when they were most impressionable. But if that were true, we might expect to see a discontinuity for people in their late 70s, since someone who is 77 today was 18 in 1965. Instead, the actual trend by age groups looked more like a straight line, suggesting that other processes were at work.\n\nIndeed, there are other factors that also vary with age and might explain the age gap we saw. Thirty years ago, political scientist Michael Dawson published the book \"Behind the Mule,\" which argued that Black voters are an unusually cohesive voting bloc because of something called \"linked fate.\" To an important extent, Dawson wrote, Black Americans see their own opportunities as tethered to those of the Black community, so they vote overwhelmingly for the party they see as best for that community.\n\nIn the early 2024 survey, we measured this idea partly by asking Black respondents, \"Do you think what happens generally to Black people in this country will have something to do with what happens in your life, or not?\" Overall, our respondents tended to agree, with 75 percent saying what happens generally to Black people has \"a lot\" or \"some\" to do with their own life. But there was an age gap here too, albeit a more modest one: Black respondents aged 55-64 reported the highest sense of linked fate (79 percent), while those who were 18-24 reported the lowest (60 percent). It's plausible, then, that weaker perceptions of linked fate among younger Black voters helps explain the age gap in presidential support.\n\nBut let's be precise about the magnitude of the relationship. As respondents shifted from the lowest sense of linked fate (\"not at all\") to the highest (\"a lot\"), their support for Biden increased by about 0.11 on a 0-1 scale, according to a linear regression model. So linked fate was a part of the explanation, but it was not the whole story either. Even when we accounted for linked fate in statistical models, the age gap remained meaningful.*\n\nWhat this means for the fall campaign\n\nFor years, Democratic campaigns have devoted a lot of time and energy specifically to mobilizing Black voters. That will surely also be the case this year since, even if the Biden-level performance holds, Democrats will still benefit from high Black turnout \u2014 but some quick math shows us that those benefits may be dampened compared to prior years.\n\nIf Black voters as a whole cast more than 90 percent of their ballots for the Democrats, turning out 100 new Black voters will result in a net gain of 80 Democratic votes \u2014 that's assuming, though, a very high margin of Democratic victory among Black voters, and that the Black voters who only vote occasionally have the same levels of support as those who vote consistently. But if Black voters who wouldn't have otherwise voted are only with the Democrats by a margin of, say, 47 percent to 29 percent, turning out 100 new Black voters produces just 18 votes for Democrats on average. So if Democrats are losing the support of younger Black voters or less engaged Black voters, they may find that their get-out-the-vote efforts don't bear the same fruit as in past years.\n\nSophia Leung and Gall Sigler contributed research.\n\nFootnotes\n\n*In these regression models, we also saw that women were about 0.07 points (on the same 0-1 scale) more pro-Biden and that neither income nor education was a strong predictor of Black respondents' presidential preference.",

        "text": "What Expert Who Predicted 9 US Polls Correctly Said On Trump vs Harris\nA historian who has correctly predicted the result of nine US elections has now weighed in on the Donald Trump vs Kamala Harris fight.\n\nAllan Lichtman, often dubbed the \"Nostradamus of US presidential elections\", makes his predictions based on his \"13 keys to the White House\".\n\nThe method consists of 13 true or false questions, and if six or more keys go against the incumbent party, the 77-year-old American University historian predicts their defeat. If fewer than six went against it, it would win.\n\nThe keys assess various factors, including economic performance, social stability, and incumbent charisma. Through careful analysis spanning historical data since former US president Abraham Lincoln's era, Lichtman has crafted a predictive model that transcends conventional methods used by traditional psephologists.\n\nAllan Lichtman's \"13 Keys To The White House\"\n\nFrom Ronald Reagan's re-election triumph amid economic recession to Bill Clinton's victory against George HW Bush, Allan Lichtman has correctly predicted crucial poll contests in the US.\n\nThe 13 keys to the White House as designed by him are as follows:\n\nParty Mandate: Post-midterm elections, the incumbent party secures more US House of Representatives seats than in the previous midterms.\n\nNomination Contest: There's no significant challenge to the incumbent party's nomination.\n\nIncumbency: The sitting president represents the incumbent party.\n\nThird-party Factor: There's no noteworthy third-party or independent campaign.\n\nShort-term Economic Stability: The economy doesn't face recession during the election period.\n\nLong-term Economic Growth: Real per capita economic growth equals or surpasses the average growth of the preceding two terms.\n\nPolicy Shift: The incumbent administration enacts major alterations in national policy.\n\nSocial Stability: There's no prolonged social unrest throughout the term.\n\nScandal-Free: The incumbent administration remains free from major scandals.\n\nForeign/Military Mishaps: No significant failures occur in foreign or military affairs under the incumbent administration.\n\nForeign/Military Triumphs: The incumbent administration achieves significant successes in foreign or military matters.\n\nIncumbent Charm: The incumbent party's candidate possesses charisma or enjoys national hero status.\n\nChallenger Appeal: The opposing party's candidate lacks charisma or national hero status.\n\nDonald Trump Or Kamala Harris, Who Will Win US Polls?\n\nAllan Lichtman currently favours US Vice-President and Democrat Kamala Harris over her Republican rival Donald Trump. He told News Nation that he believes \"a lot would have to go wrong for Harris to lose.\"\n\nDemocrats, with Harris being the likely nominee after Joe Biden quit the reelection race, currently hold six of the 13 keys, according to his prediction. These include a primary contest, short-term economy, long-term economy, policy change, no scandal, and no challenger charisma.\n\n\"Right now, Democrats have lost three keys\" by switching to Harris, he told News Nation.\n\nHe said Democrats lost the \"party mandate\" key due to big losses in the 2022 mid-term elections. He also said Harris has lost the \"charisma\" and \"incumbency\" keys.\n\nI plan to make my official prediction in August after the Democratic convention.\n\nSee my assessment below below on the 13 Keys Tracker on where The Keys stand NOW. Please listen to our LIVE show on 7\u201325\u201324, linked in the comments below, where we detail every Key. pic.twitter.com/pJpkpa3SzW \u2014 Allan Lichtman (@AllanLichtman) July 26, 2024\n\nUnder his prediction model, Democrats, however, would have to lose three more keys in order for him to predict a Harris loss. But he says that's not likely to happen.\n\nHe has said that he plans to make his official prediction for the 2024 White House race after the Democratic convention in August.",

        "text": "Does Kim Jong Un Really \u2018Not Care\u2019 About the US Election?\nIn his speech accepting the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, former U.S. President Donald Trump flaunted his supposedly solid personal ties with Kim Jong Un and suggested the North Korean leader probably wanted him back in the White House, saying, \u201cI think he misses me.\u201d A few days later, however, the state-run Korean Central News Agency of North Korea delivered a stinging rebuke to Trump, saying, \u201cNo matter what administration takes office in the U.S., the political climate, which is confused by the infighting of the two parties, does not change and, accordingly, we do not care about this.\u201d\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth considering if Kim honestly \u201cdoes not care\u201d about the upcoming U.S. presidential election. I would argue that he does, and quite significantly, depending on who takes the helm in the White House. For Kim Jong Un, the next five years could be a period of profound uncertainty, with potential outcomes ranging from the worst-case scenario to a situation ripe for negotiations.\n\nThe worst-case scenario for Kim would be a victory by Vice President Kamala Harris, who has been endorsed by incumbent President Joe Biden as his successor as the Democratic presidential candidate. Harris\u2019 approach to North Korea is anticipated to continue to mirror Biden\u2019s. The Biden administration has primarily focused on pressuring the international community to enforce sanctions against North Korea, blocking illicit funds that Pyongyang could use for weapons of mass destruction, and highlighting human rights abuses under Kim\u2019s rule. With close bilateral and trilateral cooperation with allies South Korea and Japan, strengthening deterrence against North Korea has been a critical focus of Biden\u2019s North Korea policy. Harris\u2019 past comments on North Korea also suggest that she would continue this policy, which would significantly impact Kim\u2019s regime.\n\nFor Kim, a Harris administration would raise various concerns inside and outside North Korea. First, the constant updates to sanctions on North Korea, which the Biden administration has been eagerly leading, are one of the central obstacles to economic development. While the Bank of Korea recently reported that North Korea\u2019s GDP rose 3.1 percent in 2023 due to eased COVID-19 restrictions and favorable weather conditions, assessments still suggest that this economic rebound would likely be temporary.\n\nIf Harris becomes president, the trend of ever-tighter economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. against North Korea will be firmly maintained, thereby reducing the number of options available to Kim Jong Un by further restricting trade, limiting foreign exchange earnings, and isolating financial institutions. In a worst-case scenario, economic suffering could make it difficult for Kim to maintain his regime.\n\nThe weakening royal status of North Korea\u2019s ruling family, especially among young, tech-savvy North Koreans, is also one of the significant political challenges faced by Kim Jong Un. Many North Korean defectors report growing negative evaluations of Kim, increased dissatisfaction with Kim\u2019s hereditary succession, and rising antipathy toward the \u201cBaekdu bloodline\u201d on which the legitimacy of the Kim dynasty is based. The Kim family\u2019s divine presence has diminished significantly since Kim Jong Un came to power.\n\nThe influx of information into North Korea, such as South Korean drama and K-pop, has exposed North Koreans, especially young people, to alternative perspectives, economic disparities, and global culture \u2013 despite the Kim regime criminalizing such exchanges. The Biden administration\u2019s effort to increase access of North Koreans to outside information, which Harris would continue, would keep threatening the state propaganda by broadening awareness of North Koreans and opening minds to reality \u2013 including the reality of human rights violations in North Korea, which is aiming to maintain the power of the royal family, not aiming for the prosperity of North Korean citizens.\n\nDiplomatically, strengthening the trilateral security cooperation of the U.S., South Korea, and Japan, an effort that will be maintained if Harris becomes president, is not good news for Kim, either. North Korea recently achieved a diplomatic accomplishment through the Russia-North Korea pact thanks to the intensified \u201cnew cold war\u201d tensions. Some see this as evidence that the increasing trilateral partnership between the U.S., South Korea, and Japan has backfired. However, Kim knows the Russia-North Korea alliance is not as strong as the bilateral alliance between South Korea and the United States. Kim also recognizes that North Korea\u2019s partnership with China, which considers Pyongyang an oddity, if not an outright burden, is not much different from Russia\u2019s.\n\nThe South Korea-Japan-U.S. trilateral, which Harris will maintain or strengthen if she is elected this November, will keep strengthening deterrence against North Korean aggression, increasing regional security cooperation, and presenting a unified front in negotiations. This will limit Kim\u2019s international influence and legitimacy, constraining North Korea\u2019s diplomatic maneuverability.\n\nCompared to Harris, Trump would be the lesser of two evils for Kim Jong Un. Trump may try to reduce the number of U.S. troops stationed in South Korea, thinking that the U.S. troops are not needed on the peninsula. That is what Kim also wants. Additionally, Trump\u2019s volatility could cause a rift in the South Korea-U.S. alliance, which could be disconcerting for the Yoon Suk-yeol administration, which has consistently pursued a North Korean policy based on pressure. Beyond that, a second Trump administration might damage the broad framework of cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region, including the South Korea-Japan-U.S. trilateral, established by the Biden administration, which would be to Kim\u2019s advantage.\n\nThe previous Trump administration\u2019s policy toward North Korea was \u201cfinal, fully verified denuclearization (FFVD),\u201d the same policy other U.S. leaders have maintained, albeit with different terminology. However, Trump\u2019s caprice suggests this is not set in stone, as he showed during his recent acceptance speech. His comment, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to get along with somebody that has a lot of nuclear weapons or otherwise,\u201d suggests that Trump might treat Kim as the leader of a nuclear state.\n\nIn addition, Trump previously proved willing to neglect North Korean human rights issues \u2013 which Pyongyang doesn\u2019t want the international community to stir up \u2013 during his nuclear negotiations with Kim. Overall, if Trump is elected, this would buy time for Kim to deal with the economic, political, and diplomatic issues faced by North Korea.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that Kim Jong Un experienced the breakdown of the Hanoi summit as a humiliating diplomatic failure. A Trump victory, and the possibility of a repeat summit, is unlikely to be an enjoyable alternative for Kim.\n\nAlthough Kim Jong Un said he \u201cdoesn\u2019t care\u201d about the upcoming U.S. presidential election, he might secretly be hoping for Trump to win. Kim must have many worries as he watches the U.S. presidential election turnaround with Harris taking the Democratic candidacy. However, we can expect Kim to ultimately reaffirm his commitment to nurturing a \u201cself-reliant\u201d North Korea that no longer must suffer being dragged around by the great powers. There is no doubt that this commitment will result in Kim\u2019s actions to accelerate the advancement of nuclear weapons.",

        "text": "2024 Iranian presidential election\nEarly presidential elections in Iran were held on 28 June and 5 July 2024[1] following the death of incumbent president Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash on 19 May.[2]\n\nFour candidates contested the first round of the election, in which Masoud Pezeshkian won 44%, Saeed Jalili won 40%, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf won 14% and Mostafa Pourmohammadi won less than 1% of the vote. Pezeshkian was the only reformist candidate on the ballot.[3] As no candidate won a majority in the first round, a run off vote was held on 5 July between Jalili and Pezeshkian,[4] which the latter won with 53.7% of the vote. On 6 July 2024, the Ministry of Interior declared Pezeshkian the winner of the election,[5] with Jalili conceding defeat shortly thereafter.[6]\n\nWith a 39.93% turnout, the first round of the election saw the lowest participation for a presidential election in the Islamic Republic's history.[7] The turnout improved in the second round to 49.68%. Pezeshkian was seated as president after the ballot certification process was completed. His inauguration was held on 28 July.\n\nBackground [ edit ]\n\nOn 19 May 2024, after Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi inaugurated a hydroelectric complex at the Giz Galasi Reservoir near the Iran-Azerbaijan border, together with the President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev, Raisi departed from the site in a helicopter.[8] The helicopter carrying Raisi and seven other passengers and crew[9] crashed at approximately 13:30 IRST (UTC+03:30) near the village of Uzi in Varzaqan County in East Azerbaijan province.[10][11] Later that day, the wreckage of the helicopter was located,[12] with everyone on board found dead. This led to First Vice President Mohammad Mokhber becoming the acting president according to Article 131 of the Constitution.[13]\n\nElectoral system [ edit ]\n\nThe president of Iran is usually elected every four years by a \"direct vote of the people\", as set out by Article 114 of the Iranian Constitution.[13] The upcoming presidential election was scheduled to take place on or before 18 June 2025, but was held earlier due to the death of the president. Under Iran's political system, the President is the country's highest directly elected official, the chief of the executive branch, and the second most important position after that of the Supreme Leader.[14] The minimum voting age is 18.\n\nAccording to the Islamic Republic of Iran's constitution, any Iranian citizen who believes in Shia Islam, is loyal to the Constitution, the ideology of Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist and the Islamic Republic can participate in the election as a presidential candidate. The Election Monitoring Agency (EMA), managed by the Guardian Council, vets registered candidates and selects a handful to run in the election.[15]\n\nThe Guardian Council does not publicly announce the reason for rejections of particular candidates, although those reasons are privately explained to each candidate. Women are not constitutionally restricted from running, but all who have registered as candidates have been disqualified by the Guardian Council.[16][17] The council has officially denied rejecting a woman's candidacy because of her gender.[18]\n\nCandidates approved by the Guardian Council are put to a public vote. The winner is the candidate who receives a majority (50% plus one) of votes. If no candidate receives enough votes, a run-off election is held between the two candidates with the most votes the following Friday.[19] Iranians who vote during the election receive a stamp that indicates so on their birth certificates.[20]\n\nAccording to the constitution, once the result is known, the Supreme Leader must sign the decree of the elected president, and if he refuses to sign, the elected president will not assume the presidency. As of 2024, Supreme Leaders have always signed the decree of the elected president.[21][22] After that, the elected president must recite and sign an oath in a session of the Islamic Consultative Assembly, in the presence of the members of the Guardian Council and the head of the Supreme Court.[19]\n\nFor this election, more than 61 million citizens were eligible to vote, with about 18 million of them between 18 and 30 years old.[23] Voters were required to present identity booklets, passports or smart Iranian identity cards [24] The Ministry of Intelligence warned that presidential nominees were under constant monitoring.[25]\n\nOverseas voting [ edit ]\n\nVoting for overseas Iranians was held in 344 locations worldwide.[26][27] In Australia, polling was canceled in Brisbane and Sydney due to protests by the Iranian diaspora.[28] Opponents of the Iranian government, who wanted a boycott of the election, criticized the Biden administration for allowing the installation of voting stations in the United States.[29] Saudi Arabia[30] and Canada refused to grant Iran permission to install overseas ballot boxes,[31] though the decision was later reversed in Saudi Arabia.[32] Voting stations for Canadian voters were instead placed on the US-Canada border.[33]\n\nFollowing the announcement of Raisi's death on 20 May, authorities announced that voting would be held on 28 June.[1] Registration of candidates began on 30 May and ran until 3 June,[34] while campaigning lasted from 12 June until 27 June.[1]\n\nThe registration to run for the presidency started on 30 May and ended on 3 June. A total of 80 people, including four women, filed their candidacies for president.[35] Most candidates were considered as conservatives or ultra conservatives.[36] The final list of candidates was released by the Guardian Council on 9 June.[37] Per Article 99 of the Constitution, those rejected by the council are not allowed to protest the rejection.[13][38]\n\nApplied [ edit ]\n\nRejected [ edit ]\n\nA total of 74 aspirants had their candidacies rejected by the Guardian Council.[37] These included all four women who applied to run in the election.[56] The applications of least 30 candidacies were rejected on 30 May for failure to meet the \"basic conditions for qualification\".[57] Former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was the most notable to be disqualified by the Guardian Council, having been disqualified previously in 2021.[58]\n\nApproved [ edit ]\n\nSix candidates were allowed by the Guardian Council to run for president, namely Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, Saeed Jalili, Masoud Pezeshkian, Mostafa Pourmohammadi, Amirhossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi and Alireza Zakani.[37] On 26 June, Hashemi withdrew his candidacy and called on other candidates to follow \"so that the front of the revolution will be strengthened\". He was followed on 27 June by Zakani, who did so citing the need to \"block the formation of a third administration\" of former President Hassan Rouhani.[59] Both candidates, as well as Ghalibaf, subsequently endorsed Jalili in the second round.[60]\n\nCampaign platforms [ edit ]\n\nIn a speech on 3 June, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei told candidates not to attack each other and expressed his preference for a \"revolutionary president\".[64]\n\nThe authorities gave 20GB of free internet data for use on domestic messengers and Telewebion for 30 days to mobile phones to promote information regarding the election.[65] US-funded Radio Farda anticipated the total cost of the election to be more than US$357 million.[66]\n\nSaeed Jalili [ edit ]\n\nSaeed Jalili of the Front of Islamic Revolution Stability ran for president for the fourth time. He is the Supreme Leader's personal representative to the Supreme National Security Council and was formerly its Secretary, during which he was involved in the Iran nuclear negotiations.[67] Jalili was involved in governmental activities for the decade leading into the election.[68] He is backed by the Islamic Society of Students.[69] Jalili opposed negotiations with the West and the ratification of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).[70] In addition, Jalili supported the completion of an additional one million housing units.[71] Jalili opposed importing cars from overseas while Ghalibaf supported the import of cars.[72] Jalili promised three days of free vacation to government tourist residences for every citizen per year.[73]\n\nMasoud Pezeshkian [ edit ]\n\nOf the six candidates confirmed by the Guardian Council, Masoud Pezeshkian was regarded to be the only one representing moderates and reformists.[37] He was backed by Nedaye Iranian, the National Trust Party, Moderation and Development Party, Coalition of Reformist Women's Parties,[74][75][76] as well as former President Mohammad Khatami, former foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif[77] and the Assembly of the Forces of Imam's Line.[78] Pezeshkian's campaign slogan is \"Living without Shamefulness\".[79][80] He campaigned against the Guidance patrol's 2024 Nour program[81] and criticized Iranian laws on the wearing of the hijab.[82]\n\nIn his campaign speech, Pezeshkian said that he could not do anything for political prisoners as the power to release them does not belong to the president.[83] He told students not to insult Khamenei and that he had \"assimilated into the Supreme leader\".[84][85] His campaign staff used the song Baraye written by imprisoned singer Shervin Hajipour.[86] Pezeshkian also supported the banning of Afghan immigrants.[87]\n\nMohammad Bagher Ghalibaf [ edit ]\n\nGhalibaf promised to reduce the number of Afghan immigrants[88] and build a wall along Iran's borders with Afghanistan and Pakistan.[89] He expressed his support for strengthening the Axis of Resistance.[90] Ghalibaf promised better pay to health workers in order to stop emigration.[91] He said that he is open to closer relations with the United States and negotiating a new nuclear deal to alleviate Iran of its economic woes.[92]\n\nMostafa Pourmohammadi [ edit ]\n\nMostafa Pourmohammadi pledged an end to internet censorship[93] and supports nuclear negotiations but from a position of power.[94] He criticized Iranian military support for the Russian invasion of Ukraine due to what he called a lack of reciprocal benefits from Russia.[96]\n\nAlireza Zakani [ edit ]\n\nAlireza Zakani pledged to give away 120 tons of free meat every day.[97] He promised free health care for women and seniors and cash payments to the poor.\n\nDebates [ edit ]\n\nFirst round [ edit ]\n\nIRIB exclusively held and broadcast the presidential debates.[98][99] The questions to be asked in the debates were shared with all candidates beforehand.[100] The IRIB and the Election Office warned candidates against ruining the country's public image.[101][102] Documentaries will be also produced by IRIB for nominees.[103] The government also banned displaying images of candidates with Ali Khamenei and his predecessor as Supreme Leader, Ruhollah Khomeini.[104]\n\nThe candidates were asked during the first debate on issues such as inflation, the government's budget deficit, housing and corruption. All candidates pledged to have sanctions against Iran lifted, strengthen the rial and introduce reforms.[77] In the debate, Ghalibaf made several false claims on the economy, regarding energy waste in the country, national GDP and productivity rate.[105] Journalist Vahid Ashtari alleged that Ghalibaf falsely claimed about never having sued any journalist.[106] Ashtari was arrested on 20 June after posting luggage records of Ghalibaf's daughter, who travelled to Turkey.[107] Zakani falsely said that there were no hijab police deployed in the Tehran Metro and that he had not opposed imported COVID-19 vaccines.[108][109] Pourmohammedi claimed that IRIB TV2's news program 20:30 censored and manipulated a video he sent them.[110]\n\nDuring the 20 June debates, while discussing culture Pezeshkian's advisor Mohammed Fazeli threw his microphone and left the debate after getting into an argument with one of the hosts.[111] Economic issues were again discussed during the debate, as well as fuel subsidies and education.[112] In the third debate Hashemi promised to make an area in beaches for women to ride jet skis and do water sports,[113] while Pourmohammedi promised to decriminalize not wearing a hijab and stop violent responses by police and Basij.[114] Jalili criticized media attention to Mahsa Amini's death rather than the deaths of thousands of women in Gaza.[115] Ghalibaf claimed Iran's National Information Network has progressed 75%, which Factnameh [fa] said was \"unverifiable\".[116]\n\nIn the fourth debate Pourmohammadi called Jalili a traitor for sabotaging the FATF ratification and Ahmadinejad's Crescent petroleum deal,[117] which Jalili denied and said the Crescent agreement was flawed.[118] Hashemi criticized Hassan Rouhani and the reformists for warmongering in Afghanistan and praised Ebrahim Raisi for making peace and not letting Israel advance.[119] Pourmohammadi called the 1988 executions of Iranian political prisoners a \"project of difficult times of the government\" and that \"only People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran members who were fighting against the people were executed.\"[120]\n\nIn the fifth debate Hashemi promised to eliminate twelve months conscription for males.[121] Hashemi denied that Internet censorship in Iran exists, while Pezeshkian defended the 2019 Internet blackout in Iran.[122] Pourmohammadi pledged to bring transparency to the Tehran Stock Exchange.[123] Ghalibaf blamed Debsh government corruption on inequity.[124] During a debate on women, a representative of Jalili blamed women for being assaulted for not wearing a hijab.[125] Jalili himself told an interviewer that they did not understand the \"strategic depth\" of the hijab laws.[89] IRIB censored Pezeshkian's talk where he supported Mahsa Amini.[126]\n\nDebate list No Date and time Viewership 1 17 June [ 127 ] 26\u201327% [ 128 ] 2 20 June 3 21 June 4 24 June 5 25 June\n\nSecond round [ edit ]\n\nDuring a two-hour televised debate on IRIB on 1 July, Pezeshkian criticized Jalili over his lack of managerial experience, his stance on nuclear negotiations and his pledge to achieve an economic growth rate of 8% while in office, adding that authorities should be allowed to \"execute\" Jalili if his target was not met. Jalili accused Pezeshkian of having no plans to manage the country and instead lead it to a \"backward position\". Both candidates pledged to address issues involving the poor, workers, women, ethnic groups and religious minorities, as well as improve internet services. They also called for an investigation into the low turnout in the first round.[129] Pezeshkian called a situation in Iran a deadlock and said that no government will grow in a cage. He again criticized Jalili for his shadow state.[130]\n\nDuring the final debate on 2 July, Pezeshkian pledged to revive a nuclear agreement with foreign powers, while Jalili called on the US to honor its commitments on par \"with the commitments we fulfilled.\" Both candidates pledged to improve the economy, provide energy subsidies to the poor and facilitate the importation of cars while supporting domestic automobile makers.[131] Jalili made several misleading claims over the economy that sought to criticize the Rouhani administration and praise that of Raisi's.[132]\n\nCriticism [ edit ]\n\nThe Guardian Council denied allegations that they had rigged the election.[133] Abdolhamid Ismaeelzahi, the Sunni Friday Imam of Sistan and Baluchistan, criticized the system for not allowing women and religious minority candidates and closing down Sunni mosques and questioned the presidency's powers.[134][135][136] Four Sunni clerics were arrested in Urmia for criticizing the election.[137] Overseas monarchist opposition figures and groups such as Reza Pahlavi, the former crown prince of Iran, and the re-formed Iran-Novin Party called the election a circus.[138][139] United Against Nuclear Iran, an anti-Iran lobby group in the US, claimed that IRGC Baqiatallah HQ was engineering the election.[140] The National Front boycotted the election.[141]\n\nAlthough doing so is criminalized,[142] the Iranian Complainant Mothers,[143] Faezeh Hashemi Rafsanjani (the daughter of former president Akbar Rafsanjani),[144] Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi,[145] imprisoned activist Abolfazl Ghadyani,[146] house-arrested former prime minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi and his wife Zahra Rahnavard[147] and the Coalition for a Secular Democratic Republic in Iran [fa][148] have called for the boycotting of the election. Various reformist political prisoners like Mostafa Tajzadeh refused to support participating. The hashtag #ElectionCircus became prominent topics among Iranians on social media,[149] as well as the hashtag \"traitorous minority\", referring to calls against voting for either Pezeshkian or Jalili in the second round and calling anyone who does so a \"traitor\".[150]\n\nIn the first round, a majority of voters abstained from voting, resulting in a turnout of 39.93%, the lowest in the history of the Islamic Republic.[7] Turnout increased to 49.68% of votes in the runoff, possibly to prevent the election of Jalili.[151]\n\nMasoud Pezeshkian's victory sparked controversy over Saeed Jalili's self-styled shadow government. Critics challenged its legitimacy, funding, and transparency, arguing it disrupts governance and lacks a clear legal basis in Iran.[152]\n\nOpinion polling and forecasts [ edit ]\n\nThe Iranian Students Polling Agency predicted a turnout of 44.4%.[165][166] According to a poll conducted between 26 and 29 May 2024 by the Majlis Research Center, the voter turnout is predicted to be over 53%.[167] At the other end of the spectrum, polling conducted by the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance predicted just 30% participation in Tehran.[168] The Law Enforcement Command of the Islamic Republic of Iran warned people against sharing posts with fake polls, declaring it a crime.[169]\n\nOn 25 June, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called for \"high participation\" in the election, calling it \"the pride of the Islamic republic\".[170] He also warned against supporting candidates who believe that \"all ways to progress\" come from the United States.[171] Abbas Abdi, one of Iran's most influential reformist figures, predicted a maximum turnout of 60%, and a minimum of 55%.[172][173] The IRGC's Telegram channel conducted a poll in which Pezeshkian won 60% of the votes.[174]\n\nConduct [ edit ]\n\nPezeshkian voting in election\n\nVoting was held in nearly 60,000 voting stations and 90,000 \"voting points\" nationwide, while more than 300 voting stations were set up overseas. Polling in the first round was initially expected to run from 08:00 to 18:00,[175] but was extended at the last minute by the Interior Ministry to 20:00.[176] Polling was also extended until midnight on the second round of voting.[177]\n\nIncidents [ edit ]\n\nA video was posted during the campaign of a pro-Pezeshkian lawyer in Tabriz being beaten up in a desert by security forces. The Ministry of Justice opened an investigation.[178] Two members of the security forces were killed in a gun attack on a vehicle carrying election boxes in Sistan and Baluchistan.[179]\n\nIran's Internet Minister claimed that the country's fiber optic network was sabotaged on 28 June.[180] The interior ministry said it had arrested members of \"Project 1000 Squares\" which had planned to celebrate the election win of an undisclosed candidate.[181]\n\nOn 19 July, the governor[b] of Basht was arrested on charges of electoral misconduct.[182]\n\nResults [ edit ]\n\nOfficial results showed Pezeshkian and Jalili heading into a run-off scheduled on 5 July. Turnout in the first round was at 40 percent, the lowest for a presidential election in Iran since 1979,[183] while a total of 1,056,159 ballots were deemed as spoiled. The election also saw the first presidential run-off vote in Iran since 2005.[184]\n\nProvincial data (first round) [ edit ]\n\nVote composition of Iranian provinces along with participation rates [ 185 ] Province Masoud Pezeshkian (Votes) Saeed Jalili (Votes) Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf (Votes) Mostafa Pourmohammadi (Votes) Total Votes Participation Rate (%) Azarbaijan, East 1,067,088 244,076 57,432 7,276 1,402,108 44.11 Azarbaijan, West 806,620 145,619 58,011 4,960 1,010,210 40 Ardabil 382,647 72,878 36,377 2,676 504,602 48.5 Isfahan 428,098 868,431 139,979 16,524 1,454,032 41 Alborz 298,664 271,695 97,182 741 674,148 40.13 Ilam 119,843 44,706 30,852 1,704 208,187 47 Bushehr 144,138 167,217 40,850 2,618 374,345 46.5 Tehran 1,492,164 1,165,518 673,000 35,582 3,366,264 33 Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari 123,046 118,523 28,231 2,464 282,264 40 Khorasan, South 102,354 225,825 48,776 2,319 391,329 64 Khorasan, Razavi 661,493 1,212,033 429,458 19,330 2,415,696 49.39 Khorasan, North 115,697 115,672 57,638 1,026 320,407 45 Khuzestan 433,699 524,084 175,732 12,529 1,146,044 29.6 Zanjan 195,165 132,409 48,479 1,026 392,000 46.2 Semnan 73,287 137,081 34,759 2,302 262,284 49.2 Sistan and Baluchestan 443,226 199,976 87,788 4,368 735,358 40 Fars 532,947 634,294 132,848 10,292 1,310,381 36 Qazvin 156,853 166,852 51,811 3,358 395,753 42.8 Qom TBD TBD TBD TBD TBD 57 Kordestan TBD TBD TBD TBD TBD TBD Kerman 329,470 477,589 215,892 8,513 1,070,286 46 Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad 123,240 102,112 55,348 1,518 288,937 49.3 Golestan 275,366 205,974 81,095 5,023 591,201 41.16 Gilan 317,248 216,339 90,019 6,759 656,936 32.6 Lorestan 234,721 191,510 100,967 4,395 540,000 36 Mazandaran 406,485 448,308 132,151 9,629 1,043,570 42.3 Markazi 136,282 233,645 61,359 4,355 457,074 39.9 Hormozgan TBD TBD TBD TBD TBD TBD Hamedan 199,466 266,875 76,583 5,283 572,842 39 Yazd 165,696 213513 35,680 3,829 436,722 58.18\n\nMaps and graphs [ edit ]\n\nFirst Round [ edit ]\n\nWinner by province\n\nResult of the Iranian presidential election by province (in percentage)\n\nFirst round results by province.

In his concession statement, Jalili called for Pezeshkian to be respected. Pezeshkian is expected to assume the presidency within 30 days of the election, after he resigns from his seat in the Islamic Consultative Assembly and gains the formal approval of Khamenei.[186] In his speech in the Mausoleum of Ruhollah Khomeini, Pezeshkian thanked Khamenei for his support.[187] Khamenei praised the turnout despite what he called a campaign \"by the enemies of the Iranian nation to induce despair and a feeling of hopelessness\" and called on Pezeshkian to \"set his vision on high, bright horizons.\"[188]\n\nSenior Khamenei advisor Kamal Kharazi stated that the election would not affect Iranian foreign policy as it is controlled by the Strategic Council for Foreign Relations [fa].[189]\n\nIn his first post victory op-ed Pezeshkian called the 25 year cooperation between China and Iran a milestone and commended Iran-Russia detente.[190]\n\nOn 28 July, Pezeshkian received Khamenei's official endorsement to hold office as president. Pezeshkian also appointed as his first vice president Mohammad Reza Aref, a reformist politician who had previously served in the same position under Mohammad Khatami.[191]\n\nReactions [ edit ]\n\nDomestic [ edit ]\n\nKhamenei downplayed the low turnout in the first round, saying that it did not indicate opposition to the political system,[192] but ordered an investigation into its causes.[193] Former minister Ata'ollah Mohajerani criticized the administration of President Mokhber for failing to fulfill its mandate and campaigning instead for Jalili.[194] Mokhber has denied this.[195] The newspaper Kayhan published an editorial saying that the government will not give in to blackmail by election boycotters.[196] The reformist newspapers Sazandegi and Hammihan urged voters to participate in the election through their editorials.[197]\n\nFormer MP Mahmoud Sadeghi said that the Islamic Development Organization paid clerics to campaign for Jalili.[198] Commanding general of the IRGC, Hossein Salami called the election \"today's jihad\".[199][200] The Alliance for Democracy and Freedom in Iran's Hamed Esmaeilion, Reza Pahlavi and Masih Alinejad hailed the historically low turnout as a victory against the regime.[201]\n\nInternational [ edit ]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nNotes [ edit ]\n\n^ This poll took the percentages of the candidates among those who already had a preference.

        "text": "Lula says he will recognize Venezuela's election results\nThe tension in the country was addressed in a call with Joe Biden\n\nOn Tuesday (Jul. 30), Brazil's President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva announced that he will recognize the results of Venezuela's election held on Sunday (28). \u201cI will certainly acknowledge it once the victory is confirmed,\u201d he stated in an interview with TV Centro Am\u00e9rica.\n\nLula noted that Venezuelan authorities need to present the election minutes to resolve the impasse between the opposition and the government. \u201cDisputes are normal. How are you going to resolve this dispute? Present the minutes. If the minutes reveal discrepancies between the opposition and the government, the opposition can file an appeal and wait for the courts to handle it. We will then have to follow the court's decision,\u201d the president said.\n\nHe described the situation in the neighboring country as normal. \u201cI'm convinced that it\u2019s a standard, orderly process. People who disagree should have the right to express their views and challenge the results, while the government has the right to defend its position,\u201d Lula added.\n\nVenezuela's National Electoral Council (CNE) has yet to release the official minutes to validate the election results, which reportedly gave Maduro a victory with 51.21 percent of the votes compared to 44 percent for Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, according to CNE.\n\nPart of the opposition, along with some countries and organs like the Organization of American States (OAS), are questioning the fairness of the election and demanding the release of the minutes for a proper audit of the votes. In response, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's government accuses certain opposition figures and foreign nations of inciting an alleged coup d'\u00e9tat against the electoral results.\n\nConversation with Biden\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon (30), Lula and US President Joe Biden discussed the situation in Venezuela on the phone following the presidential elections on Sunday (29). Both leaders emphasized the importance of publishing the electoral records.\n\nIn a statement, the White House said President Biden thanked Lula for his regional leadership regarding the Venezuela situation. The two leaders also agreed on the urgent need for Venezuelan electoral authorities to release comprehensive, transparent, and detailed electoral data from polling stations.\n\n\u201cThe two leaders agreed that the outcome of the Venezuelan elections is a critical moment for democracy in the hemisphere and committed to staying closely coordinated on the issue,\u201d the statement read.",

You won\u2019t have to do it anymore. \u2026 You got to get out and vote. In four years, you don\u2019t have to vote again. We\u2019ll have it fixed so good you\u2019re not going to have to vote.\n\nDemocrats pounced on this as evidence of Trump\u2019s dictatorial ambitions. But not all conservative Christians were thrilled about it, either.\n\nDavid Lane, who leads an organisation dedicated to getting Christian leaders elected, fretted that Trump\u2019s comments could discourage Christians from voting in the future.\n\n\u201cEvangelicals in 2028, 2032, and 2036 must raise their civics game to a new level if America is to return to the Judeo-Christian heritage and Biblical-based culture laid out by the founders\u201d, Lane told the Washington Post.\n\nWas Trump really promising dictatorship? Or claiming there would be no need for Christians to vote in future elections? Or was he just repeating a joke he made a week earlier, based on his (wildly inaccurate) belief that conservative Christians are reluctant voters?\n\nEven jokes can be revealing, especially when it comes to the relationship between Trump and his supporters. Trump was not saying he would end elections, but he was being coyly apocalyptic about what Christians could expect from this one.",

        "text": "Assessing the Results of Venezuela\u2019s Presidential Election\nAntony J. Blinken, Secretary of State\n\nAugust 1, 2024\n\nThe United States applauds the Venezuelan people for their participation in the July 28 presidential election despite significant challenges. At least 12 million Venezuelans peacefully went to the polls and exercised one of the most powerful rights given to people in any democracy: the right to vote. Unfortunately, the processing of those votes and the announcement of results by the Maduro-controlled National Electoral Council (CNE) were deeply flawed, yielding an announced outcome that does not represent the will of the Venezuelan people.\n\nThe CNE\u2019s rapid declaration of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro as the winner of the presidential election came with no supporting evidence. The CNE still has not published disaggregated data or any of the vote tally sheets, despite repeated calls from Venezuelans and the international community to do so. As the independent Carter Center\u2019s observation mission reported, the CNE\u2019s failure to provide the precinct-level official results, as well as irregularities throughout the process, have stripped the CNE\u2019s announced outcome of any credibility.\n\nMeanwhile, the democratic opposition has published more than 80 percent of the tally sheets received directly from polling stations throughout Venezuela. Those tally sheets indicate that Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia received the most votes in this election by an insurmountable margin. Independent observers have corroborated these facts, and this outcome was also supported by election day exit polls and quick counts. In the days since the election, we have consulted widely with partners and allies around the world, and while countries have taken different approaches in responding, none have concluded that Nicol\u00e1s Maduro received the most votes this election.\n\nGiven the overwhelming evidence, it is clear to the United States and, most importantly, to the Venezuelan people that Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia won the most votes in Venezuela\u2019s July 28 presidential election.\n\nIn addition, the United States rejects Maduro\u2019s unsubstantiated allegations against opposition leaders. Maduro and his representatives\u2019 threats to arrest opposition leaders, including Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez and Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, are an undemocratic attempt to repress political participation and retain power. The safety and security of the democratic opposition leaders and members must be protected. All Venezuelans arrested while peacefully exercising their right to participate in the electoral process or demand transparency in the tabulation and announcement of results should be released immediately. Law enforcement and security forces should not become an instrument of political violence used against citizens exercising their democratic rights.\n\nWe congratulate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia on his successful campaign. Now is the time for the Venezuelan parties to begin discussions on a respectful, peaceful transition in accordance with Venezuelan electoral law and the wishes of the Venezuelan people. We fully support the process of re-establishing democratic norms in Venezuela and stand ready to consider ways to bolster it jointly with our international partners.",

        "text": "Q&A: Professor William Howell Discusses What's at Stake in the 2024 Presidential Election\nProfessor William Howell\n\nThe United States presidential election of 2024 is in full swing, with former President Donald Trump and Senator J. D. Vance of Ohio accepting the Republican nomination and incumbent President Joe Biden declining the Democratic nomination in favor of his Vice President, Kamala Harris.\n\nIn a campaign with this many twists and turns, with inflation, immigration, and the future of democracy as topics on the campaign trail, we sat down with William Howell, the Sydney Stein Professor in American Politics and the director of the Center for Effective Government at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy, to gain some insight.\n\nHow would you characterize what's at stake for the country? Is it really the most important election of our lifetime, as people on both sides seem to feel?\n\nThe stakes, of course, are enormous. A great deal hangs in the balance in this election: the health and wellbeing of our democracy, all manner of policy issues, and, not least, the future of the Democratic and Republican parties.\n\nThat said, I\u2019m reticent to talk about any single election being \u201cthe most important\u201d in our history or lifetimes. Looking back, we are plainly living in a politics defined by the beginning of the Iraq War, something that would have been inconceivable had Al Gore prevailed in the 2000 election. It also hard to imagine a Trump presidency without Obama\u2019s election in 2008 and reelection in 2012. Every one of these elections mattered a great deal, both for what they immediately ushered in, and for what they meant for future elections.\n\nIs 2024 the most important election of our lifetime? Sure\u2013as was the last one, and the one before that.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the withdrawal of incumbent President Joe Biden from the race before the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Were Democrats\u2019 concerns about Biden\u2019s ability to win overblown?\n\nNo. It wasn't some spasm of misguided anxiety that led the Democratic Party to impulsively boot their front-runner from the race; it was done with real cause. President Biden\u2019s debate performance in June spoke to lingering, deep, and abiding concerns about his age and his ability to perform the duties of office.\n\nPresident Biden\u2019s debate performance tapped into concerns that were both widely felt and very real. Much of the presidency is about communication and performing in public. During his term in office, Biden was shielded from much public exposure. When he did speak without the safety of a teleprompter, many of his supporters grimaced along. And this is what happened in the last four years. Never mind what's going to happen for the next.\n\nBiden clearly wanted to see this campaign through to the end, but he had no choice but to stand down. What we\u2019ve just witnessed has been a party coming to terms with a very real problem and doing something in the final hour to rectify it. All kinds of pressure were applied so that, in the end, Biden's hand was forced.\n\nWould Biden have ended up winning in November? Probably not, but we don't really know. Will Kamala Harris necessarily win by virtue of this shift? We\u2019ll have to wait and see. What we can say with certainty now is that the Democratic Party undertook this change with real cause.\n\nShould President Biden have any hope at meaningful legislation or reform in the remaining time he has in office?\n\nGiven the partisan composition of Congress and Biden\u2019s waning influence, it\u2019s hard to imagine that he'll be able to accomplish any great feats legislatively. But on three fronts, we may see continued evidence of this sitting president\u2019s influence.\n\nOne is an acceleration of regulatory activity that's handled through the administrative state. There is regularly a burst of unilateral activity in the final months of presidents when they're in office, and I think we can expect to see that now.\n\nWe can also expect to see Biden working behind the scenes trying to shore up the international coalition in support of the war in Ukraine, and to shape foreign policy as it relates to Israel. Those are two hotspots around the globe that the United States has been heavily involved in, and where Biden doesn't need, at least for the next six months, lots of congressional support in order to influence ground-level operations.\n\nThe third area is one where, admittedly, I\u2019d like to see change. A lament I have about the Biden presidency is, frankly, the inattention paid to institutional reforms in service of a stronger democracy. There was a brief moment early in his term where Biden thought about filibuster reform and another brief moment when he assembled a group of lawyers to think about judicial reform. Since then, very little has happened. But that may be changing. Biden recently announced a set of proposed reforms to the judicial branch, including 18-year term limits for Supreme Court justices. I\u2019d like to see him to turn to those themes more, if only to set a democracy reform agenda for the intermediate future.\n\nAs it pertains to shoring up our democratic systems, Democrats have consistently called former President Trump a threat to democracy. Are those claims legitimate?\n\nYes, they are legitimate.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: Democrats are certainly trying to push this narrative so that they can win in November. They aren't neutral arbiters in a serious-minded evaluation of the stakes of the upcoming election. They are looking for advantages in order to win it.\n\nThat being said, the future of democracy in important respects does hang in the balance, particularly when you think about the Trump administration's plans to retrench the administrative state. Project 2025 is an extraordinary, coordinated effort on the part of conservatives to finally lay waste to the administrative state, which they see as an abomination in the constitutional order. And they plan to do so by massively, massively increasing the number of political appointees to the federal bureaucracy. It's the administrative state that interprets and implements statutes, that sets the government in motion. So when Trump promises to drain the swamp, and when members of his party call for the wholesale and indiscriminate firing of civil servants, these aren't idle threats: They come from a long history of conservative skepticism and opposition to the administrative state. They see this as their moment to finally kneecap the federal bureaucracy.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all: When you see the damage Trump has done to democratic norms and practices, and his taste for autocratic power, the stakes of the upcoming election appear in stark relief. When you just listen to Trump, take him at his word, it\u2019s plainly apparent that we have real reasons to be concerned about the health and wellbeing of our democracy.\n\nWill Democrats save our democracy, once and for all? No. Will Harris shore up our institutions, should she be elected? Probably not. But the threat from former President Trump is real. We should take it very seriously.\n\nWhat about Trump\u2019s legal travails? What do you make of the judicial system\u2019s ability to handle the cases against him?\n\nSay what you will about the general importance of the federal judiciary. The idea that the third branch of government is going to serve as a robust guard against demagoguery and the entreaties of a strongman president is just foolhardy.\n\nOn legal grounds, many saw the classified documents case as being the strongest among the bunch brought against Trump. It\u2019s astonishing that a district-level Trump appointee with an extreme interpretation of the structure of government saw fit to just dismiss it. It's outrageous, and it comes on the heel of all kinds of delays. Meanwhile, the Georgia election interference case founders, and the January 6 case brought by the Justice Department is wrapped up in the Supreme Court\u2019s newfound discovery of presidential immunity. In the slow pace of its deliberations and the contents of its rulings, the federal judiciary is all but insisting that it won\u2019t check the unilateral actions of a strongman president\u2014not reliably, not consistently, not urgently.\n\nFormer President Trump has chosen United States Senator J. D. Vance of Ohio as his running mate, and Vice President Harris is currently considering her options. How much does a vice presidential selection matter, and what should Harris consider as she\u2019s picking her VP?\n\nWith respect to electoral returns, vice presidential selections don\u2019t matter an awful lot. There\u2019s some evidence, though certainly not overwhelming, that vice presidents may be able to deliver their home state. But in this era of acute partisan polarization, the effect is likely to be even smaller than what the historical record might suggest.\n\nWhat matters is twofold: (1) the selection of a vice president provides insight into the trajectory of a party and the kind of administration the president intends to hold; and (2) the selected individual may him or herself become president, either as a result of a vacancy in office or because they\u2019re the chosen standard-bearer in the aftermath of a presidential term of office. More than anything Kamala Harris recently accomplished, it was her position as Vice President that did the most to deliver her the Democratic Party\u2019s nomination for president this year.\n\nOr let\u2019s take J. D. Vance. His selection speaks to Trump's total unwillingness to countenance any disagreement within his ranks, just as it speaks to his ambition that the populist wing of the Republican Party carry forward in the years ahead. There's real meaning in that selection. Trump is not a young man; he\u2019ll be 82 at the end of his term if he is elected again\u2013just as old as Biden is now. If something were to happen to him\u2013and I certainly hope that it does not\u2013then we\u2019d promptly have as president someone whose entire experience in elected office amounted to two years spent in the Senate.\n\nMeanwhile, Harris is trying to select her own VP. It's not an accident that she's looking at a bunch of governors, many of whom are political moderates who will appeal to independents and that sliver of the electorate that hasn't made up its mind between voting D or voting R. But when making her pick, she surely is paying to issues that go beyond electoral considerations. Presidents regularly select governing partners who can fill out their own experience. Many people thought that President Barack Obama's selection of Biden in 2008 was informed in no small part by Biden's foreign policy experience. Harris may do the same.\n\nAnd lastly, I expect that Harris will draw lessons from her own experience working with Biden since 2020. This relationship, surely, will inform her selection of a nominee, much like Biden\u2019s experience as vice president under Obama informed his choice four years ago.\n\nIf there are debates between Harris and Trump, what would you like to see them discuss?\n\nI would like to see clear proposals about how we might modernize and fortify the institutions that govern our democracy. When thinking about the future of democracy, it's not enough to speak in generalities. We need to talk and argue about specifics. Following Biden\u2019s recommendation, should we have 18-year term limits for Supreme Court justices? Should we keep the Electoral College? What, precisely, about the administration of elections might be improved?\n\nIf we're going to make actual progress in shoring up our democracy, we need to speak about tangible reforms. I'd like to hear what these candidates have to say about them.\n\nDoes it seem like we\u2019re in unchartered territory, with all of the news in the past several weeks?\n\nIt sure does.\n\nHistorically, there have been instances when an incumbent president withdrew during an election year, as in 1968. There have been previous assassination attempts on presidents, former presidents, and candidates. There have been plenty of elections when uncertainty about a party\u2019s nomination ran right through a brokered convention.\n\nWhat we've been observing over the course of the last month, though, is altogether exceptional: an incumbent president who secured all the delegates needed for the nomination but who withdrew from the campaign just weeks before the convention for reasons that have nothing to do with a political scandal or with a falling out with his party on the basis of policy issues\u2013and a vice president emerging within hours as the new candidate. On split screen, meanwhile, you have Trump not just wielding, but flaunting his total control over the Republican Party, which was only enhanced through this recent assassination attempt; and then him selecting, if not a facsimile, then certainly a loyal servant as his vice president.\n\nAll of this has happened in a matter of weeks. Have we seen some of the elements of this drama before? Sure. Have we seen them strung together in the way that we have this last month? Not even close.",

        "text": "Trump and Vance\u2019s misogyny and cynical identity politics mean Australians can\u2019t \u2018just chill\u2019 about the US election | Paul Daley\nThe forthcoming election is one of the most important to me since I first cast a ballot more than four decades ago. And yet this time \u2013 while I\u2019ve never felt more invested in an election\u2019s outcome \u2013 I won\u2019t have a vote.\n\nI\u2019m not talking about the next federal poll in Australia \u2013 the one that\u2019s most likely to be held early next year. No, I\u2019m referring to the United States presidential election in November, the result of which will reverberate with profound global consequences and \u2013 therefore \u2013 with significant personal others as well.\n\nYes, I\u2019ve heard our ambassador to the US, Kevin Rudd, praise Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cdiscipline\u2019\u2019 and tell people to \u201cjust chill\u2019\u2019 because \u201cwe\u2019re not going over some chasm\u2019\u2019 if the 45th president \u2013 a narcissist and misogynist with a chaotic vision (or hallucination; it\u2019s hard to tell) \u2013 is elected the 47th. And I\u2019ve heard the rote, condescending nonsense \u2013 equally aimed to assuage the fears of the decent and progressive \u2013 from Australian politicians: that the US-Australia relationship exists between two \u201cgreat democracies\u2019\u2019 and that it is effectively immaterial who the next president ... blah blah.\n\nBut I did also hear another, rather more convincing, non-ambassadorial version of Rudd say Trump was \u201cnuts\u201d (mild criticism, really, given the array of damning material in the ether about the Republican presidential nominee). Just as it resonated when the Republican veep nominee, JD Vance, called his running mate \u201ccultural heroin\u2019\u2019 and \u201cAmerica\u2019s Hitler\u201d. In fairness, that was in the not-so-distant past (according to him, another country) when Vance had a book to sell and before he decided that he\u2019d like to follow Trump all the way into the Oval Office.\n\nIndeed, there seems to be a bottomless well of character assessments (\u201cmorally reprehensible human being\u2019\u2019 \u2013 again, hard to argue!) Vance gave Trump in the unforgiving continent that is the past.\n\nMy obsession with what happens next in the US \u2013 and my sense of powerlessness to change it \u2013 is manifesting in personally unprecedented engagement with US news, commentary media and polls. This fixation is doubtless related to advancing middle age, legacy and a future (without me in it) that will still be inhabited by my children and grandchildren.\n\nAmerica is the most geopolitically and militarily influential of countries. It is also the west\u2019s most culturally and socially impactful. It\u2019s why I fear for my \u2013 and everyone else\u2019s \u2013 descendants (not least women and girls like my daughters and granddaughters) in a world whose the two potentially most-powerful men \u2013 Trump and Vance \u2013 are also so apparently misogynistic, hateful and narcissistic.\n\nThe litany of Trump\u2019s actual (and verbal) offences against women is notorious. This seems too often forgotten or overlooked by admirers the world over \u2013 especially among sections of the political class here in Australia \u2013 to the file marked \u201ccharacter\u2019\u2019 and made, therefore, somehow irrelevant.\n\nBut such character traits are as highly relevant globally, as Trump attacks the reproductive (and human) rights of American women and deploys vicious slurs against women who threaten \u2013 or call out \u2013 their misogyny. The latest to come to light seems to be Vance\u2019s weaponisation of parenthood, in 2021 labelling senior Democrats \u2013 including now presidential nominee Kamala Harris and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u2013 \u201cchildless cat ladies\u2019\u2019.\n\nTrump\u2019s latest attack on Kamala Harris \u2013 saying she had \u201cturned black\u2019\u2019, an unsustainably false challenge to her racial identity \u2013 makes him less worthy. Just as this will give succour to racists the world over, it also enables politicians, including here, who would weaponise racial identity for cynical gain.\n\nWhile Trump and Vance, like all populists, are perilously short on constructive policy and plans and optimism for the future, their prescriptive visions for social design when it comes to families and how they reckon they should look are coming into very sharp \u2013 and alarming \u2013 focus.\n\nIf this is all starting to sound, well, somewhat dystopic, that\u2019s because it is. The most alarming thing for me, a world away, about the re-emergence of Trump (twice impeached, 34 felony convictions) and the upwardly-managing Vance is the global licence they give others to ape, voice and enact their misogyny. If it\u2019s good enough for the leader of the free world and his apprentice ...\n\nWith Trump\u2019s cozying up to despots and dictators and his own dictatorial fantasies (having denied the last election result then incited a 6 January lynch mob to attack the capitol in pursuit of his then vice-president, Mike Pence, who certified the legitimate election of Joe Biden), Trump is the embodiment of autocracy. The danger he poses potentially extends far and away beyond the US, and with a deputy like Vance (who would not stand up to him the way Pence did), Trump\u2019s power would be unfettered. So, \u201cresponsible\u2019\u2019? No. Don\u2019t just chill. Be vigilant.\n\nI could go on about how Trump\u2019s general playbook and cynical identity politics has already influenced and enabled elements of Australian leadership (as it has elsewhere in the world) from the tenor of civic debate to renewables (\u201cdrill baby drill\u2019\u2019), emissions targets and a range of social issues. But it is the Trump/Vance attitude \u2013 their words and actions regarding women, gender, families, race and society \u2013 that makes the forthcoming presidential election the most consequential for the rest of my life.\n\nIt\u2019s true we don\u2019t have a vote down here. But as many have said, maybe we should. Meanwhile, some of us can continue to hope and watch carefully.",

        "text": "Most U.S. vice presidents in recent decades have sought the presidency, but relatively few have won\nVice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris arrives at campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, on July 22, 2024. (Erin Schaff/Pool/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has launched her bid for the 2024 Democratic presidential nomination. While most U.S. vice presidents in recent decades have sought the presidency, relatively few of them have won.\n\nHow we did this Kamala Harris\u2019 announcement that she would run for president made us wonder how many vice presidents in the United States have ultimately gone on to become president. We conducted this analysis to look at past vice presidents who ran for the top job and how often they won. For this analysis, we consulted historical records from the White House Historical Association, the U.S. House and Senate, presidential libraries and the University of Virginia\u2019s Miller Center, as well as news reports.\n\nOverall, 29 of the 49 people who have served as vice president since the country\u2019s founding have gone on to formally seek a party\u2019s presidential nomination, either immediately after leaving the vice presidency or in the years that followed. Ten of these 29 vice presidents \u2013 about a third \u2013 have been elected to the nation\u2019s top political office.\n\nUntil the 1930s, it was less common for the vice president to seek the presidency. Many returned to a lower elected office or retired after serving as vice president. Still, earlier well-known presidents including John Adams, Thomas Jefferson and Theodore Roosevelt had previously served as vice president.\n\nAmong modern vice presidents, running for the top job has become more of the norm. Starting with Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s first term in 1933, 15 of 18 vice presidents have launched presidential campaigns of their own after serving in the deputy role. But only five of these 15 emerged victorious: Democrats Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson and Joe Biden, and Republicans Richard Nixon and George H.W. Bush.\n\nTwo of these five modern vice presidents-turned-presidents initially took office after incumbent presidents died and they subsequently ran for election at the top of the ticket:\n\nHarry Truman had been vice president for less than three months when FDR died in office in 1945, elevating Truman to the Oval Office. Truman went on to be elected president in 1948.\n\n\n\n\n\nhad been vice president for less than three months when FDR died in office in 1945, elevating Truman to the Oval Office. Truman went on to be elected president in 1948. Lyndon Johnson took over after President John F. Kennedy\u2019s 1963 assassination. Johnson was elected for a full, four-year term in 1964.\n\nTwo others weren\u2019t elected to the top office until years after their vice presidencies ended:\n\nIn 1960, Richard Nixon \u2013 who was serving as Dwight Eisenhower\u2019s second-in-command \u2013 lost the presidency to Kennedy in a close contest. He would run again, and win, in a 1968 match against then-Vice President Hubert Humphrey, a Democrat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2013 who was serving as Dwight Eisenhower\u2019s second-in-command \u2013 lost the presidency to Kennedy in a close contest. He would run again, and win, in a 1968 match against then-Vice President Hubert Humphrey, a Democrat. Joe Biden, former vice president to Barack Obama, decided not to seek the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016. He went on to run and win in 2020.\n\nThree modern vice presidents have won their party\u2019s nomination but lost the general election. In 1948, FDR\u2019s third-term vice president, Henry Wallace, was the Progressive Party nominee. Jimmy Carter\u2019s vice president, Walter Mondale, secured the 1984 Democratic nomination. And in 2000, Al Gore, Bill Clinton\u2019s second-in-command, was the Democratic nominee. Gore won the popular vote but lost in the Electoral College and conceded to George W.

        "text": "U.S. recognizes opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez as winner of Venezuelan presidential election\nThe U.S. government on Thursday recognized Venezuelan opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez as the winner of the South American country's presidential election, discrediting the results announced by electoral authorities who declared President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro the victor.\n\n\"Given the overwhelming evidence, it is clear to the United States and, most importantly, to the Venezuelan people that Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia won the most votes in Venezuela's July 28 presidential election,\" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.\n\nThe National Electoral Council declared Maduro the winner of Sunday's highly anticipated election, but the president's main challenger, Gonz\u00e1lez, and opposition leader Maria Corina Machado have said they obtained more than two-thirds of the tally sheets that each electronic voting machine printed after polls closed.\n\nOpposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez rides on top of a truck during a protest against the official results of the presidential elections that declare President Nicolas Maduro the winner in Caracas, Venezuela, on July 30, 2024, two days after. Pedro Rances Mattey/Anadolu via Getty Images\n\nThey said the release of the data on those tallies would prove Maduro lost.\n\nThe announcement from the U.S. government came amid diplomatic efforts to persuade Maduro to release vote tallies from the election and increasing calls for an independent review of the results, according to officials from Brazil and M\u00e9xico.\n\nGovernment officials from Brazil, Colombia and Mexico have been in constant communication with Maduro's administration to convince him that he must show the vote tally sheets from Sunday's election and allow impartial verification, a Brazilian government official told The Associated Press Thursday.\n\nThe officials have told Venezuela's government that showing the data is the only way to dispel any doubt in the results, said the Brazilian official, who asked not be identified because they are not authorized to publicly speak about the diplomatic efforts.\n\nA Mexican official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity for the same reason, confirmed that the three governments have been discussing the issue with Venezuela but did not provide details. Earlier, Mexico President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador said he planned to speak with President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva of Brazil and President Gustavo Petro of Colombia, and that his government believes it's important that the electoral tallies be made public.\n\nLater Thursday, the governments of Brazil, Colombia and Mexico issued a joint statement calling on Venezuela's electoral authorities \"to move forward expeditiously and publicly release\" detailed voting data, but they did not confirm any backroom diplomatic efforts to persuade Maduro's government to publish the vote tallies.\n\n\"The fundamental principle of popular sovereignty must be respected through impartial verification of the results,\" they said in the statement.\n\nVenezuelan President Nicolas Maduro during a press conference at Miraflores Palace in Caracas, Venezuela, on Wednesday, July 31, 2024. Gaby Oraa/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nOn Monday, after the National Electoral Council declared Maduro the winner of the election, thousands of opposition supporters took to the streets. The government said it arrested hundreds of protesters and Venezuela-based human rights organization Foro Penal said 11 people were killed. Dozens more were arrested the following day, including former a opposition candidate, Freddy Superlano.\n\nOpposition leader Machado \u2014 who was barred from running for president \u2014 and Gonz\u00e1lez addressed a huge rally of their supporters in the capital, Caracas, on Tuesday, but they have not been seen in public since. Later that day, the president of the National Assembly, Jorge Rodriguez, called for their arrest, calling them criminals and fascists.\n\nIn an op-ed published Thursday in the Wall Street Journal, Machado said she is \"hiding, fearing for my life, my freedom, and that of my fellow countrymen.\" She reasserted that the opposition has physical evidence that Maduro lost the election and urged the international community to intervene.\n\n\"We have voted Mr. Maduro out,\" she wrote. \"Now it is up to the international community to decide whether to tolerate a demonstrably illegitimate government.\"\n\nOpposition leader Maria Corina Machado and opposition presidential candidate Edmundo Gonzalez raise their hands together during a protest against the result of the presidential election on July 30, 2024 in Caracas, Venezuela Alfredo Lasry R/Getty Images\n\nGovernment repression over the years has pushed opposition leaders into exile. After the op-ed was published, Machado's team told the AP that she was \"sheltering.\" Machado later posted a video on social media calling on supporters to gather Saturday morning across the country.\n\nThe Gonz\u00e1lez campaign had no comment on the op-ed.\n\nOn Wednesday, Maduro asked Venezuela's highest court to conduct an audit of the election, but that request drew almost immediate criticism from foreign observers who said the court is too close to the government to produce an independent review.\n\nIt wasn't clear if Maduro's first concession to demands for more transparency was the result of the discussions with Brazil, Colombia and Mexico. Venezuela's president confirmed during a news conference on Wednesday that he had spoken with Petro about it.\n\nVenezuela's Supreme Tribunal of Justice is closely aligned with Maduro's government. The court's justices are proposed by federal officials and ratified by the National Assembly, which is dominated by Maduro sympathizers.\n\nOn Thursday, the court accepted Maduro's request for an audit and ordered him, Gonz\u00e1lez and the eight other candidates who participated in the presidential election to appear before the justices Friday.\n\nSupporters of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro take part in a rally in Caracas on July 31, 2024. JUAN BARRETO/AFP via Getty Images\n\nGonz\u00e1lez and Machado say they obtained more than two-thirds of the tally sheets printed from electronic voting machines after the polls closed. They said the release of the data on those tallies would prove Maduro lost.\n\nAsked why electoral authorities have not released detailed vote counts, Maduro said the National Electoral Council has come under attack, including cyber-attacks, without elaborating.\n\nThe presidents of Colombia and Brazil \u2014 both close allies of the Venezuelan government \u2014 have urged Maduro to release detailed vote counts.\n\nThe Brazilian official said the diplomatic efforts are only intended to promote dialogue among Venezuelan stakeholders to negotiate a solution to the disputed election. The official said this would include the release of voting data and allowing independent verification.\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador said Mexico hopes the will of Venezuela's people will be respected and that there's no violence. He added that Mexico expects \"that the evidence, the electoral results records, be presented.\"\n\nPressure has been building on the president since the election.\n\nThe National Electoral Council, which is loyal to Maduro's United Socialist Party of Venezuela, has yet to release any results broken down by voting machine, as it did in past elections. It did, however, report that Maduro received 5.1 million votes, versus more than 4.4 million for Gonz\u00e1lez. But Machado, the opposition leader, has said vote tallies show Gonz\u00e1lez received roughly 6.2 million votes compared with 2.7 million for Maduro.\n\nVenezuela has the world's largest proven crude reserves and once boasted Latin America's most advanced economy, but it entered into free fall after Maduro took the helm in 2013. Plummeting oil prices, widespread shortages and hyperinflation that soared past 130,000% led to social unrest and mass emigration.",

        "text": "US Democrats start voting to nominate Harris as presidential candidate\nU.S. Democrats began voting Thursday to nominate Vice President Kamala Harris as their 2024 presidential candidate to run against former Republican President Donald Trump in the November election for a new four-year term in the White House.\n\nNearly 4,000 Democratic activists and politicians sent in signatures supporting Harris at the start of a five-day electronic vote ahead of the party's four-day national convention from August 19 to 22 in Chicago.\n\nHarris is expected to name her vice presidential running mate in the coming days and then embark on a string of rallies through several political battleground states that both Harris and Trump need to win to claim the presidency.\n\nThe Democratic faithful voting to nominate Harris originally were picked in state-by-state party primary elections and caucuses earlier this year to vote for the reelection nomination of President Joe Biden.\n\nBut when the 81-year-old Biden ended his campaign last month after a stumbling debate against Trump in late June and endorsed Harris, 59, the party adherents quickly coalesced behind her candidacy. No other major opponent emerged to challenge her for the nomination.\n\nHarris won the support of 99% of the delegates who signed petitions in the party's nominating contest, the Democratic National Committee said in a statement, while no one else met the qualifying threshold of 300 signatures.\n\n\"Our delegates have an important responsibility \u2014 and opportunity \u2014 in the days ahead to cast their history-making ballots for Vice President Harris, ensuring that she will be on the ballot in every state this November,\" said Jaime Harrison, the national party chair.\n\n\"Our party has met this unprecedented moment with a transparent, democratic and orderly process to unite behind a nominee with a proven record who will lead us in the fight ahead,\" he said.\n\nHarris will become the first Black and South Asian woman to ever secure a major U.S. party's presidential nomination.\n\nWith the November 5 election less than 100 days away, polling across the U.S. and in key states shows Harris and Trump locked in a closely contested race.",

He blasted Venezuela\u2019s electoral council for conducting a deeply flawed election that clearly did not reflect the will of the voters.\n\nBlinken said it was \u201ctime for the Venezuelan parties to begin discussions on a respectful, peaceful transition in accordance with Venezuelan electoral law and the wishes of the Venezuelan people.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMaduro\u2019s electoral council refuses to release public voter polling tally sheets. Opponents say they collected 80% of the sheets which show Gonzalez winning two-thirds of the vote. Maduro was declared the winner with 51% of the vote.\n\nThe leaders of Mexico, Brazil and Colombia have called on Maduro to make all vote counts public. He claims, without providing evidence, that the council was hacked. More than 1,000 people, many who were protesting alleged election fraud, have been detained.\n\n",

        "text": "How the 2024 election will affect the automotive industry: Presidential candidate\u2019s potential impact\nThe outcome of the 2024 presidential election could significantly shape the industry\u2019s future, influencing everything from environmental regulations to trade policies and technological advancements. Here, we explore the potential implications of each presidential candidate on the automotive sector.\n\nDemocratic Candidate Kamala Harris\n\nKamala Harris, now the presumptive Democratic nominee, has a strong track record of supporting environmental initiatives and advancing technology in the automotive sector. Her agenda is expected to build on the foundation laid by the Biden administration, with an even more aggressive push toward sustainability and innovation.\n\nHarris has emphasized the importance of supporting electric vehicles (EV) production and adoption. Her administration would likely push for stricter fuel economy standards and offer substantial incentives for EV production. This includes expanding the nearly $1.1 billion in grants planned for General Motors (GM) and Stellantis to convert existing plants for EV and component production.\n\nMoreover, Harris\u2019s focus on infrastructure would see an increase in investments in nationwide EV charging networks. This effort aims to alleviate range anxiety and encourage more consumers to switch to electric vehicles. Tax credits and incentives for consumers purchasing EVs would likely be expanded, making them more financially accessible to the average American.\n\nHarris\u2019s policies also emphasize the need to support American workers in transitioning to green technologies. Initiatives to retrain workers from traditional automotive manufacturing sectors to new roles in EV production will be crucial in her plan to achieve a carbon-neutral economy by 2050. These measures would accelerate the shift towards sustainable transportation, positioning the U.S. as a global leader in the fight against climate change.\n\nRepublican Candidate Donald Trump\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is a vocal critic of stringent environmental regulations, often advocating for deregulation to boost economic growth. His first term saw significant efforts to roll back numerous ecological protections to reduce the regulatory burden on businesses and foster economic expansion. A Trump administration could roll back many of the current emission standards and fuel economy requirements. Trump has repeatedly vowed to repeal what he calls Biden\u2019s \u201cEV mandate,\u201d referring to a new EPA regulation limiting tailpipe pollution.\n\nTrump\u2019s approach to the automotive industry emphasizes the importance of bolstering domestic manufacturing. He has advocated for tariffs and trade policies to protect U.S. automakers from foreign competition. By imposing tariffs on imported vehicles and parts, Trump aims to encourage the production of cars within the United States, thereby creating jobs and supporting the domestic economy. However, these policies could also increase production costs for automakers, as they might have to pay more for imported components or shift their supply chains domestically.\n\nFurthermore, Trump\u2019s trade policies could exacerbate trade tensions with key automotive markets, such as China and the European Union. These tensions might result in retaliatory tariffs, affecting the export of American-made vehicles and parts. This complex trade environment could pose challenges for U.S. automakers, who rely on global supply chains and international markets for their products.\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s policies may provide short-term economic benefits for domestic manufacturers, they could also lead to higher production costs and strained international trade relationships. The potential rollback of environmental regulations might offer temporary relief for traditional automotive sectors but could hinder long-term innovation and the global shift toward sustainable transportation.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe 2024 presidential election presents a critical moment for the automotive industry. Each candidate brings a distinct vision that could accelerate the transition towards sustainable transportation or favor traditional manufacturing practices. As voters decide, the automotive sector must stay adaptable and prepared for potential policy shifts.",

        "text": "July 31, 2024, presidential campaign news\nDonald Trump participates in a question and answer session at the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) convention at the Hilton Hotel in Chicago, Illinois on July 31. Getty Images\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, drew gasps on Wednesday when he said at the National Association of Black Journalists convention that Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee, had suddenly adopted a Black identity.\n\nHarris\u2019 father is from Jamaica, her late mother from India. Trump claimed: \u201cI\u2019ve known her a long time, indirectly, not directly very much, and she was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn\u2019t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black. So I don\u2019t know, is she Indian, or is she Black?\u201d\n\nWhen one of the journalists who was interviewing Trump on stage tried to tell him that Harris had always identified as Black and had attended a historically Black university, Trump continued: \u201cI respect either one, but she obviously doesn\u2019t. Because she was Indian all the way, and then all of a sudden, she made a turn, and she went \u2013 she became a Black person. And I think somebody should look into that too.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s comments prompted immediate bipartisan criticism. Leaving aside the issue of the appropriateness of the remarks, his claims are just not true.\n\nFacts First: Trump\u2019s claims are false. Harris did not \u201call of a sudden\u201d begin identifying as Black. She has embraced and discussed her Black identity for decades, beginning long before she became a political candidate, while also honoring her South Asian heritage.\n\nHarris graduated in 1986 from Howard University, a historically Black institution where she was a member of a historically Black sorority. After that, she was elected president of the association of Black law students in her second year at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law, according to her 2019 memoir.\n\nPolitico reported in 2021 that, as a third-year student at the law school in 1989, Harris rose to speak against anti-Black racism at a campus demonstration prompted by the discovery of racist vandalism: \u201cFor Black students, she said, according to archives of the Hastings Law News, the cartoon was an example of \u2018what we deal with all the time.\u2019\u201d\n\nA profile of Harris in the publication AsianWeek in 2003, when she was running for San Francisco district attorney, was focused on her South Asian heritage. But it quoted Harris discussing her father as \u201ca Black man\u201d and saying, \u201cI grew up with a strong Indian culture, and I was raised in a Black community. All my friends were Black, and we got together and cooked Indian food and painted henna on our hands, and I never felt uncomfortable with my cultural background.\u201d\n\nRead more about why Trump\u2019s claim about Harris\u2019 was false and several other false statements he made at the conference here.",

        "text": "US presidential election: JD Vance's missteps\nRepublican vice presidential candidate US Senator JD Vance and his family welcome supporters to the Park Diner in Saint-Cloud, Minnesota, on July 28, 2024. STEPHEN MATUREN / AFP\n\nDistressed comments are proliferating in conservative ranks in tandem with the reappearance of excerpts from interviews embarrassing to JD Vance, Donald Trump's vice presidential nominee. Born into a poor, dysfunctional family, he became a perfect example of social success, experience on which he drew for his 2016 bestseller, Hillbilly Elegy. Until this point, the senator from Ohio had mainly been attacked by Democrats for his radical positions on abortion, whether refusing exceptions in extreme cases such as rape or incest or opposing a woman from his state being able to travel to another, more rights-conscious one to terminate a pregnancy.\n\nRead more Subscribers only J.D. Vance pushes his working-class roots in first speech as Trump's running mate\n\nAmerican voters have discovered that this position was part of a vision of society that pits citizens against each other depending on whether or not they have children. In a 2021 interview with controversial host Tucker Carlson, then on conservative Fox News, Vance mocked Democratic figures including Vice President Kamala Harris and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. He used a misogynist clich\u00e9 of \"childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives.\" He said they \"want to make the rest of the country miserable too\" and have no \"direct stake\" in the good of the nation, as they lack descendants.\n\nHarris has no children, but her husband, Doug Emhoff, has a boy and a girl from a first marriage. Buttigieg, who is openly gay, is raising adopted twins with his husband.\n\nSocial contempt\n\nVance's statement was no blunder. On another occasion, he asserted that \"almost always the people who are most deranged and most psychotic are people who don\u2019t have kids at home.\" In another clip, Vance, speaking with conservative pundit Charlie Kirk, argued for higher taxes for childless people. Vance has the \"remarkable ability to take a long-standing part of the tax code that enjoys broad bipartisan support and make it sound scary and unfair,\" lamented the conservative magazine National Review.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, which Vance regularly targets as too moderate, also took issue with him in an editorial on July 26. \"Conservatives used to believe in a neutral tax code that didn\u2019t play favorites, but Mr. Vance is suggesting the code should be used as a political and cultural weapon against people who don\u2019t share his values,\" wrote the business daily.\n\nIn the title of its editorial, the Wall Street Journal pointed to a sort of social contempt that it likened to that expressed by 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, when she compared Trump's voters to a \"basket of deplorables.\" She apologized without ever erasing the affront. Asked to take back his words, Vance pleaded humor, adding that he had nothing against cats, or dogs.",

        "text": "Could the gender divide decide the US presidential election?\nThe 2024 presidential election \"pits young men against young women,\" said The Wall Street Journal . Voters under 30 are increasingly divided along gender lines, with women favoring Democrats and men increasingly favoring Republicans. That gap isn't just about candidates: It extends to \"abortion, student-loan forgiveness and other issues\" of concern to young adults. Some of that might reflect different life experiences: A growing share of young women are achieving financial independence, \"while fewer young men are reaching that milestone compared with four decades ago.\"\n\nIt's not just young people. There's also a \"divorce divide\" in American politics, Daniel A. Cox said at the Survey Center on American Life . Recent polling shows that 56% of divorced men are voting for Donald Trump \u2014 his most devoted group of voters \u2014 compared to 42% of divorced women. That's a sign that as Americans \"spend more time uncoupled, they are more likely to develop a tribal approach to politics.\" And there are concerns the gender gap could ripple more broadly through American culture. \"Partisan polarization is bad for the nation,\" Elizabeth Grace Matthew said at The Hill, \"but partisan polarization that correlates ever more with sex is likely to prove even worse.\"\n\n\"The gender war is much weirder than it initially appears,\" Derek Thompson said at The Atlantic. It might appear that men are shifting right and women to the left, but \"it's not so simple.\" Millions of women will vote for Donald Trump this year, after all. But Republicans and Democrats are \"sharply divided by their cultural attitudes toward gender roles and the experience of being a man or woman in America.\" For example: One survey found that 61% of Democrats think women face discrimination, while only 19% of Republicans agree. The gap isn't about gender \u2014 it's about \"the role of gender, the meaning of gender, the definition of gender.\"\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Yes, women are usually more liberal than men, but the size of the gap \"just isn't all that big.\" \"The differences between women and men are not, in any way, the biggest differences we have in American politics,\" said the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee's Kathleen Dolan. Maybe that is changing for younger generations, but for now the \"narrative is galloping well ahead of the facts.\"\n\nWhat next?\n\nThe gap is an international phenomenon. \"In countries on every continent, an ideological gap has opened up between young men and women,\" John Burn-Murdoch said at the Financial Times. There are growing divides between \"increasingly conservative young men and progressive female contemporaries.\" That could shape politics around the world for decades to come, not just in the current U.S. election. \"The ideology gaps are only growing, and data shows that people's formative political experiences are hard to shake off.\"\n\nBack in the U.S., the gender gap seems to be widening with Kamala Harris' ascension to the top of the ticket, said NBC News. Recent polls show Harris with a 14- to 16-point lead over Trump among women voters, while Trump beats Harris by as much as 24 points among men. Bottom line: \"Trump's advantage among men seems larger than Harris' edge among women.\" That means the divide could be a \"significant factor\" in the 2024 race.",

Their \u201cforward-looking agenda\u201d promises to turn the U.S. into a manufacturing superpower, resurrect the American auto sector, and restore vital supply chains.\n\nThe platform also states that \u201cRepublicans will restore American manufacturing, creating jobs, wealth, and investment\u201d by protecting the American workforce from unfair foreign competition and unleashing energy production from all resources, including oil, natural gas, and nuclear power.\n\nHow will the U.S. outsourcing ban affect global markets?\n\nTrump\u2019s statement has broader implications worldwide. Outsourcing is projected to reach $75.89 trillion by 2027; however, such drastic changes in the U.S., the largest offshoring market, will likely affect the global economy.\n\nAbout 66% of U.S. companies outsource at least one business function, leading to around 300,000 U.S. jobs being contracted out every year. In addition, the U.S. generates the most revenue in the global business process outsourcing (BPO) industry, with a projected income of $146.30 billion in 2024.\n\nIf Trump wins the election and bans offshoring, it will severely affect service provider countries once businesses pull out. The top countries that U.S. companies outsource to include India, China, Mexico, Brazil, Poland, and the Philippines.\n\nAs the leading country for outsourcing, India\u2019s multibillion-dollar industry relies heavily on its clients in the U.S. While China takes most of the manufacturing jobs, the Philippines remains the BPO capital. Outsourcing to the Philippines covers 13% of the global market while contributing around $30 billion to the country\u2019s annual revenue.",

Joe Rogan predicts who could win 2024 presidential election, netizens say 'it's a terrifying thought\u2019\nJoe Rogan has predicted that Kamala Harris could win the presidential election this year. The controversial podcaster said he believes Harris might be able to knock off Donald Trump in November. Joe Rogan predicts who could win 2024 presidential election (Photo by Luke Hales / GETTY IMAGES NORTH AMERICA / Getty Images via AFP)(Getty Images via AFP)\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s gonna win,\u201d Rogan said on an episode of The Joe Rogan Experience on Tuesday, July 30. The episode featured cultural commentator Michael Malice.\n\nCountering Rogan, Malice said, \u201cNo, she\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nRogan later refined his answer, saying he believes Harris could win. \u201cI\u2019m not saying because I think she\u2019s going to, and I\u2019m not saying because I want her to,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just being honest.\u201d\n\nRogan said that his preference does not depend much on how likeable Harris is, but on how much Trump is not. \u201cI feel like we are in this very bizarre time where people are giving into the bulls\u2013t in a way that I never suspected people would before,\u201d Rogan said. \u201cThey just want no Trump, no matter what.\u201d\n\nRogan went on to say that if Michelle Obama or Hillary Clinton joined the race, even one of them could end up winning. He said that while Trump surviving an assassination attempt should have sealed the win for him, the incident has only been \u201cmemory holed.\u201d\n\n\u2018It's a terrifying thought\u2019\n\nX users weighed in on Rogan\u2019s comments, with one user commenting on the above video, \u201cI wouldn't be surprised if Kamala wins. Everyone is on her side. X is the only place where you can learn the truth about Harris.\u201d \u201cI will have to respectfully disagree with Joe. But he makes a good point and that's we can't get complacent,\u201d one user wrote, while another said, \u201cThe election is still a long way away and Kamala has to debate Trump and she can\u2019t dodge real interviews forever\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt's a terrifying thought,\u201d one user said, while another wrote, \u201cHe's right. We need more people to speak out about kamala. The rnc needs to invest in influencers to talk about Trump. She just might be dominating on social media.\u201d \u201cRogan is wrong on this one,\u201d one user wrote.\n\n\u201cRogan is right about Kamala\u2019s potential for winning. We\u2019re at the start of the most extensive propaganda campaign in American history. The regime couldn\u2019t entirely fake enthusiasm for Biden, but they can for Harris,\u201d one user wrote, while another said, \u201cI fear this too. The fake news media will continue to push her. And a lot of Americans don\u2019t do any homework sadly.\u201d \u201cThis prognosis is way too early in the game, and I bet the hangover is going to be rough for Kamala,\u201d one user wrote. \u201cJoe has a point but I don\u2019t see her winning,\u201d another user said.",

Kevin Lamarque | Reuters\n\nWhen it comes to the November election, there is one issue that is at the top of voters' wish lists: Social Security. Despite political division, most Americans \u2014 87% \u2014 want action to address Social Security's trust fund shortfall, according to the National Institute on Retirement Security. The group polled 1,208 individuals aged 25 and older. Meanwhile, 69% of Americans said a candidate's stance on Social Security will be a major factor in how they vote in the presidential election, according to Nationwide Retirement Institute. It polled 1,831 adults age 18 and up who \"currently receive or expect to receive Social Security.\" While experts mostly agree a fix is needed, they are divided on how that should happen \u2014 whether it be through tax increases, benefit cuts or a combination of both. The deadline to fix the programs will only grow more urgent during the next presidential administration. \"If something is going to happen before the eleventh hour, it is going to require presidential leadership,\" said Emerson Sprick, associate director of the Bipartisan Policy Center's Economic Policy Program. \"That's something we haven't seen on this issue for a very long time.\"\n\nProjected depletion dates are looming\n\nBiden can 'show leadership' before presidency ends\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden is flanked by family members as he speaks about the release of Americans detained in Russia during brief remarks at the White House in Washington, U.S., August 1, 2024. Nathan Howard | Reuters\n\nWhile the focus is on the presidential campaigns, President Joe Biden still has a window of opportunity to work to address Social Security and Medicare. \"Biden has a really fantastic opportunity, if he wants to get the ball rolling and show some leadership on the issue in the lame duck,\" Sprick said. Some Democrats have proposed raising taxes for the wealthy and increasing benefits. Meanwhile, a bipartisan group of lawmakers has proposed forming a commission to identify next steps. But those efforts like those have yet to prompt action, which would likely require compromises. \"The folks in Congress need leadership and a little bit of cover from the top of the ticket,\" Sprick said. Biden publicly vowed to protect Social Security and Medicare and \"make the wealthy pay their fair share\" during his March State of the Union address. \"We could extend the life of Medicare's Trust Fund permanently \u2014 without cutting benefits \u2014 if Congressional Republicans would get on board with the President's historic budget proposal to raise taxes on the wealthy,\" said White House spokesperson Robyn Patterson. \"The President's budget also clearly states his principles for strengthening Social Security,\" Patterson said. \"He looks forward to working with Congress to responsibly strengthen Social Security by ensuring that high-income individuals pay their fair share, without increasing taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 or cutting benefits.\"\n\nTrump wants to eliminate some Social Security taxes\n\nRepublican presidential nominee and former U.S. President Donald Trump holds a campaign rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, U.S., July 31, 2024. Elizabeth Frantz | Reuters\n\nFormer President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social on Thursday, in all capital letters, \"Seniors should not pay tax on Social Security!\" Experts say the post likely refers to the taxes Social Security beneficiaries may owe on their benefit income. The Trump campaign did not return a request for comment by press time. Exactly how much Social Security beneficiaries pay in taxes is based on their \"combined income,\" which includes adjusted gross income, nontaxable interest and half of their Social Security benefits. For individuals with $25,000 to $34,000 in combined income \u2014 or married couples who file jointly with between $32,000 and $44,000 \u2014 up to 50% of benefits are taxed. For individuals with more than $34,000 in combined income \u2014 or married couples with more than $44,000 \u2014 up to 85% of benefits may be taxable.\n\nwatch now\n\nThose thresholds are not adjusted for inflation. Consequently, as time passes and benefit income increases, more beneficiaries are liable for taxes on their benefits. Nixing those levies would allow beneficiaries to keep more of their benefit income. But it would also reduce revenues for both Social Security and Medicare by about $1.6 trillion to $1.8 trillion between fiscal years 2026 and 2035, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates. Like Biden, Trump has mostly promised not to cut Social Security. Yet in a March CNBC interview, Trump said he would consider cutting \"entitlements,\" which may refer to Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid. \"There is a lot you can do in terms of entitlements, in terms of cutting and in terms of also the theft and bad management of entitlements,\" Trump told CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\n\nHarris opposes benefit cuts\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris speaks at a campaign rally at the Georgia State Convocation Center on July 30, 2024 in Atlanta, Georgia.

Images published by Machado\u2019s party on social media show several walls covered in black spray paint.\n\nThe arrest comes as top officials, including Maduro himself, have threatened to arrest the opposition leader, who has gone into hiding as she seeks to rally Venezuelans to challenge last Sunday\u2019s election results.\n\nThe Biden administration has thrown its support firmly behind the opposition, recognizing last minute candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez as the victor, discrediting the official results of the vote proclaiming Maduro the winner.\n\nThe U.S. announcement late Thursday followed calls from multiple governments, including close allies of Maduro, for Venezuela\u2019s electoral authorities to release precinct-level vote counts, as it has done during previous elections.\n\nThe electoral body declared Maduro the winner Monday, but the main opposition coalition revealed hours later that it had collected copies of 80% of the country\u2019s 30,000 voting tallies and that they show Gonz\u00e1lez prevailed by a more than 2-to-1 margin.\n\n\u201cGiven the overwhelming evidence, it is clear to the United States and, most importantly, to the Venezuelan people that Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia won the most votes in Venezuela\u2019s July 28 presidential election,\u201d U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.\n\nMaduro responded with a quick admonishment: \u201cThe United States needs to keep its nose out of Venezuela!\u201d\n\nThe U.S. government announcement came amid a flurry of diplomatic efforts by Brazil, Colombia and Mexico to convince their fellow leftist to allow an impartial audit of the vote. On Thursday, the governments of the three countries issued a joint statement calling on Venezuela\u2019s electoral authorities \u201cto move forward expeditiously and publicly release\u201d detailed voting data.\n\nBut it\u2019s unclear what leverage the countries have over Maduro, who has shown little inkling to rethink his entrenched position.\n\nWhile no ally or anyone in the crucial armed forces has yet to break with Maduro over the contested elections, he faces huge obstacles righting Venezuela\u2019s economy without the legitimacy that can only come from a credible election result.\n\nVenezuela sits atop world\u2019s largest proven crude reserves and once boasted Latin America\u2019s most advanced economy, but it entered into free fall marked by 130,000% hyperinflation and widespread shortages after Maduro took the helm in 2013. More than 7.7 million Venezuelans have left the country since 2014, the largest exodus in Latin America\u2019s recent history.\n\nU.S. oil sanctions have only deepened the misery and the Biden administration \u2014 which had been easing those restrictions \u2014 is now likely to ramp them up again unless Maduro backs down and agrees to some sort of transition.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s counting on being able to wait this out and people will get tired of demonstrating,\u201d said Cynthia Arnson, a distinguished fellow at the Wilson Center, a Washington think tank. \u201cThe problem is the country is in a death spiral and there\u2019s no chance the economy will be able to recover without the legitimacy that comes from a fair election.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, after the National Electoral Council declared Maduro the winner of the election, thousands of opposition supporters took to the streets. The government said it arrested hundreds of protesters and Venezuela-based human rights organization Foro Penal said 11 people were killed. Dozens more were arrested the following day, including a former opposition candidate, Freddy Superlano.\n\nMachado \u2014 who was barred from running for president \u2014 and Gonz\u00e1lez addressed a huge rally of their supporters in the capital, Caracas, on Tuesday, but they have not been seen in public since. Later that day, the president of the National Assembly, Jorge Rodriguez, called for their arrest, describing them as criminals and fascists.\n\nOn Wednesday, Maduro asked Venezuela\u2019s highest court to conduct an audit of the election, but that request drew almost immediate criticism from foreign observers who said the court, which like most institutions is controlled by the government, lacks the independence to perform a credible review.\n\nAsked why electoral authorities have not released detailed vote counts, Maduro said the National Electoral Council has come under attack, including cyberattacks, without elaborating.\n\nIn an op-ed published Thursday in the Wall Street Journal, Machado said she is \u201chiding, fearing for my life, my freedom, and that of my fellow countrymen.\u201d She reasserted that the opposition has physical evidence that Maduro lost the election and urged the international community to intervene.\n\n\u201cWe have voted Mr. Maduro out,\u201d she wrote. \u201cNow it is up to the international community to decide whether to tolerate a demonstrably illegitimate government.\u201d\n\nMachado later posted a video on social media calling on supporters to gather Saturday across the country.\n\n___\n\nGoodman reported from Medellin, Colombia.

        "text": "Electoral Aftermath in Mexico and the North American Era\nIn the early hours of June 3, 2024, Mexico witnessed a pivotal moment in its political history. After 61% of Mexicans cast their votes, Claudia Sheinbaum emerged as the clear victor of the presidential election, defeating her closest rival, X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez, by a two-to-one margin.\n\nIn her first speech as president-elect, Sheinbaum expressed gratitude to her competitors and emphasized her party's recent gains of absolute majorities in both houses. She embraced the responsibility of governing with a focus on freedom, honesty, anti-corruption, development, and well-being for all Mexicans. Notably, she highlighted the United States, pledging a relationship based on friendship, mutual respect, and equality. She also committed to defending Mexicans living across the border.\n\nFast forward two months, Sheinbaum\u2019s cabinet is mostly in place, providing a clearer view of her administration's trajectory and its implications for Mexico's bilateral relationship with the United States.\n\nAs Sheinbaum herself has stated, her presidency will serve as a continuation of the legacy left behind by her predecessor, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador (AMLO). This means a commitment to social policies involving cash transfers, raising the minimum wage, enhancing critical infrastructure, and completing major projects like the Mayan Train, Dos Bocas oil refinery, the Interoceanic Train, and two airports. Additionally, she plans to expand passenger rail services nationwide. These projects will operate under a very constrained budget, and aim to keep federal spending low.\n\nIn terms of new policies, a shift in energy policy is anticipated. Sheinbaum supports clean energy and recognizes the need for private investment in the sector. However, she maintains that state-owned companies will continue to dominate the electricity and oil markets. Using clean and green energy is a prerequisite for new investments as it is now fundamental for companies to reach their global sustainable development commitments towards 2030.\n\nOn the security front, Sheinbaum plans to bolster the recently established National Guard, improve coordination with local police, and invest in technology and intelligence; strengthening security is key in a context where more than 58% of companies in Mexico invest between 2 and 10% of their budgets to keep their operations safe. A significant judicial reform is expected in September -still under AMLO\u2019s ruling but with the recently elected legislative power- aiming to overhaul the Supreme Court and other judicial bodies through popular elections. The reform, as currently written, could disrupt the Mexican government\u2019s apparatus and significantly hinder the Mexican economic and democratic stability.\n\nIndustrial and investment policies will prioritize organized \u201cnearshoring,\u201d driving regional development by harnessing each state\u2019s unique strengths. Sheinbaum envisions \u201cWellness Poles\u201d across Mexico, which we believe is achievable only through a dynamic partnership with the private sector to invigorate strategic sectors like semiconductors, medical devices, electromobility, and agriculture. Additionally, investment enablers such as water, energy, and connectivity should be developed. Strengthening North American supply chains is the only way for both countries to counter China\u2019s economic dominance.\n\nUnderstanding the critical importance of U.S. relations, Sheinbaum aims to foster an equal and respectful partnership. The upcoming U.S. presidential election will test her diplomatic skills and political maturity. Ensuring the proper implementation of the USMCA is a priority, and former Foreign Affairs Minister, Marcelo Ebrard, now appointed Minister of Economy, will oversee this crucial task.\n\nSecurity collaboration between Mexico and the U.S. will need a strategic overhaul, focusing on shared objectives and efficient methods to achieve them. The new administration will seek stronger cooperation on development issues, particularly migration and its root causes. The border, a crucial point for trade, security, and migration, presents an opportunity for infrastructure and technological investments to address these issues separately and effectively.\n\nTwo crucial tests for the U.S.-Mexico relationship will come in 2026: the first review of the USMCA as well as the World Cup, to be hosted in cities across North America. It is a historic opportunity that will either showcase a well-organized, forward-thinking alliance or expose chaotic disarray. The region stands at a crossroads, but 2026 is an opportunity to strengthen collaboration and cooperation in North America to ensure regional prosperity.",

        "text": "Kamala Harris formally chosen as Democratic nominee\nKamala Harris formally chosen as Democratic nominee\n\nGetty Images\n\nUS Vice-President Kamala Harris has passed the threshold to clinch the Democratic presidential nomination in a vote of party delegates. Speaking by telephone, Ms Harris said she was \"honoured to be the presumptive nominee\" as the virtual roll call continues ahead of the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago later this month. Ms Harris is the first black woman and first South Asian woman to become the White House standard-bearer for a major US political party. If she defeats Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, in November she would be America's first female president.\n\nMore on the US election\n\nShe ran unopposed in the virtual roll call after President Joe Biden stepped aside last month and quickly endorsed her. Several potential rivals followed his lead. On Friday afternoon, Ms Harris formally became the nominee after securing the support of 2,350 delegates, the threshold required to earn the nomination. \"We believe in the promise of America and that\u2019s what this campaign is about,\" she said in brief remarks by phone as she crossed the benchmark. \"We are in this, we are on the road and it's not going to be easy, but we\u2019re going to get this done.\" In total, Democrats have said 3,923 delegates - or 99% of the participants - plan to vote for her. The rollcall began on Thursday and ends on Monday. Presidential and vice-presidential nominees are typically anointed at their party conventions, but the relatively late date of the 2024 DNC risks falling afoul of state ballot access laws. Ms Harris, 59, was born in Oakland, California, and is the first Democratic nominee in the party's nearly 200-year history to hail from a western state.\n\nShe rose through the ranks of state politics from San Francisco district attorney to California attorney general and then US senator. Before dropping out of the race, Mr Biden had easily won the Democratic primary. He did not face stiff opposition despite voter concerns about his age and had won backing from 99% of pledged DNC delegates. But the 81-year-old faced escalating pressure from within the party to withdraw after a poor June debate performance against Trump. The decision to hold a virtual nominating process ahead of the 19-22 August convention was made while Mr Biden was still the presumptive candidate. It came in response to rules for ballot access in the state of Ohio, which requires that candidates for the November ballot be formally selected 90 days before the election - or by 7 August. Republican leaders in the state had warned they would enforce the law and, though lawmakers eventually created an exemption as they have done in the past, Democrats said an early rollcall would pre-empt further risks of their candidates being excluded from the ballot. Delegates do not need to vote on the vice-presidential pick. Ms Harris is expected to name her running mate by Monday.",

In a statement Antony Blinken said it was clear Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, had won the most votes - despite incumbent president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro declaring a disputed victory. \"Given the overwhelming evidence, it is clear to the United States and, most importantly, to the Venezuelan people that Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia won the most votes in Venezuela's 28 July presidential election,\" Mr Blinken said. His intervention comes as the presidents of Brazil, Mexico and Colombia all called on Venezuela to release the full details of last Sunday's election.\n\nThe US State Department later said Mr Blinken had spoken to Mr Gonz\u00e1lez to congratulate him \"for receiving the most votes\". In a call with Mr Gonz\u00e1lez and the opposition party's leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, Mr Blinken \"expressed his concern for their safety and well-being\" and \"condemned all political violence and repression\". On Friday, Venezuela's election authority ratified Mr Maduro's disputed victory - saying he had won about 52% of votes to Mr Gonz\u00e1lez's 43%, from 97% of votes counted. Mr Maduro accused the opposition of producing fake evidence to contest the result of the election and said the US was behind what he described as a farce and a coup attempt. In a media conference, he also blamed the opposition for spreading false information and encouraging violence in Venezuela. Last Sunday, the electoral council, which is government-controlled, announced President Maduro had won the election for a third term. But this was immediately disputed by the opposition who said, with access to the majority of receipts from electronic voting machines around the country, it was false. The opposition has said its own vote tally shows it won the election by a wide margin. Opinion polls ahead of the election had suggested a clear victory for the challenger. The announcement of Mr Maduro\u2019s victory on Sunday set off deadly protests in Caracas. It has also attracted global criticism, with many governments around the world demanding the Venezuelan government release proof of the result.\n\nEPA Riot police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters in Caracas as thousands demonstrated against the outcome of Sunday's presidential poll\n\nThe result has been recognised by Venezuelan allies China, Russia and Iran. But, the US, European Union and other G7 countries have called on Mr Maduro\u2019s government to release detailed voting data. Posting on social media, Mr Blinken said: \"Electoral data overwhelmingly demonstrate the will of the Venezuelan people: democratic opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez won the most votes in Sunday\u2019s election. \"Venezuelans have voted, and their votes must count.\" The intervention by Mr Blinken is significant. After the last election in 2018 was widely dismissed as neither free nor fair, countries including the US decided to recognise the then-opposition leader Juan Guaido as interim president and imposed sanctions on Venezuela. Mr Blinken said it was \"time for the Venezuelan parties to begin discussions on a respectful, peaceful transition in accordance with Venezuelan electoral law and the wishes of the Venezuelan people\". Argentine Foreign Minister Diana Mondino shared Mr Blinken's view, writing in a post on X, formerly Twitter: \"We can all confirm, without a doubt, that the legitimate winner and President-elect is Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez.\" Ecuador, Uruguay, Costa Rica and Peru have also recognised Mr Gonz\u00e1lez as the president-elect. However, the governments of Brazil, Colombia and Mexico called for an \"impartial verification\" of the result, urging Venezuela to publish voting data broken down by polling stations in a joint statement.",

        "text": "Democrats begin process to nominate Harris for president: What to know\nThe party has launched virtual roll call to confirm the US vice president as the Democratic nominee to face Trump in November.\n\nThe Democratic Party has begun the process of formally nominating Kamala Harris as its candidate for the United States presidential elections, less than two weeks after the vice president officially launched her campaign.\n\nDemocratic National Convention delegates began officially selecting their nominee for president on Thursday morning in what\u2019s known as a virtual roll call.\n\nHarris, who was thrust into the presidential race last month after President Joe Biden dropped his bid for re-election, is the only candidate being considered in the roll-call vote.\n\nTypically, the roll call is held at the party\u2019s national convention, a large in-person gathering held every four years to select the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nBut this year, Democrats have chosen to use an electronic voting system that is poised to see Harris secure the nomination before the Democratic National Convention later this month in Chicago.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about the process.\n\nHow does the roll call work exactly?\n\nThe roll call is basically a vote.\n\nNearly 4,700 delegates are selected to represent states and territories across the US. They typically cast votes at the party convention to choose the presidential nominee based on primary and caucus results.\n\nBut this year \u2014 as during the last election cycle \u2014 the delegates are voting on an online platform set up by the Democratic National Committee (DNC).\n\nOn a rolling basis, each delegate is getting a \u201cpersonalised and watermarked\u201d form to cast their vote, US media outlets have reported.\n\nTo win the nomination, Harris needs the support of at least 1,976 delegates. But her ability to clinch the nomination isn\u2019t in doubt, with The Associated Press news agency reporting last month that she had far exceeded that threshold.\n\nSince the vice president had no challengers for the nomination, the electronic voting opened on August 1, as per DNC rules.\n\nHow long will the roll call take?\n\nIt will last several days, with the vote set to close at 6pm on the US East Coast (22:00 GMT) on Monday.\n\nWhy did Democrats choose to hold a virtual vote?\n\nThe party had planned to hold a virtual roll call even before President Biden dropped out of the race amid concerns about his age and ability to serve another term in office.\n\nThat\u2019s because the state of Ohio had set an August 7 deadline to get on the presidential ballot there.\n\nThat date came well before the in-person party convention, set to start on August 19. Democrats feared Republicans could try to keep Biden out of the running if the nomination process had not been completed by the Ohio deadline.\n\nJaime Harrison, the chairman of the DNC, said in a statement in May that the virtual roll call would \u201censure that Republicans can\u2019t chip away at our democracy through incompetence or partisan tricks and that Ohioans can exercise their right to vote for the presidential candidate of their choice\u201d.\n\nWhile Ohio has since moved its registration deadline back, Democrats expressed concern that Republicans could still challenge a candidate who has not been confirmed before August 7.\n\nThat\u2019s why they continued with their plans to use the virtual roll call with Harris as the presumptive nominee.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump was officially confirmed as the Republican nominee during the party\u2019s in-person convention in July.\n\nIs this the first virtual roll call?\n\nNo. The Democratic Party held its first virtual roll call during the last presidential election, in 2020.\n\nThat year marked the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, and safety restrictions prevented thousands of delegates from convening in the same room, as they had done in the past.\n\nSo instead, the delegates broadcast from their home states, some filming outdoors near iconic sites. A representative for Alabama\u2019s delegates, for instance, spoke in front of the Edmund Pettus Bridge, a symbol of the US civil rights movement.\n\nWhat have Democrats said about the process?\n\nWhen Biden was still the party\u2019s presumptive nominee, some Democratic lawmakers in Congress had criticised the early roll call.\n\nThey questioned whether it was a tactic to force through Biden\u2019s nomination, despite increasing appeals for him to withdraw from the race.\n\nUS media outlets reported in mid-July that some Democrats on Capitol Hill circulated a letter arguing there was \u201cno legal justification\u201d for the virtual proceedings because Ohio had moved the August 7 deadline back.\n\n\u201cWe respectfully but emphatically request that you cancel any plans for an accelerated \u2018virtual roll call\u2019 and further refrain from any extraordinary procedures that could be perceived as curtailing legitimate debate,\u201d the letter read, as reported by Axios.\n\nBut with Biden\u2019s exit from the race on July 21, Democrats have coalesced around Harris and dropped their objections to the process.\n\n\u201cRemember that the DNC announced an open process,\u201d Congressman Maxwell Frost of Florida wrote on social media on July 22.\n\n\u201cJust because the VP is such a unifying candidate & getting many endorsements, doesn\u2019t mean this process isn\u2019t open. Anyone can run. When she wins our nomination, it won\u2019t be because she was anointed, it\u2019ll be because she earned it.\u201d\n\nRemember that the DNC announced an open process. Just because the VP is such a unifying candidate & getting many endorsements, doesn\u2019t mean this process isn\u2019t open. Anyone can run. When she wins our nomination, it won\u2019t be because she was anointed, it\u2019ll be because she earned it. \u2014 Maxwell Alejandro Frost (@MaxwellFrostFL) July 22, 2024\n\nWhat have Republicans said?\n\nOhio Secretary of State Frank LaRose has lambasted the Democratic National Committee for using his state\u2019s ballot deadline \u201cto justify\u201d the early roll call.\n\nIn a letter to the DNC chairman, LaRose \u2014 Ohio\u2019s chief elections officer \u2014 said he had confirmed with the state attorney general \u201cthat Ohio law does not require the DNC to conduct a \u2018virtual roll call\u2019 prior to [the party\u2019s] scheduled August convention dates\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confident that your attorneys are well-aware of this fact, and I suspect your current rhetorical posturing is part of a plan to replace the incumbent president without a contested convention or any kind of democratic process,\u201d he wrote on July 25.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clever, if not completely antithetical to your party\u2019s relentless finger wagging about threats to democracy, but I ask that you stop using Ohio to justify your course of action.\u201d\n\nHe added that, as long as Democrats certify their nominations for president and vice president by September 1, they would appear on Ohio ballots in November.\n\nWhat about Harris\u2019s vice presidential pick?\n\nHarris has been in the presidential race for less than two weeks at this point. She has not yet picked a vice president to run alongside her on the Democratic ticket.\n\nBut US media outlets have reported that her running mate could be announced any day now.\n\nSeveral names have emerged atop the list of possible vice-presidential nominees, including Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro.\n\nHarris can still announce her vice presidential pick after the virtual nomination process is complete, according to the revised DNC rules. That person would then be added to her ticket.\n\nSo if Harris and her VP are confirmed, what happens at the convention?\n\nTypically, the conventions are where the roll-call votes take place. So what now?\n\nThis month\u2019s Democratic convention will still host votes \u2014 including a state-by-state roll call \u2014 to recognise the party\u2019s presidential and vice-presidential nominees, but they will be \u201ccelebratory and ceremonial\u201d, the DNC says on its website.\n\nWhile the nominees can theoretically be contested, most conventions in recent years have served as a platform to unite party members behind their respective candidates.\n\nThe Democratic National Convention will take place over four days, from August 19 to 22, in Chicago, Illinois.",

        "text": "Venezuelan opposition leader thanks U.S. for recognizing him as presidential election's winner\nVenezuela's opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia thanked the U.S. on Friday for recognizing him as the official winner of Sunday's controversial presidential election, in which both Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia and President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro claimed victory.\n\n\"We thank the United States for recognizing the will of the Venezuelan people reflected in our electoral victory and for supporting the process of restoring democratic norms in Venezuela,\" Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia wrote on X.\n\nThe United States' recognition of Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia as Venezuela's president-elect is based on evidence the opposition released this week, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday night.\n\nThe opposition published more than 80% of electoral tally sheets they directly received from polling stations throughout Venezuela on Election Day. Those tallies show that Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia obtained 66% of the votes while Maduro received about 31%, according to a site NBC News accessed on Wednesday where the opposition released the results of their count.\n\n\"Those tally sheets indicate that Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia received the most votes in this election by an insurmountable margin,\" Blinken said in a statement Thursday. \"Given the overwhelming evidence, it is clear to the United States and, most importantly, to the Venezuelan people that Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia won.\"\n\nThe U.S. now joins Uruguay, Argentina and Peru, the first nation to recognize Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia's win, in discrediting the official election results announced by Maduro's regime.\n\nA few hours after Blinken's announcement on Thursday, half a dozen masked assailants ransacked the headquarters of the opposition party, including the office of Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, the main leader of the opposition movement who was barred from being on the ballot by Maduro's government.\n\nVente Venezuela, the opposition party Machado belongs to, published images on social media showing several walls covered in black spray paint alongside a message saying the assailants broke down doors and hauled away valuable documents and equipment in raid they said happened at around 3 a.m.\n\nThe raid follows threats by Maduro and top government officials who are loyal to him to arrest Machado. While it\u2019s unclear whether there is an official arrest warrant against her, Machado said she has gone into hiding out of fear.\n\nWhile in hiding, she has continued to urge the international community to challenge the election results announced by Maduro\u2019s regime and called on her supporters to show up to a demonstration in Caracas Saturday.\n\nOpposition leader Maria Corina Machado, center left, and opposition presidential candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, center right, greet supporters at a protest against the result of the presidential election in Caracas, Venezuela, on Tuesday. Jesus Vargas / Getty Images\n\nCalls from multiple governments, including close allies of Maduro like Colombia and Brazil, are pushing for Venezuela\u2019s National Electoral Council to release detailed vote counts, as it has done during previous elections.\n\nThe electoral body, which is loyal to Maduro's regime, declared him the winner Monday, claiming he was re-elected for a third term after winning 51% of the votes without releasing the vote counts that would help corroborate such results. On Friday, Elvis Amoroso of the National Electoral Council insisted Maduro won, claiming that his margin of victory remained relatively the same after accounting for 97% of the votes.\n\nAmoroso did not provide detailed electoral tallies that governments around the world have called for.\n\nThe governments of Brazil, Colombia and Mexico issued a joint statement Thursday doubling down on their calls for an independent review of election results and urging Venezuela\u2019s electoral authorities \u201cto move forward expeditiously and publicly release\u201d detailed voting data.\n\n\u201cThe fundamental principle of popular sovereignty must be respected through impartial verification of the results,\u201d the statement reads.\n\nThe statement does not confirm any backroom diplomatic efforts to persuade Maduro\u2019s government to publish the vote tallies.\n\nGovernment officials from Brazil, Colombia and Mexico have told The Associated Press that they have been in constant communication with Maduro\u2019s administration to convince him that he must show the vote tally sheets from Sunday\u2019s election and allow impartial verification.\n\nOn Wednesday, Maduro asked Venezuela\u2019s highest court to conduct an audit of the election, but hat request drew criticism from foreign observers who said the court is controlled by Maduro sympathizers. It is also the same court that banned Machado from being on the ballot in January, causing Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia to emerge as the opposition\u2019s surrogate candidate in May.\n\nOn Thursday, the court accepted Maduro\u2019s request for an audit and ordered him, Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia and the eight other candidates who participated in the presidential election to appear before the justices Friday.\n\nAsked why electoral authorities have not released detailed vote counts, Maduro said the National Electoral Council has come under attack, including cyber-attacks, without elaborating.\n\nThe controversy over the election results is fueling fears of increased protests and violence amid the international debate and lack of consensus.\n\nSince protests broke out Monday, thousands of opposition supporters have taken to the streets and the Venezuelan government has said it's arrested hundreds of protesters, including former opposition candidate Freddy Superlano.\n\nThe Venezuelan nongovernmental organization Pro Vea has identified at least 15 protesters who have been killed since demonstrations began, and it continues to verify more reports of deaths.\n\nVenezuela has the world\u2019s largest proven crude reserves and once boasted Latin America\u2019s most advanced economy, but it entered into free fall after Maduro took the helm in 2013. Plummeting oil prices, widespread shortages and hyperinflation that soared past 130,000% led to social unrest and mass emigration.\n\nMore than 7.7 million Venezuelans have left the country since 2014, the largest exodus in Latin America\u2019s recent history.",

        "text": "August 1, 2024, presidential campaign news\nSen. JD Vance gives remarks at a campaign rally at Arizona Christian University on July 31 in Glendale, Arizona. Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n\nJD Vance is making a second pass at introducing himself to America as the Ohio senator faces questions on whether he was the best choice for former President Donald Trump\u2019s running mate after his past comments came to light.\n\nSimply put, the plan to get past this stretch is more Vance, not less, and the vice presidential nominee\u2019s days have been filled with visits to battleground states.\n\nHe spoke at a campaign rally in Nevada on Tuesday and another in Arizona on Wednesday. On Thursday morning, he is scheduled to go to the US-Mexico border, a regular campaign pilgrimage for Republicans. He will also appear in Georgia with Trump on Saturday.\n\nThere are plans for Vance to sit for a series of interviews with conservative and mainstream media outlets, according to people with knowledge of his upcoming schedule. The Trump campaign also hopes to capitalize on the generational contrast Vance brings to the race \u2014 he turns 40 on Friday \u2014 by having him appear on longer-form podcasts and digital shows that target younger audiences.\n\nVance is also expected to begin holding news conferences with reporters as early as this week, a source said.\n\nAnd he will be tasked as the campaign\u2019s policy attack dog, a role he embraced Tuesday as he stumped across Nevada trashing Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 past immigration stances and tying her to the current administration\u2019s recent battles with inflation.\n\nHarris, meanwhile, is set to travel to several battlegrounds next week with her running mate, whom she is expected to announce in the coming days.\n\nRead more here.",

It can be concluded by the results of six opinion polls held within 48 hours. Harris was ahead in four polls while Trump was leading in just two surveys. According to 'Newsweek', Kamala Harris was up by 4 percentage points in a Civiqs survey, 3 points in a Leger survey, 2 points in a YouGov survey and a point in an Ispos survey. On the other hand, Trump got a 2-point advantage in a McLaughlin poll and a 2.6-point advantage in an ActiVote poll.The voters are happy with US President Joe Biden's decision of pulling out of the race and endorsing his vice president. The way Democrats rallied behind Kamala Harris is showing positive signs and may pay rich dividends to the party that was in shambles over the question of leadership only a few weeks ago.According to 'Newsweek', in the Leger poll, Kamala Harris got a 3-point advantage over Donald Trump in a head-to-head contest, she led with a bigger margin when other candidates were taken into out as well. While the Democrat contender led the Republican candidate by 7 points, with 48 percent support to his 41 percent with independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. leading third-party candidates at 5 percent. The Leger poll was held from July 26 to July 28 and 1,002 people were contacted.Kamala Harris was seen getting strong support from people in the age group of 18 to 49 and Trump was found trailing by four points in the Civiqs poll. The Democrat has a higher winnability rating than both Trump and his running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance. While 43% of respondents have a favorable opinion of the vice president, 42% favor Trump and 34 percent Vance.When the YouGov survey was conducted before Harris replaced Biden, Trump led by 2 points. But in Thursday's poll, Kamala Harris was seen bringing Democrats up 4 points and holding the advantage over Trump, with 46 percent to his 44 percent. The poll was held on July 27 and July 30 and 1,605 adults were contacted.Kamala Harris was seen getting strong support from people in the age group of 18 to 49 and Trump was found trailing by four points in the Civiqs poll.

America\u2019s Finally About to Try It.\n\u201cPolitics can feel like such a slog,\u201d Katie Paris, the founder of a political organization for suburban moms called Red, Wine & Blue, told the New York Times for a recent story about Kamala Harris\u2019 campaign momentum. \u201cNobody likes two-year presidential campaigns.\u201d The switch from Joe Biden to Harris had revitalized her organization, she said, and renewed her enthusiasm for the Democratic ticket.\n\nThis sudden energy is not unique to Katie Paris or to Red, Wine & Blue. Things really do feel better now! Of course, a great deal of that change is due to the different name on the yard signs. But part of it, too, comes from the way the presidential election seems to have been fully rebooted. Instead of feeling, accurately, like we\u2019re stuck in the middle of an eternal campaign that\u2019s been going on as long as we can remember, it feels like a brand-new beginning, with the ending already in sight.\n\nWelcome to the 107-Day Campaign. That\u2019s the number of days between July 21, when Biden withdrew, and Election Day. After loads of hand-wringing about how it was definitely too late to change candidates, it turns out that the Democrats\u2019 Hail Mary has given Americans a great gift: our first taste of a short presidential election in 50-plus years. When it\u2019s over, we\u2019re going to wish elections were all like this.\n\nRelated From Slate A Crucial Wisconsin Town Voted for Joe Biden by 19 Votes in 2020. People Here Have Thoughts About Kamala Harris. Read More\n\nThe race for the U.S. presidency hasn\u2019t always been a two-year nightmare. As recently as 1952, Dwight Eisenhower didn\u2019t even really start campaigning for president until June. (Before that, he was serving overseas as NATO commander.) But in the wake of the turbulent 1968 Democratic Convention, when many voters felt that Hubert Humphrey\u2014who hadn\u2019t even participated in the primaries\u2014had been handpicked by the party establishment, the McGovern-Fraser reforms gave voters a much greater say in the selection of Democratic candidates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSoon, states were changing caucuses to primaries, and then moving primaries earlier and earlier to beat each other out. State-by-state advertising arms races escalated until we got to where we are today\u2014a 2024 election season that officially started in November 2022, when Donald Trump announced his candidacy. That\u2019s just too long.\n\nOther countries don\u2019t do it this way! France\u2019s recent presidential election was about six weeks long: It started when the candidates declared in early March 2022, and ended with a second round of voting on April 24, 2022. The most recent Canadian election was just over a month long. In Japan, general election campaigns are restricted to 12 days. (OK, that might be a little short\u2014in the 2014 elections, the opposition party, caught by surprise, could barely scrape together candidates to run.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe advantages of a short campaign are obvious. Advertising plays a less crucial role, reducing the chances for deceptive or misleading messaging to sink in. Candidates spend less money, and therefore demand less money from rich donors with questionable objectives. (It also means that candidates without enormous war chests might stand a chance.) A shorter campaign lessens the endless horse-race coverage that rules in long campaigns when there\u2019s little to no actual news. Grueling campaigns grind down candidates, exhaust voters, and rarely teach us anything new about the possibilities, anyway: The voters who are really paying attention make up their minds quickly, and the voters who aren\u2019t paying attention\u2014the ones, by the way, who will decide this race\u2014don\u2019t even think about the election until, like, two weeks before. Does anyone really think they\u2019ve learned something new about Joe Biden and Donald Trump since January?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd honestly, long campaigns are flat-out toxic to everyone\u2019s well-being. No one other than actual politicians should be forced to think about politics for two straight years. What a drag! Think about all you could have gotten done if you hadn\u2019t been trying to keep up with Republican debates last August. Slate\u2019s politics writers would all have much lower blood pressure, because they could have been writing regular, interesting politics stories instead of chronicling this awful, not-normal election since the dawn of time. (They also might have had a little more time to pursue their cool hobbies, like golf, surfing, and lawn care.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShort campaigns can also lead to delightful surprises. In January of 2016, I visited Reykjavik and met a friendly history professor named Gu\u00f0ni J\u00f3hannesson at a municipal swimming pool. That spring he appeared on the TV news a couple of times, discussing the Panama Papers scandal, and often would return home to voicemails suggesting he run for president. In May he declared his candidacy; in June he was elected; on Aug. 1 he took office. He was a perfectly good president for eight years and a new president just took office earlier this week. You think Gu\u00f0ni would have run for president if it meant he had to turn his life upside down for two years?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, granted, many of these countries have systems that afford less power to the president than the United States does. (Would we want some random historian to become president? Well, I would, but maybe not everyone agrees.) But Mexico has a government system much like ours, with a president who\u2019s head of the executive branch, a bicameral legislature, and an independent judiciary. In Mexico, presidential elections are restricted to three months, with a two-month period the summer before to pick the major party nominees. Imagine if American presidential candidates declared during spring break, primaried until June, and then we all voted in November? What a dream.\n\nPretty much everyone in America, with the possible exception of local-TV ad salespeople in Wisconsin, hates our forever elections. Thanks to Joe Biden\u2019s decision to step away from the campaign, we\u2019ve been given a gift few living Americans have ever experienced as voters: a short, sweet election that just might end before we\u2019re all completely exhausted, annoyed, and disengaged. It\u2019s gonna be so much better. We should do whatever it takes to make this situation permanent. Take it from Katie Paris of Red, Wine & Blue. \u201cGive me 100 days, and OK!\u201d she said. \u201cI can grab my friends and do that.\u201d",

        "text": "Democrats\u2019 nomination of Harris shows how parties still control the process\nVice President Kamala Harris, shown here at a campaign event in Atlanta, Georgia, on July 30, is now officially the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nVotebeat is a nonprofit news organization reporting on voting access and election administration across the U.S.\n\nThis news analysis also appears in Votebeat\u2019s free weekly newsletter. Sign up to get future editions, including the latest reporting from Votebeat bureaus and curated news from other publications, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.\n\nDemocrats have nominated Kamala Harris as their 2024 presidential candidate \u2014 even though voters chose someone else in all the party\u2019s primaries. Can they just do that?\n\nSure. As it turns out, presidential primaries are something of an electoral illusion \u2014 and a rather convincing one.\n\nWhen President Joe Biden withdrew his reelection bid shortly before he was set to officially receive the nomination at the convention, it prompted everyone to take a crash course in How Parties Select Presidential Nominees.\n\nAnd as we\u2019re seeing now, parties can actually select their presidential nominees however they want, even if there are many reasons to abide by the voters\u2019 choice in the primaries.\n\nPeople accustomed to thinking of primaries in the straightforward mode of other elections \u2014 a candidate wins by getting the most votes \u2014 might find them to be a strange sort of beast, neither fish nor fowl. Political scientists and historians can provide the context that helps make sense of this curious process.\n\n\u201cOur parties operate in a kind of fiction of being public democracies,\u201d said Alexander Keyssar, a professor of history and social policy at Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School of Government and the author of \u201cThe Right to Vote: The Contested History of Democracy in the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the same time,\u201d he said, \u201cthe party itself retains some right of control.\u201d\n\nMost people probably think primary results are \u201cmore binding and durable\u201d than they really are, Keyssar said.\n\nThe Democratic presidential primaries this year weren\u2019t especially competitive. Biden, an incumbent president, faced fairly nominal opposition and won easily.\n\nBut remember that when people cast a presidential primary ballot, they\u2019re not really voting for the candidate. They\u2019re voting for a slate of delegates to the convention who pledge to support that candidate, at least on the first ballot. As candidates win more contests, they amass more convention delegates. And it\u2019s those delegates who ultimately select the nominee with their vote.\n\nAt least in theory, if enough delegates don\u2019t like the rules governing the process, they can just change them. \u201cA majority of delegates can decide whatever they want,\u201d points out Robert Speel, an associate professor of political science at Penn State Behrend.\n\nBut that might not be good politics.\n\nBiden\u2019s withdrawal created a scenario that was nearly unprecedented in modern times. The comparison many observers reached for was the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago \u2014 a contentious nomination process set against a backdrop of antiwar protests and a violent police response. The episode led to the creation of the modern primary system \u2014 and it explains a lot about why parties stick with it.\n\nBefore that point, different versions of primaries existed, but they didn\u2019t matter as much. Not all candidates chose to participate in them, and some did so more as a political tactic than a requirement, experts say. For example, John F. Kennedy famously used the 1960 West Virginia primary to show that a Catholic candidate could win support in Protestant parts of the country. So candidates competed in primaries, but in the end, party bosses controlled the candidate selection process.\n\nThat became most evident at the 1968 convention. Then-President Lyndon B. Johnson, facing poor approval ratings and dwindling support, had decided not to run for reelection. Robert F. Kennedy, a leading candidate for the Democratic nomination, had been assassinated two months earlier, immediately after sweeping the California primary. Democrats were, as some like to say, in disarray. At the convention, delegates nominated the sitting vice president, Hubert Humphrey, who hadn\u2019t competed in a single primary.\n\nHumphrey went on to lose to Republican Richard Nixon, and Democrats decided there had to be a better way. They appointed a commission headed by then-Sen. George McGovern of South Dakota to come up with it. The commission was \u201cthe biggest single change for the process of presidential selection in American history,\u201d said Byron Shafer, who wrote a book about it called \u201cQuiet Revolution: Struggle for the Democratic Party and the Shaping of Post-Reform Politics.\u201d\n\nThe result was, more or less, the primary system we have today, putting more power in the hands of ordinary voters, and linking delegates more tightly to candidates and nominees more tightly to the results. Republicans eventually adopted a similar process, though there appear to have been at least some skeptics. A memo sent to Nixon in June 1972 and now in the collection of the National Archives crowed, \u201cIn the name of \u2018reform\u2019, the Democrats have allowed the control of their party to pass into the hands of an ultra liberal, activist minority which is unrepresentative of any of the former factions of the old coalition.\u201d\n\nThe first Democratic presidential nominee produced under the new system was McGovern himself, who lost to Nixon resoundingly. But the process he brought about \u2014 using more robust primaries to democratize the selection of delegates, and shift power from party bosses and insiders to regular party members \u2014 has mostly stuck.\n\nIn 1980, a different commission created so-called superdelegates \u2014 typically party and elected officials with special voting power \u2014 as a check on the vagaries of the democratic process McGovern\u2019s commission created.\n\nBut the voting public has been hostile to ceding this power, and any suggestion that they might not have the final say. For example, in 2008, when the upstart Barack Obama was edging past establishment candidate Hillary Clinton for the presidential nomination, the idea that the superdelegates could tip the balance back to Clinton caused an uproar, and many of the superdelegates ended up switching their support to Obama. The issue came up again in 2016, when Clinton faced a strong challenge from Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\nIn the case of today\u2019s presidential shakeup, Shafer and others say, the delegates who were pledged to Biden took his quick endorsement of Harris to heart.

        "text": "Harris and Trump are tied in 538's new polling averages\nGood news, polling fans: 538 now has polling averages for the new presidential matchup between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. As of Friday at 10 a.m. Eastern, our average of national polls says Harris has the support of 45.0 percent of voters, while Trump garners 43.5 percent.\n\nThat 1.5-percentage-point lead is within our average's uncertainty interval, which you can think of as a sort of margin of error for our polling averages. We also have new Harris versus Trump polling averages for the key swing states of Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania, and the races there are within the uncertainty interval as well. (We will add polling averages for additional states as soon as we get enough polls in them.*)\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are tied in 538's new presidential general election polling average. 538 Photo Illustration\n\n538's averages are slightly better for Harris than the ones you'll find from other public aggregators. There are a few reasons for this. The most important is that our average only considers polls that began interviewing voters after President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential election and endorsed Harris to be the Democratic nominee. (It is long-standing 538 policy not to include horse-race polls with candidates that aren't actually running in our models.) Because those earlier polls were asking about a then-hypothetical matchup, voters may have been thinking about the candidates in theoretical ways that are no longer relevant to today's very real contest. Indeed, by our estimate, Harris has performed about 3 points better nationally in polls conducted after Biden's withdrawal than before it.\n\nAnother reason our averages are better for Harris is that 538 adjusts polls that were conducted among registered voters (marked as \"RV\" on our polls page) or all adults (\"A\") toward the results of likely voter (\"LV\") polls. We make this adjustment because we know for a fact that not all adults or even all registered voters will vote in the election, and the types of people who vote differ from nonvoters in predictable ways.\n\nSpecifically, there is evidence that likely voters are now a bit more Democratic than the general population; for example, likely voter polls of Trump versus Biden tended to look better for Democrats than polls of that matchup among registered voters or all adults. Our average makes this adjustment by looking for systematic differences between likely voter and registered voter/all adult polls after controlling for other factors, such as the pollster who conducted the poll, the mode it was conducted with, the time it was conducted, etc.\n\nWithout this adjustment, Harris and Trump would be tied at 44.0 percent nationally (based on polls conducted since July 22 and released by Aug. 1). But Harris's margin is about 0.2 points higher in likely voter polls than in registered voter polls and about 0.6 points higher in likely voter polls than in polls of all adults. Controlling for this alone increases our estimate of Harris's margin by 0.5 points.\n\n538's polling averages also look for differences between polls that do and do not give voters the ability to say they support third-party candidates, such as independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (who currently averages 5.7 percent support nationally). We make this adjustment because most voters will have more options than just Harris and Trump on Election Day (depending on which candidates qualify for the ballot in which states), so head-to-head polls are not asking about a real election either. We find that, when Kennedy is included in polls, Harris's margin over Trump grows by about 0.5 points.\n\nFinally, Harris gets another boost in our national average because of how well she is doing in the few state polls that have been conducted since Biden's withdrawal. On average, in 2020, Biden beat Trump by 3.8 points in the states that have been polled for Harris versus Trump so far. Her average polling lead in those states today is 1.1 points. If you apply that 2.7-point shift toward Trump to the national popular vote (which Biden won by 4.5 points in 2020), you get a predicted national environment of Harris+1.8 today.\n\nAll in all, Harris is polling better against Trump than Biden, who was trailing by more than 3 points nationally on the day he dropped out. (You can still access our old Biden-Trump averages by clicking the link in the banner at the top of our national polling average page or at the top of any state polling page that used to have a Biden-Trump average.) But it's an open question whether that will last. As the new nominee, Harris may be enjoying a honeymoon period, and an amped-up Democratic base may be more likely to respond to surveys than Republicans \u2014 a phenomenon known as differential partisan nonresponse. It's also possible that the initial boost of enthusiasm she has received will fade over time. You can bookmark the interactive page for our new averages and keep up with the latest polls as soon as they come in.\n\nFootnotes\n\n*As explained in our polls policy, we do not publish polling averages of presidential general elections in a given state until we've aggregated at least five polls of that state from at least three pollsters. In this unique circumstance, we are further limiting that to polls conducted entirely after Biden dropped out. For aesthetic reasons, we also wait a few days after meeting this threshold to publish the average, so that the chart doesn't just have one point and one day of a line on it. That's why Arizona and Wisconsin, which have already met the five poll/three pollster threshold, don't have averages yet; we plan to publish those by Monday.",

        "text": "Fact: In NC, if an Election Worker Writes on Your Ballot, It Does Not Invalidate It\nRaleigh, N.C.\n\nThe following is a statement from the State Board of Elections regarding social media posts and other communications suggesting that if an election worker writes on your ballot, it would invalidate it.\n\nIn North Carolina, this is false. These posts have been circulating for years and have resurfaced recently in many N.C. counties. They are still false.\n\nElection workers often do write on ballots for different reasons as required by law.\n\nFor example, election workers write an identifying number on the ballots of voters who vote by mail or during the in-person early voting period. This is a special number assigned to each ballot and voter. This number allows the ballot to be retrieved and not counted if necessary due to a voter challenge, such as if the voter dies before Election Day or votes more than once. See Retrievable ballots (N.C.G.S. \u00a7 163-166.45).\n\nThe number can also be used to retrieve ballots in the event of a successful election protest, such as if several voters are given the wrong ballot style and the margin for a contest is less than that number of voters.\n\nIn certain counties, voters\u2019 precincts also must be written on ballots cast during the early voting period so they can be sorted back into the proper precincts after the election for reporting and data purposes, also as required by law. See Voting data maintained by precinct (N.C.G.S. \u00a7 163-132.5G). Early voters may cast their ballot at any early voting site in their county, thus creating the need to sort ballots by precinct after each election.\n\nElection Day ballots are not retrievable, but poll workers may need to write the precinct name on ballots for post-election sorting. They may also write notations on provisional ballots.\n\nPoll workers should generally not be placing any other markings on the ballot. But stray marks on a ballot should not prevent the ballot from being tabulated, as long as the bars on the margin of the ballot and the selection ovals are not affected. Once the ballot goes into the tabulator, the machine uses the bars and the shading of ovals to determine the selections on that ballot, and that ballot will be tabulated just like any other ballot that gets inserted into the tabulator, regardless of any writing in the white space of the ballot.\n\nThe 2024 general election is 95 days away on Nov. 5. The first absentee ballots are expected to be sent out on Sept. 6. In-person early voting runs from Oct. 17 through Nov. 2.\n\nFor accurate information about N.C. elections, go to ncsbe.gov or contact your county board of elections.",

Gazans weigh in\nTrump or Harris for Gaza Some Palestinians believe that if the new US president aims to impose justice in the world, he or she will impose sanctions on Israel or at least force it to stop its war in Gaza and its violations in the Palestinian Territories. (Jon Cherry, Michelle Zenarosa/Getty Images)\n\nThe impending US elections cast shadows over the ongoing conflict between the Palestinian Hamas movement and Israel in Gaza, as Palestinians hope that the US elections will end the bloody war that has left more than 39,445 Palestinians dead, according to official numbers from the health ministry in Gaza.\n\nA study published in July by the prestigious, peer-reviewed medical journal, Lancet, estimates that Israeli actions since October 2023 could result in over 186,000 deaths in Gaza, with many caused by diseases and other indirect factors rather than direct violence.\n\nThe war came after Hamas launched an attack on Israeli towns adjacent to the Gaza Strip on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people, according to official Israeli statistics.\n\nOver the last 300 days, attitudes on the Israel-Hamas war have shifted, leading to a surge in activism and protests across the United States, including a large-scale college encampment movement. This growing movement has the potential to influence the upcoming presidential election, as both presidential candidates address the heightened public concern and polarized opinions on the conflict.\n\nFor Palestinians, the behavior of Kamala Harris, the current US Vice President and expected Democratic Party candidate, in boycotting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s speech in the US Congress last week offered hope that someone would advocate for justice and help them end the war in the Gaza Strip soon.\n\nAfter meeting Netanyahu in Washington, Harris said that she would not remain silent in the face of the tragedies and suffering, describing the past nine months in Gaza as \u201cdevastating,\u201d especially regarding the killing of children, and called on Netanyahu to immediately stop the war in Gaza.\n\nNearly 11 months in, famine, starvation, shortages of clean water and medicine, and unsanitary conditions in Gaza are causing hunger, disease, and dehydration that are already killing many Palestinians and could surpass the death toll from Israel\u2019s military campaign. A ceasefire is an \u201cabsolute requirement\u201d to turn the hunger crisis around, says WFP Palestine Country Director ad interim Matthew Hollingworth.\n\nIbrahim Salah, a displaced man based in Khan Younis suffering from the dire reality in Gaza, expressed hope for real change in the US position under Harris\u2019s leadership towards what he called the Israeli \u201cgenocide\u201d in the besieged coastal enclave.\n\n\u201cWe felt sadness over the Arab silence during the current war, but the US people and other European populations, let us feel that we are not alone in this war,\u201d Salah said. \u201cCampaigns that tell the US leaders that [the people] will not remain silent, give us more power and more hope that the war will end soon.\u201d\n\nMariam Kamal, a Egypt-based Gazan woman who escaped from death in Gaza four months ago, shared a similar sentiment.\n\n\u201cWhen arrived in Egypt, I thought I will never come back to my Gaza City as I believed that Israel will do its best to evacuate all the Palestinians in Gaza, but when I heard Harris\u2019s speech that said she will not remain silent I returned my hope to see Gaza once again once the war ends,\u201d the 26-year-old accountant said.\n\nShe added, \u201cI know that the current American generation is aware of our suffering, so they will do their best to achieve justice. Harris also knows that very well, so she will never risk her political future in exchange for protecting Israel.\u201d\n\nA slight change and a preferred candidate\n\nNidal Hassouna, a Gaza-based Palestinian political expert, believes that Harris\u2019s statements represent a \u201cslight change\u201d in the US policy toward the ongoing war on Gaza.\n\nHe noted that this may be one of the few times since the beginning of the war that a high-level voice in the US has spoken about \u201cjustice\u201d for Palestinian civilians.\n\nHassouna believes that Harris, who still supports Israel, has no problem criticizing Netanyahu publicly. He also believes that there may be indication that she supports stopping the war, avoiding the occupation of the Gaza Strip, and addressing the dire humanitarian situation in the besieged strip since 2007.\n\nMany Palestinians in Gaza tend to hope that Harris will win over Republican candidate Donald Trump, whom Palestinians consider one of the US presidents who they believe greatly harmed the Palestinian cause.\n\nHanan Alian, an engineer who was displaced to the city of Deir al-Balah, said she would prefer anyone over Trump.\n\n\u201cWe do not have the luxury of following any news due to the circumstances and the power outages since months, but if you ask me who I hope will win, I will say Harris is my favorite candidate,\u201d said Alian, who currently works as a vendor making candies and sweets for families.\n\nAlthough Palestinians do not know much about Harris, they were impressed by her ability to publicly criticize Netanyahu, the ongoing war, and the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza.\n\n\u201cWe do not prefer Trump to come,\u201d said displaced Ahmed Awad, sitting at the door of his tent in the Al-Mawasi area west of Khan Yunis, south of the Gaza Strip.\n\nPalestinians\u2019 preference for Harris over Trump stems from the former US president\u2019s policy towards Palestinian issues, such as recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel in 2017 and moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem the following year. These actions were seen by Palestinians as undermining their aspirations for East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state and as a firm endorsement of Israeli sovereignty over the contested city.\n\nIn 2019, Trump recognized Israeli settlements in the West Bank as legal, in blatant defiance of international law, and halted US support for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). This action was seen as tacit approval of Israel\u2019s expansion into occupied Palestinian territories.\n\n\u201cWe hope that if Harris wins the election, she will put pressure on Israel and put an end to the fighting that has been going on for 10 months,\u201d said Awad, a father of three who lost his home and several family members in an Israeli bombardment of Gaza City last November.\n\nPalestinians in Gaza have expressed satisfaction with the American popular movement and campaigns that were launched to support the Palestinians, such as the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights and the actions organized by Jewish Voices for Peace, and some celebrities like Cardi B and Kehlani who have explicitly called for a ceasefire and an arms embargo on Israel. This, from their point of view, is what caused Biden\u2019s popularity to decline, especially since they hold him responsible for Israel\u2019s persistence in its war on civilians up to this point.\n\nHowever, Palestinians fear that Harris will not be able to achieve a ceasefire or pressure Israel, especially since Netanyahu persistent resistance to ending the conflict in Gaza.\n\nNevertheless, some Palestinians believe that if the new US president aims to impose justice in the world, he or she will impose sanctions on Israel or at least force it to stop its war in Gaza and its violations in the Palestinian Territories.\n\n\u201cI cannot imagine Donald Trump would get a place in the White House once again. Absolutely, he will support Israel forever even if Israel commits more and more massacres against us,\u201d Samia al-Alami, a Gaza-based woman, told Reckon. The 39-year-old mother of four lost her entire family during an Israeli airstrike that attacked her house in al-Yarmouk neighborhood in Gaza City in February.\n\n\u201cNo one can imagine how we live under such war, but Harris, [as a woman], can put herself in our shoes. For a moment if she thinks about us as humans who need only to live in peace, she will never let Israel continue its crimes in Gaza and even in all the Palestinian Territories.\u201d\n\nTrump influence: Could a presidency alter Netanyahu\u2019s stance on Gaza?\n\nIn contrast, political analyst Saleh Lotfi believes that a Trump presidency could alter the grim reality in Gaza and potentially end the war.\n\nLotfi argues that Trump may have more influence over Netanyahu than current President Joe Biden, who has provided absolute support with weapons and money to Israel and visited the country during the war and has recently announced his withdrawal from the presidential race.\n\nTrump has criticized what he described as the weakness of the current US administration that the October 7 attack would not have happened on his watch..\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s public stance against military interventions, his administration aimed to expand Israeli power in the Middle East, exemplified by the controversial Deal of the Century.\n\nLutfi suggests that Trump \u201cwill work to stop the war on Gaza within the framework of a more comprehensive deal represented by normalization with an Arab Muslim country, most likely the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which may make Netanyahu salivate.\u201d\n\nTrump is seen as a favorite of Netanyahu, given their achievements in normalizing relations with Arab nations\u2014the UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan\u2014during Trump\u2019s first term.\n\nHowever, both Lotfi and Hassouna agree that both major U.S. parties, the Republicans and Democrats, are likely to continue their strong support for Israel.\n\nA call for US action\n\nRadi Kamal, a displaced resident based in Deir al-Balah, is still dreaming of coming back to his home in Tel al-Hawa neighborhood in the west of Gaza City.\n\nThe 41-year-old father of six was forced to evacuate his area with hundreds of his neighbors to avoid the death. But, he recalls, he had not imagined that his real suffering would start after displacing his house and his city.\n\n\u201cI thought that I would be far away from my house for a few days, but as you see, I have enrolled for the tenth month while I do know if I would survive or even if I would return back to my house,\u201d he lamented.\n\nHe hopes for an end to the war and the possibility of returning home to rebuild his life, urging the world to help end the conflict as soon as possible. He said \u201cit will never be easy, but we can [end it] and we can manage our life once again (...) just I am asking the world to help us stop the mad war as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Palestinian Authority called on the US administration and Congress to pressure Israel and Netanyahu\u2019s government to cease hostilities on Gaza.\n\nNabil Abu Rudeineh, the official spokesman for the Palestinian presidency, accused Israel of violating all the prohibitions established by international law during its war on Gaza.\n\nAbu Rudeineh called on the US administration to force Israel, its strategic ally, to stop its \u201caggression\u201d and comply with international legitimacy decisions and international court decisions, and not to give it support to continue its \u201cbrutal crimes\u201d while it bears responsibility for everything that is happening in Gaza, the West Bank and Jerusalem.\n\nAhmed Masood is a journalist based in Gaza.",

        "text": "Harris makes history as first Black woman, Asian American presidential nominee\nWASHINGTON \u2212 The party votes have been cast: Vice President Kamala Harris is officially the 2024 Democratic presidential nominee \u2212 making U.S. history as the first Black woman and first Asian American from a major party to win that designation.\n\nHarris secured the Democratic nomination on Friday afternoon, receiving the majority of votes \u2212 at least 2,350 \u2212 from her party's delegates, just one day after voting opened. The Democratic National Committee held a livestream video hosted by Biden campaign aides and DNC chairman Jaime Harrison to mark the occasion.\n\n\"I am honored to be the presumptive Democratic nominee for President of the United States,\" Harris said moments after she passed the delegate threshold during a Democratic party-sponsored livestream phone call. \"Your dedication cannot be overstated. Your dedication to our country. I know we all feel this way so strongly. We love our country, we believe in the promise of America, and that's what this campaign is about.\"\n\nHarris said she will officially accept the nomination next week, once the virtual voting period concludes on Monday. She added that she's looking forward to the Democratic National Convention that begins Aug. 19 in Chicago to \"have an opportunity to celebrate this historic moment together.\"\n\nHarris, 59, catapulted to the top of the ticket after President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential election on July 21. Harris will go on to face Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, the 45th president, in November.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nVice President Harris quickly gained the backing of top leaders in her party, including Biden, former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. She's also been raking in record-breaking donations less than two weeks into her candidacy.\n\nThe DNC began a virtual roll call on Thursday at 9 a.m. for delegates to vote for Harris as the party\u2019s candidate. Delegates still have until the deadline on Monday at 6 p.m. ET to return their ballots.\n\n\u201cI am so proud to confirm that Vice President Harris has earned more than a majority of votes from all convention delegates and will be the nominee of the Democratic Party,\u201d Harrison said during the livestream.\n\nHe added: \u201cToday, my friends, is special because we can proudly say that we will have the first woman of color at the top of a major party ticket.\u201d\n\nEven before voting opened, Harris had accumulated more than enough delegate support to win the nomination.\n\nHarris is expected to announce a vice presidential candidate before she is scheduled to appear in Philadelphia on Tuesday with her highly anticipated running mate. Additional stops next week for the duo are planned for western Wisconsin; Detroit; Raleigh, N.C.; Savannah, Ga.; Phoenix; and Las Vegas.\n\nThe DNC imposed a Wednesday deadline to virtually confirm the party's presidential and vice presidential nominees ahead of the Democratic National Convention later this month.\n\nWith less than 100 days until the election, the race between the two candidates is heating up.\n\nTrump, the Republican nominee, and Harris are in a dead heat in several competitive, battleground states.\n\nThe former president has come out swinging against the Democratic candidate. During a combative interview on Wednesday at the National Association of Black Journalists annual conference, Trump used racist rhetoric toward Harris, questioning her racial identity. Harris, who slammed Trump's remarks, is Black and of South Asian descent.\n\nHarris is facing an uptick in racist and misogynistic attacks after she became the leading candidate for the Democrats.\n\nTrump and GOP allies have labeled Harris as a \u201cDEI candidate\u201d \u2212 a talking point using the acronym for diversity, equity and inclusion that conservatives are using to disqualify people of color or women who ascend to positions of power and influence.\n\nDays after Harris became the Democratic candidate, a video of Sen. JD Vance, Trump\u2019s running mate, resurfaced that implied Harris was among top Democrats who were \u201cchildless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they\u2019ve made.\u201d\n\nVance made those comments during an appearance on Fox News' \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" in July 2021 while he was running for Ohio's U.S. Senate seat. He said at the time that \u201cthe entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children.\" Harris is the stepmother of two children.",

        "text": "Trump supporters wasted no time in claiming Kamala Harris is ineligible to be president, but they\u2019re wrong\nYou may have heard the rumor that Kamala Harris isn\u2019t eligible to be president because neither of her parents was born in the United States and they had unclear citizenship status when Harris was born in Oakland, California, in 1964.\n\nThat\u2019s the false claim that some Harris opponents have begun recirculating since she became the Democrats\u2019 presumptive nominee for president following President Joe Biden\u2019s decision to step aside on July 21, 2024. The claim originated in 2020, when she was chosen as Biden\u2019s vice presidential running mate.\n\nJohn Eastman, Trump\u2019s former legal adviser who was indicted for allegedly interfering with the 2020 presidential election, originally circulated this claim. But mainstream legal scholars agree: There\u2019s no truth to it.\n\nThe recycling of this falsehood offers an opportunity to dive into the actual facts about presidential eligibility, by way of some candidates from recent history.\n\nHarris is protected by birthright citizenship\n\nHow do we know that claims about Harris\u2019 eligibility are wrong?\n\nArticle II, Section 1 of the Constitution sets the rule: \u201cNo Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution,\u201d says Section 1, \u201cshall be eligible to the Office of President.\u201d\n\nThe other presidential requirements in the Constitution \u2014 that a candidate be at least 35 years old and have lived in the U.S. for 14 years prior to their candidacy \u2014 are fairly cut-and-dried. But what does the document mean by \u201cnatural born Citizen\u201d?\n\nThe original Constitution doesn\u2019t specify, but both courts and lawmakers have weighed in since the founding. The first piece of evidence is the 14th Amendment, which was enacted after the Civil War to ensure that formerly enslaved Black Americans and their children were recognized as citizens.\n\n\u201cAll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof,\u201d the amendment states, \u201care citizens of the United States.\u201d\n\nThe 14th Amendment establishes what is commonly referred to as \u201cbirthright citizenship\u201d \u2014 that if a person is born on American soil, then there is nothing else they need to do to become a fully-fledged citizen of the United States. Supreme Court cases since the passage of the 14th Amendment clarify specifically that those born in America to foreign parents qualify as \u201cnatural born.\u201d\n\nWhether Harris would be an effective president is a matter for the voters to decide in a few months. But as a legal matter, she is absolutely eligible to hold the office. Because Harris was born in the U.S., the citizenship status or birthplace of either of her parents is irrelevant. Even those facts have not been enough to quiet some of the falsehood promoters, who more recently have claimed Harris was not born in the U.S. But her birth certificate was reviewed by The Associated Press, and it confirms that she was born in Oakland.\n\nCan foreign-born candidates serve as president?\n\nHistory has seen cases more complicated than Harris\u2019, with a number of presidential candidates who were not born in one of the 50 states. So does being born outside of the U.S. disqualify candidates from serving as president?\n\nNot necessarily. Take, for example, the late Arizona Senator John McCain, who was the Republican nominee in 2008. McCain was born not in a state, but in the Panama Canal Zone in 1936 while his father was stationed there as a naval officer. However, the Canal Zone was under American control at the time of McCain\u2019s birth. And because the 14th Amendment specifies that citizenship also applies to those \u201csubject to the jurisdiction\u201d of the U.S., McCain was eligible to serve as president.\n\nAt the time, McCain cited as precedent for his eligibility the successful nomination of Sen. Barry Goldwater, the 1964 Republican nominee who was born in 1909 in the Arizona Territory, just a few years before it was admitted to the union as a state.\n\nEven McCain\u2019s main Democratic rivals for the presidency, Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, co-sponsored a resolution in April 2008 asserting that McCain was a \u201cnatural-born citizen\u201d and thus eligible to be president.\n\nMcCain was also likely in the clear because historically, U.S. law has said that someone \u201cborn outside the United States to a U.S. citizen parent (or parents) is a U.S. citizen at birth.\u201d This is the same precedent that, had he been elected president, would likely have applied to U.S. Senator and 2016 candidate Ted Cruz, a Republican representing Texas, who was born in Canada but whose mother was an American citizen by birth.\n\nRace and ethnicity in the background\n\nNo major candidate for the presidency has ever been in serious jeopardy because of the \u201cnatural born citizen\u201d clause, and Harris is no exception.\n\nThe Constitution does not protect her, however, from the same sorts of race-based political attacks that Donald Trump leveled against Obama, a yearslong crusade that came to be known as \u201cbirtherism.\u201d During Obama\u2019s presidency, Trump falsely asserted that Obama wasn\u2019t born in the United States. As has been documented, Obama was born in Hawaii.\n\nNone of the vice president\u2019s high-profile critics, including Trump, are making quite such extreme accusations against Harris. But as with Obama, there is an unspoken, racist implication: This candidate is foreign. They\u2019re not like you and me. They\u2019re anti-American.",

Cooper\n\nHouston Mayor John Whitmire on Thursday officially endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in her bid for the U.S. presidential seat.\n\n\u201cAs the Mayor of Houston, it is my honor to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris for President of the United States,\u201d Whitmire said in a statement Thursday. \u201cHer tough but smart on crime history assures me she is committed to public safety.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe will be the partner I need to improve infrastructure and help Houston recover from recent disasters,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will drive Houston forward and ensure a brighter future for all Americans.\u201d\n\nEndorsement Alert! John Whitmire proudly endorses @KamalaHarris for President of the United States. pic.twitter.com/2Cz1eiLu74 \u2014 John Whitmire (@whitmire_john) August 1, 2024\n\nQuestions were raised last month when Whitmire\u2019s name did not appear on a list of more than 300 Democratic mayors across the U.S. who endorsed Harris for president. The list included former Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner and other current Texas leaders like Austin Mayor Kirk Watson, San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg and Port Arthur Mayor Thurman Bartie.\n\nHis endorsement came on the second day of Harris\u2019s visit to Houston this week. Thursday, she delivered a eulogy for the late U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee at a north Houston church. She was also in Houston July 23, when Whitmire greeted the vice president upon her arrival to the city. During that trip, Harris was briefed on the city\u2019s recovery efforts after Hurricane Beryl and delivered a speech at the American Federation of Teachers national convention.\n\nRELATED: Kamala Harris in Houston on Thursday to speak at teachers union convention\n\nSeveral Houston area lawmakers have pitched in their endorsements of the former prosecutor since President Joe Biden announced he would not seek reelection as president this year.\n\nA survey from the Associated Press last month quickly showed Harris secured the support of enough party delegates within days to become the presidential nominee who will run against former president and Republican candidate Donald Trump.",

        "text": "Donald Trump and Kamala Harris at odds over presidential debate\nTrump and Harris at odds over presidential debate\n\nThe pair will face off for the presidency when the US goes to the polls on 5 November.\n\nBut Mr Trump says the ABC debate has been \"terminated\" by Mr Biden leaving the race - and has instead pushed for himself and Ms Harris to debate on Fox News on 4 September.\n\nThe Harris campaign is pushing for a debate to take place on ABC News on 10 September, in a slot previously scheduled for a debate between President Joe Biden and Mr Trump.\n\nThe disagreement began after President Biden dropped out of the race on 21 July, with Ms Harris immediately becoming favourite to secure the Democratic nomination.\n\nRelive a wild month in US politics in about two minutes\n\nUS TV networks have been negotiating with both campaigns to arrange new dates.\n\nOn Friday night, Mr Trump wrote on his social network Truth Social that he had accepted Fox News' proposal for a debate on 4 September, which is pencilled to take place in Pennsylvania - a key battleground state.\n\nHe wrote that the moderators would be Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum - and that the rules would be similar to his debate with Mr Biden.\n\n\"If for any reason Kamala is unwilling or unable to debate on that date, I have agreed with Fox to do a major Town Hall on the same September 4th evening,\" he wrote.\n\nMr Trump added that the prior agreement has been terminated because Joe Biden is no longer taking part and because his defamation case against the broadcaster would mean there is a conflict of interest.\n\nThe Harris campaign has responded saying the former president is \"running scared\" and is trying to back out of the agreed debate. They said he\u2019s looking to Fox News \u2013 a conservative cable network - to \"bail him out\".\n\n\u201cHe needs to stop playing games and show up to the debate he already committed to on Sept 10,\" Michael Tyler, Harris Campaign communications director said.\n\nMs Harris followed up on social media, saying it is interesting how \u201cany time, any place\u201d becomes \u201cone specific time, one specific safe space\".\n\n\"I\u2019ll be there on September 10th, like he agreed to,\" she wrote.\n\nMs Harris\u2019 team said they are open to discussing further debates but only after the agreed one takes place.\n\nIf and when the next debate does happen it will be keenly watched to see how the two contenders match up.\n\nMs Harris secured enough pledges to become the Democratic nominee on Friday.\n\nDuring a campaign rally in Atlanta on Wednesday, Ms Harris challenged Mr Trump to debate her, saying \u201cif you got something to say, say it to my face\".\n\nThe debate news comes just hours after a report by the Homeland Security Department revealed that the US Secret Service made mistakes in their response to the 6 January attack on the US Capitol.\n\nMs Harris, who was then vice-president-elect, came within 20ft (6m) of a \"viable\" pipe bomb planted outside the Democratic National Committee's headquarters in Washington.\n\nThat bomb - and a similar one found at the Republican National Committee headquarters - were placed near the buildings the night before Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol. It remains unclear who planted both pipe bombs.",

        "text": "US candidate Jill Stein considering vocal Palestine advocates for VP spot\nShortlist of running mates for Green Party candidate includes two Arab Americans from the swing state of Michigan.\n\nUnited States Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein is considering three Palestinian rights advocates, including two Arab Americans, to be her running mate in the elections, her campaign has confirmed.\n\nThe vice president announcement will be made during a livestream rally on Thursday, the Stein campaign told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe candidates are Abed Ayoub, executive director at the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC); Amer Zahr, a Palestinian American activist; and Jacqueline Luqman, a journalist and activist.\n\nAll three have been vocal critics of Israel and the US\u2019s unflinching support for the war on Gaza. Stein, a physician and activist, herself is a longtime supporter of Palestinian rights.\n\nHaving one of the three on the ballot could boost Stein\u2019s chances of tapping into the mass of disaffected voters who have grown angry with the mainstream Democratic Party\u2019s stance on Israel.\n\nWhile Stein\u2019s campaign is a long-shot bid, with US politics dominated by the Republican and Democrat parties, if she wins a significant share of the votes, her campaign may affect the result of the election.\n\nMoreover, Stein\u2019s supporters say they hope that her candidacy could broaden the conversation around Gaza and amplify voters\u2019 concerns with US policy.\n\nWith a Palestine advocate on the ticket, Stein\u2019s candidacy could also force Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, to further contend with the growing frustration with President Joe Biden\u2019s unconditional backing of Israel.\n\nEven with a small percentage of the votes, Stein\u2019s campaign could make a major impression on the election in places like the swing state of Michigan \u2013 home to large Arab- and Muslim-American communities.\n\nBoth Ayoub and Zahr are from Michigan.\n\n\u2018Honoured\u2019\n\nLuqman, Zahr and Ayoub all confirmed to Al Jazeera that they were approached by the campaign and said they were \u201chonoured\u201d to be considered for the position.\n\nAyoub said it is \u201cimportant\u201d that Stein is considering Palestinian rights advocates to be her running mate.\n\n\u201cThis is a critical time. This is a time where the genocide is in front of everybody\u2019s eyes. There\u2019s no hiding from it. And it\u2019s a time where most of the world and many Americans see how complicit and active both parties are in the genocide.\u201d\n\nZahr also said selecting a vocal supporter of Palestinian rights as Stein\u2019s running mate was a \u201csmart choice\u201d by the campaign.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that the genocide in Gaza has dominated the entire presidential campaign,\u201d Zahr told Al Jazeera.\n\nWhile Biden dropped out after growing concerns over his age following a disastrous debate performance in May, Zahr said the Democratic president\u2019s coalition \u201cwas falling apart\u201d because of the war on Gaza.\n\nLuqman said opposing the war on Gaza should not be a campaign issue, but a human issue. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as lesser evil. Evil is evil, and genocide is evil,\u201d she told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe US-backed Israeli offensive in Gaza has killed at least 39,550 people, levelled large parts of the territory and brought its more than two million inhabitants to the verge of starvation.\n\nGaza and the elections\n\nWhile foreign policy is not usually a major factor in US elections, the war on Gaza has increasingly become a decisive issue in the presidential race.\n\nArabs, Muslims, young people and progressives have expressed anger at Biden\u2019s support for the war. And while it remains unclear how the issue will play out following the US president\u2019s withdrawal from the race and endorsement of Harris, some communities have shown willingness to break with Democrats over Gaza.\n\nPredominantly Arab neighbourhoods in places like the Detroit suburb of Dearborn voted overwhelmingly for Biden against former President Donald Trump in 2020, helping him win Michigan.\n\nBut with the war in Gaza, support for Biden dropped sharply in Arab-American communities, according to public opinion polls.\n\nThe US administration has signed off on at least $14bn in additional military aid to Israel and vetoed three United Nations Security Council proposals that would have called for a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nThe White House has said that Harris has been a \u201cfull partner\u201d in shaping Gaza policy. Still, the vice president has expressed greater empathy for Palestinian suffering while still pledging \u201cunwavering commitment\u201d to Israel.\n\nHarris, who is set to become the Democratic candidate to take on Trump in November after securing enough delegates to win the nomination, has not selected a running mate.\n\nBut Palestinian rights advocates are pushing against a rumoured frontrunner for the position \u2013 Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, who earlier this year compared Gaza solidarity protesters on college campuses to the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nIn 2021, Shapiro \u2013 as Pennsylvania\u2019s attorney general \u2013 also backed sanctions against Ben & Jerry\u2019s after the ice cream company decided to stop doing business in the Israeli-occupied West Bank over ethical concerns.\n\nOpposition to Shapiro grew this week after The Philadelphia Inquirer unearthed a 1993 college newspaper op-ed, in which Shapiro played down the prospect of solving the conflict after White House talks between then-Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.\n\n\u201cPalestinians will not coexist peacefully,\u201d Shapiro wrote in the article. \u201cThey do not have the capabilities to establish their own homeland and make it successful even with the aid of Israel and the United States. They are too battle-minded to be able to establish a peaceful homeland of their own.\u201d\n\nWhy run?\n\nAs Democrats rally around Harris, they have portrayed Trump as an existential threat to US democracy.\n\nDemocratic officials have also accused Stein of helping the former president by taking progressive votes despite not having a realistic chance of winning.\n\nStein ran for president in 2012, 2016 and 2020 but never mounted a competitive campaign.\n\nLuqman, Ayoub and Zahr all said Stein\u2019s bid was about giving the voters a choice and challenging the monopoly of the two major parties on US politics.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t engage in the franchise of voting \u2026 only to vote for candidates who are guaranteed to win,\u201d Luqman told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cWe are supposed to exercise that right however we choose. And if the two major parties offered nothing for the people, then the people should have a right to cast their vote for candidates who they believe reflect their values.\u201d\n\nAyoub echoed that comment.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t go forward with politics as usual in this country. We can\u2019t allow the Democrats and Republicans to continue to play our communities, give false promises, allow for genocide and keep things as [they are],\u201d Ayoub told Al Jazeera.\n\nFor his part, Zahr said Stein\u2019s campaign can build awareness and help increase support for third-party candidates in the future.\n\n\u201cAs long as we say, \u2018Hey, third parties are a wasted vote\u2019, we perpetuate this system,\u201d Zahr told Al Jazeera. \u201cBy the way, this system with a liberal democratic president got us a US-funded genocide \u2013 not even with a right-wing president.\u201d",

        "text": "Harris rejects Trump's idea to debate her on FOX with live audience\nRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump proposed to debate Democratic U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris on Fox News on September 4, and the Harris campaign said Trump is trying to back out of a debate that had been set to run on ABC.\n\nThe rules would be similar to the first debate with President Joe Biden, who has since dropped his reelection bid, Trump said in a post on Truth Social late Friday. But this time it would have a \"full arena audience\" and take place in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, Trump said.\n\nTrump and Biden had agreed to a second debate on September 10 on ABC News which the former president had suggested should be moved to Fox, the most popular network with his followers.\n\nHarris, who on Friday secured the delegate votes needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for the November 5 election, said Saturday that she plans to participate in the originally planned debate.\n\n\"It's interesting how 'any time, any place' becomes 'one specific time, one specific safe space,'\" she wrote on social media platform X. \"I'll be there on Sept. 10, like he agreed to. I hope to see him there.\"\n\nTrump 'running scared,' says Harris camp\n\nHarris spokesperson Michael Tyler said Trump is \"running scared\" and that her campaign is happy to discuss further debates after the September 10 one that \"both campaigns have already agreed to.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Trump said on Truth Social that Harris is \"afraid to do it\" and that he will see her on September 4, \"or I won't see her at all.\"\n\nOn Friday he said that the ABC debate had been \"terminated\" in that Biden would no longer be in it and because he himself was in litigation with ABC.\n\nABC on July 26 outlined qualification requirements for the debate but did not mention any candidates by name.\n\nRequirements include proving polling support and state ballot access by September 3.\n\nRecent polls show a tight contest between Harris and Trump, who had enjoyed a bigger lead over Biden after the first debate.\n\nABC News had no comment about whether Trump had dropped out of the debate, a spokesperson said.\n\nFox News did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump's proposal for the debate on Fox came right after the Democratic National Committee launched an advertising campaign Friday taunting him by saying \"the convicted felon is afraid to debate\" and questioning whether that is due to his stance on abortion.\n\nDavid Plouffe, an adviser to former President Barack Obama who recently joined the Harris campaign, posted on social media: \"Now, he seems only comfortable in a cocoon, asking his happy place Fox to host a Trump rally and call it a debate. Maybe he can only handle debating someone his own age.\"\n\nTrump is 78 and Harris is 59.\n\nFormer Democratic President Jimmy Carter, who turns 100 on Oct. 1, said, \"I'm only trying to make it to vote for Kamala Harris,\" the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Saturday.",

But the conservative supermajority on the U.S. Supreme Court has handed her a lot of work to do.\n\nLast month, a six-justice majority delivered Trump a significant victory, ruling that he deserved substantial immunity from prosecution for official acts he took in the White House, including his efforts to get Department of Justice leaders to back his bogus claims of election fraud in 2020.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nLegal experts say Chutkan will need to review evidence at the heart of the historic four-count felony case, to determine whether other alleged actions by Trump get constitutional protection as official steps of a president, or whether they instead count as personal acts of a candidate seeking political office.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to the charges and has decried all four criminal cases against him as election interference. The current president, Joe Biden, has said he had no role in any of the prosecutions, and Attorney General Merrick Garland affirmed that stance in testimony to Congress.\n\nThere\u2019s no chance Trump will face trial in Washington before this November\u2019s election. The Supreme Court decision means Trump or special counsel Jack Smith could appeal any of the lower court\u2019s determinations about what counts as an official act -- before a jury is even seated in the case.\n\nIf Trump prevails at the ballot box this year, he could order his Justice Department to dismiss the D.C. case or attempt to pardon himself.",

        "text": "Harris\u2019 campaign raised massive $310 million in July as she looks to reset the race against Trump\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 campaign announced Friday that it raised $310 million last month, an eyepopping sum showing that donors who once seemed spooked about the prospects for November\u2019s election with President Joe Biden are now offering mountains of cash to boost his former No. 2.\n\nThe haul by Harris, the Democratic National Committee and affiliated entities far outpaced Republican former President Donald Trump, whose campaign and assorted committees said they took in $138.7 million for July.\n\nWATCH: Why the Harris campaign and Democrats are leaning into calling Trump \u2018weird\u2019\n\nThe vice president\u2019s campaign also says it entered August with $377 million in cash on hand, which it described as the most for any presidential candidate at this point in the cycle. It was also well above the $327 million Trump\u2019s team announced having to start the month.\n\n\u201cThe tremendous outpouring of support we\u2019ve seen in just a short time makes clear the Harris coalition is mobilized, growing, and ready to put in the work to defeat Trump this November,\u201d Harris campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said in a statement. \u201cOur money is going to the work that wins close elections.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s totals for July were augmented by an assassination attempt against the former president during a rally in Pennsylvania, which galvanized some of his fiercest supporters, and by his subsequent revealing of his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\n\nHarris\u2019 team, meanwhile, is hoping for another jolt early next week, when she\u2019s expected to announce her own running mate, and during the Democratic convention, which opens in Chicago on Aug. 19.\n\nThe figures released by both campaigns this week do not include full Federal Elections Commission fillings, which will come later this month. That makes it difficult to determine how much of Harris\u2019 haul came after Biden announced on July 21 that he was abandoning his reelection bid and endorsing Harris.\n\nThat decision followed weeks of some top Democratic donors, as well as dozens of members of Congress, urging the 81-year-old president to step aside after his dismal debate performance on June 27.\n\nStill, Harris\u2019 team had previously announced that it took in more than $200 million during her first week as a presidential candidate, meaning that the lion\u2019s share of July\u2019s strong haul came after the vice president took over the top of the ticket. She is looking to reset the race against Trump, stepping up her travel schedule and sharply criticizing the Republican nominee as she leans more heavily into telling her personal and professional story.\n\nThe vice president is set to become her party\u2019s formal presidential nominee through virtual voting by Democratic convention delegates, set to conclude Monday.\n\nHer campaign said that two-thirds of its July donations came from first-time contributors in the 2024 election cycle. In all, the month saw more than 3 million donors make more than 4.2 million contributions \u2014 with more than 2 million donors making their first donation this cycle, while 94 percent of July\u2019s donations were under $200.\n\nThe campaign said 60 percent of its donors in July were women as Harris prepares to be the first woman of color to be nominated for president by a major political party.\n\nSince her presidential campaign began, Harris\u2019 fundraising has been bolstered by virtual fundraisers organized around supporters of distinct backgrounds including Black Women for Harris, Latinas for Harris and even a White Dudes for Harris. Together they raised more than $20 million, her campaign said.\n\nFundraising aside, the Harris campaign said that by last weekend it had signed up 170,000 new volunteers and held 2,300 events mobilizing thousands of supporters across battleground states.",

        "text": "The DNC's virtual roll call to nominate Kamala Harris started Aug. 1. Here's how the vote works.\nUpdate: The Democratic Party announced on Friday, Aug 2., that Kamala Harris has received enough delegate votes to secure the presidential nomination. Read more here.\n\nDemocratic Party delegates began voting in a virtual roll call on Thursday morning, Aug. 1, to select their new nominee, part of the process to formally elevate Vice President Kamala Harris to the top of the ticket for November. Harris is running unopposed, since no other candidate met the requirements to qualify. Here's more on what it means and how the vote will work:\n\nWho gets to vote?\n\nThe nearly 4,000 pledged delegates allocated during the Democratic primary process will be voting on the nomination.\n\nDo Biden's delegates automatically go to Harris?\n\nThe vast majority of the party's delegates were pledged to President Biden before he dropped out and endorsed Harris. These delegates weren't automatically assigned to Harris, but within the 48 hours of her campaign launch, an overwhelming majority of the delegates said they would back her.\n\nIs anyone challenging Kamala Harris for the Democratic nomination?\n\nUnder DNC rules, Harris' presidential campaign \u2014 and anyone seeking to challenge her \u2014 had to file paperwork with the DNC and obtain digital signatures from at least 300 delegates, with no more than 50 from a single state, by July 30 at 6 p.m. ET.\n\nNo challenger met that threshold to contest Harris' nomination; instead, the most likely figures quickly backed her nomination. At this point, she is the presumptive nominee, and the vote is largely ceremonial.\n\nIn the days since Mr. Biden dropped out and endorsed her, Harris has won endorsements from more than 3,000 of the 4,000 pledged delegates. She ended up with 3,923 delegate signatures during the qualifying period. The number of delegate votes she needs in the virtual roll call to secure the nomination is 1,976.\n\nHow will the DNC's virtual roll call work?\n\nThe committee's rules established that if only one candidate qualified, the party would hold a roll call vote virtually as soon as Aug. 1 \u2014 not in person at its mid-August convention in Chicago.\n\nParty leaders announced Tuesday night that delegates would be able to vote electronically beginning at 9 a.m. ET on Thursday, Aug. 1. The voting will conclude at 6 p.m. ET on Monday, Aug. 5.\n\nDelegates are voting through an online platform run by the DNC, using a personalized and watermarked form sent over email. They can either send the form back or have the DNC call them to cast their vote. Ballots are being sent on a rolling basis, and the process is expected to take several days. Once the votes are in, the DNC will tally them and share the full results after the roll call is closed.\n\n\"Each roll call form has a range of security features to establish the authenticity and accuracy of each vote. Clear instructions and technical support will be provided to delegates,\" the DNC has said.\n\nThe process for the virtual roll call and the gathering of delegate signatures largely mirrors the process used in 2020, during the pandemic.\n\nAutomatic delegates or \"superdelegates,\" such as Democratic governors, members of Congress and former presidents, also have a vote in the signature threshold and the roll call process. The DNC says because Harris got the verified support of a majority of pledged delegates, the votes of both pledged delegates and superdelegates will count on the first ballot of the virtual roll call.\n\nThe DNC said it will share the full results of the roll call after it is completed, but it's unclear when or whether they will make an announcement once Harris passes the threshold needed to secure a majority of delegates.\n\nWill Harris and her running mate be nominated at the same time?\n\nWhile the DNC has said that option is possible, the vice presidential candidate does not have to be nominated at the same time as the presidential nominee. Harris must pick a running mate by Aug. 7 to comply with Ohio's current ballot deadline, which remains in effect. Harris' team is planning to finish the vetting of the VP field and expects her to pick her running mate by Aug. 5, sources familiar with the process say.\n\nSometime after Harris makes her pick, Moore will declare her choice the nominee. There is no separate vote on the vice presidential pick. At the in-person convention in Chicago, there will be ceremonial votes for Harris and her running mate, but the ticket will have been established by then.\n\nWhy is the DNC holding an early virtual roll call vote before the convention?\n\nIn May, the DNC made a push for a virtual process because of Ohio's Aug. 7 deadline for major parties to submit the names of their certified candidates for the November ballot.\n\nWhile Ohio Republicans passed a law to push that deadline to Sept. 1, it will not go into effect until then. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, says Ohio would honor that Sept. 1 deadline. But the DNC and members say the possibility of legal challenges by other outside groups, such as the conservative Heritage Foundation, creates unnecessary risk.\n\n\"If we take chances with state processes and deadlines, Republican groups could make the argument to challenge Democratic votes on the post-election side, arguing that our nominee should never have been on the ballot in the first place,\" said DNC outside counsel Pat Moore.",

And so Democrats and people who are on the outside have a tendency to underestimate him, because he has misspellings in his tweets and he\u2019s very emotional and he doesn\u2019t know anything about policies.\n\n\u201cBut he does touch a chord in the American public.\u201d\n\nClark was speaking to the One Decision podcast, hosted by the journalist Julia Macfarlane and Sir Richard Dearlove, a former head of the British MI6 intelligence service.\n\nA tumultuous presidential election now pits Trump against Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice-president, after Joe Biden, 81, heeded calls to step aside for a younger candidate.\n\nHarris, 59, has enjoyed a surge of support, fundraising and positive polling.\n\nClark, 79, was Nato supreme allied commander, Europe, before retiring in 2000. He ran for the Democratic nomination in 2004, withdrawing after being outperformed in southern states, the basis of his planned challenge to George W Bush.\n\nSpeaking to One Decision, Clark said Trump, 78, retained his strong connection with the US public in part through playing on \u201ca chord of grievance\u201d about foreign wars.\n\nClark ran for president during wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Trump, he said, tapped into a distrust fed by those conflicts but which \u201cgoes back really to the aftermath of the war in Vietnam, which he didn\u2019t fight in, by the way, which he escaped with a spurious bone spur [note] from a doctor\u201d.\n\nAs a young soldier, Clark was severely wounded in Vietnam. Shot four times, he was awarded the Silver Star.\n\nHe continued: \u201cBut the point is, [Trump is] not to be underestimated as a politician. And I think a lot of the problems that President Biden had are traceable to Donald Trump, in foreign policy.\u201d\n\nClark cited the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, after Trump reached an agreement with the Taliban, but left Biden to end a 20-year US military presence with a chaotic evacuation.\n\nFor presidents, Clark said, foreign policy \u201calmost always\u201d produces a \u201ccrisis within the first year\u201d. Asked what challenges might await the next president, Clark identified \u201cmanaging China\u201d, maintaining Europe and Nato as partners in the face of Russian aggression and organising an alliance in opposition to Iran.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some of my friends tell me they\u2019ve already got five or six nuclear weapons. They\u2019re just waiting to test \u2026 and so this is going to be probably the first crisis that a President Kamala Harris has to face when she comes into office.\u201d\n\nFor that to happen, Harris and her as yet unnamed running mate must defeat Trump and his vice-presidential pick, JD Vance, a 39-year-old former marine turned hard-right Ohio senator.\n\nClark was asked about Trump\u2019s appeal to military veterans and voters, given proliferating reports of his remarks belittling service and sacrifice.\n\n\u201cI think Trump comes in with an advantage for the veterans vote simply because he\u2019s masculine,\u201d Clark said. \u201cHe \u2026 talks tough, and so a certain number of people will like that. [But] I can tell you support among the senior officer corps is maybe 5%, or maybe less, because people have seen him and worked for him up close.\n\n\u201cI have no respect for him whatsoever. He doesn\u2019t care about the facts, doesn\u2019t care about the concepts, doesn\u2019t learn, doesn\u2019t listen. [He\u2019s] not somebody who can be trusted with national security secrets. He\u2019s a security threat, etc, etc.\n\n\u201cBut you also have a divergence in the ranks of veterans because you have a number of African Americans and minority members. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to be inclined to vote for Mr Trump. So, hard to say, but my guess is the veterans vote on the whole will be maybe 55 to 60% against Trump.\u201d\n\nAsked if he thought the US military was ready to accept Harris as a female commander-in-chief, Clark said simply: \u201cSure. There\u2019s no problem there.\u201d",

        "text": "'US Election Nostradamus' reveals why Trump's 'disastrous pick' JD Vance would be a \u2018horror show\u2019\nProfessor Allan Lichtman, a forecaster dubbed as the 'Nostradamus' of US presidential elections, shared his thoughts on how Ohio Senator JD Vance might influence the outcome of the 2024 battle between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. US elections: Allan Lichtman claims on his YouTube channel that Vance would be a \u201chorror show\u201d if Trump were incapacitated and he had to take over as president.(Allan Lichtman/YouTube/AP)\n\nThe American University professor Lichtman has correctly predicted the outcome of almost every presidential election since 40th President Ronald Reagan's victory in 1984.\n\nUS VP choice \u2018incredibly important\u2019 but Vance is a \u2018disastrous pick\u2019: Lichtman\n\nLichtman claims on his YouTube channel that Vance would be a \u201chorror show\u201d if Trump were incapacitated and he had to take over as president.\n\nWhile stressing that vice presidential selection doesn't always swing the election, he called VP choice \u201cincredibly important\u201d. \u201cThat's why JD Vance was such a disastrous pick; he would be a horror show as president.\u201d\n\nThe purpose of choosing a running mate, according to him, is to have a successor in case the president steps down or dies, which has happened nine times in US history.\n\nSpeaking to Newsweek, he said Vance poses a challenge because his \u201cviews are even more extreme\u201d than those of Trump.\n\n\u201cFor example, on aid to Ukraine or wanting a national prohibition on abortion with no exception for rape, incest, or health of the mother. And Vance has become a lightning rod for criticism,\u201d he stated.\n\nAlso Read: Trump says JD Vance \u2018feels family is good\u2019 amid \u2018childless cat ladies' row\n\nHere's what Lichtman's model has to say on Kamala Harris\n\nThe Lichtman's model, which takes into account thirteen points, or \u201ckeys\u201d, currently projects that Harris is on the course of victory. Harris, who is scheduled to reveal her vice presidential candidate on Monday, has experienced an increase in her poll numbers.\n\nThe fresh impetus given to Harris' campaign might help her in a number of ways, such as reducing the number of voters who support third-party candidate Robert Kennedy Jr, Lichtman told C-SPAN.\n\nHe added that Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race and Harris' bid for the White House have a \u201cmixed\u201d impact. \u201cBut it doesn't fundamentally change my assessment that a lot would have to go wrong for the Democrats to lose.\u201d\n\nLichtman further announced that he will release his formal election forecast after Democratic convention.\n\n\u201cI plan to make my official prediction in August after the Democratic convention. See my assessment below on the 13 Keys Tracker on where The Keys stand NOW,\u201d he wrote on X.",

        "text": "How an Elon Musk PAC is using voter data to help Trump beat Harris in 2024 election\nIn this article TSLA Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nElon Musk, Chief Executive Officer of SpaceX and Tesla and owner of X speaks during the Milken Conference 2024 Global Conference Sessions at The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California, U.S., May 6, 2024. David Swanson | Reuters\n\nIf a voter in Michigan performs a search on Google , a somewhat shocking ad might pop up. The ad shows a young man lying in bed late at night when someone else texts him, \"Hey you need to vote,\" and then sends the man a video of the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump. The man can hear the gunshots and people screaming in the background. As Trump is rushed off stage with blood pouring down his face, the man watching the video types in response, \"This is out of control. How do I start?\" The ad then displays a website for a group called America PAC. The website says it will help the viewer register to vote. But once a user clicks \"Register to Vote,\" the experience he or she will have can be very different, depending on where they live. If a user lives in a state that is not considered competitive in the presidential election, like California or Wyoming for example, they'll be prompted to enter their email addresses and ZIP code and then directed quickly to a voter registration page for their state, or back to the original sign-up section. But for users who enter a ZIP code that indicates they live in a battleground state, like Pennsylvania or Georgia, the process is very different. Rather than be directed to their state's voter registration page, they instead are directed to a highly detailed personal information form, prompted to enter their address, cellphone number and age. If they agree to submit all that, the system still does not steer them to a voter registration page. Instead, it shows them a \"thank you\" page. So that person who wanted help registering to vote? In the end, they got no help at all registering. But they did hand over priceless personal data to a political operation. Specifically, a political action committee created by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, one aimed at giving the Republican presidential nominee Trump an advantage in his campaign against Vice President Kamala Harris, the de facto Democratic nominee. \"I have created a PAC, or a super PAC ... the America PAC,\" Musk said in a recent interview. Musk also owns the social media platform X, and has a net worth of more than $235 billion, according to Forbes. The combination of owning a social media company that gives him an enormous platform to push his political views, and creating a PAC with effectively unlimited resources, has made Musk, for the first time, a major force in an American presidential election.\n\nMusk PAC uses 'register to vote' data\n\nThe America PAC has spent more than $800,000 since early July on digital ads that target voters in the key battleground states of Arizona, Michigan, Georgia, North Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, according to AdImpact. The ads appeared on Facebook, Instagram and Google through YouTube, and many encouraged people to register to vote at America PAC's website. The PAC's effort to collect information from people using the idea of \"voter registration\" is a critical piece to its plan to make personal contact with these voters. \"America PAC is focusing on door-to-door canvassing in support of Trump,\" said Brendan Fischer, a deputy executive director at campaign finance watchdog Documented. \"I think it is safe to assume that the voter data gathered through these digital appeals are going to inform America PAC's canvassing and other political activities,\" he added. Fischer pointed to the group's privacy policy which says it can use the data they've collected on \"other activities and/or fundraising campaigns.\" Since June, America PAC has spent more than $21 million on canvassing, digital media, text message services and phone calls, according to Federal Election Commission filings. The PAC's website offers no indication one way or another what the group's political leaning is. But in its federal filings, the group discloses that all of its work is designed to either help Trump or hurt his opponent. Fischer said he has seen some other PACs try to use a \"register to vote\" message to gather people's data. But what is unique about America PAC's project is who is backing it and the timing of its creation. In most cases, super PACs are not allowed to directly coordinate the ads they pay for with the campaign. But this spring, regulators ruled that door-to-door canvassing falls outside the scope of the ban because, unlike an ad, it is a person-to-person exchange. \"What makes America PAC more unique: it is a billionaire-backed super PAC focused on door-to-door canvassing, which it can conduct in coordination with a presidential campaign,\" Fischer said. \"Thanks to a recent FEC advisory opinion, America PAC may legally coordinate its canvassing activities with the Trump campaign \u2014 meaning, among other things, that the Trump campaign may provide America PAC with the literature and scripts to make sure their efforts are consistent.\" \"Coordination is incredibly important: it ensures that the PAC's activities are maximally beneficial to the campaign, and frees up the campaign's own funds for other uses,\" he said. \"I suspect that the PAC's ability to coordinate its data-driven canvassing activities with the Trump campaign made it very appealing for donors.\" Longtime Republican strategists Phil Cox, Generra Peck and Dave Rexrode are among those now guiding the PAC after a shake-up in mid-July, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. This person was granted anonymity to speak freely about a private matter. The change suggests there could be a shift in tactics by the PAC come November. The New York Times first reported on the moves.\n\nMusk is not the only tech executive backing this effort. The America PAC raised more than $8 million between April 1 and June 30, according to FEC records. It has received donations from veteran investor Doug Leone, cryptocurrency investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, and a company run by longtime venture capitalist Joe Lonsdale, according to FEC records. Lonsdale, a co-founder of the software company Palantir, is also a leader of the PAC, and \"serves as a political confidant to\" Musk, according to the Times. The records do not yet list Musk as a donor. He recently said on X that he is \"making some donations to America PAC,\" but did not say how much. The PAC is not required to file a third-quarter report until Oct. 15, the first time that Musk's name could be listed as a donor. A spokesman for America PAC declined to comment. Musk did not return emails seeking comment.\n\nMusk on X mirrors Musk PAC",

        "text": "August 4, 2024, presidential campaign news\nIndependent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attends a press conference in New York on May 1. Eduardo Munoz/Reuters\n\nIndependent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in a video posted to social media on Sunday that he once drove a dead bear cub carcass from upstate New York and placed it in New York\u2019s Central Park 10 years ago. Kennedy also said the New Yorker had contacted his campaign about the incident for an upcoming article.\n\nIn the video, posted to his X account, Kennedy tells actress Roseanne Barr that he was traveling through New York\u2019s Hudson Valley to go hawking and came across a \u201cyoung bear\u201d that had been hit and killed by another driver. He says in the video he decided to put the dead bear in his car.\n\n\u201cI pulled over and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van because I was gonna skin the bear,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was in very good condition and I was gonna put the meat in my refrigerator.\u201d\n\nKennedy then tells Barr that he spent the day hawking before driving to New York City for a dinner with the bear still in his car. At the end of the dinner, Kennedy said, he had to go to the airport and couldn\u2019t take the bear back to his home. He said he broached the idea to friends of taking the bear to Central Park and making it appear as if a biker had hit it.\n\n\u201cI had an old bike in my car that somebody had asked me to get rid of and I said let\u2019s go put the bear in Central Park and we\u2019ll make it look like he got hit by a bike,\u201d Kennedy says in the video, prompting laughs from Barr and others in the room not visible in the video. \u201cEverybody thought, \u2018That\u2019s a great idea.\u2019 So we did that and we thought it would be amusing for whoever found it or something.\u201d\n\nKennedy said the bear\u2019s discovery appeared on \u201cthe front page of every paper,\u201d drawing media coverage and prompting investigations from law enforcement, which he said \u201cworried\u201d him because he\u2019d left behind fingerprints. Kennedy suggested he was not blamed for the incident at the time.\n\n\u201cLuckily, the story died down after a while and it stayed dead for a decade. The New Yorker somehow found out about it, and they just \u2013 they\u2019re gonna do a big article on me and that\u2019s one of the articles. So they asked me, the fact checkers\u201d he said.\n\nKennedy appeared to acknowledge the upcoming story may portray him in a negative light.\n\n\u201cYou know, it\u2019s gonna be a bad story,\u201d he said while laughing.\n\nSome of the details Kennedy describes in the video appear to align with an October 2014 incident in which a dead bear cub was discovered in Central Park, attracting media coverage from major news outlets around the country. The woman who discovered the bear told reporters at the time that she found it with its head resting on a bike.",

        "text": "Boosts in Democratic excitement help Harris reset the race against Trump \u2014 CBS News poll\nBoosted by Democrats, younger and Black voters becoming more engaged and likely to vote, and by women decidedly thinking she'd favor their interests more, Vice President Kamala Harris has reset the 2024 presidential race.\n\nShe has a 1-point edge nationally \u2014 something President Biden never had (he was down by 5 points when he left the race) \u2014 and Harris and former President Donald Trump are tied across the collective battleground states.\n\nLooking ahead, voters are also defining why the next few weeks could be critical.\n\nOn one hand, Harris has additional edges with the wider electorate that Mr. Biden did not: she's leading Trump on being seen as having the cognitive health to serve, a measure that was of course central to the campaign before Mr. Biden stepped aside.\n\nAnd on policy generally, Harris is seen as a little different from Mr. Biden, opening some possibility of defining her stances for the electorate now, either way.\n\nBut to Trump's advantage, some critical things have not changed: he keeps his sizable lead on voters saying they'll be financially better off with him and that his policies would decrease migrants at the border.\n\nThe percentage of Democrats who say they'll \"definitely vote\" has risen to its highest point this year. That narrows the partisan \"turnout gap\" we've seen throughout the campaign.\n\nAnd today much higher numbers of Black voters say they'll vote, compared to July when Mr. Biden was the nominee.\n\nMore generally, all this points to how the election might well hinge on turnout and specifically on marginal-turnout voter \u2014 those who don't always show up to vote.\n\nFor example, among those who generally describe themselves as \"sometimes\" or \"rarely\" voting \u2014 but say they'll definitely vote now \u2014 Harris is currently winning.\n\nThe women's vote\n\nHarris is leading among women voters \u2014 an edge Democrats have had and needed in recent history \u2014 with at least one big reason why: Women voters overwhelmingly think Harris would help women's interests if elected. Far fewer women say that about Trump.\n\nVoters overall tend to think Trump would help the interests of men more than they think he'd help those of women.\n\nRelated to this, the gender gap has widened some from earlier in the campaign. Harris leads Trump among women by a bigger margin than Mr. Biden had, while holding roughly the same support Mr. Biden had among men.\n\nEnthusiasm and core Democratic groups\n\nMost Democratic voters, and nearly half of voters overall, say that Harris as the Democratic nominee makes them feel more motivated to vote. (There is some countering effect, too: about a third of Trump voters are also more motivated to vote now that Harris is the nominee.)\n\nIt's not just that Democrats are more excited, but also on a number of candidate qualities they feel they've gotten a candidate that can match up more closely with Trump.\n\nHarris has an advantage over Trump on being seen as having the mental and cognitive health to serve, which was a critical deficit for Mr. Biden.\n\nAcross the wider set of voters, she's ahead of Trump on being energetic and focused (two qualities Mr. Biden trailed Trump badly on). She's even with Trump on perceived competence, and closer than Mr. Biden was on being tough and effective.\n\nBlack voters\n\nHarris now has levels of support among Black voters that is closer to what Mr. Biden had in 2020 and higher than Mr. Biden was getting in polling this year.\n\nBlack voters think Harris will look out for everyone, including Black people.\n\nRepublicans and Trump voters think Harris will help the interests of Black people more so than of White people; Harris' voters think she'll look out for everyone across gender and race lines.\n\nTrump's voters also think he'll help the interests of everyone, though the wider electorate tends to think he'll help the interests of men and White people more so than others.\n\nMore widely, as voters assess where the country is, most say the country is ready to elect a Black woman as president, and that spans people voting for Harris and many who are not. It includes about three-quarters of independents and almost half of Republicans.\n\nFor some historical context, the 21st century has brought a shift in these kinds of views; back in 2000 just over a third had thought the nation was ready to elect a Black president. That had changed in CBS News polling in 2008 when Barack Obama was running, and then most said the country was ready to do so.\n\nOn policy and issues: What's changed, what's the same?\n\nHarris' policy views are seen as mostly \u2014 but not entirely \u2014 the same as Mr. Biden's, opening the question of how the campaigns may spend the coming weeks looking to define those differences in the public mind.\n\nVoters do see her as somewhat or very liberal. (The more conservative one is, the more likely they are to view her as very liberal.) Then again, voters see Trump as very or somewhat conservative \u2014 and so that choice is more polarized than the electorate as a whole.\n\nOn having policies that will improve people's finances: Harris opens in the same position as Mr. Biden was in July, trailing Trump substantially.\n\nHalf think Harris' policies would increase the number of migrants trying to cross the border, similar to Mr. Biden, but that Trump's would decrease that.\n\nOn protecting abortion: A majority think Harris will try to pass a national law making abortion legal.\n\nHarris has been arguing that Trump will ban abortion nationwide if he gets back into office, but she may have more work to do convincing voters of that. Trump has said he'd leave the matter to the states, and voters are more inclined to think he will do just that.\n\nLooking ahead to the VP pick\n\nOn the whole most Democrats aren't explicitly calling on Harris to pick a man, or to pick a woman as her running mate, and some are thinking strategically that the pick should be from a battleground state.\n\nThe impact of third parties\n\nWith third-party candidates included (though not all are on the ballot in all states), Harris' national lead is similar, at two points.\n\nState-level estimates\n\nIn addition to our national polling, we have updated state-level estimates available for the seven battleground states that are derived from CBS News' statistical model \u2013 which incorporates this survey data as well as multiple other data. All estimates are within the margin of error, further underpinning the larger point of an even race.\n\nThis CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a representative sample of 3,102 registered voters nationwide interviewed between July 30-August 2nd, 2024. The survey included an oversample of Black respondents. The final sample as reported was weighted according to gender, age, race, and education based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as to 2020 presidential vote. Respondents were selected to be representative of registered voters nationwide. The margin of error for registered voters is \u00b12.1 points. Battlegrounds are AZ GA MI NC NV PA WI.\n\nToplines\n\ncbsnews_20240804_SUN by CBSNews.com on Scribd",

        "text": "ABC host reportedly received death threats after Trump interview\nABC News\u2019s senior congressional correspondent, Rachel Scott, has reportedly faced threats to her life after her piercing interview of Donald Trump at the National Association of Black Journalists convention left the former president fuming.\n\nThe NABJ\u2019s executive director told members at a meeting on Saturday that \u201cScott had received death threats following her work asking incisive questions of \u2026 Trump at the group\u2019s national convention\u201d three days earlier, Eric Deggans of National Public Radio wrote in an X post published Saturday.\n\nDeggans did not elaborate, and the Guardian has asked the NABJ, ABC and Scott for comment.\n\nScott asked Trump on Wednesday, \u201cWhy should Black voters trust you?\u201d given his history of inflammatory comments about Black people. Among other questions, she also quizzed him about whether he believed Vice-President Kamala Harris had risen to the top of the Democratic ticket for November\u2019s White House election solely \u201cbecause she is a Black woman\u201d.\n\nTrump replied to Scott by accusing her of being \u201crude\u201d and having presented a \u201cnasty question\u201d. In reference to Harris, who is of Jamaican and Indian descent, he said: \u201cI didn\u2019t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black. And now she wants to be known as Black.\n\n\u201cSo, I don\u2019t know. Is she Indian, or is she Black?\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s comments about Harris drew widespread derision at a time when polls, including one on Sunday from CBS News, show the pair essentially tied in key battleground states. Notably, on Sunday, Senator Lindsey Graham \u2013 one of Trump\u2019s fellow prominent Republicans \u2013 urged him to focus on condemning her policies rather than her heritage.\n\n\u201cEvery day we\u2019re talking about her heritage and not her \u2026 record \u2026 is a good day for her and a bad day for us,\u201d Graham said on Fox News Sunday.\n\nScott\u2019s encounter with Trump added to the former president\u2019s long record of hostility toward reporters. Frequently, he excoriates journalists as unpatriotic enemies of the people, uses his lectern as a platform from which to hurl insults at the press and singles out reporters by name as purveyors of \u201cfake news\u201d \u2013 often in the presence of an irate mob of supporters.\n\nSome in his circle even blamed the failed 13 July assassination attempt targeting Trump on news coverage that was critical of the former president, who just in May was convicted in criminal court of falsifying business records to hide hush-money payments to adult film actor Stormy Daniels.\n\nUnited Nations experts have previously warned that such vitriol from Trump and his supporters \u2013 hundreds of whom attacked the US Capitol after he lost the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden \u2013 enhances the possibilities of violence against the press.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the Washington Post\u2019s Karen Attiah resigned from her position as co-chairperson of the convention\u2019s organizing committee in protest of having Trump address the gathering.\n\nScott moderated Trump\u2019s session on Wednesday at the NABJ convention with co-moderators Harris Faulkner of Fox News and Kadia Goba of Semafor.",

        "text": "2024 US President Election: Donald Trump vs Kamala Harris debate on September 10. What we know so far\n2024 US Presidential Election: Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump proposed debating Democratic candidate and US Vice President Kamala Harris on September 4 on Fox News. However, the Harris campaign claimed that Trump was trying to back out from the debate scheduled on ABC News.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump said the debate rules would be similar to the first with President Joe Biden, who has dropped his candidature from the presidential race. But this time, the debate would take place in the battleground of Pennsylvania with a \u201cfull arena audience\u201d, he said.\n\nDonald Trump vs Kamala Harris: What we know so far 1) The second debate between Trump and Biden was scheduled on September 10 on ABC News, but the former US President suggested it move to Fox News. On Friday, Kamala Harris secured her Democratic nomination for the presidential race.\n\n2) After Donald Trump announced the debate, Harris took to X (formerly Twitter) and wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s interesting how 'any time, any place' becomes \u2018one specific time, one specific safe space\u2019. I\u2019ll be there on Sept. 10, like he agreed to. I hope to see him there.\u201d\n\n3) Trump is running scared and that her campaign is happy to discuss further debates after the September 10 one that both campaigns have already agreed to, said Harris spokesperson Michael Tyler.\n\n4) On the other hand, Trump said Harris is afraid to do it. \u201cI will see her on Sept. 4 or I won't see her at all,\u201d he wrote on Truth Social.\n\nAlso Read | US Elections 2024: Trump agrees to Fox News debate with Harris on September 4\n\n5) Trump suggested moving the debate to Fox shortly after the Democratic National Committee released an ad campaign on Friday. The ad taunted him, labeling him a \"convicted felon afraid to debate\" and speculating that it might be due to his position on abortion.\n\n6) \u201cNow, he seems only comfortable in a cocoon, asking his happy place Fox to host a Trump rally and call it a debate. Maybe he can only handle debating someone his own age,\u201d said David Plouffe, an adviser to former President Barack Obama who recently joined the Harris campaign, posted on social media.",

        "text": "\u2018I\u2019m trying to make it\u2019: Jimmy Carter\u2019s goal is to vote for Kamala Harris\nNearing his 100th birthday and in hospice care since February 2023, the former president Jimmy Carter reportedly has one goal: voting for Kamala Harris against Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m only trying to make it to vote for Kamala Harris,\u201d Carter told his son Chip this week, as his grandson Jason Carter recounted to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nHarris, Carter\u2019s fellow Democrat, will face the Republican Trump for the presidency on 5 November. Carter\u2019s 100th birthday will fall on 1 October.\n\nA Democrat who was in the White House from 1977 to 1981, Carter is the oldest living president. In ill health for several years, his family announced that he entered hospice care on 18 February 2023. Many took that announcement to mean Carter was near the end of his life.\n\nAnd the next month, the current president, Joe Biden, said he had been asked to deliver Carter\u2019s eulogy.\n\nBiden also said Carter\u2019s doctors had \u201cfound a way to keep him going for a lot longer than they anticipated because they found a breakthrough\u201d.\n\nIn October 2023, as the White House celebrated Carter\u2019s 99th birthday, the former Democratic National Committee chairperson Donna Brazile said the former Georgia governor was \u201ca towering, old southern oak \u2026 as good as they come and tough as they come\u201d.\n\nThe following month, Carter\u2019s wife, Rosalynn Carter, died aged 96. The couple, who campaigned for human rights and mental health reform, were married for 77 years, through Jimmy Carter\u2019s time in the US navy, in Georgia state politics, in the White House and in a post-presidency widely regarded as one of the most productive.\n\nIn 2002, Carter was awarded the Nobel peace prize, \u201cfor his decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development\u201d.\n\nIn 2021, he told the Associated Press the secret to a long life was \u201cto marry the right person\u201d.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Jimmy Carter expressed his support for Harris when Chip Carter asked if he was trying to make it to 100.\n\nAs the Journal-Constitution noted, early voting in Georgia begins on 15 October \u2013 two weeks past the former president\u2019s centenarian birthday.",

He has also claimed that Harris not only enjoyed the hospitality, and travel by jet planes but also financial help in cash. The former San Francisco Mayor has also claimed that he has the photograph of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump together on board Trump's jet.Brown also told Politico that while he was speaking at Harvard University, Donald Trump sent his private jet to take his group of friends to Teterboro, New Jersey. He said that though Kamala Harris did not attend the meeting with Trump, he has a photograph showing her with Trump on board the plane. He told 'Politico', \"I have the picture.\"In what may be a more damaging revelation for the vice president now, 'Politico' quoted Brown saying that he arranged a $55,000 cheque signed by Donald Trump when Kamala Harris sought re-election as attorney general of California in 2011.Willie Brown is a 90-year-old Democrat politician who claims to have dated Kamala Harris when she was young.

Biden returned to Washington for the first time after the first presidential debate in Atlanta on June 27. (Photo by Mandel NGAN / AFP)(AFP)\n\nThe charges stemmed from his purchase and possession of a firearm while he was addicted to crack cocaine in October 201812.\n\nHunter Biden became the first child of a sitting president to be convicted of a felony on June 11 when a jury in Wilmington, Delaware, found him guilty on three counts related to his lying about illegal drug use when he purchased a handgun in 2018.\n\nThe trial, which lasted six days, included testimonies from Hunter Biden\u2019s ex-wife, an ex-girlfriend, Hallie Biden (the widow of his deceased brother Beau Biden), and his daughter Naomi Biden1. The jury deliberated for less than three hours before returning a guilty verdict\n\nALSO READ| Joe Biden makes strange comment, tells crowd 'you're stuck with me' for \u2018another\u2026\u2019\n\nThe sentencing by U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika will take place eight days after the Nov. 5 presidential election pitting Vice President Kamala Harris against Republican nominee Donald Trump.\n\nSentencing guidelines for the gun charges are 15 to 21 months, but legal experts say defendants in similar cases often get shorter sentences and are less likely to be incarcerated if they abide by the terms of their pretrial release.\n\nJoe Biden said he had to accept the \u2018outcome\u2019 of his son's case\n\nJoe Biden issued a statement following the verdict saying he accepted the outcome of the case. \u201cAs I said last week, I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cJill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. So many families who have had loved ones battle addiction understand the feeling of pride seeing someone you love come out the other side and be so strong and resilient in recovery.\u201d\n\nBiden further added, \u201cAs I also said last week, I will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal.\u201d\n\nAt the trial, prosecutors offered an intimate view of Hunter Biden\u2019s years of struggle with alcohol and crack cocaine abuse, which they said legally precluded him from buying a gun.\n\nALSO READ| Kamala Harris secures enough votes to clinch Democratic presidential nomination: \u2018I am honored\u2019\n\nBiden\u2019s lawyers sought to show he was not using drugs when he bought the gun and did not intend to deceive because he didn\u2019t consider himself a drug user when he filled out the form.\n\nHunter Biden has also been charged with three felony and six misdemeanour tax offences in California, alleging he failed to pay $1.4 million in taxes between 2016 and 2019 while spending millions on drugs, escorts, exotic cars and other high-ticket items. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges. A trial is scheduled for Sept. 5 in Los Angeles.\n\n{With inputs from wires}",

        "text": "Ask an expert: Pop culture in the 2024 presidential election\nUNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. \u2014 When Kamala Harris announced her candidacy for president, two questions were at the forefront of social media memes: Who would she select for her running mate, and had Maya Rudolph cleared her schedule to reprise her Harris impression for Saturday Night Live?\n\nPolitics permeates pop culture, and vice versa, especially during presidential elections. Penn State News spoke with three faculty experts to learn more about how people can best parse politics in pop culture, as well as how to take care in a saturated media landscape.\n\nWael Jabr, assistant professor of supply chain and information systems at the Penn State Smeal College of Business, studies, among other topics, how social media shapes political discourse.\n\nMichele Ramsey, associate professor of communication art and sciences and of women\u2019s, gender and sexuality studies at Penn State Berks, researches representations of gender in the media as well as rhetoric on women\u2019s rights, social movements and politics.\n\nS. Shyam Sundar, Evan Pugh University Professor and the James P. Jimirro Professor of Media Effects in the Penn State Donald P. Bellisario College of Communications, investigates the uses and effects of digital media, online news sources, fake news and misinformation, social media effects and the social and psychological aspects of artificial intelligence.\n\nQ: Can celebrities and social media influencers like Taylor Swift sway voters? How do influencers compare to the impact of traditional media on politics?\n\nJabr: Celebrities and social media influencers can, and quite often do, sway voters. Some feel an obligation to weigh in on political matters. Others weigh in on social matters that have a strong influence on elections.\n\nWhile we\u2019re used to influencers like Taylor Swift with a huge following of more than a quarter of a billion Instagram users, we\u2019re witnessing more recently a newer type of \u201cmicro-influencer\u201d with a follower base of just a few thousand. These influencers are closer to the pulse of the community. They are interested in local issues, such as potholes on their main street or how to support their local eateries. So, when they make a political statement, it resonates with their followers.\n\nInfluence is a combination of things: the more I hear it, the more valid I believe it is; if I hear it from different sources, that is also impactful. There is also the on-demand feature of social media and its infinite scrolling. These influencers have a megaphone that amplifies information. Take for example this experiment on Twitter in Denmark from a couple years ago. The researchers concluded that when we are repeatedly exposed to an idea, typically from many sources, we are more likely to adopt it and reshare it, what psychologists call the repeated exposure effect.\n\nSundar: Celebrities may not directly tell their fans how to vote, but they can leverage their popularity to shape politics in other ways. They often publicly endorse candidates and platform positions. They can provide star power for political fund-raising events. This can mean a lot in the political process and automatically gives them a voice. For example, when George Clooney wrote an op-ed piece in the New York Times urging President Biden to relinquish his candidacy for the 2024 elections, one of the first things Clooney mentioned was his successful fund-raising efforts for Democratic Party candidates.\n\nQ: How does the personalization of a social media newsfeed skew a person\u2019s perception of political issues?\n\nRamsey: Now that media has become so siloed, meaning that we all see things in our algorithms that reflect and encourage what we already believe and like, our perceptions of cultural and political issues are no longer common. It has always been the case that we have different opinions on the things happening in our country, but we generally shared the same media and thus also a similar reality. Algorithms and their impact on what we see has changed that. We have entire populations that do not even share the same reality. As such, it is not just the case that perceptions of political issues are skewed these days because of social media. Now perceptions of reality itself are skewed \u2014 and in many cases, just plain incorrect.\n\nHow do you talk with someone who doesn\u2019t believe something that is scientifically proven, such as climate change? How do you persuade that person? How do you counteract incorrect information that is being fed to them through an algorithm designed to make money off of their engagement rather than functioning in a way that better protects democracy? Many of the people who created tools that allow for the silo effect of social media now attempt to undo the damage their creation has done; some even formed the Center for Humane Technology to sound warning bells about the impacts of algorithms on our democracy, mental health and relationships.\n\nJabr: Personalization algorithms are intended to give us more of the same \u2014 the same content that we typically like and engage with. So, inherently, with the way social media algorithms work, we may be stuck in echo-chambers, in our own bubbles. Ideally, we should be able to expect that social media platforms and influencers would act ethically and in the interest of social welfare. But frankly, that is a tough ask. This is because social media is most often a numbers game \u2014 number of followers, specifically \u2014 and how to monetize them.\n\nNow, these algorithms are available on social media but not on traditional media. Yet traditional media is also playing a numbers game for viewers, and what they can\u2019t achieve through personalization they make up for through polarizing their reporting. This makes us all, young or old, social media aficionados or traditional media fanatics, prone to becoming siloed and to having our perceptions skewed. One has to recognize these issues to be able to overcome them.\n\nQ: How do politics influence pop culture? How does pop culture influence politics, or the perception of politics?\n\nRamsey: Ideology is most powerful when it\u2019s least visible. When we are being entertained, we are often less likely to critically assess the ideologies about things like race, class and sex/gender, or a specific political issue, because it\u2019s \u201cjust entertainment.\u201d As a result, we may be more easily influenced by a popular song or film narrative than, say, a political advertisement where ideologies are more clearly communicated and expected. We need to understand the ideological power of the media to influence our ideas about who we are, who we want to be and how we see the world.\n\nPopular culture helps shape our views of the world and its politics through what stories we choose to pay attention to in things like television, film, music and social media posts on platforms like TikTok. At the same time, people tasked with the job of making sure politicians are relatable to voters are going to pay attention to popular culture and make attempts to connect themselves to memes, people, trends or whatever else in the media people are paying attention to, whether positive or negative. Conversely, some popular culture can obfuscate issues and confuse people \u2014 unintentionally or purposefully \u2014 and some can shed light on issues and help people see things they didn\u2019t see before, whether those things are true or not.\n\nQ: The election cycle can feel overwhelming, especially as it permeates traditional and social media. What is mindfulness and how might it be applied during the election cycle?\n\nSundar: The election cycle is overwhelming in that it adds to the information overload that social media users are already struggling with on their phones and other devices. This kind of overload situation is known to encourage mindless consumption of information. People may not pay close attention to the sources or veracity of information. They are more likely to fall for fake news. They may not stop to think that their social media friends are not trained in journalism and therefore do not know how to vet or verify facts. So, the solution is not to endlessly scroll through your feeds on your mobile devices, but to be more mindful in consuming political news. One strategy would be to subscribe to a manageable set of professional news sources. If these sources have known political biases, then it would be a good idea to factor that in when consuming information from them. It would also be a good idea to subscribe to a politically diverse set of news sources to gain a better perspective.\n\nJabr: Mindfulness for me starts with trying to break the algorithmic bubble that we can get stuck in. The way to do that is through injecting some randomness in our choices to \u201ctrip\u201d that algorithm. If my views lean to the left or to the right, it helps to click on content from the opposing side, which may lead the algorithm to think I am more centrist.\n\nMindfulness can also be done through setting limits. Because social media allows infinite scrolling, one can keep scrolling for an endless time, so one has to make sure they take breaks.\n\nI also recommend maintaining contact with nature and maintaining social contacts with family and with friends: Take breaks from the media and have walks in the park, attend social events and so on.\n\nFor more information or to speak with one of our election experts, visit media.psu.edu or contact mediarelations@psu.edu.",

        "text": "At the Crossroads: The U.S. Presidential Election and the Future of the Auto Industry\nAt the Crossroads: The U.S. Presidential Election and the Future of the Auto Industry\n\nUncertainties loom about the future of electric vehicles (EVs) versus internal combustion engines (ICEs), investment strategies, policy changes, and foreign investments.\n\n\n\nAs the U.S. presidential election looms this November, the domestic auto industry stands at a crucial crossroads, facing uncertainties about the future of electric vehicles (EVs) versus internal combustion engines (ICEs) and the impact of foreign investments. Foreign automakers are also closely monitoring potential new tariff regimes that could disrupt global supply chains, alter trade dynamics, and affect strategic plans.\n\nLegislative Impacts and Investment Strategies\n\nIn recent years, the U.S. automotive sector has been significantly shaped by legislation like the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and the CHIPS and Science Act. These acts, introduced by the Biden administration, have driven substantial investments in infrastructure expansion, semiconductor capacity building, and clean energy initiatives. A Democratic victory under Kamala Harris would likely continue these targeted investments and subsidies, focusing on transitioning to a green economy. A key component of this transition is sustainable transport, emphasizing EVs, related charging networks, and battery manufacturing facilities.\n\nIncentives aimed at boosting domestic semiconductor manufacturing capabilities have been driven by the need to reduce reliance on Asia-based chip manufacturers. Both Republican and Democratic administrations are expected to support these initiatives, though Republicans might favor U.S. companies like Micron and Intel over East Asian manufacturers like TSMC and Samsung, which have collectively invested around $36 billion in U.S. projects.\n\nDiverging Paths\n\nA Trump administration, known for its climate change skepticism and support for traditional ICEs, could slash funding for clean energy initiatives, jeopardizing the progress of the EV sector. Trump has criticized the current administration\u2019s support for EVs, labeling it a \u201cgreen scam\u201d detrimental to the ICE-focused U.S. auto industry. He has declared his intention to \u201cend the electric vehicle mandate\u201d and roll back policies such as the $7,500 purchase subsidies that support EV adoption. Limiting or ending these subsidies would significantly hinder EV sales at a time when they are struggling to gain a foothold in the U.S. market.\n\nAdditionally, Trump has threatened to impose a 100% tariff on all cars from Chinese-owned manufacturing facilities, regardless of their location. While this aligns with his \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d slogan, it could exacerbate inflationary pressures on U.S. consumers, discouraging them from purchasing higher-priced, domestically made models.\n\nA Republican administration is also poised to ease fuel economy and emissions compliance regulations and challenge roadmaps like California\u2019s, which aim to phase out ICEs and mandate that all new cars and light trucks sold by 2035 be electric or plug-in hybrid. This would slow the transition from ICE to hybrids, battery EVs, and plug-in EVs. Conversely, a Democratic president would likely continue to support EV production and adoption, enforce stricter fuel economy standards, invest in charging networks, and offer tax credits and incentives to make EVs more affordable. Such policies aim to achieve the target of 50% of all new car sales in the U.S. being EVs by 2030.\n\nThe Biden administration\u2019s push for clean energy and job creation has attracted significant foreign investments, including Toyota\u2019s $8 billion plant in North Carolina and Hyundai\u2019s $4 billion project in Georgia. Several states, including Michigan, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Texas, Nevada, and Tennessee, have benefited from new investments in clean energy initiatives. Any attempt by a Trump administration to repudiate these initiatives would harm investment stimulus and job creation, likely facing resistance from these states.\n\nThe Chinese Factor\n\nTariffs on imported vehicles and automotive parts will be a cornerstone of Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda. These tariffs aim to boost domestic manufacturing, protect U.S. automakers from foreign competition, create jobs, and strengthen the U.S. economy. However, this could backfire by increasing production costs for automakers reliant on imported components, leading to higher vehicle prices and dampening consumer demand.\n\nTrade tensions with China remain a significant challenge. President Biden increased tariffs from 25% to 100% on Chinese EVs, raised levies on lithium-ion EV batteries from 7.5% to 25%, and doubled tariffs on semiconductors from 25% to 50%. Although these restrictions, effective August 1st, impact only about $18 billion of Chinese exports to the U.S., a Democratic president is likely to maintain a protectionist stance, especially towards China.\n\nChinese automakers like BYD are seeking to bypass tariffs by establishing facilities in Mexico, raising questions about the USMCA trade agreement, which is up for renewal in 2026. Notably, Democratic nominee Kamala Harris received the endorsement of the United Auto Workers (UAW) Union, partly due to her opposition to the USMCA trade deal.\n\nAt the recent Republican Convention in Milwaukee, Trump expressed a willingness to allow Chinese automakers to build cars in the U.S. and employ American workers, a departure from the Biden administration\u2019s exclusionary stance on vehicles with ties to China. For instance, companies with at least 1/4th Chinese government ownership are considered \u201cforeign entities of concern\u201d and tax credit benefits are disallowed for them. However, Trump warned that if Chinese manufacturers built in Mexico and shipped products across the border, a 200% tax would be imposed. This development bears watching, as it could accelerate the U.S. transition to EVs and provide an entry point for Chinese manufacturers into the market.\n\nBeyond China, Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on trade partners like the EU, potentially resulting in reciprocal tariffs that could harm the competitiveness of U.S. vehicle and parts exports. This could create challenges for U.S. automakers operating in global markets.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs the world awaits the outcome of the U.S. presidential election, the auto industry faces a period of uncertainty. Policy changes could affect product development, sourcing strategies, and investment roadmaps. Both Democrats and Republicans are expected to use economic intervention and tariffs to protect U.S. automotive manufacturing interests from foreign competition. Domestic semiconductor production will receive strong support from both parties. While Democrats will push forward on sustainable EVs and stricter emissions standards, Republicans under Trump will favor conventional fossil fuel-driven cars and eschew fuel economy regulations. Continued investments will be crucial to ensuring the U.S. automotive industry remains competitive on the global stage.\n\nWith inputs from Amrita Shetty, Senior Manager, Communications & Content \u2013 Mobility\n\nAbout Vishwas Shankar Vishwas Shankar is a Director with Frost & Sullivan's Mobility Practice.

Inflation skyrocketed and shortages of basic goods became widespread.\n\nWaves of anti-government protests in 2014 and 2017 fizzled out after a police crackdown.\n\nMillions of Venezuelans left the country to escape economic hardship and political repression. Amid growing discontent, Mr Maduro was re-elected in 2018 in a presidential election widely dismissed as neither free nor fair.",

        "text": "Despite security concerns, TikTok still plays key role in 2024 race\nDespite national security concerns about TikTok \u2013 and its ties to China \u2013 the popular short-form video app is playing an important role on the campaign trail for both former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. The reason, experts say, is because the platform remains a crucial tool for candidates to reach young voters.\n\nTrump joined TikTok in June, where he currently has 9.5 million followers on the platform, more than the 7.47 million followers on his own social media service, Truth Social.\n\nCapitalizing on a sudden surge in popularity on the platform, Harris created a TikTok account on July 25. Harris has amassed more than 4.1 million followers.\n\nOn both of their respective TikTok profiles, the candidates have adopted a unique TikTok style of campaigning, making use of popular background music, editing methods, and collaborations with popular celebrities.\n\nYoung voters\n\n\u201cA huge part of the reason why Joe Biden left the race is because voters thought he was out of touch, he was too old,\u201d said Caitlin Chin-Rothmann, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who researches the impact of technology on geopolitics. \u201cAnd so, I think both Trump and Harris are trying to position themselves as very relevant, especially when it comes to that younger demographic that's harder to reach in general.\u201d\n\nIn one recent 8-second video, Harris is shown shaking hands with members of the USA Men\u2019s Olympic basketball team to the sound of a screaming eagle and the buzz of an electric guitar. Twenty-nine-year-old rapper Megan Thee Stallion calls Harris \u201cthe future president of the United States\u201d in another video on the candidate\u2019s account.\n\nTrump has made videos with famous YouTuber brothers-turned-boxers Jake and Logan Paul, simulating pre-fight confrontations before breaking to hug each of the influencers. The video he filmed with Logan Paul has more than 157 million views.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna save TikTok,\u201d Trump says to the camera while holding a framed portrait of himself. In another video with famous UFC commentator Dana White, Trump describes joining TikTok as his honor.\n\nBeijing backed\n\nTikTok was adapted for overseas use by a Chinese social media platform owned by Beijing-based company ByteDance. Over one-third of American adults, and 62% of adults under 30, reportedly use TikTok, according to a survey from the Pew Research Center.\n\nWhile he was president, Trump issued an executive order attempting to ban TikTok and WeChat, describing the Chinese-originated apps as a threat to American national security given that data collection on the platforms \u201cthreatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans\u2019 personal and proprietary information.\u201d\n\nHowever, in an interview with CNBC in March, Trump said that while he still believes TikTok to be a national security threat, he understands that, if it were banned, a lot of young kids would \u201cgo crazy without it.\u201d\n\nThe former president also argued that a TikTok ban would ultimately benefit Facebook, which he described as \u201can enemy of the people.\u201d After the January 6th Capitol riots, Meta suspended Trump\u2019s Facebook and Instagram accounts for two years.\n\nCiting similar concerns to Trump\u2019s, President Biden approved a bill in April that requires parent company ByteDance to sell the app to remain in the U.S. market. TikTok said it has not and will not share U.S. user data with the Chinese government and has been releasing a series of slick advertisements over the past year as the debate over its ownership has intensified, highlighting the benefit that TikTok provides to American citizens.\n\nUpper hand\n\nArthur Herman, senior fellow and director of the Quantum Alliance Initiative at Hudson Institute, told VOA that although Trump\u2019s and Harris\u2019 decisions to campaign on TikTok are rational given the popularity of the app, American politicking occurring on a Chinese platform gives the Chinese government an upper hand.\n\nHe said that TikTok, which is under the control of the Chinese government, will use its algorithm to influence the election results and \u201cpush one [candidate] who is probably going to be softer on China.\u201d\n\nTikTok denies allegations that it is trying to carry out covert influence operations and has sued the federal government over the law that is forcing it to cut ties with its parent company to keep operating in the United States.\n\nIn May, just a few weeks after the Brookings Institution released a study that said Russian state-media were boosting their use of the platform, the company said it was putting new regulations in place. Those regulations aimed to limit the reach of state media accounts. The company also pledged to release regular updates on what the platform is doing to fight back against covert influence.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nBiden\u2019s withdrawal from the race has left questions regarding the future of TikTok in the United States. Experts argue that even though TikTok\u2019s fate is ultimately left up to the courts, a future president could try to revoke the ban or change the U.S. position toward Chinese companies.\n\n\u201cNo matter who wins the election in November, whether that's Trump or Harris, they don't have to take responsibility for the TikTok ban. Now they can say \u2018that was Biden\u2019s policy, not mine,\u2019\u201d Chin-Rothmann said.\n\nHerman is optimistic that the next president will continue to take actions against TikTok and ByteDance, and expressed hope that the United States will develop an \u201cAmerican version of TikTok.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most important next step is that we need an American TikTok. Let's figure out a way in which to develop that and to turn America into high-tech leadership,\u201d Herman said. He added that is where the real future lies.\n\nKatherine Michaelson contributed to this report.",

        "text": "5 things to know about CBS News' 2024 Battleground Tracker election poll analysis\nThe CBS News Battleground Tracker is back, explaining what's on voters' minds and regularly providing detailed snapshots of the U.S. presidential election in each state throughout the 2024 campaign. In addition to the specific polls we conduct in key states in a given week, the Battleground Tracker map includes our best estimates and presidential race ratings in every state. This includes states we've polled extensively and states where we've surveyed fewer voters but have lots of other data. Scroll down to the end to see CBS News' latest battleground state estimates (you can also hover over the map to see estimates).\n\nWhat exactly is the Battleground Tracker, and where do the numbers come from? Here are five things to know.\n\n1. Going state by state to understand this election\n\nWe take a state-by-state approach to describing the race and measuring public opinion, since the presidency is won in the Electoral College, not by the national popular vote. Indeed, relying too much on national polling can be misleading, as 2016 reminded us.\n\nThe Battleground Tracker looks at each individual state, focusing on the most competitive ones. And we translate each candidate's current support to the electoral vote scoreboard. Our state-by-state approach also gives a sense of what voters in different parts of the country think and feel about this year's candidates, national issues and local matters.\n\n2. More than just a poll\n\nWhile surveying voters across the country is an integral part of the Battleground Tracker, this is more than your typical poll. It's really a big data project. We combine polling, voter files from L2 Data (L2 is the firm used by CBS News for voter files), U.S. Census data, and historical trends to get a clear picture of what's going on in each state.\n\nHere's what the data tells us:\n\nWe know which candidates different types of voters are supporting from our polling, which includes much larger sample sizes \u2014 tens of thousands \u2014 than a typical poll;\n\nWe know how many people like them are in each state and county, as well as their turnout history, from voter files and U.S. Census data;\n\nAnd we know each state's previous election results, which enables us to anchor our 2024 estimates to recent history.\n\nOur model combines all this data using multilevel regression with post-stratification (scroll down for more details on this). A feature of this technique is that we use trends across the country to inform our picture of a specific state. If we find Hispanic voters across the Southwest shifting support, for instance, we use the information to more precisely estimate specific states in which Hispanic voters live. The same applies for many other types of voters. The survey lets them tell us what they are thinking, and we map that to how many of them live in each state.\n\nWe collaborate on data collection and modeling with global opinion research firm YouGov, building on our successful efforts in 2018, 2020, and 2022.\n\n3. Think snapshots, not forecasts\n\nWe tell you where races stand today, explaining why and what might change. We fully anticipate movement before the first vote is cast, so we'll update everything regularly in the months ahead.\n\nUnlike an electoral forecast, we're estimating each candidate's current support, incorporating all the data we've collected up to this point. For instance, if we estimate President Biden at 49% in a state with a margin of error of 3 points, we're confident that his support there is between 46% and 52% today \u2014 not that the final result will be in that range.\n\nThere's nothing here to account for forward-looking uncertainty \u2014 nothing about the economy changing or dramatic debates, for example. We fully expect movement before the first vote is cast, so we'll update everything regularly throughout the fall. A race that's leaning toward a party today could be reclassified as a toss-up if it becomes more competitive.\n\n4. Electoral scenarios\n\nThat brings us to scenarios. Down the road, the Battleground Tracker will offer plausible scenarios for how the election might unfold. We'll do this using a combination of statistical simulation and by tweaking some of the assumptions underlying our model, resulting in a range of possible outcomes.\n\nHere's an example. One of the most challenging things to figure out will be turnout: who's actually going to bother to vote? Modeling who is likely to vote is a perennial challenge that is sensitive to assumptions.\n\nIn our baseline model, we estimate which voters are casting ballots based on both what they tell us they're planning to do and historical patterns in their states. In our scenarios, we'll slightly alter the model's parameters to explore what could happen if, for example, large swaths of voters stay home (perhaps for fear of getting sick) or if there's a surge in voting by mail (also possible given intense interest in this election). We'll roll out our scenarios later in the campaign, so check back for them!\n\n5. Models have solid track record\n\nWhile we take a different approach than traditional polling, the Battleground Tracker is based on rigorous methods from the fields of political science, survey research, and statistics. Moreover, we have a strong track record employing similar models at CBS News over the past few years.\n\nOur 2018 model performed particularly well, steadily tracking Democrats' improvement in key races and the eventual blue wave in the U.S. House. In fact, our high-turnout scenario accurately estimated the final seat breakdown, when it came to pass that historic turnout powered Democratic gains.\n\nOur accurate race ratings in 2020 were based on a similar model. We estimated that Democrats had built a lead heading into Election Day, but that Republicans could catch up with a late turnout surge. Every state we classified as leaning Democratic wound up going to Mr. Biden, and each we rated as leaning Republican went to Trump. Of our six toss ups, Trump won four and Mr. Biden won two.\n\nAnd most recently, this methodology enabled us to accurately estimate the 2022 midterm elections. Our model consistently pointed to narrow Republican gains in the House, rather than the red wave that many other analysts expected.\n\nNEW Battleground Tracker estimates out today\n\n\n\nRs still ahead in race for House heading into final week of campaign \u2014 baseline model sees slight shift to GOP\n\n\n\nEight in ten voters say things are \"out of control\" in U.S.\n\n\n\nExplore *range* of possibilities here https://t.co/rAA68pkcsw pic.twitter.com/EG7x52dgn5 \u2014 Kabir K. (@kabir_here) October 30, 2022\n\nMore on the statistical model we use\n\nIf you want to know more about the data and statistical model we use \u2014 and don't mind a bit of jargon \u2014 then keep reading...\n\nFirst, we survey thousands of registered voters across the country and make sure to draw larger samples in battleground states, which we expect to be more competitive. The most important survey questions we ask for estimation purposes are how likely they are to vote and which candidate they would vote for today.\n\nWe then determine how people's vote intentions are related to their characteristics like age, gender, race, education, past vote, where they live, and so on. Each voter has a certain combination, which we'll call a \"profile\" for shorthand. For example, one possible profile is a 45-year-old, Asian female, who holds a college degree, voted for Biden four years ago, and lives in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. Change any one of these characteristics and you get a different profile. We run a multilevel regression \u2014 a way to model the relationship between different variables \u2014 on the survey data to estimate how many voters of each specific profile intend to vote for each major candidate. The regression includes the voter characteristics above, as well as state and district effects (the levels in \"multilevel\").\n\nThe next step is estimating how many people of each voter profile live in each state. For this we use a combination of U.S. census data and voter files, which includes counts of voters at very granular levels, such as voting precincts. In each state, we multiply the total number of voters of a given profile by the proportion of voters with that profile choosing a candidate (the \"post-stratification\" step). Aggregating across all voter profiles in a state, we finally get the estimate of that candidate's statewide vote share. In Maine and Nebraska \u2014 the two states that award electoral votes by congressional district \u2014 we also estimate candidate support in each district.",

        "text": "Warning signs of US recession may be bad news for Kamala Harris\nDonald Trump\u2019s message to US voters has been consistent as he seeks to win a second term in the White House: the economy under Joe Biden has been a disaster.\n\nUntil recently the hard data has not supported Trump\u2019s argument. The US has been comfortably the fastest-growing of the G7 leading industrial nations since the Covid pandemic. Unemployment has been low by historic standards. America\u2019s self-sufficiency in energy meant it suffered a less severe inflation shock than Europe after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nYet the former US president now has some evidence to back up his case. The latest set of US jobs figures, released last week, showed the labour market cooling fast. Payroll growth in July slowed to 114,000 \u2013 about half the average of 215,000 in the previous 12 months and well below economists\u2019 expectations. The unemployment rate rose from 4.1% to 4.3%.\n\nThat set alarm bells ringing. Financial markets have been betting heavily on the US economy being able to shrug off the impact of higher interest rates. The latest GDP figures \u2013 showing annual growth of close to 3% \u2013 supported that view.\n\nBut the cracks in the labour market prompted fears that the economy might now be heading for a hard landing. The 12% drop in Japan\u2019s Nikkei index was in large part driven by concerns that the world\u2019s biggest economy might be cooling fast.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has a rule of thumb measure \u2013 known as the Sahm rule \u2013 for gauging whether the US economy is in recession. Named after the economist Claudia Sahm, this states that when the three-month moving average of the US unemployment rate is 0.5 percentage points or more above its low over the prior 12 months, the economy is in the early months of recession.\n\nLast week\u2019s jobless report from the Bureau of Labour Statistics showed the Sahm rule was on the brink of being triggered. As the consultancy Capital Economics pointed out, the rule will be met next month unless the unemployment rate falls back.\n\nHistorically, the Sahm rule has been a good predictor of looming US recessions, and it has been quoted widely in recent days by those arguing that the Federal Reserve has left it too long to cut interest rates. There has been speculation that, having fallen \u201cbehind the curve\u201d, the Fed may not even wait until its next scheduled meeting next month, and may announce an emergency cut in the coming days.\n\nSome economists warn against putting too much store by the Sahm rule. Dhaval Joshi, an analyst at BCA Research, said: \u201cA decoupling between robust growth in the economy and steadily rising unemployment is unprecedented in our lifetimes. Through the past 60 years, whenever the US unemployment rate has increased by 0.5% in a year, taking it to the cusp of recession, GDP growth has also been on the cusp of recession. That is, until now.\u201d\n\nJoshi said unemployment was rising not because of widespread layoffs but because labour supply had been increasing faster than labour demand. The stock market looked more vulnerable to a recession than the real economy. Tech stocks, in particular those exposed to the artificial intelligence boom, have been among the heaviest fallers.\n\n\u201cRight now, if we should fear a US recession, the question is: a recession in what? As in 2000-01, the biggest risk is a severe recession in the frothy parts of the stock market,\u201d said Joshi.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There are other warning signs for Kamala Harris as she seeks to fend off Trump\u2019s attacks on the current administration\u2019s economic record.\n\nThe performance of the delivery company UPS is often seen as a gauge of how well the US economy is doing. Last month it failed to meet analysts\u2019 estimates and pared back its growth forecasts for the rest of 2024.\n\nWith the presidential election only three months away, the economy is not about to plunge into immediate recession. But signs that households are reining in their spending is bad news for the Democrat presidential hopeful.",

        "text": "US Supreme Court refuses to halt Trump\u2019s hush-money sentencing\nThe decision came in response to a lawsuit by the state of Missouri claiming that the case infringed on voters\u2019 rights.\n\nThe US Supreme Court has declined to halt Donald Trump\u2018s upcoming sentencing for his conviction in state court in New York on felony charges involving hush money paid to a porn star and a related gag order until after the upcoming presidential election.\n\nMonday\u2019s decision by the justices has come in response to a lawsuit by the state of Missouri claiming that the case against Trump infringed on the right of voters under the US Constitution to hear from the Republican presidential nominee as he seeks to regain the White House.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s order was unsigned.\n\nConservative Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito indicated they would have allowed Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, a Republican, to file the suit, though not grant his push to quickly lift the gag order and delay sentencing.\n\nBailey argued that the New York gag order, which Missouri wanted stayed until after the election, wrongly limits what the GOP presidential nominee can say on the campaign trail around the country, and Trump\u2019s eventual sentence could affect his ability to travel.\n\n\u201cThe actions by New York have created constitutional harms that threaten to infringe the rights of Missouri\u2019s voters and electors,\u201d he wrote.\n\nWhile the Supreme Court typically hears appeals, it can act as a trial court in state conflicts.\n\nDemocratic New York Attorney General Letitia James argued that appeals are moving through state courts and there\u2019s no state-on-state conflict that would allow the Supreme Court to weigh in at this point.\n\n\u201cAllowing Missouri to file this suit for such relief against New York would permit an extraordinary and dangerous end-run around former President Trump\u2019s ongoing state court proceedings,\u201d she wrote.\n\nTrump was found guilty in May of falsifying business records to cover up a $130,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels in exchange for her silence before the 2016 US election about a sexual encounter she has said she had with Trump.\n\nProsecutors have said the payment was designed to boost his presidential campaign in 2016, when he defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump, the Republican candidate in this year\u2019s election, denies having had sex with Daniels and has vowed to appeal his conviction after his sentencing, scheduled for September.\n\nHe is also trying to have the conviction overturned, pointing to the July Supreme Court ruling that gave him broad immunity from prosecution as a former president. That finding all but ended the possibility that he could face trial on election interference charges in Washington before the election.\n\nThe high court has rejected other similar suits framed as a conflict between states in recent years, including over the 2020 presidential election results.",

        "text": "Kamala Harris is now Democratic presidential nominee, will face off against Donald Trump this fall\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Vice President Kamala Harris, a daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history, formally secured the Democratic presidential nomination on Monday \u2014 becoming the first woman of color to lead a major party ticket.\n\nMore than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed, Harris\u2019 coronation as her party\u2019s standard-bearer caps a tumultuous and frenetic period for Democrats prompted by President Joe Biden\u2019s disastrous June debate performance that shattered his own supporters\u2019 confidence in his reelection prospects and spurred extraordinary intraparty warfare about whether he should stay in the race.\n\nJust as soon as Biden abruptly ended his candidacy, Harris and her team worked rapidly to secure backing from the 1,976 party delegates needed to clinch the nomination in a formal roll call vote. She reached that marker at warp speed, with an Associated Press survey of delegates nationwide showing she locked down the necessary commitments a mere 32 hours after Biden\u2019s announcement.\n\nHarris\u2019 nomination became official after a five-day round of online balloting by Democratic National Convention delegates ended Monday night, with the party saying in a statement released just before midnight that 99% of delegates casting ballots had done so for Harris. The party had long contemplated the early virtual roll call to ensure Biden would appear on the ballot in every state. It said it would next formally certify the vote before holding a celebratory roll call at the party\u2019s convention later this month in Chicago.\n\nAn Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted after Biden withdrew found 46% of Americans have a favorable view of Harris, while a nearly identical share has an unfavorable view of her. But more Democrats say they are satisfied with her candidacy compared with that of Biden, energizing a party that had long been resigned to the 81-year-old Biden being its nominee against former President Donald Trump, a Republican they view as an existential threat.\n\nAlready Harris has telegraphed that she doesn\u2019t plan to veer much from the themes and policies that framed Biden\u2019s candidacy, such as democracy, gun violence prevention and abortion rights. But her delivery can be far fierier, particularly when she invokes her prosecutorial background to lambast Trump and his 34 felony convictions for falsifying business records in connection with a hush money scheme.\n\n\u201cGiven that unique voice of a new generation, of a prosecutor and a woman when fundamental rights, especially reproductive rights, are on the line, it\u2019s almost as if the stars have aligned for her at this moment in history,\u201d said Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla of California, who was tapped to succeed Harris in the Senate when she became vice president.\n\nA splash in Washington before a collapse in the 2020 primaries\n\nKamala Devi Harris was born Oct. 20, 1964, in Oakland, California, to Shyamala Gopalan, a breast cancer scientist who emigrated to the United States from India when she was 19 years old, and Stanford University emeritus professor Donald Harris, a naturalized U.S. citizen originally from Jamaica. Her parents\u2019 advocacy for civil rights gave her what she described as a \u201cstroller\u2019s-eye view\u201d of the movement.\n\nShe spent years as a prosecutor in the Bay Area before her elevation as the state\u2019s attorney general in 2010 and then election as U.S. senator in 2016.\n\nHarris was sworn in as San Francisco\u2019s district attorney with her mother Dr. Shyamala Gopalan holding a copy of The Bill of Rights in January 2004.

Securing a spot on the coveted Judiciary Committee gave her a national spotlight to interrogate prominent Trump nominees, such as now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not able to be rushed this fast,\u201d then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions said during a 2017 hearing as Harris repeatedly pressed him on potential conversations with Russian nationals. \u201cIt makes me nervous.\u201d\n\nHarris questions Sessions as he testifies before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on June 13, 2017.

But Harris withdrew from the primary race before the first nominating contest in Iowa, plagued by staff dissent that spilled out into the open and an inability to attract enough campaign cash.\n\nHarris struggled to deliver a consistent pitch to Democratic voters and wobbled on key issues such as health care. She suggested she backed eliminating private insurance for a full government-run system \u2014 \u201cMedicare for All\u201d coverage \u2014 before releasing her own health care plan that preserved private insurance. Now, during her nascent general election campaign, Harris has already reversed some of her earlier, more liberal positions, such as a ban on fracking that she endorsed in 2019.\n\nAnd while Harris tried to deploy her law enforcement background as an asset in her 2020 presidential campaign, it never attracted enough support in a party that couldn\u2019t reconcile some of her past tough-on-crime positions at a time of heightened focus on police brutality.\n\nJoining Biden\u2019s team \u2014 and an evolution as vice president\n\nStill, Harris was at the top of the vice presidential shortlist when Biden was pondering his running mate, after his pledge in early 2020 that he would choose a Black woman as his No. 2. He was fond of Harris, who had forged a close friendship with his now-deceased son Beau, who had been Delaware\u2019s attorney general when she was in that job for California.\n\nHer first months as vice president were far from smooth. Biden asked her to lead the administration\u2019s diplomatic efforts with Central America on the root causes of migration to the United States, which triggered attacks from Republicans on border security and remains a political vulnerability. It didn\u2019t help matters that Harris stumbled in big interviews, such as in a 2021 sit-down with NBC News\u2019 Lester Holt when she responded dismissively that \u201cI haven\u2019t been to Europe\u201d when the anchor noted that she hadn\u2019t visited the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nPresident Joe Biden walks with Harris in the Rose Garden of the White House, May 13, 2021, in Washington.

Wade, as she became the chief spokesperson for the administration on abortion rights and was a more natural messenger than Biden, a lifelong Catholic who had in the past favored restrictions on the procedure. She is the first vice president to tour an abortion clinic and speaks about reproductive rights in the broader context of maternal health, especially for Black women.\n\nThroughout her vice presidency, Harris has been careful to remain loyal to Biden while emphasizing that she would be ready to step in if needed. That dramatic transition began in late June after the first debate between Biden and Trump, where the president\u2019s stumbles were so cataclysmic that he could never reverse the loss of confidence from other Democrats.\n\nHeaded to the top of the ticket\n\nAfter Biden ended his candidacy July 21, he quickly endorsed Harris. And during the first two weeks of her 2024 presidential bid, enthusiasm among the Democratic base surged, with donations pouring in, scores of volunteers showing up at field offices and supporters swelling so much in numbers that event organizers have had to swap venues.\n\nThe Harris campaign now believes it has a renewed opportunity to compete in Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina and Georgia \u2014 states that Biden had started to abandon in favor of shoring up the so-called \u201cblue wall\u201d states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cThe country is able to see the Kamala Harris that we all know,\u201d said Bakari Sellers, who was a national co-chair of her 2020 campaign. \u201cWe really didn\u2019t allow the country to see her\u201d four years ago. Sellers said: \u201cWe had her in bubble wrap. What people are seeing now is that she\u2019s real, she\u2019s talented.\u201d\n\nHarris speaks during a campaign rally, July 30, 2024, in Atlanta.

Harris has also yet to answer extended questions from journalists nor sit down for a formal interview since she began her run.\n\nThe Trump campaign has been eager to define Harris as she continues to introduce herself to voters nationwide, releasing an ad blaming her for the high number of illegal crossings at the southern border during the Biden administration and dubbing her \u201cFailed. Weak. Dangerously liberal.\u201d\n\nThe Republican nominee\u2019s supporters have also derisively branded Harris as a diversity hire, while Trump himself has engaged in ugly racial attacks of his own, wrongly asserting that Harris had in the past only promoted her Indian heritage and only recently played up her Black identity.\n\nHis remarks are previewing a season of racist and sexist claims against the person who would be the first woman and the first person of South Asian heritage in the presidency.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black and now she wants to be known as Black,\u201d Trump said while addressing the annual convention of the National Association of Black Journalists. \u201cSo, I don\u2019t know, is she Indian or is she Black?\u201d\n\nIn her response, Harris called it \u201cthe same old show \u2014 the divisiveness and the disrespect\u201d and said voters \u201cdeserve better.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe American people deserve a leader who tells the truth, a leader who does not respond with hostility and anger when confronted with the facts,\u201d Harris said at a Sigma Gamma Rho sorority gathering in Houston. \u201cWe deserve a leader who understands that our differences do not divide us.\u201d",

        "text": "Harris has momentum, but the race is still tight. Here are the paths to the presidency\nHarris has momentum, but the race is still tight. Here are the paths to the presidency\n\nFor more on the 2024 race head to the NPR Network's live updates page.\n\nLoading...\n\nSince President Biden dropped out of the presidential race and the Democratic Party has coalesced around Vice President Harris, the political world has changed.\n\nAfter Biden\u2019s dismal debate performance in late June, swing-state polls showed a small, but significant decline for Biden, enough that Biden bowed out of the race. Since Harris\u2019 entry, though, she has seen a surge across the most competitive states with far more Democratic enthusiasm, but it\u2019s still a very close election, an NPR analysis finds, that could go either way.\n\nRepublican former President Donald Trump currently holds a 268-226 lead over Harris in the latest NPR Electoral Map of the most competitive states (see map above), just short of the 270 needed to win the presidency. Trump had led in the \"Blue Wall\" states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan before Biden exited, but now the states are pure toss-ups.\n\nTrump's leads in the \"Sun Belt\" states of North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada have been sliced in half since Harris got in because of the increased Democratic enthusiasm and her appeal to younger and nonwhite voters. Still, Trump retains small but consistent leads. That could change if Harris continues her momentum, but at this point, they are ever so slightly in the \"lean Republican\" category.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThis analysis is based on more than just polling. It's also informed by reporting from the field, conversations with campaigns and also considers the history of how states have voted in the past. We also include a map strictly based on polling (below). That shows a slightly closer 268-241 Trump lead.\n\nFor the state polling, NPR's analysis is based on surveys aggregated by FiveThirtyEight and DDHQ/The Hill. If a candidate had an average lead in both aggregators of 1 point or more, as of Friday afternoon, it is colored a shade of red for Trump or blue for Harris. If it was less than that, it\u2019s yellow for \"Toss Up.\"\n\n\n\nMap based strictly on polling\n\nThis will change between now and Nov. 5, and the NPR maps will be updated periodically to reflect those changes. But for now this analysis is intended to give a rough overview of where the race currently stands since Harris has gotten in \u2014 and not necessarily where it will be in the end.\n\nLoading...\n\nPaths to the White House\n\nEven though Harris is down in the NPR Election Map, she has more potential paths to 270 than Trump does. Here's a look at how both could get there:\n\n\n\nHarris\n\n1. The Blue Wall: If Harris wins all three Blue Wall states, as well as the one congressional district in the Omaha, Neb., area that Biden won handily in 2020, she would be at 270 without any of the Sun Belt states (provided she wins all of the states that are leaning her direction and is currently leading). It's her easiest path to the White House, and because of that, these Blue Wall states are a key focus of the Harris campaign. It's also why there has been such a focus on Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro as a potential Harris running mate.\n\n2. The Sun Belt options: If Harris is able to win one or multiple Sun Belt states, she could make up for deficiencies in the Blue Wall. Her campaign is optimistic that she could turn the tide in the Sun Belt and points out that it has seen an uptick in not just donations, but volunteers in these states.\n\nTrump\n\n1. Pennsylvania and Georgia are must-wins: It's become clear that the Trump campaign views these two states as places it has to win. Just look at its ad spending. Since Super Tuesday, Trump and his allies have spent 77% of all their ad money in these two states \u2014 $50 million in Pennsylvania and $16 million in Georgia, according to data from AdImpact analyzed by NPR.\n\nWhy are they so important? Trump would get to exactly 270 with these two states and the other states currently leaning in his favor \u2014 without having to win North Carolina, Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin or Michigan.",

        "text": "Chairman Steil Launches Expanded Investigation into Online Political Donations Through ActBlue\nWASHINGTON - Today, Committee on House Administration Chairman Bryan Steil (WI-01) announced its next phase of oversight into ActBlue's online political donation operation amid concerns that ActBlue is violating or skirting federal campaign finance (FCF) laws. In launching the investigation, Chairman Steil released the following statement:\n\n\n\n\"Illegal and malicious conduct have no place in our elections. Ensuring all parties are complying with federal election law as we approach a presidential election is of utmost importance. By launching a new phase of our investigation into ActBlue, the Committee on House Administration has begun robust oversight of ActBlue's lenient donor verification standards. I'm committed to ensuring Americans can have confidence in our elections and to preventing foreign or malicious actors from influencing American elections.\"\n\n\n\nIn launching the next phase of the investigation, Chairman Steil sent a letter to Federal Election Commission (FEC) Chairman Cooksey and Vice Chair Weintraub requesting the FEC immediately initiate an emergency rulemaking process to require political campaigns verify the card verification value (CVV) of donors who contribute online and a rulemaking to prohibit political committees from accepting online contributions from gift cards or credit and debit cards. In addition to the letter, the Committee has scheduled a briefing with the FEC investigations team set for later this month.\n\n\n\nRead the full text of the letter here.\n\n\n\nIn addition, Chairman Steil's plan includes legislation to:\n\nRequire political committees to verify the CVV and address information of donors that contribute via a credit or debit card,\n\nProhibit political committees from accepting donations from a gift card or other prepaid credit card\n\nRequire political campaigns to get the affirmative consent of donors before they make a reoccuring contribution\n\nBackground:\n\n\n\nIn recent weeks, a wide array of sources have voiced concerns that ActBlue is violating or skirting federal campaign finance laws in several ways including:\n\nLaundering foreign contributions through prepaid gift cards and U.S. credit and debit cardholders.\n\nUsing prepaid giftcards and credit cards as a vehicle without knowledge of the owner to launder campaign contributions that would violate Federal Campaign Finance (FCF) law.\n\nDeliberate nonuse of the CVV number to hinder verification of the owner or location of the credit card holder.\n\nReceipt of a significant number of donations from individuals who are retired and live on a fixed income.\n\nSudden appearance of very large donations from individuals who have previously donated much smaller amounts.\n\nPatterns of hundreds of donations for $2.50 from the same individual.\n\nState Attorney's General from Virginia, Wyoming, and Missouri are conducting similar investigations into ActBlue.\n\nOn September 20, 2023, Chairman Steil held the first full committee hearing with the Federal Election Commission in over a decade.\n\n\n\nOn October 31, 2023 Chairman Steil sent a letter demanding answers on ActBlue's practices, questioning if they are complying with federal campaign finance laws and preventing foreign and illegal contributions.\n\n###",

        "text": "Democracy Up Close: Augsburg\u2019s Connection to the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election - News and Media\nDemocratic engagement is a deeply held value at Augsburg University. This year, an unusual connection to the 2024 U.S. presidential contest promises an extraordinary level of interest and opportunity for Augsburg students around the upcoming election.\n\nSince 2019, Minnesota\u2019s First Lady, Gwen Walz, has held appointments as an instructor of education at Augsburg and as a special assistant for strategic partnerships in the Office of the President. At Augsburg, she has helped develop and co-teach a master\u2019s-level education course called \u201cConnecting Policy, Practice, and Advocacy for Educational Equity.\u201d She has worked to build connections between campus programs and state agencies to offer internships and experiential learning opportunities. And she has worked closely with the Provost\u2019s Office to encourage voter participation and democratic engagement.\n\nNow, students who were used to seeing Walz on campus will see her in a different context. On Tuesday, Vice President President Kamala Harris announced Governor Tim Walz as her running mate in the November presidential election.\n\n\u201cGovernor Walz\u2019s selection as the Democratic vice-presidential nominee represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for education and engagement around this election cycle,\u201d said Augsburg President Paul C. Pribbenow. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful reminder for our students that whether on a college campus or in our nation\u2019s capital, the hard work of democracy, at its core, is the same: finding ways to come together across difference to work for the common good.\u201d\n\nRead more about Gwen Walz in the March 2023 issue of Augsburg Now.\n\nAbout Augsburg University\n\nAugsburg University offers more than 50 undergraduate majors and 11 graduate degrees to more than 3,100 students of diverse backgrounds at its campus in the vibrant center of the Twin Cities. In 2023, U.S. News & World Report identified Augsburg as the most ethnically diverse regional university in the Midwest. Augsburg educates students to be informed citizens, thoughtful stewards, critical thinkers, and responsible leaders. An Augsburg education is defined by excellence in the liberal arts and professional studies, guided by the faith and values of the Lutheran church, and shaped by its urban and global settings.

        "text": "Poll: Harris jumps to a small national lead over Trump\nPoll: Harris jumps to a small national lead over Trump\n\ntoggle caption Andrew Harnik/Getty Images; Bill Pugliano/Getty Images\n\nVice President Harris has upended the presidential race and has now built a 51%-48% lead over former President Trump, according to the latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll.\n\nThat result is 4 points better than just after Harris got into the race two weeks ago when President Biden bowed out. Harris maintains a 3-point lead (48%-45%) when third-party choices are offered, too.\n\nLoading...\n\nFueling her rise are Black voters, white women with college degrees and women who identify as political independents. She is doing 20 to 30 points better with them than when she first got in, leading to improvement in the suburbs and with white voters overall.\n\nOn the issues, the negative views of the economy are not sticking to Harris the way they did Biden. Trump is still more trusted on the economy, but only by 3 points over Harris (51%-48%), compared to 9 points over Biden (54%-45%) in June.\n\nHarris is also seeing improvement on how she would handle immigration, though Trump is still more trusted on that topic by 6 points (52%-46%). Harris\u2019 best issue is handling abortion rights. She has a 15-point advantage on that.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe survey was conducted from Thursday through Sunday, before Harris picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her vice-presidential running mate. Marist interviewed 1,613 adults via cellphone, landline and online research panels in English and in Spanish. The survey has a margin of error of +/- 3.3 percentage points, meaning results could be roughly 3 points higher or lower.\n\nWomen, Black voters and independents have all moved toward Harris\n\nBecause of Harris\u2019 gains with certain groups, she\u2019s also improved her standing in the suburbs and with white voters overall.\n\nBut there\u2019s now a 22-point gender gap, which is wider than the margin between Trump and Biden in July. Harris now leads by 13 points with women (55%-42%), but is losing men by 9 points (54%-45%). Considering the margin of error, those are close to the results of the 2020 presidential election, according to exit polls.\n\nHarris\u2019 biggest boost is coming with Black voters. She has gone from a 23-point lead with Black voters over Trump a couple of weeks ago, when many voters moved into the undecided camp, to a 54-point lead now. Harris is moving closer to territory where Democrats need to be with Black voters.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSome Black voters, who appeared to be considering Trump, have moved away from him, as he\u2019s dropped 10 points with them.\n\nHarris is also now winning independents, something Biden was not doing. Harris is up 9 points with independents (53%-44%). She was down 14 points with them last month. And in early July, Trump was beating Biden by 4 points with the group.\n\nHarris has also improved with white voters overall. Harris has gone from 40% with white voters overall to 46% in this survey, which is closer to where Biden was, and that\u2019s very high for a Democrat. In fact, no Democrat has scored that high with white voters in a presidential election since Jimmy Carter in 1976. Biden got 41% in 2020, Barack Obama in 2008 won 43%.\n\nThat improvement is mostly because of college-educated white women. White voters without degrees, a core Trump base group, are heavily in Trump\u2019s favor and their margin is unchanged. Two-thirds of college-educated white women, though, are now in Harris\u2019 camp, which would be far higher than the percentage that sided with Biden in 2020.\n\nShe\u2019s also winning with older voters. Harris is leading Trump by 11 points with baby boomers (55%-44%), for example.\n\nLatinos have also moved in Harris\u2019 favor. Fifty-eight percent say they would vote for her now, compared to 51% last month. That\u2019s still below the 65% Biden won in 2020.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHarris is not where she needs to be with voters under 45 at this point. Biden won them in 2020 by 14 points. Harris and Trump right now are tied with the group. Where Harris does far better than Biden with the group, though, is retaining them when third parties are introduced.\n\nBiden was seeing double-digit drop-offs with Gen Z/millennials, for example. Harris, on the other hand, maintains and slightly expands her margin when respondents have a choice of candidates other than the two major-party picks.\n\n\n\nHarris is benefiting from a boost in enthusiasm with core Democratic voter groups\n\nBlack, Latino and younger voters are saying they\u2019re more fired up to vote now that Harris is in the race.\n\nBlack voters, Latinos and Gen Z/millennial voters have all jumped double-digits in saying they\u2019re definitely voting.\n\nIn July, just 71% of Black voters, 68% of Latinos and 65% of Gen Z/millennials said they were definitely voting, among the lowest of any groups.\n\nBut now, that\u2019s up to 81% with Black voters, 84% with Latinos and 80% with Gen Z/millennials, closer to being on par with white voters than in previous surveys.\n\n\n\nThird parties seeing their lowest marks of the election\n\nWith Harris in the race, people appear to be moving away from third parties.\n\nAll of the third-party candidates are seeing their worst scores since Marist started asking about them in April. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., running as an independent, is down to just 5%. Professor Cornel West, also running as an independent, Green Party candidate Jill Stein and Libertarian Chase Oliver are all polling at or below 1%.\n\nKennedy still does best with those who have an unfavorable opinion of both Trump and Harris, pulling in about a third of those voters.\n\n\n\nPeople are split on who they think will win, but far more say Harris will than they said of Biden\n\nLast month, respondents were 20 points more likely to say Trump would beat Biden (59%-39%). Now, they\u2019re split (48%-48%).\n\nSponsor Message\n\nNotably, independents have flipped from 58% thinking Trump would win to 52% now saying they think Harris will.\n\nPeople are also more satisfied with their choices, though only 47% say they are compared to 50% who say they are not. In June, there was a 10-point difference between people satisfied (42%) and those who were dissatisfied with their choices (52%).\n\n\n\nBeing honest and trustworthy is the most important quality for a president\n\nWhile trustworthiness was the most important quality for Democrats and independent voters, a plurality of Republicans said a \u201cstrong leader\u201d was most important to them.\n\n\n\nAll signs continue to point to a close election \u2014 not just in the presidential but also for Congress\n\nForty-seven percent said they want to see Democrats in control of Congress, while 45% said Republicans. That 2-point advantage is unchanged from June.\n\nDemocrats traditionally need a wider advantage in that score to make significant gains \u2014 in 2022, when they denied Republicans from winning a wave of House seats, they had a 4-point edge in the Marist poll; in 2020, it was 8, but Democrats lost House seats; they were +6 in 2018 and made significant gains, however; in 2014, when Republicans won seats, Republicans were +5 on the question.\n\nThe congressional ballot and the change in numbers of seats don\u2019t always correlate cleanly because of where the most competitive seats are that cycle. In this cycle, for example, many are in suburban areas in New York, California and around Philadelphia, where Democrats have advantages in presidential years because of higher turnout among their core voter groups.\n\n\n\nBiden\u2019s approval is up\n\nNow that Biden has dropped out of the race, his approval rating is seeing a bounce.\n\nHis approval is now 46%, which is the highest since February of 2023 and up 5 points since last month.",

        "text": "Kamala Harris poised to announce vice-presidential choice\nKamala Harris poised to announce her running mate\n\nGetty Images Kamala Harris will hold campaign events in seven cities this week, beginning with a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday\n\nVice-President Kamala Harris is expected to announce her running mate by Tuesday morning, ending two weeks of intense speculation as the US hurtles towards November's presidential election. Ms Harris interviewed several top contenders in Washington DC over the weekend, including Josh Shapiro, Tim Walz and Mark Kelly. Her choice will join her on a whirlwind five-day tour of seven cities this week as Ms Harris ramps up her campaign in key battleground states. The most recent poll from CBS, the BBC's US partner, shows Ms Harris and Trump in a tight race nationally, with the Democrat holding a one-point lead over her Republican challenger.\n\nThe poll released on Sunday shows Trump and Ms Harris tied in battleground states, where the former president held a five-point lead while Joe Biden remained in the race. Following the announcement expected on Tuesday morning, a campaign video will be released before Ms Harris and her new running mate jointly hold a rally in Philadelphia that evening. She reportedly met her vetting team - led by former US attorney general Eric Holder - over the weekend and received in-depth presentations on their findings, including potential political vulnerabilities. She met three of those candidates - Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro - on Sunday. She also met another top contender - Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg - on Friday and is understood to have spoken with other candidates virtually, US media report. On Monday afternoon, in response to a report that Ms Harris had made her pick, a campaign spokesperson, Kevin Munoz, wrote on social media that she was still deciding. \"We understand the excitement and interest here, but VP Harris has made no decision on a running mate yet!\" he said. It comes as the DNC finished a virtual roll call vote that saw Ms Harris officially become the first black and South Asian American nominee for a major US party's White House campaign. The Harris campaign has met with a flurry of lobbying efforts on behalf of - or criticising - the candidates. Mr Shapiro, for example, has drawn sharp opposition from some left-wing groups for his support of private school vouchers in Pennsylvania - a Republican-backed proposal to send $100m to families for private school tuition and school supplies - as well as his pro-Israel views.\n\nThe Philadelphia event will be followed by a string of campaign events across Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia and Arizona, before ending with a campaign event in Las Vegas, Nevada, on 10 August. Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, have both suggested that Ms Harris' choice of running mate will ultimately have no impact on the upcoming election. In an episode of the \"Full Send\" podcast aired on Friday, Mr Vance said he believed the vice-presidential choice \"doesn't really matter, as much as this hits my ego\". \"People are going to vote primarily for Donald Trump or for Kamala Harris,\" he said. \"That's the way these things go.\" Similarly, Trump has largely shrugged off questions about Ms Harris's choice, arguing last week that the vice-presidential role \"does not have any impact\". On Sunday, however, Trump criticised Mr Shapiro on Fox News, saying that Ms Harris could lose \"her little Palestinian base\" if she chooses him. Mr Shapiro, who during his student days wrote in a college magazine that Palestinians were \"too battle minded\", told reporters on Friday that he now supported a two-state solution.",

        "text": "Polls show Kamala Harris moving ahead of Donald Trump in 2024 US election\nAs Kamala Harris named Tim Walz, the Minnesota governor, as her running mate, recent polls showed the vice-president moving ahead of Donald Trump in the race for the White House.\n\nAmong recent national head-to-head polls, SurveyUSA put Harris up three points ahead of Trump, 48%-45%; Morning Consult put her up four points, 48%-44%; YouGov and CBS News made it a one-point Harris lead, 50%-49%; and University of Massachusetts Amherst put Harris up three, 46%-43%.\n\nThose results were mostly within the margin of error.\n\nBut Tatishe Nteta, provost professor of political science at UMass Amherst and director of its poll, pointed to a key finding: a seven-point swing to the Democrat since January, when Trump led Joe Biden by four.\n\n\u201cFor weeks after the first presidential debate in June,\u201d Nteta said, \u201cDemocratic donors, prominent Democratic elected officials and members of the news media made the case that President Joe Biden faced long odds to defeat former President Donald Trump and called for Biden to step down.\n\n\u201cIn the aftermath of Biden\u2019s historic decision to forgo his re-election campaign, it seems as if Biden\u2019s critics were indeed correct as his replacement, Vice-President Kamala Harris, has emerged as the frontrunner in the race for the White House.\n\n\u201cWhile there are still three months to go, the Harris campaign and the Democratic party must like their chances to maintain control of the White House and to send former President Trump to his second consecutive defeat in his quest to return to Pennsylvania Avenue.\u201d\n\nThere was also good news for Harris from the Hill, as the site\u2019s \u201cultimate hub for polls, predictions and election results\u201d showed the Democrat with a positive favourability rating for the first time, after a steep climb since mid-July, when Biden stepped down.\n\nAs to be expected, August polls in the seven battleground states where the election is expected to be decided presented a more mixed picture.\n\nIn polls concluding in August, Public Policy Polling, a Democratic firm, found Harris up one in Georgia but down two on Trump in Arizona and down one in Pennsylvania. Trafalgar/Insider Advantage, a right-leaning operation, put Trump up two in Georgia.\n\nAccording to battleground averages maintained by the polling site FiveThirtyEight, Trump led Harris by two points in Arizona and one in Georgia, with Harris up by two points Michigan, one in Pennsylvania and one and a half in Wisconsin.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With Harris in place, Siena College found her up 14 points, 53%-39%.\n\nOn Monday, Nate Silver, founder of FiveThirtyEight and an influential voice among polling analysts, said Harris \u201cnow has a real lead in national polls \u2013 about two points \u2013 and has also been ahead in most recent polls of\u201d Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nConcerns about economic conditions should not be counted out, Silver said, on a day of Wall Street sell-offs and reports of recession fears. \u201cBut the momentum in the polls outweighs it for now.\u201d",

        "text": "August 5, 2024, presidential campaign news\nThe Republicans for Harris coalition kicked off its North Carolina campaign Monday with a virtual news conference featuring four elected Republicans and former Republicans explaining their support for the Democratic ticket this election.\n\nFormer Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, former North Carolina Supreme Court Justice Bob Orr, former Mecklenburg County GOP board member Michael Tucker and US Army veteran Scott Peoples addressed their personal reasons for endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, and what role the newly formed coalition of Republicans and former Republicans will have in the plan to turn the battleground state blue in November.\n\n\u201cUnprecedented times call for unprecedented measures. I\u2019m a Republican, but more importantly, I\u2019m an American. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m here,\u201d said Duncan to start the press conference.\n\n\u201cI am proudly endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris to be the next president of the United States, for a number of reasons. And not many of those are because of all the policies, but because of the person. Because of the adherence to the Constitution and because it\u2019s going to be a stable hand in a time when this country needs a stable hand to get us to the next step,\u201d he added.\n\nOrr, a Republican for 45 years before switching his registration to unaffiliated \u201cafter January 6 and the events that followed,\u201d told the press on the call that \u201cthe stakes are simply too high not to take action.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump failed Republicans. He failed Americans. And he failed our country when he was serving as president. A second Trump term would be an even great danger to our democracy and Constitution than the first,\u201d said Orr, adding that he recently attended a Harris campaign event in Greensboro. \u201cIt could not be more important to ensure that never again in the position to use the office of the presidency for his own personal gain.\u201d\n\nThe Harris campaign has said the coalition will \u201cplay a pivotal role in engaging Trump-skeptical Republican voters across North Carolina, facilitating Republican-to-Republican voter contact, including by hosting Republican-featured events, door knocking, phone banking, spearheading letter-to-the-editor campaigns, and building local networks with Republican organizations, businesses, and community groups.\u201d\n\nTucker said he cast one of the more than 250,000 votes for Nikki Haley in the North Carolina\u2019s Republican primary back in March, and now, he is \u201cactively working to protect America to identify other Republicans who have also been alienated by Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nTucker, Peoples and Orr all acknowledged that many Republicans or Republican-leaning voters in North Carolina likely do not feel comfortable with casting a ballot for a Democrat- or at least, admitting that are doing that.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not alone if you feel this way and you are hearing this, there are other Republicans who feel the same way you do,\u201d said Tucker.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have to step forward like we are. All they have to do is go in that voting booth, in the privacy of that spot, and do the right thing for America. And that is vote for Vice President Harris,\u201d said Orr.",

        "text": "U.S. presidential election: New poll shows Kamala Harris strengthening against Donald Trump\nA new poll confirmed Sunday, August 4, 2024, that Kamala Harris -- set to name her vice presidential pick imminently -- has drawn level with Donald Trump, transforming a White House race that the Republican had been increasingly confident he was going to win.\n\nAs the November 5 election rapidly approaches, Harris has erased the growing lead that Trump was building before President Joe Biden dropped his reelection bid.\n\nAccording to the CBS News/YouGov poll released Sunday, Harris has a one percent advantage on Trump nationwide -- compared to Trump's previous five point edge on Biden.\n\nIn the swing states that decide the Electoral College contest in US elections, Harris and Trump -- who shocked the world with his 2016 presidential victory but was beaten by Biden in 2020 -- are equal.\n\nThese are considered good numbers for a Democratic candidate who parachuted into the race only last month, when Biden bowed to mounting concerns over his mental acuity and ability at 81 years old to serve a second term.\n\nBut Harris, who is Biden's vice president and the first Black and South Asian woman ever in the role, is in a sprint to define herself to voters before Trump does.\n\nA big moment in that process will be when Harris announces her choice for running mate in a historic bid to become America's first female president. This could happen as early as Sunday or Monday.\n\nExpectations are that Harris will pick a white man to balance the ticket -- and likely a moderate Democrat who would help counterweigh attacks on Harris from Republicans that she is too far to the left.\n\nVP shortlist\n\nThe three figures seen as heading the short list -- Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona -- were all visiting Harris in Washington on Sunday, The Washington Post reported.\n\n\"It's her first major decision that she's making as an executive, so it tells you about her thought process,\" Amy Walter, a polling expert from Cook Political Report newsletter, told CBS News.\n\nThe CBS poll, which echoes numerous other surveys indicating rapid gains by Harris, shows that Trump is still favored by voters on the key issue of the economy.\n\nOnly 25 percent said they expected to be better off financially if Harris wins, compared to 45 percent who said so about Trump.\n\nHowever, when it comes to trust in the candidates' temperament, the poll shows voters prefer the former California prosecutor to Trump, a convicted felon who has made a career out of publicly insulting those who oppose him -- including while president.\n\nThe issue of cognitive health, which used to bedevil Biden, is now a liability for 78-year-old Trump, the poll found. Only 51 percent of respondents thought Trump is mentally capable for the presidency, compared to 64 percent for Harris.\n\nThe Democrats believe that if you \"make this referendum on Trump rather than a referendum on the current state of the economy, then we have a real opportunity to win,\" Cook said.\n\nTrump was riding high politically last month after surviving an assassination attempt at a rally, then using the Republican convention to highlight his image of vigor against the physically frail Biden.\n\nBut with Biden's dramatic exit and Harris's fast start, he's scrambling to recalibrate.\n\nAt a rally on Saturday in the swing state of Georgia, Trump called Harris a \"Marxist\" and a \"radical left freak,\" claiming she would cause an \"economic crash.\" On Wednesday, he shocked many when he told an audience of Black journalists that Harris had \"turned Black\" out of political expediency.\n\nWhere Biden often attacked Trump as a threat to democracy, given his unprecedented refusal to accept his loss in 2020, Harris's team has honed a sharper -- more meme-friendly -- line built around branding Trump and his vice presidential pick J.D. Vance \"weird.\"\n\nOn Saturday, the Harris campaign said Trump was \"scared\" to debate her after he turned down a previously scheduled televised debate on ABC, while saying he'd be ready to debate her on Fox News -- a network that has for years given him support.",

        "text": "Poll: Harris boosts confidence that Democrats could win the 2024 election\nMoving Vice President Kamala Harris to the top of the ticket has reinvigorated Democrats\u2019 prospects of winning the White House, according to a new PBS News/NPR/Marist poll.\n\nWeeks ago, many Democrats were losing confidence that their party\u2019s presumptive nominee, President Joe Biden, would be able to defeat former President Donald Trump. Before Biden left the race, 39 percent of Americans \u2013 regardless of who they support \u2013 said he stood a chance at winning the election.\n\nREAD MORE: Here\u2019s how Americans feel about Tim Walz\n\nIn this latest poll, 48 percent of U.S. adults said they think Harris will win, putting her in a dead-heat with Trump. Another 48 percent of Americans said they think he has the best shot of getting elected.\n\n\u201cDemocrats are totally of a different mindset,\u201d said Lee Miringoff, who directs the Marist Institute for Public Opinion. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the Harris candidacy has unleashed a whole new wave of enthusiasm among Democrats, and in the process has also moved some voters who were either straddling the fence or were in Trump\u2019s column.\u201d\n\nConfidence in Trump\u2019s ability to recapture the presidency has been shaken since a month ago, when 59 percent of voters overall thought he\u2019d win.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a complete flip of a switch,\u201d Republican strategist Olivia Troye said.\n\nCompared to June, more people also report being satisfied with the candidates for the president. In this latest poll, 47 percent of Americans said they were satisfied with who Democrats and Republicans have put forward, marking a 5 percentage-point increase since earlier in the summer. Still, 50 percent of Americans overall say they are dissatisfied with their options.\n\nFor much of his presidential race, Biden struggled to gain momentum among younger voters and voters of color. These latest poll numbers show where Harris has already gained ground and how much further she needs to go to motivate communities to throw their support behind her, Miringoff said.\n\nHarris vs. Trump\n\nIf the election were today, 51 percent of U.S. registered voters said they would support Harris and 48 percent said they would back Trump, a gap that narrowly falls within the margin of error.\n\nHere are more takeaways:\n\nSupport for Harris rose 6 percentage points since Biden announced he would exit the race.\n\nsince Biden announced he would exit the race. Trump saw a 2 percentage-point jump in support since late July.\n\nin support since late July. Democrats, Black voters and white women who graduated from college were most likely to support Harris .\n\n. Republicans, white men who did not graduate from college and white Christian evangelicals were most likely to support Trump.\n\nWhen registered voters were asked to consider a race including third-party candidates like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Harris\u2019 lead over Trump was diminished, falling just within the margin of error.\n\nWith a wider roster to choose from, 48 percent said they would vote for Harris if the election were today.\n\nsaid they would vote for Harris if the election were today. 45 percent said they would back Trump.\n\nsaid they would back Trump. 5 percent of registered voters said they would vote for Kennedy.\n\nSurvey interviews with voters concluded before a news story broke that Kennedy had been involved in leaving a dead black bear cub in New York City\u2019s Central Park.\n\nOn the issues\n\nThe most important quality in a possible president is someone American can trust, according to this latest poll. Overall, 27 percent picked honesty and trustworthiness as an essential characteristic, while 20 percent said they want a strong leader.\n\nIn this poll, Americans also were asked which of the two major party candidates they thought would better manage a series of pressing issues.\n\nOn the economy , 51 percent of Americans said Trump would do a better job of leading, while 48 percent said Harris would be do better.\n\n, 51 percent of Americans said Trump would do a better job of leading, while 48 percent said Harris would be do better. On abortion , 56 percent of Americans said Harris would do a better job managing the issue, while 41 percent said Trump would.\n\n, 56 percent of Americans said Harris would do a better job managing the issue, while 41 percent said Trump would. On immigration, 52 percent of Americans said Trump would handle the issue best, while46 percent said Harris would.\n\nLess than two weeks out from the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents were split over whether Harris should continue to pursue Biden administration policies or plan to forge a new path for the U.S.\n\nForty-eight percent of likely Democratic voters said they want Harris to further build upon the work Biden started, while 49 percent said they want Harris to take the country in a new direction. At the moment, Democrats feel largely united behind their future nominee, but as Miringoff warned, it\u2019s too soon to \u201cstart measuring the windows for curtains in the White House.\u201d\n\nPBS News, NPR and Marist Poll conducted a survey on Aug. 1 through 4 that polled 1,613 U.S. adults with a margin of error of 3.3 percentage points, 1,513 registered voters with a margin of error of 3.4 percentage points, 1,309 registered voters who definitely plan to vote in November\u2019s general election with a margin of error of 3.7 percentage points and 717 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents with a margin of error of 4.9 percentage points.",

        "text": "Five things to know about Tim Walz\n\u25b6 Follow AP\u2019s live coverage of the 2024 election\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Vice President Kamala Harris has decided on Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate in her bid for the White House. The 60-year-old Democrat and military veteran rose to the forefront with a series of plain-spoken television appearances in the days after President Joe Biden decided not to seek a second term. He has made his state a bastion of liberal policy and, this year, one of the few states to protect fans buying tickets online for Taylor Swift concerts and other live events.\n\nSome things to know about Walz:\n\nWalz comes from rural America\n\nIt would be hard to find a more vivid representative of the American heartland than Walz. Born in West Point, Nebraska, a community of about 3,500 people northwest of Omaha, Walz joined the Army National Guard and became a teacher in Nebraska.\n\nHe and his wife moved to Mankato in southern Minnesota in the 1990s. That\u2019s where he taught social studies and coached football at Mankato West High School, including for the 1999 team that won the first of the school\u2019s four state championships. He still points to his union membership there.\n\nWalz served 24 years in the Army National Guard, rising to command sergeant major, one of the highest enlisted ranks in the military, although he didn\u2019t complete all the training before he retired so his rank for benefits purposes was set at master sergeant.\n\nHe has a proven ability to connect with conservative voters\n\nIn his first race for Congress, Walz upset a Republican incumbent. That was in 2006, when he won in a largely rural, southern Minnesota congressional district against six-term Rep. Gil Gutknecht. Walz capitalized on voter anger with then-President George W. Bush and the Iraq war.\n\nDuring six terms in the U.S. House, Walz championed veterans\u2019 issues.\n\nHe\u2019s also shown a down-to-earth side, partly through social media video posts with his daughter, Hope. One last fall showed them trying a Minnesota State Fair ride, \u201cThe Slingshot,\u201d after they bantered about fair food and her being a vegetarian.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz speaks during a news conference for the Biden-Harris campaign discussing the Project 2025 plan during the third day of the 2024 Republican National Convention near the Fiserv Forum, Wednesday, July 17, 2024, in Milwaukee.

(AP Photo/Joe Lamberti) Share Share Copy Link copied\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nX\n\nReddit\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nFlipboard\n\nPrint Read More\n\nHe could help the ticket in key Midwestern states\n\nWhile Walz isn\u2019t from one of the crucial \u201cblue wall\u201d states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, where both sides believe they need to win, he\u2019s right next door. He also could ensure that Minnesota stays in the hands of Democrats.\n\nThat\u2019s important because former President Donald Trump has portrayed Minnesota as being in play this year, even though the state hasn\u2019t elected a Republican to statewide office since 2006. A GOP presidential candidate hasn\u2019t carried the state since President Richard Nixon\u2019s landslide in 1972, but Trump has already campaigned there.\n\nWhen Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton decided not to seek a third term in 2018, Walz campaigned and won the office on a \u201cOne Minnesota\u201d theme.\n\nWalz also speaks comfortably about issues that matter to voters in the Rust Belt. He\u2019s been a champion of Democratic causes, including union organizing, workers\u2019 rights and a $15-an-hour minimum wage.\n\nHe has experience with divided government\n\nIn his first term as governor, Walz faced a Legislature split between a Democratic-led House and a Republican-controlled Senate that resisted his proposals to use higher taxes to boost money for schools, health care and roads. But he and lawmakers brokered compromises that made the state\u2019s divided government still seem productive.\n\nBipartisan cooperation became tougher during his second year as he used the governor\u2019s emergency power during the COVID-19 pandemic to shutter businesses and close schools. Republicans pushed back and forced out some agency heads. Republicans also remain critical of Walz over what they see as his slow response to sometimes violent unrest that followed the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020.\n\nThings got easier for Walz in his second term, after he defeated Republican Scott Jensen, a physician known nationally as a vaccine skeptic. Democrats gained control of both legislative chambers, clearing the way for a more liberal course in state government, aided by a huge budget surplus.\n\nWalz and lawmakers eliminated nearly all of the state abortion restrictions enacted in the past by Republicans, protected gender-affirming care for transgender youth and legalized the recreational use of marijuana.\n\nRejecting Republican pleas that the state budget surplus be used to cut taxes, Democrats funded free school meals for children, free tuition at public colleges for students in families earning under $80,000 a year, a paid family and medical leave program and health insurance coverage regardless of a person\u2019s immigration status.\n\nFILE - Minnesota Gov.

Walz later reiterated the characterization on CNN, citing Trump\u2019s repeated mentions of the fictional serial killer Hannibal Lecter from the film \u201cSilence of the Lambs\u201d in stump speeches.\n\nThe word quickly morphed into a theme for Harris and other Democrats and has a chance to be a watchword of the undoubtedly weird 2024 election.\n\n___\n\nHanna reported from Topeka, Kansas.",

And while it has been my intention to seek re-election, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.\"\n\nAccording to a Reuters report, Tim Walz is known to have pushed agenda including free school meals, goals for tackling climate change, tax cuts for the middle class and expanded paid leave for Minnesota workers.\n\n\n\nALSO READ: Trump rips Biden & Harris as US recession fears spark selloff in global markets\n\nHarris is adding Walz, a Midwestern politician whose home state votes for Democrats in presidential elections but is close to battleground states Wisconsin and Michigan.\n\n\n\nWalz is known to be skilled in connecting with white, rural voters who in recent years have voted broadly for the Republican Donald Trump.\n\nThe Harris campaign is hoping for Walz's extensive National Guard career, coupled with a successful run as a high school football coach, and his Dad joke videos will attract such voters who are not yet dedicated to a second Trump term in the White House.",

        "text": "The Enduring Work of Protecting Voting Rights: 59 Years and Counting\nThe Justice Department once described the Voting Rights Act (VRA) as the most effective piece of civil rights legislation ever enacted. President Lyndon B. Johnson, when he signed the bill on Aug. 6, 1965, called it \u201cone of the most monumental laws in the entire history of American freedom.\u201d\n\nThe act has opened the door for more Americans to have voice in our democratic process. Sadly, though, opponents continue to undermine and obstruct access to the ballot. The Voting Rights Act is, as yet, a promise unfulfilled.\n\nJust last week, for example, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals contradicted its own precedent that has stood for 35 years when it overturned a lower court\u2019s ruling that a redistricting plan in Galveston County, Texas, violated Section 2 of the Act. The Court overruled its previous standard allowing politically cohesive Black and Latino voters to join together in claiming that an election system or districting plan denied them an equal opportunity to elect their candidates of choice.\n\nWhen signed into law, the VRA was the first legislation to forbid outright rules that denied voting rights on account of race or color. It also outlawed literacy tests, and it required jurisdictions to provide bilingual ballots if enough of their voters had limited English proficiency.\n\nImportantly, in Section 4(b), the act identified localities whose history of discrimination was egregious enough to warrant special oversight. Section 5 contained the consequential idea of preclearance: those identified localities would now have to submit potential voting rule changes for federal approval. They could no longer suppress votes at whim.\n\nFor almost half a century, this vital piece of legislation empowered the Justice Department to stop localities from obstructing voters of color from participating fully in the electoral process. Section 5 thwarted such barriers nearly 1,200 times.\n\nBut in 2013 the Supreme Court, in Shelby County v. Holder, found Section 4(b) of the VRA unconstitutional. Without it, Section 5\u2019s protective shield vanished. Shelby flung wide the floodgates to voter suppression, and opponents of representative democracy wasted no time in barreling through them.\n\nStates introduced restrictive voting measures the day of and in the days after Shelby, and they have continued to erode voting rights. Last year, the Brennan Center for Justice, a law and policy institute, declared that since 2013, nearly a hundred new laws have restricted voting rights, many in states previously identified by Section 4(b)\u2019s formula.\n\nAs a small sample, according to the Brennan Center, in 2021, at least 19 states passed 34 laws meant to abridge voting rights. In 2022, eight states passed 11 such laws and in 2023 at least 14 states passed 17.\n\nIn 2024, the barriers continue to mount.\n\nSome courts, seemingly unconstrained by either precedent or the language of the statute, have spurred on this destructive process with decisions that further curtail the protection of voting rights, fueling a surge of litigation assaults by state governments and others that even attack the constitutionality of Section 2, despite the Supreme Court decision upholding it in 2023.\n\nThese threats are grave, but the Justice Department\u2019s response is unstinting. As the actions below reveal, we vigorously confront voting discrimination.\n\nThe great heroes of the Civil Rights Movement, both leaders and foot soldiers, fought, bled and died to secure the precious right to vote. Now, in the courts, in the legislatures, and on the ground, we face deterioration of the voting rights that our forbearers sacrificed so much to win.\n\nWe call on you to become civil rights heroes. Report voting rights violations. Report threats against election workers. Speak out against efforts to restrict access to the polls.\n\nKnow that we will be there beside you. We will not shrink from the challenge. We will continue the struggle of those who came before us. We will honor their sacrifice. The stakes are too high; our freedom is too precious for anything less.",

        "text": "US presidential election: Kamala Harris on the sidelines of identity politics\nKamala Harris in Atlanta, Georiga, on July 30, 2024. JOHN BAZEMORE / AP\n\nFor the real launch of her campaign, on Tuesday, August 6, alongside her running mate for the first time, Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate in the American presidential election, chose the city of Philadelphia. As well as being in the crucial state of Pennsylvania, it is also the founding city of the American Republic, the glorious city where the Constitution was written in the summer of 1787.\n\nDemocrats like to refer to the text's preamble, as much for its opening words \"We the people of the United States\" as for what follows: \"In order to form a more perfect union.\" This expression is generally understood as aspiring to a form of social organization that the Founding Fathers, many of them slave owners, were unable to conceive: a multiracial democracy.\n\nBarack Obama came to Philadelphia to give his \"race speech\" on March 18, 2008. He had been forced to do so by the controversy created by the remarks of his pastor, Jeremiah Wright, violently condemning discrimination against Blacks. The candidate for the Democratic nomination in the November election distanced himself from this vision, while pleading, as he did throughout his presidency, for a \"more perfect union\" that would see the US assert its geopolitical advantage over the rest of the world by setting an example of the fulfillment of the American dream.\n\n'I am who I am'\n\nHarris, who supported Obama from the outset but reportedly hates being compared to him, has so far stuck to a different approach. As the first female district attorney of San Francisco; the first female attorney general of California, the country's most populous state; and the first female vice president of the US, the candidate seems in no hurry to play the identity card. When she talks about her ceiling-breaking career, as she did in her victory speech after the 2020 presidential election, it's often to quote the words of her mother, Indian-born oncology researcher Shyamala Gopan: \"You may be the first, but make sure you are not the last.\"\n\nWhen it comes to the race issue, she'd clearly rather avoid the subject. At 59, Harris isn't tormented by her identity. She defines herself as \"proudly American\" and leaves it to others to pigeonhole her if they care to. \"I am who I am,\" she told The Washington Post in 2015. \"I'm good with it.\" In 2020, on the Los Angeles Times podcast Asian Enough, she expressed her annoyance at having to explain things about herself that one wouldn't ask someone else to detail. \"I've never had an identity crisis,\" she said. \"The frustration I have is that people think I should have gone through such a crisis and need to explain it.\"\n\nYou have 67.75% of this article left to read.

        "text": "What are Kamala Harris' odds to be next U.S. president after Democratic National Convention?\nThe race for who will become the 47th president of the United States is on and heating up following the Democratic National Convention that took place last week at the United Center in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nThe betting odds have shifted in Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, favor following the DNC and naming Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate earlier this month.\n\nHere's the latest on who's the betting favorite to become the next President of the United States:\n\n*Disclaimer: Federal law prohibits political wagering in the United States, including the 2024 Presidential Election\n\n2024 Presidential election odds: Kamala Harris vs Donald Trump\n\nIn late July, former President Donald Trump was a massive -200 favorite (Bet $200 to win $100) on bet365 to be elected President of the United States for a second time while Harris sat at 2/1 (Bet $100 to win $200) in the betting market.\n\nThose numbers have now changed significantly.\n\nAs of Aug. 27, Harris (-120) now leads Trump (+100) to win the 2024 Presidential election, via bet365 on on Covers.com.\n\nThis boost for the current Vice President of the United States in not uncommon, as each side usually has the numbers go in their favor following a VP pick or when there's either the Democratic or Republican National Convention going on, with all four events in the rear view mirror and Election Day (Nov. 5) a little over two months away.\n\nEven though Harris is in the lead for now, don't be surprised if/when these odds to shift over the course of the next 10 weeks.\n\nAccuracy of Presidential elections odds in history\n\nAccording to the Conversation, the odds-on-favorite in the Presidential election has only lost twice since 1866.\n\nOne of those upsets was Trump himself, when he overcame 7/2 odds (22.22 implied win probability) to defeat Hilary Clinton, the Democratic nominee in the 2016 Presidential election.\n\nIf Harris and Walz can raise the numbers enough where they have the slight advantage coming out of Chicago, it could be their race to lose given the 158-year track record of the favorite becoming President.\n\nHowever, if Trump's still the odds-on-favorite come the end of the August, it will all but likely be his election to lose as he would become President of the United States for the second time in three terms.\n\nGannett may earn revenue from sports betting operators for audience referrals to betting services.

Here's which 5 states flipped from 2016 to 2020\nWith less than 100 days to the 2024 presidential election and both running mates selected, all eyes are again turning toward the Electoral College and the key states that may swing the election either for the Democrats or the Republicans.\n\nIt has been an election season full of twists and turns, from President Joe Biden dropping out of the race to Vice President Kamala Harris becoming the presumptive Democratic nominee and choosing Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as a running mate, to former President Donald Trump's assassination attempt and choosing Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his running mate.\n\nBut one thing still persists in presidential elections: the longstanding Electoral College, in which candidates will need a majority of 270 electoral votes to win the presidency.\n\nPrevious elections have come down to just a handful of states in order to gain the majority of electoral votes. Here's what happened in the 2016 and 2020 elections.\n\nTim Walz vs. JD Vance:How Kamala Harris, Donald Trump's VP picks match up\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nWhat are the swing states?\n\nThe following states flipped parties in the presidential election between 2016 and 2020:\n\nArizona\n\nWisconsin\n\nMichigan\n\nPennsylvania\n\nGeorgia\n\nNebraska distributes electoral votes proportionally, and it flipped one vote blue in 2020.\n\nNevada and North Carolina are also considered battleground states.\n\nWhat was the Electoral College map in 2016?\n\nFormer President Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton in 2016 with 306 electoral votes, winning swing states Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia and Arizona.\n\nWhat was the Electoral College map in 2020?\n\nPresident Joe Biden beat Trump in 2020 with 306 electoral votes, winning five swing states Trump took in the last election: Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia and Arizona.\n\nContributing: Kinsey Crowley, USA TODAY.",

        "text": "Filipino Americans: A Survey Data Snapshot\nFilipino Americans:\n\nA Survey Data Snapshot\n\nTagalog\n\nAbout 4.1 million Filipino Americans lived in the United States as of 2022, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Filipinos account for 17% of the nation\u2019s total Asian American population.\n\nUnlike most of the other major Asian origin groups, more Filipino Americans are U.S. born than immigrants (52% vs. 48%). Among Filipino immigrants, three-quarters (75%) are naturalized U.S. citizens \u2013 a higher share than among the other large Asian origin groups we studied, except Vietnamese Americans.\n\nRoughly four-in-ten Filipino Americans (1.6 million, or 38%) live in California, with the highest concentrations in the Los Angeles and San Francisco metropolitan areas. Other states with sizable numbers of Filipino Americans include Hawaii (270,000) and Texas (208,000).\n\nThe median income among Filipino American households was $100,600 in 2022, meaning that half of households headed by a Filipino American person earned more than that and half earned less. This is similar to the median household income among Asian Americans overall that year ($100,000).\n\nHere\u2019s a closer look at Filipino Americans\u2019 views on a range of topics, including how they describe their own identities and how they identify politically and religiously. These findings are based on a nationally representative Pew Research Center survey of 7,006 Asian adults in the U.S. \u2013 including 1,051 Filipino Americans \u2013 conducted in 2022 and 2023.\n\nIdentity\n\nFilipino Americans describe their identity in a variety of ways, as do Asian Americans overall. About six-in-ten (61%) say they most often describe themselves as \u201cFilipino\u201d or \u201cFilipino American.\u201d A fifth (20%) typically describe themselves as \u201cAsian American\u201d or \u201cAsian,\u201d while 13% most often call themselves \u201cAmerican.\u201d\n\nSome Filipino Americans say they have hidden a part of their heritage \u2013 such as cultural or religious practices \u2013 from people who are not Asian. In our survey, 16% say they have done this.\n\nViews of the U.S. and the Philippines\n\nFilipino Americans have broadly favorable views of the U.S. and the Philippines.\n\nAbout three-quarters of Filipino Americans (76%) have a very or somewhat favorable view of the U.S., and a similar share (72%) have a favorable opinion of the Philippines.\n\nAlthough a large majority of Filipino Americans have a favorable view of the Philippines, two-thirds say they wouldn\u2019t move there. Just 31% of Filipino adults in the U.S. say they\u2019d move to the Philippines, although that willingness varies significantly by where they were born. Filipino immigrants are about four times as likely as U.S.-born Filipino adults to say they would move to the Philippines (43% vs. 10%).\n\nAchieving the American dream\n\nMost Filipino Americans feel that they\u2019re either on their way to achieving the American dream or have already achieved it. About four-in-ten (41%) say they\u2019re on their way, while about three-in-ten (29%) say they\u2019ve already achieved it. However, 29% of Filipino Americans say the American dream is out of reach for them.\n\nPolitics\n\nMost Filipino American registered voters identify with or lean to the Democratic Party. About two-thirds of Filipino American voters (68%) are Democrats or lean Democratic, while 31% are Republicans or lean Republican. By comparison, among Asian American registered voters overall, 62% identify as or lean Democratic and 34% identify as or lean Republican.\n\nAs of 2022, two-thirds of all Filipino Americans \u2013 about 2.7 million people \u2013 were eligible to vote in the U.S., meaning they were at least 18 years old and citizens either through birth or naturalization, according to Census Bureau data.\n\nReligion\n\nFilipino Americans are more likely than the other large Asian American origin groups to say they are Christian. About three-quarters of Filipino Americans (74%) identify this way, including more than half (57%) who say they\u2019re Catholic. Smaller shares identify as evangelical Protestant (9%) and nonevangelical Protestant (7%). About a quarter of Filipino adults (23%) are not affiliated with any religion.\n\nPhoto by Paul Chinn/The San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images\n\nHow we did this This analysis is one in a seven-part series that explores the identities, views, attitudes and experiences of Asian Americans, including the six largest Asian origin groups in the U.S. In these analyses, Asian Americans include those who identify as Asian, either alone or in combination with other races or Hispanic ethnicity. The six Asian origin groups highlighted in this series \u2013 Chinese, Filipino, Indian, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese Americans \u2013 include those who identify with one Asian origin only, either alone or in combination with a non-Asian race or ethnicity. In this series, Chinese adults do not include those who self-identify as Taiwanese. Other Pew Research Center analyses exploring the attitudes and characteristics of Asian origin groups may use different definitions and therefore may not be directly comparable. This analysis is based on two data sources. The first is Pew Research Center\u2019s 2022-23 survey of Asian American adults, conducted from July 2022 to January 2023 in six languages among 7,006 respondents. The Center recruited a large sample to examine the diversity of the U.S. Asian population, with oversamples of the Chinese, Filipino, Indian, Korean and Vietnamese populations. These are the five largest origin groups among Asian Americans. The survey also includes a large enough sample of self-identified Japanese adults to make certain findings about them reportable. For more details, read the methodology. The second data source is the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s 2022 American Community Survey (ACS) provided through Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) from the University of Minnesota. Pew Research Center is a subsidiary of The Pew Charitable Trusts, its primary funder. The Center\u2019s Asian American portfolio was funded by The Pew Charitable Trusts, with generous support from The Asian American Foundation; Chan Zuckerberg Initiative DAF, an advised fund of the Silicon Valley Community Foundation; the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation; the Henry Luce Foundation; the Doris Duke Foundation; The Wallace H. Coulter Foundation; The Dirk and Charlene Kabcenell Foundation; The Long Family Foundation; Lu-Hebert Fund; Gee Family Foundation; Joseph Cotchett; the Julian Abdey and Sabrina Moyle Charitable Fund; and Nanci Nishimura. We would also like to thank the Leaders Forum for its thoughtful leadership and valuable assistance in helping make this survey possible. The strategic communications campaign used to promote the research was made possible with generous support from the Doris Duke Foundation.\n\nFind out more:",

        "text": "What does it mean to 'endorse' a presidential candidate?\nIn presidential election years, certain words pop up in our lookup data\u2014words that get dusted off for a short while before receding from the news, put back in the closet until we need them again. These words, like caucus, presumptive, and electoral college, are generally used infrequently, but election years make them, for a brief time, favorites among our lookups.\n\nAlthough \"endorse\" has been used in English for more than 600 years, the figurative meaning of \u201cto approve openly\u201d is much newer\n\nBut some words do the hard work year in and year out, rising in popularity during an election year because of a less common meaning that is temporarily prominent. Endorse is such a word. It carries a lot of meaning on its back, and for good reason: it comes from the Latin word dorsum, meaning \u201cback.\u201d\n\nDorsum is the root of dorsal, meaning \u201crelating to or situated near or on the back especially of an animal,\u201d as in dorsal fin. That literal meaning of \u201con the back\u201d is also the origin of endorse, which has meant \u201cto write on the back of a document\u201d in texts going back to before 1400. (Endorsement followed endorse in the mid-1500s.) For centuries the word's meanings were restricted to ones that required a writing implement, with the act of endorsing involving a simple signature (as in \u201cendorsing a check\u201d), or a more elaborate note functioning, for example, as approval of a military promotion.\n\nThe figurative meaning \u201cto approve openly\u201d or \u201cto express support or approval of openly and definitely\u201d is a relatively modern development, dating to the 1800s. An early use makes reference to the nominating convention of the Democratic Party in 1844, but could easily be imagined as a line from election coverage today; only the names would change:\n\nCol. Benton endorses Polk and Dallas, but almost directly denounces the Convention which nominated them.\n\n\u2014The Brooklyn Evening Star, 28 June 1844\n\nEndorsements involving approval weren\u2019t initially limited to political contexts; an early use by Ralph Waldo Emerson in 1847, cited in the Oxford English Dictionary, shows broader application, with ideas and authors enjoying endorsements as well:\n\nThis book of Montaigne the world has endorsed, by translating it into all tongues.\n\nWith its origins in binding legal documents at a time when the written word was precious and the tradition of written laws was being established in England, endorse has retained its strong meaning: putting your name behind a candidate means, figuratively, carrying that candidate\u2019s record, reputation, and actions on your back.",

        "text": "Stanford Scholars Discuss What\u2019s at Stake in the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election\nThe panelists began their election analysis with a discussion of the structural features of American democracy and then addressed the issues, strategies, and stakes central to November\u2019s race.\n\nCain began his remarks by highlighting a longstanding and escalating concern about the American democratic structure: tension between electability and governance. Rather, that the negative partisanship necessary during the election process has proven incompatible with the bipartisan negotiations required to govern. This, coupled with campaign finance \u2014 which, among other things, has complicated the incentive and power structures of political parties \u2014 has fueled inefficiency and political frustration.\n\nJefferson argued that a persistent feature of American democracy is the influence of race on political outcomes. While various identities may shape Americans' political attitudes and behaviors, race, he contended, is unparalleled in its impact. As one example, Black Americans have long been \"steadfast Democrats,\" while no Democratic Party nominee has received a majority of the white vote since 1964.\n\nReferring to comparative politics scholarship, Jefferson noted that, in some ways, the Republican Party functions as an \"ethnic party.\" He pointed out that Trump\u2019s success in generating and consolidating his base is directly tied to white identity politics. Trump has relied on grievance politics to gain power, speaking to white, middle-class American voters who feel left behind and resentful of what they believe is a changing racial order. Positioning himself as their spokesman and defender, Trump attempts to reassure these voters that, if he returns to power, he will defend their place in America's racial hierarchy.\n\nWhile Cain and Jefferson touched on American democracy\u2019s organizing features, Canes-Wrone brought the conversation back to the current election cycle, highlighting prediction models and key issues. The polls, Canes-Wrone believes, are accurate, yet with such slim confidence intervals, the election is still too close to call.\n\nContrary to popular portrayal in the media, historical evidence suggests that bounces from the convention and vice presidential picks are rarely pivotal, if impactful at all. However, qualifies Canes-Wrone, this cycle is unprecedented, leaving an opportunity for a break in the trend.\n\nMoving to discuss the issues, Canes-Wrone underscores that the candidates are following traditional political strategy \u2014 placing emphasis on the issues that favor them and de-emphasis on those that don\u2019t. The Harris campaign has focused its efforts on abortion rights and threats to democracy, whereas Trump remains fixated on immigration and the economy. Unfortunately for Harris, post-COVID inflation and immigration remain the top issues, and her position is further complicated by the inability to heavily criticize her own administration.\n\nTo conclude their remarks, the panelists turned to the issue of gender: is the United States really ready to have a woman in the presidency? Canes-Wrone remarked that while survey data indicates that gender bias on the issue has diminished, it is not yet zero. In other political offices, women now win at equal rates to men, but with one caveat \u2014 far more expertise is required. There also appears to be far more sexism attached to executive offices, a reality Trump is likely to exploit. Perhaps luckily for Harris, there is one traditional argument the Republican nominee may have difficulty leveraging against her: it's not so easy to argue that a former prosecutor isn't tough on crime.",

        "text": "Q&A: Law professor addresses Kamala Harris\u2019s unprecedented presidential campaign\nProfessor Sonia Gipson Rankin is a Professor of Law at The University of New Mexico School of Law. Her work focuses on the legal and justice implications of new technologies like artificial intelligence, implicit bias, and criminal justice reform, as well as racial justice and Black community empowerment.\n\nProfessor Sonia Gipson Rankin\n\nShe has spoken with numerous media outlets about U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019s role in President Joe Biden\u2019s White House administration, as well as Harris\u2019s own 2020 and 2024 presidential campaigns.\n\nQ: In such an unprecedented situation are there any legal concerns with having a democratic candidate that wasn't in the primaries?\n\nSo, there may be some legal challenges, but there are no legal concerns. The Democratic nominee will not be officially selected until the Democratic Convention later in August. There is nothing unlawful because though President Biden was the presumptive nominee, he was not yet the official nominee nor was he on any ballots before he said he was leaving the race. Each party decides how it would like to determine its nominee. The Democratic Party will hold a virtual roll call starting August 1st and Vice President Kamala Harris is running unopposed as no challenger met the thresholds required to challenge her. She received over 3,000 of the 4,000 pledged delegates. So, as of right now, we have not seen that there have been any legal concerns that might stop the process.\n\nQ: Within just a few days of President Joe Biden announcing he would not run for re-election, Vice President Kamala Harris raised more than $100 million. Why do you think there has been so much energy around a new potential Democratic candidate??\n\nA lot of the initial energy stems from the reason President Biden decided not to run for re-election. This is something that will be analyzed for years if not decades. What kind of pressure led to President Biden stepping down? It seemed that this process wasn't driven by \"the people\" but was a strange conversation between the media and certain elite groups. When you talk to actual voters, many feel that something odd was happening here. After President Biden stepped down from the top of the ticket, it naturally led to the question of who should take his place. This sparked swift and significant momentum within the Black community. Within hours of President Biden's tweet announcing his decision, 44,000 Black women, including myself, joined a Zoom call and raised over $1 million in just three or four hours, all focused on the idea of Vice President Harris leading the Democratic ticket. The following day, thousands of Black men also gathered on a Zoom call and raised another million dollars. These were regular people who felt that something was amiss and took action.\n\nPart of the reason the energy is moving so quickly is that, for the first time, we are truly hearing what the Black community thinks. Look back to President Biden's bid for the nomination in 2020: he lost state after state until he reached South Carolina, where there was a larger Black population. He won decisively there, and his entire trajectory changed. Every pundit said there was no hope until that point.\n\nWhen discussions arose about President Biden stepping down, there were also murmurs about rewriting the entire ticket. I believe that a significant reason behind the support for Vice President Harris is the recognition that this process needed to reflect the people's interests. She's got a number of years of experience, and a lot of these factors are leading to a lot of this support.\n\nQ: How does Harris\u2019s current presidential campaign differ from her campaign in 2020?\n\nI think the person we have today before us, Vice President Harris, the candidate today, is different than Senator Harris, the candidate of yesteryear. The last time she ran for president, she was a U.S. senator from California with extensive experiences as the state\u2019s attorney general and a prosecutor. She had significant accomplishments for her state. Now, she has traveled to almost as many countries as President Biden, participated in numerous decision-making meetings with him, has been at the helm of various legislative initiatives, and has cast deciding votes in the Senate as the Vice President of the United States. She has engaged in policy discussions with the president and has been a vocal advocate in those crucial spaces. This is someone who understands how the inner workings of what it takes to be President of the United States.\n\nQ: If Harris receives the Democratic nomination, what \u201cfirsts\u201d would she be as a major party candidate?\n\nThere are several. At a minimum, she would be:\n\nFirst Black woman\n\nFirst East Indian American person\n\nFirst Southeast Asian person\n\nFirst Historically Black College or University graduate\n\nCongresswoman Shirley Chisholm, the first Black woman to run for US President in 1972, passed away in 2005. Before she died, she shared her belief that within the next ten to twenty-five years, there would be a woman president. She predicted that this woman would likely serve as Vice President first. Secretary Hillary Clinton was the Democratic nominee in 2016, and Vice President Kamala Harris is a likely nominee for 2024. We are witnessing Chisholm's prediction unfold before our eyes.\n\nQ: What campaign challenges will Harris face as a candidate representing many groups for the first time?\n\nI think she's addressing two things. First, to be the first in many of these positions. But more critically, to ensure she is not the last, right? She wants people to see that not only they but also their children and grandchildren can have these opportunities. This is about showing that no matter your cultural background or religious practices, your journey is part of the American story, and you too can be part of its success and well-being.\n\nThere's a reason she can talk about recipes familiar in both the United States and India and navigate comfortably in various collegiate and cultural settings. Her story is part of the American story. She\u2019ll focus on the message: \u201cI may not share your lived experience, but my role as president is to ensure you reach the goals you have for your family.\u201d The conversation will shift from her being the first to emphasizing that because she's in this space, she can help elevate others' paths and prospects in this country.\n\nQ: If Harris receives the Democratic nomination, she will be the second woman to ever be nominated as a presidential candidate by a major U.S. political party. What campaign challenges does that present and what should voters watch for?\n\nSo many women in the United States and probably around the world have experienced the feeling that there is always something wrong with simply being themselves. You can stand in one place, and someone will say she's too tall, while another will say she's too short. One person will say she's too fat, and another will say she's too skinny. Some will say she's not smiling enough, and others will say she's smiling too much. All you can respond with is, \u201cI haven't moved an inch. How can I be wrong in every single aspect of simply being me?\u201d\n\nWhat we're going to really watch happen is that there can be serious concerns about policy issues, but it's going to often be coupled and tied into her lived experience as a Black East Indian American woman in the United States who grew up in California and has stepchildren. We're going to see people attempting to link her policy ideas to her identity, which is already devolving into terrible statements about her intelligence and fitness to serve. It's crucial for everyone to be intentional about calling out these instances of anti-Blackness and anti-woman rhetoric as they occur, stopping them immediately every single time.\n\nQ: We haven\u2019t had someone begin a major party Presidential campaign this late into the election season before. What challenges will Harris face making a bid for the Democratic nomination and the presidency this late into the election year?\n\nThere will always be the complexity of how we introduce candidates to the American people. There are historical plans. There have long been rule books and the method of how one runs for president. Candidates are expected to attend a certain number of events in specific states at particular times of the year to be seen and heard. Small town meetings, house events, gatherings in particular spaces. There's not enough time to do those things.\n\nWe\u2019re not going to have the time to do some of those traditional campaign activities. Right now, there\u2019s a lot of groundwork and coalition-building that needs to happen. Now they will shift quickly from \u201cCan this person motivate some?\u201d to \u201cCan these newly motivated people encourage others to go to the polls?\u201d Though the election is in November, early voting starts weeks in advance. It's almost time for people to start casting their ballots.\n\n. All of those things are going to have to happen right away. However, we are dealing with a skilled former prosecutor. This is an individual who not only got pretty complex legal training but has also learned what it means to be in a courtroom, to have to very succinctly explain their position to a jury of twelve people in the community, from all different types of backgrounds, to get a point across. Someone who is accustomed to working with judges understands the need to quickly change the conversation or present different points of evidence as required. They are always prepared to present their position, no matter the circumstances. This person has experience collaborating with opposing counsel to reach goals and make decisions. That is just in addition to all the other kinds of skills she's developed. She\u2019s already trained on how to pivot, how to explain her point, and how to do that in a time-restricted manner.\n\nQ: What else should voters keep in mind or anticipate as the presidential campaigns and election season continue to unfold?\n\nOne crucial aspect for people to consider is identifying where the Biden administration ends and where a Harris administration would begin. This distinction will be significant. We\u2019ve already seen an example when she made a statement about the Israel-Palestine situation, showcasing a different stance from President Biden. So, she's starting to highlight these distinctions, indicating where she might have made different policy decisions and taken different approaches.\n\nAnother element to consider is reviewing her work experience. What were her accomplishments as a prosecutor, attorney general, senator, and vice president? She needs to highlight specific examples that demonstrate her thinking and how she will act for the people. Her campaign will be working diligently on this in the next two or three weeks. Additionally, we will learn a lot once her vice-presidential nominee is selected. This choice will indicate which parts of the country are in play, and which are not. We'll also need to watch for changes in polls and who gets contacted for them Even more critically, we must consider the impact that new voting restrictions across the country might have on voter turnout in the election.\n\nQ: How will New Mexico be impacted by this election?\n\nFor us in New Mexico, we're going to be watching the entire election very carefully because of how closely tied we are to the federal government. Many aspects of New Mexico help fuel the federal government and vice versa. Whatever happens in D.C. will directly impact New Mexico, making this a very important election. You can expect to see the candidates making their way here this coming fall.\n\nLearn more about issues impacting the 2024 election directly from UNM faculty experts on elections.unm.edu.",

In the 24 hours that followed, Harris\u2019 campaign raised more than $81 million, which according to the campaign was the largest single-day total raised in U.S. history.\n\nWelcome to the unconventional and unpredictable world of campaign finance.\n\nIt\u2019s a world that Robin Kolodny, professor of political science at Temple University\u2019s College of Liberal Arts, knows well. Her new book, The Fundamentals of Campaign Finance in the U.S.: Why We Have the System We Have, offers a detailed look at the U.S. campaign finance system as it presently stands. The book is more than a historic retelling of campaign finance. Rather, it considers the campaign finance system in the context of the broader U.S. political and economic system while outlining the various factors that have led the system to become what it currently is.\n\n\u201cWithin the book, we\u2019re telling a continual story of campaign finance policy change and reactions to it. This book is not a call for reform, because both of us are pretty much resigned to the fact that we have some fundamental drivers in our political system who want us to continue with the policies we have in place,\u201d Kolodny said. \u201cThe cover of the book is a Jenga tower that\u2019s nearly falling over, and the point, of course, is that while we have a bare regulatory system now, what happens when one or two planks move? The whole thing could come tumbling down, and you might not have any regulation at all.\u201d\n\nRecently released by the University of Michigan Press, the new book was co-authored by Diana Dwyre, a professor of political science at California State University Chico. It is presently available for purchase on the University of Michigan Press\u2019 website as well as Amazon. However, through Amazon, it can also be downloaded instantly for free to a Kindle device, and the book is also available for free online via open access.\n\nWritten for people with little or no familiarity with federal campaign finance, Kolodny and Dwyre explain why we have a privately funded system, what candidates need to run campaigns and why donors choose to give their money to politics. Along the way, they explain how we now have so many different types of organizations raising and spending money, and how the changing judicial philosophy about what is important in elections led to the weakening of two landmark campaign finance laws.\n\n\u201cIt took candidates, parties, interest groups and the courts about 30 years to do serious damage to the spirit of the 1971 and 1974 FECA laws before legislators tried to remedy some of it through BCRA [Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]. It took only 12 years, from BCRA\u2019s passage in 2002 to the McCutcheon decision in 2014, to essentially gut it,\u201d Kolodny and Dwyre write in chapter four.\n\nWithin the book, Kolodny also works to correct several misconceptions regarding campaign finance.\n\nFor instance, most folks often assume those with the most campaign spending or campaign donations have the most influence over political leaders. In actuality, different economic factors carry the most influence.\n\n\u201cTake the city of Philadelphia, for example,\u201d Kolodny said. \u201cIf the president of Comcast asks for a meeting with Mayor Cherelle Parker, the mayor is not going to take that meeting dependent on whether the Comcast has previously made campaign contributions. The mayor is going to take that meeting because Comcast is the largest private employer in Philadelphia. The structural power of businesses, especially in cities like Philadelphia, has way more outside influence than a person or entity who makes a campaign donation.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Kolodny cautioned that a particular individual\u2019s donation track record might not necessarily indicate where their political leanings lie.\n\n\u201cI always like to use the example of (Philadelphia Eagles owner) Jeffrey Lurie. If you looked at his campaign donations, you would assume that he is an enormous Democrat. Similarly, if you looked at the donations of (Houston Texans owner) Cal McNair, you would assume he is a huge Republican,\u201d Kolodny said. \u201cThe reality is that most of their donations are within a 150-mile radius of where their stadium resides, and they are just supporting the legislators that have jurisdiction of that 150-mile radius. Their donations are supporting the status quo, because they do not want things to change, because why would they? Change might not be good for business.\u201d\n\nOver the next several months and through the presidential election in early November, campaign finance is sure to be widely discussed in the news, which makes Kolodny\u2019s new book and its findings even more relevant.\n\nFor instance, since Harris was named the presumptive presidential candidate for the Democratic Party, former President Donald Trump has filed an FEC complaint alleging that if Harris receives the campaign funds that were previously made to Biden, it is a violation of federal law. Kolodny doesn\u2019t expect the complaint to go very far.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that Kamala\u2019s name was on the ticket from the very start. This was the Biden-Harris ticket,\u201d Kolodny said. \u201cPlus, these types of changes get approved all the time. Even if there were to be legs to this, it would not get sorted out until months after the election is already over.\u201d",

Among likely voters, Harris is the choice of 50% and Trump the choice of 49%. These results include initially undecided voters who were then asked whom they would vote for if they had to choose.\n\nIn June, before the debate between President Joe Biden and Trump and with Biden as the Democratic candidate, Biden and Trump each received 50% among Wisconsin registered voters, while Biden received 51% and Trump 49% among likely voters.\n\nIn a multicandidate race, Harris, a Democrat, is the choice of 45% and Trump, a Republican, 43%. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. receives 8%, Libertarian Chase Oliver 1%, Green Party candidate Jill Stein 1%, Constitution Party candidate Randall Terry <0.5%, and independent Cornel West <0.5%, among registered voters. Among likely voters, it is Harris 46%, Trump 45%, Kennedy 6%, Oliver 1%, Stein 1%, Terry <0.5%, and West <0.5%.\n\nIn the U.S. Senate race, Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin is supported by 53% to Republican Eric Hovde\u2019s 46% among registered voters. Among likely voters, Baldwin receives 52% and Hovde receives 47%. These results include initially undecided voters who were then asked whom they would vote for if they had to choose. On the initial question, before that \u201cif you had to choose\u201d follow-up, Baldwin receives 47%, Hovde 39%, and 14% say they are undecided, among registered voters.\n\nWhen the Senate ballot includes independent candidates, Baldwin receives 50%, Hovde receives 44%, Phil Anderson (the \u201cDisrupt the Corruption\u201d party candidate) receives 2% and Thomas Leager, of the \u201cAmerica First\u201d party, receives 2%, among registered voters. Among likely voters, Baldwin receives 51% and Hovde 45%, with 2% each for Anderson and Leager.\n\nThe survey was conducted July 24-Aug. 1, 2024, interviewing 877 Wisconsin registered voters, with a margin of error of +/-4.6 percentage points. The poll included 801 likely voters, with a margin of error of +/-4.8 percentage points. (All results are stated as percentages.)\n\nWhile the race for president remains very close in Wisconsin, when asked who they think is likely to win in November, 51% say Trump will definitely or probably win, while 39% say Harris will definitely or probably win and 11% say they don\u2019t know.\n\nThe perceived chances of Biden winning, had he stayed in the race, are lower than the perceived chances with Harris as the candidate. Asked about the winner between Biden and Trump, 20% say Biden would definitely or probably win, while 69% say Trump would win.\n\nA substantial majority (79%) say Biden should have withdrawn from the race, while 15% say he should have continued as the Democratic nominee. Among Democrats, 91% say Biden should have withdrawn.\n\nAsked whom they would have voted for if Biden remained in the race, 42% say Biden, 47% say Trump, and 10% say they don\u2019t know.\n\nA majority (58%) say Biden should not resign but should serve out his term as president, while 33% say he should resign and 9% say they don\u2019t know.\n\nDemocrats are overwhelmingly satisfied with Harris as the nominee, with 92% very or somewhat satisfied with her as the nominee and 7% very or somewhat dissatisfied.\n\nThe poll was completed before she secured the nomination through a virtual roll call of delegates on Aug. 2. A majority (54%) of Democrats think the party should settle on a nominee before the convention, while almost a third (32%) say there should be an open convention and 13% don\u2019t know.\n\nFavorability to candidates\n\nHarris is seen in this survey favorably by 41% and unfavorably by 53% of registered voters, with 6% saying they don\u2019t know enough about her to have an opinion. When this question was last asked about Harris in June 2022, 36% had a favorable opinion and 49% had an unfavorable view, with 15% who did not have an opinion of her.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz was chosen as the Democratic nominee for vice president after the poll was completed.\n\nIn this survey, following the July 13 assassination attempt against Trump and the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee July 15-18, favorability toward Trump in Wisconsin rose to 44%, with 54% unfavorable and 2% without an opinion. In June, his favorability was 41%, with 57% unfavorable and 2% lacking an opinion.\n\nFavorability toward Biden was unchanged from June, following his withdrawal from the presidential race, remaining at 40% favorable, while his unfavorable rating declined one percentage point to 57%.\n\nThose with unfavorable opinions of both candidates\u2014the so-called \u201cdouble haters\u201d\u2014declined slightly in July. For Biden and Trump, 17% were unfavorable to both in June. That group declined to 14% in July. For Harris and Trump, 11% have an unfavorable view of both in July.\n\nRepublican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance is seen favorably by 31% and unfavorably by 41%, with 29% saying they haven\u2019t heard enough or don\u2019t know. Vance is seen much more favorably by Republicans, but is viewed unfavorably by independents and especially Democrats, as shown in Table 1. Substantial percentages of each partisan group, and especially independents, say they have not yet formed an opinion of Vance.\n\nTable 1: Vance favorability, by party identification\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nParty ID Favorability Favorable Unfavorable Haven't heard enough Don't know Republican 63 8 28 1 Independent 13 31 55 0 Democrat 1 78 20 1 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, July 24-Aug. 1, 2024 Question: Do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of [name] or haven't you heard enough about them yet?\n\nVance is seen as an excellent pick for the vice-presidential slot by 17%, as a good choice by 25%, as a fair choice by 10%, and as a poor selection by 35%, with 14% who say they don\u2019t know. More than three-quarters of Republicans rate the choice of Vance as excellent or good, while independents are more divided and more than two-thirds of Democrats rate it poor, as shown in Table 2.\n\nTable 2: Vance as VP, by party identification\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nParty ID Rate choice of Vance as VP Excellent Good Fair Poor Don't know Republican 32 45 7 8 8 Independent 8 23 23 17 28 Democrat 3 4 9 68 16 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, July 24-Aug. 1, 2024 Question: How would you rate Trump\u2019s choice of Vance for vice president? Would you rate this choice as excellent, good, fair, or poor?\n\nEnthusiasm and likelihood of voting\n\nEnthusiasm about voting in November increased sharply from June to July, as shown in Table 4. In the current survey, 61% say they are very enthusiastic about voting, a substantial increase from 46% in June. This was the first substantial movement in enthusiasm in 2024, with fewer than 50% in all prior Marquette Law School Poll surveys of Wisconsin voters in 2024 saying they were very enthusiastic. For comparison, in the previous presidential cycle in early August 2020, 62% were very enthusiastic, basically the same level as now matched for the first time in 2024, but such enthusiasm was also seen in earlier Marquette Law School Poll surveys in 2020, unlike this year.\n\nTable 4: Enthusiasm to vote in November election\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPoll dates Enthusiasm Very Somewhat Not too Not at all 7/24-8/1/24 61 21 15 4 6/12-20/24 46 21 19 14 4/3-10/24 47 22 18 12 1/24-31/24 49 25 17 9 10/26-11/2/23 46 28 19 6 8/4-9/20 62 20 8 9 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, latest: July 24-Aug. 1, 2024 Question: (2024) How enthusiastic are you about voting in the elections in November 2024 for president and other offices? Would you say you are very, somewhat, not too, or not at all enthusiastic? Question: (2020) How enthusiastic are you about voting in this November\u2019s elections? Would you say you are very, somewhat, not too, or not at all enthusiastic?\n\nEnthusiasm has increased primarily among Democrats and, to a lesser degree, among independents and Republicans. Republicans had a substantial enthusiasm advantage over Democrats in previous polls in 2024, but that has been mostly erased now, as shown in Table 5.\n\nTable 5: Enthusiasm to vote in November election, by party identification\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPoll dates Enthusiasm Very Somewhat Not too Not at all Democrat 7/24-8/1/24 62 19 15 4 6/12-20/24 40 24 20 16 Independent 7/24-8/1/24 37 20 26 17 6/12-20/24 30 17 23 29 Republican 7/24-8/1/24 64 22 12 1 6/12-20/24 57 19 16 8 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, latest: July 24-Aug. 1, 2024 Question: (2024) How enthusiastic are you about voting in the elections in November 2024 for president and other offices? Would you say you are very, somewhat, not too, or not at all enthusiastic?\n\nThose who are very enthusiastic give Trump a slight edge over Harris, while those somewhat enthusiastic give Harris an even slighter edge. Those who are not too enthusiastic and those not at all enthusiastic give Harris larger margins, as shown in Table 6.\n\nTable 6: Vote for Harris or Trump, by enthusiasm\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nEnthusiasm Vote choice 2024 Kamala Harris Donald Trump Haven't decided Refused Very enthusiastic 47 52 0 0 Somewhat enthusiastic 50 49 2 0 Not too enthusiastic 55 43 2 0 Not at all enthusiastic 60 36 4 0 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, July 24-Aug. 1, 2024 Question: If the 2024 election for president were held today between Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democrat, and Former President Donald Trump, the Republican, would you vote for Kamala Harris or for Donald Trump or haven\u2019t you decided? Question: If you had to choose, would you vote for Harris or for Trump? Question: How enthusiastic are you about voting in the elections in November 2024 for president and other offices? Would you say you are very, somewhat, not too, or not at all enthusiastic?\n\nIn June, with Biden as the Democratic candidate, this enthusiasm gap was much more pronounced, as shown in Table 7. At that time, Trump held a larger margin with the very enthusiastic than he now holds over Harris among that group, and Biden had larger margins over Trump with all other enthusiasm groups than Harris now holds.\n\nTable 7: Vote for Biden or Trump, by enthusiasm, June 2024\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nEnthusiasm Vote choice 2024 Joe Biden Donald Trump Haven't decided/Neither Very enthusiastic 39 61 0 Somewhat enthusiastic 57 43 0 Not too enthusiastic 58 41 1 Not at all enthusiastic 65 33 1 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, June 12-20, 2024 Question: If the 2024 election for president were held today between President Joe Biden, the Democrat, and Former President Donald Trump, the Republican, would you vote for Joe Biden or for Donald Trump or haven\u2019t you decided? Question: If you had to choose, would you vote for Biden or for Trump? Question: How enthusiastic are you about voting in the elections in November 2024 for president and other offices? Would you say you are very, somewhat, not too, or not at all enthusiastic?\n\nCharacteristics of Harris, Trump, and Biden\n\nThe replacement of Biden by Harris has changed the relative perceptions of the candidates, with Harris having different perceived traits from Biden. Table 8 shows which phrases describe Harris, Trump, and Biden. The Biden numbers are from the June poll while Harris and Trump perceptions are from July, the new survey.\n\nTable 8: How well does this phrase describe Harris or Trump or Biden\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nCandidate How well phrase describes Very/somewhat well Not too/not at all well Is too old to be president Harris 12 87 Trump 59 40 Biden 76 24 Shares your values Harris 51 49 Trump 46 54 Biden 43 57 Has behaved corruptly Harris 37 62 Trump 62 37 Biden 46 53 Strong record of accomplishments Harris 44 55 Trump 54 46 Biden 43 57 Has the right temperament to be president Harris 56 43 Trump 42 58 Biden 52 48 Is a strong leader Harris 50 50 Trump 58 42 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, July 24-Aug. 1, 2024 (Note: Biden items asked in June. Strong leader was not asked in June.) Question: How well does each of the following phrases describe (Kamala Harris)(Donald Trump)(Joe Biden)?\n\nRespondents were also asked if Harris and Trump have the communication skills to succeed as president. For Harris, 52% say she does have the skills needed and 39% say she does not, while 9% say they don\u2019t know. For Trump, 49% say he has the communication skills to succeed as president, while 49% say he does not and 1% say they don\u2019t know. This has not been asked about Biden.\n\nWith respect to his New York criminal trial in May, 52% say Trump was guilty as the jury found, while 36% say he is not guilty and the jury made the wrong ruling. Eleven percent don\u2019t know.\n\nTrump is scheduled to be sentenced in September. In July, 28% say he should be given no penalty at all, 11% say a fine only, 11% say probation without jail, 38% say he should be sentenced to jail, and 12% don\u2019t know.\n\nIssues in the presidential campaign\n\nTable 9 shows which candidate it is thought would do a better job on each of eight issues. Trump is seen as better on immigration and border security, the Israel-Hamas war, and the economy, and holds a slight edge on handling foreign relations. Harris is seen as better on abortion policy, health care, ensuring fair and accurate elections, and on Medicare and Social Security.\n\nBetween 8% and 20% say both candidates would be about the same or that neither would be good on each issue.\n\nTable 9: Which candidate would do a better job on issues\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nIssue Who better Harris Trump Both about the same Neither good Immigration and border security 36 52 6 5 Israel-Hamas war 33 47 7 13 The economy 39 51 6 3 Foreign relations 44 47 4 4 Medicare & Social Security 48 39 9 4 Ensuring fair and accurate elections 47 36 9 7 Health care 49 36 10 5 Abortion policy 53 34 6 6 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, July 24-Aug. 1, 2024 Question: Do you think Kamala Harris or Donald Trump would do a better job handling each of the following issues, they are both about the same or would neither be good on the issue?\n\nMost important issues\n\nRespondents were asked which of the eight issues would be most important for deciding their vote. The economy is the top-rated issue, followed by abortion policy, and immigration, with Medicare and Social Security as fourth most important, as shown in Table 10.\n\nTable 10: Most important issue\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nMost important issue Response Percent The economy 38 Abortion policy 14 Immigration and border security 13 Medicare & Social Security 9 Health care 7 Ensuring fair and accurate elections 6 The war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza 3 Foreign relations 2 Don't know 7 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, July 24-Aug. 1, 2024 Question: Which one of the following issues will be MOST important in deciding your vote for president?\n\nPartisans differ on the most important issues, as shown in Table 11. Republicans are much more likely to rank the economy and immigration as most important, while placing little weight on any of the other issues. Independents rank the economy as most important with no other issue reaching double digits. Democrats put abortion policy as their top concern, followed by Medicare and Social Security with the economy third. Only 1% of Democrats rank immigration as their top issue concern, as do 7% of independents.\n\nTable 11: Most important issue, by party identification\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nParty ID Issue The economy Immigration and border security Health care Foreign relations Abortion policy Medicare & Social Security The war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza Ensuring fair and accurate elections Don't know Republican 55 26 2 2 5 2 0 3 5 Independent 45 7 9 3 7 7 6 2 14 Democrat 17 1 13 1 26 18 5 11 8 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, July 24-Aug. 1, 2024 Question: Which one of the following issues will be MOST important in deciding your vote for president?\n\nSupport for deporting immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally varies depending on the framing of the issue. A random half-sample of the survey was asked:\n\nDo you favor or oppose deporting immigrants who are living in the United States illegally back to their home countries?\n\nWith this wording, 64% favor deportation and 34% are opposed, with 2% who say they don\u2019t know.\n\nThe other half-sample was asked:\n\nDo you favor or oppose deporting immigrants who are living in the United States illegally back to their home countries even if they have lived here for a number of years, have jobs, and no criminal record?\n\nWhen worded this way, 44% favor deportations and 55% are opposed, with a half-percent who don\u2019t know.\n\nTwo-thirds of registered voters say abortion should be legal in all or most cases. and one third say it should be illegal in all or most cases. This has changed little since Roe v. Wade was overturned in June 2022. The full trend is shown in Table 12.\n\nTable 12: Abortion opinion trend\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPoll dates Opinion Legal in all cases Legal in most cases Illegal in most cases Illegal in all cases Don't know 7/24-8/1/24 33 34 27 5 1 6/12-20/24 34 32 26 8 0 4/3-10/24 28 36 26 9 1 6/8-13/23 32 34 25 6 1 8/10-15/22 30 35 25 5 3 6/14-20/22 27 31 24 11 5 10/26-31/21 23 38 23 11 4 2/19-23/20 18 37 22 15 6 10/24-28/18 26 29 24 14 4 9/12-16/18 26 36 21 9 6 7/11-15/18 27 36 18 11 6 10/23-26/14 24 34 24 15 3 10/21-24/13 26 36 25 10 2 10/25-28/12 28 32 23 12 4 10/11-14/12 25 34 25 12 3 9/27-30/12 25 35 23 12 3 9/13-16/12 26 34 23 13 3 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, latest: July 24-Aug. 1, 2024 Question: Do you think abortion should be legal in all cases, legal in most cases, illegal in most cases, or illegal in all cases?\n\nMulticandidate vote trends\n\nThe trend in vote preference including independent and third-party candidates is shown in Table 13. Oliver was not included prior to the June poll and Terry appears for the first time in July. The total third-party vote has declined in the poll\u2019s surveys, from 22% in January to 10% now, with Kennedy falling from 16% to 8% over that time among registered voters.\n\nTable 13: Vote including third-party candidates\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPoll dates Vote choice Biden/Harris Trump Kennedy Oliver Stein Terry West Don't know Registered voters 7/24-8/1/24 45 43 8 1 1 <.5 <.5 0 6/12-20/24 40 43 8 2 2 n/a 4 1 4/3-10/24 40 41 13 n/a 3 n/a 2 1 1/24-31/24 37 40 16 n/a 4 n/a 2 1 Likely voters 7/24-8/1/24 46 45 6 1 1 <.5 <.5 0 6/12-20/24 42 44 7 1 2 n/a 3 1 4/3-10/24 41 42 12 n/a 3 n/a 1 1 1/24-31/24 39 41 13 n/a 4 n/a 2 1 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, latest: July 24-Aug. 1, 2024 Question: If the presidential ballot included additional candidates, would you vote for Democrat Kamala Harris, Republican Donald Trump, independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr, Libertarian Chase Oliver, the Green Party\u2019s Jill Stein, Constitution Party\u2019s Randall Terry, or independent Cornel West? Note: Prior to July the vote choice asked about Joe Biden.\n\nIn the multicandidate ballot test in July, Kennedy takes more votes from Republicans (10%) than from Democrats (4%).\n\nIndependent voters are more drawn to the third-party candidates than are Republican or Democratic voters. Kennedy receives 21% from independents, Oliver 3%, Stein 2%, Terry <0.5%, and West 1%. This remains a minority of independent voters; among independents in the multicandidate race, Trump receives 38% and Harris 35%.\n\nThese results are shown in Table 14.\n\nTable 14: Multicandidate ballot, by party identification\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nParty ID Vote choice Biden/Harris Trump Kennedy Oliver Stein Terry West Don't know 7/24-8/1/24 Republican 4 85 10 <.5 <.5 <.5 <.5 0 Independent 35 38 21 3 2 <.5 1 0 Democrat 91 1 4 2 2 <.5 <.5 0 6/12-20/24 Republican 2 86 6 2 1 n/a 2 1 Independent 21 32 26 4 9 n/a 8 1 Democrat 85 2 6 1 2 n/a 4 0 4/3-10/24 Republican 4 79 13 n/a 3 n/a <.5 1 Independent 23 32 32 n/a 5 n/a 4 5 Democrat 85 1 8 n/a 4 n/a 2 0 1/24-31/24 Republican 5 76 16 n/a 1 n/a 1 0 Independent 33 27 28 n/a 3 n/a 4 2 Democrat 73 5 12 n/a 8 n/a 2 1 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, latest: July 24-Aug. 1, 2024 Question: If the presidential ballot included additional candidates, would you vote for Democrat Kamala Harris, Republican Donald Trump, independent Robert F.

Note: Prior to July the vote choice asked about Joe Biden.\n\nSenate vote by party identification\n\nAs shown in Table 15, among registered voters who identify as Democrats (or who lean), Baldwin receives 98% and Hovde 2%. Among Republicans, Hovde holds 88%, while Baldwin takes 11%. Independents favor Baldwin by 52% to Hovde\u2019s 46%.\n\nWith likely voters, partisan loyalty is slightly higher for both parties, but independents favor Hovde with 50% and 48% for Baldwin\n\nTable 15: Vote for Baldwin or Hovde\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nParty ID Vote choice Tammy Baldwin Eric Hovde Haven't decided Registered voters Republican 11 88 1 Independent 52 46 1 Democrat 98 2 1 Likely voters Republican 9 91 0 Independent 48 50 2 Democrat 99 1 0 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, July 24-Aug. 1, 2024 Question: If the 2024 election for U.S. Senate were held today between (Eric Hovde, the Republican), and (Tammy Baldwin, the Democrat), would you vote for (Eric Hovde) or for (Tammy Baldwin) or haven\u2019t you decided? Question: If you had to choose, would you vote for (Hovde) or for (Baldwin?)\n\nThe multicandidate Senate vote by party identification in July is shown in Table 16. Third-party candidate support is highest among independents and lowest among Democrats.\n\nTable 16: Multicandidate Senate vote\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nParty ID Vote choice Baldwin Hovde Anderson Leager Don't know Registered voters Republican 8 88 2 2 0 Independent 42 34 9 7 8 Democrat 96 2 1 1 0 Likely voters Republican 8 89 2 2 0 Independent 44 36 9 8 2 Democrat 98 <.5 <.5 <.5 0 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin survey, July 24-Aug. 1, 2024 Question: If the U.S. Senate ballot included additional candidates, would you vote for Democrat Tammy Baldwin, Republican Eric Hovde, Disrupt the Corruption Party\u2019s Phil Anderson, or America First Party\u2019s Thomas Leage?\n\nSenate candidate favorability\n\nIn the current survey, Baldwin\u2019s favorable rating is 44% and her unfavorable rating is also 44%, with 12% saying they don\u2019t know enough about her. Since January, Baldwin\u2019s favorable rating has increased two points and her unfavorable has decreased by one percentage point.\n\nHovde is seen favorably by 24% and unfavorably by 37%, with 38% who haven\u2019t heard enough. The number of those without an opinion of Hovde has declined from 82% in January to 38% in July. In that time, his favorable rating has increased by 17 percentage points and his unfavorable by 28 percentage points.\n\nThese favorability trends are shown in Table 17.\n\nTable 17: Favorability to Senate candidates\n\nAmong registered voters\n\nPoll dates Favorability Net favorable Favorable Unfavorable Haven't heard enough Tammy Baldwin 7/24-8/1/24 0 44 44 12 6/12-20/24 1 45 44 11 4/3-10/24 5 47 42 11 1/24-31/24 -3 42 45 13 10/26-11/2/23 -2 41 43 15 6/8-13/23 3 40 37 22 Eric Hovde 7/24-8/1/24 -13 24 37 38 6/12-20/24 -9 23 32 44 4/3-10/24 -5 19 24 56 1/24-31/24 -2 7 9 82 6/8-13/23 -4 4 8 85 Marquette Law School Poll, Wisconsin surveys, latest: July 24-Aug. 1, 2024 Question: Do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of (INSERT NAME) or haven't you heard enough about them yet?\n\nBiden and Trump presidential job approval\n\nBiden\u2019s job approval in July stands at 42%, with disapproval at 57%\u00ad\u2014\u00ad\u00adlittle changed since June.

The survey was conducted July 24-Aug. 1, 2024, interviewing 877 Wisconsin registered voters, with a margin of error of +/-4.6 percentage points. The sample contains 801 likely voters, those who say they are absolutely certain to vote in November, with a margin of error of +/-4.8 percentage points.\n\nThe survey was conducted with a hybrid sample of 653 respondents selected from the Wisconsin voter registration list and 224 selected from the SSRS Opinion Panel, a sample drawn from postal addresses across the state and invited to take part in surveys online. The interview was conducted online with 737 respondents and with 140 by telephone with a live interviewer. Full details of the methodology are contained in the methodology statement at the link below.\n\nThe partisan makeup of the sample is 31% Republican, 29% Democratic, and 40% independent. Since January 2020, the long-term partisan balance has been 30% Republican and 29% Democratic, with 40% independent. The entire questionnaire, methodology statement, full results and breakdowns by demographic groups are available at law.marquette.edu/poll/results-and-data.",

        "text": "24 things Donald Trump is promising to do\nThe latter is where we want to focus today: What Trump is saying he will do.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is known for his off-script moments. But his signature freewheeling banter also masks important consistency. He is, actually, predictable.\n\nFor more politics coverage and analysis, sign up for Here\u2019s the Deal, our weekly politics newsletter, here.\n\nThe Republican presidential nominee rarely commits to details or specifics. This is not unique to him as a politician, but Trump has a particularly pronounced form. His personal disregard for long policy briefs and policy intricacies is well known. Trump\u2019s primary approach as a politician is operating by instinct.\n\nThus, the question of what Trump himself proposes is a critical one.\n\nWe analyzed three rally speeches following President Joe Biden\u2019s withdrawal from the 2024 race. He made nearly the same promises at each one, each time a cap to his stump speech.\n\nBelow is a full list of what Trump promised, alongside some context. Of course, this is not a comprehensive list of every promise Trump has made, rather, a focused look at what he is promising right now on the campaign trail.\n\nA quick note: For some items, we have left the reader to interpret for themselves. Those are broad pledges that are straightforward, but not detailed such as, \u201cI will keep you out of wars,\u201d or, \u201cI will prevent World War III.\u201d\n\n1. On Day 1, \u201cwe will begin the largest deportation operation in American history.\u201d\n\nContext: Trump is pledging to deploy a \u201cmassive dragnet\u201d to arrest and deport millions of undocumented migrants. He has told crowds, and Time magazine in April, that he would use local law enforcement to do this as well as, potentially, the National Guard and active duty military. He has not offered more specifics about how any of those mechanisms would work. He has indicated in his speeches that he would first target \u201ccriminals,\u201d mentioning violent crimes like murder and rape.\n\nThis is not a new pledge. Trump promised mass deportations as part of his 2016 campaign.\n\n2. \u201cMy very first day back in the White House, I will terminate every single open border policy of the Biden-Harris administration, and we will seal the border.\u201d\n\nContext: Trump has promised to restore some of his hardline immigration policies that the Biden administration has reversed. He gave a run-down of this in Minnesota, saying, \u201cI will restore the travel ban, suspend refugee admissions, stop the resettlement, and keep the terrorists the hell out of our country.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s initial ban of people arriving from Muslim countries was ruled unconstitutional, but he revised it to focus on potential threats, though it still largely included Muslim countries.\n\nIn addition, Trump would bring back \u201cRemain in Mexico,\u201d which aimed to force asylum seekers to wait in Mexico before they could cross into the United States to claim asylum. That policy has faced legal, human rights and political pushback on both sides of the border.\n\nTrump has also indicated he may try to use Title 42 emergency powers for immigration purposes, especially in returning child migrants to families. And he has left open the idea of again separating migrant families, though a court has ruled that policy cannot restart during the next administration.\n\n3. \u201cWe will drill, baby, drill.\u201d\n\n4. \u201cWe will end inflation and make America affordable again.\u201d\n\nA pledge to end inflation ranks high on the 2024 Republican Party platform, though inflation has been down. And as for the promise to \u201cmake America affordable again\u201d? With Trump offering no specifics, that\u2019s up for interpretation.\n\n5. \u201cI will terminate the Green New Scam,\u201d and end the electric vehicle mandate.\n\nContext: As readers may know, the Green New Deal is a set of progressive-left climate and workplace ideas, most concretely written into legislative proposals by Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. The Green New Deal is not U.S. law, but Trump is using it in speeches to bash an unspecified range of ideas from the \u201cradical left.\u201d\n\nRegarding EVs, Biden put in place a new federal regulation in March that required automakers to increase fuel efficiency of their cars substantially over a number of years. That requirement would force many car companies to convert vehicles to electric or partially electric to meet the standard. Biden\u2019s policy has faced an avalanche of lawsuits already. Some believe it may be legally doomed, regardless of who becomes president, following a recent Supreme Court ruling.\n\n6. \u201cWe will pass massive tax cuts for workers\u201d that include no tax on tips.\n\nContext: This is a complicated area. Trump wants to extend the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act tax cuts that went in place during his administration, but they\u2019re set to expire in 2025. This would affect millions of Americans. Some 80 percent of households saw a tax cut in 2018 because of the TCJA, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. This would not be a new tax cut, but rather a proposal to stop taxes from going up.\n\nTrump does not mention this in his speeches, but Politico has reported that he has told business leaders he would like to lower corporate taxes, which will keep their 2017 tax cuts regardless. Those do not expire.\n\nAt the same time, CNBC has reported that Trump, in a meeting with House Republicans, raised the idea of replacing individual income taxes with an \u201call tariff policy.\u201d That idea has met with sharp pushback from some economists who say it is mathematically impossible and that tariffs generally have a regressive effect \u2014 they hurt working classes the most. (See below for more on tariffs.)\n\nHis tips idea is more straightforward. Trump wants to end taxation on income earned by tips. (This would require congressional action to move forward.) The Washington Post found that more than 6 million workers reported tips to the IRS in 2018. At the same time, this idea could cost some $150 to $250 billion in federal revenue over 10 years, per the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n\n7. \u201cI will revoke China\u2019s most favored nation status.\u201d\n\nContext: China was granted permanent and \u201cmost favored\u201d trade status in 2001 by Republican President George W. Bush, meaning the U.S. generally should offer China trade terms that are as good as any other trading partner with the U.S.\n\n8. \u201cI will pass the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act, that means that if China or any other country makes us pay a 100 or 200 percent tariff or tax, we will make them pay a reciprocal tariff or tax of 100 or 200 percent immediately, right back.\u201d\n\nContext: Trump explains this concept succinctly here. He would lean into any tariff war, retaliating \u201ceye-for-an-eye\u201d for a tariff imposed by other countries. Trump argues that this will protect American jobs, especially in manufacturing and other competitive industries. But others, including the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute, say it would end up being an economic mistake, raising prices for American consumers across the board and harming workers the most.\n\n9. Shortly after regaining the Oval Office, \u201cI will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled \u2026 quickly.\u201d\n\n10. \u201cI will prevent World War III.\u201d\n\n11. \u201cI will restore peace through strength.\u201d\n\nContext: World War III has been mentioned a ton in Trump speeches. In drawing a contrast between Biden and himself in their first presidential debate, Trump warned viewers that the president would draw the country further into global conflict. Now facing off against Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump has continued to invoke the specter of a third World War.\n\nHere\u2019s how he put it in his speech in Charlotte, North Carolina: \u201cI will prevent World War III. We\u2019re heading to World War III, we\u2019re heading right into the teeth of it \u2026 I will restore peace through strength.\u201d\n\n12. \u201cIn my next term, we will build a great Iron Dome missile defense shield over our country, a dome the likes of which no one has ever seen before, and it will be entirely made in the USA.\u201d\n\nNote: In Minnesota, Trump said \u201cit will be entirely made in Minnesota \u2026 Minnesota has got a big piece of it.\n\nContext: Trump is referencing Israel\u2019s project Iron Dome, a series of missile defense capabilities that aim to destroy short-range weapons launched against the country. It is not clear what threats Trump aims the dome to address, with some experts pointing out that the contiguous U.S. is surrounded by allied countries and oceans. Intelligence officials said China was responsible for a spy balloon that sailed over the country in 2023 before it was shot down by current military capabilities.\n\nMinnesota is the nation\u2019s leading producer of iron ore.\n\n13. \u201cI will not cut one penny from Social Security or Medicare, and I will not raise the retirement age.\u201d\n\nContext: Social Security\u2019s trust funds will be depleted by 2035, according to this year\u2019s trustees report. At that point, without any action by lawmakers in Washington, payments to seniors will be cut by 27 percent. Medicare\u2019s hospital trust fund would go broke in 2036 under the current policy.\n\nThere are a few ways to provide solvency, but increasingly all involve some pain \u2014 increasing retirement age, cutting benefits or increasing what some or all Americans must contribute.\n\nTrump\u2019s promise misses the important context that without any action, there will be cuts to these benefits.\n\n14. \u201cI am going to keep you out of wars.\u201d\n\n15. \u201cWe have people at the top [of the military] that are woke, and they\u2019re all gone. We are going to get rid of them so fast.\u201d\n\nContext: Trump said this in St. Cloud, Minnesota, only. Trump asserted that most military generals are not \u201cwoke,\u201d but that some are. Trump is pledging to get rid of those who are \u201cwoke.\u201d\n\n16. \u201cWe are going to rebuild our cities into beacons of hope, safety and beauty better than they\u2019ve ever been before.\u201d\n\nContext: Trump says he would work with Democratic mayors and governors to achieve this, but has not provided details.\n\nTrump regularly raises concerns about crime in America, especially in cities. Politifact checked these statements and found Trump\u2019s words about rising crime rates to be \u201cmostly false,\u201d because violent crime rates have fallen for most of the country. Property crime has risen, including car thefts.\n\nIn addition, the conservative American Enterprise Institute has written about data showing that urban Americans are slightly more likely to say they\u2019re \u201cpretty happy\u201d with their lives than rural Americans.\n\n17. \u201cWe will take over the horribly run capital of our nation \u2026 and clean it up, renovate it, rebuild it.\u201d\n\nContext: Trump\u2019s vision for the nation\u2019s capital is to require traditional and neoclassical architecture, based on Renaissance ideas of Greco-Roman aesthetics. As he was exiting his presidency in late 2020, he issued an executive order declaring that the federal government has \u201clargely stopped building beautiful buildings\u201d and that in D.C., \u201cclassical architecture shall be the preferred and default architecture for Federal public buildings.\u201d\n\nIn these rally speeches, Trump has also said of D.C. that \u201cwe are going to take over the management, the leadership of it.\u201d Residents of the nation\u2019s capital do not have a vote in Congress, but for 50 years Congress has allowed them \u201chome rule,\u201d so that their city council can generally oversee how the city operates. Congress and the White House retain a kind of veto power. Trump allies and pushing to end D.C. home rule. This may be what he is implying here.\n\n18. I will sign an executive order that cuts federal funding \u201cfor any school pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity and other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content onto the shoulders of our children.\u201d\n\nContext: There is a lot to unpack here. But Trump has largely not defined precisely which policies he would attempt to penalize. At the same time, there is a legal battle over interpretations of Biden administration rules that declare Title IX protections based on sex include safeguards for LGBTQ+ youth. Trump\u2019s policies would need to follow federal court guidance, once established.\n\n19. I will defund any school that has a vaccine or mask mandate.\n\nContext: See this helpful segment from White House correspondent Laura Barr\u00f3n-L\u00f3pez. In short, medical experts say the implications of eliminating vaccine mandates would be enormous for schools and for public health.\n\n20. \u201cI will keep men out of women\u2019s sports.\u201d\n\nContext: Trump is proposing a ban on transgender women from participating in women\u2019s sports. When he speaks about this, he largely refers to youth sports. See above, regarding trans youth.\n\n21. \u201cI will fully uphold our Second Amendment.\u201d\n\nContext: Trump has indicated that he would oppose most, if not all, new restrictions on gun usage and ownership.\n\n22. \u201cWe will protect innocent life.\u201d\n\nContext: On abortion, Trump supports the current status quo, that is to say that states have the right to restrict or nearly ban abortion as they choose. This stance on abortion has put him at odds with some of his base voters who would like a national ban. But Trump has indicated he would not support that.\n\nA side note: Trump does not usually use the word \u201cabortion\u201d in his speeches. Instead he nods to the issue, as well as others, by using this broad phrasing.\n\n23. \u201cWe will restore, very quickly, free speech.\u201d\n\nContext: This short phrase leads to an extensive plan for \u201cfree speech\u201d reform that Trump announced in 2022. He would use presidential power to limit what rules federal agencies, universities and tech companies could employ to address speech, including controversial ideas.\n\nTrump, alongside other right-wing figures and his supporters, have made continuous claims that a combination of news media, social media platforms and a \u201cdeep state\u201d arm of the government have sought to suppress their speech.\n\nTrump has been a major purveyor of \u201cthe Big Lie\u201d \u2014 that the 2020 election was \u201cstolen\u201d and he was the real winner. Biden won the election. Despite Trump\u2019s insistence that he was the actual victor, courts on the state and federal level confirmed the outcome of the election in Biden\u2019s favor. In fact, Biden broke the record for the most total votes cast for a U.S. presidential candidate, a record previously set by Barack Obama in 2008.\n\n24. \u201cI will secure our elections.\u201d\n\nContext: This promise echoes the official Republican party platform of securing elections by calling for same-day voting, paper ballots, proof of citizenship and voter identification. At the same time, Republican leaders have urged voters to use all available options for casting their ballots, like absentee or mail-in voting. Trump has falsely claimed that voting by mail or using drop boxes is less secure and, thus, more open to mass voter fraud. (It\u2019s not.)\n\nTrump, since losing the 2020 election to Biden, has repeatedly cast doubt on the outcome and integrity of the last presidential contest. Trump delivered combative remarks and baseless claims of voter fraud to supporters, including moments before the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\nPart of his reelection message to his base has been to \u201cguard the vote.\u201d This has raised alarm bells over safeguarding democracy and elections and escalated concerns about voter intimidation and election workers during November\u2019s election.",

        "text": "Get ready to vote in 2024 presidential election\nFor most students on the University of South Carolina campus this fall, 2024 is your first chance to vote in a presidential election. To help with this exciting milestone, here are some resources that can help you get registered on time (if you\u2019re not already registered) and make sure your vote is counted even if you are many states away from home.\n\nAs a student, you have a right to register to vote where you live, whether that is your family\u2019s home or where you attend school. You should update your registration when your address changes. And remember, you may be registered and vote in only one location.\n\nUSC partners with TurboVote, which is a platform that gives you an easy-to-use space to register to vote, check your registration and connect with additional voting resources and information. TurboVote is free for students to use and can be your one-stop shop to prepare for the election.\n\nUSC has also partnered with our home county to provide early voting at the Blatt P.E. Center from Oct. 21 to Nov. 1 for students, faculty and staff who are registered to vote in Richland County, South Carolina.\n\nCheck out the Leadership and Service Center civic engagement webpage for more resources on the rules of where you can vote and what documents you need to get registered. You can also learn about events, such as the Dialogue Series, which can help you navigate difficult conversations and turn them into valuable learning experiences. The first Dialogue Series event will be Sept. 17, which is also National Voter Registration Day.\n\nThe Southeastern Conference student governments are partnering to challenge 20,000 students across the SEC to register to vote. The initiative will kick off in September and is being led by USC Student Government President Patton Byars.\n\nIt's never too early to make your voting plan. Use Vote411\u2019s voting plan to help you prepare.\n\nRemember: There are no classes on Election Day (Nov. 5) so there are no excuses for not voting.\n\nVoter checklist:\n\nRegister or verify a valid prior registration.\n\nLearn your voting options and locations.\n\nResearch candidates.\n\nPlan transportation.\n\nVote!\n\nThe registration deadline was exteded to Oct. 14 (because of Hurricane Helene) for all eligible South Carolina residents whether you choose to register in person, online, or by mail.\n\n\n\nIf you are planning to vote in another state, you may need to prepare further in advance. Each state has different election laws and deadlines. For more information about your state\u2019s voting laws and procedures, go to Vote411 and select your state.\n\nKeep up with absentee ballot deadlines by entering your address on TurboVote.\n\nMore resources",

According to the latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll , the presumptive Democrat candidate has built a 51%-48% lead over the former president. It is 4 points better than what was found in the poll held immediately after US President Joe Biden stepped aside and endorsed the vice president two weeks ago.NPR has reported that Kamala Harris got this increased support because Black voters, white women with college degrees and women who identify as political independents have supported her. The Democrat contender has received 20 to 30 points more than the time when she first entered the race. She has improved her lead in the suburbs and with white voters overall.Kamala Harris is in a better condition also because there is no anti-incumbency factor against her and she is not being held responsible for economic woes, unlike Biden. Donald Trump is doing better on the issue of economy as but only by 3 points over Harris (51%-48%), compared to 9 points over the incumbent president (54%-45%) in June. Similarly, the Republican candidate is doing better on the issue of handling immigration by 6 points (52%-46%). However, on the issue of abortion, the vice president has an advantage of 15%.The NPR/PBS News/Marist poll was held from Thursday to Sunday before Harris picked Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate. The surveyors interviewed 1,613 adults via cellphone, landline and online research panels in English and Spanish.The CBS/YouGov poll showed Kamala Harris up by the barest of margins, but doing dramatically better than Joe Biden had been before he decided to step aside and endorse the vice president.According to the recently held NPR/PBS News/Marist poll , 56% of the US citizens think Kamala Harris, not Donald Trump (41%), would better handle the abortion issue.According to an NPR/PBS News/Marist poll, Donald Trump is doing better on the issue of economy as but only by 3 points over Harris (51%-48%), compared to 9 points over the incumbent president (54%-45%) in June.",

This isn't a Democrat or Republican issue, it's an American and Virginian issue. Every legal vote deserves to be counted without being watered down by illegal votes or inaccurate machines. In Virginia, we don\u2019t play games and our model for election security is working,\u201d said Governor Glenn Youngkin.\n\n\u201cWe use 100% paper ballots with a strict chain of custody. We use counting machines, not voting machines, that are tested prior to every election and never connected to the internet. We do not mass mail ballots. We monitor our drop boxes 24/7. We verify the legal presence and identity of voters using DMV data and other trusted data sources to update our voter rolls daily, not only adding new voters, but scrubbing the lists to remove those that should not be on it, like the deceased, individuals that have moved, and non-citizens that have accidentally or maliciously attempted to register,\u201d Governor Glenn Youngkin continued.\n\nThe EO codifies improvements to election security made during the Governor\u2019s administration by directing the Commissioner of the Department of Elections to certify in writing annually that these improvements are in place. The EO also outlines the procedures in place for non-citizens who attempt to violate the law and register to vote, which includes referral to the local Commonwealth\u2019s attorney and the Office of Attorney General, which has concurrent jurisdiction.\n\n# # #",

BU Experts Talk about Why\u2014and the Way Forward\n\nPhoto by Douglas Rissing/iStock Politics Is Our Democracy at Risk? Americans think so. Faculty experts say electoral reforms, compromise, and a bit of moral outrage might be in order.\n\nWith the 2024 presidential election booming, one phrase stands out as a harbinger of uncertain times: democracy at risk. It\u2019s been covered in news, invoked by liberal and conservative pundits and presidential candidates, and fretted over in private.\n\nSurveys show Americans are concerned about the state of democracy. In March 2024, the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service announced its latest bipartisan Battleground Civility Poll: 81 percent of respondents said they believe democracy in America is being threatened. Three months before, an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found 62 percent of adults believe democracy in the US \u201ccould be at risk,\u201d depending on which presidential candidate wins this fall. \u201cThe poll asked about the importance of the coming presidential election for 12 issues and found that the percentage who said the outcome will be very or extremely important to the future of democracy in the U.S. (67%) ranked behind only the economy (75%),\u201d the AP said in December 2023.\n\nIn general, those who see our form of government in decline point to issues like immigration, voter suppression, compromised election integrity, entrenched bipartisanship, rising authoritarian sentiment, and fears about media manipulation.\n\nBruce Schulman, William E. Huntington Professor of History at the College of Arts & Sciences, puts our present-day grasp of democracy in a historical context. \u201cThe [founding fathers] thought of themselves as having created a democratic system, but we have to understand that even our most fundamental ideas of what a democracy entails have changed over time,\u201d he says, noting that two centuries ago, only one-tenth of the population\u2014all white, male landowners\u2014was able to vote.\n\nSince then, our collective notion of the boundaries of democracy have expanded and contracted in different contexts. During and after both World Wars, Schulman says, American citizens saw an increase in \u201ccensorship, crackdown on dissent, extraordinary powers taken by the government, and the rise of vigilantism\u2014such as attacks on immigrants or persecution of alleged communists.\n\n\u201cDemocratic systems rest on a set of laws and practices\u2014but also on a set of norms and cultural assumptions\u2014that are vulnerable to attack,\u201d which can often manifest \u201cas a hostility to the values of openness, tolerance, inclusion, diversity, and respect for opposing viewpoints.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, he says, as we move toward a historic rematch between two controversial presidential candidates, we\u2019re also moving into uncharted waters.\n\n\u201cIn our current cycle, every Republican politician is asked if they will accept the results of the election,\u201d Schulman says, \u201cand the fact that this is a question is just plain weird.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn our current cycle, every Republican politician is asked if they will accept the results of the election, and the fact that this is a question is just plain weird.\u201d Bruce Schulman, William E. Huntington Professor of History at the College of Arts & Sciences\n\nHow did we get here? Who is responsible for eroding the public\u2019s trust, and how can we get it back? Bostonia spoke with BU faculty members about some of the issues that may be putting our system of government at risk.\n\nDeepfakes and Denialism\n\nIn a recent analysis in the Washington Post, three political scientists wrote about their research on the impact of fake news: \u201cThe prospect of sharing false information\u2014spread by individuals and foreign governments\u2014threatens the quality of democracy in America. False and noisy information makes voters more likely to reelect poorly performing governments and lowers public confidence in democracy.\u201d\n\nJoan Donovan, a College of Communication assistant professor, studies misinformation and disinformation in a media environment\u2014the internet and social media\u2014where \u201calternative facts\u201d and outright falsehoods have reached crisis levels. She believes that citizens have \u201ca human right to the truth.\u201d\n\nTraditional media has its safeguards in the form of fact-checking and gatekeeping, but internet platforms and social media demolish all barriers, Donovan says. Without a stringent regard for factual information, the new media landscape has become rife with conspiracy theories, deepfakes, science denialism, and propaganda, often masquerading as genuine information. A TikTok video circulated in January, for example, featured audio that was AI-generated to sound like President Joe Biden calling for F-15 fighter jets to be sent to the Texas-Mexico border. The audio was deemed a deepfake by the Poynter Institute for Media Studies and other experts.\n\nJoan Donovan, College of Communication assistant professor of journalism and emerging media studies\n\n\u201cAnything that is novel and outrageous is going to circulate further and faster across social media than anything that is fact-based,\u201d Donovan says, \u201cand we don\u2019t have companies at the helm of the information ecosystem that are willing to address these issues head-on.\u201d\n\nSearch engine algorithms share the blame, she adds. Algorithms like Google\u2019s prioritize information that\u2019s \u201cfresh and relevant\u201d or trending over information that\u2019s been factually verified. And often, this trending information has an agenda attached to it.\n\n\u201cNot a lot of people are going to wake up every day and remind the internet that the Holocaust happened, but there are a large number of people that are willing to wake up every day and deny the Holocaust,\u201d Donovan says. \u201cIf you search for \u2018Did the Holocaust happen?\u2019 it shouldn\u2019t be the case that there are two or three new results every other day.\u201d\n\nThe people who generate disinformation \u201chave an outsize influence on our culture, on our society, on our politics,\u201d she says. \u201cIf they were to call for an insurrection or some kind of coup, they may be able to organize a large enough militia to do so. I know that sounds crazy to think about, but it\u2019s one of the consequences of having technology organized in this way\u2014the people with the largest network are going to exercise more power, potentially more power than politicians.\u201d\n\nIf challenges to factual information are a threat to democracy, as some say, aren\u2019t challenges to free speech, even conspiratorial speech, of equal concern? Perhaps, but Donovan is adamant that regulating the internet is not the same thing as curtailing free speech.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have more or less free speech because the internet exists\u2014you have the capacity to broadcast it, which is different,\u201d she says. \u201cBut the free speech question becomes the major argumentative point that prevents any policy from coming forward.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t have more or less free speech because the internet exists\u2014you have the capacity to broadcast it, which is different.\n\nWhat might that policy look like? Donovan calls for an effort to keep a record of all posts made by elected officials\u2014a project she is engaged in at BU\u2014which would hold them to account if they were to promulgate antidemocratic ideas. In terms of broader ideological reforms, she\u2019d like to see the internet function more like a public utility, such as a library, and less like a corporate platform.\n\n\u201cWe need to have processes of peer review in order to see more stability in what gets returned when you search for something,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s been capture of communication, and downstream of that is a society that\u2019s much more vulnerable to authoritarianism.\u201d\n\nPolitical Violence\n\nWhen Steve Rosenzweig watched the news on January 6, 2021, he was shocked. But he also knew that years of extremist rhetoric on social media was bound to boil over into violent action.\n\n\u201cIn hindsight, the writing was on the wall,\u201d says Rosenzweig, a College of Arts & Sciences assistant professor of political science. \u201cI actually wrote an opinion piece in the Boston Globe a couple of months before that, warning that\u2026violence was on the table.\u201d\n\nThe Globe piece was eerily prescient: \u201cBarring an indisputable landslide on election night, Trump appears likely to contest the results. He will claim rampant voter fraud. He will demand that the courts and the Justice Department intercede on his behalf. And he will wink and nod at the armed extremists currently occupying the fringe of his base.\u201d\n\nSteve Rosenzweig, College of Arts & Sciences assistant professor of political science\n\nMany will remember that day as an unprecedented show of political violence by a group propelled by the belief\u2014without evidence\u2014that the 2020 presidential election results were illegitimate. Rosenzweig, a scholar of political violence in East African countries, is acutely aware that the US has a history of using brute force to achieve political ends.\n\nThe American violence of the 19th and 20th centuries was explicitly racially motivated. Rosenzweig cites the 1965 march on Selma, Ala., where Martin Luther King, Jr. (GRS\u201955, Hon.\u201959) and supporters of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 were met with violent opposition, as a prime example.\n\n\u201cThe amount of time in which we have a fully democratic system for all people in the US has only really been since the Voting Rights Act at the earliest,\u201d Rosenzweig says. \u201cWe sometimes forget that the periods in which we\u2019ve had full multiracial democracy and relatively low levels of political violence are almost an anomaly.\u201d\n\nThere are plenty of examples of reversing democratic erosion or backsliding, Rosenzweig says: \u201cIn Senegal, there have been presidents who have tried to extend their time in office and were forced to backtrack, and you saw peaceful transitions as a result.\n\n\u201cBut violence, once it\u2019s out of the box, is a little more difficult to put back in.\u201d\n\nThe key to keeping a society free of political violence, he says: \u201cEvery political system has those who might utilize violence in pursuit of their goals. What determines whether violence becomes common or not is the extent to which mainstream politicians endorse it.\u201d\n\nVoter Suppression\n\nIn the last few decades, many states have mounted barriers to the ballot box\u2014imposing strict voter ID laws, decreased voting times, and restricted registration. Such measures have deleterious outcomes, with \u201cracial minorities, poor people, and young and old voters\u201d as the primary targets, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law.\n\nChristine Slaughter, a College of Arts & Sciences assistant professor of political science, researches the voter landscape, probing the psychological reasons certain demographic groups, like Black individuals, do and do not turn out to vote and which candidates they choose.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a prominent theory of Black political behavior\u2026that demonstrates that Black people believe what happens to the group will have something to do with what happens in their lives,\u201d she says. \u201cNot too many other racial groups have that sense of solidarity that shapes their politics, and looking across the political landscape, we can see that linked fate is a unique attribute for Black voters.\u201d\n\nChristine Slaughter, College of Arts & Sciences assistant professor of political science\n\nSlaughter\u2019s research finds that Black voters, and Black women in particular, are impelled by a sense of political optimism that sees them well-represented at the ballot box. This optimism was manifested in a decisive turnout during the 2020 presidential election, and some political scientists credit that turnout to Biden\u2019s victory. It was also a year marked by significant attempts to compromise voting integrity, which could likely reemerge in November 2024, Slaughter says.\n\n\u201cIn many states, African American voters experience disenfranchisement and vote dilution, which weakens their ability to make an electoral impact,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the Democrats have not done much to stand against fraud allegations [made by Republicans], or move quickly to pass a new Voting Rights Act prior to this election, or ensure equal representation.\u201d\n\nIn many states, African American voters experience disenfranchisement and vote dilution, which weakens their ability to make an electoral impact.\n\nReforms to address voter suppression (which frequently targets Black individuals and other voters of color) are steps in the right direction, Slaughter says. \u201cBut despite their effectiveness, not all states adopt these reforms,\u201d leaving voters especially vulnerable in states with restrictive voting laws.\n\nShe also notes that while electoral reforms to improve voter access and convenience\u2014like online and same-day registration and the elimination of barriers like required photo identification\u2014can be effective in certain areas, \u201cno one reform has a uniform effect across states.\u201d Politics, she adds, always factor into how, where, and when people vote.\n\n\u201cTherefore, several approaches exist to improving voter confidence, and each has some benefits but also some drawbacks,\u201d she says. \u201cUnfortunately, it takes elected officials coming across the aisle in order to implement them [effectively], and in such a polarizing time, that is unlikely to happen.\u201d\n\nExtreme Populism\n\nVivien Schmidt, Jean Monnet Professor of European Integration and a professor emerita of international relations and political science at the Frederick S. Pardee School of Global Studies, is a scholar of European populism, an ideology she says is characterized by its \u201cus versus them\u201d message, its charismatic messenger, and its ability to create messages that resonate with citizens\u2019 economic, social, and political discontent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s anti-elite, antiestablishment, and it tends to be angry,\u201d she says. \u201cThe discourse can be seen as anti-liberal democracy, because it\u2019s against any kind of intermediary institutions.\u201d\n\nPopulism is also often spoken of in the same breath as nationalism, particularly when examining extreme conservative movements, she says. \u201cOn the right, national sovereignty has become a major issue, because it\u2019s about identity\u2014it\u2019s about an ideal of identity from the past,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the US in particular, it links to white supremacy.\u201d\n\nFar-right populist messaging in Europe and in the US tend to mirror each other, but Schmidt warns of some key differences in scope. For one thing, the European Union continues to act as a checks-and-balances system that prevents antidemocratic movements from taking over the continent.\n\nSo, why is right-wing populism so threatening, and why is it happening now?\n\n\u201cIn the US, extreme right populism moves toward authoritarianism,\u201d Schmidt explains. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more policymakers and ordinary voters saying they want a strong leader.\u201d\n\nIn the US, extreme right populism moves toward authoritarianism. Vivien Schmidt, Jean Monnet Professor of European Integration and professor emerita of international relations and political science at the Frederick S. Pardee School of Global Studies\n\nThe movement incubated in the financial crisis of the 2000s and the collapse of American manufacturing, where average Americans went from \u201cgood manufacturing jobs to not-good service jobs to the platform economy,\u201d she says. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t people be angry, and why wouldn\u2019t they worry about being left behind? They look at the politicians to say, \u2018You haven\u2019t solved my problem.\u2019\u201d\n\nSchmidt says that regrettably, only in a liberal democracy can citizens campaign for, and ultimately achieve, an autocratic state: \u201cWinston Churchill said that democracy is the worst form of government except for all the other ones. There\u2019s nothing inherent in democracy to save it from the authoritarian drift. In order to make it work, you need consensus, you need compromise, and you need people to talk to one another.\u201d\n\nCitizen Mobilization\n\nIt may seem paradoxical, but according to Schulman, now is not the time to double down on the old ways.\n\n\u201cThe idea that a constitution would survive for 200 years would never have occurred to the framers,\u201d he says. Democracy must be allowed to evolve. In the beginning of the 20th century, for instance, major progressive reforms, like women\u2019s voting rights, were passed through on-the-ground campaigning, which led to constitutional amendments, he says.\n\n\u201cIn the last 60 years, the Constitution has not been amended in any substantial way,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople have to agree to say, \u2018Hey, this isn\u2019t working,\u2019 in order to fix things.\u201d\n\nRobert L. Tsai, School of Law professor of law and Harry Elwood Warren Memorial Scholar\n\nRobert L. Tsai, a School of Law professor of law, Harry Elwood Warren Memorial Scholar, and an expert in constitutional policy, says it\u2019s the power of moral outrage that gets representatives to start listening, changes laws, creates amendments, and determines the success or failure of an initiative.\n\n\u201cYou need outrage, particularly in our modern age, when so many things make us feel fairly indifferent to the suffering of others,\u201d he says. \u201cI have faith that if you\u2019re willing to embrace a certain amount of messiness, people will eventually come together.\u201d\n\nBut Tsai believes that citizen campaigns should not necessarily be focused on getting amendments passed or achieving favorable Supreme Court rulings. Instead, that energy should be trained on local and state courts.\n\n\u201cI can cite you any number of laws that the Supreme Court basically killed in the cradle decades ago, where lawyers got totally repudiated,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd those cases get cited now as terrible law. On the other hand, if you look at the states that passed the Equal Rights Amendment [in the 1970s], it was done through citizen mobilization.\u201d\n\nThis is not mere theory, Tsai notes. The ideals that are the bedrock of our democracy have come to fruition as the result of citizen efforts in the smaller courts. \u201cMost of us who are living in America believe in democracy\u2014one person, one vote. But most people don\u2019t realize that that principle is not actually written anywhere in the Constitution,\u201d he says. \u201cThe only reason the Supreme Court ever even uttered those words is because of the mobilization that went on for generations at the local level, to make state elections more democratic, and more open.\u201d",

        "text": "Latter-day Saints, Democrats and Republicans, join forces to support Harris \u2022 Idaho Capital Sun\nA group of Kamala Harris supporters convened in a virtual call Tuesday evening. It was an eclectic mix with attorneys, lawmakers, podcasters, singers and a mayor. There were, certainly, Democrats on the speaker lists, but also Republicans who have decided to step away from their party\u2019s ticket this year.\n\nWhat connected all of them? Their Latter-day Saint faith.\n\nMembers of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints may be a substantial force in presidential outcomes in deeply red Utah and battleground Arizona, according to speakers, including Mayor of Mesa, Arizona, John Giles, who is Republican, but is a vocal Harris supporter; former Democratic U.S. representative from Utah Ben McAdams; and Salt Lake City Democratic legislators Sen. Luz Escamilla and Rep. Brian King, the latter also being the Democratic gubernatorial nominee in Utah.\n\nData shows that Latter-day Saints are poised to support Harris \u201cmore than any other presidential Democratic ticket in 60 years,\u201d said Jacob Rugh, an associate professor in the Department of Sociology at church-run Brigham Young University, during the call. He cited his research and past races that have moved the needle left in Utah and Maricopa County in Arizona.\n\n\u201cMy geospatial analysis shows that areas heavy with LDS chapels in the east valley were most likely to flip blue (in 2020),\u201d Rugh said on Tuesday. Nationwide, in 2020, 1 in 3 Latter-day Saint voters picked the Biden-Harris ticket, and the majority of the faith\u2019s millennial and Gen Z voters chose the Democratic ticket, according to Rugh.\n\nLDS membership in the West\n\nThe 2020 Biden-Harris ticket performance in Utah \u201cwas the best of any Democratic ticket since 1964. Salt Lake County flipped blue in 2016 and, in 2020, voters did what others said was impossible by flipping four precincts blue in Provo,\u201d Rugh said. He predicts they \u201cwill flip even more in 2024.\u201d\n\nThere are 2.1 million members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Utah, according to data from the church. It\u2019s the most prominent faith in Utah, which has historically voted red. There are also more than 442,800 members in Arizona and more than 476,000 members in Idaho.\n\nAbout 1,400 people tuned into Tuesday\u2019s call, a first from a group called Latter-day Saints for Harris-Walz, which on its social media boasted of as many as 2,600 registrants. The event came the same day Harris announced she had picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate.\n\nThe remarks from presenters, mostly from Utah and Arizona, were preceded by a prayer. Speakers also cited scripture as they spoke about the character of the Republican presidential nominee, former President Donald Trump, and to explain why, in their view, the most Latter-day Saint-aligned candidate is Harris.\n\nMostly, it was a discussion on how to organize to elect Harris. After all, Rob Taber, an organizer, said Latter-day Saints \u201cfrom missions and ministering, (are) pretty good at reaching out to people and building bridges.\u201d\n\nHowever, Taber also advised those on the call not to use ward or stake membership lists when reaching out to people because that violates the church\u2019s neutrality policy.\n\n\u201cBut you can share on social media how you\u2019re feeling. This actually does make a big difference,\u201d Taber said.\n\nLDS Church encourages members to \u2018examine the character\u2019 of candidates\n\nAsk Mesa Mayor John Giles why he decided to support a Democratic candidate and he may cite the arguments he made in an op-ed he wrote in Arizona Central criticizing Trump\u2019s refusal to accept the outcome of the 2020 election and his disinvestment in cities like Mesa, and where he called on other Arizona Republicans to choose \u201ccountry over party this election.\u201d\n\nBut, he may also mention an admonition he heard at a Latter-day Saint church meeting that encouraged members to be good citizens, to participate in elections and to \u201cexamine the character of the candidates.\u201d\n\n\u201cMan, I sincerely hope that we get that admonition this election season, because I think that would help our brothers and sisters to look with fresh eyes at this election,\u201d Giles said on Tuesday.\n\nGiles also cited the church\u2019s stance on defending the U.S. Constitution and how different that perspective is from Trump\u2019s view, he said.\n\nTrump is \u201cmore than willing to compromise the rule of law and the United States Constitution to further his own gains,\u201d Giles said. \u201cI think that we have a particular mission as Latter-day Saints to step up and point those things out to our friends inside the church and outside as well.\u201d\n\nSome of the attendees, such as McAdams, said they vote Democrat \u201cnot in spite of our religion, but because of our religion,\u201d arguing that \u201cnegativity, divisiveness, rage, political violence, discrimination and racism are not of God.\u201d\n\nUtah Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla said that, as she was preparing to teach Sunday School, it was clear to her that Trump may not be aligned with Latter-day Saint doctrine. She quoted Elder Dallin H. Oaks, first counselor in the church\u2019s First Presidency.\n\n\u201cHe said \u2018knowing that we are all children of God, give us a divine vision of the worth of all others and the will and ability to rise above prejudice and racism.\u2019 The current candidate for the Republican Party is literally working tirelessly to create prejudice and racism against Americans,\u201d Escamilla said. \u201cAnd that alone is a reason why all members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints should be supporting Vice President Harris for President of the United States in the 2024 election cycle.\u201d\n\nUtah gubernatorial candidate Rep. Brian King also praised Harris\u2019 running mate, arguing that Walz fits into the model he likes to see in the country\u2019s candidates and elected officials.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the kind of candidate that leaders of our faith have called for us to support, a person of integrity, compassion, with a commitment to service,\u201d King said. \u201cI\u2019m so glad that Vice President Harris has revealed her own personality so clearly in her choice of running mate.\u201d\n\nUtah News Dispatch, like the Idaho Capital Sun, is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

        "text": "The Legion's policy during election cycles\nAs the 2024 presidential election nears, it is imperative for American Legion members and posts to remember that The American Legion is a nonpolitical, nonpartisan organization that will not be used for the dissemination of partisan principles nor for the promotion of any candidate or party. This includes the wearing of American Legion and Sons of The American Legion apparel when engaged in partisan activities.\n\nAs Legionnaires will cast their ballots on Election Day, The American Legion advocates for all U.S. citizens to register and vote in all elections through its \u201cGet Out the Vote\u201d program. Download the \u201cVote, America\u201d brochure to see how your post can encourage more Americans to vote.\n\nLegion posts, Legionnaires and SAL members should follow these dos and don\u2019ts during an election cycle:\n\n1. Can I wear my American Legion cap to a political event or when promoting my political views in media? No. The American Legion cap is considered the official Legion uniform (see p. 3 of the 2024 Officer's Guide). If attending a political event, The American Legion cap, or any clothing with The American Legion emblem visible, must be removed so as not to imply any endorsement by The American Legion.\n\n2. Can we use our American Legion post for a political event? When using post facilities to host any candidates, the post must remove American Legion emblems and American Legion flags to avoid any impression of endorsements. Candidates for all parties must be presented equal opportunity to use the facilities on the same terms and conditions as other competing candidates.\n\n3. Can I get The American Legion at the local, state and national level to support a candidate running for Congress or any political office? No. In Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution of The American Legion, \"The American Legion shall be absolutely nonpolitical and shall not be used for the dissemination of partisan principles nor for the promotion of the candidacy of any person seeking public office or preferment.\" Additionally, the National Charter, approved by Congress, stipulates The American Legion as an organization is nonpolitical. Therefore, The American Legion as an organization is never to help or endorse a candidate. However, you, as a private citizen and not speaking for the organization, can do whatever is legal and ethical to advance his/her candidacy.\n\n4. Can our post host a registration or voting drive to support \u201cGet Out the Vote\u201d? Yes. Just remember that volunteers working on an American Legion-sponsored registration and voting drive should not wear campaign buttons or make their personal views about candidates, parties and issues known in any way while they are engaged in nonpartisan activities for their post. Any campaign materials or literature should be removed from areas where nonpartisan activities are taking place.",

Sign up for The World This Week.\n\nIntroduction\n\nImmigration has been a touchstone of the U.S. political debate for decades, as policymakers have weighed economic, security, and humanitarian concerns. However, Congress has continued to disagree on comprehensive immigration reform, effectively moving some major policy decisions into the executive and judicial branches of government and fueling debate in the halls of state and municipal governments.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has put efforts to reshape asylum, border, and deportation policy at the center of his political movement. President Joe Biden had pledged to reverse Trump\u2019s first-term actions and reform the system, but the end of pandemic-related border restrictions and a historic surge in migration have complicated his plans.\n\nWhat is the immigrant population in the United States?\n\nImmigrants composed an estimated 13.9 percent of the U.S. population in 2022, amounting to roughly 46 million people out of a total of almost 335 million, according to U.S. Census Bureau data released in April 2024. Together, immigrants and their U.S.-born children made up about 27 percent of U.S. inhabitants, per the Current Population Survey. Though the share of the population that is foreign born has steadily risen since 1970, when there were fewer than ten million immigrants in the country, recent figures still fall below the record high of 14.8 percent in 1890.\n\nAs of 2022, Mexico was the top country of origin for U.S. immigrants, with Mexicans constituting 23 percent of the total immigrant population. Other major countries of origin include India (6 percent); China, including Hong Kong and Macau (5 percent); and the Philippines (4 percent).\n\nUndocumented immigration. The U.S. government estimated the undocumented population to be some eleven million people in 2022. This total represents a slight decrease from 11.8 million before the 2008 economic crisis [PDF], which led some immigrants to return to their home countries and discouraged others from coming to the United States. In fiscal year 2023 (FY 2023), Customs and Border Protection (CBP) apprehended nearly 2.5 million people trying to illegally cross the southern U.S. border, a record high.\n\nUntil 2013, almost all of those trying to cross the U.S.-Mexico border were Mexican citizens, and most were individuals seeking work. Between 2013 and 2021, most immigrants came from Asia, particularly China and India. Mexico has since regained its status as the top country of origin, and Central Americans have made up an increasingly larger share of migrants at the southern U.S. border. Generally, they are coming not for work but to make asylum claims, and many of them are unaccompanied children. Some of these immigrants have different legal rights from Mexican nationals in the United States: Under a 2008 anti\u2013human trafficking law, unaccompanied minors from noncontiguous countries have a right to a hearing before being deported to their home countries. The increase in Central American migration has strained the U.S. immigration system. At the end of FY 2023, there were nearly 2.8 million cases pending in immigration courts, the most on record.\n\nThough many of the policies that aim to reduce unlawful immigration focus on enforcement at the border, individuals who arrive in the United States legally and overstay their visas comprise a significant portion of the undocumented population. A Center for Migration Studies report found that, between 2010 and 2018, individuals who overstayed their visas far outnumbered those who arrived by crossing the border illegally.\n\nLegal immigration. The United States granted more than one million individuals [PDF] legal permanent residency in FY 2022, close to pre-pandemic levels. Some 58 percent of them were admitted on the basis of family reunification. Other categories included: employment-based preferences (27 percent), refugees (3 percent), diversity (4 percent), and asylees (5 percent). As of late 2023, more than four million applicants were on the State Department\u2019s waiting list [PDF] for family- and employer-related immigrant visas, nearly a third of whom were from Mexico.\n\nHundreds of thousands of foreign nationals work legally in the United States under various types of nonimmigrant visas. In FY 2023, the United States granted more than 265,000 visas for high-skilled workers [PDF], known as H1B visas, and over 310,000 visas for temporary workers in agriculture and other industries, or H2A visas. H1B visas are capped at 85,000 per fiscal year, with exceptions for certain fields.\n\nImmigrants made up 18.6 percent of the U.S. civilian workforce [PDF] in 2023, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, up from 18.1 percent the previous year. Compared to those born in the United States, greater shares of immigrants worked in service fields (21.8 percent of all foreign-born people); production, transportation, and material moving (15.2 percent); and natural resources, construction, and maintenance (13.8 percent).\n\nHow do Americans feel about immigration?\n\nA February 2024 poll by Gallup showed that 28 percent of surveyed Americans considered immigration to be the top problem facing the United States. In a separate Gallup poll conducted that same month, the majority of respondents felt that illegal immigration was a \u201ccritical\u201d threat to U.S. national security.\n\nA Pew Research Center poll conducted in April found that some 60 percent of the registered voters surveyed believed that undocumented immigrants currently in the United States should be allowed to stay, with 36 percent of respondents saying that undocumented immigrants should have the opportunity to apply for citizenship. In addition, a large majority of Americans still consider immigration to be overall good for the country.\n\nHow has Congress tried to address the issue?\n\nThe most recent push for an immigration policy overhaul was in 2013, following a decade in which Congress debated numerous immigration reforms, some considered comprehensive and others piecemeal. (Comprehensive immigration reform refers to omnibus legislation that attempts to address the following issues: demand for high- and low-skilled labor, the legal status of the millions of undocumented immigrants living in the country, border security, and interior enforcement.) The last major legislation to make it through Congress was under President Ronald Reagan in 1986, when his administration granted legal amnesty to some three million undocumented residents; in 1990, President George H.W. Bush further expanded legal immigration by increasing the cap for immigrant visas from 270,000 to 700,000, though he lowered the quota to 675,000 after several years. In 2007, President George W. Bush worked with congressional Democrats to reach a compromise on a new comprehensive bill, but it ultimately failed to win enough support in the Senate.\n\nPresident Barack Obama pressed hard for a comprehensive bill that would pair a path to legalization for undocumented residents with stronger border security provisions. The Democrat-led Senate passed this legislation in 2013, but the bill stalled in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. Both Presidents Trump and Biden put forward their own plans, which were not seriously considered by Congress.\n\nWhat was the Obama administration\u2019s approach?\n\nWith legislation thwarted, Obama focused on executive action, a tactic that his successors continued. In 2012, his administration began a program known as DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which offered renewable, two-year deportation deferrals and work permits to undocumented immigrants who had arrived in the United States as children and had no criminal records.\n\nObama characterized the move as a \u201cstopgap measure\u201d and urged Congress to pass the DREAM Act, or Development Relief and Education for Alien Minors\u2014legislation first introduced in 2001 that would have benefited many of the same people. Since then, more than 830,000 people have participated in DACA, and it\u2019s estimated that almost 1.2 million more were eligible as of 2023. Obama attempted to extend similar benefits to undocumented parents of U.S. citizens and permanent residents through a program known as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA), but the Supreme Court effectively killed it in 2016.\n\nIn 2014, Obama also grappled with a surge of more than sixty thousand unaccompanied minors at the southern border, mostly from Central America. He directed $750 million in aid to the region to improve conditions there. Meanwhile, his administration faced criticism for its enforcement policies, including detaining children in poor conditions and overseeing the deportation of more people\u2014approximately three million\u2014than either the Bill Clinton or George W. Bush administrations had.\n\nWhat was the Trump administration\u2019s approach?\n\nImmigration remains a signature issue for Trump. He blames previous administrations for failing to secure the southern border, and in his first term, he advocated for sharply reducing both legal and illegal immigration. He repeatedly used executive action to reshape asylum, deportation, and border policy.\n\nBorder security and enforcement. Trump vowed to expand the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, which he claimed would stop drugs and gangs from entering the country. He was unsuccessful in securing funding from Congress, leading to a federal government shutdown in 2019 and a subsequent declaration of a national emergency, which allowed him to divert funds to build the wall.\n\nOther enforcement measures under Trump included increasing border personnel; sending thousands of active-duty troops to the border; threatening Mexico with tariffs if it did not increase its own border enforcement; and attempting to cut federal funding to so-called sanctuary cities, or jurisdictions that refuse to enforce federal immigration directives.\n\nTrump also ratcheted up previous administrations\u2019 deterrence efforts. He implemented a zero-tolerance policy, under which authorities arrested and prosecuted everyone caught crossing the southern border without authorization. This caused thousands of family separations, since by law children must be held apart from parents facing criminal prosecution. (Presidents Bush and Obama likewise faced criticism for child detention, but they did not make separations a matter of policy.)\n\nDACA. Trump sought to end DACA, calling it unconstitutional. The move spurred multiple legal challenges and, in June 2020, the Supreme Court blocked Trump\u2019s plan. A December 2020 federal court ruling forced the Trump administration to resume accepting new applicants.\n\nTravel bans and refugee cap. Trump aimed to sharply reduce the number of refugees and other immigrants granted legal entry into the United States. In 2017, he instituted a ban on immigration and travel from several Muslim-majority countries, including Iran, Somalia, and Yemen. The original order was rejected by the courts, but the Supreme Court upheld a more limited version. Trump also lowered the cap on the number of refugees the United States accepts each year to less than fifteen thousand for FY 2021\u2014the lowest figure in the history of the U.S. refugee program. Additionally, he ended temporary protected status (TPS)\u2014a program that allows migrants from certain crisis-stricken nations to live and work in the United States for a limited period\u2014for several countries.\n\nAsylum policy. Trump implemented new restrictions on asylum seekers. In 2018, the administration began \u201cmetering\u201d asylum applications, or only accepting a limited number [PDF] each day. The next year, it launched the Migrant Protection Protocols, also known as the \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d program, which required asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their cases were processed in U.S. courts. At the same time, it sought \u201csafe third country\u201d agreements with several Latin American countries, which would have allowed U.S. authorities to send asylum seekers who traveled through those countries back there. Only an agreement with Guatemala was implemented before that country terminated it in 2021. Additionally, the Trump administration invoked Title 42, previously a rarely used public health law, to deny asylum on health-related grounds amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nComprehensive reform effort. Like his immediate predecessors, Trump proposed broad immigration reform. His would have created a merit-based system to replace the current one, which prioritizes family reunification. It also included an expansion of the border wall and an employment verification system known as E-Verify, but it did not address the status of current undocumented residents. Congress ultimately did not take up the proposal.\n\nWhat has been Biden\u2019s approach?\n\nAhead of the 2020 presidential election, Biden campaigned on overturning almost all of Trump\u2019s immigration policies. Since then, the Biden administration has reduced immigration enforcement within the United States, ended the travel bans, expanded green-card access for certain undocumented immigrants, and ended the controversial Title 42 policy, though it did initially maintain many pandemic-related restrictions. The administration also initially halted construction of the U.S.-Mexico border wall, though it has since moved forward with plans to build additional sections; expanded TPS protections; terminated the Remain in Mexico program (with Supreme Court approval); and raised the refugee cap to 125,000 for fiscal years 2022\u201324.\n\nHowever, Biden\u2019s efforts to undo Trump-era policies have been challenged by a historic influx of migrants at the southern border. The record surge in border crossings has prompted the administration to implement several new restrictions since 2023, including a so-called transit ban allowing the government to deny asylum to migrants who did not previously apply for protection in a third country. In addition, the administration can temporarily bar asylum requests when the number of illegal crossings exceeds a certain threshold; since the start of 2024, illegal crossings have slowed.\n\nMeanwhile, Biden has worked with Latin American leaders to increase aid to refugee populations, improve border management, and better coordinate emergency responses, even as his own comprehensive immigration reform bill and other border security legislation have failed in Congress. His administration has also launched efforts to accelerate the reunification of migrant families, including by reinstating the Central American Minors (CAM) program, which reunites children in the so-called Northern Triangle countries with their parents in the United States, and by creating a family-reunification task force. Additionally, Biden has pledged to invest $4 billion to address the drivers of migration from Central America, and he has sought to revive DACA; the Department of Homeland Security continues to accept and process renewal requests amid ongoing legal challenges to the program.\n\nDaily News Brief A summary of global news developments with CFR analysis delivered to your inbox each morning.

Some, including California and Massachusetts, allow undocumented immigrants to apply for drivers\u2019 licenses, receive in-state tuition at universities, and obtain other benefits. At the other end of the spectrum are states such as Texas, where the legislature passed a law [PDF] mandating that local governments and law enforcement agencies cooperate with federal immigration officers.\n\nThe federal government is generally responsible for enforcing immigration laws, but it delegates some immigration-related duties to state and local law enforcement. However, the degree to which local officials are obliged to cooperate with federal authorities is a subject of intense debate: dozens of counties across thirteen states are home to so-called sanctuary cities that limit cooperation with immigration enforcement.\n\nThe degree to which local officials are obliged to cooperate with federal authorities is a subject of intense debate.\n\nPresident Trump decried these sanctuary jurisdictions and reinstated a controversial Obama-era program known as Secure Communities, in which the FBI shares fingerprints of suspects collected by state and local law enforcement with federal immigration authorities. Under the program, state and local agencies also hand over individuals presumed to be in the country illegally. Biden terminated the program shortly after taking office.\n\nA range of court rulings during the Trump era increased pressure on states. In 2018, the Justice Department launched a lawsuit against California over sanctuary jurisdictions, which was ultimately dismissed by the Supreme Court. It filed similar suits against New Jersey and Washington, and a federal court ruled in 2020 that the Trump administration could withhold federal funding from sanctuary jurisdictions, including New York City. Under Biden, the Justice Department reversed this stance, leading the Supreme Court to dismiss several pending cases.\n\nThe ongoing border crisis has driven increasing controversy over local responses. After Trump called on states to deploy National Guard contingents to the southern border, several governors refused. Others, including Texas\u2019s Greg Abbott, embraced Trump\u2019s views, continuing to expand the border wall and seeking to boost the role of state and local law enforcement in carrying out federal immigration policy. In the Biden era, Abbott has sought to impose stronger enforcement at the Texas-Mexico border despite federal opposition. The governor signed a law in December 2023 making it a state crime to cross the border into Texas illegally and authorizing law enforcement to arrest and deport migrants. The bill remains on hold amid legal challenges; several other states are attempting to enact similar legislation.",

        "text": "Poll suggests Republicans who believe Trump won in 2020 expect significant chaos in November\nMedia Inquiries Name Hannah Robbins Email hlrobbins@jhu.edu Cell phone 667-232-9047\n\nRepublicans who believe Donald Trump won the 2020 election are anticipating a much more chaotic election cycle this year than other GOP, Democratic, and independent voters, according to new polling data from the SNF Agora Institute at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nLilliana Mason Associate professor of political science \"Expecting chaos can fuel more chaos. If we're not diligent, that chaos can unravel the foundational threads of our democracy.\"\n\nAmong Republican respondents who believe President Joe Biden did not lawfully win the 2020 election, about 31% think that either \"a lot\" or \"a great deal\" of political violence will occur after the 2024 election\u2014compared to 24% of Democratic voters, 21% of independents and just 12% of GOP voters who acknowledge Biden's victory four years ago, the poll found.\n\nIn addition, 65% of Republicans known popularly as \"election deniers\" also believe that the United States is \"very likely\" or \"somewhat likely\" to lapse into a civil war\u2014higher than the 40% of other Republicans, 43% of Democrats, and 46% of independents who expressed similar sentiments.\n\nThe poll questioned 2,000 Americans eligible to vote and was conducted July 26-30 by Lilliana Mason and Scott Warren from SNF Agora Institute and YouGov, a polling and data company based in the United Kingdom. The poll is the first of four that will take place during this election season and was commissioned as part of an effort to better understand the U.S. electorate and the growing divide between Republicans who do not accept the 2020 election results and those who do.\n\n\"Fortunately, most Americans don't think the same way as the 2020 election deniers. But that doesn't mean we're in the clear. Expecting chaos can fuel more chaos,\" said Mason, a political science professor who studies political violence and polarization and who is co-lead on the project with Warren. \"If we're not diligent, that chaos can unravel the foundational threads of our democracy.\"\n\nResearchers worked with YouGov to poll a demographically and politically representative sample of the U.S. electorate. Respondents were asked about their party affiliations, the 2020 election results, where they get their information from, and what they think about people from other parties.\n\nMost respondents\u2014nearly 70%\u2014think it's important to accept election results even if their candidate loses.\n\n\"For a free and fair democratic election to work, people need to believe in the electoral system and accept the outcome,\" said Warren, an SNF Agora fellow. \"Our elected leaders should heed the fact that the vast majority of Americans believe that our elections work, and that losing candidates should concede. Rather than sowing doubts, leaders need to talk about how these democratic institutions work and build trust with the electorate.\"\n\nOf note, 85% of respondents are still concerned about misinformation in the election.\n\nRepublicans who believe Trump won in 2020 are more concerned about misinformation than any other group surveyed and believe \"liberal media\" are responsible. These respondents also stated they are most likely to turn to \"their favorite television news anchor,\" \"friends and family,\" and \"chief election officers\" for information about the outcomes of elections in their states.\n\nDemocrats blamed misinformation nearly equally between \"Republican politicians\" and \"conservative media\" and reported relying on chief election officers for election results sooner than GOP respondents.\n\n\"We know that what leadership does matters. Leaders in politics and media have a real influence on their supporters,\" Mason said. \"If they continue to push a dangerous and chaotic vision of what the election might look like, they could end up creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. If they prefer to have a nonviolent election, there are some simple and easy things they can do.\"\n\nMason said that leadership can refrain from inflammatory rhetoric, clearly state that violence from supporters is unacceptable, and disavow violence when it occurs.\n\nResearchers will survey the same pool of respondents again in September, mid-October, and after the election in November to chart how their opinions and feelings shift over the presidential election cycle.\n\nOther key findings:\n\nIf the election were held today, 43% of respondents would vote for Kamala Harris and 42% would vote for Donald Trump.\n\nMost Americans don't trust the losing party to accept the election results. Only 16% of Democrats think Republicans will accept election results if their candidate loses in November, and only 15% of Republican election deniers think Democrats will accept the results if their candidate loses (50% of the other Republicans think Democrats will accept the results of a losing result).\n\nMajorities of all voters agreed that violence is not justified to prevent an opposing party from controlling the country.\n\nJohns Hopkins University is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit institution that does not endorse or oppose any candidate for public office.",

It\u2019s always going to be on the internet,\u201d he said.\n\nGreenwood, who is involved in the Republicans for Harris coalition affiliated with the Harris-Walz campaign, said it was hard to recruit anyone to the pro-Harris GOP effort after the debate, but he described the vibe after Biden stood down as \u201clike an electric charge.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve seen it. You know, the excitement, the volunteers, the fundraising, so everyone\u2019s pretty excited,\u201d he said.\n\nGreenwood also told The Independent he\u2019d been \u201call in\u201d for Harris to select Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, but he also had kind words for the Minnesota governor.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen of Governor Walz is that he\u2019s a very down to earth guy, very likable guy, and I think they\u2019ll make a great team,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother former Republican Congressman, Tea Party firebrand turned outspoken Never Trump commentator Joe Walsh, said Walz is just what Democrats need to appeal to working-class voters and shake off the party\u2019s image as a collection of effete elites.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s like an everyman \u2014 the Democrats have had trouble with blue collar regular workers and that\u2019s right up Walz\u2019s alley,\u201d he said. \u201cThis guy can go into any pool hall, any VFW, and he\u2019s down more than Shapiro is.

Tim Walz had grown up in West Point, a small Cornhusker enclave nearly 300 miles south of his future wife\u2019s hometown, and already counted several years of military service under his belt when he decided to ask Gwen out.\n\nThanks to encouragement from her sister, she agreed; their first date at the only movie theater in town \u2013 followed by a stop at Hardee\u2019s, naturally \u2013 soon blossomed into a romance, then a 1994 marriage. Exactly 30 years later, the two teachers and their two children now proudly hold the title of First Family of Minnesota \u2014 while throwing their hats in the ring for Second Family of America.\n\nSheila Flynn has more on the Midwest roots of Walz.\n\nPhotos capture first Harris-Walz rally\n\nTuesday 6 August 2024 22:48 , Josh Marcus\n\nKamala Harris and Tim Walz were in Philadelphia on Tuesday for their first campaign rally together.\n\nHere\u2019s what the scene looked like on the ground.\n\n(Getty Images)\n\nPennsylvania Gov.

The officer who stopped Walz smelled a \u201cstrong odor of alcoholic beverage\u201d, according to the police report.\n\nAfter failing a field sobriety test and preliminary breath test, Walz was taken to a local jail in Dawes County, Nebraska.\n\nThe incident took place 11 years before Walz first pursued political office as Minnesota\u2019s First Congressional District Representative.\n\nAriana Baio has the details.\n\nThe truth behind Tim Walz\u2019s 1995 DUI arrest and how it changed his life\n\n\u2018Thank you for bringing back the joy'\n\nTuesday 6 August 2024 23:42 , Josh Marcus\n\n(Getty Images)\n\nTim Walz is making that case that he and Kamala Harris will be happy warriors on behalf of the middle class and common decency.\n\n\u201cThank you for bringing back the joy,\u201d Walz began, praising Harris for her uplifting style.\n\nThe Minnesota governor also connected his small town upbringing working on a family farm to the values he said he\u2019ll bring to the White House.\n\n\u201cMy mom and dad taught us, show generosity toward your neighbors, and work for the common good,\u201d he said.\n\nWalz said this approach couldn\u2019t be more different than Trump\u2019s.\n\n\u201cHe froze in the face of the covid crisis,\u201d Walz said. \u201cHe drove our economy into the ground.

Here\u2019s why\n\n01:00 , Josh Marcus\n\nThe wait is over. Vice President Kamala Harris has finally picked her running mate in Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. Walz has become a favorite of online progressives recently, largely because of his \u201cweird\u201d attacks on Republicans. But there are also solid policy reasons why Walz is beloved of the left wing of the party. He went from a pro-gun rural Democrat in Congress to a governor who has signed legislation that protects abortion rights and LGBTQ+ rights, enacted background checks on guns, and expanded free school meals regardless of income.\n\nBack in August 2023, I tweeted: \u201cWalz would be a strong choice for Harris if she were to be the nominee\u201d.\n\nAlmost a year later, after Biden\u2019s debacle of a debate performance, just as Walz and other Democratic governors did a stakeout in front of the White House, I suggested him as a potential running mate for Harris if Biden dropped out. \u201cVeteran, longtime congressman from rural Minnesota. Popular governor who has passed major pieces of progressive legislation,\u201d is how I summarized my reasons why.\n\nMore from Eric Garcia.\n\nI predicted a Harris-Walz ticket a year ago.

Over the weekend, he accused Harris of having a \u201clow IQ.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, new polls indicate Trump is slipping behind the vice president in the popular vote and races are tightening in battleground states.\n\nKelly Rissman reports.\n\nRepublicans worry Trump is having a \u2018public nervous breakdown\u2019\n\nHow Walz might help \u2013 or hurt \u2013 Harris\u2019 chances\n\n04:15 , Namita Singh\n\nOpting for the Minnesota governor immediately calms the Democratic Party\u2019s left wing, which was worried that another contender, Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro, might have pushed the party closer to Israel and disheartened Arab American and younger voters.\n\nSome in Kamala Harris\u2019 inner circle saw Mr Walz as a do-no-harm choice who can keep the party unified heading into the Democratic National Convention opening in Chicago on 19 August.\n\nProgressives are already celebrating Mr Walz\u2019s ability to deliver an unapologetically populist message in the style of a Midwestern dad who recalls the social studies teacher and football coach he once was.\n\nActivists who for months have followed Joe Biden around the country to protest his full-throated support for Israel in its war with Hamas in Gaza are hopeful that Mr Walz will help Harris take a more nuanced approach than someone like Shapiro.\n\nBut some critics will point to 2016, when the only other woman to be nominated for president, Hillary Clinton, picked a mild-mannered dad with centrist views and a modest national profile: Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia. That ticket lost to Donald Trump.\n\nCori Bush becomes second Squad member to lose her primary\n\n04:23 , Namita Singh\n\nDemocratic representative Cori Bush became the second member of the Squad to lose her primary as county prosecutor Wesley Bell beat her in a grueling and expensive primary on Tuesday evening.\n\nPro-Israel groups spent massive amounts of money to depose Bush in the district where she pulled off an upset victory against a longtime incumbent Democrat in 2020.\n\nThe United Democracy Project, a super PAC of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, spent $9.2m against Bush, according to AdImpact. That made the primary the second-most expensive one of the year after UDP spent millions in opposition to fellow Squad member Representative Jamaal Bowman of New York.\n\nReport:\n\nCori Bush becomes the second Squad member to lose a primary as she\u2019s ousted from seat\n\nCori Bush becomes second Squad member to lose her primary\n\n04:34 , Namita Singh\n\nDemocratic representative Cori Bush became the second member of the Squad to lose her primary as county prosecutor Wesley Bell beat her in a grueling and expensive primary on Tuesday evening.\n\nPro-Israel groups spent massive amounts of money to depose Bush in the district where she pulled off an upset victory against a longtime incumbent Democrat in 2020.\n\nThe United Democracy Project, a super PAC of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, spent $9.2m against Bush, according to AdImpact.

Governor Peggy Flanagan would ascend to the governor\u2019s office, if Harris-Walz defeats Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance in 2024.\n\nFlanagan \u2014 a citizen of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe \u2014 would also become the state\u2019s first-ever female governor.\n\nAlex Woodward has the details.\n\nHarris-Walz could clear path for first-ever Native American woman governor\n\nVance offers battleground counterprogram to Walz\n\n04:49 , Namita Singh\n\nJD Vance is set to follow an overlapping itinerary to Kamala Harris and Tim Walz over the next two days, including stops in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nHis role is to attack the Biden administration\u2019s policies and tear down Ms Harris\u2019 record on the economy, public safety and immigration.\n\nMr Vance got out ahead of the Democrats in Philadelphia on Tuesday, holding an event hours before Ms Harris was to formally introduce her new running mate at a rally.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris holds rally with vice president pick Tim Walz, in Philadelphia (Reuters)\n\nHe said during his Philadelphia stop that \u201cI absolutely want to debate Tim Walz,\u201d but not until after the Democratic convention.Ms Harris\u2019 team seemed to be happy to have Vance making the contrast with the Democrats.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate JD Vance providing voters in battleground states exactly the split-screen that defines the choice this November,\u201d said Ms Harris campaign spokesperson Charles Lutvak.\n\nMichigan will choose between Democrat Elissa Slotkin and Republican Mike Rogers\n\n05:18 , Namita Singh\n\nFormer US representative Mike Rogers has secured the Republican nomination for a US Senate seat in Michigan and will face Democratic representative Elissa Slotkin in the November election.\n\nMs Slotkin and Mr Rogers, long considered the front-runners for their respective party nominations, will now shift focus to the general election. Ms Slotkin enters with a massive fundraising advantage and emerges nearly unscathed from a sparse primary, while Mr Rogers has the backing of national Republican groups and former President Donald Trump.\n\nFormer representative Mike Rogers and Representative Elissa Slotkin are set to face each other in November election (AP)\n\nMs Slotkin defeated actor Hill Harper in the Democratic primary, while Republicans chose Mr Rogers over former US representative Justin Amash and physician Sherry O\u2019Donnell. Both candidates will now compete for a seat left open by longtime Democratic senator Debbie Stabenow\u2019s retirement.\n\nThe retiring incumbent joined Ms Slotkin onstage at an event in Detroit shortly after the race was called to endorse her. Ms Slotkin praised Stabenow for her years of service before delivering a speech positioning herself as the \u201cnormal\u201d and \u201crational\u201d candidate.\n\nNorth of Detroit, in Oakland County, Mr Rogers thanked supporters at a watch party for \u201cnot giving up on politics.\u201d Like Ms Slotkin, Mr Rogers represented a mid-Michigan swing district in Congress, and he similarly positioned himself as the commonsense candidate in his speech. No Republican has won a US Senate race in Michigan since 1994.\n\nWith Democrats holding a razor-thin majority in the Senate and Republicans in the House, competitive races like those in Michigan are drawing lots of attention.\n\nIt\u2019s a vibes election \u2013 and Harris has picked the perfect running mate for the job\n\n05:19 , Namita Singh\n\nThey\u2019re calling it a vibes election.\n\nVibes are notoriously hard to spot, and they don\u2019t always show up in polls, but as Kamala Harris took to the stage in a cavernous auditorium at Temple University in Philadelphia on Tuesday with her new running mate, they were measurable in the screams and shouts of 12,000 people.\n\nThe replacement of Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket by Ms Harris has changed the energy in the room. And Ms Harris\u2019s choice of Minnesota governor Tim Walz as her vice presidential candidate is a sign that she is banking on that energy taking her to the White House.\n\nMy colleague Richard Hall reports:\n\nIt\u2019s a vibes election - and Harris has picked the perfect running mate for the job\n\nWesley Bell defeats 'Squad' member Cori Bush\n\n05:43 , Namita Singh\n\nSt Louis County prosecuting attorney Wesley Bell has defeated US representative Cori Bush in a Democratic primary in St Louis, marking the second time this year that one of the party\u2019s incumbents has been ousted in an expensive contest that reflected deep divisions over the war in Gaza.\n\nMs Bush, a member of the progressive congressional group known as the \u201cSquad,\u201d was seeking a third term in Missouri\u2019s 1st Congressional District, which includes St Louis city and part of St Louis County. Mr Bell is heavily favored to carry this overwhelmingly Democratic district in November, when his party is aiming to retake control of the US House.\n\nI am committed to serving the St Louis region in Congress with integrity, transparency, and dedication...Together, we will tackle the challenges ahead and build a community where everyone has the opportunity to thrive.\u201d\n\nWesley Bell\n\nMs Bush, in a fiery concession speech, said she still has work to do, even if she\u2019ll no longer be in Congress.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, whether I\u2019m a congresswoman or not, I\u2019m still taking care of my people,\u201d Ms Bush said.\n\nWhat to know about Tim Walz\u2019s origin story\n\n05:45 , Josh Marcus\n\nThe governorship of Minnesota may have launched Tim Waltz onto the national stage \u2013 and now into a battle for the White House \u2013 but it was the former teacher\u2019s wife who brought him to the Land of 10,000 Lakes in the first place.\n\nGwen Walz, nee Whipple, was born and raised in Minnesota before making a fateful foray after college into teaching across the border in Nebraska; there, she met another young educator and member of the Army National Guard. Tim Walz had grown up in West Point, a small Cornhusker enclave nearly 300 miles south of his future wife\u2019s hometown, and already counted several years of military service under his belt when he decided to ask Gwen out.\n\nThanks to encouragement from her sister, she agreed; their first date at the only movie theater in town \u2013 followed by a stop at Hardee\u2019s, naturally \u2013 soon blossomed into a romance, then a 1994 marriage. Exactly 30 years later, the two teachers and their two children now proudly hold the title of First Family of Minnesota \u2014 while throwing their hats in the ring for Second Family of America.\n\nFamily \u2013 both the one who raised him and the one he\u2019s built with Gwen \u2013 has deeply molded Walz\u2019s professional path and political positions.\n\nSheila Flynn has the full story.\n\nTeacher, coach and family man: Tim Walz is the Midwest dad courting the White House\n\nRepublican activist becomes first person to be convicted in Arizona\u2019s fake elector case\n\n05:49 , Namita Singh\n\nA Republican activist who signed a document falsely claiming Donald Trump had won Arizona in 2020 became the first person to be convicted in the state\u2019s fake elector case.\n\nLoraine Pellegrino, a past president of the group Ahwatukee Republican Women, has pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of filing a false document, Arizona Attorney General\u2019s Office spokesperson Richie Taylor said Tuesday, declining to comment further.\n\nRecords documenting her guilty plea haven\u2019t yet been posted by the court. Still, court records show Pellegrino was sentenced to unsupervised probation. Before the plea, she faced nine felony charges.\n\nSeventeen other people had been charged in the case, including 10 other Republicans who had signed a certificate saying they were \u201cduly elected and qualified\u201d electors and claimed Trump had carried Arizona in the 2020 election.\n\nPresident Joe Biden won Arizona by 10,457 votes. Joshua Kolsrud, an attorney representing Pellegrino, said in a statement that his client has accepted responsibility for her actions. \u201cLoraine Pellegrino\u2019s decision to accept a plea to a lesser charge reflects her desire to move forward and put this matter behind her,\u201d Kolsrud said.\n\nWashington state attorney general and Green River Killer detective advance in race for governorship\n\n06:30 , Namita Singh\n\nWashington state\u2019s longtime attorney general and a former sheriff known for his work hunting down the Green River Killer advanced on Tuesday to November\u2019s general election in the battle to become the next governor in a Democratic stronghold that hasn\u2019t had an open race for the state\u2019s top job in more than a decade.\n\nIn high profile congressional races, meanwhile, Democratic US representative Marie Gluesenkamp Perez advanced in the 3rd District and will face Donald Trump-endorsed Joe Kent, whom she defeated two years ago. And in the 8th District, Democratic US representative Kim Schrier will go head-to-head against Republican Carmen Goers, a commercial banker.\n\nFile: Marie Gluesenkamp Perez is pictured at the Capitol in Washington, 15 November 2022 (AP)\n\nA congressional race in the 4th District between US representative Dan Newhouse, one of the last remaining House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump, and two conservative rivals endorsed by the GOP presidential nominee was too early to call.\n\nUnder the state\u2019s primary system, the top two vote-getters in each of the contests advance to the November election, regardless of party. Because Washington is a vote-by-mail state, with ballots due to be postmarked by Election Day, it often takes days to learn final results in close races.\n\nMike Kehoe wins Republican nomination for governorship\n\n06:42 , Namita Singh\n\nMissouri voters have nominated Lt Governor Mike Kehoe to be the Republican candidate for governor, making the governor\u2019s race his to lose.\n\nSpeaking to a crowd of supporters in Jefferson City, Mr Kehoe described himself as an \u201cunderdog\u201d and said people doubted his campaign from the start.\u201cWe proved, once again, the American dream is still alive,\u201d Mr Kehoe said.\n\nMike Kehoe points to the crowd after announcing his win of Missouri Governor on Tuesday, 6 August 2024 (AP)\n\nMr Kehoe edged out Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft and state Sen. Bill Eigel to win the GOP nomination, a huge advantage in a strongly conservative state currently without any Democratic statewide officials.\n\nMr Kehoe will face off in November against state House Minority Leader Crystal Quade, who won the Democratic nomination.Republican governor Mike Parson is barred from seeking reelection by term limits.\n\nTrump leads Republican meltdown as Tim Walz unveiled as Harris\u2019 VP pick\n\n06:45 , Oliver O'Connell\n\nDonald Trump is leading the Republican party\u2019s meltdown over Kamala Harris\u2019s vice presidential pick, dramatically claiming that Tim Walz will \u201cunleash HELL ON EARTH.\u201d\n\nHarris announced on Tuesday that she had chosen Walz \u2013 the man who coined the now-infamous \u201cweird\u201d moniker for their Republican rivals \u2013 to join her on the Democratic ticket to take on Trump and JD Vance in the November election.\n\nThe announcement soon provoked an unhinged reaction from the former president whose campaign fired off a fundraising email warning that \u201cTim Walz would be the worst VP in history!\u201d\n\nJoe Sommerlad has the story.\n\nTrump leads Republican meltdown as Walz unveiled as Harris\u2019 VP pick: \u2018HELL ON EARTH\u2019\n\nKansas' former attorney general wins the Republican nomination for an open congressional seat\n\n06:48 , Namita Singh\n\nA former Kansas attorney general and failed candidate for governor has found at least initial success in his political comeback attempt, winning Tuesday\u2019s Republican primary for an open US House seat.\n\nFormer Kansas attorney general Derek Schmidt prevailed in the primary in the 2nd District of eastern Kansas over Jeff Kahrs, a former top regional federal health official, and Shawn Tiffany, a rancher. Even though Kahrs worked in former president Donald Trump\u2019s administration, Mr Schmidt won Trump\u2019s endorsement.\n\nIn the Democratic primary, former US representative Nancy Boyda, who held the 2nd District seat in 2007 and 2008, defeated Matt Kleinmann, a public health advocate who was a member of the 2008 national champion University of Kansas men\u2019s basketball team.\n\nMs Boyda won the nomination even though she riled up some party activists by positioning herself toward the political center for what she saw as a more viable general election campaign in the Republican-leaning district. She lost her 2008 race for reelection.\n\nMs Boyda was the last Democrat to represent eastern Kansas in Congress, and the district became redder after the GOP-controlled Legislature redrew it two years ago.\n\nMr Schmidt, who is also a former state senator, raised the most money of any candidate, more than $616,000, including more than $119,000 since mid-July alone, according to campaign finance reports.\u201cAmerica needs more effective, conservative voices in public service,\u201d Mr Schmidt said in a statement.\n\n\u201cI will continue to prioritize securing our border, stopping inflation, and rolling back big government\u2019s overregulation and over-taxation of our daily lives.\u201d\n\nWas Tim Walz arrested for a DUI?\n\n07:45 , Josh Marcus\n\nTim Walz chose to stop drinking alcohol in 1995 after he was arrested for driving under the influence, a story that has resurfaced after Vice President Kamala Harris announced the Minnesota Governor as her running mate.\n\nOn September 23, 1995, Walz, a 31-year-old, newlywed, high school teacher and football coach, was pulled over doing 96 miles per hour in a 55mph zone. The officer who stopped Walz smelled a \u201cstrong odor of alcoholic beverage\u201d, according to the police report.\n\nAfter failing a field sobriety test and preliminary breath test, Walz was taken to a local jail in Dawes County, Nebraska.\n\nThe incident took place 11 years before Walz first pursued political office as Minnesota\u2019s First Congressional District Representative.\n\nAriana Baio reports.\n\nThe truth behind Tim Walz\u2019s 1995 DUI arrest and how it changed his life\n\nI predicted a Harris-Walz ticket a year ago. Here\u2019s why\n\n08:45 , Eric Garcia\n\nEric Garcia writes:\n\nThe wait is over. Vice President Kamala Harris has finally picked her running mate in Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. Walz has become a favorite of online progressives recently, largely because of his \u201cweird\u201d attacks on Republicans. But there are also solid policy reasons why Walz is beloved of the left wing of the party. He went from a pro-gun rural Democrat in Congress to a governor who has signed legislation that protects abortion rights and LGBTQ+ rights, enacted background checks on guns, and expanded free school meals regardless of income.\n\nBack in August 2023, I tweeted: \u201cWalz would be a strong choice for Harris if she were to be the nominee\u201d.\n\nContinue reading...\n\nI predicted a Harris-Walz ticket a year ago.

        "text": "Democrats turn to influencers to help share their message on social media\nA look at how political campaigns use social media influencers\n\nAs social media feeds have become key battlegrounds in the race for the White House, Democrats are deploying a fleet of influencers to try to win over voters online.\n\nAwa Sanneh made a name for herself dispensing beauty tips on TikTok. When the 23-year-old posted a video of her White House bathroom break, her half-million followers took notice.\n\n\"I was just shocked. I was like, did you guys see that marble?\" Sanneh told CBS News.\n\nSanneh was one of a few dozen social media influencers who were invited to the White House to watch the State of the Union address and meet President Biden.\n\n\"He said to us, like, the collective presence in this room has more viewership on Gen Z than all of traditional media combined,\" she said.\n\nShe first heard from Democratic Super PACs, and then the Biden administration, after posting a video following the fall of Roe v. Wade that went viral.\n\n\"They started inviting me to their White House briefings on abortion rights, reproductive rights,\" Sanneh said.\n\nOn the right, Turning Point USA has mobilized influencers for years, raising nearly $200 million since 2020.\n\nNow, Democratic organizations are flooding the creator community with cash and providing behind-the-scenes access.\n\n\"We just have to be working with them. And if we're not, we're missing a huge way that voters are getting information about the world,\" said Rob Flaherty, who ran digital strategy in the Biden White House and now for the presidential campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nHe called the highly meme-able Harris a massive asset as the campaign reaches out to thousands of influencers.\n\n'We give them talking points, resources, base language, you know, graphics that they could repurpose or lift,\" he said of their campaign's work with influencers.\n\nAnd while Flaherty said the Harris campaign does not pay influencers directly, CBS News found a constellation of other Democratic political organizations that do.\n\nIn May, Future Forward \u2014 the super PAC supporting Harris \u2014 hosted panels like Gaming The Algorithm and How Advocacy Can Benefit Your Business. A spokesperson for the PAC did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSanneh said she was hired last month by Protect Our Care, a progressive advocacy group that relies on anonymous donors. She made a video warning about Trump's second term agenda that she says the group helped her script.\n\nShe said she takes their talking points and puts them in her own voice, saying she always discloses when she's being paid.\n\nWhile Sanneh would not say how much she's being paid, she did note, \"A video just for a creator in my size, an average can go from $3,000 to $10,000 and upwards.\"\n\nWhen it comes to hawking commercial products or sharing financial advice, federal rules require influencers to disclose when they are being paid. But in a rulemaking last December, the Federal Election Commission voted against similar requirements for influencers spreading political messaging.\n\nSam Woolley, the incoming Chair of Disinformation Studies at the University of Pittsburgh, says using influencers is \"a bid by campaigns to create authenticity at a small scale.\"\n\nBut he also noted that if people notice \"multiple influencers spreading the same exact message, you can start to realize like, 'hmm, some kind of coordination is going on.'\"\n\nFor Sanneh, her next stop is the Democratic National Convention, where she and other influencers have been invited to make more content\n\n\"They just told us that if we wanted to put on our own show that they would give us all the resources to do that,\" Sanneh said.\n\nWhen asked if she felt the Democrats were rolling out the red carpet for her and other influencers, she told CBS News, \"Definitely, and I'm glad to be on it.\"",

        "text": "About 3 in 4 U.S. adults say the 2024 election will determine the fate of U.S. democracy\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Roughly 3 in 4 American adults believe the upcoming presidential election is vital to the future of U.S. democracy, although which candidate they think poses the greater threat depends on their political leanings, according to a poll.\n\nThe survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that most Democrats, Republicans and independents see the election as \u201cvery important\u201d or \u201cextremely important\u201d to democracy, while Democrats have a higher level of intensity about the issue. More than half of Democrats say the November election is \u201cextremely important\u201d to the future of U.S. democracy, compared to about 4 in 10 independents and Republicans.\n\nDemocrat Pamela Hanson, 67, of Amery, Wisconsin, said she has grave concerns for the future of democracy in the country if Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump gets elected.\n\n\u201cHis statements tend towards him being a king or a dictator, a person in charge by himself,\u201d Hanson said. \u201cI mean, the man is unhinged in my opinion.\u201d\n\nBut Republican Ernie Wagner from Liberty, New York, said it\u2019s President Joe Biden\u2019s administration \u2014 of which Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, is a part \u2014 that has abused the power of the executive branch.\n\n\u201cBiden has tried to erase the student loans, and he\u2019s been told by the courts that it\u2019s unconstitutional to do that,\u201d said Wagner, 85. \u201cHe\u2019s weaponized the FBI to get at his political opponents.\u201d\n\nThe poll findings suggest that many Democrats continue to view Trump as a threat to democracy after he tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election, embraced the rioters who attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and threatened to seek retribution against his opponents if he wins reelection.\n\nBut they also indicate that many of Trump\u2019s supporters agree with him that Biden is the real threat to democracy. Trump and his allies have accused Biden of weaponizing the Justice Department as it has pursued charges against the former president over his effort to halt certification of the 2020 election and keeping classified documents, though there is no evidence Biden has had any involvement or influence in the cases.\n\nTrump has framed himself as a defender of American values and portrayed Biden as a \u201cdestroyer\u201d of democracy. He said multiple times after he survived an assassination attempt last month that he \u201ctook a bullet for democracy.\u201d\n\nThe poll, conducted in the days after Biden dropped out of the race and Harris announced her campaign, is an early glimpse of Americans\u2019 views of a reshaped contest.\n\nMajorities of both Democrats and Republicans say democracy could be at risk in this election depending on who wins the presidency, responses generally in line with the findings when the question was last asked in an AP-NORC poll in December 2023.\n\nHanson, the Wisconsin Democrat, said she worries Trump in a second term would use the conservative-dominated U.S. Supreme Court to overrule important freedoms. She also is concerned that he would fill his Cabinet with loyalists who don\u2019t care about the well-being of everyone in the country and defund agencies that regulate key functions of society.\n\nBut Wagner, the New York Republican, brushed off those concerns and pointed to Trump\u2019s time in office.\n\n\u201cWhen he was in the White House, we had peace, we had prosperity, we had energy independence,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s undemocratic about that?\u201d\n\nHe said he didn\u2019t think Trump\u2019s intentions leading up to and on Jan. 6 were criminal.\n\n\u201cI just think he was misguided,\u201d Wagner said.\n\nSome independents also are carefully considering the stakes of the upcoming election on the country\u2019s democratic future.\n\n\u201cI believe that this is the most important election of my lifetime,\u201d said 53-year-old Patricia Seliga-Williams of LaVale, Maryland, an independent who is leaning toward voting for Harris.\n\nSeliga-Williams said she\u2019s barely scraping by on $15 an hour as a hotel breakfast attendant and remembers Trump handling the economy and immigration well. But she didn\u2019t like it when he recently quipped that he plans to be a \u201cdictator\u201d on day one in office.\n\n\u201cWe all know Donald Trump could run the country,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he\u2019s just too aggressive anymore, and I don\u2019t think I can trust that as a voter.\u201d\n\nNot everyone agrees that this year\u2019s presidential election will be an inflection point for the country\u2019s democracy, offering starkly different reasons, according to the AP-NORC poll. About 2 in 10 Americans say democracy in the U.S. is strong enough to withstand the outcome of the election no matter who wins, while another 2 in 10 believe democracy is already so seriously broken that the outcome doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nThe poll also shows the stakes of democracy in the election are felt more by older adults rather than younger ones. About half of adults 45 and older say the outcome of the election is extremely important for the future of democracy, compared to about 4 in 10 adults under 45.\n\n\u201cMaking the claim that the other candidate is trying to destroy democracy, it doesn\u2019t really land for me,\u201d said Daniel Oliver, 26, an independent from suburban Detroit. \u201cI think that we have things in place that should safeguard against when you kind of play at destroying democracy. We have other branches of government. We have people that believe in voting. So, it would be hard for a candidate to take over and become some kind of dictator.\u201d\n\nHe said he\u2019ll be looking for candidates to talk about issues he\u2019s more interested in, such as reducing inflation and investing in clean energy sources.\n\nBiden and Trump spent months sparring over whose second term would be worse for democracy. The president nodded to the consequences when he ended his campaign last month, saying in his Oval Office address that \u201cthe defense of democracy is more important than any title.\u201d\n\nHarris has focused more on the concept of \u201cfreedom\u201d in the early days of her campaign. She has said Trump\u2019s reelection could result in Americans losing the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence and the freedom for women to make decisions about their own bodies. Her debut campaign ad last month was set to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s 2016 track \u201cFreedom,\u201d and it has become a campaign anthem for her at rallies ever since.\n\nHarris didn\u2019t mention democracy in her first two presidential campaign rallies, but she returned to the topic in remarks to Sigma Gamma Rho sorority members in Houston last week, saying \u201cour fundamental freedoms are on the ballot, and so is our democracy.\u201d\n\nThe poll of 1,143 adults was conducted July 25-29, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC\u2019s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 4.1 percentage points.",

        "text": "Iran Targeting 2024 US Election\nToday we\u2019re sharing intelligence about activity we\u2019ve been tracking that increasingly points to Iran\u2019s intent to influence this year\u2019s US presidential election. In recent weeks, groups connected with the Iranian government have upped two kinds of activity. First, they\u2019ve laid the groundwork for influence campaigns on trending election-related topics and begun to activate these campaigns in an apparent effort to stir up controversy or sway voters \u2013 especially in swing states. Second, they\u2019ve launched operations that Microsoft assesses are designed to gain intelligence on political campaigns and help enable them to influence the elections in the future.\n\nWe discuss this activity in a new report we released today, which details this activity, and four examples illuminate what we can increasingly expect from Iran as we near November.\n\nOne Iranian group has been launching covert news sites targeting US voter groups on opposing ends of the political spectrum. One of the sites, called Nio Thinker, caters to left-leaning audiences and insults former president Donald Trump, calling him an \u201copioid-pilled elephant in the MAGA china shop\u201d and a \u201craving mad litigiosaur.\u201d Another, called Savannah Time, claims to be a \u201ctrusted source for conservative news in the vibrant city of Savannah\u201d and focuses on topics including LGBTQ+ issues and gender reassignment. The evidence we found suggests the sites are using AI-enabled services to plagiarize at least some of their content from US publications.\n\nA separate Iranian group has been setting the groundwork for US-focused influence operations since March. We believe this group may be setting itself up for activities that are even more extreme, including intimidation or inciting violence against political figures or groups, with the ultimate goals of inciting chaos, undermining authorities, and sowing doubt about election integrity.\n\nYet another Iranian group, this one connected with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC, sent a spear phishing email in June to a high-ranking official on a presidential campaign from the compromised email account of a former senior advisor. The email contained a link that would direct traffic through a domain controlled by the group before routing to the website of the provided link. Within days of this activity, the same group unsuccessfully attempted to log into an account belonging to a former presidential candidate. We\u2019ve since notified those targeted.\n\nA fourth Iranian group compromised an account of a county-level government employee in a swing state. The compromise was part of a broader password spray operation and Microsoft Threat Intelligence did not observe the actor gain additional access beyond the single account, making it hard to discern the group\u2019s ultimate objectives. Since early 2023, the group\u2019s operations have focused on strategic intelligence collection particularly in satellite, defense, and health sectors with some targeting of US government organizations, often in swing states.\n\nThe Microsoft Threat Intelligence Report we\u2019re releasing today is from the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center, or MTAC, which tracks influence operations from specific nation-state groups around the world. MTAC routinely tracks threats to elections as part of Microsoft\u2019s broader Democracy Forward work and this builds on work the team did to track threats to recent elections in India, the UK, and France. Today\u2019s update also includes activity we have observed by actors advancing the geopolitical goals of Russia and China, each to varying degrees of effectiveness.\n\nWe share intelligence like this so voters, government institutions, candidates, parties, and others can be aware of influence campaigns and protect themselves from threats. We\u2019ve also been training candidates and parties involved in elections this year, building on our longstanding offerings, like AccountGuard. Finally, Microsoft will not endorse a candidate or political party. Our goal in releasing these reports is to underscore the importance of combating election deepfakes and promoting education and learning about possible foreign interference.\n\nTags: AI, Iran, MTAC",

        "text": "Majority of US adults say democracy is on the ballot but they differ on the threat: AP-NORC poll\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Roughly 3 in 4 American adults believe the upcoming presidential election is vital to the future of U.S. democracy, although which candidate they think poses the greater threat depends on their political leanings, according to a poll.\n\nFILE \u2013 Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump and Republican vice presidential nominee Sen.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) FILE \u2013 Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz arrive at a campaign rally in Philadelphia, Aug. 6, 2024. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke)\n\nThe survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that most Democrats, Republicans and independents see the election as \u201cvery important\u201d or \u201cextremely important\u201d to democracy, while Democrats have a higher level of intensity about the issue. More than half of Democrats say the November election is \u201cextremely important\u201d to the future of U.S. democracy, compared to about 4 in 10 independents and Republicans.\n\nDemocrat Pamela Hanson, 67, of Amery, Wisconsin, said she has grave concerns for the future of democracy in the country if Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump gets elected.\n\n\u201cHis statements tend towards him being a king or a dictator, a person in charge by himself,\u201d Hanson said. \u201cI mean, the man is unhinged in my opinion.\u201d\n\nBut Republican Ernie Wagner from Liberty, New York, said it\u2019s President Joe Biden\u2019s administration \u2014 of which Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, is a part \u2014 that has abused the power of the executive branch.\n\n\u201cBiden has tried to erase the student loans, and he\u2019s been told by the courts that it\u2019s unconstitutional to do that,\u201d said Wagner, 85. \u201cHe\u2019s weaponized the FBI to get at his political opponents.\u201d\n\nThe poll findings suggest that many Democrats continue to view Trump as a threat to democracy after he tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election, embraced the rioters who attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and threatened to seek retribution against his opponents if he wins reelection.\n\nBut they also indicate that many of Trump\u2019s supporters agree with him that Biden is the real threat to democracy. Trump and his allies have accused Biden of weaponizing the Justice Department as it has pursued charges against the former president over his effort to halt certification of the 2020 election and keeping classified documents, though there is no evidence Biden has had any involvement or influence in the cases.\n\nTrump has framed himself as a defender of American values and portrayed Biden as a \u201cdestroyer\u201d of democracy. He said multiple times after he survived an assassination attempt last month that he \u201ctook a bullet for democracy.\u201d\n\nThe poll, conducted in the days after Biden dropped out of the race and Harris announced her campaign, is an early glimpse of Americans\u2019 views of a reshaped contest.\n\nMajorities of both Democrats and Republicans say democracy could be at risk in this election depending on who wins the presidency, responses generally in line with the findings when the question was last asked in an AP-NORC poll in December 2023.\n\nHanson, the Wisconsin Democrat, said she worries Trump in a second term would use the conservative-dominated U.S. Supreme Court to overrule important freedoms. She also is concerned that he would fill his Cabinet with loyalists who don\u2019t care about the well-being of everyone in the country and defund agencies that regulate key functions of society.\n\nBut Wagner, the New York Republican, brushed off those concerns and pointed to Trump\u2019s time in office.\n\n\u201cWhen he was in the White House, we had peace, we had prosperity, we had energy independence,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s undemocratic about that?\u201d\n\nHe said he didn\u2019t think Trump\u2019s intentions leading up to and on Jan. 6 were criminal.\n\n\u201cI just think he was misguided,\u201d Wagner said.\n\nSome independents also are carefully considering the stakes of the upcoming election on the country\u2019s democratic future.\n\n\u201cI believe that this is the most important election of my lifetime,\u201d said 53-year-old Patricia Seliga-Williams of LaVale, Maryland, an independent who is leaning toward voting for Harris.\n\nSeliga-Williams said she\u2019s barely scraping by on $15 an hour as a hotel breakfast attendant and remembers Trump handling the economy and immigration well. But she didn\u2019t like it when he recently quipped that he plans to be a \u201cdictator\u201d on day one in office.\n\n\u201cWe all know Donald Trump could run the country,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he\u2019s just too aggressive anymore, and I don\u2019t think I can trust that as a voter.\u201d\n\nNot everyone agrees that this year\u2019s presidential election will be an inflection point for the country\u2019s democracy, offering starkly different reasons, according to the AP-NORC poll. About 2 in 10 Americans say democracy in the U.S. is strong enough to withstand the outcome of the election no matter who wins, while another 2 in 10 believe democracy is already so seriously broken that the outcome doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nThe poll also shows the stakes of democracy in the election are felt more by older adults rather than younger ones. About half of adults 45 and older say the outcome of the election is extremely important for the future of democracy, compared to about 4 in 10 adults under 45.\n\n\u201cMaking the claim that the other candidate is trying to destroy democracy, it doesn\u2019t really land for me,\u201d said Daniel Oliver, 26, an independent from suburban Detroit. \u201cI think that we have things in place that should safeguard against when you kind of play at destroying democracy. We have other branches of government. We have people that believe in voting. So, it would be hard for a candidate to take over and become some kind of dictator.\u201d\n\nHe said he\u2019ll be looking for candidates to talk about issues he\u2019s more interested in, such as reducing inflation and investing in clean energy sources.\n\nBiden and Trump spent months sparring over whose second term would be worse for democracy. The president nodded to the consequences when he ended his campaign last month, saying in his Oval Office address that \u201cthe defense of democracy is more important than any title.\u201d\n\nHarris has focused more on the concept of \u201cfreedom\u201d in the early days of her campaign. She has said Trump\u2019s reelection could result in Americans losing the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence and the freedom for women to make decisions about their own bodies. Her debut campaign ad last month was set to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s 2016 track \u201cFreedom,\u201d and it has become a campaign anthem for her at rallies ever since.\n\nHarris didn\u2019t mention democracy in her first two presidential campaign rallies, but she returned to the topic in remarks to Sigma Gamma Rho sorority members in Houston last week, saying \u201cour fundamental freedoms are on the ballot, and so is our democracy.\u201d\n\n___\n\nThe poll of 1,143 adults was conducted July 25-29, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC\u2019s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 4.1 percentage points.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

Vice President Harris and former President Trump have both confirmed they will attend the ABC debate. https://t.co/DEBOGC2ovO pic.twitter.com/t0KAWpcYOY \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) August 8, 2024\n\nHarris and Walz have headlined rallies in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin this week, drawing tens of thousands of attendees in a new sign of how her late entry into the race has energised Democrats.\n\nHer rapid rise has sent Trump\u2019s team scrambling to recalibrate their strategy and messaging. Opinion polls suggest Harris has erased \u2013 or at least shrunk \u2013 the lead Trump had built over Biden.\n\nDemocrats have also raked in hundreds of millions of dollars from voters and big donors in a matter of weeks.\n\nAsked on Thursday how he has altered his approach to the new challenge from Harris, Trump insisted he has not done so.\n\nIn a question-and-answer session with reporters that stretched longer than an hour, Trump moved from topic to topic, claiming Harris and Walz were weak candidates who were already dropping in the polls.\n\nDespite that, he lamented that he would not be able to face Biden in the election, suggesting that the president was a victim of an unconstitutional plot to dislodge him from atop the Democratic ticket.\n\nBiden, 81, dropped his faltering re-election bid under pressure from fellow Democrats worried about his chances of victory in the November 5 election after a disastrous debate performance against Trump.\n\nReporting from Washington, DC, Al Jazeera\u2019s Rob Reynolds said Trump has been attacking Harris\u2019s intelligence while pushing on with his usual anti-immigration rhetoric.\n\n\u201cThere were certainly a lot of familiar sort of rancorous remarks in this press conference about crowd size,\u201d Reynolds said. \u201cThe Republican candidate Donald Trump seemed to get very, very upset when there was some suggestion that Kamla Harris was drawing large crowds. So he went on an extended riff about that.\u201d\n\nEchoing a recent criticism from his campaign, Trump criticised Harris on Thursday for not doing a news interview since launching her campaign.\n\n\u201cShe can\u2019t do an interview. She\u2019s barely competent,\u201d Trump said, later again calling her \u201cnasty\u201d, a go-to line that he often uses to disparage female critics.\n\nTrump has conducted a steady stream of media interviews, though many are usually with friendly, right-leaning outlets and reporters. On Wednesday, he called into the Fox & Friends morning programme and took questions from the hosts.\n\nHarris and Walz were meeting with autoworkers in Detroit on Thursday, following the United Auto Workers union\u2019s endorsement of their candidacy, as part of a push to mobilise blue-collar workers in key battleground states.\n\nThe Harris campaign cancelled events on Thursday in North Carolina and on Friday in Georgia, where Tropical Storm Debby is bringing heavy rain and dangerous flooding. The Democrats will head to Arizona and Nevada later this week, visiting two more swing states likely to play a key role in the election.\n\nTrump\u2019s running mate, Senator JD Vance of Ohio, also cancelled campaign events in North Carolina on Thursday due to the storm. He has spent the last few days trailing Harris and Walz around the country, an unusual move intended to provide a \u201ccontrast\u201d, he told reporters on Wednesday.",

        "text": "August 7, 2024, presidential campaign news\nTim Walz speaks at a campaign rally on August 7. Julia Nikhinson/AP\n\nGov. Tim Walz, Kamala Harris\u2019 vice presidential running mate, refused to drop out of his congressional race in 2005 despite an Army National Guard announcement of a possible deployment, according to a statement from his campaign at the time.\n\nOhio Sen. JD Vance, Donald Trump\u2019s running mate, accused Walz of ducking service in Iraq when he left the guard and ran for Congress in 2005.\n\nWalz served in the Army National Guard for 24 years before retiring in 2005. He launched a campaign for Congress in Minnesota\u2019s 1st Congressional District that year and was elected in November 2006.\n\nWalz filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission as a candidate for Congress on February 10, 2005. The next month, after the guard announced a possible deployment to Iraq within two years, Walz\u2019s campaign issued a statement saying he intended to stay in the race.\n\n\u201cI do not yet know if my artillery unit will be part of this mobilization and I am unable to comment further on specifics of the deployment,\u201d Walz said in the March 2005 campaign release.\n\n\u201cAs Command Sergeant Major I have a responsibility not only to ready my battalion for Iraq, but also to serve if called on. I am dedicated to serving my country to the best of my ability, whether that is in Washington DC or in Iraq,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to speculate on what shape my campaign will take if I am deployed, but I have no plans to drop out of the race. I am fortunate to have a strong group of enthusiastic supporters and a very dedicated and intelligent wife. Both will be a major part of my campaign, whether I am in Minnesota or Iraq.\u201d\n\nWalz retired from the Army National Guard in May 2005, according to the Minnesota National Guard. Service members often submit their paperwork for retirement months before their retirement date. It\u2019s unclear when Walz submitted his papers for retirement.\n\nIn a 2009 interview for the Library of Congress, Tim Walz said he left the Army National Guard to focus full time on running for Congress, citing concerns about trying to serve at the same time and the Hatch Act, which limits political activities for federal employees.\n\n\u201cI left in April of 2005 and for me it was just short of 25 years and it was to run for this office.

        "text": "August 8, 2024, presidential campaign news\nDemocratic vice presidential nominee Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz delivers remarks at a campaign event, on August 7, in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. Charles Rex Arbogast/AP\n\nGov. Tim Walz, Kamala Harris\u2019 vice presidential running mate, refused to drop out of his congressional race in 2005 despite an Army National Guard announcement of a possible deployment, according to a statement from his campaign at the time.\n\nOhio Sen. JD Vance, Donald Trump\u2019s running mate, accused Walz of ducking service in Iraq when he left the guard and ran for Congress in 2005.\n\nWalz served in the Army National Guard for 24 years before retiring in 2005. He launched a campaign for Congress in Minnesota\u2019s 1st Congressional District that year and was elected in November 2006.\n\nWalz filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission as a candidate for Congress on February 10, 2005. The next month, after the guard announced a possible deployment to Iraq within two years, Walz\u2019s campaign issued a statement saying he intended to stay in the race.\n\n\u201cI do not yet know if my artillery unit will be part of this mobilization and I am unable to comment further on specifics of the deployment,\u201d Walz said in the March 2005 campaign release.\n\n\u201cAs Command Sergeant Major I have a responsibility not only to ready my battalion for Iraq, but also to serve if called on. I am dedicated to serving my country to the best of my ability, whether that is in Washington DC or in Iraq,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to speculate on what shape my campaign will take if I am deployed, but I have no plans to drop out of the race. I am fortunate to have a strong group of enthusiastic supporters and a very dedicated and intelligent wife. Both will be a major part of my campaign, whether I am in Minnesota or Iraq.\u201d\n\nWalz retired from the Army National Guard in May 2005, according to the Minnesota National Guard. Service members often submit their paperwork for retirement months before their retirement date. It\u2019s unclear when Walz submitted his papers for retirement.\n\nIn a 2009 interview for the Library of Congress, Tim Walz said he left the Army National Guard to focus full time on running for Congress, citing concerns about trying to serve at the same time and the Hatch Act, which limits political activities for federal employees.\n\n\u201cI left in April of 2005 and for me it was just short of 25 years and it was to run for this office. We were really concerned that we were going to try and do both. There\u2019s always the Hatch Act and some of the things that you have to be very careful of,\u201d Walz said in the interview.\n\nThe Harris campaign did not immediately respond when asked about when Walz submitted his retirement paperwork.",

Was it because the Democrat presumptive candidate found him as radical as Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance ? According to 'The Telegraph', like Team Trump, the Harris campaign wanted to placate its radical wing. Donald Trump 's running mate is more religiously devout than him and more passionate about conservative issues like marriage and family. So, the Democrats too wanted to select someone who could be portrayed as religious and conservative.The news outlet has also reported that Walz was selected also because the Democratic strategists apprehended that Josh Shapiro's selection would have upset the progressive forces in the party. His views on the Israel-Hamas War would have angered the progressive elements of the party as well as the general public. Besides, he is a Lutheran, unlike Shapiro who is Jewish.The Democrat strategists also believe that Tim Walz is more moderate than Vance, and he can attract many voters who do not want the crazy ways of the US politics. According to The Telegraph, Walz has a 'folksy norminess', he has invented the \u201cweird\u201d attack line that Team Harris is now trotting out. Walz looks like an ordinary American, he talks a lot about being a football coach, he goes shooting with his Republican friends, he likes eating corn dogs and explains why cookies are the \u201cultimate bipartisan entry point.\u201dThe Harris campaign wanted to placate its radical wing as Donald Trump's running mate is more religiously devout than him.

Young men are checked out\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Guardian design\n\nWhen Donald Trump strutted on to the stage at the Republican national convention last month, it was to a raucous cover of James Brown\u2019s It\u2019s a Man\u2019s Man\u2019s Man\u2019s World. The song credits men with inventing cars, trains, lights, boats, toys and commerce. The message was not subtle. At least, not to Melissa Deckman.\n\n\u201cThis idea of America needing someone who is a strong masculine figure \u2013 I think the Republican campaign this year is doing it even in a more pronounced and overt way than it did in 2016,\u201d said Deckman, CEO of the Public Religion Research Institute. \u201cYou have a lot of younger men admiring the strength of Trump \u2013 or what they think is strong.\u201d\n\nDeckman would know. In her forthcoming book The Politics of Gen Z: How the Youngest Voters Will Shape Our Democracy, she dives into the deep political divides between gen Z women and men and explores how they feel about growing up in the Trump era. Based on interviews with roughly 90 gen Z political activists, numerous focus groups and extensive polling, Deckman has identified what she calls a \u201chistoric reverse gender gap\u201d.\n\nView image in fullscreen Melissa Deckman has found that gen Z men are more conservative than their millennial counterparts. Photograph: Charles Belt/Melissa Deckman\n\nShe has found that gen Z men are becoming more conservative as well as increasingly indifferent to politics, bucking longstanding trends, dating back at least to the 1970s, that saw young people across the board voting liberal and men being generally more involved in politics than women. Meanwhile, gen Z women have not only become the most progressive cohort in US history but are also expected to outpace their male peers across virtually every measure of political involvement, such as donating money, volunteering for campaigns, registering people to vote \u2013 and, of course, voting.\n\nYoung women were outstripping men on political engagement well before Joe Biden stepped aside in favor of Kamala Harris, setting the internet ablaze with memes and teeing up yet another presidential contest between Trump and a woman. Now, with Harris the presumptive Democratic nominee, a generation already riven by a canyon-wide political gender gap is watching a contest between a woman who could become the nation\u2019s first Black and south Asian female president and a man who likes calling women \u201cnasty\u201d.\n\n\u201cFor me, the question come November is gonna be: to what extent do attitudes about gender influence the vote for Trump?\u201d Deckman asked.\n\nPolls indicate that young men\u2019s views on gender, femininity and masculinity are rapidly shifting. In 2022, 49% of gen Z men said that the United States had become \u201ctoo soft and feminine\u201d, Deckman found. Just a year later, 60% of gen Z men said the same. Deckman found that those who agreed with the statement were far more likely to have voted for Trump in 2016 \u2013 even after controlling for political party.\n\nNo matter their age, women have long voted at higher rates than men \u2013 but that is the only political activity where they have consistently exceeded men. Men historically donated more, volunteered with campaigns more and otherwise participated in political life more. This year, Deckman believes young women will surpass young men not only at voting, but in all political activities.\n\nDemocrats have historically had a firm grip on voters under 30 \u2013 a grip they may now be losing. Gen Z men, Deckman noted, have \u201creverted to the mean of men\u201d: while they\u2019re not necessarily more conservative that most men, they are more conservative than their millennial counterparts.\n\nNot all men\n\nThese trends are even more pronounced among white gen Z men. If you combine the number of independent gen Z men who lean Republican with those who identify as Republicans, Deckman said, young white men \u201clook very conservative compared to even older white men\u201d. She believes Trump will probably win young white men.\n\nIn 2020, 49% of white men between the ages of 18 and 29 voted for Biden, according to an analysis of AP VoteCast data by the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement. Meanwhile, 42% voted for Trump.\n\nThe damage that could do to Harris, however, is mitigated by the fact that white men make up a shrinking segment of gen Z. About half of gen Z is white, making it the most diverse generation in US history. Several polls have suggested that Trump could win among young Black and Latino men \u2013 a claim that Deckman eyes with suspicion, especially since Harris has entered the race and the GOP seems unable to stop themselves from making racist comments about her. Some Republicans have started calling Harris the \u201cfirst DEI president\u201d.\n\nDeckman\u2019s surveys have found that gen Z men are less likely than their female counterparts to say that racial equality is important to them, but 45% do believe that it\u2019s important, including 52% of Black gen Z men.\n\n\u201cIf Donald Trump uses misogynistic, racist language toward Kamala Harris, I think the net effect for young men will be more off-putting than not,\u201d Deckman said. \u201cThe end result for him is a net negative. It\u2019s also, of course, wrong.\u201d\n\n\u2018They don\u2019t care\u2019\n\nAnother mitigating factor could help Harris: young men don\u2019t seem all that interested in politics, period.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t care,\u201d Deckman said. In surveys, \u201cI asked them: what are you passionate about? What issues are critically important to you? There\u2019s like 20% gaps between young men and young women on everything.\u201d\n\nIn addition to caring more about issues like LGBTQ+ rights and abortion, as might be expected, gen Z women care more about economic issues like inflation, jobs and unemployment, which are typically thought to be more important to men. (LGBTQ+ zoomers also cared equally or more about every issue than straight zoomers.) Even men who agree that the US is too \u201csoft and feminine\u201d don\u2019t feel more motivated to act. Instead, it is Democratic women who reject that notion who tend to get more involved in politics.\n\nWhile young men fall behind women in political engagement, women have, over the last few decades, gone to college and joined the workforce at higher and higher rates. These trends are not unrelated. The more education and money you have, the more likely you are to be invested in politics.\n\nFeeling like your rights are under \u201cdirect threat\u201d also increases political involvement \u2013 and in the age of Trump, #MeToo and the fall of Roe v Wade, plenty of gen Z women feel like their rights are under threat. Gen Z men just don\u2019t feel the same urgency.\n\nSurprisingly, there is one area of political involvement where young men and women feel similarly: they are both deeply uninterested in running for office. Women have long been less interested in running for office than men. But as of 2022, Deckman found, only 6% of gen Z men said they definitely planned to run for office, while 4% of gen Z women said the same. Despite women\u2019s political enthusiasm, zoomers as a whole remain unconvinced that joining government is worth it.\n\n\u201cGen Z is far less likely to be confident in the federal government, in the media, in organized religion, in the police, in the criminal justice system,\u201d Deckman said. \u201cThis is just endemic to a generation of young people who have grown up in one crisis after another.\u201d",

He means it, all this stuff about \u2018if we lose it will be a bloodbath\u2019.\u201d\n\nIn his first interview since he dramatically dropped out of the race last month, Mr Biden told CBS News: \u201cIf Trump loses, I'm not confident at all.\"\n\nUS President Joe Biden has said he is not confident there will be a peaceful transition of power if Donald Trump loses the presidential election in November.\n\nDemocrats were quick to reiterate their campaign message that the former president poses a threat to democracy. The Biden campaign used the \u201cbloodbath\u201d comment in an ad - posted on its social media accounts - and a spokesman accused Mr Trump of \u201cencouraging and excusing political violence\u201d.\n\nThe Trump campaign, however, said the comment was specifically about the auto industry and had been deliberately taken out of context. It sent a fundraising email which said Trump\u2019s political opponents and others had been \"viciously\" misquoting him.\n\n\"[They] fully understood that I was simply referring to imports allowed by Crooked Joe Biden, which are killing the automobile industry,\" Trump wrote on social media at the time.\n\nMr Biden has previously expressed concern that his former rival would not accept the result of the election.\n\nDuring the presidential debate on CNN in June - which triggered the crisis over Mr Biden's candidacy - Trump was asked directly whether he would accept the 2024 election results.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s a fair and legal and good election, absolutely,\" he responded, after initially avoiding the question.\n\nTrump made repeated unfounded claims of election fraud in 2020 after he lost that election to Mr Biden.\n\nHis supporters stormed the Capitol building in January 2021 in an effort to stop the election result from being certified. Many in attendance that day repeated the former president's claims that the vote had been rigged.\n\nIn the CBS interview clip released on Wednesday, which was posted on X, Mr Biden also appeared to suggest there were efforts to complicate the post-election certification processes, although it was unclear exactly what he was referring to.\n\n\u201cLook what they\u2019re trying to do now, in the local election districts where people count the votes,\u201d he said. \"You can't love your country only when you win.\"",

These bribes were allegedly paid to obtain and retain business related to providing voting machines and election services for the 2016 Philippine elections and to secure payments on the contracts, including the release of value added tax payments.\n\nThe co-conspirators allegedly funded the bribes through a slush fund that was created by over-invoicing the cost per voting machine for the 2016 Philippine elections. To conceal and disguise the nature and purpose of the corrupt payments, the co-conspirators used coded language to refer to the slush fund and caused the creation of fraudulent contracts and sham loan agreements to justify transfers. The co-conspirators then allegedly laundered funds related to the bribery scheme through bank accounts located in Asia, Europe, and the United States, including in the Southern District of Florida.\n\nPinate and Vasquez are each charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and one substantive violation of the FCPA. Bautista, Pinate, Vasquez, and Elie Moreno, 44, a dual citizen of Venezuela and Israel, are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering and three counts of international laundering of monetary instruments. If convicted, Pinate and Vasquez each face a maximum penalty of five years in prison for the FCPA and conspiracy to violate the FCPA counts. Bautista, Pinate, Vasquez, and Moreno each face a maximum penalty of 20 years for each count of international laundering of monetary instruments and conspiracy to commit money laundering.\n\nPrincipal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division; U.S. Attorney Markenzy Lapointe for the Southern District of Florida; Special Agent in Charge Anthony Salisbury of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Miami; and Special Agent in Charge Matthew D. Line of IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS CI) Miami made the announcement.\n\nHSI\u2019s El Dorado Task Force Miami is investigating the case, with assistance from IRS CI Miami.\n\nTrial Attorneys Michael DiLorenzo and Connor Mullin and Assistant Chief Alexander Kramer of the Criminal Division\u2019s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Emery for the Southern District of Florida are prosecuting the case.

        "text": "Comparing the 2024 Presidential Candidates\u2019 Energy Agendas\nThe 2024 GOP Platform supports deregulation and incentives for traditional energy sources like coal, oil, natural gas, and some renewables. During the former President\u2019s term, he rolled back more than 100 environmental rules and former Trump colleagues have outlined a plan to continue to do the same. The Republican Vice Presidential candidate, JD Vance, has shown limited support for or opposition to most climate policies but has supported regulation as a response to environmental health, such as toxic spills.\n\nThe Biden-Harris administration supports investment in clean energy through the Inflation Reduction Act and various initiatives, including Justice40, which supports environmental justice efforts. Vice President Harris is expected to continue these actions with a potentially more progressive climate stance if elected. She previously supported a fracking ban, but has since reversed her opinion. Harris may emphasize environmental justice in her campaign but has yet to provide a formal plan. The Democratic Vice Presidential candidate, Tim Walz, has mostly aligned with Biden-Harris policies, at times going further to cut emissions, while also working with oil companies to rebuild the Line 3 pipeline project.\n\nMeanwhile, as of 2023, most Americans want the U.S. president to do more to address global warming.\n\nThe President can enact or dismantle energy policy in various ways. Here is a comparison of the candidates\u2019 energy policies and the mechanisms they might use. (Harris\u2019s specific 2025 energy policy goals are not included.)\n\nNote: please click on this image to see the detailed text.\n\nEasy to Execute\n\nExecutive Order and Agency Regulation\n\nTargeted Policies:\n\nEmissions targets\n\nInternational agreements and participation\n\nAgency initiatives and organization\n\nRegulating emissions can be targeted through executive orders, like Order 14057, or actions. Trump plans to exit the Paris Climate Accords and remove U.S. emissions targets, which are currently set to be reduced by 52% by 2030. During former President Trump\u2019s term, his administration rolled back more than 100 environmental rules , and Project 2025, a document created by the Heritage Foundation, outlines a plan to continue this effort.\n\nProject 2025 aims to remove renewable research or other science research groups within the Department of Energy. While the president has reorganization authority, there could be challenges with leaving allocated funding unused if the IRA already specified this money.\n\nWhile Americans have mixed views on natural gas, oil, and drilling, most support taxing polluters. Both candidates support \u201cenergy independence\u201d and reducing reliance on other countries. Both the Biden and Trump administrations have overseen a time in which the U.S. has led global oil production.\n\nA Trump presidency could reduce regulation and hurdles for oil and gas companies. Trump has called for tax cuts for U.S. oil and gas companies. Executive orders and rewriting the tax code could accomplish these goals, but they may require congressional support.\n\nA Harris presidency could continue to face legal battles on permitting action, such as limiting leasing on federal lands, withdrawing the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, and pausing approvals of new liquified natural gas exports. Harris has historically been slightly stricter on oil regulation than President Biden.\n\nBoth parties support expedited permitting, with Trump preferring traditional fuels, often done through an executive order instructing how agencies act on legislation.\n\nModerately Difficult to Achieve\n\nTax Regulation and Unallocated Congressional Funding\n\nTargeted Policies:\n\nRenewable energy project funding\n\nEfficiency standards for homes and vehicles\n\nMany proposed policies can be achieved through re-writing the tax code, pausing non-obligated funds, or changing how federal agencies allocate loans. Due to the recent ruling overturning Chevron deference, Trump would have more capacity to do so in this term, while Harris may see challenges disseminating funds where policy is ambiguous.\n\nThe IRA and Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors and Science (CHIPS ) Act are unlikely to be canceled without congressional action. A second Trump term would face challenges to repeal promised tax breaks completely, such as tax credit eligibility for electric vehicles, efficient vehicles, or appliances.\n\nGenerally, renewable projects like solar farms may face delays due to increased tariffs and shifting manufacturing priorities. Trump has previously expressed that he would implement an executive order targeting offshore wind. Still, it would be difficult to do more than pause loans and rewrite tax laws to slow the trajectory of renewable production.\n\nWith bills such as the IRA, CHIPS Act, and related executive orders already in place, continuing these efforts under a Harris presidency would likely not be as difficult as removing them.\n\nDifficult to Accomplish\n\nWithhold Congressional Spending\n\nFormer President Trump has pledged to cut wasteful spending within the federal budget, which is interpreted to include dismantling specific agency sections and rules. Congress sets the federal budget, and the president does not have the authority to withhold appropriated spending. Such action would require significant effort from the other government branches.\n\nWhile dismantling energy policy may be more difficult than during Trump\u2019s 2016 term, emissions projections reflect a need to continue and potentially double renewable energy and decarbonization to meet 2050 targets.",

        "text": "Election\u2019s Impact on Commercial Real Estate\nInterest rates and optics in an election year\n\nInterest rates and inflation may be top of mind for multifamily investors as election day approaches, but the Federal Reserve bases its decisions solely on economic factors, not political ones.\n\nThe independence of the Fed to manage monetary policy without regard to political considerations is fundamental. The Fed has consistently and repeatedly said its decision to adjust policy rates will be based on evidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward its long-term 2% average target to help maintain this independence and avoid any charges of partisanship.\n\nThe last meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) before the election is September 18. The proximity to the election and recently published quarterly economic projections will add attention to the meeting. But even after September 18, rates could be volatile as the presumed outcome of the election could influence the future of inflation.\n\nPotential housing regulation stability\n\nWhile increased funding for multifamily housing is possible, it\u2019s largely dependent on Congress. Regardless of the next president, however, it\u2019s unlikely housing funding and policies will be rolled back.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve increasingly seen a frustration with the cost of housing across party lines,\u201d said Nick Luettke, Associate Economist at Moody\u2019s CRE.\n\nWhile both parties want more affordable housing, they\u2019re likely to take different approaches. If either party gains control over the House of Representatives, Senate and White House, housing policies could see significant changes.\n\nIt\u2019s a different story with a divided government. \u201cIn that case, federal housing policies will likely remain the same, with the level of political polarization in Congress impacting commercial real estate policymaking more than the presidential election,\u201d Luettke said.\n\nThe election and economy\u2019s impact on infrastructure spending\n\n\u201cWith either outcome, there will likely be continued federal investment via the Infrastructure and Jobs Act into roads, bridges, power and grid, passenger and freight rail, water infrastructure, housing, broadband, airports and more,\u201d Chambless said.\n\nIt\u2019s important to consider the role of Congress here. \u201cInfrastructure spending will likely remain fairly stable should a split Congress and president be elected, with greater expansion or cuts being easier should either party successfully sweep,\u201d Luettke said.\n\nAside from Congressional election outcomes, infrastructure spending often picks up during economic downturns in response to rising unemployment. So there\u2019s also a possibility either administration could pour funding into infrastructure, depending on the economic landscape.\n\nSuch continued investment could benefit commercial real estate. Take modular housing, for example. \u201cModular construction\u2019s factory-like approach really drives costs down,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cThe negative is it\u2019s extremely expensive to move modular housing.\u201d\n\n\u201cInfrastructure spending is likely to depend more on macroeconomic health and whether deficit reduction or a stimulus is more necessary for a struggling labor market,\u201d Luettke said.\n\nReal estate and strategic supply chain spending\n\nLuettke noted that infrastructure legislation related to national security and supporting supply chains is the most vulnerable to geopolitical developments. It\u2019s also the most likely to be favored across administrations and congressional outcomes.\n\nBoth potential administrations appear to be acting tough with China on trade. Homeshoring and nearshoring are likely to continue regardless of election results. Both efforts can help commercial real estate and multifamily reduce development timelines and costs.\n\n\u201cIn the last eight years, conventional wisdom toward free-trade agreements has nearly disappeared,\u201d Luettke said. \u201cInstead, supply chain choices have increasingly been viewed as part of broader strategic relationships combining domestic protectionism of key industries with security,\u201d he said. Both potential administrations are likely to continue this approach.\n\n\u201cThere could be a number of impacts to global supply chains, including the prioritization of domestic investment, implementation of trade tariffs, and rebalanced and renegotiated trading relationships,\u201d Chambless said.",

        "text": "Election 2024: Trump and Harris say they've agreed to Sept. 10 debate\nDemocratic veterans in the House rushed to Walz\u2019s defense today \u2014 amid attacks from Republicans on the Minnesota governor's military record \u2014 and hit Trump over his lack of military service.\n\nRepublicans, including JD Vance, have attacked Walz in recent days over his military service.\n\nRep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., who did multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan as a U.S. Army Ranger, said Walz, who served in the National Guard for 24 years, had a \u201clong and honorable service record.\"\n\nWalz officially retired from the Minnesota National Guard in May 2005. His unit was alerted about a deployment to Iraq in July, and the unit deployed there in October. Walz filed to run for Congress in January 2005 with paperwork that was certified by the Federal Election Commission the next month.\n\nShow more\n\n\u201cContrast all of that with these old and tired attacks by the other side,\u201d Crow said. \u201cThey just don\u2019t have anything. They have no ideas. They have no options, but to try to do one of the worst things you can do in America: That is attack a veteran for their service. It\u2019s old. It\u2019s tired.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerica is just not going to put up with it. And we\u2019re not going to put up with it,\u201d Crow said. \u201cIt\u2019s not OK.\u201d\n\nRep. Jake Auchincloss, D-Mass., who commanded troops in Afghanistan, hit Trump over having received a draft deferment in 1968 for bone spurs in his heels \u2014 allowing him to avoid serving during the Vietnam War.\n\n\u201cIf I were Donald Trump, with five deferments from Vietnam \u2026 I would be very cautious about opening the door to attacks on those who served honorably,\u201d Auchincloss said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re Swift-boating him,\u201d he added \u2014 referring to the 2004 effort by Republicans who attacked then-Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry\u2019s record as a Navy officer in Vietnam. \u201cWe\u2019re just not going to stand for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thank JD Vance for his service, but his political career and his political positions are antithetical to the values of veterans, and Donald Trump has a long track record of disparaging veterans. He called those who gave their last full measure of devotion losers.\u201d\n\nThat comment was a reference to a 2020 report in The Atlantic that Trump had canceled a 2018 visit to an American cemetery near Paris because he felt that those who\u2019d lost their lives and been buried there were \u201closers.\u201d The magazine cited \u201cfour people with firsthand knowledge of those discussions.\u201d Several media outlets confirmed the remarks, which Trump has denied. Trump\u2019s former White House chief of staff John Kelly also said those specific comments were accurate.",

        "text": "Historic First for California: 16- and 17-Year-Olds\u2026\nIn a historic first for California, the County of Alameda, the City of Oakland, the City of Berkeley, the Oakland Unified School District, and the Berkeley Unified School District are pleased to announce that 16- and 17-year-olds in Oakland and Berkeley will be able to vote in their respective elections for school board in November 2024.\n\nThis historic expansion of the local franchise is thanks to the passage of Measure Y1, approved by over 70 percent of voters in Berkeley in 2016, and of Measure QQ, approved in 2020 with 2/3 support of Oakland voters.\n\nThe Alameda County Registrar of Voters is using California\u2019s pre-registration system\u2013the system that allows 16- and 17-year-olds to pre-register to vote in California as a whole\u2013as the system to register 16- and 17-year-olds to vote in their local school board races in Oakland or Berkeley. Therefore, a resident of Oakland or Berkeley who is 16- or 17- years old and who is otherwise eligible must use California\u2019s pre-registration system (https://registertovote.ca.gov) to register to vote as a \u201cyouth voter.\u201d Any 16- or 17- year-old residing in Oakland or Berkeley who previously pre-registered to vote will be automatically registered as a youth voter.\n\n\u201cI am very pleased to have the technology and processes in place to deliver youth voting, passed by the voters of Berkeley and Oakland through Measures Y1 and QQ,\u201d said Alameda County Registrar of Voters Tim Dupuis. \u201cThis has never been done before in California and we had to make sure that it was done properly. I would like to thank the Board of Supervisors for their support in helping make it possible for 16- and 17-year-olds in Oakland and Berkeley to vote for school board in November 2024.\u201d\n\n\u201cVoting is not just a right but a civic duty, and extending this right to 16- and 17-year-olds will foster a culture of civic participation from an early age. I am grateful to Oakland Council President Nikki Bas, Councilmember Rebecca Kaplan, and the Oakland City Clerk\u2019s team for all their hard work and leadership to make this new program a reality,\u201d said Oakland Mayor Sheng Thao.\n\n\u201cYoung people are directly affected by the decisions made by their local school boards,\u201d said OUSD Board of Education President Sam Davis. \u201cLowering the voting age to 16 ensures that their perspectives are represented in the democratic process and will compel local politicians to address their concerns.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy giving 16-17 year-olds the right to vote about their education, we help to create lifelong voters who are more likely to participate in future local and national elections,\u201d said Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arregu\u00edn. \u201cEarly involvement fosters a sense of civic duty and strengthens our democracy for generations to come.\u201d\n\n\u201cBerkeley has been working to bring youth voting to fruition for several years,\u201d said Berkeley Unified School Board President Ana Vasudeo.\u201d We\u2019re excited to empower our youth to exercise one of their most important civic duties this November.\u201d\n\nThe technical capability enabling youth to vote in this election is the culmination of years of work by the Registrar of Voters with support and direction from the Alameda County Board of Supervisors, the four involved local jurisdictions (City of Oakland, City of Berkeley, Oakland USD, and Berkeley USD), the team from Runbeck Elections Services, Inc. (the vendor for Alameda County\u2019s election management system), and community-based advocacy organizations. What might have seemed simple in 2016 when Measure Y1 was first passed turned out to require a complicated process in which every aspect of the election\u2014from voter registration to ballot mailing to ballot counting\u2014needed to be mapped, programmed, and tested specifically for youth voters. This process, while lengthy, was necessary to ensure the integrity of the election for both youth voters and traditional voters.\n\nKey Information/Dates for the November 5, 2024, election:\n\nVoter Information Guides will be mailed to all voters, including youth voters, starting Thursday, September 26, 2024.\n\nAll voters, including youth voters, will be mailed a mail ballot starting the week of October 7, 2024.\n\nThe last day for all voters, including youth voters, to register online to vote is Monday, October 21, 2024, although all voters, including youth voters, may register to vote in person at the Registrar of Voters\u2019 office (1225 Fallon St., Oakland) through Election Day.\n\nThe last day for all voters, including youth voters, to request a mail ballot replacement is Tuesday, October 29, 2024.\n\nIn addition, from when early voting begins on Monday, October 7, 2024, through Election Day on Tuesday, November 5, 2024, youth voters can vote in person at the Registrar of Voters\u2019 office (1225 Fallon St., Oakland).\n\nWithin the United States, only five small municipalities in Maryland (with a combined total population of all ages of only around 80,000) permit youth voting. Given the larger populations of Berkeley and Oakland, the potential youth vote in each of these two California cities is greater than all the Maryland municipalities combined.",

        "text": "\u2018Our lives are on the line\u2019: Why many LGBTQ+ people hope for a Harris win\nAt a recent celebration of San Francisco\u2019s vibrant transgender past, one speaker after another directed the crowd\u2019s attention to a worrisome future, casting November\u2019s presidential election as a turning point for the LGBTQ+ community and the nation as a whole.\n\n\u201cThis election will determine our fate,\u201d said Sof\u00eda Sabina R\u00edos Dorantes, deputy director of El/La Para TransLatinas, a local advocacy organization. \u201cIt will determine whether we continue to face discrimination and marginalization at [a] disproportionate rate, or whether we can continue walking toward the recognition and respect we deserve.\u201d\n\nFor the record: An earlier version of this article referred to an event in San Francisco as a celebration of Transgender Pride Month. The celebration marked Transgender History Month.\n\nLast week\u2019s third annual kickoff to Transgender History Month \u2014 the first to be recognized at the state level as well \u2014 was a chance to celebrate the advances of the transgender community in one of the nation\u2019s most enduring havens for LGBTQ+ people, with champagne served beneath the ornate dome of San Francisco City Hall. It was also a show of defiance at a dangerous time for queer folks nationally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThousands participate in the All Black Lives Matter solidarity march to mark LGBTQ Pride Month along Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood in 2020. (Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times)\n\nIn three months, Americans will choose between Vice President Kamala Harris, who is a Bay Area native and longtime LGBTQ+ ally, and former President Trump, who has a long record of attacking queer rights and has aligned himself with some of the nation\u2019s most virulently anti-LGBTQ+ political groups.\n\nIn chats with family and on nights out with friends, at gay bars and organizing meetings and on a virtual call of some 20,000 queer people last month, many LGBTQ+ Americans are making it increasingly clear that they view Trump and the broader Republican agenda as an existential threat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCalifornia Our Queerest Century With queer lives under threat, Our Queerest Century highlights the contributions of LGBTQ+ people since the 1924 founding of the nation\u2019s first gay rights organization.\n\n\u201cIt is not an exaggeration to say that our lives are on the line,\u201d said Honey Mahogany, executive director of the San Francisco Office of Transgender Initiatives. \u201cIt\u2019s whether or not we can survive \u2014 or will be in a position where we are in fear for our lives.\u201d\n\nIn advance of the 20,000-strong call hosted by the Human Rights Campaign last month, the group released a letter endorsing Harris from more than 1,100 LGBTQ+ leaders, organizers and celebrities.\n\nThe letter praised Harris for her decision as California attorney general to not defend Proposition 8, a state ballot measure that barred same-sex marriages, and for her support for the federal Equality Act, which would prohibit anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination in employment, housing and other areas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVice President Kamala Harris makes a surprise appearance at Capitol Pride DC in Washington in 2022. (Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times)\n\nThe letter heaped praise on the Biden-Harris administration as \u201cthe most pro-LGBTQ+ administration in history,\u201d noting its support for anti-discrimination policies and LGBTQ+ healthcare protections in the U.S. and its defense of LGBTQ+ rights globally.\n\nOn the call, Mawuli Tugbenyoh, senior co-chair of the Alice B. Toklas LGBTQ Democratic Club in San Francisco, said Harris has been a queer ally since before her first election as San Francisco district attorney in 2003 and is genuine in her allyship.\n\n\u201cVice President Harris has always been there for us and fought for our community every step of the way,\u201d Tugbenyoh said.\n\nOn Tuesday, queer rights groups also hailed Harris\u2019 selection of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate. They noted Walz has a record of allyship going back to the 1990s \u2014 when as a teacher he served as an advisor to his school\u2019s gay-straight alliance \u2014 and as governor has signed bills banning so-called conversion therapy and protecting gender-affirming care.\n\nThe same organizations have called Trump a major threat to queer families.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump appointed anti-LGBTQ+ officials throughout his administration. His Department of Education revoked school protections for transgender students, while his Justice and Health and Human Services departments rescinded anti-discrimination protections for transgender people, including in healthcare settings.\n\nTrump appointed a slate of judges viewed as anti-LGBTQ+ and banned transgender people from serving in the military \u2014 a policy President Biden reversed. In more recent years, Republicans aligned with Trump have introduced a flood of anti-LGBTQ+ bills at the local, state and federal levels, prompting the Human Rights Campaign to declare a \u201cstate of emergency\u201d for queer Americans last year.\n\nConcerns have only increased since Project 2025, a blueprint for a second Trump term produced by a host of former Trump aides, the Heritage Foundation and more than 100 other conservative groups, came into focus. The plan \u2014 which Trump has tried to distance himself from despite having close ties to its authors \u2014 challenges the existence of transgender people, calls the rainbow flag a \u201cdivisive symbol\u201d and demands a \u201cbiblically based\u201d definition of marriage and families.\n\nTrump\u2019s running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, who also has close ties to Project 2025 authors, has attacked LGBTQ+ rights and mocked queer people. Vance has opposed protections for same-sex marriage, LGBTQ+ workers and gender-affirming healthcare, called LGBTQ+ activists \u201cgroomers\u201d and held up the confirmation of overseas diplomats by questioning their support for LGBTQ+-friendly initiatives.\n\nTrump also has outlined various anti-LGBTQ+ policies in \u201cAgenda 47,\u201d his plan for a second term. It says Trump would end all federal programs \u201cthat promote the concept of sex and gender transition at any age,\u201d withhold Medicaid and Medicare funding from hospitals that provide gender-affirming care to children, ensure \u201csevere consequences\u201d for teachers who acknowledge transgender students\u2019 identities and revoke federal funding from their schools.\n\nHe concludes a campaign video about the plan with the demonstrably false assertion that the existence of transgender children \u201cwas never heard of\u201d until \u201cthe radical left invented it just a few years ago.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We\u2019re not going back\u2019\n\nNot all LGBTQ+ people support Harris. Stephen Schumacher, a gay 33-year-old political consultant, helps lead the Detroit chapter of Log Cabin Republicans, an organization for conservative LGBTQ+ people. He supports Trump.\n\nSchumacher pointed to the Republican Party taking its long-standing opposition to same-sex marriage out of its platform this year \u2014 after Trump ordered the document be slimmed down \u2014 as proof the party is coming around on the issue. He said Log Cabin events he attended at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee last month were well received.\n\n\u201cI feel like my rights are protected,\u201d Schumacher said.\n\nRichard Grenell, a gay Trump loyalist and former acting director of national intelligence in the Trump administration, once called Trump \u201cthe most pro-gay president in American history\u201d and this week predicted the GOP nominee will \u201cwin 50% of the gay vote.\u201d\n\nGrenell, of California, has railed against transgender youth rights and the Equality Act and been flagged as anti-LGBTQ+ by queer rights groups. On Wednesday he took up a Republican talking point about Walz, saying that Minnesota protections around sexual orientation somehow benefit pedophiles.\n\nAcross the country, many queer people find such beliefs flabbergasting \u2014 if not repugnant.\n\nJim Obergefell, the lead plaintiff in the 2015 Supreme Court case that won same-sex couples the right to marry nationally, said it\u2019s obvious that LGBTQ+ rights \u2014 including the right to marry \u2014 are under threat.\n\nJim Obergefell, the lead plaintiff in Obergefell vs. Hodges, the Supreme Court case that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, arrives for a news conference on the steps of the Texas Capitol in Austin in 2015. (Eric Gay / Associated Press)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Republican Party has made clear through statements, through policies, through basically everything they have done, that they do not believe that queer people deserve the same rights, the same respect, the same dignity,\u201d Obergefell said.\n\nRep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), who is gay and serves as chair of the Congressional Equality Caucus, said LGBTQ+ people have watched in recent years as Republicans have launched one attack after another on gender-affirming care, Pride flags, drag queen story hours, queer books and the mere mention of being gay in schools, and know it will only get worse under Trump.\n\n\u201cIn the Republican Party, there is a real regression when it comes to equality, and I could see almost anything being pushed forward,\u201d Pocan said.\n\nAmong those attending the Transgender History Month celebration in San Francisco was state Sen. Scott Wiener, who is gay. \u201cWe know that there are forces in this country \u2014 and we\u2019re seeing it more broadly now with Project 2025 \u2014 [who] have never gotten over the fact that we\u2019re no longer in 1950 or 1850 or whatever it is that they want to bring us back to,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve never gotten over that, and they want all of us to go away.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Wiener said, \u201cwe\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d\n\nDonna Personna, a 77-year-old transgender attendee who has lived in San Francisco since her teens, said Trump and other Republicans pretend people such as her never used to exist because they don\u2019t want to acknowledge that the American past they wish to see returned was a harsh and unjust place for so many.\n\nBy contrast, Harris has made \u201cWe\u2019re not going back\u201d a campaign slogan, Personna noted. \u201cAnd I\u2019m with her on that.\u201d",
