        "text": "American psyche: a new series exploring the angst at the heart of the US election\nThe vibes, to put it lightly, are off.\n\nThe 2024 election is proof that the country remains divided, with fault lines so deep that we struggle to collectively define the crises themselves, let alone what has caused them or what would offer solutions.\n\nOur current dissonance comes on the tail of past, enduring traumas which did nothing to bring us together. A virus took our loved ones, and we fought over masks. A shooter massacred children in a classroom, and we fought over guns. A Black man was suffocated by the police, and some argued if it mattered.\n\n\n\nIn the years since we last voted for a US president, the supposed protectors of justice took away a pillar of reproductive rights from half the country, and are threatening to roll back the civil rights achieved by and for millions in the 1960s. The majority of Americans believe we\u2019re in an economic crisis, even though unemployment is at historic lows. Many others are still litigating the validity of the last election.\n\nThere are a million people on the brink of starvation caused by war in Gaza, and we\u2019re fixated on college campus protests. And it has become a sign of political strength to put families, sick and threatened, on buses with no warning and send them from the border to cities several states away to win elections.\n\nMeanwhile, there is little consensus over what constitutes fact.\n\nThere hasn\u2019t been a moment to pause, or a moment to heal, in many years. And so the angst that American voters face is palpable, manifesting in our minds and bodies and collective choices.\n\nOur new series, American psyche, seeks to examine that angst, to define it. From now until the election, our stories will take on different angles of that angst: from a years-long effort to punish a single woman for a single vote to city dwellers increasingly scared of their own neighbors. The series will look at how young people\u2019s lives have been disrupted, over and over again, and how that leads them to believe who should run our country.\n\nThe US and its people are unsettled, simultaneously depleted and ready to fight. It is with this conflict, in and among ourselves, that we will choose our next president. It\u2019s our hope that these stories capture this moment, and that this moment, in turn, becomes an inflection point in the long road back to a thriving democracy.\n\nThanks for reading,\n\nAnkita Rao,\n\nWashington editor\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Trump\u2019s vows of \u2018revenge\u2019 against his opponents gain volume\nFormer President Donald Trump has been increasingly clear about his intention to use the power of the presidency to seek revenge on those he considers his political enemies if his bid to retake the White House is successful in the November elections.\n\nTrump\u2019s promises of retaliation are not new. Since entering the political arena in 2015, he has used the politics of grievance to motivate many of his supporters. While addressing a crowd last year at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, Trump declared, \u201cI am your warrior. I am your justice. And for those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution.\u201d\n\nHowever, in the days after he was found guilty of 34 felony counts in a New York state court last month, a case in which he has not yet been sentenced, Trump\u2019s promises of revenge have not been made on behalf of his supporters, but as a reaction to his own personal legal difficulties.\n\nClaims of persecution\n\nThe former president has claimed that multiple criminal indictments against him in various jurisdictions across the country are the product of a wide-ranging conspiracy to prevent him from winning the presidency again.\n\nHe places the responsibility for those prosecutions on President Joe Biden or sometimes on a shadowy cabal of people he insists are influencing Biden behind the scenes. That, he has claimed, would justify his own use of federal power to persecute them if he is given the chance.\n\nIn an interview last week with Fox News host Sean Hannity, the former president said, \u201cLook, when this election is over, based on what they\u2019ve done, I would have every right to go after them, and it would be easy because it\u2019s Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nLate last week, when Trump was interviewed on camera by psychologist Phil McGraw, the subject came up again. McGraw, a well-known television host commonly known as Dr. Phil, tried to convince Trump that seeking revenge as president would get in the way of his other political priorities.\n\n\u201cWell, revenge does take time. I will say that,\u201d Trump replied. \u201cAnd sometimes revenge can be justified, Phil, I have to be honest. You know, sometimes it can.\u201d\n\nAllies echo Trump\u2019s call\n\nTrump has signaled that one of his priorities if reelected will be filling his administration with loyal allies willing to do his bidding. He was frequently frustrated during his four years in the White House by appointees who balked at his demands that they violate long-standing norms, and sometimes the law itself.\n\nAlready, some Trump allies who are likely to be considered for White House jobs in a second Trump administration are echoing him. They have called on Republican officeholders to use the levers of power available to them to target the former president\u2019s political foes.\n\nIn a recent appearance on Fox News, Stephen Miller, a former White House adviser to Trump who would likely play a role in a second Trump administration, said, \u201cEvery facet of Republican Party politics and power has to be used right now to go toe to toe with Marxism and beat these communists.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs every Republican [attorney general] opening investigations into voter fraud, right now?\u201d he continued. \u201cIs every House committee controlled by Republicans using its subpoena power in every way it needs to, right now? Is every Republican [district attorney] starting every investigation it needs to, right now?\u201d\n\nFormer Trump White House counselor Steve Bannon has likewise called for Republicans to begin targeting Democrats, promising that such a campaign would only be accelerated if Trump is sworn in as president in January 2025.\n\n\"Judgment Day is 5 November of this year,\" Bannon said, referring to Election Day in a recent episode of his daily podcast. \"Accountability day starts on the afternoon of the 20th of January after Donald John Trump takes his hand off the King James Bible and we go to work.\"\n\nDemocrats\u2019 response\n\nBiden has frequently criticized Trump\u2019s promises of retribution but has said relatively little about the fallout from the former president\u2019s recent conviction in New York.\n\nHowever, in a recent interview with ABC News, the president criticized his predecessor for continually attacking the justice system as corrupt and called on him to accept the verdict against him.\n\n\u201c[S]top undermining the rule of law. Stop undermining the institutions,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThat's what Trump\u2019s whole effort is. He's trying to undermine it. Look, he got a fair trial. The jury spoke like they speak in all cases, and it should be respected.\u201d\n\nIn remarks delivered in Michigan over the weekend, Vice President Kamala Harris went further, saying of Trump, \u201cHe spreads lies that our administration is controlling this case, when everyone knows it was a state prosecution. And he says that he will use a second term for revenge.\n\n\u201cSimply put, Donald Trump thinks he is above the law,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThis should be disqualifying for anyone who wants to be president of the United States.\u201d\n\nUnprecedented for a president\n\nPolitical scientist James A. Morone, a professor at Brown University, told VOA that Trump\u2019s explicit pledge to use the power of the federal government to persecute his political enemies has no clear parallel in the country\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cThis is really unprecedented for a president to be doing this,\u201d Morone said. \u201cAnd really, the historical precedents are quite the contrary.\u201d\n\nEven after the Civil War, Morone said, there were no prosecutions of prominent former Confederate officials and military officers. Former Confederate President Jefferson Davis was arrested and charged with treason, but he was never prosecuted, and the charges against him were eventually dropped, allowing him to return to private life as a U.S. citizen.\n\nMorone said that Trump\u2019s rhetoric is particularly worrisome because it sends a message to current and future public officials who may feel they need to demonstrate their loyalty to him.\n\n\u201cEvery time he gives a speech or an interview that says, 'Revenge is coming. Revenge can be good,\u2019 they'll be sitting around thinking, \u2018OK \u2026 let's think of what we can do to put ourselves in good standing as Trump warriors,\u2019 \u201d Morone said.\n\n\u201cYou could easily imagine it leading to real harm,\u201d he said.",

        "text": "Ghalibaf among six approved to run in Iran\u2019s presidential election\nParliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf and five other conservatives approved to run in snap vote on June 28.\n\nTehran, Iran \u2013 Six people, including parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, have been approved to run for the snap presidential election on June 28 following the death of President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash.\n\nThe Guardian Council, a constitutional vetting body, approved former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili and Tehran Mayor Alireza Zakani to run, but 74 others were not, marking another election with wide disqualification of candidates.\n\nThe 62-year-old Ghalibaf, a former commander of the air force of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), has been parliament speaker for four years, was the mayor of Tehran from 2005 to 2017, and the chief of police before that. He ran for president in 2005, 2013 and 2017, when he withdrew in favour of Raisi.\n\nJalili, who is Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei\u2019s direct representative to the country\u2019s Supreme National Security Council, withdrew from the 2021 election in favour of Raisi, who won virtually unchallenged.\n\nMost prominent among those disqualified are Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the populist ex-president, as well as moderate candidate and former three-time parliament speaker Ali Larijani \u2013 both of whom did not qualify to run in 2021 as well.\n\nIran was slated to have its presidential election in 2025, but the vote was brought forward after Raisi died on May 19 in a helicopter crash in northern Iran. The 63-year-old Raisi was expected to secure another term in office and was a top name associated with the succession of Iran\u2019s 85-year-old supreme leader.\n\nSeven others, including Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian, were also killed in the crash, which the army said in a preliminary report last month did not occur as a result of criminal activity.\n\nZakani, who became Tehran mayor after withdrawing in favour of Raisi in the 2021 race, said in a post on X following his qualification on Sunday that he wishes to \u201ccontinue the path\u201d of the late president.\n\nParliamentarian Masoud Pezeshkian, former interior and justice minister Mostafa Pourmohammadi, and Amirhossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi, the head of Iran\u2019s Martyrs Foundation, cap the list of the six approved candidates.\n\nThe 70-year-old Pezeshkian, a veteran five-term lawmaker and former health minister, is the only candidate representing significantly weakened moderate and reformist factions of Iran\u2019s political landscape.\n\nEshaq Jahangiri, the former first vice president in the administration of moderate President Hassan Rouhani, was among those disqualified by the Guardian Council, along with former central bank chief Abdolnaser Hemmati, who had been allowed to run in 2021 and got 8 percent of the total vote, or 2.42 million votes.\n\nThe other candidates represent the conservative and hardline political factions, which have increasingly gained prominence since the breakdown of Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers after the unilateral withdrawal of the United States in 2018.\n\nGhazizadeh was also approved in 2021 and received 3.45 percent, or less than a million votes. Raisi won the presidency with almost 18 million votes for a 48.8 percent turnout.\n\nThe nuclear programme and Iran\u2019s economy challenged by high inflation and sanctions are expected to be some of the issues to be discussed during five rounds of four-hour debates that state television plans to host in the run-up to the election.\n\nTurnout has been steadily declining in presidential and parliamentary elections since 2020, with the March 2024 parliamentary election seeing 41 percent participation, the lowest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.",

        "text": "Key Takeaways from AJC\u2019s 2024 Survey of American Jewish Opinion\nHamas\u2019 massacre of Israelis on October 7, and the war that it started, has unleashed record levels of antisemitism in the U.S. \u2013 on college campuses, on social media, and in the streets. Despite the adverse effects of the war on American Jews, AJC\u2019s 2024 Survey of American Jewish Opinion discovered deepening connections between American Jews, their Jewish identity, and the Jewish state, as well as the importance of strong Israel education in fostering a deep connection to Israel.\n\nHere are five findings from the survey that illustrate how the American Jewish community is feeling after the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust.\n\nAJC\u2019s 2024 Survey of American Jewish Opinion, conducted by the research company SSRS, is based on interviews conducted online between March 12 - April 6, 2024, with a nationally representative sample of 1,001 Jews aged 18 or older. The margin of error is +/-3.9 percentage points at the 95% confidence level.\n\n\n\n1. Jews Are Deeply \u2013 and Increasingly \u2013 Connected to Israel\n\nAJC\u2019s 2024 Survey of American Jewish Opinion found that a majority - 85% - of U.S. Jews think it\u2019s important for the United States to support Israel in the aftermath of the terrorist attack on October 7. This statistic is critically important in light of the persistent narrative that Jews represent a significant percentage of anti-Zionist protesters.\n\nCampus protests, physical assaults, and antisemitic rhetoric online haven\u2019t dissuaded most American Jews from embracing their heritage. In fact, 57% of respondents said they felt more connected to Israel or their Jewish identity after the horrors of October 7. Only 4% said they felt less connected after the attack.\n\n\n\n2. Jews Feel the Rise in Antisemitism\n\nEvery month of 2023 featured a high-profile antisemitic incident, including bomb threats, violent assaults, and vandalism of sacred spaces.\n\nBut since October 7, it has gotten even worse. Following Hamas\u2019 horrific attack, 87% of American Jews think that antisemitism has increased in the U.S. with 55% saying it has increased a lot.\n\n\n\n3. Jews Are Concerned About Their Future in America\n\nA century ago, American Jews often called America the \u201cgoldene medina,\u201d Yiddish for \u201cthe golden land.\u201d Since October 7 though, 7% have considered moving to another country due to antisemitism in the U.S.\n\nThe Israel-Hamas war has also affected American Jews\u2019 personal or work relationships in several ways. Overall, 64% of American Jews reported that the horrific event halfway around the world affected, in one way or another, their relationships here at home. More than half (53%) avoided talking about the Israel-Hamas war with other people. More than one in ten (12%) American Jews ended a friendship or relationship with a person because they expressed antisemitic views. And when meeting someone new, 27% of U.S. Jews hid their Jewish identity or chose not to disclose it.\n\n\n\n4. The Jewish Vote Hasn\u2019t Changed\n\nWhen asked about the upcoming presidential election, answers indicated that a lot has stayed the same for the past four years. While there is not a definitive exit poll to measure how American Jews voted, polls commissioned in 2020 by both Democrats and Republicans found that a vast majority of American Jews supported Joe Biden. Similarly, the 2024 AJC survey found that 61% said they would vote for Biden in the upcoming election; 23% said they would vote for Donald Trump.\n\nThe 2024 AJC survey found that 49% of American Jews believe Biden would be the better choice for preserving the U.S.-Israel relationship, compared to 25% who favor Trump. Likewise, 55% favored a Biden administration when it comes to combating antisemitism versus 20% who think Trump would do a better job.\n\nAJC is a non-partisan organization that neither supports nor endorses candidates for elective offices.\n\n\n\n5. American Jews Need Better Education about Israel\n\nAccording to AJC\u2019s State of Antisemitism in America 2023 Report, eight out of ten American Jews say Israel is important to their Jewish identity, but our 2024 Survey of American Jewish Opinion found that the vast majority of the American Jewish community lacks the education they need about Israel to process this moment in history adequately.\n\nMore than one in five (22%) American Jews said they had received zero formal education about Israel. Those who reported no education about Israel were least likely to say they felt more connected to Israel since 10/7 (35%), followed by those who categorized their education as weak (42%). In contrast, 62% of those who characterized their education about Israel as strong said they felt more connected to the Jewish state since 10/7.\n\nFor educational resources on the current conflict between Israel and Hamas and other valuable resources on Israel, go to AJC.org/IsraelHamasWar.",

        "text": "Iran election: Hardliners dominate presidential candidates\nHardliners dominate Iran presidential candidates\n\nEPA (Clockwise from top left) Saeed Jalili, Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, Masoud Pezeshkian, Mostafa Pourmohammadi, Amirhossein Qazizadeh Hashemi, and Alireza Zakani\n\nIran\u2019s Guardian Council has approved six candidates to run in this month's presidential election. Almost all of them are Islamic hardliners close to the thinking of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The constitutional body vetted the 80 people who registered to stand on 28 June according to their religious and revolutionary credentials. It appears to have approved candidates with a view to setting up hardliners to hold on to the presidency following the death of President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last month.\n\nEPA Saeed Jalili was Iran's chief nuclear negotiator and ran the supreme leader's office\n\nOne front-runner is Saeed Jalili, a former secretary of the Supreme National Security Council and nuclear negotiator who is thought to be the favourite of Ayatollah Khamenei. In his time as head of Iran\u2019s nuclear negotiating team, Mr Jalili repeatedly stonewalled the talks with five world powers while Iran advanced its nuclear programme. He is seen by many as a largely tedious, hard-line Islamist ideologue with no executive experience.\n\nEPA Mohamad Baqer Qalibaf unsuccessfully ran for the presidency in 2005, 2013 and 2017\n\nThe present Speaker of Parliament, Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, is another candidate with a good chance. He is a regime insider and former general of the Revolutionary Guards who has also served as the country\u2019s police chief and mayor of Tehran. One of that pair might decide to leave the race at the last minute in order not to divide the votes. Three other candidates - Tehran Mayor Alireza Zakani, Vice-President Amirhossein Qazizadeh Hashemi and Mostafa Pourmohammadi - are also hardliners of various shades. Mr Pourmohammadi is a former justice and interior minister who, along with Ebrahim Raisi, was a member of the so-called \u201cDeath Committee\u201d that approved the execution of thousands of political prisoners in the late 1980s. An exception to the hardliners is Massoud Pezeshkian, the member of parliament for Tabriz. A relative moderate, he has an outside chance of winning if turnout is very low. Mr Pezeshkian could win the votes of many otherwise reluctant voters who may see a vote of him is a vote against the hardliners. He is also ethnically Azeri, and is thought to have the votes of the some in the north-east of Iran, where the bulk of the population are Turkish-speaking Azeris. Leaving him in the mix might be a ploy to push up a turnout that otherwise could be historically low.\n\nGetty Ex-president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has not been allowed to run",

        "text": "Trump and Biden neck and neck nationally and in battlegrounds \u2014 CBS News poll\nAmong all the factors on voters' minds this election, former President Donald Trump's guilty verdict pales in comparison to issues like the economy, inflation, and the border \u2014 all items on which Trump maintains advantages. As such, the verdict has not dramatically reshaped the race.\n\nBut what we do see is a few more Joe Biden voters activated out of opposition to Trump. His vote has become increasingly centered around anti-Trump sentiment, more so than affinity for Mr. Biden himself. Today, most of Mr. Biden's voters say their main rationale is opposing Trump, and that's up from March.\n\nWhether that dynamic is enough to sustain Mr. Biden looms as one of the central questions of this campaign \u2014 a contest that today is essentially tied in likely voter preference, both nationally and across the collective battleground states.\n\nAmong Trump's voters, the verdict is a wash. A few say it's a reason to show him support, a few say they're backing him despite it, and the great bulk of them say it doesn't matter either way.\n\nA majority say Trump's conviction is not a factor in their vote decision. In fact, the trial ranks much lower as a factor when considered on its own than every other issue tested.\n\nMost of Mr. Biden's voters now say their main rationale is to oppose Trump, not because they like Mr. Biden \u2014 an increase in this rationale since March.\n\n(Mr. Biden capitalized on this kind of sentiment in 2020 too, as substantial numbers expressed it in many battleground states that year.)\n\nMoreover, we see this dynamic again in how people frame their vote decision, along the lines of whether this election is a referendum or a choice.\n\nWhen people say this election is just about their view on Trump, most vote for Mr. Biden.\n\nHowever, when people instead see this race as a judgment just on Mr. Biden, they vote for Trump.\n\nAnd when they're framing it as a comparison between the two, slightly more are voting for Trump than Mr. Biden.\n\nHere's why that direct comparison right now favors Trump:\n\nTrump outpaces Mr. Biden on a range of qualities like being seen as effective, tough, energetic and \u2014 more narrowly \u2014 competent. Also, more think Trump has a vision of where he wants to lead the country.\n\nMr. Biden does better on personal likability and being viewed as compassionate. But that likability gap does not match vote preferences, because a lot of people who dislike Trump personally are voting for Trump anyway.\n\nAnd here's what partially insulates Trump after the trial verdict: so many of his backers, and Republican base, have seen the charges as not serious and the trial as politically motivated.\n\nIn fact, most Republicans believe that the prosecution in New York was brought on not by decisions by New York prosecutors, but at the direction of the Biden administration. Looking forward, if he's elected, that view may have implications for what they'd want Trump to do in turn. Half of Republicans want Trump to get revenge against his political opponents by investigating and bringing criminal charges against them \u2014 a number that rises among MAGA Republicans.\n\nThe border and immigration\n\nThere's broad support for Mr. Biden's recent executive order dealing with the border, including from most Republicans, but despite that, voters who place a high priority on the border are backing Trump by a large margin.\n\nVoters still tend to think migrant crossings will go down more under Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has talked about the actions he would take toward immigration if elected to a second term, including deportation efforts.\n\nA nearly six in 10 majority of voters say they would favor, in principle, a new government program to deport all undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.\n\n(That isn't purely partisan, it includes a third of Democrats. It rises to nine in 10 Republicans.)\n\nA similarly sized majority would have local law enforcement try to identify those living in the U.S. illegally, and just under half support the idea of setting up large government detention centers to sort out which people ought to be deported.\n\nKey voting groups and rationales: Who is backing who?\n\nViews of the national economy are more negative today than they were in March, and voters' financial concerns continue to lead to more Trump support. This, despite positive macro numbers in the jobs report and stock market.\n\nBut inflation \u2014 likely a proxy term for still-high prices \u2014 continues to affect voters.\n\nTrump is up more than 2 to 1 among those who say higher prices have been a hardship. And Trump leads Mr. Biden big among those who say the economy is a major factor in their vote.\n\nMore continue to think they will be financially better off with Trump in office than with Mr. Biden.\n\nNationally, Mr. Biden's support from some key parts of his base have inched up a bit from March, including women. More women now call abortion a major factor in their vote than they did in March and those that do go big for Mr. Biden.\n\nThe president's support among Black voters continues to lag behind his 2020 performance, but it has improved since the spring. More Black voters now say he fights for people like them than said so in March.\n\nMr. Biden has improved a bit with independents compared to our last national poll in early March. (Given that time frame, it's not precisely clear when that shift may have occurred.) That said, there is some anti-Trump sentiment among the independents now backing Mr. Biden. A larger majority of them are doing so now to oppose Trump.\n\nBut Mr. Biden does not have a meaningful advantage among Hispanics, a group he won handily in 2020. More Hispanic voters think they will be financially better off if Trump wins than if Mr. Biden does.\n\nTrump continues to do well with White voters without a college degree and with older voters, groups that backed him in 2016 and 2020. And despite speculation about the \"anti-Trump\" vote in the GOP primaries, more than nine in 10 Republicans are backing Trump, similar to the number of Democrats who are backing Mr. Biden.\n\nMuch of these same patterns play out across the battleground states.\n\nNationally, Republicans have a turnout advantage helping lift Trump, but in the battleground states, Democrats and Republicans are about equally likely to say they'll definitely vote, perhaps due to campaigns trying to activate their voters there.\n\nThis CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,063 U.S. adult residents interviewed between June 5-7, 2024. The data includes an oversample in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. The sample was weighted by gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as past vote. The margin of error is \u00b13.2 points among all adults and \u00b13.8 points among registered voters.\n\nToplines",

        "text": "EU elections: What the European results and far-right surge tells us\nFar right makes gains in EU election but it could struggle to unite\n\nSupporters of the French far-right National Rally party react following their victory\n\nIn Brussels, at past EU leaders\u2019 summits, Emmanuel Macron has at times been accused of trying to steal the limelight.\n\nHe certainly managed that on Sunday night. Although probably not in the way he\u2019d have liked.\n\nAs votes for the European Parliament were still being counted, Mr Macron dominated the headlines.\n\nHis drubbing in the poll by French hard-right nationalists had been expected. His decision to dissolve France\u2019s national parliament as a result, came as a shock.\n\nHe had played with the idea last year, after getting trounced in France\u2019s last general election but few expected this move now.\n\nIt\u2019s a huge gamble. From a position of weakness.\n\nEmmanuel Macron describes himself as a centrist and a passionate European.\n\nThis snap general election, taking place in two rounds on 30 June and 7 July, could result in him having to work alongside a French prime minister from the Eurosceptic far right.\n\nMarine Le Pen, regularly portrayed as his political nemesis, declared on Sunday that her party was ready to govern.\n\nIt\u2019s happened before in France that the president, who is the country\u2019s most powerful politician, and the prime minister, hail from different political parties.\n\nBut if the new prime minister were to come from the far right, that would be a first for France.\n\nMarine Le Pen has worked hard in recent years to try to broaden the appeal of her political movement and to soften its extremist image.\n\nShe and her supporters hope this significant victory at EU level (her National Rally party garnered more than double the number of votes of President Macron\u2019s Renaissance party) will translate into huge wins in the snap election back home.\n\nHer dream would be that those successes would then bring her, or her hugely popular prodigee, the 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, a big stride closer to eventually becoming French president - something she\u2019s attempted and failed to achieve a number of times before. The next presidential vote in France is scheduled for 2027.",

        "text": "Why Robert F. Kennedy\u2019s Jr.'s current presidential polling numbers might not hold up into November\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has reached 15% or more in three approved national polls. One more, and he will have met one of CNN\u2019s benchmarks to qualify for the debate June 27 with Democratic President Joe Biden and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump.\n\nBut Kennedy cannot count on maintaining his current level of support as the November election nears.\n\nIt is pretty common for third-party candidates to look like they have polling momentum in the months before an election, only to come up far short at the ballot box, according to an Associated Press analysis of Gallup data going back to 1980.\n\nThat is not a sign that the polls about Kennedy are wrong right now. They just are not predictors of what will happen in the general election.\n\nStudies have shown that people are bad at predicting their future behavior, and voting is months away. And in a year with two highly unpopular candidates in a rematch from 2020, voters may also use their early support for a third-party candidate to express their frustration with the major party choices. In the end, voters may support the candidate for whom they feel their vote can make a difference or they may decide not to vote at all.\n\nAMERICANS WANT A THIRD PARTY, IN THEORY\n\nThe concept of a third party has been popular for a long time.\n\nA poll conducted by Gallup in 1999 found two-thirds of U.S. adults said they favored a third political party that would run candidates for president, Congress and state offices against Republicans and Democrats. (The AP analysis used Gallup data, when available, because Gallup has a long history of high-quality polling in the United States.)\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nAbout 6 in 10 U.S. adults have said in Gallup polling since 2013 that the Republican and Democratic parties do \u201csuch a poor job representing the American people\u201d that a third major party is needed. In the latest Gallup polling, much of that enthusiasm is carried by independents: 75% say a third party is needed. About 6 in 10 Republicans and slightly fewer than half of Democrats (46%) say an alternative is necessary.\n\nMarjorie Hershey, a professor emeritus in the political science department at Indiana University, said Americans generally like the idea of a third party until specifics emerge, such as that party\u2019s policies and nominees.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a symbolic notion. Do I want more choices? Well, sure. Everybody always wants more choices, more ice cream choices, more fast-food choices,\u201d Hershey said. \u201cBut if you start to get down to brass tacks and you talk about, so would it be tacos or burgers, then that\u2019s an entirely different choice, right?\u201d\n\nTHIRD-PARTY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES RARELY GET A SUBSTANTIAL SHARE OF THE VOTE\n\nThat hypothetical support for third-party candidates often breaks down quickly.\n\nThe AP analysis looked at polling for every independent and minor party presidential candidate who received at least 3% of the popular vote nationally going back to the 1980 election.\n\nIn multiple elections, including the 1980, 1992, and 2016 presidential races, third-party candidates hit early polling numbers that were much higher than their ultimate vote share. For instance, in polls conducted in May and June 1980, between 21% and 24% of registered voters said they would like to see independent candidate John Anderson, a veteran Republican congressman from Illinois, win when he ran for president against Republican Ronald Reagan and Democratic incumbent Jimmy Carter. Anderson went on to earn 7% of the popular vote.\n\nPart of the problem is that early polls often look quite different from the actual general election vote.\n\nVoters \u201cdon\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen between now and the election,\u201d said Jeffrey Jones, a senior editor at Gallup. \u201cThings are going to come up in the campaign that could change the way they think.\u201d\n\nDecades after Anderson, polls conducted during the 2016 presidential campaign put support for Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson, a former New Mexico governor, at between 5% and 12% in polls of registered voters conducted from May to July. That led some people to predict that he could do better than any third-party candidate in decades. Johnson won about 3% of the vote in that election.\n\nJohnson told the AP that he believes his name should have been included in more polls, though he was in surveys used to determine eligibility for debates.\n\nHe also contends that independent candidates struggle to match major party candidates in fundraising.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s money, first and foremost. People don\u2019t donate if they don\u2019t think that you have a possibility of winning,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI\u2019m not excluding myself from that same equation. Look, am I going to give money to somebody that I know is going to lose? I\u2019d rather go on a vacation in Kauai,\u201d Johnson said in an interview while driving with his family on a trip in Hawaii.\n\nKENNEDY\u2019S SUPPORT MAY DROP OFF AS THE ELECTION NEARS\n\nThe American electoral system makes it hard for third parties to thrive. Still, it is possible to have a significant impact without coming close to winning.\n\nBillionaire businessman Ross Perot is among the most successful modern-day examples. He won 19% of the vote when he ran for president in 1992. But that was substantially lower than his support in earlier polling. In polls conducted from May to July of that year, between 30% and 39% of registered voters said they would vote for Perot.\n\nThere are already reasons to believe that at least some of Kennedy\u2019s polling support may be a mirage. (The Kennedy campaign did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nA CNN poll conducted last summer when he was running for the Democratic nomination found that 2 in 10 Democrats who would consider supporting him said that their support was related to the Kennedy name or his family connections. An additional 17% said they did not know enough about him and wanted to learn more, while only 12% said it was because of support for his views and policies.\n\n\u201cA variable that is so different from all these other people is the Kennedy name,\u201d said Barbara Perry, an expert in presidential studies at the University of Virginia\u2019s Miller Center. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of emotion around him that I would say was not there in the Anderson, Perot, (Ralph) Nader and Johnson cases.\u201d\n\nThere also is some evidence that Americans are using support for Kennedy to express frustration with Biden and Trump.\n\nHershey notes that for many people, presidential elections can feel abstract until a few weeks before it happens, so it is good to take early poll numbers with a grain of salt.\n\nSuch polls \u201cdon\u2019t necessarily reflect actual political issues,\u201d Hershey said. \u201cThey reflect general views about life.\u201d",

        "text": "The Least Important Election of a Lifetime\nSign up for The Media Today, CJR\u2019s daily newsletter.\n\nEarly in the morning at the Trial of the Century\u2122, I was standing in line with a few dozen members of the general public, hoping to snag a seat inside the New York City courtroom where Donald Trump faced the first of his many criminal charges. The line was quiet and orderly. A woman close to the front\u2014she\u2019d been here before, she wanted us to know\u2014walked up and down, counting. We heard there was room for around thirty-five people to get in; she tallied forty-eight. There were two young children, an elderly person with a walker. A man in a cowboy hat and fringed leather jacket was holding a yellow legal pad filled with notes. Beside me, a father and son\u2014a sophomore at Stuyvesant High\u2014took some time off from spring break to witness a former president being tried for a crime. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those once-in-a-lifetime things,\u201d the son said. Besides, he added, \u201cwe already live near here.\u201d Farther back was a man who had come to town to see Billy Joel in concert the night before. \u201cI\u2019m a little hungover,\u201d he confided. \u201cHonestly, I thought there\u2019d be more people here.\u201d\n\nIt was strangely quiet. The park next to us, where the week prior a man lit himself on fire in front of dozens of onlookers\u2014he was protesting something completely unrelated to the trial\u2014was virtually empty. Half an hour earlier, I\u2019d watched as three Secret Service agents roused a man who was sleeping on the ground\u2014checking, I suppose, to make sure he wasn\u2019t hiding weapons or explosives under his blanket. He was now slumped on a nearby bench, looking irritated for having been woken up.\n\nWhere the heck was everyone? Six months into 2024, it\u2019s become clear that this will not be an enthusiastic political season\u2014for voters or for the media. Television audiences were steeply down for the primaries, part of what Semafor has called the \u201ccollapsing US political-media-industrial complex.\u201d President Joe Biden faced no meaningful party opposition; so far this year, he has barely campaigned. Trump has made more of a showing but never bothered to participate in a debate with his Republican challengers. Many voters, sensing an inevitable repeat of the cast, themes, and arguments of 2020, have bailed. In April, NBC reported that just 64 percent of registered voters polled said they had a high level of interest in the race, down from 77 percent in 2020. General engagement in the election has hit its lowest point in nearly two decades.\n\nTrump\u2019s first criminal trial\u2014and his eventual conviction on all thirty-four counts\u2014had its moments, including on the day Stormy Daniels, the former porn star, took the stand. But overall, ratings this year have underperformed what news executives are accustomed to in the lead-up to an election. \u201cThe overarching emotion among voters is apathy and even burnout,\u201d said Brian Stelter, the journalist and close observer of the American political and media landscape, who occasionally reported for CNN from outside the courthouse. \u201cWe can see and measure that sense of exhaustion indirectly through all sorts of yardsticks: traffic to news sites, TV ratings, all these data points that suggest the American electorate is fed up and mostly tuned out.\u201d\n\nSix in ten American adults say they are worn out by coverage of the campaign and candidates.\n\nAs time goes on, voters don\u2019t just pay less attention, they see less meaning in major political events. A poll in April found that only 5 percent of Americans consider the siege of the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, to be the most memorable part of Trump\u2019s presidency. (Four percent said it was the pandemic; nearly a quarter of hands raised for the \u201ceconomy,\u201d whatever that means.) When it comes to the cases against Trump\u2014beyond New York, he faces criminal charges in Georgia state court and in US District Court in DC and Florida\u2014polling by the New York Times shows that as the proceedings drag on, voters become less likely to think that Trump did anything so wrong in the first place. \u201cPeople are\u2014forget fatigued, they\u2019ve got their own opinions about it all already,\u201d Steve Krakauer, a longtime TV producer and journalist who now runs Megyn Kelly\u2019s digital show, told me. \u201cThis is a rerun of 2020, so even if you had enormously popular candidates that happened to be running against each other again,\u201d he added, \u201cit\u2019s never as fun as the first time.\u201d\n\nAcross the spectrum, news outlets are feeling the pain, even on specialized shows such as Krakauer\u2019s, with built-in audiences of partisan political junkies. Conservative news websites have seen their audiences plummet; political fractures and dimming philanthropic enthusiasm have challenged sites on the left. \u201cDonald Trump, the Republican nominee for president, is sitting in a courtroom facing felony charges, every day, and everyone\u2019s like\u2026\u2018Eh,\u2019\u201d Jon Favreau, the former speechwriter for Barack Obama, remarked on his podcast, Pod Save America. \u201cThere is something weird going on,\u201d his cohost Dan Pfeiffer replied.\n\nSign up for CJR\u2019s daily email\n\n\u201cThe segments we do on Trump or the election tend to underperform the average segment,\u201d Ryan Grim, The Intercept\u2019s DC bureau chief and cohost of Counter Points, a digital news show, told me. \u201cI think there\u2019s a collective kind of denial going on, like, There\u2019s no way that we have to confront this election again. You can\u2019t possibly be serious.\u201d Grim compared the attitude of his audience to the 2022 Bo Burnham song \u201cJoe Biden,\u201d which includes the incredulous lyric \u201cThey\u2019re really gonna make me vote for Joe Biden?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s perfect,\u201d Grim said. \u201cThere\u2019s zero enthusiasm.\u201d\n\nBack at the line to get into the Trump trial, a court officer arrived, holding small green slips of paper. He handed them to everyone who made the cut, and stopped about a dozen people short of us at the end. \u201cThat\u2019s it for now,\u201d he said, and offered an apologetic smile. From behind, I heard the man from out of town sigh, accepting his fate. \u201cHonestly,\u201d he said, \u201cI really just came to see Billy Joel.\u201d\n\nThe question facing the political press today is whether the public\u2019s apathy is a problem of circumstance\u2014a uniquely disliked set of candidates, a rare presidential rerun\u2014or if something more fundamental, and therefore worrisome, is going on. Surveys show that Americans aren\u2019t just checking out from the election\u2014they\u2019re tuning out all news. In 2016, Pew found that 51 percent of American adults followed the news all or most of the time. By 2022, that was down to 38 percent. The same year, the Knight Foundation reported that Americans\u2019 attention to national news was the lowest it had been since 2018.\n\nThe term for people who shun current events is \u201cnews avoiders,\u201d and their ranks are swelling. The Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, which has tracked people who say they avoid the news, puts the turning point at the arrival of COVID. In 2017, 29 percent of respondents told Reuters that they often or sometimes avoided the news; by last year, it was up to 36 percent. A new Pew report found that about six in ten American adults say they are worn out by coverage of the campaign and candidates. Another Pew study found that some 70 percent of people who avoid the news say that the news just generally wears them down.\n\nBenjamin Toff\u2014a former journalist, now a professor of journalism at the University of Minnesota\u2014has been talking to the news-fatigued for years. In December, he published Avoiding the News with Ruth Palmer and Rasmus Kleis Nielsen, which looks closely at people who avoid the news entirely\u2014as much as 10 percent of the public, by one estimate. If that seems a small segment of society, it\u2019s about the same as the portion of people who say they follow the news avidly\u2014perhaps even more. \u201cThe percentage of people who pay for a digital subscription to The Atlantic or The New Yorker or the New York Times is smaller than the percentage of consistent news avoiders,\u201d Toff told me. \u201cIf the belief is that news is being made for everyone, that\u2019s a distorted notion, because it\u2019s really largely being consumed by a small segment\u2014and a smaller and smaller segment, as we\u2019ve seen\u2014of the public.\u201d The book examines some of the reasons why people avoid the news\u2014they struggle to determine which sources to trust, the information they find doesn\u2019t provide direct answers to their questions, they have trouble evaluating coverage. \u201cThey see it as a source of conflict and tension,\u201d Toff told me. \u201cAnd they see it as irrelevant\u2014a distraction from the things they really care about.\u201d At some point, they check out.\n\n\u201cThe Hidden Tribes of America,\u201d a yearlong study by More in Common, a public interest group focused on uniting the country, calls these people \u201cthe exhausted majority.\u201d Those in the exhausted majority hold political views and economic identities that cut across the spectrum\u2014but all are turned off by the daily drumbeat of political affairs. According to the research, this cohort accounts for roughly two-thirds of the American population. \u201cThe exhausted majority is flexible, forgotten, and frustrated,\u201d Daniel Yudkin, a social psychologist who helps lead research at More in Common, told me. \u201cThey are more likely to want to find common ground, more likely to want to move past divisions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an encroaching edge of exhaustion that\u2019s creeping outward and pulling more and more people into this center group of the jaded.\u201d\n\nYudkin\u2019s research focuses on moral philosophy\u2014how people navigate thorny questions of right and wrong in their everyday lives. (One of his ongoing projects is a four-year study of Reddit\u2019s \u201cAm I the Asshole?\u201d board.) He doesn\u2019t see the exhausted majority as people who don\u2019t care\u2014quite the opposite. They often care a lot about the things that speak to them directly, it\u2019s just that news coverage and political discourse don\u2019t reliably do so. \u201cThings seem to be moving so fast in the political sphere, but for the exhausted majority, it all just feels like people fighting each other\u2014we\u2019re still not making progress on the issues we care about, we still don\u2019t have a politician who is speaking to what we think is important,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re necessarily tuned out. There\u2019s just other issues and topics and questions that people are dealing with.\u201d\n\nToff notes that many people who say they avoid the news actually interact with a lot of it indirectly, through Instagram influencers or family members. On social media, however, algorithms pull you sharply in one direction or another\u2014the filter bubble effect\u2014and deliver you to intense, sometimes horrifying extremes. What you experience online inevitably bleeds into how you perceive mainstream coverage\u2014and other people. A study out of Northwestern University showed that most Americans see themselves as fairly moderate but imagine those on the \u201cother side\u201d to be significantly more extreme and fervent\u2014one of the many things that turns them off following the news. \u201cSurely one might (understandably) think that the main reason people avoid the news must be the news itself, so the solution must be to fix the news,\u201d Toff and his coathors write in Avoiding the News. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nYudkin and More in Common haven\u2019t done a \u201cHidden Tribes\u201d survey of American political engagement in several years, but they hope to give the subject another look in 2025. By then, he expects the ranks of the weary to have grown. \u201cIn my head I\u2019m sort of imagining a creeping border of the exhausted majority,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s an encroaching edge of exhaustion that\u2019s creeping outward and pulling more and more people into this center group of the jaded.\u201d\n\nYudkin recently moved from Brooklyn to New Orleans, where his new neighbors include many of the same people he\u2019s been researching. He doesn\u2019t see them surging back to political news anytime soon. \u201cSome of the things that get people to pay attention to the media are the apocalyptic proclamations about the end of democracy,\u201d Yudkin said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s possible the exhausted majority is becoming less susceptible to these kinds of inflammatory headlines. Like, Eh, this is the tenth time I\u2019ve been told this is unprecedented. This idea of something being unprecedented, especially for the exhausted majority, is falling on deaf ears. They\u2019re over it.\u201d\n\nThe notion that national politics, and the news around it, are disconnected from the needs and experiences of Americans is not so novel. In 1988, when Joan Didion surveyed the landscape of a particularly tedious presidential election season, she pronounced that politics had lost its way in minutiae and closely held plotlines that only the most avid disciple could follow. \u201cWhat strikes one most vividly about such a campaign is precisely its remoteness from the actual life of the country,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe figures are well known, and suggest a national indifference usually construed, by those inside the process, as ignorance, or \u2018apathy,\u2019 in any case a defect not in themselves but in the clay they have been given to mold.\u201d Today, amid a perilous decline in subscribers and patrons, that apathy is, if not harder to disdain, at least more difficult to ignore.\n\nSamantha Ragland, the vice president of journalism programs at the American Press Institute, has devoted her professional life to addressing the problem. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to be hopeless, they don\u2019t want to be anxiety-ridden,\u201d told me. She\u2019s now at work developing strategies to help outlets reach news avoiders. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things happening in life, and we are very much still in a post-pandemic mindset,\u201d she said. \u201cSo horse race coverage, just tracking drama in headlines, all that is really going to support people steering away from news.\u201d Lately, she\u2019s turned her attention away somewhat from social media, and focused more on building personal connections. \u201cWe used to talk about audience engagement, and now we talk about community engagement,\u201d she said. \u201cAudience engagement is about the distribution of resources and assets and reporting you have so that as many people as possible can consume your content. Community engagement is about participating in your community as a member of the community. It\u2019s about looking beyond the numbers to see the faces of your readers.\u201d She talks about reporters getting out \u201cin front of their byline\u201d and making themselves known to readers directly. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how to fill someone\u2019s needs until you know the someone.\u201d\n\nAmy O\u2019Leary has spent much of the past decade thinking about these ideas, too. In a past life, she was an editor at the Times; today, she\u2019s a media consultant living in New Hampshire, where her neighbors and friends in town include people who think the moon landing was faked and hoist upside-down American flags over their woodsheds. (\u201cThe conversations we have are very different than the ones I had in Brooklyn,\u201d she said.) O\u2019Leary spends a lot of time wrestling with the question of what journalism is, or should be. \u201cHow do I want to have impact in the world? Because I really don\u2019t think most of the tools I have are doing it.\u201d She\u2019s drawn to the Brave Little State podcast, from Vermont\u2019s public radio station, which solicits story ideas from members of the community and invites listeners to join in the reporting process. She also admires an Internews project called El Migrante, which interviewed migrants at the southern border and asked them what they wanted to read or hear about their own experiences. \u201cWhen you think about journalism as a service,\u201d she said, \u201cwhat you\u2019re really asking is \u2018What is the point of the news? What is its purpose in society?\u2019 And we have to ask that question in a way that\u2019s a little deeper than previous generations have had to ask it. The increasing distrust of news, the emotional experience of the news, the profound feeling of disempowerment that people have\u2014when you look at all those things, the way we\u2019ve been traditionally delivering the news is not meeting those needs.\u201d\n\nTo that end, last year, the Times updated bylines to provide more detail, including biographical information about reporters. \u201cThe new form allows us to more fully describe the scope of our news gathering,\u201d an announcement read, \u201cemphasizing our role as expert eyewitnesses and thus boosting our credibility.\u201d Some publications have experimented creatively with presentation, translating stories into guides and physical pamphlets that boil down reporting to its most user-friendly essence. Toff and his coauthors provide more suggestions in their book, all aimed at making journalism more inviting and accessible. Crucially, Toff said, journalists need to acknowledge the social context in which people consume news: A voracious news consumer, even when the reporting is grim, may have people in their circle \u201cwho can help them make sense of the news, to work through it together,\u201d he said; the act of discussing press coverage, debating its merits, is bonding. But those who avoid news \u201cdon\u2019t derive any social value from consuming the news,\u201d he continued. He and his colleagues are invested in finding opportunities for them to do so.\n\nLocal outlets may be in the best position to convene audiences for journalism that haven\u2019t yet found their place. A Pew survey released last month shows that nearly all Americans consider local news to be important to their lives\u2014and, notably, they don\u2019t see it as being politically skewed or overly negative. Toff was recently in Odessa, Texas, at a listening session put on by the Texas Tribune, where he was pleasantly surprised to see how people with wildly different viewpoints interacted with one another, at some safe remove from the vitriol of national affairs. \u201cPeople are able to talk civilly to each other in person, even when they disagree, in a way that we assume is impossible,\u201d he said. Recently, Will Lewis, the publisher of the Washington Post, gave a presentation to staff on the paper\u2019s dire financial state (\u201cTo speak candidly: we are in a hole, and we have been for some time,\u201d he said); vowing to repair the situation, he announced a product intended to reach new audiences in the DC metro area, including guides and \u201cexclusive experiences.\u201d\n\nThese endeavors may be painfully earnest; they might not make a difference. \u201cThe problems are pretty deep,\u201d as O\u2019Leary told me, \u201cand I think that most current daily newsrooms are not really reckoning with that.\u201d Still, it\u2019s nice to imagine a version of \u201cnews\u201d that doesn\u2019t immediately conjure up feelings of distress or alienation, a version that feels intimately relevant to the lives of the people who need it, that might even be fun to read. \u201cNews can really help communities reconnect\u2014and we are really in a social-isolation crisis post-COVID,\u201d Ragland said. \u201cOne of the core things that held my generation together is that we wanted to be part of something bigger, and I think we are seeing that collectively now in that communities want to engage in news, but also to engage in the solutions that the news can catalyze.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, we\u2019re stuck with the set pieces that stand in for news during the modern election cycle. A little while after giving up on getting inside the court, I ambled over to Collect Pond Park, which had been designated the legally approved zone for public gatherings and protests. Everything about the setup felt rehearsed: a pen for the pro-Trump folk, another for the protesters, all in easy eyeshot of the pens for the TV correspondents and their crews, clustered on the sidewalk like so many bird droppings.\n\nThere were just a few people milling around in the park, half of them journalists. A reporter from the Times was talking to a Trump backer named Dion Cini, a provocative frequent flier, who was busy unfurling a massive banner that read \u201cTrump or Death.\u201d As he muttered a well-practiced list of talking points (\u201cI don\u2019t mean my death, by the way\u2014I always have to explain this\u201d), he suddenly seemed to realize it was nearing the top of the hour, when the TV correspondents would be delivering their live shots. He whipped around to face the row of cameras. \u201cGet your morning shots!\u201d he yelled, leaning over the railing and pointing at his giant flag. \u201cGet your morning hits in! Get your B-roll!\u201d He knew what they wanted, and he was going to give it to them. The producers turned around and pulled out their phones to capture the moment.\n\nHas America ever needed a media defender more than now?

        "text": "Trust in government hits fresh lows ahead of US presidential election\nNearly two-thirds of Americans do not trust the federal government, a share that has increased over the last two years and marked a period of near record-low confidence in the country\u2019s political institutions.\n\nA Partnership for Public Service poll sampling 800 U.S. adults this spring found just 23% trust the government, compared to 35% in 2022. The results show more Americans consider the federal government to be incompetent, and just 15% believe it to be transparent.\n\n\u201cThe decline in the public\u2019s trust of the federal government \u2014 our most important democratic institution \u2014 is alarming,\u201d said Max Stier, president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, a non-partisan, nonprofit good government organization.\n\nThe federal government distinguishes itself, by its design and function, as a largely apolitical body of millions of workers who carry out policy set by the president or Congress. Federal workers are hired on the basis of their merits, though the upper echelons of cabinet agencies and departments are led by political appointees.\n\nThere are roughly 4,000 appointees serving besides their colleagues in the 2.2 million-large workforce. As early as the 1800s, workers have been legally shielded from cronyism and nepotism, though even the founding fathers recognized a need for government to resemble and serve its people, above all others.\n\nRELATED\n\nDespite these measures intended to preserve a nonpartisan workforce, trust in government has been in decline since the 1960s. Experts worry deepening mistrust could impact voting and engagement, ultimately disincentivizing citizens to engage with and provide feedback to their government altogether.\n\nThis also comes at a time when federal agencies are trying to use modern technology to improve their relationship with constituents through more user-friendly websites, digital filing systems and in-person recruiting. That seems to have made an impact, given about half of respondents said they\u2019re satisfied with their personal interactions with the government.\n\nStill, concerted efforts made by agencies to hire young workers may be stunted by levels of mistrust particularly among those ages 18 to 34. The data shows trust fell from 30% to 15% since 2022.\n\nThe survey also supports findings that Republicans are even less likely to have confidence in their government.\n\nPolicy experts organizations that watch the government and even members of Congress have noted that attacks on the civil service have gained steam in conservative circles. Donald Trump attempted to reclassify thousands of career employees to at-will status, and his campaign supporters and potential vice presidential hopefuls have urged a similar process to take a renewed look at tranches of unelected \u201cbureaucrats.\u201d\n\nRELATED\n\nAlmost two-thirds said there are \u201cmany\u201d civil servants that refuse to cooperate with policies they disagree with, with almost 79% of Republicans affirming that statement compared to 55% of Democrats. Fewer than a quarter said civil servants were nonpartisan.\n\nThough Democrats tend to be more pro-government, a sense of efficacy even among members of this party have declined over the last two years.\n\n\u201cThat progressive system has broken down in our time, and the only real solution is for the national government to do less: to decentralize and privatize as much as possible and then ensure that the remaining bureaucracy is managed effectively along the lines of the enduring principles set out in detail here,\u201d wrote authors of the 2025 Presidential Transition Project, a conservative playbook for the next administration\u2019s leaders organized by the Heritage Foundation.\n\nSurvey results published by the nonpartisan, nonprofit Partnership for Public Service show the public's views of civil servants improve when accounting for work that has sweeping, positive effects on the citizenry. (Screenshot of 2024 Partnership for Public Service Trust in Government survey)\n\nThe Partnership warns that\u2019s the opposite of what the public wants.\n\n\u201cCritically, the American people do not believe that further politicizing the civil service is a good way to improve our government\u2019s ability to deal with national problems,\u201d according to the findings.\n\nFor example, about 75% said they don\u2019t believe a president should be able to fire a civil servant for \u201cany reason,\u201d and 90% said government loses on effectiveness when it\u2019s motivated by politics.\n\nTrust fell even when surveying across racial and ethnic groups, but especially for Hispanic or Latino respondents. This group saw trust in government among members fall to 23% from 45% two years ago.\n\nIn general, there were higher numbers of respondents who felt the government is wasteful, corrupt and inept than there are those who deemed it accountable, useful and attentive to public needs.\n\nMolly Weisner is a staff reporter for Federal Times where she covers labor, policy and contracting pertaining to the government workforce.

        "text": "The presidential primary season is officially over. Here\u2019s what the results could mean for November\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The presidential primary calendar has officially come to an end with weekend victories for Democratic President Joe Biden in Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nBoth Biden and Republican Donald Trump already clinched their party nominations in March, setting up a historic general election rematch between the current and former president.\n\nMany Americans did not want a 2020 rematch, according to public opinion polls, and both Biden and Trump are broadly unpopular. But the two lost just three contests total out of more than a hundred, a reflection of how the Democratic and Republican bases stood by Biden and Trump despite both facing significant political challenges \u2014 and in Trump\u2019s case, four criminal indictments, one of which led to felony convictions.\n\nBoth Biden and Trump did face protest votes. While those votes did not come close to changing the primary results, they offer insight into the November general election rematch and are already shaping both campaigns\u2019 strategies against each other.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nEasy wins for the Democratic incumbent\n\nBiden won the Democratic caucuses in Guam and the Virgin Islands on Saturday. He received 467 out of 469 votes cast in the Virgin Islands caucuses, earning him all seven delegates at stake. Self-help author Marianne Williamson and \u201cUncommitted\u201d each received one vote, according to local Democratic Party officials.\n\nEarlier in the day, the president also swept all seven delegates available in Guam. Voters there did not cast ballots directly for presidential candidates but instead elected individuals to serve as national convention delegates, all of whom are pledged to support Biden.\n\nThe contests marked Biden\u2019s 53rd and 54th wins of the primary campaign. His only defeat came at the hands of relatively unknown candidate Jason Palmer in the American Samoa caucuses, where only 91 total votes were cast.\n\nBiden\u2019s journey to reclaiming the Democratic nomination began in 2022, when he proposed bumping Iowa and New Hampshire from their traditional first-in-the-nation voting slots in favor of South Carolina, which played a pivotal role in reviving his 2020 campaign. The Democratic National Committee adopted the new plan, but New Hampshire balked at the demotion and scheduled its primary for 11 days before South Carolina. Biden then opted to skip New Hampshire\u2019s primary, rather than violate the new party rules that he had championed. Instead, his supporters in the state mounted a successful write-in campaign on his behalf, sparing the incumbent president the possible embarrassment of starting the year with a loss in a contest that he had barred himself from competing in.\n\nAfter Robert F. Kennedy Jr. abandoned his short-lived Democratic primary campaign in favor of a third-party run in the general election, Biden did not face major primary challenges from Williamson, Palmer, U.S. Rep. Dean Phillips or any of the other handful of Democrats appearing on ballots across the country.\n\nA robust GOP field fails to stop Trump\n\nThe Republican presidential primary season concluded on June 4, as the local parties in Guam and the Virgin Islands held their GOP events earlier in the year. Trump prevailed in all but two contests in 2024 \u2013 the primaries in Washington, D.C., and Vermont, which both went for former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley.\n\nTrump began his campaign to return to the White House in mid-November 2022, when many Republicans blamed him for the party\u2019s poor showing in the midterm elections just days before. Since then, Republican voters largely rallied behind the former president following his indictments in four federal and state criminal investigations, with most of his rivals for the presidential nomination reluctant to criticize him for much of the year.\n\nIn January, he scored his first big win in the Iowa caucuses, which remained first in the GOP pecking order, followed by another in the New Hampshire primary, where Haley had hoped moderate Republicans and independents would propel her to an upset victory. Trump also scored a symbolic win in a non-binding \u201cbeauty contest\u201d primary in Nevada, where he didn\u2019t appear on the ballot, but his supporters backed the \u201cNone of these candidates\u201d ballot option over Haley.\n\nHaley was Trump\u2019s last major primary challenger remaining when she suspended her campaign after a disappointing showing on Super Tuesday. Others who ran against Trump included Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, U.S. Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and Mike Pence, the former vice president.\n\nThe meaning of the protest votes\n\nBiden\u2019s chief rival in the primaries came in the form of organized campaigns in several states to vote for \u201cUncommitted\u201d to protest his support of Israel in the Israel-Hamas War.\n\nAcross 24 states and Washington, D.C., variations of \u201cUncommitted\u201d received more than 793,000 votes. In terms of raw votes, the campaign reached its high-water mark in Michigan with nearly 102,000 voters choosing that option. The highest share of the vote \u201cUncommitted\u201d received was in Hawaii with 29%, although that amounted to only 463 votes cast. The campaign persisted through the end of the calendar, with \u201cUncommitted\u201d receiving between 8% and 10% of the vote in the final four Democratic presidential primaries of the year where it appeared on the ballot.\n\nAfter becoming the presumptive nominee, Trump faced a seeming protest vote of his own in the form of votes for Haley. In the 21 contests held since Haley withdrew from the race, she still received more than 1.3 million votes. She received more than 20% of the vote as a non-candidate in Maryland and Indiana and more than 15% of the vote in Washington State, Nebraska, Arizona, Pennsylvania and Kansas. In addition, just shy of 49,000 voters in seven states cast their ballots for some form of \u201cUncommitted.\u201d\n\nOne immediate takeaway from these primary protest votes is that both campaigns have now begun efforts to try to woo voters dissatisfied with the other candidate and bring them into the fold. The Trump campaign, for example, has made appeals to Arab Americans in Michigan, while the Biden campaign is launching an effort to reach out to moderate Republicans.",

        "text": "U.S. Automobile Dealer Sentiment Index: As Market Uncertainty Grows, Dealers Remain Pessimistic and Cautious\nATLANTA, June 10, 2024 \u2013 The latest Cox Automotive Dealer Sentiment Index (CADSI) remained stable from Q1 to Q2 2024 despite dealer uncertainty in the market and economy. The Q2 current market index score of 42 indicates most U.S. auto dealers see the market as weak. One year ago, the index was 45, also below the 50 threshold. The last time current market sentiment was above 50 \u2013 suggesting the market was strong, not weak \u2013 was Q2 2022.\n\nTypically, the second quarter shows a decline in market expectations for the next three months, and Q2 2024 is no different. The market outlook index dropped from 51 in Q1 to 44, showing more dealers expect a weak market ahead. The downward trend is influenced by a weaker-than-normal tax refund season and ongoing political and economic uncertainty, leading to a cautious dealer outlook.\n\nCox Automotive Chief Economist Jonathan Smoke noted, \u201cThere is a lot of uncertainty in this market, leaving consumers and dealers alike unsure of the road ahead. On top of uncertainty about interest rates, we are heading into an election season, and this one is especially breeding more concern. In the auto business, uncertainty is the enemy \u2013 it negatively impacts sales, hurts consumer sentiment, and leaves auto dealers feeling troubled.\u201d\n\nDespite the market\u2019s perceived weakness, the CADSI showed some promising signs in Q2. The profit index, for example, increased for the first time since Q3 2021. While still below the 50 threshold at 36, profit perceptions have stabilized. Additionally, both online and in-person customer traffic improved from Q1, with franchised and independent dealers reporting higher consumer traffic sentiment, though it remains weak.\n\n\u201cOverall, dealer sentiment is likely worse than actual market conditions,\u201d added Smoke. \u201cWhile profits are down from all-time highs, we still believe the dealer business is healthy. Retail vehicle sales have been fairly consistent so far this year, inventory has returned to reasonable levels, and we believe interest rates have likely hit a ceiling. With a good job market, the market is not collapsing, and we believe weak current market sentiment is more about uncertainty than actual performance.\u201d\n\nCosts and Price Pressure Continue to Rise\n\nWhile market uncertainty may be hard to describe accurately, one reality that is not hard to quantify is rising costs. The cost index in Q2 is at a record high, matching the peak in Q2 2022. Both franchised and independent dealers agree that costs are increasing. The elevated cost index has persisted for more than two years. Similarly, price pressure is down slightly from Q1 but remains high with an index score of 65, up from 58 a year ago. This indicates that dealers feel pressure to lower prices while still facing challenges in offering the value consumers expect, as incentives remain below 2018 and 2019 levels.\n\nImproving Sales and Inventory\n\nThe new-vehicle sales index improved for the second straight quarter with a Q2 reading of 53, indicating a positive market perception despite being lower than last year\u2019s 58. Still, a score above 50 suggests that more dealers view the new-vehicle sales market as strong rather than weak.\n\nNew-vehicle inventory levels are also seen as growing, with a Q2 index of 69, down from a peak of 75 in Q1 but still higher than last year\u2019s 60. This index score of 69 is the second-highest ever, indicating that a majority of dealers perceive their inventory as growing.\n\nOn the incentive front, the Q2 index rose to 34 from 28 a year ago, though it remains below pre-pandemic norms. With moderate incentives since 2021, dealers consistently describe their current OEM new-vehicle incentives as small.\n\nConversely, the used-vehicle sales index remains under the 50 threshold, indicating a weak market. Despite rising for the second straight quarter and reaching 42, matching last year\u2019s score, the index score in Q2 was among the worst recorded since the index launched in 2018.\n\nThe used-vehicle inventory index declined in Q2, which is not uncommon for the spring survey. The index score of 42, while lower than Q1, is still higher than one year ago. However, it does suggest that dealers perceive used-vehicle inventory as declining rather than growing.\n\nFranchised dealers, as is common in the quarterly survey, have a more positive view of the used-vehicle market than independent dealers. In Q2, the franchised dealers\u2019 index score was 54 (one point higher than the new-vehicle market index), suggesting that they see the market as strong. On the other hand, independent dealers scored the current used-vehicle market at 38 \u2013 an improvement from last year and last quarter \u2013 but still indicating that a majority of independent dealers perceive the used-vehicle market as weak.\n\nElectric Vehicle Sales Sentiment Remains Weak\n\nSentiment about electric vehicle (EV) sales fell to a new low in Q2. When asked about how EV sales compare to one year ago, the index score came in at 41, down from 42 in Q1. A score below 50 indicates that a majority of dealers describe EV sales as worse now than one year ago. The index has fallen each quarter since Q2 2023, when the score was 52.\n\nExpectations for the EV market in the future improved in Q2, increasing from 36 to 39. Still, the index score of 39 suggests that most dealers think the EV market will be declining, not growing, three months from now. On the positive side, a majority of dealers (with an index score of 57) see the existing tax credits as having a positive impact on EV sales.\n\nThe Clouds of a Coming Election\n\nWhen asked about factors holding back their business, auto dealers in Q2 focused on Interest Rates, the Economy, and Market Conditions, respectively, with minimal change from Q1 and one year ago. However, as the U.S. presidential election in November approaches, Political Climate continues to increase as a factor impacting business. In fact, while concerns about Interest Rates have come down slightly quarter over quarter, concerns over the Political Climate have increased. In the latest survey, 36% of dealers cite the Political Climate as a factor holding back business, up from 33% in Q1 and 29% one year ago. The Economy and Market Conditions also slightly increased quarter over quarter in Q2.\n\nSmoke commented, \u201cIn many ways, the Political Climate is a surrogate for \u2018uncertainty.\u2019 Many dealers and consumers believe the election outcome will impact the economy and the auto market in some way \u2013 either good or bad \u2013 and that expectation of change is causing paralysis in the market and hurting sentiment.\u201d\n\nMore than independents, franchised dealers feel that Political Climate is holding back business, at 41%, and it is now ranked No. 3 on the list of top 10 factors affecting business. Independent dealers are more concerned about Expenses (No. 4) and Credit Availability (No. 5). For independent dealers, Political Climate ranks No. 6, at 34%, up one percentage point from Q1.\n\nLimited Inventory, the top factor holding back business two years ago, has dropped to No. 7 among all dealers, at 29%. For franchised dealers, Limited Inventory dropped to No. 9, while independent dealers still place it in the No. 7 spot.\n\nTop Factors Holding Back Business Among All Dealers\n\nTop Factors Overall Rank Q2 2024 Percentage Q2 2023 Percentage Interest Rates 1 59% 53% Economy 2 57% 55% Market Conditions 3 41% 42% Political Climate 4 36% 29% Expenses 5 31% 30% Credit Availability for Consumers 6 31% 30% Limited Inventory 7 29% 44% Consumer Confidence 8 28% 26% Competition 9 15% 12% Regulation 10 8% 7%\n\nViews of the U.S. economy in the latest survey remained mostly unchanged quarter over quarter and year over year. With an index score of 41, a majority of dealers see the U.S. economy as weak, not strong. The index is down one point from last quarter and down from 44 in Q2 2023. Franchised dealers\u2019 view of the economy, at 46, has been consistent for three consecutive quarters. Independent dealers had a score of 40 in the latest report, unchanged from last quarter.\n\nCox Automotive Dealer Sentiment Index Methodology\n\nDerived from a quarterly survey that Cox Automotive issues to a representative sample of franchised and independent auto dealers from around the country, the Dealer Sentiment Index measures dealer perceptions of current retail auto sales and sales expectations for the next three months as \u201cstrong,\u201d \u201caverage,\u201d or \u201cweak.\u201d The survey also asks dealers to rate new-car sales and used-car sales separately, along with various key drivers, including consumer traffic. Responses are used to calculate an index by which any number over 50 indicates that more dealers view conditions as strong rather than weak. The Q2 2024 CADSI is based on 1,026 U.S. auto dealer respondents, comprising 550 franchised dealers and 476 independents. The survey was conducted from April 23 to May 7, 2024.\n\nDealer responses were weighted by dealership type and sales volume to represent the national dealer population. For each aspect of the market surveyed, respondents are given an option related to strong/increasing, average/stable, or weak/decreasing, along with a \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d opt-out. Indices are calculated by creating a mean score in which:\n\nStrong/increasing answers are assigned a value of 100.\n\nAverage/stable answers are assigned a value of 50.\n\nWeak/declining selections are assigned a value of 0.\n\nRespondents who select \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d at a particular question are removed from the related index calculation. The total metrics reported have a +/- 3.06% margin of error.\n\nAbout Cox Automotive\n\nCox Automotive is the world\u2019s largest automotive services and technology provider.

        "text": "What\u2019s Next for U.S. Immigration Policy on the Southern Border?\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they\u2019re published.\n\nLast week, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to curb immigration, effectively blocking most asylum claims when border crossings spike to a certain level. The move comes amid mounting concerns from across the political spectrum over immigration, which has emerged as a major voter issue this election year.\n\nSome Democrats and human rights advocates have warned the Biden administration that the executive order could exacerbate the humanitarian crisis at the border, putting immigrants at greater risk as they wait on the Mexican side of the border. A recent analysis by ProPublica and The Texas Tribune found lawmakers, advocates and government officials previously issued similar warnings that went unheeded before a fire in a Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, detention center killed 40 men in March 2023.\n\nTwo weeks before the fire, which was one of the deadliest incidents involving immigrants in Mexico\u2019s history, the Congressional Research Service published a report saying that the Mexican government did not have adequate resources to handle the influx of U.S.-bound migrants. \u201cAs a result, migrants remain vulnerable to crime and other abuses,\u201d the report concluded.\n\nThe ProPublica and Tribune examination, which was accompanied by an 18-minute documentary titled \u201cThe Right Way,\u201d unpacks the deadly consequences of policies such as Title 42, an emergency health code used by former President Donald Trump to slow immigration and continued under Biden. Even though the pandemic-era policy, which enabled the quick expulsion of 2.8 million immigrants, ended in May 2023, migrants continued to be stranded in Mexican cities because of other U.S. policies.\n\nThe week before Biden\u2019s executive order, ProPublica and the Tribune hosted a virtual panel with experts to discuss U.S. policies that contributed to the fire, changes to the U.S. asylum system and why immigration has become a leading concern among voters as they prepare for this year\u2019s presidential election. Speakers included:\n\nAndrew Selee , president of the Migration Policy Institute\n\n, president of the Migration Policy Institute Maureen Meyer , vice president for programs at the Washington Office on Latin America\n\n, vice president for programs at the Washington Office on Latin America Victor Manjarrez , director of the Center for Law and Human Behavior at the University of Texas at El Paso and a former chief patrol agent for the U.S. Border Patrol\n\n, director of the Center for Law and Human Behavior at the University of Texas at El Paso and a former chief patrol agent for the U.S. Border Patrol Perla Trevizo, reporter for the ProPublica-Texas Tribune investigative unit\n\nBelow are excerpts from the panel\u2019s discussion, which have been edited for clarity and concision.\n\nPerla Trevizo: We\u2019ve been hearing a lot about a crisis \u2014 Biden\u2019s crisis, the border crisis. Is there really a crisis, and what do we mean by that?\n\nAndrew Selee: The American public overwhelmingly thinks it\u2019s a crisis. At least four polls that came out recently tell the same story, which is that Americans are quite pro-immigration, but they\u2019re also really worried about the border. This cuts across party lines now. Yes, Republicans are more concerned about the border than Democrats, but Democrats have moved on this issue as have independents.\n\nWhen you have a system that can\u2019t make decisions about who should come into the country, that undermines the credibility of your immigration system. It makes people more worried about immigration in general and less willing to support things like legal pathways that would actually help.\n\nWe don\u2019t have a crisis in terms of our well-being as a society, but we do have a crisis in terms of being able to make decisions about who comes in and keep some sort of control over immigration policy. I\u2019m worried if we don\u2019t figure this part out, we\u2019re going to see a backlash against immigration that will hurt all of us.\n\nMaureen Meyer: As the administration looks to reduce numbers at the border so that it doesn\u2019t seem like a crisis, what you end up having is a humanitarian crisis on the Mexican side of the border. As numbers have dropped here, especially since last December, Mexico is encountering over 120,000 migrants a month. So what you have is a crisis that you\u2019re exporting farther south.\n\nTrevizo: We\u2019ve recently seen a significant drop in border apprehensions or encounters, which is not common for this time of the year. We\u2019re hearing a lot about numbers going up or down and Mexico\u2019s role in it. What do these numbers tell us?\n\nVictor Manjarrez: Normally, I would say that that\u2019s pretty significant, but that 50% drop is compared to December, when we had historically large numbers in terms of arrests along the southwest border.\n\nEven with that drop, it\u2019s estimated that there is going to be between 1.6 to 1.7 million arrests. The high-water mark was 1.6 million in 2000 for the longest time. When the numbers went up in 2022 and 2023 to 2.2 million, it was crushing because it does a number of things. You have to collapse your operations, and you have to vacate areas to handle the flows that come in.\n\nThe dynamic used to be that most people try to evade early detection. Now, people surrender to claim asylum. That doesn\u2019t take away from the fact that it takes a large number of resources, from transportation to the logistics of processing.\n\nWatch the Panel Discussion\n\nTrevizo: What would a more orderly process look like?\n\nSelee: I think you want three elements. You want people to be able to come on legal pathways to take available jobs. Right now, we have 8 to 10 million jobs a month that are open, and it\u2019s a very tight labor market. You want a way of connecting employers with willing workers. We don\u2019t have that right now. We have a system built in 1990 that has numbers set in stone by Congress 34 years ago in a different economy. That\u2019s one element you have to update.\n\nSecondly, you need a refugee system where people who are fleeing things that would put their lives in danger can get into the United States through asylum, either by applying at the border or ideally earlier. Ideally, we want a humanitarian protection system that starts in the region, particularly since we know most people are coming from somewhere in Latin America and the Caribbean, but then has a fail-safe at the border.\n\nYou have to be able to return people who don\u2019t meet those two characteristics: who aren\u2019t coming on a legal pathway and aren\u2019t granted asylum. You have to make decisions on protection fairly quickly, by the way. If it takes four or five years, which is what it takes right now to get a decision, you\u2019re not giving protection to people who need it. But you\u2019re also creating a pull factor for people who might not have otherwise applied for protection. We don\u2019t tend to remove a lot of people who\u2019ve been in the country that long. People know that if they make it to the U.S. border, they are likely to get in.\n\nThat\u2019s a system that doesn\u2019t make sense for people who need protection, but it also doesn\u2019t make sense from a migration protection standpoint. We then turn to Mexico and other countries along the way and say, let\u2019s make it harder for people to get here. We would be much better off with a system that gave protection that had legal pathways but also returned people who don\u2019t come through those ways. But we\u2019ve ended up with a system that simply tries to slow people down.\n\nTrevizo: When you talk to the administration or when you hear Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas talk, they do point to legal pathways: the CBP One App, humanitarian parole, more guest worker visas. The administration was moving in that direction, but we\u2019re still seeing record numbers. What happened?\n\nSelee: They\u2019ve really stretched the limits of what they can do with the executive branch to create legal pathways. They\u2019ve tried to increase employer interest. They created quite a large pathway for Cubans, Haitians, Venezuelans and Nicaraguans, groups of people where there are displacement crises. It made sense to stretch what they call humanitarian parole powers to allow people to enter the country and have a work permit for two years. They\u2019ve tried to speed up asylum and create incentives for people to go to ports of entry to apply for asylum rather than going between ports of entry. But without resources, without authorities, without Congress, it\u2019s hard to create legal pathways. Unless Congress gets involved, appropriates money and provides some authorities, particularly on the legal pathway side, it becomes very hard to get done.\n\nWe saw an attempt by Republicans and Democrats, but that fell apart so we\u2019re back to where we were\n\nTrevizo: The Senate recently revived a failed immigration bill, but once again, Congress tanked the bill. If it had passed, what would it have done?\n\nSelee: It would have codified some of the things they did to restrict asylum. For decisions on asylum, it would\u2019ve put more money into the Border Patrol and into ICE, for processing people and for returns. It\u2019s a Band-Aid, but sometimes Band-Aids are important too. It would have at least created a more virtuous cycle for people who have strong asylum claims to present themselves at the border and a disincentive for people who know they don\u2019t have strong claims.\n\nOn the flip side, Mexico came out for the first time ever with a national strategy on migration. How does Mexico relate to its own diaspora, i.e., the 12 million Mexicans that live in the U.S.? How does Mexico deal with asylum-seekers? Like with the U.S., it\u2019s a question of resources and authorities and how you actually do it.\n\nTrevizo: Immigration is a top issue for voters. On the one hand, Biden has tightened his position on immigration. On the other hand, you have Trump saying that he would call for mass deportations. Heading into November, what do you expect to see around immigration?\n\nMeyer: In terms of the Biden administration, we will continue to see a harder-line policy. President Biden and Mexico President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador spoke a few weeks ago and talked about how they\u2019re going to increase enforcement to reduce the number of migrants reaching the borders.\n\nIf it is a Biden second term, we will hopefully see a shift back to expanding legal pathways, improving the system, adding more resources and a continuation of these programs, especially the regional programs.\n\nWith Trump\u2019s first term, we saw canceling refugee resettlement numbers or dramatically lowering them, canceling programs that Biden restarted like the Central America\u2019s Minors Program, building more wall and, as you said, increased mass deportation. It\u2019s a very contrasting view of the situation at the border that will have stark differences come January 2025.",

        "text": "Moldova\u2019s Fate Is Tied to Ukraine\u2019s: Now Is the Time for the West to \u201cGo Big\u201d on Moldova\nWill President Sandu Win Reelection This Fall?\n\nMoldova is set to hold presidential elections on October 20, 2024. There are reasons to be cautiously optimistic about Sandu\u2019s chances of reelection: the president\u2019s approval rating reportedly increased from 40 percent in 2022 to 46 percent in 2023, and current polls put her ahead of the opposition candidate Igor Dodon, the leader of the pro-Russian Party of Socialists. At the same time, the electoral margins appear worryingly thin compared with 2020. A December 2023 poll shows Sandu leading the presidential race 30 percent to 24 percent over Dodon, who has gained 8 percentage points since September. Yet although she is projected to win the first round, Sandu is projected to lose the second\u2014not only to Dodon (35 percent to 46 percent) but also to the next-highest-ranking opposition candidate, Ion Ceban (34 percent to 42 percent).\n\nThe situation is especially precarious in light of Russia\u2019s disruption of previous elections and the uncovering of a Kremlin-backed coup plot in early 2023. The stakes of this election virtually guarantee Russian destabilization efforts, either to rig the results in Dodon\u2019s favor or, in the case of a PAS victory, to discredit the electoral outcome. Moldovan authorities and independent media investigators have exposed the extent of Russia\u2019s interference campaign, which includes cyberattacks, weaponized disinformation, and Russian-sponsored public protests. The \u201cunprecedented levels of Russian interference\u201d in Moldova\u2019s recent local elections can be considered a test run for larger-scale disruption efforts this fall. The information war within Moldova ultimately favors Russia, not Moldova. Since the country\u2019s independence, Moldovan institutions have been weak\u2014victims of Russian undermining, plundering by oligarchs, and the brain drain of mass emigration. These challenges have weakened the pro-reform government\u2019s ability to counter malign narratives. This difficulty is compounded by the fact that many of Moldova\u2019s native Russian speakers look to Russian sources for their news. Even though the Kremlin-backed news channels were banned in Moldova in mid-2022, the replacement of these networks with more balanced Russian-language programming has been slow.\n\nWill Moldova\u2019s Economic Opening with the European Union and Reform Agenda Continue to Progress?\n\nOther than the outcome of the upcoming presidential election, Moldova\u2019s near-term future hinges on its ongoing economic opening with the European Union and its ability to execute the requisite reforms that will keep the country on track for EU accession. By all accounts, Moldova\u2019s progress toward European integration is the one area in which Sandu and the PAS have seen \u201cunmitigated success,\u201d but the slow pace of institutional reforms has left the public agitated. The high hopes that followed the PAS\u2019s initial victory have now been offset by several years of turbulence. Since 2020, Moldovan society has been rocked by the Covid-19 pandemic, an energy crisis, an influx of Ukrainian refugees, supply chain disruptions, and the loss of traditional markets. Taken together, these challenges have overshadowed the government\u2019s comparatively subtle steps toward long-term development. Like Ukraine, Moldova\u2019s path to EU membership is steep, requiring major administrative, political, judicial, and economic reforms, as well as the alignment of domestic laws and standards with those of the European Union. These major structural changes will take time to crystallize; as growing pains test public patience and put pressure on Sandu, the country\u2019s visible rapprochement with the European Union has become her strongest source of political capital. Sandu\u2019s pledge to make Moldova \u201ca full member of the European family by 2030\u201d appears more in reach than ever: although Moldova remains in an \u201cearly stage\u201d of the reform process, the European Commission\u2019s approval of the country\u2019s liberal trajectory prompted the European Council to open formal accession negotiations with both Moldova and Ukraine on December 14, 2023.\n\nIf domestic reforms and deeper economic engagement with Europe continue to move forward without further disruptions, Moldova\u2019s entry into the European Union by 2030 might be possible. Russian subversion efforts have not managed to dim public support for the bloc: recent polls conducted by the International Republican Institute (IRI) found that 63 percent of Moldova\u2019s population pins the country\u2019s future on EU membership, and 67 percent ranks the European Union as Moldova\u2019s most important economic partner. Forty-two percent of adults also believe that Moldova is moving in the right direction\u2014a 14-point increase from IRI\u2019s 2022 poll and the highest it has been in nearly a decade. Given the divisions within Moldovan society and the volatility of its political landscape, Sandu has moved to capitalize on favorable winds by announcing a referendum on EU accession this November. By focusing the government\u2019s efforts on her most popular issue, Sandu is more likely to assuage those whose support for EU integration outweighs any current dissatisfaction with the PAS. One of the reasons that polling on EU membership is higher than PAS favorability is the fact that many Russian speakers, including some of Transnistria\u2019s leaders and business elite, stand to benefit from European integration and are supportive of deeper EU-Moldovan relations. In light of Moldovan ambivalence toward Russia and the risks of a pro-Russian backlash, the European Union can support Moldova\u2019s trajectory by prioritizing accession talks, extending support for ongoing reforms, and making additional efforts to strengthen EU-Moldovan trade, thereby offering the population a preview of the advantages of EU membership.\n\nWill Moldova Handle a Slow-Motion Energy Crisis Coming in December 2024?\n\nUntil recently, Moldova sourced 100 percent of its energy from Russian gas delivered through Ukraine to Transnistria, the site of the country\u2019s only power plant. Although Transnistria received the gas for free, with associated revenues constituting the bulk of the region\u2019s income, Russia billed the Moldovan government for the costs. This arrangement gave Russia an annual opportunity to strong-arm Moldova for concessions by dangling the threat of price hikes and throttled gas supplies. The unbundling of Moldova\u2019s energy sector became a top government priority after the invasion of Ukraine, which plunged Moldova into its worst energy crisis since its independence. Last fall, the government broke Moldova\u2019s dependence on Russian gas by drawing on a pipeline running through Romania, and it also conducted an audit that disproved the country\u2019s debt to Russian energy giant Gazprom.\n\nThese efforts have dashed Russia\u2019s \u201cgas blackmail\u201d in all but one area: 70 percent of Moldova\u2019s electricity still comes from the Russian gas-powered plant in Transnistria. While the path toward long-term energy independence\u2014including the development of renewable energy alternatives\u2014will take time, more immediate efforts can be made to accelerate Moldova\u2019s integration into the European energy grid through projects such as the EU-backed construction of new electric transmission lines between Moldova and Romania. Current initiatives will need to accelerate before the year\u2019s end: Russia\u2019s contract with Ukraine to transport gas via pipelines in Ukrainian territory will expire on December 31, 2024, and failure to replace it could trigger a second energy crisis and mass emigration. Furthermore, because Transnistria will no longer be receiving heavily subsidized Russian gas, the potential collapse of the region\u2019s economy risks leaving Moldova with another refugee crisis that it is ill equipped to handle, as Transnistria\u2019s residents pour over the banks of the Nistru river in search of opportunities. The international community must make every effort to ensure the operability of new electricity networks, help Romania increase its electricity production, and support Moldova\u2019s own domestic capacity. This planning and negotiation must include Transnistria, both in negotiation with Transnistrian leaders to continue using the region\u2019s electrical plant with gas supplied from non-Russian sources and in ensuring that there is a plan to help support the Transnistrian economy.\n\nConclusion\n\nWestern investments in both Ukraine and Moldova over the next several months have an enormous potential for return\u2014a democratic and prosperous Moldova supports a free and open Eastern Europe, and Moldova\u2019s pro-Western government offers a strategic opportunity to usher a country deprived of democracy into the European fold and create a template for good governance in the region. The end state for Moldova is a flourishing democracy with a strong GDP, resilient institutions, energy independence, full EU membership, and the protection of regional security partnerships with Romania and Ukraine.\n\nDaniel F.

        "text": "When and where will the DNC and RNC be held this year?\nWith just over four months until the general election on Nov. 5, the presidential election cycle is in full swing. Both Democrats and Republicans are turning their attention to the Midwest to gear up for their respective parties\u2019 national political conventions, which will officially nominate and confirm a candidate for U.S. president and vice president.\n\nHere\u2019s what to know about this year\u2019s Democratic and Republican national conventions.\n\nElection 2024:Donald Trump and Joe Biden are nearly tied nationally and in battleground states, new poll says\n\nWhen and where will the conventions be held this year?\n\nThe Republicans kick off the convention season in Milwaukee from July 15-18. Not only is Wisconsin a battleground state\u2014President Joe Biden won by a narrow margin of 20,000 votes\u2014but it gives the city another chance to host after the Democratic convention in 2020, which was stymied due to a surge in COVID-19 cases throughout the U.S. in 2019.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nOver 50,000 people, including approximately 2500 delegates, will attend the four-day event in southeastern Wisconsin.\n\nA month later, the DNC will hold its convention in Chicago from August 19 to 22, just 90 miles south of Milwaukee. The city has a storied history of hosting conventions on both sides of the political aisle, going back to 1860 with the nomination of Abraham Lincoln. According to the Chicago Sun-Times, this will be the Windy City\u2019s 26th political convention.\n\nWhat happens at the DNC and RNC?\n\nIn addition to adopting and unifying a comprehensive party platform, the Democratic National Committee and Republican National Committee, respectively, offer their parties a chance to select their presidential and vice presidential candidates officially. Delegates from each state and U.S. territory will vote based on their primary election results.\n\nSince 1832, the Democratic Party has held a national convention every four years to nominate its chosen candidates. The Republican National Convention also has a long history; the first convention was held in 1856 to select a presidential and vice-presidential candidate.\n\nPrep for the polls:See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nWhere can I find more information?\n\nEach party will post updates on their convention websites.

        "text": "WATCH: Trump holds rally in Las Vegas after week of record high temperatures in region\nLAS VEGAS (AP) \u2014 Former President Donald Trump rallied voters in the scorching heat of Las Vegas, at points telling his supporters to ask for help if needed and appearing irritable with the teleprompters that he said were not working.\n\nWatch the fully rally in the player above.\n\nThe presumptive GOP nominee\u2019s campaign hired extra medics, loading up on fans and water bottles and allowed supporters to carry umbrellas to an outdoor rally Sunday in Las Vegas, where temperatures exceeded 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius). The Clark County Fire Department said most of the medical calls were related to the heat, and six people were sent to a hospital and 24 others were treated on site.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want anybody going on me. We need every voter. I don\u2019t care about you. I just want your vote,\u201d he said, adding that he was joking.\n\nEarlier in his speech, he said the campaign would offer help to people who were feeling tired and joked that \u201ceverybody,\u201d including the U.S. Secret Service, was worried about the safety of the crowds and not about him.\n\nWATCH: Who\u2019s on Trump\u2019s running mate shortlist and what his decision will tell us\n\n\u201cThey never mentioned me. I\u2019m up here sweating like a dog,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is hard work.\u201d\n\nTrump returned to Nevada, one of the top battleground states in the November election, for his second rally since he was found guilty in a hush-money scandal.\n\nThe unprecedented conviction of a former president has juiced Trump\u2019s fundraising and galvanized his supporters, but it remains to be seen whether it will sway swing voters. Trump is scheduled to be interviewed by New York probation officials via a video conference Monday, a required step before his July sentencing.\n\nTemperatures in the Southwest have cooled since reaching historic highs late last week but remain above normal for this time of year and topped 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) at the rally, which took place at a park with little shade next to the airport.\n\nWell into his speech, Trump said it was \u201cnot as bad\u201d as he thought it would be, and said he was angrier with the teleprompters not working well, even when he used to mock President Barack Obama for relying on that device.\n\n\u201cI pay all this money to teleprompter people, and I\u2019d say 20 percent of the time, they don\u2019t work,\u201d he said, adding he would not pay the vendor who provided the prompters. \u201cIt\u2019s a mess.\u201d\n\nCampaign organizers handed out water bottles as supporters waited in line to be screened by security officers. Inside the venue, large misting fans, pallets of water and cooling tents were placed around the perimeter.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump has promised mass raids and deportation if he wins the election. The ACLU is preparing to fight back\n\n\u201cThis is a dry heat. This ain\u2019t nothing for Las Vegas people,\u201d Nevada GOP Chair Michael McDonald said. \u201cBut what it symbolizes for the rest of the United States \u2014 we will walk through hell\u201d to elect Donald Trump.\n\nMcDonald and five other Republicans have been accused of submitting certificates to Congress falsely declaring Trump the winner of Nevada\u2019s 2020 presidential election and their trial has been pushed to next year.\n\nTrump said the rioters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 to contest the election were \u201cvictims\u201d of a \u201cset up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were really, more than anything else, they are victims of what happened. All they were doing is protesting a rigged election. That\u2019s what they were doing. And then the police say, go in, go in, go in, go in,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat a set up that was. A horrible, horrible thing.\u201d\n\nThe conspiracy theory that the Jan. 6 rioters were encouraged by law enforcement is widespread on the right but has no basis in fact. Many of those who were at the Capitol on Jan. 6 have said \u2014 proudly, publicly, repeatedly \u2014 that they did so to help the then-president.\n\nWATCH: How Trump could upend the rule of law and pursue political prosecutions in a second term\n\nFederal and state election officials and Trump\u2019s own attorney general have said there is no credible evidence the 2020 election was tainted. The former president\u2019s allegations of fraud were also roundly rejected by courts, including by judges Trump appointed.\n\nThe campaign paid for additional EMS services to be on site in the case of emergency. The Secret Service made an exception to allow people to bring in personal water bottles and umbrellas.\n\n\u201cYou know what? It\u2019s worth it,\u201d said Camille Lombardi, a 65-year-old retired nurse from Henderson in suburban Las Vegas who was seeing Trump in person for the first time. \u201cToo bad it wasn\u2019t indoors, but that\u2019s OK.\u201d\n\nDuring a Trump rally in Arizona on Thursday, the Phoenix Police Department said 11 people were transported to hospitals, treated and released for heat exhaustion. Many of Trump\u2019s supporters waited in line for hours and some were unable to get inside before the venue reached capacity. The temperature reached a record 113 degrees Fahrenheit (45 degrees Celsius) that day.\n\nTrump\u2019s Nevada rally, his third in the state this year, came on the tail end of a Western swing that included several high-dollar fundraisers where he was expected to rake in millions of dollars.\n\nDemocrat Hillary Clinton won Nevada in 2016 as did President Joe Biden in 2020, but Nevada was the only battleground state where Trump did better against Biden than Clinton. In the 2022 midterms, Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, a Democrat, was the only incumbent governor who did not win reelection.\n\nTrump hopes his strength among working-class voters and growing interest from Latinos will push him to victory in the state.\n\nIn a play for Nevada\u2019s massive service-sector workforce, Trump said he\u2019d seek to eliminate taxes on tips, a major source of income for food servers, bartenders and others who power glitzy Las Vegas hotels.\n\nThe Culinary Union Secretary-Treasurer Ted Pappageorge criticized Trump for making that promise, a measure he said the union has fought for decades.\n\n\u201cRelief is definitely needed for tip earners, but Nevada workers are smart enough to know the difference between real solutions and wild campaign promises from a convicted felon,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign announced a renewed push for Hispanic voters ahead of the event with a Latino Americans for Trump Coalition. Four of the speakers who warmed up the crowd before Trump took the stage were Hispanic immigrants.\n\nGomez Licon reported from Miami.",

        "text": "Civil Beat Guide: Politics And Elections In Hawaii In 2024\nHere\u2019s our overview of this year\u2019s elections including links to essential information, candidate positions and news stories. Check back frequently \u2014 we\u2019ll be updating through Nov. 5.\n\nIt\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that the U.S. presidential election this year has become a global issue. People around the world are on edge over the matchup between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump.\n\nKalany Omengkar/Civil Beat/2024\n\nBut all politics is local, a speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives once observed. While the number of candidates who filed to run in Hawaii\u2019s 2024 elections is significantly lower than in recent years \u2014 and many incumbents face little or even no opposition \u2014 several hundred candidates will be on the ballot for the Aug. 10 primary. Review the full list here.\n\nVoters will have the chance to elect one of the state\u2019s two U.S. senators and both members of the U.S. House of Representatives. All 51 state House seats and 13 of the 25 Senate seats in the Hawaii Legislature are on the ballot.\n\nThere are nonpartisan county council races in all four counties, as well as mayoral contests in Honolulu and Hawaii County. A runoff is required if one mayoral candidate does not get more than 50% of the total votes cast in their particular race. Each county has its own system for determining which council candidates advance to the general election on Nov. 5.\n\nAnd nonpartisan contests will be held for some of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs board of trustees seats. OHA races also have provisions for runoffs.\n\nThe primary election is always the most important in Hawaii because the state is so heavily dominated by one political party \u2014 the Democrats. A number of the state-level races for the House and Senate will be decided in the primary.\n\nCivil Beat Elections Guide Hawaii\u2019s 2024 elections are right around the corner and Civil Beat\u2019s elections guide is here to help with essential information, candidate positions, news stories and more. See More\n\nTurnout And Voting\n\nHawaii has historically had one of the lowest voter turnout rates in the country. That changed in 2020 when Hawaii implemented mail-in balloting statewide, which helped boost turnout.\n\nOverall voter participation was the highest it had been since 1994, although it still lagged behind the tremendous turnout rates after statehood in 1959. It also dropped in the 2022 primary when elections officials reported a statewide turnout of about 39.6% of Hawaii\u2019s registered voters.\n\nWhere To Drop Off Your Absentee/Mail-in Ballot in Hawaii\n\nThe County Elections Divisions provide voter service centers that will be open 10 days prior to and on election day. Services include accessible in-person voting and same-day registration. And there are also drop box locations in all the counties.\n\nBallots for the primary are expected to begin arriving in the mail July 23. Completed ballots must be received by the County Elections Divisions by close of voting \u2014 7 p.m. \u2014 on Aug. 10. Voter service centers and drop boxes also close at that time. Ballots being delivered to the drop box won\u2019t be accepted after 7 p.m. \u2014 on the dot \u2014 but voters in line at 7 p.m. to cast ballots in person will still be able to vote.\n\nThis map from the state Office of Elections will help you find voting centers and drop boxes near you:\n\nRegister To Vote Or Request An Absentee Ballot\n\nVoters are also able to register online to vote. The deadline to register to vote for the Aug. 1 0 primary using a paper application is July 31. The deadline to request an absentee ballot is Aug. 3.\n\nIf you miss the deadline to register for the election, you can still walk in and register before and on election day (with proper ID or documentation of your residency) at Voter Service Centers, which will be open 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Mondays through Saturdays from July 29 through Aug. 10 for the primary.\n\nThe 2024 Primary Races\n\nYou can go to the state elections website to find the full list of candidates who will be on the primary ballot or use Civil Beat\u2019s unofficial primary ballot where we will link to candidates\u2019 Q&As, once they send it back to us. Some candidates will only be on the general election ballot, depending on how many others filed in their race. Others who have no opponent in the primary won\u2019t even be on the general election ballot, having won their seat already.\n\nNo U.S. senator from Hawaii has ever lost reelection, and only one U.S. representative from Hawaii failed to get reelected. Incumbent Mazie Hirono faces two other Democrats in the primary, while former state Rep. Bob McDermott is among the six Republican candidates. There is also a nonpartisan candidate in the Senate race along with two third party candidates.\n\nRepublicans, a Democrat and a nonpartisan candidate seek to represent Hawaii in the 1st Congressional District (covering the greater Honolulu area), which is held by U.S. Rep. Ed Case, a Democrat running for reelection.\n\nDemocrat U.S. Rep. Jill Tokuda is unopposed in the primary for the 2nd Congressional District (covering the rest of Oahu and all the neighbor islands). A Republican, a Libertarian and a nonpartisan candidate are running as well in the CD2 contest.\n\nSign-wavers on the corner of Beretania and Pensacola streets in Honolulu in 2020. (Ronen Zilberman/Civil Beat/2020)\n\nIn the Hawaii Legislature, all 51 House seats are up, as representatives serve two-year terms. In the Senate, which has four-year terms, Districts 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 12, 16, 18, 19, 22, 23 and 24 are up this year. So is District 5, which was scheduled to be up two years from now but is on the ballot this year because the incumbent resigned and was replaced by appointment.\n\nAll of the seats on the seven-member Kauai County Council, the nine-member Hawaii County Council and the nine-member Maui County Council are up this year, as are five of the seats on the nine-member Honolulu City Council.\n\nHonolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi and Hawaii County Mayor Mitch Roth each face several challengers. But the incumbent prosecuting attorneys for Honolulu, Kauai and the Big Island are unopposed.\n\nFour of the nine seats on the Office of Hawaiian Affairs Board of Trustees are up this year: one at-large seat and one seat each representing Oahu, Molokai and Kauai. Incumbents seeking reelection include Dan Ahuna, Luana Alapa and Kelii Akina. All registered voters statewide can vote in OHA elections.\n\nThere will two constitutional amendment questions on the general election ballot in 2024. All four counties are considering amendments to their respective governing charters, which will also be on the fall ballot.\n\nWhere To Find Out More\n\nThe Hawaii Office of Elections website is the best place to find basic information you need about the elections, including how and when to register, how to find your polling place and when you can begin casting your ballot.\n\nYou can keep up with all of Civil Beat\u2019s coverage as the election season progresses in our Hawaii Elections 2024 Guide.\n\nMeanwhile, here are some other resources we\u2019ve put together to help you through the 2024 elections:\n\nUnofficial 2024 Primary Election Ballot: Our way to help you keep track of races and candidates in your district. We are once again sending out questionnaires to candidates, asking them to give us their positions on key issues that are particular to the office they\u2019re running for. You will be able to find links to these Q&As on this page.\n\nHawaii Civics 101: Our series of short explainer videos helps you understand politics, government and democracy in the Aloha State.\n\nKalany Omengkar/Civil Beat/2024\n\nFind Your Districts\n\nThis map from the state Office of Elections shows the congressional, senatorial, representative and council district boundaries for the City and County of Honolulu. Election maps for Hawaii County, Maui County, Kauai County are also available on the state\u2019s website.\n\nTrack Your Ballot\n\nHawaii voters can enroll for ballot notifications ahead of the 2024 elections. Voters who sign up will be notified about the status of their mail ballot either through text, email or a phone message.\n\nVoters who choose not to sign up for ballot notifications will still be able to track their ballot by going to elections.hawaii.gov or by contacting their County Elections Division.\n\nBallot drop boxes are available statewide in select locations.\n\nVoter Education\n\nGet information and help from these organizations:\n\nCampaign Finance Resources\n\nBoth the state and the federal government impose contribution limits when giving directly to candidates. Money has been flowing to candidates and political committees for the 2024 elections. You can follow the money yourself on a number of online campaign and political sites:\n\nFederal candidates and committees:\n\nFederal Election Commission\n\nOpenSecrets (National Institute on Money in Politics, the Center for Responsive Politics and the Campaign Finance Institute)\n\nState candidates and committees, and financial disclosures:\n\nElections Offices Statewide\n\nThese offices oversee the elections in Hawaii:\n\nPolitical Parties",

        "text": "EU elections: What the European results and far-right surge tells us\nIn Brussels, at past EU leaders\u2019 summits, Emmanuel Macron has at times been accused of trying to steal the limelight.\n\nHe certainly managed that on Sunday night. Although probably not in the way he\u2019d have liked.\n\nAs votes for the European Parliament were still being counted, Mr Macron dominated the headlines.\n\nHis drubbing in the poll by French hard-right nationalists had been expected. His decision to dissolve France\u2019s national parliament as a result, came as a shock.\n\nHe had played with the idea last year, after getting trounced in France\u2019s last general election but few expected this move now.\n\nIt\u2019s a huge gamble. From a position of weakness.\n\nEmmanuel Macron describes himself as a centrist and a passionate European.\n\nThis snap general election, taking place in two rounds on 30 June and 7 July, could result in him having to work alongside a French prime minister from the Eurosceptic far right.\n\nMarine Le Pen, regularly portrayed as his political nemesis, declared on Sunday that her party was ready to govern.\n\nIt\u2019s happened before in France that the president, who is the country\u2019s most powerful politician, and the prime minister, hail from different political parties.\n\nBut if the new prime minister were to come from the far right, that would be a first for France.\n\nMarine Le Pen has worked hard in recent years to try to broaden the appeal of her political movement and to soften its extremist image.\n\nShe and her supporters hope this significant victory at EU level (her National Rally party garnered more than double the number of votes of President Macron\u2019s Renaissance party) will translate into huge wins in the snap election back home.\n\nHer dream would be that those successes would then bring her, or her hugely popular prodigee, the 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, a big stride closer to eventually becoming French president - something she\u2019s attempted and failed to achieve a number of times before. The next presidential vote in France is scheduled for 2027.",

        "text": "Europeans are worried about Trump's return to the White House\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz, US President Joe Biden, his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at the G7 summit in Japan, May 21, 2023. AVALON/ABACA\n\nOnce the European elections, scheduled for June 6-9, are over, the 27 member states will turn their attention to another election, which in some respects is just as decisive for Europe's future. On November 5, on the other side of the Atlantic, Americans will choose their next president. For the European Union (EU), this could mean the return of Donald Trump to the White House.\n\nTrump's first term left the EU 27 with some bad memories. Today, apart from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who on March 8 met his \"good friend\" Trump in his Mar-a-Lago mansion, and Italian Council President Giorgia Meloni, whose party, Fratelli d'Italia, maintains friendly relations with the Republican candidate's team, no European leader is looking forward to him taking the helm once again.\n\nBut, in a way, the four years Europeans have spent working with Joe Biden have prepared them for this. It's true that the Democratic president has warmed up a transatlantic relationship that his predecessor had damaged. True, he has stood by the Europeans and Kyiv since the start of the war in Ukraine. But, in essence, the Biden years have only affably confirmed Washington's relative disinterest in Europe.\n\nTrade disputes\n\nThis is most evident in the economic field. For example, when Biden announced the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in August 2022, which provides massive subsidies for green technologies made in America, he was unconcerned that this new legislation could lead to relocations from Europe to the US. \"The US has confessed to us that it has taken these measures without even imagining the consequences for the rest of the world,\" said the Elys\u00e9e Palace.\n\nBiden had no more scruples when, in mid-May, he announced major tariff increases on products imported from China (electric vehicles, steel, aluminum, semiconductors, batteries, certain essential minerals and photovoltaic cells). However, \"what China won't sell to the US, it will dump on Europe. Biden has just started a trade war,\" said a senior European official.\n\nRead more Subscribers only Protectionist escalation: 'Europe could be engulfed in the economic rivalry between China and the US'\n\nEven though Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the EU Commission, invested plenty in her personal relationship with the American president, she didn't get much out of it. Washington has only marginally modified its IRA arrangements. As for the trade disputes that pre-existed Biden's election \u2013 the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on aluminum and steel, the Airbus-Boeing dispute \u2013 they have been the subject of a truce between the two sides, but are still unresolved.\n\nYou have 73.87% of this article left to read.

        "text": "Meloni has won over Biden, now she hopes for Trump's return\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni greets supporters at a campaign meeting of the far-right Fratelli d'Italia party for the European elections, in Rome, Italy, on June 1, 2024. TIZIANA FABI / AFP\n\nAs Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni prepares to host the G7 summit in Puglia from June 13 to 15, just a few days after the European elections (June 6-9), she can congratulate herself on having won the confidence of US President Joe Biden's administration. However, her national-conservative camp, represented by the Fratelli d'Italia party, has not distanced itself from the galaxy of former president and Republican candidate Donald Trump, with whom Meloni's forces have been mixing with for years.\n\nBetween Italy and the United States, networks have developed and are redoubling their activity in the run-up to the US presidential election in November. Admittedly, Meloni refrains from publicly supporting Trump in his legal woes, contrary to her ally and vice president of the council, Matteo Salvini (Lega, far right), who boasted of having spoken to him on the phone on June 5. She is no less enthusiastically received by those in the American Republican universe who are interested in Europe. Some go so far as to see in her the promise of a new Margaret Thatcher (1925-2013), British prime minister from 1979 to 1990 and conservative benchmark par excellence.\n\nRead more Subscribers only Europeans are worried about Trump's return to the White House\n\nAt the same time, Meloni has built up a warm relationship with Biden, symbolized in the eyes of the press by the kiss he placed on her forehead during the Italian leader's last visit to Washington on March 1.\n\nThe key to the Melonian paradox\n\nIn both the US and Europe, where the Italian prime minister plays the institutional game and makes herself unavoidable, the key to the Melonian paradox lies in the leader's turnaround on Ukraine. \"At first, concern prevailed,\" said Charles Kupchan, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and adviser on European affairs in the administrations of presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. \"Then Meloni proved solid in her support for Kyiv, earning her a place in the Oval Office. We also realized that she hadn't joined populists Viktor Orban of Hungary or Jaroslaw Kaczynski of Poland in their opposition to the rest of Europe. She has integrated herself into the institutions.\" From an American perspective \u2013 Democrat or Republican \u2013 Italy's exit from China's Belt and Road Initiative, in December 2023, is also to the credit of the council president.\n\nRead more Subscribers only Giorgia Meloni's European double bluff\n\nIt was not so long ago, however, that Meloni was extolling the virtues of Russian President Vladimir Putin, condemning sanctions against Moscow and calling for the destruction of the European Union, as in 2019 at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), the major annual meeting of American conservatives. Trump then served as a major reference for a politician still very much in the minority. Meloni, courted by MAGA ideologue Steve Bannon, then called Obama, of whom Biden was vice president, a \"friend of Islamic fundamentalists.\" During the January 6, 2021 assault on the Capitol by supporters of Trump (whose victory she had openly wished for), she presented the outgoing president as a peacemaking figure.\n\nYou have 55.14% of this article left to read.

        "text": "US election: Climate experts react to Donald Trump\u2019s victory\nTrump is expected to cut spending on green energy and boost US production of fossil fuels, while pulling his country out of the Paris climate accord\n\nBy Joe Lo\n\nWith Donald Trump winning a come-back victory as president of the United States and results pointing to Republican control of both chambers of Congress, analysts and commentators around the world are offering their views on what this means for the world\u2019s battle to tackle climate change.\n\nAt home, Trump \u2013 a climate-change sceptic \u2013 has promised to encourage the production of fossil fuels and rein in Biden\u2019s green economy spending.\n\nInternationally, he has said he would withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement, as he did briefly during his first term in office. He is reportedly also considering trying to quit the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the treaty that establishes the basic architecture for countries to work together to address climate change. And he may cut the US\u2019s climate finance contributions to developing countries.\n\n\n\nClimate Home has compiled reactions from climate experts in the US and beyond on the implications of a Trump victory for global climate policy and climate action in the United States:\n\nTodd Stern, former US climate envoy\n\nSpeaking before the election, Todd Stern \u2013 who was former President Barack Obama\u2019s chief climate negotiator, including on the Paris Agreement \u2013 said that if Trump blocks efforts to cut his country\u2019s CO2 emissions, it \u201cwill be very disappointing \u2013 to put it mildly\u201d. But, he added, \u201cthe machine is moving \u2013 the wheels that are spinning in all elements of clean technology are not going to stop\u201d.\n\nHe said Trump would try to pull back Biden\u2019s green spending through legislative mechanisms like the Inflation Reduction Act. But \u201cin many cases, they won\u2019t be able to do that\u201d, Stern added, because a lot of the spending has been in states with Republican Congressmen and Governors who are \u201cnot going to want those things to be undermined because of jobs and employment\u201d.\n\nGina McCarthy, former US presidential climate adviser and Environmental Protection Agency administrator\n\nEchoing Stern, McCarthy said \u201cthe shift to clean energy is unstoppable and our country is not turning back\u201d. She added that the EPA and all public servants \u201cstand ready to do their jobs, follow the science, and protect the rule of law\u201d. \u201cWe all must stand ready to hold this administration accountable to do its job of protecting our people and our environment,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cBloomberg\u2019s America Is All In [a coalition of local leaders supporting climate action] will work with cities, states and the private sector to do everything in its power to stop this administration from unwinding the progress we\u2019ve made on climate,\u201d she said.\n\nSimon Stiell, head of the UNFCCC\n\nSpeaking in the Azerbaijani city of Baku today, which will host COP29 next week, the Grenadian diplomat said that \u201cthe fundamental facts remain unchanged\u201d.\n\nHe said \u201cglobal heating is already hammering every nation\u201d and \u201cthose investing in clean energy are already enjoying huge wins in terms of jobs and wealth, and cheaper, more secure energy.\u201d\n\nHe warned: \u201cUnless all countries can cut emissions and build more resilience into global supply chains, no economy \u2013 including the G20 \u2013 will survive unchecked global heating, and no household will be spared its severe inflationary impacts.\u201d\n\nJennifer Morgan, German government climate envoy\n\nThe US-born diplomat said that the German government would \u201cwork with the next US administration wherever possible to strengthen the international rules-based order and deal with shared security challenges, including the climate crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor Germany and the EU the transition to climate neutrality is a cornerstone of our future competitiveness. We therefore will work with all partners towards a level playing field in the race for green industries,\u201d she added.\n\nChristiana Figueres, former head of the UNFCCC\n\nThe Costa Rican diplomat, who oversaw the Paris Agreement in 2015, said the US election result was a \u201cmajor blow to global climate action, but it cannot and will not halt the changes underway to decarbonise the economy and meet the goals of the Paris Agreement\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201cStanding with oil and gas is the same as falling behind in a fast-moving world. Clean energy technologies will continue to out-compete fossil fuels, not just because they are healthier, faster, cleaner and more abundant, but because they undercut fossil fuels where they are at their weakest: their unsolvable volatility and inefficiency.\u201d\n\nIzabella Teixeira, former Brazilian environment minister\n\nTeixeira, Brazil\u2019s environment minister from 2010 to 2016, said \u201cthere is no room for climate denialism in the context of the climate emergency\u201d. \u201cAmerican society is co-responsible for global warming and, despite Trump\u2019s victory, will undoubtedly be co-responsible for the solutions to the climate crisis,\u201d she added.\n\nLaurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation and architect of the Paris Agreement\n\nThe French diplomat said: \u201cThe US election result is a setback for global climate action, but the Paris Agreement has proven resilient and is stronger than any single country\u2019s policies.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cThe context today is very different to [when Donald Trump was first elected in] 2016. There is powerful economic momentum behind the global transition, which the US has led and gained from, but now risks forfeiting.\u201d\n\nBill Hare, climate scientist and CEO of Climate Analytics\n\nHare, who has contributed to the flagship scientific reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), warned that \u201cthe election of a climate denier to the US Presidency is extremely dangerous for the world\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe are already seeing extreme damages, loss of life around the globe due to human-induced warming 1.3C. President Trump will not be above the laws of physics and nor will the country that he leads. If Trump follows through with his threat to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, the biggest loser will be the United States.\u201d\n\nYao Zhe, global policy advisor at Greenpeace East Asia\n\nZhe said: \u201cChina finds itself at a pivotal moment. Expectations are high that China will join key nations in reassuring the world that climate action will continue.\u201d She added that, to reassure the world, China should submit a new UN climate plan \u201cthat outlines clear actions to transition away from fossil fuels\u201d.\n\n\u201cClimate played a crucial role in stabilising US-China relations during the Biden time. The Trump administration may undo some of the climate diplomacy gains of recent years, but US-China climate cooperation will continue at the subnational level and among non-state actors,\u201d she concluded.\n\nLi Shuo, director of China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute\n\nCommenting on who is going to fill the vacuum left by the US if Trump pulls the country out of the UNFCCC, he equated global climate policy to a \u201ctricycle with the three biggest emitters and economies \u2013 the US, China and the EU \u2013 as its wheels\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou need at least two wheels to function at any time,\u201d Li added. \u201cWe just missed one wheel now so we need the other two, the EU and China, to carry us forward.\u201d\n\nMary Robinson, former prime minister of Ireland\n\nRobinson said: \u201cI sincerely hope that the recent hurricanes in the United States have caused President Trump to rethink his belief that climate change will create \u2018more oceanfront properties\u2019. It will only bring more death and devastation.\u201d\n\nShe called for a redoubling of efforts by those working to tackle global warming, adding: \u201cThe outcome of the US elections should not be used as an excuse by world leaders to avoid taking action against climate change.\u201d\n\nCollin Rees, Oil Change International\u2019s US program manager\n\nRees called for Biden to \u201csecure his climate legacy\u201d by ending fossil fuel expansion, making permanent a pause on LNG gas exports, shutting down the Dakota Access oil pipeline and fulfilling the US\u2019s commitment to stop financing international fossil fuel projects.\n\n\u201cWhat Biden does now will determine whether he\u2019ll be remembered as the leader who did his utmost to limit the Trump administration\u2019s damage and keep the world from hurtling towards climate chaos,\u201d he said.\n\nFatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency\n\n\n\nThe Turkish energy analyst congratulated Trump in a social media post on X and said that, as during his first term, the International Energy Agency \u201clooks forward to working closely with your new administration to support US energy policy goals and to advance global efforts towards affordable, secure & sustainable energy.\u201d\n\nAvantika Goswami, climate lead at the Centre for Science and Environment\n\nThe Delhi-based campaigner said that financing is one of the biggest enablers of decarbonisation. \u201cNot only do we need bilateral aid \u2013 which a Trump Presidency is likely to gut \u2013 but the US also controls the global financial system largely and uses the hegemony of the dollar to assert its power.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother Trump term\u201d, she said, \u201cno doubts make the much-needed reform of the global financial architecture all the more tricky.\u201d The Biden administration pursued green reform of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.\n\nShe said that other developed countries and emerging economies should \u201clead the way to ramp up decarbonisation, because we know how high the costs of inaction are\u201d.\n\nTim McPhie, European Commission spokesperson for climate action and energy\n\nAsked about the election result, McPhie told a press conference that climate action was a matter of \u201csecurity and opportunity\u201d and job creation for both the EU and US.\n\nFollowing floods in Spain and hurricanes in the US, McPhie said that \u201cboth Europe and America have suffered in recent weeks and months from the devastating impacts of climate change. We need to protect our citizens from climate risks while working to keep them to a minimum.\u201d\n\nArmond Cohen, Clean Air Task Force executive director\n\nThe head of the US-based environmental campaign group noted that three-fifths of the nation \u2013 measured by sales and power emissions \u2013 is covered by laws or utility pledges to achieve zero carbon emissions within the next couple of decades.\n\n\u201cDriven by these commitments,\u201d Cohen added, \u201cwind and solar will likely continue their record pace of deployment, while we are also seeing a revival of interest from governors of both parties in sustaining carbon-free nuclear energy \u2013 both existing and new. Texas, a conservative state, is even outpacing California in solar deployment.\u201d\n\nMohamed Adow, director of Power Shift Africa\n\nThe Kenyan campaigner said that the \u201crest of the world isn\u2019t going to let one country derail global progress in tackling it. The transition away from climate-wrecking dirty energy to clean renewables is more essential than ever.\u201d\n\nHe said the Biden administration\u2019s delegation to COP29 needs to push at the summit for a \u201cstrong outcome that will ensure the global momentum continues\u201d.\n\nRaila Odinga, former Kenyan prime minister\n\nOdinga, who is a candidate for chair of the African Union Commission, said that US actions on climate \u201cwill shape how Africa, a continent that is least responsible for the climate crisis yet suffering most from climate impacts, will navigate its own development path\u201d and \u201cdeliver energy access to over 600 million people who are without electricity access today.\u201d\n\nHe said COP29 was \u201ca perfect opportunity for the US to step up and be a global steward of the planet\u201d by supporting the delivery of \u201cambitious grants-based and highly concessional climate finance\u201d.\n\nArunabha Ghosh, CEO of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water\n\nThe Indian think-tank analyst said Trump\u2019s \u201cproposed trade barriers will need careful navigation so that Indian industries, especially for clean technologies, do not suffer\u201d.\n\nHe noted that India exports 90% of its solar modules to the US and \u201cwill need to be prepared and strategically nimble to deepen green trade, co-develop clean tech supply chains, and accelerate its energy transition\u201d.\n\n\u201cWith Donald Trump in power, India can count on continued oil and gas supply to ensure its developmental needs since the US is a net exporter of fuels now. Between 2017 and 2024, the US became the fifth-largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) and crude oil supplier to India,\u201d he noted.\n\nFaten Aggad, executive director, African Future Policies Hub\n\nAggad, who formerly advised the African Union (AU) high representative on AU-EU negotiations, asked \u201cwhat impact would a likely acceleration of the trade war with China have on supply chains and therefore the affordability and access to key green technologies?\u201d\n\nShe said that \u201ca successful green transition hinges on trade cooperation \u2013 and the likely increased protectionism in the US, which is likely to be mimicked in the EU, is a concern.\u201d\n\n(Reporting by Climate Home news team; editing by Megan Rowling)",

        "text": "Arizona Man Charged with Selling Guns for Use in Mass Shooting\nPHOENIX, Ariz. \u2013 Mark Adams Prieto, 58, of Prescott, was indicted by a federal grand jury today on Firearms Trafficking, Transfer of a Firearm for Use in a Hate Crime, and Possession of an Unregistered Firearm.\n\nThe indictment alleges that, between January 2024 and May 2024, Prieto had discussions with two individuals working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation to devise a plan to commit a mass shooting of African Americans and other minorities to incite a race war prior to the 2024 United States Presidential Election. Prieto did not know the individuals were working with the government, but instead believed that they shared his racist beliefs and wanted to commit a mass shooting to incite a race war. The targeted event was a concert in Atlanta that was going to be held on May 14 and May 15, 2024.\n\nThe indictment further alleges that, having discussed specific details about the planned attack, Prieto sold two rifles to one of the individuals, an AK-style rifle on February 25, 2024, and an AR-style rifle on March 24, 2024. During the entire investigation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation closely monitored Prieto\u2019s movements. On May 14, 2024, Prieto was stopped by law enforcement driving east from Arizona through New Mexico along Interstate 40. Prieto was in possession of seven firearms and was taken into federal custody. Law enforcement then executed a search warrant at his home in Prescott. Law enforcement found more firearms in his residence, including an unregistered short-barreled rifle.\n\nEach conviction for Firearms Trafficking and Transfer of Firearm for Use in a Hate Crime carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison, a fine of $250,000, or both. A conviction for Possession of an Unregistered Firearm carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison, a fine of $250,000, or both.\n\nAn indictment is simply a method by which a person is charged with criminal activity and raises no inference of guilt. An individual is presumed innocent until evidence is presented to a jury that establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nThe Phoenix Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation conducted the investigation in this case, with assistance from the Phoenix Field Division of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Albuquerque Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Veteran\u2019s Affairs Office of Inspector General, the Arizona Attorney General\u2019s Office, and the Prescott Police Department. Valuable assistance was provided by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of New Mexico. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, District of Arizona, Phoenix, is handling the prosecution, along with the U.S Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division, and the U.S. Department of Justice, National Security Division\u2019s Counterterrorism Section.\n\n\n\nRELEASE NUMBER: 2024-074_Prieto\n\n# # #\n\nFor more information on the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, District of Arizona, visit http://www.justice.gov/usao/az/\n\nFollow the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, District of Arizona, on X @USAO_AZ for the latest news.",

        "text": "Globally, Biden Receives Higher Ratings Than Trump\nStill, most disapprove of how Biden has dealt with the Israel-Hamas war\n\nHow we did this This Pew Research Center analysis focuses on public opinion of the United States, President Joe Biden and other world leaders. It also explores what people think about Biden\u2019s handling of international issues and their perceptions of American democracy. The study includes publics in 34 countries across the Asia-Pacific region, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, North America and sub-Saharan Africa. This analysis draws on nationally representative surveys of 40,566 adults conducted from Jan. 5 to May 21, 2024. All surveys were conducted over the phone with adults in Canada, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Surveys were conducted face to face in Argentina, Bangladesh, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ghana, Hungary, India, Israel, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Tunisia and Turkey. In Australia, we used a mixed-mode probability-based online panel. Throughout the report, we analyze respondents\u2019 attitudes based on where they place themselves on an ideological scale. We asked about political ideology using several slightly different scales and categorized people as being on the ideological left, center or right. In most countries, we asked people to place themselves on a scale ranging from \u201cExtreme left\u201d to \u201cExtreme right.\u201d The question was asked this way in Argentina, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and the United Kingdom.\n\nIn Australia, the scale ranged from \u201cLeft\u201d to \u201cRight\u201d.\n\nIn Japan, Singapore, South Korea and Thailand, ideology was measured on a scale from \u201cExtremely progressive\u201d to \u201cExtremely conservative.\u201d\n\nIdeology was not asked about in Ghana, India, Kenya, Malaysia, Sri Lanka or Tunisia. Prior to 2024, combined totals were based on rounded topline figures. For all reports beginning in 2024, totals are based on unrounded topline figures, so combined totals might be different than in previous years. Refer to the 2024 topline to see our new rounding procedures applied to past years\u2019 data. Here are the questions used for the report, along with responses, and the survey methodology.\n\nWith many around the world closely following the fiercely contested rematch between U.S. President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, a new Pew Research Center survey finds that, internationally, Biden is viewed more positively than his rival.\n\nAcross the 34 nations polled, a median of 43% have confidence in Biden to do the right thing regarding world affairs, while just 28% have confidence in Trump. The gap between ratings is quite wide in many countries, especially in Europe. Biden\u2019s confidence rating is at least 40 percentage points higher than Trump\u2019s in Germany, the Netherlands, Poland and Sweden.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions. There is no statistically significant difference in ratings of Biden and Trump in eight nations we surveyed. And people in Hungary and Tunisia give Trump more positive reviews than Biden, although neither leader gets especially high marks there. (The survey was conducted before Trump\u2019s conviction in a state criminal trial in New York.)\n\nEven though Biden gets better assessments than Trump globally, ratings for the current U.S. president are down since last year in 14 of 21 countries where trends are available, including by double digits in Australia, Israel, Japan, Poland, South Africa, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe survey included a series of questions about how Biden is handling major international issues. Overall, opinions are divided on how he is dealing with climate change and global economic problems.\n\nAcross the 34 countries polled, a median of around four-in-ten approve of how Biden is dealing with China and with the war between Russia and Ukraine (39% each).\n\nThe president gets his most negative reviews on his handling of the Israel-Hamas war: A median of just 31% approve of the way he is handling the conflict, while 57% disapprove. (The survey was conducted prior to Biden announcing a proposal to end the conflict.)\n\nResearch in the West Bank and Gaza Pew Research Center has polled the Palestinian territories in previous years, but we were unable to conduct fieldwork in Gaza or the West Bank for our Spring 2024 survey due to security concerns. We are actively investigating possibilities for both qualitative and quantitative research on public opinion in the region and hope to be able to share data from the region in the coming months.\n\nSix-in-ten Israelis disapprove of how Biden is handling the war, including 53% of Jewish Israelis and 86% of Arab Israelis. (For more on how Israelis rate Biden, read \u201cIsraeli Views of the Israel-Hamas War.\u201d)\n\nOf the predominantly Muslim nations surveyed, large majorities in Malaysia, Tunisia and Turkey also disapprove of Biden\u2019s handling of the Israel-Hamas war. Opinion is divided on this issue in Bangladesh.\n\nThe new survey finds that overall attitudes toward the United States are generally positive: A median of 54% across the nations polled have a favorable view of the U.S., while 31% have a negative opinion.\n\nHowever, criticisms of American democracy are common in many nations. We asked respondents whether U.S. democracy is a good example for other countries to follow, used to be a good example but has not been in recent years, or has never been a good example.\n\nThe predominant view in most countries is that the U.S. used to be a good model but has not been recently. Overall, a median of 21% believe it is currently a good example, while 22% say it has never been a good model for other countries.\n\nIn eight of the 13 countries where trends are available, fewer people say American democracy is a good example than said so in spring 2021, when we last asked this question.\n\nFor this report, we surveyed 40,566 people in 34 countries \u2013 not including the U.S. \u2013 from Jan. 5 to May 21, 2024. In addition to this overview, the report includes chapters on:\n\nRead some of the report\u2019s key findings below.\n\nViews of the U.S.\n\nAt least half of those in most countries surveyed express a favorable opinion of the U.S. Poles are the most positive, at 86% favorable. Of the European nations surveyed, ratings also lean positive in Italy, Hungary and the UK. Elsewhere in Europe, however, opinions tend to be closely divided.\n\nAttitudes toward the U.S. are largely favorable in the Asia-Pacific nations polled, especially Japan, the Philippines, South Korea and Thailand. However, most Australians and Malaysians give the U.S. poor marks.\n\nIn the Middle East-North Africa region, a 77% majority of Israelis view the U.S. favorably, although this is down from 87% last year. Large majorities in Tunisia and Turkey offer an unfavorable opinion.\n\nThe U.S. gets mostly positive ratings in the sub-Saharan African and Latin American nations surveyed. Two-thirds or more see the U.S. favorably in Colombia, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and Peru.\n\nRefer to Appendix A for long-term trends on views of the U.S.\n\nConfidence in Biden, Trump and other world leaders\n\nPew Research Center has explored attitudes toward American presidents for over two decades, finding significant shifts in opinions over the years. Data from four Western European nations that we have surveyed consistently \u2013 France, Germany, Spain and the UK \u2013 shows long-term trends in views of recent presidents.\n\nGeorge W. Bush received low and declining ratings during his time in the White House, while Barack Obama got mostly high marks. Attitudes toward Donald Trump were overwhelmingly negative throughout his presidency. Biden has consistently received more positive reviews than his predecessor, but his ratings have declined in these four countries during his time in office.\n\nThere are nine nations in this year\u2019s survey where six-in-ten adults or more express confidence in Biden. Four are in Europe (Germany, the Netherlands, Poland and Sweden), two are in the Asia-Pacific region (the Philippines and Thailand) and three are in sub-Saharan Africa (Ghana, Kenya and Nigeria).\n\nSince last year, confidence in Biden has dropped significantly in 14 nations: Seven in Europe, plus Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, Mexico, South Africa and South Korea. Biden gets his lowest ratings in Turkey and Tunisia, where only about one-in-ten express confidence in him.\n\nThe two countries where at least six-in-ten adults have confidence in Trump are Nigeria and the Philippines. Like Biden, Trump gets one of his lowest ratings in Turkey, where just 10% view him favorably.\n\nConfidence in Trump has increased slightly in a few European countries since we last asked about him in 2020, although his ratings remain quite low in Europe.\n\nIn contrast, Trump\u2019s ratings have become more negative in Poland since 2019, which was the last year we asked about him there. Israeli views toward the former president have also become more negative over the past five years.\n\nRefer to Appendix B for long-term trends in confidence in U.S. presidents.\n\nIn addition to exploring confidence in Biden and Trump, the survey asked about trust in French President Emmanuel Macron, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nOverall, Macron receives the most positive ratings across the countries in the study, followed closely by Biden. The French president gets higher ratings than his U.S. counterpart in many of the European nations surveyed. Both Xi and Putin receive mostly poor marks across the countries in the study.\n\nDifferences by ideology, age and gender\n\nIdeology\n\nIn 17 of the 28 countries where political ideology is measured, people on the right are more likely to have a positive opinion of the U.S. than those on the left. For example, 65% of people on the right in Spain view the U.S. favorably, compared with 26% of people on the left.\n\nthan those on the left. For example, 65% of people on the right in Spain view the U.S. favorably, compared with 26% of people on the left. In 18 countries, people on the right are more likely to express confidence in Trump than those on the left. The gap is especially large in Israel, where 75% of those on the right have confidence in him, compared with just 23% of Israelis on the left.\n\nthan those on the left. The gap is especially large in Israel, where 75% of those on the right have confidence in him, compared with just 23% of Israelis on the left. There are also some sizable ideological differences on views about Biden\u2019s handling of the Israel-Hamas war. In several countries \u2013 including about half of the European countries surveyed \u2013 people on the right are more likely than those on the left to approve of how Biden is handling the conflict.\n\nAge\n\nIn several countries \u2013 including Canada, all Latin American countries surveyed and several countries in the Asia-Pacific region \u2013 adults under 35 are more likely to have a positive opinion of the U.S. when compared with adults ages 50 and older. Australia, Israel and Sweden are the only countries where younger adults have a less favorable view of the U.S.\n\nwhen compared with adults ages 50 and older. Australia, Israel and Sweden are the only countries where younger adults have a less favorable view of the U.S. In Canada, Australia and seven of the 10 European countries surveyed, young adults are less likely than older adults to approve of how Biden is dealing with the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nGender",

        "text": "Fox News projects Trump victory in Pennsylvania\nPHILADELPHIA: Fox News projected that Republican Donald Trump has won the battleground state of Pennsylvania, which would all but close off Democrat Kamala Harris\u2019 chances of winning the U.S. presidency.\n\nOther networks and data providers had yet to make a call in the state.\n\nTrump has already won the swing states of North Carolina and Georgia in Tuesday\u2019s U.S. presidential election, according to Edison Research, taking him closer to completing a stunning political comeback four years after he left the White House.\n\nHe was showing strength across broad swaths of the country. The former president was headed to a convention center near his home in Palm Beach, Florida, to address supporters, a campaign aide told Reuters.\n\nRepublicans won a U.S. Senate majority after flipping Democratic seats in West Virginia and Ohio. Neither party appeared to have an edge in the fight for control of the House of Representatives where Republicans currently hold a narrow majority.\n\nTrump went into Election Day with a 50-50 chance of reclaiming the White House, a remarkable turnaround from Jan. 6, 2021, when many pundits pronounced his political career to be over. That day, a mob of his supporters stormed Congress in a violent attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nTrump picked up more support from Hispanics, traditionally Democratic voters, and among lower-income households that have keenly felt the sting of price rises since the last presidential election in 2020, according to exit polls from Edison.\n\nTrump won 45% of Hispanic voters nationwide, trailing Harris with 53% but up 13 percentage points from 2020.\n\nAbout 31% of voters said the economy was their top issue, and they voted for Trump by a 79%-to-20% margin, according to exit polls. Some 45% of voters across the country said their family\u2019s financial situation was worse off today than four years ago, and they favored Trump 80% to 17%.\n\nGlobal investors were increasingly pricing in a Trump win late on Tuesday. U.S. stock futures and the dollar pushed higher, while Treasury yields climbed and bitcoin rose - all flagged by analysts and investors as trades that favor a Trump victory.\n\n\u201cOur county-by-county analysis in key states suggests that Harris is lagging vs 2020, and on this basis it is logical that the market is starting to price a Trump win, as seen in bonds, and the dollar,\u201c said Jens Nordvig, CEO at analytical firm Exante.\n\nAt Howard University, where a large watch party was being held for Harris, supporters were leaving in droves, anticipating that the vice president would not address the crowd on Tuesday night.\n\nCedric Richmond, a co-chair of the Harris campaign, briefly addressed the crowd, and said Harris would not speak. \u201cWe still have votes to count,\u201c he said. \u201cWe still have states that haven\u2019t been called yet.\u201d\n\nTRUMP OUTPERFORMS 2020\n\nTrump was earning a bigger share of the vote than he did four years ago in nearly every corner of the country, from suburban Georgia to rural Pennsylvania.\n\nBy 12:30 a.m. ET, officials had nearly completed their count of ballots in more than 1,600 counties \u2013 about half the country \u2013 and Trump\u2019s share was up about 2 percentage points compared to 2020, reflecting a broad if not especially deep shift in Americans\u2019 support for the president they ousted four years ago.\n\nHe improved his numbers in suburban counties, rural regions and even some large cities that are historically bastions of Democratic support; in high-income counties and low-income ones; and in places where unemployment was comparatively high and in places where it is now at record lows.\n\nHarris had banked on urban and suburban voters, but her support in those places was running well behind Biden\u2019s.\n\nNearly three-quarters of voters said American democracy is under threat, according to the exit polls, underscoring the depth of polarization in a nation where divisions have only grown starker during a fiercely competitive race.\n\nTrump employed increasingly apocalyptic rhetoric while stoking unfounded fears that the election system cannot be trusted. Harris warned that a second Trump term would threaten the underpinnings of American democracy.\n\nHours before polls closed, Trump claimed on his Truth Social site without evidence that there was \u201ca lot of talk about massive CHEATING\u201d in Philadelphia, echoing his false claims in 2020 that fraud had occurred in large, Democratic-dominated cities. In a subsequent post, he also asserted there was fraud in Detroit.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t respond to nonsense,\u201c Detroit City Clerk Janice Winfrey told Reuters.\n\nA Philadelphia city commissioner, Seth Bluestein, replied on X, \u201cThere is absolutely no truth to this allegation.\u201d\n\nDIZZYING CAMPAIGN\n\nTrump voted earlier near his home in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\n\u201cIf I lose an election, if it\u2019s a fair election, I\u2019m gonna be the first one to acknowledge it,\u201c Trump told reporters.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk, a prominent Trump backer, watched the results at Mar-a-Lago with Trump.\n\nMillions of Americans waited in orderly lines to cast ballots, with only sporadic disruptions reported across a handful of states, including several non-credible bomb threats that the FBI said appeared to originate from Russian email domains.\n\nTuesday\u2019s vote capped a dizzying race churned by unprecedented events, including two assassination attempts against Trump, President Joe Biden\u2019s surprise withdrawal and Harris\u2019 rapid rise.\n\nNo matter who wins, history will be made.\n\nHarris, 60, the first female vice president, would become the first woman, Black woman and South Asian American to win the presidency. Trump, 78, the only president to be impeached twice and the first former president to be criminally convicted, would also become the first president to win non-consecutive terms in more than a century.",

        "text": "Trump claims victory over Harris in US presidential election\nWASHINGTON: Donald Trump claimed victory and pledged to \u201cheal\u201d the country Wednesday as results put him on the verge of beating Kamala Harris in a stunning White House comeback.\n\nHis exuberant speech came despite the fact that only Fox News had declared him the winner, with no other US networks having made the call so far.\n\nAs jubilant supporters cheered and chanted \u201cUSA\u201d, Trump took to the stage at his campaign headquarters in Florida along with his wife Melania and several of his children.\n\n\u201cWe are going to help our country heal,\u201c the Republican former president said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a political victory that our country has never seen before.\u201d\n\nALSO READ: Trump on verge of victory over Harris\n\nUS networks have called the swing states of Pennsylvania, Georgia and North Carolina for the 78-year-old, and he led the Democratic vice president in the others although they have not been called yet.\n\nGloom swiftly descended on Harris\u2019s camp.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t hear from the vice president tonight but you will hear from her tomorrow,\u201c Cedric Richmond, Harris campaign co-chair, told a watch party in Washington as supporters left.\n\nIn a further blow to Democrats, Trump\u2019s Republican Party also seized control of the Senate, flipping two seats to overturn a narrow Democratic majority.\n\nA Trump victory threatens to cause shockwaves around the world, as US allies in Europe and Asia fear a return of his nationalist policies and his praise of autocrats like Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin.\n\nBut the US dollar surged and bitcoin hit a record high while most equity markets advanced as traders bet on a victory for Trump as the results rolled in.\n\nMood shift\n\nPolls for weeks had shown a knife-edge race between Harris and Trump, who would be the oldest ever president at the time of inauguration, the first felon president and only the second in history to serve non-consecutive terms.\n\nTrump also faces sentencing in a criminal case over hush money payments on November 26, while the controversy over his denial of his 2020 election defeat by Joe Biden still persists.\n\nBut in the end victory came surprisingly quickly.\n\nThe mood shifted sharply at Harris\u2019s watch party in Howard University -- her former college and a historically Black university in Washington -- as the results came in.\n\n\u201cI am scared,\u201c said Charlyn Anderson. \u201cI am anxious now. I am leaving, my legs can barely move.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, the celebrations intensified at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and the watch party nearby.\n\nTech tycoon Elon Musk, who has backed Trump and stands to lead a government efficiency commission under him, posted a picture of himself with the Republican.\n\n\u201cGame, set and match,\u201c Musk said on X, the social media network he owns along with the Tesla electric vehicle firm and the Space X company.\n\nMillions of Americans had lined up throughout Election Day -- and millions more voted early -- in a race with momentous consequences for the United States and the world.\n\nThey were deciding whether to either hand a historic comeback to Trump or make Harris the first woman in the world\u2019s most powerful job.\n\nIn a stark reminder of the tension -- and fears of outright violence -- dozens of bomb threats were made against polling stations in Georgia and Pennsylvania.\n\nThe FBI said the threats appeared to originate in Russia, which is accused by Washington of trying to meddle in the election. The threats were all hoaxes but succeeded in disrupting proceedings.\n\nDark rhetoric\n\nHarris, 60, had aiming to be only the second Black and first person of South Asian descent to be president.\n\nShe made a dramatic entrance into the race when Biden dropped out in July, while Trump -- twice impeached while president -- has since ridden out two assassination attempts and a criminal conviction.\n\nShe hammered home her message that Trump was a threat to democracy and her opposition to Trump-backed abortion bans.\n\nTrump has vowed an unprecedented deportation campaign of millions of undocumented immigrants, in a campaign full of dark rhetoric.\n\nThe election is being watched closely around the world including in the war zones of Ukraine and the Middle East. Trump has indicated he will cut aid to Kyiv\u2019s battle against the Russian invasion.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE: Fox News projects Trump victory in Pennsylvania\n\n\n\n: Trump wins North Carolina, Georgia, narrowing Harris\u2019 possible path to victory\n\n\n\n: Trump takes lead in US presidential race but battleground states still too close to call",

        "text": "American Public Disapproval of the Israel-Hamas War and the U.S. Presidential Election\nThe U.S. presidential election, a rematch between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, is in full swing. President Biden, who has remained unpopular throughout his term domestically, is caught in a \u2018two wars\u2019 dilemma internationally. Some argue that uncertainty has increased over President Biden\u2019s re-election due to a series of foreign policy failures in the Ukraine and Gaza wars. This means that, excluding the Iraq War, which turned into a severe social problem in America in 2008, foreign issues might be an important factor in the U.S. presidential election. This is an interesting claim as it has never been before.\nAs the war between Israel and Hamas continues, the claim that foreign policy issues will become critical in the 2024 presidential election needs to be closely examined. This Issue Brief analyzes multiple polling data to estimate the impact of foreign issues, such as the Israel-Hamas war, on Americans\u2019 vote choices.\nAccording to several polls published to date, some young progressive voters, who are traditional supporters of the Democratic Party, disapprove President Biden\u2019s response to the Israel-Hamas war and tend to withdraw their support as a result.\n\nFigure 1. Americans\u2019 view of the U.S. response to the Israel-Hamas war (%)\n\nIn December 2023, the Pew Research Center revealed that only 35% of Americans approved President Biden\u2019s response to the Israel-Hamas war (41% disapprove, 24% don\u2019t know). The older people are more likely to support President Biden. For example, 50% of those over 65 supported his response to the war, while 46% and 43% of young people in their 20s and 30s, respectively, viewed it negatively (see Figure 1). In particular, only 19% of people in their 20s supported President Biden\u2019s response to the war. It is clear that there is a dissatisfaction with President Biden\u2019s response to the war, especially among young people.\nAccording to another survey by Pew Research Center conducted in April 2024, young Americans sympathized more with Palestinians than with Israelis (18~29 years old: 33%), and 60% favored Palestinians (46% favored Israelis). This was noticeable among young people who support the Democratic Party (sympathy: 47%, favorability: 76%). Pro-Israel views are still common among Americans, but in the late 2000s, the perception of Palestine among young people (18~29 years old) had clearly been improved.\nThis is because young people more easily and frequently encounter foreign policy issues through social media and are more likely to sympathize with the humanitarian crisis caused by war. They grew up with exposure to movements such as \u2018Occupy Wall Street\u2019, \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019, and students\u2019 gun control campaigns. As civilian casualties rapidly increased in Gaza, a pro-Palestinian anti-war movement was organized around 50 campuses, including Columbia University, the University of Michigan, and UCLA.\n\nHowever, the approval rating for President Biden did not decline. In fact, President Biden\u2019s approval rating has remained around 40% since falling in the third quarter of 2021 and has remained unchanged since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war in October 2023.\n\nFigure 2. President Biden\u2019s approval rating (%)\n\nAccording to another survey by Pew Research Center conducted in April 2024, young Americans sympathized more with Palestinians than with Israelis (18~29 years old: 33%), and 60% favored Palestinians (46% favored Israelis). This was noticeable among young people who support the Democratic Party (sympathy: 47%, favorability: 76%). Pro-Israel views are still common among Americans, but in the late 2000s, the perception of Palestine among young people (18~29 years old) had clearly been improved.\nIn the early days of the war, the Biden administration opposed a ceasefire and sided with Israel, even though civilian casualties increased due to Israel\u2019s massive bombing and collective punishment of the Gaza Strip to destroy Hamas. As a result, turmoil was detected among the young, progressive Democratic Party supporters who contributed to President Biden\u2019s election in 2020. Also, starting in October 2023, many Arab and Muslim community leaders, beginning in Minnesota, began campaigning to abandon and defeat President Biden, who did not call for a ceasefire in the war. During the 2020 presidential election, President Biden won seven swing states, including Minnesota, Michigan, Arizona, Wisconsin, Florida, Georgia, Nevada, and Pennsylvania, where campaigns against him are currently taking place.\n\nTable 1. President Biden\u2019s rating for his handling of major policy issues (%)\n\nWhen we see the approvals of President Biden and his administration by specific policies, low scores were observed in foreign policy and responses to the Middle East situation. According to Table 1, which summarizes a Gallup survey in March 2024, 46% and 42% approved the environmental and energy policies, respectively, exceeding the overall average (40%). On the other hand, the economy and diplomacy fell below the overall average, with only 37% and 33%, respectively, giving an approval. The lowest approval was in President Biden\u2019s response to Middle East issues between Israel and Palestine (approval: 27%).\nIndeed, the general American voter does not consider external issues as a determining factor when deciding their vote choices. In April 2024, Americans\u2019 major national issues were inflation (35%), immigration (35%), economy and jobs (26%), gun control (17%), crime rate (15%), and healthcare (15%), abortion rights (14%), while only 5% each said foreign policy and the war between Israel and Hamas were important. In Seoul, in May 2024, Mike Pompeo, who served as Secretary of State during the Trump administration, also said that in the presidential election, inflation and immigration at the southern border, rather than external issues, would be decisive in voters\u2019 choices.\nThe Iraq War was a key issue in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. However, rather than an external issue, this was due to the serious social problems caused by post-traumatic stress disorder among veterans at the time. The decisive factor in President Carter\u2019s failure to be re-elected in 1980 was the failure of economic policy due to high inflation rather than the foreign policy crisis.\nAs a result of the analysis, the observation that the Israel-Hamas war ahead of this year\u2019s presidential election made President Biden\u2019s re-election uncertain was not clearly supported in the polling data. When deciding which candidate to support, American voters viewed domestic issues such as immigration, inflation, the economy and jobs, gun control, crime rate, healthcare, and abortion rights as more important than external issues. In addition, progressive young people also responded in a public opinion poll, saying, \u201cI dislike both candidates, but I have greater antipathy toward candidate Trump.\u201d\n\nAccording to public opinion polls so far, young American voters have given negative evaluations to the U.S. response to the Israel-Hamas war, but President Biden\u2019s approval rating has not declined since the war. Although they criticized President Biden\u2019s policy toward the Middle East, it is hard to assume that young constituents have completely withdrawn their support for him. Currently, it seems unlikely that young people\u2019s evaluations of specific external issues will emerge as a key variable that will determine the future U.S. presidential election.\nMoreover, the Biden administration sharply changed its position to support an immediate ceasefire, expand humanitarian aid to Palestine, and increase pressure on Israel. As a result, the anti-war movement among young people, which was believed to be a negative factor in President Biden\u2019s re-election bid, is also expected to subside after March 2024.\nPresident Biden criticized the anti-war movement as anti-Semitic but expressed a neutral stance in support of freedom of expression in universities. Accordingly, the anti-war movement appears to have lost momentum and is faltering. Anti-war public sentiment has also weakened, and according to a May 2024 survey by The Economist and YouGov, only 28% of Americans said they supported anti-war protests (47% opposed). The reasons for the decline in approval of the anti-war movement is that it is increasingly viewed as having strayed from its initial cause \u2014criticism of Hamas \u2014and as inciting violence on campus.\nIn this regard, the prediction that the war between Israel and Hamas will have a detrimental effect on President Biden in the U.S. presidential election seems premature.\n\n\nCenter for Regional Studies\nDr. JANG Ji-Hyang is a Principal Fellow and director of the Center for Regional Studies at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies.

President Biden, who has remained unpopular throughout his term domestically, is caught in a \u2018two wars\u2019 dilemma internationally. Some argue that uncertainty has increased over President Biden\u2019s re-election due to a series of foreign policy failures in the Ukraine and Gaza wars.

Americans\u2019 view of the U.S. response to the Israel-Hamas war (%)\n\n\u00a0\nIn December 2023, the Pew Research Center revealed that only 35% of Americans approved President Biden\u2019s response to the Israel-Hamas war (41% disapprove, 24% don\u2019t know). The older people are more likely to support President Biden. For example, 50% of those over 65 supported his response to the war, while 46% and 43% of young people in their 20s and 30s, respectively, viewed it negatively (see Figure 1). In particular, only 19% of people in their 20s supported President Biden\u2019s response to the war. It is clear that there is a dissatisfaction with President Biden\u2019s response to the war, especially among young people.\nAccording to another survey by Pew Research Center conducted in April 2024, young Americans sympathized more with Palestinians than with Israelis (18~29 years old: 33%), and 60% favored Palestinians (46% favored Israelis). This was noticeable among young people who support the Democratic Party (sympathy: 47%, favorability: 76%). Pro-Israel views are still common among Americans, but in the late 2000s, the perception of Palestine among young people (18~29 years old) had clearly been improved.\nThis is because young people more easily and frequently encounter foreign policy issues through social media and are more likely to sympathize with the humanitarian crisis caused by war.

In fact, President Biden\u2019s approval rating has remained around 40% since falling in the third quarter of 2021 and has remained unchanged since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war in October 2023.\n\u00a0\nFigure 2.

During the 2020 presidential election, President Biden won seven swing states, including Minnesota, Michigan, Arizona, Wisconsin, Florida, Georgia, Nevada, and Pennsylvania, where campaigns against him are currently taking place.\n\u00a0\nTable 1.

Election.pdf \n\n\nsocial share\n\n Facebook\n Twitter\n\nAmericans\u2019 Views on U.S. Policy Toward the Israel-Hamas War: The Turmoil Among Young Progressive Democrats \n\u00a0\nThe U.S. presidential election, a rematch between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, is in full swing. President Biden, who has remained unpopular throughout his term domestically, is caught in a \u2018two wars\u2019 dilemma internationally. Some argue that uncertainty has increased over President Biden\u2019s re-election due to a series of foreign policy failures in the Ukraine and Gaza wars. This means that, excluding the Iraq War, which turned into a severe social problem in America in 2008, foreign issues might be an important factor in the U.S. presidential election. This is an interesting claim as it has never been before.\nAs the war between Israel and Hamas continues, the claim that foreign policy issues will become critical in the 2024 presidential election needs to be closely examined. This Issue Brief analyzes multiple polling data to estimate the impact of foreign issues, such as the Israel-Hamas war, on Americans\u2019 vote choices.\nAccording to several polls published to date, some young progressive voters, who are traditional supporters of the Democratic Party, disapprove President Biden\u2019s response to the Israel-Hamas war and tend to withdraw their support as a result.\n\u00a0\nFigure 1. Americans\u2019 view of the U.S. response to the Israel-Hamas war (%)\n\n\u00a0\nIn December 2023, the Pew Research Center revealed that only 35% of Americans approved President Biden\u2019s response to the Israel-Hamas war (41% disapprove, 24% don\u2019t know). The older people are more likely to support President Biden. For example, 50% of those over 65 supported his response to the war, while 46% and 43% of young people in their 20s and 30s, respectively, viewed it negatively (see Figure 1). In particular, only 19% of people in their 20s supported President Biden\u2019s response to the war. It is clear that there is a dissatisfaction with President Biden\u2019s response to the war, especially among young people.\nAccording to another survey by Pew Research Center conducted in April 2024, young Americans sympathized more with Palestinians than with Israelis (18~29 years old: 33%), and 60% favored Palestinians (46% favored Israelis). This was noticeable among young people who support the Democratic Party (sympathy: 47%, favorability: 76%). Pro-Israel views are still common among Americans, but in the late 2000s, the perception of Palestine among young people (18~29 years old) had clearly been improved.\nThis is because young people more easily and frequently encounter foreign policy issues through social media and are more likely to sympathize with the humanitarian crisis caused by war. They grew up with exposure to movements such as \u2018Occupy Wall Street\u2019, \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019, and students\u2019 gun control campaigns. As civilian casualties rapidly increased in Gaza, a pro-Palestinian anti-war movement was organized around 50 campuses, including Columbia University, the University of Michigan, and UCLA.\n\u00a0\nPresident Biden\u2019s Approval Rating Unchanged Despite the Israel-Hamas War\n\u00a0\nHowever, the approval rating for President Biden did not decline. In fact, President Biden\u2019s approval rating has remained around 40% since falling in the third quarter of 2021 and has remained unchanged since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war in October 2023.\n\u00a0\nFigure 2. President Biden\u2019s approval rating (%)\n\n\u00a0\nAccording to another survey by Pew Research Center conducted in April 2024, young Americans sympathized more with Palestinians than with Israelis (18~29 years old: 33%), and 60% favored Palestinians (46% favored Israelis). This was noticeable among young people who support the Democratic Party (sympathy: 47%, favorability: 76%). Pro-Israel views are still common among Americans, but in the late 2000s, the perception of Palestine among young people (18~29 years old) had clearly been improved.\nIn the early days of the war, the Biden administration opposed a ceasefire and sided with Israel, even though civilian casualties increased due to Israel\u2019s massive bombing and collective punishment of the Gaza Strip to destroy Hamas. As a result, turmoil was detected among the young, progressive Democratic Party supporters who contributed to President Biden\u2019s election in 2020. Also, starting in October 2023, many Arab and Muslim community leaders, beginning in Minnesota, began campaigning to abandon and defeat President Biden, who did not call for a ceasefire in the war. During the 2020 presidential election, President Biden won seven swing states, including Minnesota, Michigan, Arizona, Wisconsin, Florida, Georgia, Nevada, and Pennsylvania, where campaigns against him are currently taking place.\n\u00a0\nTable 1. President Biden\u2019s rating for his handling of major policy issues (%)\n\n\u00a0\nWhen we see the approvals of President Biden and his administration by specific policies, low scores were observed in foreign policy and responses to the Middle East situation. According to Table 1, which summarizes a Gallup survey in March 2024, 46% and 42% approved the environmental and energy policies, respectively, exceeding the overall average (40%). On the other hand, the economy and diplomacy fell below the overall average, with only 37% and 33%, respectively, giving an approval. The lowest approval was in President Biden\u2019s response to Middle East issues between Israel and Palestine (approval: 27%).\nIndeed, the general American voter does not consider external issues as a determining factor when deciding their vote choices. In April 2024, Americans\u2019 major national issues were inflation (35%), immigration (35%), economy and jobs (26%), gun control (17%), crime rate (15%), and healthcare (15%), abortion rights (14%), while only 5% each said foreign policy and the war between Israel and Hamas were important. In Seoul, in May 2024, Mike Pompeo, who served as Secretary of State during the Trump administration, also said that in the presidential election, inflation and immigration at the southern border, rather than external issues, would be decisive in voters\u2019 choices.\nThe Iraq War was a key issue in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. However, rather than an external issue, this was due to the serious social problems caused by post-traumatic stress disorder among veterans at the time. The decisive factor in President Carter\u2019s failure to be re-elected in 1980 was the failure of economic policy due to high inflation rather than the foreign policy crisis.\nAs a result of the analysis, the observation that the Israel-Hamas war ahead of this year\u2019s presidential election made President Biden\u2019s re-election uncertain was not clearly supported in the polling data. When deciding which candidate to support, American voters viewed domestic issues such as immigration, inflation, the economy and jobs, gun control, crime rate, healthcare, and abortion rights as more important than external issues. In addition, progressive young people also responded in a public opinion poll, saying, \u201cI dislike both candidates, but I have greater antipathy toward candidate Trump.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Prospects of the Anti-War Movement and Young Voters\n\u00a0\nAccording to public opinion polls so far, young American voters have given negative evaluations to the U.S. response to the Israel-Hamas war, but President Biden\u2019s approval rating has not declined since the war. Although they criticized President Biden\u2019s policy toward the Middle East, it is hard to assume that young constituents have completely withdrawn their support for him. Currently, it seems unlikely that young people\u2019s evaluations of specific external issues will emerge as a key variable that will determine the future U.S. presidential election.\nMoreover, the Biden administration sharply changed its position to support an immediate ceasefire, expand humanitarian aid to Palestine, and increase pressure on Israel. As a result, the anti-war movement among young people, which was believed to be a negative factor in President Biden\u2019s re-election bid, is also expected to subside after March 2024.\nPresident Biden criticized the anti-war movement as anti-Semitic but expressed a neutral stance in support of freedom of expression in universities. Accordingly, the anti-war movement appears to have lost momentum and is faltering. Anti-war public sentiment has also weakened, and according to a May 2024 survey by The Economist and YouGov, only 28% of Americans said they supported anti-war protests (47% opposed). The reasons for the decline in approval of the anti-war movement is that it is increasingly viewed as having strayed from its initial cause \u2014criticism of Hamas \u2014and as inciting violence on campus.\nIn this regard, the prediction that the war between Israel and Hamas will have a detrimental effect on President Biden in the U.S. presidential election seems premature.\n\u00a0\n\nThis article is an English Summary of Asan Issue Brief (2024-16).\n(\u2018\ubbf8\uad6d \ub0b4 \uc774\uc2a4\ub77c\uc5d8\u2219\ud558\ub9c8\uc2a4 \uc804\uc7c1 \ubc18\ub300 \uc5ec\ub860\uacfc \ubbf8 \ub300\uc120\u2019, https://www.asaninst.org/?p=94121)\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAbout Experts\n\n\n\nJang Ji-Hyang\nCenter for Regional Studies\nDr. JANG Ji-Hyang is a Principal Fellow and director of the Center for Regional Studies at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies.

As civilian casualties rapidly increased in Gaza, a pro-Palestinian anti-war movement was organized around 50 campuses, including Columbia University, the University of Michigan, and UCLA.\n\u00a0\nPresident Biden\u2019s Approval Rating Unchanged Despite the Israel-Hamas War\n\u00a0\nHowever, the approval rating for President Biden did not decline. In fact, President Biden\u2019s approval rating has remained around 40% since falling in the third quarter of 2021 and has remained unchanged since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war in October 2023.\n\u00a0\nFigure 2. President Biden\u2019s approval rating (%)\n\n\u00a0\nAccording to another survey by Pew Research Center conducted in April 2024, young Americans sympathized more with Palestinians than with Israelis (18~29 years old: 33%), and 60% favored Palestinians (46% favored Israelis). This was noticeable among young people who support the Democratic Party (sympathy: 47%, favorability: 76%). Pro-Israel views are still common among Americans, but in the late 2000s, the perception of Palestine among young people (18~29 years old) had clearly been improved.\nIn the early days of the war, the Biden administration opposed a ceasefire and sided with Israel, even though civilian casualties increased due to Israel\u2019s massive bombing and collective punishment of the Gaza Strip to destroy Hamas. As a result, turmoil was detected among the young, progressive Democratic Party supporters who contributed to President Biden\u2019s election in 2020. Also, starting in October 2023, many Arab and Muslim community leaders, beginning in Minnesota, began campaigning to abandon and defeat President Biden, who did not call for a ceasefire in the war. During the 2020 presidential election, President Biden won seven swing states, including Minnesota, Michigan, Arizona, Wisconsin, Florida, Georgia, Nevada, and Pennsylvania, where campaigns against him are currently taking place.\n\u00a0\nTable 1. President Biden\u2019s rating for his handling of major policy issues (%)\n\n\u00a0\nWhen we see the approvals of President Biden and his administration by specific policies, low scores were observed in foreign policy and responses to the Middle East situation. According to Table 1, which summarizes a Gallup survey in March 2024, 46% and 42% approved the environmental and energy policies, respectively, exceeding the overall average (40%). On the other hand, the economy and diplomacy fell below the overall average, with only 37% and 33%, respectively, giving an approval. The lowest approval was in President Biden\u2019s response to Middle East issues between Israel and Palestine (approval: 27%).\nIndeed, the general American voter does not consider external issues as a determining factor when deciding their vote choices. In April 2024, Americans\u2019 major national issues were inflation (35%), immigration (35%), economy and jobs (26%), gun control (17%), crime rate (15%), and healthcare (15%), abortion rights (14%), while only 5% each said foreign policy and the war between Israel and Hamas were important. In Seoul, in May 2024, Mike Pompeo, who served as Secretary of State during the Trump administration, also said that in the presidential election, inflation and immigration at the southern border, rather than external issues, would be decisive in voters\u2019 choices.\nThe Iraq War was a key issue in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. However, rather than an external issue, this was due to the serious social problems caused by post-traumatic stress disorder among veterans at the time. The decisive factor in President Carter\u2019s failure to be re-elected in 1980 was the failure of economic policy due to high inflation rather than the foreign policy crisis.\nAs a result of the analysis, the observation that the Israel-Hamas war ahead of this year\u2019s presidential election made President Biden\u2019s re-election uncertain was not clearly supported in the polling data. When deciding which candidate to support, American voters viewed domestic issues such as immigration, inflation, the economy and jobs, gun control, crime rate, healthcare, and abortion rights as more important than external issues. In addition, progressive young people also responded in a public opinion poll, saying, \u201cI dislike both candidates, but I have greater antipathy toward candidate Trump.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Prospects of the Anti-War Movement and Young Voters\n\u00a0\nAccording to public opinion polls so far, young American voters have given negative evaluations to the U.S. response to the Israel-Hamas war, but President Biden\u2019s approval rating has not declined since the war. Although they criticized President Biden\u2019s policy toward the Middle East, it is hard to assume that young constituents have completely withdrawn their support for him. Currently, it seems unlikely that young people\u2019s evaluations of specific external issues will emerge as a key variable that will determine the future U.S. presidential election.\nMoreover, the Biden administration sharply changed its position to support an immediate ceasefire, expand humanitarian aid to Palestine, and increase pressure on Israel. As a result, the anti-war movement among young people, which was believed to be a negative factor in President Biden\u2019s re-election bid, is also expected to subside after March 2024.\nPresident Biden criticized the anti-war movement as anti-Semitic but expressed a neutral stance in support of freedom of expression in universities. Accordingly, the anti-war movement appears to have lost momentum and is faltering. Anti-war public sentiment has also weakened, and according to a May 2024 survey by The Economist and YouGov, only 28% of Americans said they supported anti-war protests (47% opposed). The reasons for the decline in approval of the anti-war movement is that it is increasingly viewed as having strayed from its initial cause \u2014criticism of Hamas \u2014and as inciting violence on campus.\nIn this regard, the prediction that the war between Israel and Hamas will have a detrimental effect on President Biden in the U.S. presidential election seems premature.\n\u00a0\n\nThis article is an English Summary of Asan Issue Brief (2024-16).\n(\u2018\ubbf8\uad6d \ub0b4 \uc774\uc2a4\ub77c\uc5d8\u2219\ud558\ub9c8\uc2a4 \uc804\uc7c1 \ubc18\ub300 \uc5ec\ub860\uacfc \ubbf8 \ub300\uc120\u2019, https://www.asaninst.org/?p=94121)\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAbout Experts\n\n\n\nJang Ji-Hyang\nCenter for Regional Studies\nDr. JANG Ji-Hyang is a Principal Fellow and director of the Center for Regional Studies at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies.

President Biden, who has remained unpopular throughout his term domestically, is caught in a \u2018two wars\u2019 dilemma internationally. Some argue that uncertainty has increased over President Biden\u2019s re-election due to a series of foreign policy failures in the Ukraine and Gaza wars. This means that, excluding the Iraq War, which turned into a severe social problem in America in 2008, foreign issues might be an important factor in the U.S. presidential election. This is an interesting claim as it has never been before.\nAs the war between Israel and Hamas continues, the claim that foreign policy issues will become critical in the 2024 presidential election needs to be closely examined. This Issue Brief analyzes multiple polling data to estimate the impact of foreign issues, such as the Israel-Hamas war, on Americans\u2019 vote choices.\nAccording to several polls published to date, some young progressive voters, who are traditional supporters of the Democratic Party, disapprove President Biden\u2019s response to the Israel-Hamas war and tend to withdraw their support as a result.\n\u00a0\nFigure 1. Americans\u2019 view of the U.S. response to the Israel-Hamas war (%)\n\n\u00a0\nIn December 2023, the Pew Research Center revealed that only 35% of Americans approved President Biden\u2019s response to the Israel-Hamas war (41% disapprove, 24% don\u2019t know). The older people are more likely to support President Biden. For example, 50% of those over 65 supported his response to the war, while 46% and 43% of young people in their 20s and 30s, respectively, viewed it negatively (see Figure 1). In particular, only 19% of people in their 20s supported President Biden\u2019s response to the war. It is clear that there is a dissatisfaction with President Biden\u2019s response to the war, especially among young people.\nAccording to another survey by Pew Research Center conducted in April 2024, young Americans sympathized more with Palestinians than with Israelis (18~29 years old: 33%), and 60% favored Palestinians (46% favored Israelis).

Anti-war public sentiment has also weakened, and according to a May 2024 survey by The Economist and YouGov, only 28% of Americans said they supported anti-war protests (47% opposed). The reasons for the decline in approval of the anti-war movement is that it is increasingly viewed as having strayed from its initial cause \u2014criticism of Hamas \u2014and as inciting violence on campus.\nIn this regard, the prediction that the war between Israel and Hamas will have a detrimental effect on President Biden in the U.S. presidential election seems premature.\n\u00a0\n\nThis article is an English Summary of Asan Issue Brief (2024-16).\n(\u2018\ubbf8\uad6d \ub0b4 \uc774\uc2a4\ub77c\uc5d8\u2219\ud558\ub9c8\uc2a4 \uc804\uc7c1 \ubc18\ub300 \uc5ec\ub860\uacfc \ubbf8 \ub300\uc120\u2019, https://www.asaninst.org/?p=94121)\nsocial share\n\n Facebook\n Twitter\nThis article is an English Summary of Asan Issue Brief (2024-16).\n(\u2018\ubbf8\uad6d \ub0b4 \uc774\uc2a4\ub77c\uc5d8\u2219\ud558\ub9c8\uc2a4 \uc804\uc7c1 \ubc18\ub300 \uc5ec\ub860\uacfc \ubbf8 \ub300\uc120\u2019, https://www.asaninst.org/?p=94121)\n\nAbout Experts\n\n\n\nJang Ji-Hyang\nCenter for Regional Studies\nDr. JANG Ji-Hyang is a Principal Fellow and director of the Center for Regional Studies at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies.

In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want,\u2019\u201d Trump remembered saying. \u201cYou got to pay. You got to pay your bills.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nA Trump return to the Oval Office means that an alliance like NATO, which is built fundamentally on trust, will suffer because people will not be able to trust Donald Trump to defend them if and when the emergency arises.\"\n\nIt was a stunning admission that was seen as a shot across the bow to European allies \u2014 and the foreign policy establishment, including people like former Obama-era Ambassador to NATO, Ivo Daalder.\n\n\u201cThe statement was less about the threat that allowing Russia to do whatever it wanted would mean for the countries involved and more about what it says about Trump's view of alliances,\u201d Daalder said.\n\nThe former president\u2019s criticism of NATO \u2014 and the U.S. allies who are part of the alliance \u2014 is not new. He often referred to the spending targets outlined in charter agreements as requirements and derided countries for not paying enough.\n\nHe\u2019s been critical of western allies and cozied up to authoritarian leaders, like Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin and Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n.\n\nBut Daalder\u2019s larger point, which is being echoed across party lines, is that Trump is reducing the importance of a 75-year alliance to the U.S. being an army for hire \u2014 and that NATO isn\u2019t something that is fundamental to U.S. security.\n\n\u201cA Trump return to the Oval Office means that an alliance like NATO, which is built fundamentally on trust, will suffer because people will not be able to trust Donald Trump to defend them if and when the emergency arises,\u201d Daalder said.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWhat is new is the second generation approach to foreign policy by this battle-hardened Trump who has both the experience in the White House and a chip on his shoulder to take what he started in his first administration \u2014 and take it even further.\n\nNow, Trump has promised to fundamentally reevaluate the NATO alliance, reshape global trade and overhaul the Pentagon, State Department and intelligence services.\n\nHe has largely avoided explaining how he\u2019d handle the conflicts in Europe and the Middle East, yet claims he can settle the war in Ukraine in 24 hours.\n\nForeign policy 2.0\n\nHe would be like a child without any parents to stop him from doing really bad things.\u201d\n\nFrom the campaign trail, Trump\u2019s raised concerns that the U.S. is paying too much to support Ukraine.\n\nHe\u2019s promised again to withdraw from the Paris Climate Accords.\n\nAnd he has floated the idea of a 10% tax on imports from all countries and a much higher tax on China, echoing at rallies that \u201cChina is eating our lunch,\u201d to groans and applause.\n\nJohn Simon, who served as ambassador to the African Union in the Bush administration, worries Trump will dismantle key tenets of American foreign policy, including standing up to totalitarian aggression.\n\n\u201cMy great fear is that a second Trump administration would have all the hallmarks of his first administration without any of the guardrails that were provided by the more experienced foreign policy folks who are around him,\u201d Simon said. \u201cHe would be like a child without any parents to stop him from doing really bad things.\u201d\n\nThe view from Europe\n\ntoggle caption Peter Nicholls/AP/Reuters Pool\n\nDepending on who you ask \u2014 and where \u2014 Trump\u2019s return can elicit excitement, trepidation and even fear across the European continent.\n\nNathalie Tocci, a former top EU foreign policy adviser, says Trump had a \u201cfairly unifying effect on Europe,\u201d during his first term.\n\nAt the time, leaders rallied together during his first administration as the U.S. seemed to check out from the transatlantic relationship.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut the political landscape changed. European parliamentary elections this week saw a rise in far right parties.\n\nTrump\u2019s election could inflame those divisions. And Tocci said the potential of a second term has some keeping their heads in the sand, unable or unwilling to face that prospect again.\n\n\u201cSo it's more like, you know, this kind of fear of something that is happening and you think is going to happen and you're more and more convinced that it will happen,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it's so scary that you just prefer not to think about it.\u201d\n\nWithout mentioning Trump\u2019s name, President Biden nodded to some of those concerns while traveling in France last week for the 80th anniversary of D-Day.\n\n\u201cIsolationism was not the answer 80 years ago and is not the answer today,\u201d Biden said.\n\nTrump remains unconcerned\n\nI often tell European colleagues there is more continuity to U.S. policy than we sometimes suggest because we personalize [politics].\"\n\nTrump has dismissed the criticism, blaming Biden and the foreign policy establishment for creating a more dangerous world.\n\nBryan Lanza, a former Trump aide who remains close to the campaign, says Trump was right to challenge NATO members to step up their defense contributions.\n\n\u201cThe criticisms that exist here from the foreign policy community, you know, those are criticisms because they don't want change,\u201d Lanza said.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to predict Trump\u2019s exact policies, which has increased feelings of uncertainty.\n\nStill, Heather Conley, who worked on European issues in the Bush State Department, says it\u2019s important to remember that many of the policies will be the same whether it\u2019s Biden or Trump.\n\n\u201cI often tell European colleagues there is more continuity to U.S. policy than we sometimes suggest because we personalize this,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd these personalities certainly have different approaches to allies very specifically.\u201d\n\nAs examples, she points to similarities in Biden and Trump\u2019s trade agenda and how Biden maintained the Abraham Accords, a key Trump victory.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBoth leaders kept a strong relationship with Israel and a hawkish approach to China.\n\nDespite the differences in personalities oftentimes the status quo wins out over rhetoric.\n\n\u201cUnderneath, sometimes the policy can look awfully similar,\u201d Conley explained. \u201cAnd so they\u2019re going to have to deal with the substance of that - with some exceptions - regardless of who is in the White House.\u201d",

        "text": "1 in 10 eligible U.S. voters say they can\u2019t easily show proof of their citizenship\n1 in 10 eligible U.S. voters say they can\u2019t easily show proof of their citizenship\n\ntoggle caption Brynn Anderson/AP\n\nTop Republicans are lining up behind a proposal to require proof of U.S. citizenship for voter registration in federal elections. But for millions of U.S. citizens, it\u2019s not easy to prove their citizenship with a document.\n\nAbout 1 in 10 adult citizens, or 21.3 million eligible voters, say they either do not have or could not quickly find in order to show the next day their U.S. birth certificate, passport, naturalization certificate or certificate of citizenship, according to results released Tuesday from a national survey.\n\nThe new findings, shared first with NPR, also show disparities by race, ethnicity and political affiliation.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nU.S. citizens of color are more likely than white citizens, who do not identify as Latino, to say they lack citizenship documents (3% of people of color compared to 1% of white people) or can\u2019t readily access them (11% of people of color vs. 8% of white people). Independents are more likely to report that they don\u2019t have documents (4%) compared to Democrats (2%) and Republicans (1%). They are also more likely to report not having ready document access (13%) than Democrats (10%) and Republicans (7%).\n\nThe results fall in line with longstanding concerns among many election experts and voting rights advocates, who have warned that proposals \u2014 including the new Republican-backed bill in the U.S. House of Representatives \u2014 to require people to show documentary proof of citizenship when signing up to vote in federal elections could risk keeping eligible voters from casting ballots.\n\n\u201cWe've got a huge crisis on our hands when we think about the people who lack the documents required to prove their citizenship and identity. And we really need to think about the far-reaching implications for that when it comes to economic and social and voting access,\u201d says Lauren Kunis, executive director of VoteRiders, a voting rights organization focused on voter ID issues that sponsored the survey alongside groups including the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University\u2019s law school and the University of Maryland\u2019s Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement.\n\nHow election officials verify citizenship without documents\n\nFederal law requires states to accept registration forms that call for applicants to swear under penalty of perjury that they are U.S. citizens and review this warning: \u201cIf I have provided false information, I may be fined, imprisoned, or (if not a U.S. citizen) deported from or refused entry to the United States.\u201d Most states also use applicants\u2019 driver\u2019s license or Social Security numbers to check people\u2019s citizenship information in government agency databases.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nStill, a group of House Republicans rolled out a bill last month to require all eligible voters to show documentary proof of citizenship when registering to vote in federal elections. Applicants who cannot provide an acceptable document would be able to sign a sworn statement about their U.S. citizenship and submit \u201cother evidence\u201d to a state official, who would decide whether the applicant has \u201csufficiently established\u201d citizenship.\n\nWhile the proposal is unlikely to become law in this divided Congress, the GOP lawmakers say they want to address the rare and illegal practice of non-U.S. citizens casting ballots for federal races \u2014 a talking point that former President Donald Trump and his supporters have long boosted.\n\n\u201cWe all know intuitively that a lot of illegals are voting in federal elections, but it's not been something that is easily provable. We don't have that number,\u201d said House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, at a press conference about the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act.\n\nNumbers that are available, however, indicate that noncitizens cast ballots in exceedingly small numbers in federal elections.\n\n\u201cBy making these requirements more strict, you're more likely to catch people who actually do have the documents or are able to verify their identity but, just because of happenstance or some quirk, are unable to do so at the very moment when they need to in order to vote,\u201d says Bernard Fraga, an associate professor of political science at Emory University, who has researched the impact of voter ID laws.\n\nWhy showing proof of citizenship can be a hurdle\n\nThe latest results from the national survey, which was conducted last September and October, are a reminder that the financial and logistical hurdles to getting a citizenship document or keeping one on hand should not be overlooked, Fraga adds.\n\n\u201cI think that the broader story that we see here is the idea that what for many Americans doesn't seem like that big of an issue \u2014 demonstrating that you're a citizen \u2014 for some Americans is actually enough of a hurdle to make voting just inaccessible,\u201d Fraga says.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nKunis, VoteRiders\u2019 executive director, says her organization has helped eligible voters overcome a range of barriers to obtaining citizenship documents. They may be stored inside a bank\u2019s safe deposit box or tucked away at a family member\u2019s home in another town or state. Some people may need support navigating a \u201cbureaucratic doom loop\u201d when trying to replace faded certificates, Kunis adds.\n\nAnd for more than 3.8 million adult citizens, or about 2% of eligible voters, there\u2019s no document to find at all, according to the survey\u2019s estimates. That includes birth certificates.\n\n\u201cOlder Americans and Black Americans, particularly in the South, are more likely to have been born outside of a hospital setting, meaning they didn't receive a birth certificate automatically,\u201d Kunis points out.\n\n\n\nWhat is driving these calls for proof of citizenship?\n\nWhile the survey found that requiring proof of citizenship would likely disproportionately affect historically underrepresented groups, including people of color and political independents, Michael Hanmer, a professor of government and politics, who directs the University of Maryland\u2019s Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement, notes that the results also show that these requirements would still affect other groups.\n\n\u201cThere's not a whole lot of evidence that, for example, stricter laws about proof of citizenship are going to solve problems with fraud because there really aren't problems with fraud,\u201d Hanmer says. \u201cThat leads you to wonder, \u2018Well, what might be going on here?\u2019 And if there's political reasons behind it, then our results suggest that that should be rethought because this is not going to just hit one group. It's going to hit everybody.\u201d\n\nIn New Hampshire, Republican-led proposals would change the state\u2019s election laws to require proof of citizenship when people register to vote in the state for the first time. Federal courts struck down a similar Kansas state law \u2014 which was backed by former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a Republican who is the state\u2019s current attorney general and once served as vice chair of Trump\u2019s short-lived voter fraud commission \u2014 for violating the 14th Amendment and the National Voter Registration Act.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAnd there is an ongoing legal fight over Arizona\u2019s now-blocked proof-of-citizenship requirements that ban registered voters who have not provided proof from voting in presidential elections or by mail for any federal office. The Republican National Committee, along with Arizona\u2019s top GOP state lawmakers, are appealing a federal judge\u2019s ruling that found the National Voter Registration Act preempts the state\u2019s restrictions.\n\nWith no evidence that noncitizens are voting in numbers significant enough to sway election outcomes, Sean Morales-Doyle \u2014 director of the voting rights program at the Brennan Center for Justice, which advocates for expanded voter access \u2014 says calls to enact requirements like these are fueled instead by baseless claims of widespread voter fraud from Trump and his allies.\n\n\u201cThey're trying to lay the groundwork for the ability to call the outcome into question if they aren't happy about the outcome later,\u201d Morales-Doyle says. \u201cWe've seen this playbook before and we're seeing it play out again.\u201d\n\nEdited by Benjamin Swasey",

        "text": "Trump and Biden are tied in 538's new election forecast\nToday 538 published our official forecast for the 2024 presidential election. The model builds on our general election polling averages by asking not just what our best guess is about who is leading the presidential race today, but what range of outcomes are possible for the actual election in November. At least once per day, we'll rerun our simulations of the election with the latest data, so bookmark our interactive and check back often.\n\nAt launch, our forecast shows President Joe Biden locked in a practically tied race with former President Donald Trump, both in the Electoral College and national popular vote. Specifically, our model reckons Biden has a 53-in-100 chance of winning the election, meaning he wins in slightly more than half of our model's simulations of how the election could unfold. However, Trump still has a 47-in-100 chance, so this election could still very much go either way. The range of realistic* Electoral College outcomes generated by our forecasting model stretches from 132 to 445 electoral votes for Biden \u2014 a testament to how much things could change by November (and how off the polls could be).\n\nOur model is brand new this year, with tons of bells and whistles and modern statistical tools that you can read all about in our methodology post. Here, I'll give you the non-wonky version of how the forecast works, offer a few tips on how to read it and explain why we think forecasts are valuable in the first place.\n\nHow we forecast\n\nTo forecast the election, we rely primarily on polls asking voters whom they support. However, our forecast also incorporates various economic and political indicators that aren\u2019t related to polling but can be used to make rough predictions for the election. For example, we have calculated an index of economic growth and optimism on every day since 1944, gathered historical approval ratings for every president since Franklin D. Roosevelt and derived a formula for predicting state election outcomes using these and other local factors. We also tested whether incumbent presidents do better when they run for reelection (they do) and whether all of these factors are less predictive of voters\u2019 choices when political polarization is high (they are).\n\nRight now, Trump leads Biden in most polls of the swing states that will decide the election, but the \u201cfundamentals\u201d favor Biden. The combined polls-plus-fundamentals forecast splits the difference between these two viewpoints and arrives at an essentially deadlocked race. Here\u2019s what it looks like on the state level:\n\nAt this point in the race, our margin of error for these state forecasts is huge. There are two reasons for this: First, it is early. As pollsters are bound to remind you many times between now and November, polls are snapshots of public opinion as it stands today, not predictions of vote share in the eventual election. To the extent they are predictions at all, they predict how people would vote if an election were held today \u2014 which, of course, it will not be.\n\nIn part, this oft-repeated caveat is a convenient way for pollsters to avoid catching flak for inaccurate numbers closer to the election. But there is an important truth to it: If a voter has not yet cast their ballot, there is the possibility they may change their mind. We also don't know exactly who is going to turn out in this election yet. All this means polls earlier in the election cycle are worse at approximating the final margin.\n\nThis is where forecasting models really become useful. Above everything else, 538 makes forecasts to quantify the uncertainty inherent in the election. Our study of historical presidential election polls finds that the margin between the two candidates shifts by an average of 9 percentage points between June and November. In practical terms, that means today's polls have a true margin of error of close to 20 points. And while recent elections have not had as much volatility, we can't assume 2024 will be the same way; it's possible that this year will be closer to the historical norm.\n\nThe second major source of error is the chance that polls systematically underestimate one of the candidates, as happened in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections. We estimate that, even on Election Day, state-level polling averages of presidential general elections have an expected error of 4 points on the margin \u2014 meaning if the candidates are tied in the polling average, then on average we'd expect one to win by 4, and in rare cases they could win by 8!\n\nWhy forecast, anyway?\n\nHaving such wide margins of error is not our way of absolving ourselves of responsibility if the election result is surprising. It's our way of giving you, the reader, a more informed understanding of the range of potential election outcomes than you'd get from a single poll (or even a polling average).\n\nOver the last decade, it has become common to view election forecasting \u2014 and even polling \u2014 as purely making predictions of \"what will happen\" in the election. But we think forecasting models serve a greater journalistic purpose than a focus on prediction gives them credit for. For us here at 538, forecasting is an exercise in quantifying the reliability of various indicators of public opinion. Yes, that involves making predictions, but the real value of our work is the statistical analysis of the reliability of the numbers you are bound to see plastered all over print news media, social media and television over the next five months.\n\nWe think this is a different goal from making predictions for prediction's sake, or making a model that can \"call\" every state correctly. If you want someone to give you a prediction of who will win the election with absolute certainty, then look elsewhere. (And buyer beware.)\n\nInstead, we think we offer a unique product that can help you be smarter about the way you think about the range of outcomes for the election. As the stakes of our politics increase, a carefully calibrated sense of what could realistically happen in November \u2014 in our case, from a forecast that properly distinguishes between normal and tail risk \u2014 becomes increasingly valuable.\n\nHow to read the forecast\n\nOn that note, I'll end with a few tips on how to read our forecast responsibly:\n\nWatch the distributions. Our model simulates thousands of possible Electoral College outcomes based on the historical predictive error of the indicators we rely on. The top of our forecast page has a histogram of a random subset of these simulations, showing you which outcomes are likelier than others. We hope you get the impression that there is a wide potential range of outcomes, given all the error we're talking about.\n\nUnlikely does not mean impossible. In 2020, polls performed worse than in any election since 1980. The average state-level poll conducted in the last three weeks of that election overestimated Biden's vote margin by 4.6 points \u2014 about 1.5 times the average 3-point bias for presidential elections since 1972. In a backtest of our current model, we would have assigned about a 20 percent chance to Biden winning 306 electoral votes (the number he actually won) or fewer in 2020. We think a similar miss this year would be statistically surprising, but a possibility people should mentally prepare for.\n\nChanges in public opinion take time. We have done our best to make a model that reacts the appropriate amount to new polling data. \"Appropriate\" here means that the model will be conservative early on or when polls are bouncing generally around the same level, but also that it will be aggressive when polls appear to be moving uniformly across states \u2014 especially late in the campaign. However, as a properly Bayesian statistical model, the program that runs our forecast generates some amount of uncertainty about the parameters, resulting in unavoidable random error across our simulations. This means polling averages can change by a few decimal places day to day \u2014 and probabilities may jitter by around a point, which cascades down into uncertainty in our model. Don't sweat these small changes; instead, pay attention to bigger changes in the model over longer stretches of time.\n\nUse all the information you (reasonably) can. Polls are reasonably good predictors of election outcomes. In fact, asking people how they are going to vote is about the best single source of information you can get if your goal is to figure out how people might vote. But polls are not the only source of information available to us. 538's forecast incorporates demographics, polls and the \"fundamentals\" all the way up to Election Day; our research has found this decreases the chance for uniform bias in our forecast.\n\nOur forecast assumes normal election rules still apply. This is an important disclaimer about what our model is intended to do and what it is not. Because our model is trained on historical polling and election results, it is not intended to account for violations of normal political and election rules. We assume, for example, that if a voter legally casts a ballot, it will be counted accurately and fairly; that the electors a state elects to vote for a certain candidate in the Electoral College get to do so; that their votes are ultimately recognized by Congress; and that, as an extreme example, the election is administered on time, where officials say it will be administered and generally that people who show up to vote will be able to.\n\nThat is not to say that we dismiss the possibility of rule-breaking. From an editorial perspective, we stand ready to cover any attempts to undermine a free and fair election. But as a quantitative matter, our forecast is intended to explain variance in election outcomes based on the polls and other indicators, to serve as a supplement to polling averages and to put other political journalism in its proper context.\n\nFootnotes\n\n*Within the 95 percent confidence interval.",

        "text": "Who\u2019s in the running to be Iran\u2019s next president?\nSix candidates have been approved to run for the presidency in an election to be held on June 28.\n\nIran will be holding its presidential election on June 28 in a vote that has been brought forward from 2025 following the death of President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last month.\n\nWhile the ultimate head of the Iranian state is the unelected Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the president is the second-most powerful position.\n\nSix candidates have been approved to run for the presidency, and they are all ultimately supportive of and loyal to the supreme leader and the Iranian political system.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the candidates and what might come next in Iran.\n\nWho are the candidates running for president?\n\nThe six are:\n\nMohammad Bagher Ghalibaf \u2013 parliamentary speaker, former mayor of Tehran and former Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) air force commander\n\nSaeed Jalili \u2013 Expediency Discernment Council member, former chief nuclear negotiator\n\nAlireza Zakani \u2013 mayor of Tehran\n\nMasoud Pezeshkian \u2013 member of parliament\n\nMostafa Pourmohammadi \u2013 former interior and justice minister\n\nAmir-Hossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi \u2013 head of Iran\u2019s Foundation of Martyrs and Veterans Affairs\n\nHow are they chosen?\n\nAfter individuals submit their candidacy papers during a period set by election officials, they are all vetted by the Guardian Council, which makes the final decision on who can run.\n\nThe Guardian Council is a committee of 12 appointed members that wields considerable power in Iran.\n\nThis year, as in the previous election, the Guardian Council rejected most of the applications \u2013 the 74 rejected candidates including some famous faces.\n\nPerhaps the most well-known, particularly internationally, is former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who served between 2005 and 2013.\n\nOthers rejected include the moderate former Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani \u2013 who was considered one of the frontrunners \u2013 and former Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri.\n\nThe Guardian Council does not explain why it has rejected a candidate publicly. What is known is that its members decide on a candidacy on the basis of perceived loyalty to the government of Iran.\n\nIs there a favourite to win the election?\n\nGhalibaf and Jalili stand out as the immediate frontrunners. Both are conservatives, although Ghalibaf is seen as more relatively moderate, while Jalili is a hardliner.\n\nJalili ticks a lot of boxes when looking at a potential winner, at least when it comes to support from the establishment. He has strong ties with Khamenei and the powerful paramilitary IRGC.\n\nHe was also close to Raisi and would be the continuation candidate, having withdrawn in favour of the late president in the 2021 election.\n\nGhalibaf, on the other hand, is a technocrat, and also has close ties to the IRGC and Khamenei, but will come under attack from ultra-conservative media outlets.\n\nPezeshkian is the only candidate representing reformist Iranian politics, with other similar contenders not approved to run.\n\nHis only chance of success is if the conservative vote is split between Ghalibaf and Jalili and enough reformist Iranians vote.\n\nHowever, the reformist movement in Iran was already weak politically, with many anti-government Iranians refusing to participate in the political system so as not to legitimise it.\n\nCan any political changes be expected in Iran after the election?\n\nThe short list of approved candidates, and the political currents they largely adhere to, are signs that Iran will likely continue on its current political path following the election.\n\nThe election comes at a sensitive time for Iran, with a regional crisis as a result of Israel\u2019s war on Gaza threatening to drag Iran into direct conflict.\n\nThe country also still has a strong anti-government movement, although protests have died down after being cracked down on by the state. The protests had started in 2022 following the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman accused of not adhering to the country\u2019s dress code for women.\n\nThe movement turned off an increasing number of Iranians from the political system, which will likely further entrench the conservative wing of the country in power, at least in the short term.",

        "text": "How 538's 2024 presidential election forecast works\nFor 2024, 538 built a new presidential election forecast model from the ground up. This article explains how we did it: the ingredients that go into the forecast, how we process them and how we ultimately end up with a set of several thousand potential outcomes for the election.\n\n1. Calculate polling averages\n\nAside from two major factors (and a few minor ones), the way we calculate polling averages for our forecasting model is identical to the methodology for the presidential general election polling averages we publish on the 538 website.\n\nThe first major difference is that, when calculating averages for our forecasting model, we also apply a convention adjustment to the averages. We have found that parties tend to enjoy a reliable temporary bounce in the polls immediately following their nominating conventions in the summer. For example, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton posted her best numbers of the 2016 campaign in the two weeks after the Democratic National Convention that year \u2014 and the only time former President Donald Trump led in 538's \"polls-only\" forecast that year was just after the Republican National Convention in late July.\n\nOur convention adjustment works by subtracting a small amount from each candidate's polling average once their party's convention begins. This penalty quickly increases over the course of the convention, peaks the day after the convention concludes, and then slowly fades to zero over the next 20 days according to a geometric decay function. Unlike in past years, we do not assume conventions generate a polling bounce of a certain size. Rather, our model fits this convention adjustment for each party according to actual movement in the polling data. If no bounce is observed in the data, we won't adjust a candidate's numbers down; that would unduly punish them.\n\nThe second major difference between our published polling averages and the ones we calculate for our forecasting model is that we allow movement to be correlated between states in addition to between a state and the nation as a whole. In our published averages, if a candidate gains nationally, they gain a corresponding amount in every state \u2014 but if a candidate gains in a specific state, they don't automatically also gain in other states as well.* This is an intentional choice; our polling averages are meant to represent the state of the polls on any given day, and we want people to be able to use them to gauge the reliability of the polls in each state separately after the election is over.\n\nBut our forecast is different; its goal is a little more predictive, and our research has found that inferring across-state trends increases predictive accuracy. So our forecast both uses national polls to steer state polling averages and lets polls in one state influence the average in similar states. For instance, if President Joe Biden improves his standing in Nevada, our forecast will also expect him to be polling better in states such as Arizona and New Mexico, which have similar demographics and are part of the same political region.\n\nTo measure similarity between states, we look at three factors. The first is how similarly they have voted in presidential elections since 1948. Specifically, we look at the correlation in the two-party vote share across those 19 presidential elections. States where the Democratic or Republican vote share has tended to rise and fall in tandem \u2014 such as New York and Connecticut \u2014 receive higher similarity scores.\n\nThe second factor we take into account is demographic similarity between states. To quantify this, we use the U.S. Census Bureau's 2018-2022 American Community Survey to collect the share of each state's voting-eligible population that is Black, Hispanic, white and white without a college degree, as well as the median age of the VEP and the VEP's median income.** We also factor in the share of the state's adult population that is white and self-declared evangelical Christian from the Public Religion Research Institute's American Values Atlas, and we calculate a measure of the urban density of the state using tract-level population from the Census.\n\nFinally, we account for geographic similarity \u2014 i.e., whether two states belong to the same 538-defined political region. To define the regions, we begin by conducting fuzzy c-means clustering based on how similarly the states have voted historically. We then manually move states into new clusters when we feel we have a strong qualitative reason to do so.*** That's because geographic factors provide some residual information that electoral history does not. These residual factors could include things such as the concentration of manufacturing jobs in the Midwest, natural disasters such as Superstorm Sandy affecting the Mid-Atlantic or really anything else that would not be evident in states' political or demographic similarities.\n\nWe then fitted a regression to predict the overall correlation between each state using these three measures of between-state similarity. The resulting correlation matrix is used to project movement in the polls in one state onto similar states. It is also used in a separate regression to make sure potential polling bias is correlated across states \u2014 a process detailed in Step 3.\n\nThis approach can be thought of as predicting polling averages using regression models with various political and demographic variables. However, it is considerably more robust to overfitting than most common predictive models and means we don't put ourselves in a situation where we have to assign ad hoc weights to different model components that are inflexible when responding to new data. With this approach, the forecasting model decides how much polls in one state seem to align with polls in other states based on these three measures. If there is little match, we generate a low correlation, and vice versa if things are looking correlated.\n\nThere are a few additional minor differences between the polling averages published on our website and the ones our forecast uses. First, our forecast caps a poll's sample size at 1,500 respondents as a way to decrease the weight of surveys with huge samples, which, in our modern era of increased nonresponse and other poll biases, don't make polls that much more accurate than polls with fewer interviews. Second, the forecast uses 538's pollster ratings to scale the effective sample size of each poll \u2014 whereas the published polling averages use the ratings to weight polls directly in our regression model. These techniques generally yield the same results, but we use the sample-size-scaling approach here because the forecast model sees polls as binomial distributions of raw respondents instead of vote shares.\n\n2. Make 'fundamentals' predictions\n\nGeneral election polls are not the only information we have about what may happen in November. We also consult a set of economic and political indicators that political scientists and forecasters have collectively dubbed the \"fundamentals.\" The most familiar of these indicators is yearly real growth in the country's gross domestic product, which measures the value of all the goods and services produced in America per year. When GDP growth is strong, income usually rises and unemployment falls \u2014 and presidents tend to be reelected.\n\nHowever, we don't want to build a predictive model based on just one variable. For one thing, GDP updates too slowly for our purposes; for another, what if something happens that causes the metric to become an unreliable predictor? So instead of GDP, our forecast considers a variety of fundamental indicators, which we separate into two buckets.\n\nThe first bucket is exclusively related to economic conditions. We use 11 indicators that have historically correlated with election outcomes:\n\nOne quick comment on this mix of indicators: Usually when political scientists talk about \"fundamental\" economic indicators they are referring only to objective metrics of the economy. But recently, subjective evaluations of growth, such as the Index of Consumer Sentiment, have differed significantly from actual growth. We don't know which type will be a stronger predictor of voters' choices this year, so we are including both for a more robust prediction.\n\nWe collect data for each of these indicators as far back as they are available. (Our longest-running series is stock market data, which goes back to January 1938.) Our model transforms each of the national economic variables into a daily measure of change in the indicator over the last year, then standardizes them so all variables have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. For variables that are not available from January 1940 onward, we impute the standardized growth values on a daily basis by averaging predictions from many multivariate regression models using the values for all other indicators on that day as the predictors. We do not impute any values between the day we are running the model and the last release date for any indicator, instead carrying the last value forward to the present day. For our state-level personal income variable, we just calculate the yearly growth in state personal incomes over the prior year. (So, for 2024, we look at the change in personal income from Q4 2022 to Q4 2023.)\n\nBut this raises another question: Are the rates of change of these indicators more predictive than their actual values? If so, over what time period? Political science research suggests that voters are most reactive to recent growth, but they don't completely forget about change in the not-too-distant past, either. This is an important duality this year: America's economy has appeared to recover sharply in terms of annual growth, with inflation receding dramatically on a year-over-year basis \u2014 but this ignores how much prices rose in 2022 and 2023.\n\nWe strike a balance between short- and medium-term economic growth empirically by calculating an aggregate economic index that averages the daily annual growth rates for each of our fundamental economic indicators together over the last two years of a president's term. On any given day, the annual growth in an indicator over the previous 365 days receives two weights. The first gives a larger weight to variables that have more strongly predicted elections historically. We trim that weight so that no variable receives too little or too much weight in the overall average \u2014 the highest-weighted variables get 15 percent of the weight in the overall index; the lowest-weighted, 5 percent. The second weight is based on how far away each day is from the election according to an exponential decay function. The decay rate we selected maximizes the predictiveness of the aggregate economic index for presidential elections since 1952 \u2014 equal to giving annual growth on Election Day a weight of 100 percent and a year before Election Day a weight of 33 percent.\n\nOur aggregate economic index today measures weighted-average annual economic growth at -0.05 standard deviations above average \u2014 implying historically average (for presidential elections since 1952) economic change in the two years before the election. When the economic fundamentals have been at this level historically, the incumbent party has typically won the national popular vote by about 1 percentage point \u2014 but there has been considerable variation. In 1988, with a similar (+0.2) economic growth rating as of early June, Republican Vice President George H. W. Bush bested Democratic Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis by nearly 8 points in the national popular vote. But in 2012, with a 0.0 economic index in late May, President Barack Obama went on to win the popular vote by just 4 points.\n\nThis is where the political fundamentals come into play. Several political factors also impact the performance of presidential candidates. Incumbents, for example, have tended to enjoy a small boost when running for reelection \u2014 though that bonus has shrunk from its historical highs in the 20th century, and we don't have any cases in recent history of an incumbent president running against a former president (incumbency advantage may be smaller in that case). Additionally, voters may punish the candidate of the party controlling the White House if the president's approval rating is low, which we account for by including 538's average presidential approval rating as a fundamental. We apply a smooth rolling average to approval so that our fundamentals index does not jump around too much on a day-to-day basis; after all, it is intended to broadly represent overall conditions during the election, not provide a hyper-accurate prediction of vote choice.\n\nAt the state level,**** there are several more political factors to consider. Presidential candidates tend to perform well in their home states \u2014 as do candidates for vice president, though their home-state advantage is smaller. Last, but not least, each state tends to vote similarly for the major parties over time, varying (increasingly) little from year to year. So we include the two-party vote share in the last election as a political fundamental as well.\n\nRecently, it has also become clear that political polarization is decreasing the electorate's responsiveness to external shocks to the system. We see this in two mainstream variables. In the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment, for example, Democrats and especially Republicans have become increasingly reactive not to changes in economic conditions but to which party controls the White House. Presidential approval ratings are also now dragged down by political and ideological polarization, with a shrinking share of the opposing party that any candidate can win over. This may partially explain why presidential approval was a poor predictor of the 2022 midterm elections.*****\n\nTo account for this, we allow our model to decrease the effect of presidential approval and economic growth in more polarized elections. We consider all elections after 1996 to be \"polarized,\" based on both an increase in party polarization in U.S. House roll call votes after the 104th Congress and the decreasing shares of Americans since that time who have reported switching parties between presidential elections, according to a study of polling data from the American National Election Studies.\n\nWe include these economic and political fundamentals in a Bayesian regression to predict the two-party vote share in each state from 1952 to 2020. We use a technique called regularization to \"shrink\" the coefficients for each variable back toward zero, which helps guard against fitting the model too strongly to past data (thus making it bad at predicting the future). We also include a dummy variable for each year, accounting for any residual nationwide impacts of variables not included in our model. This is useful, as it allows us to make predictions with the appropriate amount of uncertainty on future data.\n\nThe economic and political fundamentals offer robust measures of the conditions that exert a general gravitational pull on voter behavior in presidential elections. But as a general rule, on their own, they are not super accurate at predicting outcomes, even on Election Day. To wit: We think we have developed just about the best fundamentals model a person can develop, considering all the variables one needs to account for and the acute risk of overfitting that other more conventional methods suffer from \u2014 and still, we would expect our fundamentals model to miss the vote margin in the average state by about 6.5 points. That means that a state predicted to vote for Democrats by 3 points would go to Republicans about 32 percent of the time. For reference, if the polls in a state showed Democrats up by 3 points on Election Day, you'd expect the Republicans to win only around 15-20 percent of the time.\n\n3. Combine polls and fundamentals and account for uncertainty\n\nDespite the uncertainty in our fundamentals predictions, our historical testing revealed they are still helpful in producing a reliable election forecast. This is due to several factors, one of which is that the fundamentals are still much better than nothing (in other words, a blind guess), and there are often states without much polling. Another is that, as a matter of coincidence, the bias in our fundamentals predictions has tended to counteract bias in the polls; in years like 2020 when the polls underestimated Trump, the fundamentals overestimated his support, generating a combined prediction that was closer to the actual outcome of the election than either component prediction on its own.\n\nFor this reason, our forecasting model this year will never fully phase out fundamentals-based predictions, even by Election Day. Instead, the model puts the appropriate amount of weight on each indicator depending on how much noise is in the projections.\n\nWhen we say \"the appropriate amount,\" we're referring to the weight that is derived by applying Bayes's rule to our predictions and their uncertainty. Formally, what we are doing is using our fundamentals-based prediction as an informative prior for what a polls-based model should predict the Election Day vote share to be. You can think of it sort of as stacking statistical distributions on top of each other: When we have few polls or when it's early in the campaign, our model's predictions are mostly based on the fundamentals \u2014 with their standard deviation usually around 6 points or so. But when it's Election Day in a state with a lot of polls, our uncertainty about public opinion is a lot smaller, so we will put a lot more weight on the polling data (and subsequently, our polling averages that feed into the model) when generating our final prediction.\n\nUntil now, we have mostly talked about uncertainty in the fundamentals. Let's now talk about uncertainty in the polling average, since that determines the weight the model puts on the polls.\n\nOn any given day we run the model, it considers two ways the polls could be wrong in predicting the election outcome. The first is temporal drift in public opinion. Since we're making forecasts before Election Day, there is time for people to change their minds and polls to change. So we set up the model to explore thousands of different scenarios in which the polls change by a set amount across states. That change is correlated across states as discussed in Step 1.\n\nBut we still need to know how much opinion may drift over time. We can calculate this very easily empirically. First, for all of the contests in 538's state and national presidential general election polling database (which goes back all the way to 1948, thanks to the tireless work of our research team!), we calculate retroactive state polling averages starting 300 days before each election and update them every day until Election Day. Then, we can calculate the average raw change in the polling averages from any day to November historically.\n\nWe find that the polling margin in the average state tends to move by 12 points over the entire course of the election. From 160 days out \u2014 around when we are launching this forecast \u2014 to Election Day, the expected change in margin is closer to 9 points. And by September, there is about 6 points of change left on average in the campaign. (From this, you get a good sense of how much the polls could still change here in 2024.)\n\nThe second component of polling error is industrywide polling bias, or when surveys from different pollsters miss the outcome in a similar direction. Simulating different levels of polling error lets us look into potential futures in which polls have underestimated support for each candidate by various amounts. As with the process for simulating temporal error, we need both an estimated state-by-state correlation matrix and a value determining the spread of the errors. We extract these numbers from a separate model that predicts historical misses in preelection polls.\n\nThis model tells us that the average polling miss for each party's vote share in a competitive state is a hair over 2 points, or around 3.8 points on the margin between the candidates. (Errors for one party do not trade off 100 percent with each other; some amount of error also comes from voters floating to and from the \"not sure\" and third-party options.) We draw potential polling errors for the future from a fat-tailed distribution \u2014 specifically a Student's t distribution with five degrees of freedom (a parameter that increases or decreases the likelihood of surprise \"tail\" events in our simulations). Error is also correlated across states, with the correlations fit using a similar method to the way we get correlations for the polling average and simulate temporal error. These values \u2014 expected error, the distribution's degrees of freedom and the correlations between states \u2014 come directly from the historical model we train to predict polling bias.\n\nThese three parameters \u2014 expected fundamentals uncertainty, temporal drift and polling bias \u2014 then get input into our single combined poll-averaging and forecasting model for the current election. That model uses Markov chain Monte Carlo to simulate tens of thousands of different ways the election could go, each time varying the hundreds of parameters in our model. Those parameters include major factors, like how big the incumbency bonus should be or how much a president has historically been punished for a bad approval rating, as well as seemingly tiny factors like the house effect for a pollster who does one poll in Missouri in late July.\n\nFor each of these simulations (we usually call them \"draws\" in statistics), the Markov chain also picks random values from the distributions of fundamentals, temporal drift and polling bias. There may be one simulation with an optimistic fundamentals projection for Biden, owing to the above parameter error and prediction uncertainty, that also explores a world in which he gains 5 points in the polls nationally over the next five months. Then, we might find another simulation in which polls underestimate Trump by 4-5 points on the margin \u2014 a repeat of what we saw in the 2020 election. By repeating this process tens of thousands of times, we end up with a list of many different ways the election could unfold \u2014 which is what you see in the topline chart of our interactive.\n\nConclusion\n\nThat's it for the methodology! If you see any polls that are missing or spot a methodological bug (these things do happen when we launch new models, especially with this many moving parts), hit us up with an email at polls@fivethirtyeight.com. Otherwise, I'll conclude with a brief explanation of the technical aspects of the model in more detail and an acknowledgment of past academic work on similar forecasting models.\n\nFirst, if you've read this far, then you might be interested in more details on the actual statistical model powering 538's forecast this year. It is based on my past forecasting work (you can find some of the original model code online), which created a multilevel dynamic linear model in a program for Bayesian statistical inference called Stan. This year's model adds lots of bells and whistles \u2014 such as bringing the fundamentals model directly into the forecasting model, instead of running it separately and importing predictions \u2014 and, importantly, created the ability for 538 to make predictions for major third-party candidates.\n\nI also did not work on this model alone. Holly Fuong, 538's data editor, spent hundreds of hours reviewing the model code and making valuable methodological suggestions. We also worked with a freelance statistician who helped to massively improve our model's statistical coherence and computational speed this spring. I owe another debt to the many academics who have worked on similar models previously. (This list is not exhaustive but should give you a good sense of the history of this approach.) Robert Erikson and Christopher Wlezien were the first to model support for candidates with house effects and as a smooth function of time over the campaign. Political scientist Simon Jackman later formalized a Bayesian time-series model of polls with house effects for Australian elections. Statisticians Kari Lock and Andrew Gelman employed a time-series model of polls as part of a paper forecasting election outcomes with polls and other data.\n\nMore recently, political scientist/survey statistician/pollster Drew Linzer combined aspects of these and other approaches in a Bayesian dynamic linear model of state and national polls of the 2012 general election. In 2016, Natalie Jackson at The Huffington Post also worked on a statistical forecasting model that ran on the Markov chain. And, as linked above, I worked with Gelman and statistician Merlin Heidemanns to add additional poll-level adjustments as well as other factors to model the 2020 general election in this way.\n\nFootnotes\n\n*Except insofar as a candidate's movement in a handful of states budges the national average, which then trickles down to other states.\n\n**The Hispanic percentage is exclusive; regardless of race, respondents who said they were Hispanic were excluded from all other racial groups.\n\n***We move states to and from the following groups:\n\nAlaska, Arizona, Montana and Texas start in one region. We move Alaska and Montana to the Mountain region, Arizona to the Southwest and Texas to its own region.\n\nWe collapse Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont into one region, New England.\n\nFlorida and Virginia start in the Southwest region. We move them to a new Southeast region and add Georgia and North Carolina, which both start in the South region.\n\nOklahoma starts in the Mountain region; we move it into the Texas group and take Louisiana from the South region to create one Texas mega-state we lovingly call \"Tex-ish.\"\n\nWe move Illinois from a group with the Pacific states to the Rust Belt region.\n\nIndiana starts with the Plains states. We move it to the Rust Belt.\n\nWe combine traditional Deep South and Southern border states such as Kentucky and Tennessee into a bigger South region.\n\n****Because Maine and Nebraska split their electoral votes by congressional district \u2014 awarding one electoral vote to the winner of each of their districts \u2014 we also gather all this information at the district level in these states. Our model treats districts as separate geographic units similar to states, but with larger confidence intervals.\n\n*****Additional research also suggests that voters blame the incumbent party more for a bad economy when the president is running for reelection than when the party runs a new candidate (such as when the incumbent is term-limited). We thought about accounting for that, too, but we think adding too many variables to the model would get us firmly into overfitting territory, so we didn't end up doing so.",

        "text": "ABC News Announcement: All-New Forecasting Model for the 2024 Presidential Election.\nABC News announced that its renowned data journalism organization, 538, launched its all-new forecasting model for the 2024 presidential election. The model will constantly update with newly approved polls as they publish updates based on key indicators, including the polls' historical accuracy and methodological transparency. The tool will examine how reliable polling and other data are at predicting election outcomes from today through election day 2024.\n\nSEE WHO IS FAVORED TO WIN THE 2024 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION\n\nThe model is available on ABCNews.com/538, along with a detailed methodology explaining how the model was built from the ground up. Widget integrations will be available on the website's home page in the coming weeks.\n\n\"The forecast formalizes our theories of voter behavior, uncertainty in the polls, and other factors,\" said G. Elliott Morris, editorial director of data analytics for ABC News. \"It asks how likely either candidate is to win the election, given their position in the polls, the time remaining until election day, and how accurate the polls have been in the past. It's a unique new way of using various data to answer the question: How much should I trust these polls?\"\n\nThe initial forecast reflects a very close race between incumbent President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump. The race remains especially close in key swing states, with Trump leading current polls in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona, Nevada and Georgia.\n\nThe model also makes forecasts for major third-party candidates, including Robert F Kennedy Jr., who currently has a significant chance of affecting the election outcome. However, there is still a lot of uncertainty in the forecast at this stage of the campaign.\n\nForthcoming 538 articles based on the model will spotlight regular election updates on where the race stands, the fundamental indicators of the race, and how reliable the polls are at forecasting outcomes over time. 538 will also report on how the model estimates polls change from now to the conventions and election day, as well as polling bias and how the model processes it, and a comparison of what the model says today versus what it determined at this point in previous presidential elections years, including 2020, 2016, 2012 and more.\n\nAbout 538: ABC News' 538 is a trusted data journalism source for poll aggregation and election-forecasting models for U.S. elections, political reporting and more. 538's models and polling data are used across ABC News' broadcast, streaming and digital channels.",

        "text": "Millions of Americans Don\u2019t Have Documents Proving Their Citizenship Readily Available\nLast year, the Brennan Center partnered with VoteRiders, the Center for Civic Democracy and Engagement (CDCE) at the University of Maryland, and Public Wise to survey Americans about what identification they possess and what they know about voter ID laws in their state. We also asked respondents whether they had documents that prove their citizenship \u2014 a passport, birth certificate, or naturalization papers \u2014 readily available. Our research indicates that more than 9 percent of American citizens of voting age, or 21.3 million people, don\u2019t have proof of citizenship readily available. There are myriad reasons for this \u2014 the documents might be in the home of another family member or in a safety deposit box. And at least 3.8 million don\u2019t have these documents at all, often because they were lost, destroyed, or stolen.\n\nWe also uncovered evidence of racial disparities in these numbers: while just over 8 percent of self-identified white American citizens don\u2019t have citizenship documents readily available, that number is nearly 11 percent among Americans of color.\n\nConvenience matters when it comes to consistent participation in American elections. Even if a citizen is certain that a passport or birth certificate is in a safety deposit box at the bank, voters are busy; an additional trip to the bank would surely prevent some voters from registering to vote if such documents were required. (We consider a document to be readily available if respondents \u201ccould quickly find it if [they] had to show it tomorrow.\u201d)\n\nWhat\u2019s more, our estimates are probably conservative measures of impact. While it\u2019s true that most Americans can access these documents, most of us don\u2019t walk around town carrying our passport or birth certificate. If those documents were required for voter registration, most would not have them readily available to take advantage of opportunities they encounter at schools, churches, or other community spaces where registration drives register many Americans to vote.\n\nWe have known for nearly two decades that many Americans do not have readily available documentary proof of citizenship. In 2006, the Brennan Center published research indicating that 7 percent of Americans didn\u2019t have citizenship documents readily available. In this updated research, we incorporated best practices on surveying hard-to-reach populations. Our updated results are remarkably consistent with those from 2006: like then, millions of Americans would be prevented from registering to vote if they were required to prove their citizenship. More troubling still is our finding that these requirements would fall disproportionately on Americans of color.\n\nThe current protections against noncitizen voting are effective: ballots cast by noncitizens are vanishingly rare. Requiring proof of citizenship would solve nothing, but it would create major barriers to registration for eligible voters, especially those who already face disproportionate barriers to participation in our democracy. We should be making it easier, not harder, for these citizens to participate.",

        "text": "Read the exclusive USA TODAY interview of independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.\nIndependent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. appears to be pulling voters from major party candidates President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nKennedy, 70, a longtime environmental lawyer, sat down on June 4 with USA TODAY Senior National Political Correspondent Sarah D. Wire and New Hampshire election reporting fellow Margie Cullen to discuss his ambitions for the race, whether he'll make it on every state ballot and what his father would think of his campaign.\n\nMore:Robert F. Kennedy Jr. doesn't see himself as a spoiler for Democrats or GOP\n\nBelow is a transcript of that conversation that has been lightly edited for clarity. Context has been added to some claims.\n\nWire: I'm going to start with probably the question you've gotten the most from people: an independent candidate has never won. What makes you think you're different and not just a spoiler candidate as some people have said?\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nKennedy: I think that we're in a different time in history than we've ever been before. I'm running against the two least popular candidates who have ever run for president. I'm running at a time when between 70% and 80% of Americans, depending on what poll that you follow, doesn't want a contest between President Trump and President Biden. In polls that pit me against either candidate, I beat them both. There's three polls that have done this. The biggest poll is the Zogby poll, which is the biggest poll done during this election, it's 10 times the size of almost any other poll. 26,000 respondents were surveyed, and I beat Biden in a head to head race 39 states to 11. So in a landslide. I beat President Trump, but [by] a much, much narrower margin. In both cases, President Biden, whether I'm in the race or out, cannot beat President Trump. I, I stay in the race, President Biden loses. If I get out of the race, he loses even worse, he loses two more states, Maine and Virginia. So what I've said to President Biden is that I will do a spoiler agreement with you. And let's co-fund a national poll in October. And whichever one of us does worse against President Trump, that one will drop out, and I'm happy to abide by that poll.\n\nAccording to pollsters, the Zogby poll, commissioned by the Kennedy campaign, has flaws in the sampling and premise that make it unreliable.\n\nWire: But this is not going to be a two man race, you pointed to polls that pit you against two of them-\n\nKennedy: What I would say is there's never been an independent candidate that we know of, that's run before, that's been able, that in head-to-head races, would be beat both other candidates. My challenge over the next five months, is to persuade Americans to vote out of hope, out of inspiration, rather than out of fear. In every poll, I beat President Trump and President Biden in terms of favorability.\n\nOh, there is a big, big majority of Americans who would want to vote for me, but the reason they're voting for President Trump or President Biden in the current polls is because they're so terrified of the other candidate: that if Biden gets elected, it will be the end of the Republic, if Trump gets elected, it will be the end of the Republic. And so they're voting out of fear. And my job is, my challenge is, to persuade Americans to vote out of hope rather than out of fear.\n\nCullen: Along with that, you're on less than a dozen state ballots right now. So is there a path to the presidency if you don't get on the ballot in every state, or on the ballot in enough states to have a chance of reaching that 270 Electoral College votes?\n\nKennedy: We will be on the ballot in every state by mid-July. We're on the ballot in seven states now. And in another 10 states we have enough signatures to get on the ballot, but we're withholding them for strategic reasons that are obvious. And we will, but we've got the four hardest states already. Those are states that everybody said we could not get, which is Texas, California, Florida and New York. The other ones are pretty simple. And the rate that we're getting on, that we get signatures, the return on effort, all the people who are professionals in this area say they've never had an easier task of getting signatures.\n\nFor example in New Hampshire, we got 5,000 signatures in a single day. 3,000 are required. We have not filed in New Hampshire, again, for strategic reasons. We're going to file at the last minute because the DNC is going to try to eliminate our signatures and challenge them and we want to give them less time to do that. But Maine, we have until August to get 4,000 signatures. I think we're more than halfway there. And that's an easy task for us. In New York, we were required 45,000 signatures, we got 137,000. And we threw out 37,000. So we really got over [170,000]. And in Texas, we were required to get about 113,000, we got quarter million. So we're beating out all the metrics, and we're doing things that the DNC and the RNC designed these rules to make sure nobody could do, but we're doing it anyway. And we're doing something that all the pundits, almost all of them said we wouldn't be able to do.\n\nCullen: In New Hampshire, just to follow up quickly since I'm from the New Hampshire paper, when did you get those signatures in one day? And also I know the filing period \u2013 it only starts today and ends next Friday. So will you file next week?\n\nKennedy: In New Hampshire? Yeah, we'll file next week. We got them all on a single day on primary day. Oh, and you know, it was snowing that day, if you recall. So it makes it more difficult because you have to ask people to take their gloves off and to stop in the middle of the sidewalk when the snow is coming down on them. And you have to make sure that their hands aren't cold so that they sign their signature legibly. And so under those very difficult circumstances, we were still able to get the signatures in a single day, all of them \u2013 double what we needed practically.\n\nWire: What are the big differences between you and Biden and you and Trump? What makes you appealing to folks?\n\nKennedy: I think a number of things, but if you look at President Biden and President Trump, everybody would remark that they're very different candidates, and that their dispositions are different, their personalities, the way they interact with the world. Ideologically, they're very, very different, their rhetoric, their style. But if you look at actually the issues that they're arguing over is a very, very narrow Overton window. And it's mainly culture war issues, its guns, its abortion, its trans rights, it's border security, and are all important issues. But they're not the really existential issues that most Americans are really deeply concerned with right now, the fact that we have these historical inflation rates, young Americans can't get into a home and neither of these candidates have a plan for getting them into a home.\n\nThey presided over this situation that we're in right now where they can't afford a home. Neither candidate can talk about the debt, which is one of the biggest issues, it's $34 trillion. And we're now paying more or are servicing that debt than for our military budget. Within five years, 50 cents out of every dollar that we collect in taxes will go to servicing the debt. Within 10 years, 100%. So it's existential. And President Trump can't talk about it because he ran up the bulk of it. He ran up $8 trillion of debt during his four years in office. After promising he was going to balance the budget. And that's more money spent than every president combined from George Washington to George W. Bush, 283 years of American history. President Biden is racing to catch up with him in his four years, he's now adding every 90 days a trillion dollars to the debt, and it's utterly unsustainable and, I'm the only one with a plan for fixing it.\n\nThe two of them presided over the chronic disease epidemic, which was the greatest expense. It\u2019s now $4.3 trillion. It's five times the military budget. And neither of them has ever spoken of it, neither of them has a plan for dealing with it. I have a plan for ending it overnight. They need everyone talking about the forever wars, because both of them have been supporting and feeding the forever wars. I have a plan for winding down the forever wars. Neither of them have a plan for ending the toxic division in our country, which is more poisonous and more dangerous than any time since the American Civil War.\n\nWire: Can I talk to you about that division for just a moment. You mentioned that you appeal to voters on both sides. But what do you think it is that makes you appealing when your policy stances don't really fit in either party's normal platform? So what is it about you that you think people find the most appealing?\n\nKennedy: What I said when I announced a year ago is that I was going to avoid the little culture wars issues that keep us all at each other's throats. And instead, I was going to focus on the values and the issues that keep us all together. And over the past year, I think I've kept that promise. And I've identified all of these issues that Americans are deeply concerned about. But the Republicans, Democrats don't talk about that. They're not part of the debate. And those issues, again, there's the chronic disease epidemic, there's the fact that kids can't get into houses, there's the national deficit, there\u2019s the polarization, there\u2019s the issue of AI and blockchain, which are again, these are the industries that can pull us out of this, of this debt crisis.\n\nBut, and President Trump and President Biden have them driven out of the country. It's very important to have them here, but it's also important to regulate them so they don't become tools for government or corporate suppression of Americans, but they're instead tools that give us power over our government. On issues like the environment they both, President Trump and President Biden, are focused on one aspect of the environmental issue that is the most divisive, which is climate change.\n\nWire: I hear what you're saying. But you're focusing a lot on the other candidates, and I would love to hear why you think you're the right person.\n\nKennedy: If you ask Americans, what they really care about \u2212 those are the issues, the little issues that President Biden and President Trump are using the culture war issues or issues that Americans can get excited and inflamed and they activate the base. Most Americans are more deeply concerned with whether their kids are going to get into a house, they're concerned with the cost of $4 eggs, $4 milk, $6 gasoline. And President Trump and President Biden do not have an answer for that. It's the issues at the core of people's concerns about what's happening to America today, winding down the military, ending inflation, ending this chronic disease that is now debilitating 60% of our kids, almost everybody in our country knows kids who are affected. They're not even talking about them. No solutions, it\u2019s not even on their debating screen. And yet, when I talk to Americans, it's their principal concerns. I think President Trump, President Biden are missing that because they need to inflame their base. They need to get people frightened. They need to keep people angry. And I'm trying to do the opposite. I'm trying to bring people together and get them to look calmly at how do we rebuild America?\n\nAccording to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 40% of school-aged children and adolescents have at least one chronic condition. While estimates vary, there is no evidence that the majority of children in America have a chronic illness. According to a study by the National Library of Medicine, an increase in ADHD diagnoses could represent an increase in recognition.\n\nCullen: Changing topics a bit: What do you think of Trump's conviction, should he drop out? Should he exit the race?\n\nKennedy: You know, what I've said from the beginning is I think that conviction is going to backfire on the Democratic Party. I think it's a bad strategy for the DNC. I think the DNC feels like it doesn't have a candidate who can win in a fair election. So their strategy is to try to get rid of their opponents using the courts, including me. They're trying to get rid of me by challenging my ballot access, which is not very democratic. And I think the strategy of using Democratic prosecutors to discredit or to convict Donald Trump is going to backfire. I've said that from the beginning, and I think the events have validated that. President Trump, I think within 24 hours, they may have gotten $200 million in small donations. I think that both candidates, incidentally, are doing that. They're weaponizing the court system for political purposes.\n\nMy father, his first week in office at the Justice Department he called all the division heads, he called all the bureau chiefs and he said, there\u2019s one rule here, we never politicize this department. Americans need to have faith that their judicial system and their regulatory and enforcement agencies are, are colorblind when it comes to partisanship. And President Trump laid the precedent by promising to lock up Hillary Clinton to appoint a special prosecutor to put her in jail. This is the kind of thing that happens in third-world countries and banana republics. That happens in tyrannical countries. It happened in Britain prior to the revolution when the king would put his political opponents in Parliament in jail in order to stop them from coming to Parliament. And the framers were very conscious of that. And I'm also conscious that we want a country where people believe that the rule of law applies to everybody. But there's a delicate balance. I was a prosecutor, I was a prosecutor in New York, and there's a delicate balance. And these kinds of cases where you need to be conscious of the optics, about whether that case is going to be perceived by a large block of the American public as politically motivated. And I think in this particular case, which was, there was a lot of indicia that suggested that is what happened. There was the prosecutors had originally rejected the case, it was rejected by federal prosecutors, in 2016, and the current district attorney who brought the case ran on a platform that he was going to prosecute President Trump. So it was politicized from the beginning. And I think it's not only undemocratic, but it also is just going to backfire on the DNC. And I think it's going to make our country more polarized. Even if the DNC succeeded in doing this, what do they get in the long run? They get a result where half of the country is so angry that they're going to be ungovernable. And is that something we really want? Or shouldn't we be concerned about America and not just winning a political contest? Shouldn\u2019t we be concerned about trying to bridge the gap between Americans rather than further inflame it? And I'm no fan of Donald Trump\u2019s by the way, that's why I'm running against him.\n\nWire: You mentioned your father, which kind of segues into, obviously, we saw 15 prominent members of your family endorse Biden. But I'm wondering, what do you think your father would think about you running for president?\n\nKennedy: Well, obviously, I think my father would strongly support me. I can't think of a single issue that my dad felt strongly about that I wouldn't check the same box. I think all the issues that I'm running on are issues that he felt deeply about, about ending war, the addiction to war, about standing up for the First Amendment, the environment, about ending this corrupt merger of state and corporate power that has transformed our agencies into sock puppets for the industries they are supposed to regulate.\n\nPeople have different opinions, and they're entitled to those. When Lincoln died, Seward, who was Secretary of Defense, was in the room when he died said he belongs to the ages. I think the same is true of my father and my uncle, they belong to all Americans and Americans are entitled to have their own version of who my father and my uncle [were], of what they would do on certain issues. And I enjoy hearing those debates all the time. I differ with a lot of people but I spent a life trying to understand my father, reading all the books about my dad, talking to people since I was very, very young and I think I have a really clear understanding of where he came down on issues and I'm very grateful that I share his beliefs and I share his values. And I've tried to live my life with the same kind of commitment to the same values.\n\nCullen: Could you clarify your position on abortion for us? I know it's a hot button issue. And in the past, you kind of walked back on a national abortion ban. So just wanted to clarify.\n\nKennedy: I've been arguably the leading advocate in this country, for bodily autonomy, for medical freedom, for keeping government out of medical decisions of individual Americans. And so my position has been until recently that abortion should be the woman's choice up till right until the ninth, the end of the ninth month. Incidentally, I took that position believing after a lot of discussion that there is no woman who would want to get pregnant, and then carry a baby nine months and get that baby aborted in the last, week of pregnancy. Why would that ever happen, and my understanding was the only reason that would happen was because there was some kind of medical necessity, either the baby was going to live a short and agonizing life and then die because of a disease, a genetic disease, or because the mother's life was at risk.\n\nAnd in those cases, I think is more important than ever to keep government out of the decision. That was the position that some of the advocacy groups took, that there were basically no elective abortions in the ninth month. I was shown a lot of data that showed that actually there are a fair number of elective abortions in the last month.\n\nAnd so I am, in reaction to seeing those data, I changed my position, because I think when it comes to elective abortions, once the baby reaches viability, that the state does have an increasing interest in protecting that life. And I went back to the Roe v. Wade position, which is that in the last trimester, after viability in other words, that the states do have a right to protect the child. And my position has been to try to reduce the number of abortions. My policy is called \"More Choices, More Life.\" We found that 52% of abortions are linked to women who do not feel that they can afford the child, they're the product of affordability decisions.\n\nAnd we have a program to try to make sure that a pregnancy has never terminated because of concerns about affordability of that child and part of that is to use some of the money from winding down the Ukraine war and the military commitments abroad to make sure that we have childcare for every child in this country and that's important for our economy too in rebuilding our economy. Childcare investments create 18 jobs for a million dollars spent. Investments on military create two. All of my investments, my government programs are going to be about enlarging our economy, creating more jobs in order to get ourselves out of the debt crisis.\n\nAccording to a 2023 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that analyzed abortion data in the US in 2021, 0.9% of abortions are performed at over 21 weeks. 93.5% of abortions are performed at 13 weeks or less.\n\nWire: You talked about going back to the Roe v. Wade standard, there are some in Congress who would like to go to either a nationwide standard or to let states do anything they want past a certain number of weeks. Do you lean one way or the other? Do you think that we need a national standard so people can have the same access to health care in one state as they do in another?\n\nKennedy: My position is the same as Roe v. Wade, that I would give national protection to make sure that it's a woman's choice, always a mother's choice up until viability and then at viability recognize that the states have increasing interest in protecting the life of the child.\n\nWire: You said earlier this year that the Trump team had asked you about being their vice president, they've pushed back on that. I was hoping you can maybe help give some clarity to that. Did that conversation occur? And who did you talk with in the Trump world?\n\nKennedy: We were approached multiple times by multiple people. But it's not an argument I care to win. It's just a fact. And in fact, The New York Times has also talked to some of those people. I don't know if they talked to the same people we did, but they have confirmed that that happened. I don't care whether people believe it or not. I didn't say it to make a point. I was just telling something that was true. I have no interest in defending that. It just happens to be true. President Trump knows it. I know it. And that's, you know, we may have to leave it like that.\n\nWire: It's interesting, you talked about polling with in terms of Biden, because it seems at least from social media postings and press conferences that former President Trump is a lot more worried about you. Why do you think that might be?\n\nKennedy: I take more votes away from President Trump than from President Biden. In our own polls, about 57% of my voters, if I leave the race will vote for President Trump. And in the big national poll that Zogby did it confirmed that that President Trump actually if I drop out, he wins two extra states, he wins Maine and Virginia. I think initially that he was much more welcoming to me, but I think he's looking at the same numbers as we are. In terms of the Democrats. I think they're mounting a much more aggressive campaign to keep me off the ballot than the RNC is and it's been publicized that they have a hit squad of people that's run by Mary Beth Cahill [who] used to be my uncle Teddy's Chief of Staff and by Lis Smith and a number of other I would say veteran political, I don't know why you'd call them but people who are experts in negative research and in making sure that opponents are discredited or gotten off the ballot and they're putting a lot more money.\n\nWe see them in court a lot more than we see the Republicans. President Trump has been much more vocal and a lot of his allies in the press are now coming after me. But I don't think the RNC has mounted the kind of campaign that the DNC has actually to try and make it so I can't run it all. And President Trump to his credit has said, although in private discussions his representatives told CNN to keep me off the debating stage, in public announcements from President Trump himself and from his team, they say that they'd welcome me on the debating stage, whereas President Biden has been, has uniformly said he won\u2019t debate if they let me onto the stage.\n\nWire: I would love to ask you one more question before we let you go. I'm wondering if there are any hard feelings from your attempt to run as part of the Democratic Party. Has that changed your opinion of the party?\n\nKennedy: Hard feelings? It's not what happened to me that's changed my impression of the party, I think what everybody sees is that it's become the party of war, it's become the party of censorship. It's kind of abandoned the middle class, it's become the party of this new oligarchy of tech billionaires and I think this happened across the board with both political parties, since the Citizens United case, which was in 2008, when this tsunami of corporate money started pouring into the process. This election is going to cost them $10 billion. Well, you're not going to raise $10 billion from the little people and so the little guy in this country is now, I don't think, even a participant on any level in the political process. It's all about money now.\n\nAnd it's not just the Republicans, which is kind of where the division used to be. Now you look at who the Democratic Party donors are, it's BlackRock, State Street, Vanguard, it's the defense companies, it's the pharmaceutical companies. And that's who runs the DNC. So I don't by the way, I don't walk around embittered about stuff, I don't cart resentments around, I think that those are corrosive. And that's like swallowing poison and hoping someone else will die. Resentments tend to hurt the people who are caring them. So I just take life as it comes.\n\nBut I can see that the party has changed very much from the party that I grew up with. And I think that the major driving force in that is this Citizens United case, which is very, very difficult for us to get away from. Ultimately, we're going to need a constitutional amendment, because I don't think it's compatible with democracy. I think we're headed towards kind of an oligarchy, a feudal model in our country, and a corporate Kleptocracy, I would say, or plutocracy, which is kind of the war, a permanent war party, run by billionaires, and I don't think that's compatible with America's role as the exemplary democracy around the world.\n\nWhile corporations can donate to Democratic groups and candidates, the Democratic National Committee and other organizations are not bound by that funding.\n\nWire: Well, Margaret, do you have any other questions?\n\nCullen: Just one last quick one. If you find yourself behind the polls, would you drop out? Are you trying to make third party candidates more viable?\n\nKennedy: I mean, I'm trying to win the election. I think what's interesting about my polling that everybody has picked up on, all the people who have looked and looked at cross sabs is that the people who are voting for me, the extent they are Democrats and Republicans is pretty even. I may have a slight edge of the Republicans over Democrats right now. That may change who knows. But the big bulk of my supporters are people who had withdrawn from the political process. And it's a large group of people. And we see that every day at my rallies.\n\nI hear it when I walk through an airport, when I walk down the street, people saying I've given up on politics until you came along. And, our donor base, our people we're able to look at this and see most of them have never given to a political campaign before. I think my presence in the race is important. I think we can win the race. And I think it's important that Americans feel that its potential for democracy to work for them, and they don't have to vote for the lesser of two evils. They don't have to hold their nose and vote for a candidate they don't like because they hate the other guy worse. I think it's important to give them an alternative where they can continue to have hope for our democracy, and vote out of inspiration rather than fear.\n\nWire: All right, well, thank you so much for your time. We really do appreciate the chance to sit down with you is there anything else you think we should know we didn't ask about?\n\nKennedy: That's up to you. There's a lot I think you should know but maybe another time.",

        "text": "Why oil companies are raking in record profits under Joe Biden\nCNN \u2014\n\nNearly four years ago, while campaigning in the runup to the last presidential election, Donald Trump warned that President Joe Biden would \u201cdestroy\u201d the oil industry.\n\nAs Trump and Biden are set once again to face off in a presidential election, Trump has renewed claims that Biden\u2019s agenda has hurt energy producers, promising to hit rewind on Biden\u2019s environmental policies.\n\nBut the oil and gas industry in the United States has thrived under the current president, even as the Biden administration has touted its efforts to transition away from fossil fuels and towards green energy sources.\n\nIn the last three and a half years, US oil production \u2014 and oil and gas company profits \u2014 have broken records.\n\nThe top five US-based oil and gas companies by market cap, according to S&P Global \u2014 ExxonMobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), ConocoPhillips (CPP), EOG Resources (EOG) and Schlumberger (SLB) \u2014 have raked in more than $250 billion in profits between 2021 and 2023. That\u2019s a 160% jump compared to the first three years of the pro-big-oil Trump administration, according to calculations by CNN.\n\nThe energy industry\u2019s recent profit windfall underscores the limited influence of any US president \u2014 whether in favor of fossil fuel or not \u2014 in the global oil and gas market.\n\nIn Biden\u2019s case, many of the dynamics that supercharged oil and gas industry profits during his presidency were not directly related to his administration\u2019s policies: Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, a post-pandemic surge in travel demand and the proliferation of new technology that helped the US significantly increase its production of oil and natural gas all played a role, said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service.\n\n\u201cOn balance, I think it\u2019s been a really, really good atmosphere for most [oil] companies,\u201d said Kloza.\n\nBoon for oil executives and shareholders\n\nAccording to the US Energy Information Administration, the US produced more crude oil than ever in 2023, beating the previous record set in 2019 \u2014 and Investors have been richly rewarded. The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE), which tracks the performance of the largest oil and gas companies, is up more than 100% since Biden\u2019s inauguration.\n\nThe cash-rich industry has not shied away from dealmaking. Last month, oil giant ConocoPhillips said it would acquire rival Marathon Oil in a deal valued at $22.5 billion. That acquisition comes on the heels of ExxonMobil\u2019s $60 billion purchase of Pioneer Natural Resources and Hess shareholders\u2019 approval of a $53 billion sale to Chevron.\n\nOver the last several years, big oil companies have used profits to purchase their own stock on the open market, lifting share prices. Notably, Chevron announced plans for a $75 billion buyback last year and Exxon said it would ramp up its annual pace of share repurchases to $20 billion per year.\n\nChevron\u2019s major buyback package drew reproach from the Biden administration.\n\n\u201cFor a company that claimed not too long ago that it was \u2018working hard\u2019 to increase oil production, handing out $75 billion to executives and wealthy shareholders sure is an odd way to show it,\u201d said White House spokesperson Abdullah Hasan last year.\n\nShareholders were also paid in the form of dividends. In 2023, ExxonMobil was the third-largest dividend payer in the S&P 500, behind only Microsoft and Apple, according to ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods.\n\nMany oil CEOs have also grown their own fortunes during the Biden administration. Chevron CEO Mike Wirth saw his compensation grow 17%, from $22.6 million in 2021 to $26.5 million in 2023. Exxon CEO Woods\u2019 compensation rose an eye-popping 56% in that span, from $23.6 million in 2021 to $36.9 million in 2023.\n\nClean energy push \u2014 and pull\n\nIn his first term, Trump overturned more than 100 environmental rules and actions put in place by the Obama administration.\n\nIn April, Trump allegedly promised oil industry executives that he would reverse some of Biden\u2019s climate policies in exchange for a $1 billion contribution to this reelection campaign, according to an exclusive report from The Washington Post.\n\nWhile climate advocates say Biden\u2019s record regarding the climate crisis and clean energy is mixed, Biden delivered on the largest climate investment in US history\u2014by far the biggest legislative win for the environmental movement since the Clean Air Act.\n\nOn his first day in the White House, Biden revoked a permit that his predecessor, Trump, had granted to the controversial Keystone XL pipeline and placed a temporary moratorium on oil and gas leasing in the Arctic.\n\n\u201cThe era of supporting fossil fuels, even as a temporary bridge to a clean future, is over,\u201d Bob McNally, president of consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group told CNN at the time.\n\nAdditionally, the Biden administration has taken steps to try to nudge the auto industry away from using gas-powered cars, like rolling out new tailpipe emissions standards and revamping electric vehicle tax credits.\n\nEarlier this year, Biden announced a temporary pause on approving several pending liquefied natural gas export projects, saying \u201cThis pause on new LNG approvals sees the climate crisis for what it is: the existential threat of our time.\u201d\n\nThe energy industry has taken note. This year, members of the oil and gas industry have largely donated to Republican candidates and conservative groups, according to Open Secrets.\n\nHowever, in March, the Biden administration approved ConocoPhillips\u2019 massive Willow oil drilling project on Alaska\u2019s North Slope, which holds around 600 million barrels of oil, angering climate advocates.\n\nDespite his mixed record with oil and gas companies, though, Biden has presided over a historic run for the industry, Kloza said.\n\n\u201cThe oil industry in general, and this is true from the wellhead to the refinery to the gas pumps, is much, much more prosperous in the last 10 years than it was in any 10-year period prior,\u201d Kloza said. \u201cIt\u2019s just been a renaissance.\u201d",

        "text": "General Election 2024: the Sikh vote\nBy Hardeep Singh\n\nReligion Counts, the recent research by the think tank Theos analysing voting intentions by religious affiliation between 2014 and 2023, shows the Anglican vote has consistently been leaning to the right, Catholics tend to be floating voters and Muslims broadly support Labour, although the data doesn\u2019t factor in trends since 7 October and the Israel Gaza war.\n\nThere is no suggestion that any one faith group is a single monolith in its worldview or politics, and there exists a diversity of opinion and political persuasion among people of all faiths and none. You are as likely to find an Anglican Conservative, as you are a Sikh, Hindu, or Buddhist. However, the launch of the campaign group The Muslim Vote which suggests it can mobilise four million of the faithful and is largely based on pro-Palestine politics has piqued curiosity as to whether other faith groups have a similar coalition of organisations working to galvanise community votes for the election on 4 July.\n\nThere is a dearth of data available for smaller faith groups such as Sikhs, so the question then arises: does the Sikh vote exist?\n\nHistorical context, voting intentions and Sikhs in politics\n\nThe British Sikh Report (2023) asked respondents what their voting intentions would be if there were an election now. The survey results indicated that 43 per cent would vote Labour, 20 per cent Conservative and 4 per cent each for the Liberal Democrats and the Greens.\n\nThe results came as little surprise, and broadly indicate the historic leaning towards Labour among a significant section of the British Sikh community, and British Indians more broadly.\n\nPart of this can be traced back to the legacy of left-leaning organisations, such as the Indian Workers\u2019 Association (IWA), a former president of which, Piara Singh Khabra, became the Labour party MP for Southall Ealing between 1992 and 2007, the first British Sikh to become an MP. Another factor is the passing of legislation such as the Race Relations Act in 1968.\n\nWhile new immigrants from the Indian subcontinent in the 1950s and 1960s would have been more inclined to support Labour, the story is different when it comes to the Conservatives. In April 1968, Enoch Powell, then the Conservative MP for Wolverhampton South West, delivered his infamous Rivers of Blood speech. This coincided with a time when Sikh bus drivers were fighting for the right to wear turbans at work. Powell had been critical of the Sikh campaign in his constituency. In 1962, the Conservative government passed the Commonwealth Immigrants Act which restricted immigration to those with work permits. Historically, therefore, the Conservatives were not a party that Sikhs and other immigrants would have naturally gravitated towards.\n\nAttitudes have shifted with successive Conservative parties over recent decades. Paul Uppal, who is of Sikh heritage, served as the Conservative MP for Powell\u2019s former constituency between 2010 and 2015.\n\nThe economic success of British Indians through professions or business more broadly is also in part responsible for a shift in political leaning towards Conservatism. Data from the 2021 Census, for example, shows a higher rate of home ownership among people who identified as Sikh (77.7 per cent) when compared with the rest of the population in England and Wales at 62.7 per cent.\n\nA 2021 survey by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, indicated support for Labour had eroded among British Indians, particularly Hindus and Christians.\n\nSikh MPs and candidates in the general election\n\nLabour\u2019s Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi is the prospective parliamentary candidate (PPC) for Slough in Berkshire. He made history in 2017 as the first turbaned Sikh to enter the Commons. Preet Kaur Gill, the Labour PPC for Birmingham Edgbaston, also made history in 2017 \u2014 as the first female Sikh to be elected to parliament.\n\nBoth Slough and Birmingham Edgbaston have been highlighted by the The Muslim Vote as constituencies with more than 10 per cent Muslim voters and where independent pro-Palestine candidates are standing.\n\nTanmanjeet Dhesi has been criticised for abstaining in the parliamentary vote on a ceasefire in the Israel-Gaza war. In this election, he faces opposition from an independent candidate, Azhar Chohan, a human rights lawyer and former Labour party case worker, who told the Slough Observer that the town\u2019s diverse communities \u201cfeel a lack of genuine representation from the major parties on critical issues affecting them\u201d.\n\nA social media post by The Muslim Vote encouraged Muslims to vote for Mr Chohan, and Mr Dhesi responded on social media, criticising efforts to split the vote on religious lines. Writing on Twitter/X he said: \u201cSome [are] trying to toxify the town and divide our diverse community by importing toxic politics of persuading people to vote based on religion or biradari [brotherhood] \u2014 asking one faith to \u2018vote in a block\u2019. This election is about our economy and public services. #MoreInCommon than what divides us.\u201d\n\nLabour has an unprecedented number of Sikh and Sikh heritage candidates standing for a parliamentary seat, a total of 16, which includes sitting MPs. They include Gurinder Singh Josan, PPC for Smethwick, west of Birmingham; Neena Gill, a former Member of the European Parliament who is PPC for Bromsgrove, Worcestershire; and Kirith Entwistle, PPC for Bolton North East.\n\nThe Conservatives have three candidates of Sikh heritage, including Satbir Gill for the Scottish Conservatives; and Ashvir Sangha, a former President of the Oxford Union, who is the PPC for Birmingham Edgbaston.\n\nThe Lib Dems say they have two candidates \u201cwho have chosen to mark their heritage as Sikh\u201d.\n\nThe smaller parties such as Reform, and George Galloway\u2019s Workers Party of Great Britain, also have Sikh heritage candidates. Former England cricketer Monty Panesar abandoned his plans to stand for the Workers Party last month after one week. He had intended to contest Southall Ealing in west London. Darshan Singh Azad is standing for the Workers Party of Great Britain in Ealing Southall.\n\nKey issues for Sikh voters\n\nMany Sikh voters would have similar issues of concerns to the rest of the electorate: the economy, healthcare, crime, education, housing and asylum and immigration.\n\nSikh organisations have been pushing the government for parity in public policy when it comes to faith groups in areas such as hate crime. They say the government\u2019s four-year crime strategy, Action Against Hate, has failed to acknowledge the backlash to Islamism suffered by Sikhs and Hindus. Of \u201cIslamophobic hate crime\u201d recorded by the Metropolitan Police in 2015, 28 per cent of the victims of were non-Muslims, including Sikhs, Hindus, Christians and people of no recorded faith.\n\nThere are Sikh-specific issues, one of which is the marking of the 40th anniversary of Operation Blue Star, the Indian Army\u2019s attack on the Sri Harmandir Sahib, the Golden Temple, in Amritsar, in search of Sikh \u201cmilitants\u201d. The number killed is disputed but some reports indicate thousands died, including many innocent pilgrims.\n\nFour months later, in October 1984, the Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi \u2014 who had ordered Operation Bluer Star \u2014 was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards. Government-orchestrated pogroms followed in Delhi and throughout India.\n\nIn 2014, through an inadvertent release of top-secret documents from the UK National Archives in Kew, it was revealed that Britain had dispatched a special forces officer to India to advise the Indian army before the attack on the temple. The Heywood inquiry concluded that British military advice was given, but it had a limited impact.\n\nDespite these findings, some groups suggested the review was a cover-up. Earlier this month, Angela Rayner, the Labour deputy leader, tweeted: \u2018Today we mark the 40th anniversary of the raid on the Golden Temple. Labour stands with the Sikh community in calling for an inquiry into the historic role Britain played. A Labour government will work to determine the best way to find out the truth.\u201d\n\nSikh manifesto\n\nThe Sikh Network launched the third edition of The Sikh Manifesto on 7 June. It does not represent the views of all Sikhs in Britain.\n\nIt suggests there will be one million Sikh voters on 4 July, although this figure is at odds with the 2021 Census data where 525,865 individuals identified themselves as Sikh, 0.9 per cent of the population of England and Wales. According to other national census data, there are 10,988 Sikhs in Scotland and 389 in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe manifesto makes several demands, including more effective representation of Sikh issues in parliament; promotion of a better understanding of Sikh identity and way of life; and a demand for more focus on anti-Sikh hate crime. The manifesto adds: \u201cLabour is predicted to have at least 14 Sikh MPs after 4 July 2024.\u201d\n\nThe manifesto encourages MPs to join the All-Party Parliamentary Group for British Sikhs, whose secretariat has historically been the Sikh Federation.",

        "text": "Trump\u2019s Schedule F plan, explained\nIn October 2020, the Trump Administration issued an executive order that would have stripped protections from civil servants perceived as disloyal to the president and encouraged expressions of allegiance to the president when hiring. This effort is referred to as \u201cSchedule F\u201d because that was the name of the new employment category that the executive order created.\n\nThe administration claimed the authority to create Schedule F based on statutory language that exempted certain positions \u201cof a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character\u201d from employment protections. Previous administrations and Congress always understood the language to apply only to a smaller number of positions traditionally filled by political appointees.\n\nThe Civil Service, Explained The Civil Service, Explained\n\nBecause Trump did not remain in office, it is unknown how many federal employees his administration would have swept into Schedule F, or how many would have been fired and replaced. Experts have put the possible numbers in the tens or hundreds of thousands. The Trump official credited with the idea to create Schedule F estimated that it could apply to as many as 50,000 federal workers. Some Trump allies told Axios it would not be necessary to fire that many workers because firing fewer would produce the desired \u201cbehavior change.\u201d\n\nOther former Trump officials\u2019 comments and actions led one professor who studies public administration to conclude that the 50,000 figure \u201cis probably a floor rather than a ceiling.\u201d\n\nWant more Democracy Insights? Subscribe to our weekly newsletter\n\nUltimately, the executive order calling for a new Schedule F was not implemented; the Biden Administration rescinded it before it could go into effect. On April 4, 2024, the Biden administration finalized a rule that aims to clarify and strengthen existing protections for civil servants, and to slow any future effort to undermine those protections.\n\nWhy is Schedule F being discussed?\n\nTrump has announced his intention to reissue Schedule F \u201con day one\u201d of his next administration. During his first term, government employees were frequent targets of public insults, threats, and retaliation. Echoing Trump, other elected officials have advocated \u201cfir[ing] every single mid-level bureaucrat\u201d and made campaign promises to begin \u201cslitting [bureaucrats\u2019] throats on day one.\u201d\n\nAs scholars at the American Enterprise Institute have stated, \u201c[Trump] has made it clear in countless ways that, if he were to win the presidency again, he would expect total loyalty \u2014 from cabinet secretaries down to the most junior agency employees.\u201d\n\nTo assist him, the Heritage Foundation, a prominent conservative policy organization, has organized a coalition of over 100 conservative organizations under the banner of \u201cProject 2025,\u201d an effort to prepare policy and personnel for \u201cthe next conservative president.\u201d The organization\u2019s policy agenda advocates for a revival of Schedule F as part of a larger crackdown on the civil service, and the architects of Project 2025 have plainly said that their aim is \u201cto bend or break the bureaucracy to the presidential will.\u201d\n\nWhy isn\u2019t Schedule F a positive reform?\n\nThere are legitimate concerns about the effectiveness, capacity, and accountability of civil service employees and many serious plans for reform. Those plans generally focus on how effectively the government serves the American people, including leadership and recruitment practices in the civil service, ethics, streamlining organizational charts, and encouraging innovation. Schedule F advocacy differs by explicitly promoting personal loyalty to the president.\n\nA recent article published in the journal Public Administration that reviewed 96 different studies on the relationship between meritocracy and government performance found that \u201cImpartiality and professionalism are consistently related to positive performance outcomes, higher public trust and confidence, and lower levels of corruption\u201d whereas \u201cPoliticization was negatively related to government performance, employee work attitudes (i.e., job satisfaction, organizational commitment), and impartial administration, and positively related to corruption.\u201d\n\nThe review\u2019s authors specifically related their findings to the proposed Schedule F: \u201cThe implications of the findings for Schedule F are unequivocal \u2014 converting career employees to Schedule F and removing their civil service protections is likely to degrade government performance.\u201d\n\nFor more on the importance of the civil service and the consequences of politicizing it, see our civil service explainer here.\n\nA core tenet of democracy is that the government should work on behalf of the public. It is in recognition of this principle that public officials are required to take an oath to uphold the Constitution \u2014 \u201ca reminder,\u201d in the words of Georgetown University public policy professor Donald Moynihan, \u201cthat their deepest loyalty is to something greater than whoever occupies the White House or Congress.\u201d\n\nSchedule F is an effort to redirect regulatory, administrative, and investigatory functions of the government away from the public interest and toward the president\u2019s interests. This makes it easier for an aspiring authoritarian American president to abuse his power to punish, intimidate, and silence opponents by making government aid, contracts, licenses, merger approvals, tax benefits, permits, civil penalties, relief aid, grants, and regulatory waivers contingent on showing personal fidelity.\n\nRelated content",

        "text": "What happened to H-1B visas during Trump\u2019s first term\nWith Donald Trump set for victory in the US Presidential elections, here\u2019s a look at how Trump\u2019s first term in office affected the visa program for specialty occupations, known as the H-1B.\n\nThe program allows American employers to hire non-immigrant workers in specialty occupations that require a high level of skills and at least a bachelor\u2019s degree, according to the US Department of Labour.\n\n\u201cThe intent of the H-1B provisions is to help employers who cannot otherwise obtain needed business skills and abilities from the US workforce by authorising the temporary employment of qualified individuals who are not otherwise authorised to work in the United States,\u201d the department says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe US government has capped the total number of new H-1B visas at 65,000 each financial year. Another 20,000 visas can be given to those who have obtained a Master\u2019s degree or higher from a US institution. H-1B workers employed at higher education institutions, non-profits or government research organisations are not covered by the cap.\n\nHow many Indians use the H-1B program?\n\nUS government data shows that Indians have been the majority of H-1B visa-holders in the past few years. In the fiscal year 2023, Indians accounted for 72.3% (2.79 lakh) of the total (3.86 lakh) H-1B approvals, according to a US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) report in March this year. Chinese workers were a distant second, receiving 11.7% of the total H-1B visas approved in 2023.\n\nComputer-related occupations accounted for 65% of all H-1B visas in 2023, followed by architecture, engineering and surveying (9.5%) and education (6%). The median annual compensation for H-1B visa holders in 2023 was $118,000, the report said.\n\nHow has the number of H-1Bs approved changed over the years?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a report by the American Immigration Council on October 8, the number of H-1B visa holders declined in 2020 due to the Covid-19 restrictions.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Office of Homeland Security Statistics reports that the number of H-1B recipients who were admitted into the country rose from 570,368 in FY 2018 to 601,594 in FY 2019 and then dropped to 368,440 in FY 2020. The restrictions imposed by Trump on the recipients of nonimmigrant work visas such as the H-1B expired in March 2021 and were not renewed by the Biden administration. However, admissions in H-1B status continued to drop to a low of 148,603 in FY 2021, due in large part to the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d it said.\n\nThe number of admissions increased in 2022, to 4.10 lakh and then further to 7.55 lakh in 2023. The report found that the denial rate of H-1B applications increased during the Trump administration\u2019s term, from 6% in 2016 to 24% in 2018, before reducing again to 21% in 2019, 13% in 2020 and 4% in 2021. This, the report said, was due to the increasing number of denials being overturned upon challenging. In 2022, the denial rate was down to 2%, it said.",

Read our privacy policy\n\nDonald Trump has made history as the first criminally convicted US president. He has been found guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records as part of a conspiracy to corruptly influence the 2016 presidential election.\n\nHe sat emotionless as the jury convicted him on 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up a payment to porn star Stormy Daniels in the run-up to the 2016 election. Ms Daniels says that they had a sexual encounter in 2006, which Trump denies.\n\nThe jury delivered the verdict late on 31 May after deliberating for almost two days at the Manhattan court.\n\nThe Republican presidential candidate completed a virtual interview with Manhattan Criminal Court\u2019s probation department on Monday, a mandatory requirement before he is sentenced on July 11 by New York judge Juan Merchan after being found guilty on all counts at his hush money trial last month.\n\nCould Trump go to prison? And what potential prison time is he facing in his three other criminal cases?\n\nThe \u2018hush money\u2019 case \u2013 up to 20 years\n\nThe 34 charges were \u201cstepped up\u201d from misdemeanors to class E felonies for the trial because prosecutors alleged the crimes were carried out in an effort to commit or conceal another crime.\n\nEach of the 34 counts carries a maximum sentence of four years in prison, however New York imposes a 20-year sentencing cap for this type of offense.\n\nHowever, such sentences are usually only doled out in circumstances like previous felony convictions or based on the seriousness of the crime.\n\nGiven that Trump has no prior criminal record and his crimes are non-violent, he could face no jail time. Instead, New York Judge Juan Merchan could impose other penalties such as fines, probation or conditional discharge in lieu of jail time.\n\nThe prosecution and the defense are still to give their recommendations on sentencing. The defense was due to give its recommendation on June 13. On June 10 Trump sat for a virtual interview with a probation officer as part of the sentencing procedure. Reports said the interview lasted half an hour.\n\nSome commentators have suggested the prosecution could ask for jail time although others have suggested Trump\u2019s age and lack of previous convictions make this unlikely.\n\nThe classified documents case \u2013 up to 450 years\n\nIn one of two federal criminal cases, Trump is charged with willfully retaining secrets and obstructing justice over his alleged mishandling of classified documents after leaving the White House.\n\nIn August 2022, the FBI raided Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago home in Palm Beach, Florida, and found boxes of classified documents that he should have returned to the National Archives.\n\nIn that case, the former president faces a maximum of 10 years in prison per count of willfully retaining secrets and 20 years per count of obstructing justice.\n\nopen image in gallery Donald Trump appears alongside his aide and co-defendant Walt Nauta and attorneys Chris Kise and Todd Blanche in Miami, Florida, in June 2023 ( Reuters )\n\nWhile the latter offence comes with a higher maximum sentence, it is the former which should have Trump more worried. Convictions of wilful and/or reckless retention of classified information frequently result in prison sentences of several years or more. Trump faces more than 30 of those charges.\n\nThe trial was provisionally set for 20 May, although Judge Aileen Cannon subsequently suspended it indefinitely and pretrial hearings relating to it continue to be dominated by baffling orders and courtroom spats.\n\nThe federal election interference case \u2013 up to 55 years\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s second case against Trump accuses him with efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election in his favor.\n\nIn this case, he faces charges of conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy against Americans\u2019 right to vote in free elections and attempting to block the certification of the election results by summoning a mob to attack the US Capitol on 6 January 2021.\n\nShould he be convicted on either point, he faces steep maximum prison sentences for each count, in particular the obstruction of proceeding charges, which carry 20-year maximum terms.\n\nopen image in gallery Donald Trump claimed he witnessed \u2018filth\u2019 and \u2019decay\u2019 in Washington DC after his arraignment in early August 2023 ( Getty )\n\nThe trial, in this case, was provisionally set for 4 March but it has been plagued by delays while Trump\u2019s \u201cpresidential immunity\u201d argument plays out before the US Supreme Court.\n\nThe Georgia racketeering case \u2013 up to 76.5 years\n\nIn Georgia, Trump is charged with his efforts to overturn the 2020 election in the state.\n\nopen image in gallery Donald Trump appears in a police booking mugshot released by the Fulton County Sheriff\u2019s Office in Georgia in August 2023 ( Reuters )\n\nThe sprawling RICO case, brought by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis against Trump and a string of his allies, is unique in that it is the only case where the charges carry minimum prison terms.\n\nThe most serious felony charge \u2013 of violating Georgia\u2019s RICO statute (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations) \u2013 carries a minimum prison term of five years, with a maximum of 20 behind bars.",

        "text": "ALICE COOPER Launches 2024 \u2018Presidential Campaign\u2019: \u2018I\u2019m A Troubled Man For Troubled Times\u2019\nThe original 1972 \u201cElected\u201d music video is when Cooper first announced his \u201ccandidacy\u201d and the formation of the Wild Party.\n\n\u201cElected\u201d was the first single from Cooper\u2018s iconic sixth studio album, \u201cBillion Dollar Babies\u201d. The record reached No. 1 in the U.S. and U.K. and was certified platinum by the RIAA.\n\nIn a 2018 interview with The Guardian, Cooper said that he keeps his political opinions to himself. \u201cI don\u2019t like to mix politics and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t look at Bono, Sting and Bruce Springsteen as political. I look at them as being humanitarian. I\u2019ll contribute to anything humanitarian. Helping people who can\u2019t help themselves. But when musicians are telling people who to vote for, I think that\u2019s an abuse of power. You\u2019re telling your fans not to think for themselves, just to think like you. Rock \u2018n\u2019 roll is about freedom \u2014 and that\u2019s not freedom.\u201d\n\nEight years ago, Cooper said that rock stars offering their political opinions is \u201cthe worst idea ever.\u201d \u201cFirst of all, why do people think rock stars know more than they do?\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the biggest fallacy in the world \u2014 if anything, we\u2019re dumber. We\u2019re not smarter than anybody else. I mean, why do you think we\u2019re rock stars?\n\n\u201cTrust me, we don\u2019t read magazines you don\u2019t read. Nobody calls us up and gives us as inside information on politics. We know less than you do. If I watch TV, it\u2019s \u2018Family Guy\u2019.\n\n\u201cRock \u2018n\u2019 roll was built to go as far away from politics as you could get. When my mom and dad talked about who to vote for, I\u2019d go in the other room and put on THE BEATLES or ROLLING STONES \u2014 and I\u2019m still like that.\u201d",

Pew Research Center is a nonpartisan, nonadvocacy fact tank that informs the public about the issues, attitudes and trends shaping the world. Knight Foundation is a social investor committed to supporting informed and engaged communities. Learn more >\n\nHow we did this Pew Research Center conducted this study to understand how TikTok users, X (formerly Twitter) users, Instagram users and Facebook users experience politics on these platforms. For this analysis, we surveyed 10,287 adult internet users in the United States from March 18 to 24, 2024. Everyone who took part in the survey is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way, nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey was weighted by combining the sample of internet users with data from ATP members who do not use the internet, and weighting the combined dataset to be representative of all U.S. adults by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. The analysis in this report is based on those who use the platforms of interest. Refer to the survey methodology for details. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology. Here are the questions used for this report, along with responses, and the survey methodology. This is a Pew Research Center report from the Pew-Knight Initiative, a research program funded jointly by The Pew Charitable Trusts and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. Find related reports online at https://www.pewresearch.org/pew-knight/.\n\nSocial media platforms are often at the center of the nation\u2019s political debates \u2013 from free speech and harassment to the fate of democracy itself. Companies\u2019 decisions about who and what to allow on their platforms have taken on even more weight ahead of the 2024 U.S. presidential election.\n\nResults from a Pew Research Center survey conducted in March 2024 shed new light on this environment. Americans\u2019 experiences with politics on social media often depend on the platforms they use, from TikTok and X to Facebook and Instagram.\n\nX stands out as a place people turn to for politics. A majority of X users (59%) say keeping up with politics or political issues is a reason they use it, compared with 36% of TikTok users and even smaller shares of Facebook or Instagram users (26% each).\n\nThere\u2019s a range of reasons people are drawn to social media platforms \u2013 even on X, where using it to keep up with politics is relatively common. On TikTok, Facebook and Instagram, politics takes a backseat to other reasons we explored.\n\nFor example:\n\nEntertainment largely reigns, especially on TikTok. Nearly all TikTok users (95%) say they\u2019re on it because it\u2019s entertaining, and about three-quarters or more say the same for X, Facebook and Instagram.\n\nNearly all TikTok users (95%) say they\u2019re on it because it\u2019s entertaining, and about three-quarters or more say the same for X, Facebook and Instagram. On Facebook and Instagram, friends and family are motivators. Most Facebook and Instagram users say a reason for using each is to keep up with friends and family. This share drops to 44% for TikTok and 33% for X.\n\nRelated: How Americans Get News on TikTok, X, Facebook and Instagram\n\nMore about this project This project was designed to understand how people\u2019s experiences and views differ across social media sites and apps.\n\n\n\nThe survey covered four social media platforms: TikTok, X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram. Each platform\u2019s questions were identical.\n\n\n\nThis report focuses on politics on social media. To learn about how people get news on these platforms, read the companion report.\n\nStill, people are coming across political posts as they scroll through social media. And companies\u2019 policies shape the political environment people enter when they log on.\n\nOur survey of 10,287 U.S. adult internet users, conducted March 18-24, 2024, set out to explore what this looks like on TikTok, X, Facebook and Instagram today.\n\nJump to the following sections to learn more about how experiences and views differ across these four platforms:\n\nAnd for a deep dive on one platform at a time, go to the chapter covering its users\u2019 views and experiences:\n\nThis is one of two Pew Research Center reports on habits and attitudes on different social media platforms from the Pew-Knight Initiative, a research program funded jointly by The Pew Charitable Trusts and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation.\n\nSocial media and democracy\n\nThe relationship between social media and elections has often been rocky. In 2016, platforms struggled to stop the spread of election misinformation. After 2020, they grappled with decisions to ban former President Donald Trump.\n\nNot everyone is convinced platforms are a dire threat to democracy. But as experts warn misinformation could worsen in 2024 and the Supreme Court tackles cases defining free speech on social media, the question persists: Are these platforms good for democracy?\n\nWe\u2019ve asked this question about X (formerly Twitter) before \u2013 once in 2021, before Elon Musk took over the platform and revamped it, and again in 2023.\n\nToday, views of X are more positive than negative. About four-in-ten X users (38%) say it\u2019s mostly good for democracy, 27% say it\u2019s mostly bad, and 34% say it has no impact. That\u2019s an uptick of 6 percentage points in the share who say it\u2019s mostly good from last year.\n\nGOP users\u2019 views of X have changed dramatically in the past three years. The share of Republican users who see X as mostly good for democracy has roughly tripled from 17% in 2021 to 53% today. This includes a 10-point rise in just the past year (from 43% to 53%). (Throughout this report, Democratic and Republican users include independents who lean toward each party.)\n\nDemocratic X users\u2019 views are trending negative. The share of Democratic users who see it as mostly bad for democracy has risen 11 points since 2021, to 39% today.\n\nPartisans hold opposing views of X. Republican X users are far more likely than Democratic users to see it as mostly good for democracy (53% vs. 26%). In contrast, Democratic users are three times as likely as their GOP counterparts to see it as mostly bad (39% vs. 13%).\n\nFor the first time, we asked this question about Facebook, Instagram and TikTok. We found that not everyone thinks these platforms play a role in the democratic process.\n\nFor Instagram, TikTok and Facebook, the most common view is that each has no impact on democracy. Over half of Instagram users say so, as do 49% of TikTok users and 43% of Facebook users.\n\nOtherwise, views of TikTok and Instagram are more positive than negative. A third of TikTok users say it\u2019s mostly good, versus 17% who say it\u2019s mostly bad.\n\nSimilarly, 26% of Instagram users say it\u2019s mostly good, compared with 16% who say it\u2019s mostly bad.\n\nOn the other hand, views of Facebook are more negative than positive: 31% of Facebook users think it\u2019s mostly bad, while 24% say it\u2019s mostly good. But the largest share (43%) says it has no impact.\n\nSeeing and sharing politics\n\nX is the only platform where a majority of users cite politics as a reason they use it. But people on TikTok, Facebook and Instagram still come across political content.\n\nHow much political content do people see \u2013 and share?\n\nLike with reasons for use, X leads in how much politics its users see. Most X users (74%) say at least some of what they see on it is about politics or political issues. Smaller shares of users say the same for Facebook (52%), TikTok (45%) and Instagram (36%).\n\nPeople are far more likely to see politics than share about it. Just 14% of X users say at least some of what they post or share on it is about politics or political issues. About one-in-ten Facebook, TikTok and Instagram users say the same. .\n\nOn each platform, Republicans and Democrats are similarly likely to see at least some political content there \u2013 and that\u2019s also true for sharing it. For example, identical shares of Republican and Democratic TikTok users (47% each) see at least some political content there. (Refer to the Appendix for these shares for all four platforms.)\n\nWhich way does political content on platforms lean?\n\nAccusations of political bias and censorship on platforms have been widespread in recent years, both in the news and among the general public. But what do users of these platforms think about the content they see?\n\nAcross all four platforms we studied, some users don\u2019t see a clear lean to one side in the content they consume. About four-in-ten or more say that what they see about politics doesn\u2019t lean toward a particular ideology or that they are unsure. For example, 53% of Facebook users say what they see doesn\u2019t lean either way (24%) or that they are unsure (29%).\n\nStill, Instagram, Facebook and TikTok users are more likely to say what they see is mostly liberal than mostly conservative. About a quarter on each platform say what they see is mostly liberal. Smaller shares perceive a conservative lean.\n\nX users are about evenly split between thinking what they see leans liberal (19%) versus conservative (18%). Another 31% say it doesn\u2019t lean either way.\n\nDifferences by party\n\nParty differences depend on which platform we\u2019re looking at. For example, Republicans who use Facebook are more likely than Democrats to say the political content they come across there is mostly liberal (29% vs. 16%). Their Democratic counterparts are slightly more likely to say the content is mostly conservative (16% vs. 10%).\n\nOn the other hand, on X, Republicans are more likely than Democrats to say what they see doesn\u2019t lean either way (37% vs. 26%). But Democratic users are somewhat more likely than Republican users to say what they see there leans liberal (22% vs. 16%).\n\nThere are also slight party differences on Instagram and TikTok (refer to the back chapters for more).\n\nWhy people do \u2013 or don\u2019t \u2013 post about politics\n\nTo understand more about what motivates people to post (or not), we followed up with two groups of users.\n\nWhy people post about politics\n\nWe asked users who say they post at least a little political content on these platforms about four reasons why they might do so.\n\nPolitics belonging there: About two-thirds of those who share things about politics on TikTok or X say a reason why is that politics belongs there. Far fewer on Instagram (45%) or Facebook (40%) say this.\n\nMaking a difference: About three-quarters of users who post political content on TikTok (73%) say it\u2019s because this is a place they can make a difference. By comparison, smaller shares post political content on X (58%) or Facebook (54%) for this reason. (The share who say this about Instagram \u2013 64% \u2013 is statistically similar to both TikTok and X.)\n\nFeeling obligated: Roughly three-quarters of those who post about politics on X or TikTok say feeling it\u2019s something they should do is a reason why they do so, along with a similar share of their peers on Instagram (70%). Among Facebook users who share politics there, 63% cite this as a reason.\n\nA welcoming environment: Most TikTok and X users who post about politics also say their views feeling welcome there is a reason they do so \u2013 higher than the shares on the other platforms.\n\nDifferences by party\n\nFor some platforms, we were also able to explore how these reasons might vary by party. For example, on X, Republican users who post about politics are more likely than their Democratic counterparts to cite their views being welcome there as a major reason why they do so (54% vs. 33%).\n\nConversely, on Facebook, Republicans who post about politics are less likely than their Democratic peers to cite a welcoming environment as a major reason they post about politics (12% vs. 20%).\n\nWhy people steer clear of posting about politics\n\nWe also asked users who say they post on the platforms, but never about politics or political issues, about four reasons why they might avoid doing so.\n\nPolitics not belonging there: A majority of Facebook (67%) and Instagram (60%) users who keep politics out of their posts say it\u2019s because politics doesn\u2019t belong there. Smaller shares say the same for TikTok (47%) or X (36%).\n\nThe threat of harassment: Similar shares of Facebook (48%) and Instagram (44%) users who avoid posting politics say it\u2019s because they don\u2019t want to be criticized or harassed there. A smaller share of their counterparts on TikTok (35%) say the same. (The share who says this about X doesn\u2019t statistically differ from the other platforms.)\n\nTo learn about those who don\u2019t care or don\u2019t think it\u2019ll make a difference, and for more on how reasons rank within a platform, refer to the back chapters on TikTok, X, Facebook and Instagram.\n\nDifferences by party\n\nAgain, we were able to explore how these reasons differed by party for some platforms. For example, on Facebook, Republicans who avoid posting about politics are slightly more likely than Democrats to say politics not belonging there is a major reason they don\u2019t post this (49% vs. 42%).\n\nThere is a similar pattern for Instagram: 44% of Republicans versus 36% of Democrats say a major reason they avoid this is because politics doesn\u2019t belong there.\n\nFree speech and harassment\n\nSocial media platforms\u2019 decisions about what content to allow can be consequential. Elon Musk has declared X a place for free speech, but some say its policies have the opposite effect. Meta has moved to limit political content on its platforms, including Facebook and Instagram. And TikTok has come under fire for alleged censorship, including by those posting about #BlackLivesMatter.\n\nWe wanted to hear from each platform\u2019s user base: Do platforms feel like places for open political expression?\n\nMost users think people feel free to express political views on these platforms. About nine-in-ten X users and a similar share of TikTok users think so. Three-quarters of Instagram users and 71% of Facebook users say the same.\n\nMajorities of users across the political aisle say this, but Republican users are less likely than Democrats to think people feel free to talk about politics on Facebook, Instagram and TikTok. For example, they are more skeptical about free expression on Facebook: 35% of Republican Facebook users think people do not feel free to express political views there, compared with 20% of Democrats.\n\nHowever, similar shares across parties see X as a place for free expression. About nine-in-ten Republican users think people there feel free to express political views, and roughly the same share of Democratic users say so.\n\nHarassment\n\nWith open expression can come anger and abuse. Our previous work shows that while online harassment occurs in a wide range of places from gaming to dating apps, it most often occurs on social media sites. And a rising share of Americans have been harassed online because of their political beliefs.\n\nHarassment is widely seen as a problem on each of these sites. Roughly eight-in-ten Facebook users say this is a problem there, including 31% who say it\u2019s a major one.\n\nSmaller shares of X, TikTok and Instagram users \u2013 though still about seven-in-ten \u2013 see harassment as a problem on these sites.\n\nThe extent to which people think harassment is a problem differs by party, especially on X. Democratic users are about three times as likely as Republican users to say harassment is a major problem (48% vs. 15%).\n\nPartisan differences are more modest for other sites. For example, 35% of Democrats who use Facebook see harassment as a major issue on the site, compared with 26% of Republican users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Hunter Biden convicted on gun charges: Will he go to jail?\nSentencing to take place at latest by October 9, about a month before his father, US President Joe Biden, seeks re-election.\n\nHunter Biden, the son of United States President Joe Biden, has been found guilty of illegally buying a gun while under the influence of drugs in 2018, becoming the first child of a sitting president to be a convicted felon.\n\nThe younger Biden, 54, showed little reaction to the verdict on Tuesday and left the Delaware courthouse holding hands with his wife Melissa Cohen Biden and first lady Jill Biden.\n\nHere is all you need to know about the conviction:\n\nWhat is Hunter Biden convicted of?\n\nHunter Biden was indicted on September 14 on three counts regarding a 2018 purchase of a Colt Cobra .38 Special revolver from a gun shop in Wilmington, Delaware, the Bidens\u2019 hometown.\n\nHe was found guilty of making a false claim on the application to buy the gun by saying he was not a drug user and was convicted of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer.\n\nHunter Biden was also found guilty of knowingly owning the gun while being an unlawful drug user. He owned the pistol for 11 days in October 2018.\n\nA 12-member jury\u2018s guilty verdicts concluded a trial that began on June 3.\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s myriad personal woes made their way into the trial with two of his ex-girlfriends testifying in court \u2013 Hallie Biden, who was married to Hunter\u2019s late brother, Beau Biden, and Zoe Kestan. Hallie Biden told the court she found the revolver in his truck and threw it in a dumpster out of fear while Kestan told the court that she witnessed Hunter Biden use crack cocaine at luxury hotels.\n\nWill Hunter Biden go to prison?\n\nAccording to the US Department of Justice, Hunter Biden could face up to 25 years in prison.\n\nSuch a sentence is unlikely, given Hunter Biden is a nonviolent, first-time offender. He might face a much shorter sentence or even probation instead of prison, legal experts said.\n\nWhen is Hunter Biden\u2019s sentencing?\n\nDistrict Judge Maryellen Noreika has not specified a sentencing date but said it will take place within 120 days of the verdict.\n\nThis means the sentencing will take place at the latest by October 9, less than a month before Joe Biden faces former President Donald Trump in the US presidential election on November 5.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s defence attorney Abbe Lowell released a statement on Tuesday saying they will \u201ccontinue to vigorously pursue all the legal challenges available\u201d.\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s legal team can argue that the firearm was not used in a crime. In fact, it was not used at all during the 11 days he possessed it.\n\nAdditionally, they might note that he has been sober since 2019.\n\nWill the conviction affect the election in November?\n\nHis son\u2019s conviction is a big blow to Joe Biden ahead of the election.\n\nThe trial began days after Trump was convicted of falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment he made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels after a sexual encounter. The cover-up was carried out before the 2016 presidential election, which Trump won.\n\nBiden supporters have amplified Trump\u2019s felony convictions, but the former president\u2019s supporters say the slew of legal cases against him are politically orchestrated.\n\nThey have pointed out that Noreika and another federal judge, Mark Scarsi, who is overseeing a tax case against Hunter Biden, were appointed by Trump.\n\nCostas Panagopoulos, head of Northeastern University\u2019s Department of Political Science, said in an interview with the university\u2019s news website that Hunter Biden\u2019s and Trump\u2019s convictions reinforce that the US judicial system is working under President Biden, contradicting Trump\u2019s allegation that it is rigged.\n\nAdditionally, because this is a federal case, Joe Biden holds the power to pardon his son. However, the White House has explicitly ruled this out.\n\nAfter the verdict was announced, President Biden said he would accept the outcome of the case and \u201cwill continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal\u201d.\n\nWhat other charges does Hunter Biden face?\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s legal woes do not end here as he also faces tax evasion charges. He has pleaded not guilty in that case. His trial is expected to begin on September 5 in Los Angeles.\n\nProsecutors allege that Hunter Biden evaded $1.4m in taxes from 2016 to 2019. If convicted, he faces a prison term of up to 17 years.",

        "text": "North Dakota sets age limit for US Congressional candidates\nNorth Dakota sets age limit for Congress candidates\n\nThe measure prevents older candidates from appearing on ballots. If a court ruling requires someone to appear on a ballot, the ballot will also include their expected age at the end of the term.\n\nIt passed among voters in one of the least populated US states on Tuesday with a majority of votes - 61%. Nearly 40% of voters opposed it.\n\nThe ballot measure changes the state's constitution to bar North Dakota candidates from representing the state in the US House or Senate if they turn 81 by 31 December of the year when their term ends.\n\nVoters in North Dakota have approved a new candidate age limit that would prevent anyone from running for Congress if they turn 81 during their term.\n\nNorth Dakota's current congressional delegation will not be impacted by the measure. Sen. John Hoeven is the oldest member of the group at 67.\n\nVoters' approval of the law is one of the first measurable indicators of how Americans feel about the age of their representatives.\n\nThe issue is in the spotlight ahead of the November presidential election, when voters will choose between US President Joe Biden, who is 81, and former US President Donald Trump, who is turning 78 this week.\n\nRegardless of which candidates wins, they would become the oldest serving US president - a title President Biden currently holds.\n\nHowever, the North Dakota ballot measure is likely to face legal challenges.\n\nThe US Constitution says senators must be at least 30 years old and members of the House at least 25 years old. There are no term limits or retirement requirements for Congress.\n\nThe US Supreme Court ruled in 1995 that states do not have the authority to establish eligibility rules for congressional candidates. The decision, U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, determined that states can not impose additional restrictions on federal government representatives beyond what is included in the US Constitution.\n\nThe Supreme Court separately affirmed that states cannot set their own requirements for national office in March, when it rejected an effort to remove Trump from Colorado's primary ballot.\n\nThe North Dakota Attorney General's office estimated the age limit measure could lead to an estimated $1m (\u00a3780,000) in litigation costs.\n\nThere are currently three senators older than age 80 - Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, 82, a Republican from Kentucky; Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, 82; and Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, 90.\n\nMr McConnell garnered attention last year after several episodes in which he appeared to freeze in front of TV cameras, raising questions about his health and competency. Mr McConnell has said he is \"completely recovered\" after the episodes.\n\nAt least 10 current House members are older than 80, including Democrat Steny Hoyer of Maryland, 84; Democrat Nancy Pelosi of California, 84 and Democrat James Clyburn of South Carolina, 83.",

        "text": "Biden-Harris Administration Announces National Strategy to Reduce Food Loss and Waste and Recycle Organics\nJoint efforts will reduce waste, increase recycling of organics, reduce climate pollution, save families and businesses money, and support a circular economy for all\n\nWASHINGTON, June 12, 2024 - Today, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the White House announced the National Strategy for Reducing Food Loss and Waste and Recycling Organics as part of President Biden\u2019s whole-of-government approach to tackle climate change, feed people, address environmental justice, and promote a circular economy.\n\nThe strategy released today provides tangible goals that the U.S. government partners along with retailers and consumers can work toward to help further prevent the loss and waste of food, increase recycling of food and other organic materials to support a more circular economy for all, reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, save households and businesses money, and build cleaner, healthier communities. This strategy is also a deliverable in the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s National Strategy on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health, released in conjunction with the historic White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health in September 2022.\n\n\u201cUSDA is committed to reducing food loss and waste, facilitating many programs and activities to engage farmers, producers, communities and businesses in this collective effort,\u201d said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. \u201cThis National Strategy charts a course to reduce our nation\u2019s food loss and waste by 50% by 2030, and I am encouraged by the actions outlined for USDA and our federal partners. Everyone has a role to play in reducing food loss and waste, and I hope that these federal commitments will inspire and catalyze action in the private sector and communities around the U.S.\u201d\n\n\u201cEach year food produced in the United States ends up in landfills, instead of on American dinner tables. This waste hurts our economy, raises the cost of food, and contributes to climate pollution,\u201d said EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan. \u201cThe National Strategy we are announcing today provides a comprehensive set of actions that EPA and our partners at USDA and FDA will take to reduce waste and protect our environment while improving food security and saving money for families and businesses.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe FDA is committed to completing the actions outlined in the National Strategy that incentivize and encourage food loss and waste prevention and organics recycling,\u201d said FDA Commissioner Robert M. Califf, M.D. \u201cAlong with the FDA, USDA and EPA efforts, U.S. consumers and retailers play an important role in meeting the National Strategy\u2019s goal of reducing food loss and waste by 2030. As part of the release of this strategy, the FDA has made important resources available to guide, support, and accelerate their food loss and waste activities including the 2022 Food Code, Tips to Reduce Food Waste and the Food Loss and Waste Social Media Toolkit. We encourage all stakeholders to take advantage of these resources as we work together to reduce food loss and waste.\u201d\n\nToday, Secretary Vilsack announced the strategy during his keynote remarks at the ReFED Food Waste Solutions Summit in Baltimore, Md. The summit is the largest national food waste event of the year, bringing together food businesses, funders, solution providers, innovators, policymakers, nonprofits, and more to drive the adoption of food waste solutions. He spoke about how the strategy advances USDA\u2019s goals to enhance agriculture\u2019s ability to address global food and nutrition security, manage the consequences of climate change, and engage in innovative practices.\n\nRecent EPA research shows that 58% of methane emissions released to the atmosphere from landfills are from food waste. Each year in the U.S., food loss and waste create potent greenhouse gas pollutants equal to the emissions of 60 coal-fired power plants. The strategy aims to prevent and divert organic waste from landfills to reduce GHG emissions and highlights opportunities, especially where there are environmental justice concerns, to build community-scale organics recycling infrastructure, reduce pollution, and create jobs.\n\nThe strategy drives progress toward the National Food Loss and Waste Reduction Goal to reduce the loss and waste of food by 50% by 2030. In 2021, EPA updated its U.S. baseline to align the 2030 goal with the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goal Target 12.3, which aims to reduce the amount of food from food retail, food service, and households that has been removed from the human supply chain. In addition, this goal supports the U.S. Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan. Because methane is both a powerful GHG and short-lived compared to carbon dioxide, achieving significant reductions to food loss and waste would have a rapid and significant effect on reducing GHG emissions.\n\nThe strategy highlights four objectives:\n\nObjective 1: Prevent food loss.\n\nObjective 2: Prevent food waste.\n\nObjective 3: Increase the recycling rate for all organic waste.\n\nObjective 4: Support policies that incentivize and encourage the prevention of food loss and waste and organics recycling.\n\nFor each objective, the strategy highlights actions that USDA, EPA, and FDA could take. Some of the priority USDA actions include:\n\nInvesting $2.5 million from USDA\u2019s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) to rigorously test and measure the effectiveness of different consumer messages to encourage households to reduce food waste, in preparation for a National Wasted Food Prevention Campaign.\n\nFunding a new NIFA $1.5 million Center for Research, Behavioral Economics, and Extension on Food Loss and Waste to create meaningful momentum on food loss and waste prevention among land-grant universities, their partners and external stakeholders.\n\nFunding research and development on new food loss and waste innovations, such as innovative new packaging technology and cultivars to extend the shelf life of food and prevent loss.\n\nThe Risk Management Agency (RMA) is working with farmers, crop insurance agents, and gleaning organizations to encourage the reduction of on-farm food loss.\n\nThe strategy also highlights the importance of public-private partnerships in reducing food loss and waste. On June 1, the three agencies renewed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Food Waste Reduction Alliance (FWRA), which is comprised of the Consumer Brands Association, FMI \u2013 The Food Industry Association, and the National Restaurant Association. This public-private partnership will explore actions to reach industry sectors, through efforts such as targeted industry resources, tools, and guidance.\n\nAdditionally, USDA and EPA have been actively growing the U.S. Food Loss and Waste 2030 Champions pledge, through which food business have publicly committed to reducing food loss and waste by 50% by 2030 in their U.S. operations. 2030 Champions include industry giants such as Starbucks, Hilton, and Kroger. Today, USDA is also releasing the Milestones Report (PDF, 2.0 MB), which highlights the food loss and waste-reducing actions taken by some of the 2030 Champions and the impact of these actions.\n\nThe National Strategy builds on USDA\u2019s prior work to reduce food loss and waste, including over $60 million in investments and activities that USDA has undertaken to reduce food loss and waste, including those announced in May.\n\nFor more information about Food Loss and Waste Reduction activities visit:\n\nUSDA touches the lives of all Americans each day in so many positive ways.

        "text": "Mexico\u2019s bloodiest election in history sends new asylum-seekers to the US border\nSasabe, Arizona CNN \u2014\n\nNorma regrets ever having called the police.\n\nA shop owner and local coordinator for a political party on the outskirts of Mexico City, Norma called authorities in November to file a complaint about noise coming from the building next door to her house. The building was being used by a rival political party, she believes.\n\nNorma doesn\u2019t know what resulted from the police investigation, but the 35-year-old began receiving intimidating threats. Strange men began to approach her in the street and warn she didn\u2019t have long to live, she said.\n\nShe tried moving to a relative\u2019s house, but noticed that she was being followed on the way.\n\nWhen that rival party won the municipal elections two weeks ago, Norma decided to leave town, she said, fearing that she would be further targeted. \u201cAfter the vote, it got ugly in my city,\u201d she said. CNN is using only her first name due to concerns for her safety.\n\nCNN met Norma on a dusty road in southern Arizona, just moments after she and her three children \u2013 13, 8 and 2 years old \u2013 climbed across the low fence that separates Mexico from the United States.\n\nThey are among several migrant families on the border who told CNN they were fleeing the fallout of Mexico\u2019s bloody national elections, which saw dozens of political candidates assassinated and hundreds threatened on the campaign trail.\n\nAll said they hoped for asylum from the US government. And all said they had not heard of a new executive order by US President Joe Biden blocking asylum requests from most people illegally crossing the southern border during periods of high volume.\n\nA few miles east along the border, CNN met several more Mexican families who had been sheltering for days in a tent erected by a local humanitarian group. Bottles of water had been left out for them, along with signs warning to wait for Border Patrol agents to show up, rather than attempt to walk any further under the hot sun.\n\nSome were fleeing general violence, a lack of jobs, kidnapping threats made to their families. Two men with a family sitting on the ground in the stifling heat said they too had fled Mexico following the elections. They had received threats for supporting the wrong candidate in their town, one said.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t vote for the candidate \u2013 they were forcing us to.\u201d\n\nA family fleeing political threats waits to be apprehended after crossing the US-Mexico border into Arizona. Norma Galeana/CNN\n\nA wave of political killings and threats\n\nUS officials have been keeping watch for new migration surges this summer. The violence surrounding Mexico\u2019s election this month is just one of many factors pushing some families to try to cross the border.\n\n\u201cWhether we\u2019re talking about elections in Mexico or here in the US, it always provokes a level of uncertainty with everyone, generally, but especially in the migrant population,\u201d a Homeland Security official previously told CNN.\n\nThe June 2 vote was the biggest and most violent in Mexico\u2019s history. With 20,000 electoral positions up for grabs, the scale of bloodshed committed by those attempting to influence the vote was massive; at least 34 political candidates assassinated by criminal organizations during the campaign season.\n\nA May 28 report by research group Integralia identified 749 victims of political violence in Mexico, including 231 killings. Hundreds of candidates reported being threatened, and many dropped out of their races, fearing for their lives.\n\nIntimidation was particularly pervasive in local-level elections, experts told CNN, where races could hand the winners broad control over small communities\u2019 police and fiscal resources.\n\n\u201cThe violence and threats were being done specifically to have the impact of saying that this party or these people or this group \u2013 whatever it may be \u2013 is in control here. To create that environment of fear,\u201d said Carin Zissis, a Mexico expert and editor-in-chief of the Americas Society/Council\u2019s website.\n\nZissis told CNN she was not surprised political violence might be displacing some Mexicans from their homes today, given a broader security crisis in the country, where the homicide rate is one of the highest in the world.\n\nHundreds of people faced threats during the election campaign, she said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking the candidates themselves, politicians in the parties, officials in the parties, violence against family members of candidates. So you can imagine that the issue of violence in general in Mexico \u2013 which is potentially getting people to leave their communities and flee \u2013 this could overlap with political violence as well,\u201d she said.\n\nEven while ballots were being counted, the attacks continued. One mayor, Yolanda S\u00e1nchez Figueroa of Cotija in Michoac\u00e1n state, was assassinated the day after the election, while she was walking from a gym back to her house with her bodyguard. Both were shot dead by people in a white van, the state attorney general said in a statement.\n\nUS-Mexico cooperation on border control\n\nMexico has worked closely with the US to ease migratory pressure at the border, with multiple state agencies working to block or redirect asylum-seekers from around the world away from the US-Mexico border. But conditions at home appear to be pushing some Mexican citizens to join the northward flow.\n\nSalvador Guerrero, director of the Alaide Foppa Refugee Legal Clinic in Mexico City, said he worries the government\u2019s commitment to serving as a migration buffer for its northern neighbor has siphoned away resources and attention from interior security work.\n\n\u201cFor example, the National Guard was created to protect Mexico,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cBut for each criminal that the National Guard present to a judge, there are 80 migrants that they also present to relocate people from the north to the south,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, impunity reigns in Mexico, where in addition to the high homicide rate, more than 100,000 people have gone missing with no explanation of their fate. According to think tank Mexico Evalua, around 95% of all crimes nationwide went unsolved in 2022.\n\nAnd while outgoing President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador\u2019s social welfare programs have lifted many Mexicans out of poverty, the erosion of democratic guardrails and institutions under his watch are piling pressure on those who find themselves on the wrong side politically.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback On GPS: Is Mexico's democracy dying? 05:57 - Source: CNN\n\nHigh on Lopez Obrador\u2019s agenda before he leaves office is a list of reforms, many of which are expected to have a weakening effect on the day-in, day-out work of democratic institutions in the country, pointed out Zissis, the AS/COA editor.\n\nThese include eliminating proportional representation of legislators, gutting of autonomous regulatory agencies, and direct election of Supreme Court justices. The ruling Morena party says such measures are designed to create a more direct democracy, but critics say they will erode checks and balances in the government.\n\n\u201cThese may seem like tedious questions but they have a real impact on the country\u2019s democracy and the ability of opposition parties to still have a voice,\u201d Zissis said.\n\nPresident-elect Claudia Sheinbaum will begin her presidency on October 1. Widely seen as the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Lopez Obrador, whether she will continue in his footprints on security, border control and government reform are key questions amid historic levels of migration through North America.\n\nSent back with little fanfare\n\nTo reach Arizona, Norma\u2019s family took a flight to Hermosillo, and then a truck to a frontier town in the scorching Sonoran desert before eventually crossing the border on foot.\n\nShe said they walked through dry scrub and mesquite trees for about 20 minutes before reaching a ditch filled with the abandoned water bottles, diapers, ID cards and clothing \u2013 left by the hundreds of migrants who had already reached the land of the free.\n\nHer children were protective as Norma stopped to chat with CNN, her 13-year-old worried that people in Mexico would see her mother\u2019s picture on television. Even the two-year-old hugged her leg and pulled at her shirt, trying to hurry her along. \u201cMama,\u201d the toddler squeaked. \u201cVamos.\u201d\n\nBut the tent at the end of the road would be a long walk for little legs. The temperature was 111 degrees Fahrenheit (43.8 Celsius). They would find no food, water, or air conditioning there \u2013 just dozens of other dazed looking families sprawled on the floor, waiting to be apprehended so that they could tell someone why they were there.\n\nA sign left by humanitarians warning migrants and asylum seekers not to leave the isolated desert shelter. Norma Galeana/CNN\n\nFor most people crossing that border illegally today, requesting asylum is no longer an option, no matter what their circumstances. US President Joe Biden\u2019s proclamation bars migrants who cross the border illegally from seeking asylum once a daily threshold of illegal crossings is met. Though asylum seekers can still use a Customs and Border Protection app to request an appointment to present their asylum claim at a port of entry.\n\nIt\u2019s a controversial measure. Critics argue the change doesn\u2019t go far enough in stemming the vast numbers of people entering the country that far exceeds the capacity of US immigration systems. Immigrant rights advocates warn closing the border to asylum seekers endangers vulnerable people and ultimately makes the border less safe.\n\nNorma and her kids were detained by Border Patrol on Friday after entering the US. By Monday, they had been deported to Mexico, where she says they are afraid to leave the house, and her kids are not going to school.\n\nThey were treated with respect by the US agents, she told CNN, who swabbed them for DNA \u2013 likely to ensure that the children were really hers.\n\nBut she never got a chance to explain what she was running from, she said.\n\n\u201cThey just said that wasn\u2019t an option,\u201d she told CNN on Monday, speaking on the phone from her home in Mexico.\n\nPrevious reporting by CNN\u2019s Priscilla Alvarez, Tara John and David Shortell.",

        "text": "US election: its impact on US trade policy\nUS election: its impact on US trade policy\n\nWed, 12th Jun 2024\n\nEIU\u2019s forecasts continue to assume that Joe Biden, the current US president, will win re-election in November 2024. Nevertheless, the high risk of Donald Trump returning to the White House cannot be ruled out.\n\nTrade policy will be among the biggest risks to watch regarding a potential second Trump presidency. In this article, we examine how Mr Trump would approach US trade relations beyond China, including in regard to a US-Mexico-Canada Agreement ( USMCA ) renewal and the likelihood of new tariffs and other restrictions against US trade partners.\n\n( ) Despite Mr Trump\u2019s threats to impose a 10% blanket tariff across all imports, we view the full adoption of such a measure as our \u201cworst case\u201d scenario. Instead, pushback from US economic partners, domestic US firms and members of Mr Trump\u2019s own party will yield a \u201cwatered down\u201d version of this threat, including via carve-outs and other exemptions offered on a targeted basis.\n\nWe see other trade frictions around steel, aluminium, automotives and digital services taxes as potential triggers for new trade wars, particularly as the US enhances its trade policy scrutiny over third markets and continues to withdraw from global multilateral institutions.\n\nOur core forecasts continue to assume that Mr Biden will retain the presidency, despite the very high risk that Mr Trump could return to the White House. In the first of our two articles looking at the impact of the US elections, we discussed our views on US-China trade, and how the two candidates would differ in their approach to the US\u2019s economic relations with China. In the second article of this two-part series, we examine what the elections would mean for US trade policy more generally\u2014including for key US economic and security partners, many of whom we see as disproportionately exposed to the risks of a second Trump presidency.\n\nAll eyes on USMCA renewal\n\nWe see trade developments in North America as among the most riskiest areas of policy attention, besides the US\u2019s focus on China. A second Biden administration would continue to leverage the economic linkages enshrined under the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), particularly as part of its industrial policy and supply-chain securitisation goals. We would expect the Biden administration\u2014co-operating with the new, more business-friendly Mexican administration (starting from October 2024)\u2014to prioritise USMCA\u2019s scheduled renewal in 2026, which our forecast assumes will happen regardless of the Canadian elections in October 2025.\n\nBy contrast, another Trump administration would re-inject considerable uncertainty into North American trade relations. The US\u2019s growing trade deficit with Canada and Mexico would likely be among his areas of focus. Although USMCA would initially shield Canada and Mexico from Mr Trump\u2019s flat-tariff plans, any one of the trade disputes inherited from the Biden administration could easily ignite into a more serious diplomatic issue.\n\nIntense lobbying by the business community should be enough to ensure USMCA\u2019s renewal in 2026 under Mr Trump. However, Mr Trump inevitably would threaten to derail the process (or even exit the agreement) by criticising non-compliance with USMCA terms by Canada and Mexico. In addition to addressing existing concerns raised by domestic US industry\u2014some of which the Biden administration has already raised in bilateral negotiations\u2014Mr Trump may also do this in order to force policy concessions from the other members. These threats would weigh on North America\u2019s business climate, at the expense of foreign investment and cross-border trade. US-Canada relations would be strained from the start, given Mr Trump\u2019s already-hostile relationship with Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau; Canadian authorities are already moving to shield themselves from any potential fallout in diplomatic or trade ties. Ties with Mexico would also be strained, as Mr Trump quickly moves to pressure Mexico into contributing more to US-Mexico border security, potentially under the threat of trade retaliation. China\u2019s growing investment footprint in Mexico would be another source of tension (we would expect a Biden administration to handle this more delicately), as would Mexico\u2019s widening trade surplus with the US (which reached a record high in 2023).\n\nIs a 10% blanket import tariff likely?\n\nMr Trump\u2019s threat to impose a 10% import tariff across all US-bound imports represents the other main potential shock to global trade. These policy designs would also risk undermining our forecasts for US consumption and investment in 2025-28, while elevating the likelihood of economic retaliation by other governments.\n\nIt is also highly likely that a 10% blanket tariff would return strong domestic inflationary pressures to the US. Classical economic theory suggests that higher US import barriers would help to facilitate an expansion in domestic production, which would ultimately contain some inflationary pressures. However, we do not expect such an equilibrium to materialise until the medium- to long term, based partly on our assessments around the current difficulties in US industrial policies\u2014like the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act\u2014in quickly translating to expanded levels of US domestic production. A 10% blanket tariff would therefore yield an immediate, one-time surge in price pressures, with a strong risk that any new price equilibrium, once costs come down, would still be higher than the pre-status quo, based on the higher input and production costs in the US economy.\n\nThese supply-side shocks would disrupt recent disinflationary trends and probably push consumer price growth back above 4%\u2014a shock that we assume would be most prominently felt in 2025-26. In turn, this would likely encourage the Federal Reserve (the US central bank) to keep interest rates elevated (or even raise them, depending on the intensity of the inflationary shock). The knock-on effects of tighter monetary policy on household, business and investment demand would, consequently, drag down US imports in 2026-28 beyond our current assumptions, carrying wider implications for other regions that rely heavily on US demand.\n\nCould Mr Trump actually deliver on this threat?\n\nMr Trump\u2019s full implementation of a blanket 10% import tariff\u2014and the resulting retaliation by US trade partners\u2014nevertheless remains our worst-case scenario. We would expect significant political, consumer and business community pushback against these policy proposals, including by challenging the legality of Mr Trump\u2019s moves via the US courts.\n\nAs we had observed in his first term, the more likely scenario is that Mr Trump would implement a \u201cwatered down\u201d version of this threat, with tariff rates and exemptions ranging across the board\u2014particularly for key US industries (like automotives), as well as US diplomatic partners from whom Mr Trump would be seeking other economic and security concessions. The secondary effects of higher tariffs could be offset by exchange-rate movements elsewhere. An anticipated depreciation in the Chinese renminbi or the Mexican peso against the US dollar, as investors react negatively to these moves, could ultimately offset the effects of higher US duties.\n\nThe difficulty in adopting a 10% blanket tariff suggests that the earliest duties would not be adopted until late 2025/early 2026. Even so, a 10% tariff \u201cwith caveats\u201d would have significant negative implications for business confidence. Worsening investor uncertainty would hold back some investment, both domestic and foreign, into the US in 2025-28. More consequentially for global trade, such a radically protectionist measure would encourage US trade partners to adopt reciprocal duties. A \u201cdomino effect\u201d of tit-for-tat retaliation would risk market-access shocks to US exporters, particularly in politically sensitive export-oriented industries, such as agriculture and automotives. We would also expect these trade frictions to undermine the US trade and diplomatic co-ordination that the Biden administration has forged with its international partners since assuming office. This would include undermining US cooperation with the EU on China, including in regard to shared concerns over Chinese electric vehicle exports and other issues tied to Chinese industrial overcapacity.\n\nOther triggers for trade war(s)\n\nOther trade policy risks will be important to watch, and could materialise regardless of whether Mr Biden or Mr Trump returns to the White House. These could include:\n\nUS tariff threats on steel and aluminium, given US domestic political factors that have kept these industries in the crosshairs of bipartisan focus. We would expect Mr Biden to keep these tariffs suspended indefinitely, as part of leverage in ongoing trade negotiations; by contrast, Mr Trump would likely reimpose them immediately.\n\ngiven US domestic political factors that have kept these industries in the crosshairs of bipartisan focus. We would expect Mr Biden to keep these tariffs suspended indefinitely, as part of leverage in ongoing trade negotiations; by contrast, Mr Trump would likely reimpose them immediately. Tensions over planned digital services taxes (DSTs), which are tied to ongoing negotiations over the OECD\u2019s global tax deal. Although Mr Biden would persist with these negotiations, we would expect Mr Trump to exit the agreement. This would spark a wave of DST adoption in countries across Asia, Europe and North America, which could ignite tit-for-tat sanctions (and further complicate USMCA renewal, given Canada\u2019s own DST plans).\n\nwhich are tied to ongoing negotiations over the OECD\u2019s global tax deal.

This would severely undermine the US\u2019s credibility among IPEF\u2019s members amid the country\u2019s concurrent efforts to encourage Asian markets to diversify their economic, trade and supply-chain linkages away from China.\n\nEIU\u2019s dim view of Mr Biden\u2019s signature economic policy for Asia\u2014the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF)\u2014is based on the difficulties hamstringing his administration in forging a more ambitious agreement.

Tighter scrutiny over transshipments via third markets, particularly in the context of sanctions and tariff evasion in relation to US policy restrictions on Russia, China and other nations subject to US trade controls. Mr Biden\u2019s administration has already begun tightening sanctions enforcement in ways that highlight the extra-territorial application of US law, while also extending punitive actions to third countries seen as facilitating tariff avoidance. We see South-east Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe as among the most exposed regions in this regard.\n\nHowever, a Trump election victory would also carry specific threats for certain regions. Irregular migration from Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa to the US would likely be mixed into US trade policy discussions, even as the US concurrently encourages outbound corporate investment into the region\u2019s critical minerals sectors. US involvement in Africa\u2019s green transition, in particular, would likely be dialled back, replaced by efforts to develop opportunities in the continent\u2019s copper, cobalt, iron ore and rare-earth element industries.\n\nIn addition, we assign a high risk that Mr Trump would resurrect discussions on US automotive tariffs (\u201cSection 232 tariffs\u201d), which he had threatened to impose on foreign importers throughout his first term. We see European countries as among the most disproportionately exposed to these policies, given the nature of trans-Atlantic trade ties. However, vehicle exporters from South Korea and Japan would also be at risk\u2014despite their renegotiated trade frameworks with Mr Trump during his first term\u2014given Mr Trump\u2019s concerns about the US\u2019s bilateral trade deficits with these nations.\n\nThe analysis and forecasts featured in this article are available in EIU\u2019s Country Analysis service.

        "text": "U.S. spy agencies are ready to warn voters about foreign election interference \u2014 if it's severe enough\nU.S. intelligence agencies are closely tracking attempts by foreign adversaries to influence the 2024 election through \u201cdeepfakes\u201d or other false information and are ready to alert the public if necessary, officials said Wednesday.\n\nA decision to notify the public about attempted election interference by foreign actors would be up to the leaders of the country\u2019s intelligence agencies, including intelligence chief Avril Haines, officials from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, or ODNI, told reporters.\n\nThe decision to issue a public warning would follow a review by digital forensic experts and intelligence analysts, the ODNI officials said. It would be based on an assessment of whether the disinformation was serious enough that it \u201ccould affect the election outcome,\u201d an official said.\n\nIntelligence officials briefed reporters Wednesday amid growing concern from lawmakers that federal agencies are not sufficiently prepared to respond to a rising tide of disinformation fueled by new technology and deep divisions in American society.\n\nBut at a media briefing, ODNI officials said a new office created to monitor information operations by foreign enemies has gathered experts from across the country\u2019s intelligence agencies and is holding regular exercises to prepare for the election.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking a very proactive approach,\u201d an ODNI official said.\n\nHaines, the director of national intelligence, set up the Foreign Malign Influence Center in September 2022, more than two years after Congress ordered its creation following revelations of Russian election interference in the 2016 polls.\n\nRussia continues to pose the most serious risk for foreign interference in the U.S. election, as it hopes to undermine Western support for Ukraine and weaken American democracy, officials said.\n\n\u201cWe do consider Russia to be our primary threat for this election,\u201d an ODNI official said. China is taking a \u201cmore cautious\u201d approach, while Iran operates as a \u201cchaos agent,\u201d trying to disrupt the democratic process, the official said.\n\nU.S. authorities already have privately notified targets of malicious foreign disinformation, including local governments, companies and individuals. Intelligence officials declined to specify the number of those cases but said they have issued more of those \u201cnon-public\u201d notifications recently, partly because foreign adversaries are more focused on U.S. presidential elections.\n\nFederal officials have issued a public warning about foreign election disinformation once, in 2020, when Iran was accused of orchestrating emails to registered voters purportedly from the far-right extremist group the Proud Boys. The emails threatened the recipients with physical injury unless they switched parties and voted for President Donald Trump.\n\nTo insulate the office from partisan political bias, career civil servants in the intelligence community oversee the effort to track foreign information operations aimed at the election, officials said.\n\nIntelligence reporting shapes the monitoring of foreign influence operations, and intelligence analysts flag cases. If an instance of disinformation is not sufficiently \u201csevere\u201d or if it is orchestrated by a domestic actor, the case is dropped, officials said. The FBI or other domestic agencies would then decide whether to pursue the matter.\n\n\u201cWe are not going to look at domestic actors,\u201d the official said. \u201cIt\u2019s not within our writ.\u201d\n\nThe center tries to cultivate \u201cpartnerships\u201d with state and local agencies, but officials are aware that some local officials may lack trust in the federal government, the official added.\n\nSome experts and members of Congress have expressed concern that the polarized political climate in America could lead to an overly cautious approach by the intelligence agencies and the FBI to call out threats to the election from disinformation spread by foreign powers. Trump and his supporters have portrayed the Justice Department and the intelligence agencies as carrying out a secret political agenda to persecute him and thwart his agenda.\n\nBut intelligence analysts have flagged or \u201cnominated\u201d more cases of potential foreign influence operations in recent months, surpassing levels seen in the last four to five years, officials said.\n\n\u201cThere have been more nominations than we have ever seen,\u201d the official said, declining to provide more data or other details.\n\nAsked whether some foreign governments deemed to be U.S. partners or allies are also engaging in election influence operations, the ODNI official said: \u201cWe go where the intelligence takes us.\u201d\n\nIt takes about a week for a specific threat to be vetted as credible and reviewed by senior officials, the ODNI officials said. The process is being \u201cstreamlined,\u201d and if there were an urgent case near Election Day, it could take less than 24 hours, the officials said.\n\nODNI officials also said more foreign actors are spreading disinformation, including proxies and private companies hired out by governments. Intermediaries complicate efforts to trace the sources of false information, the officials said.",

        "text": "Who has the 'Keys to the White House'? Historian with ace record calling elections weighs in on Trump verdict\nFormer President Trump's criminal conviction in his historic New York trial may have thrown the 2024 presidential election into unprecedented upheaval \u2013 or it may not have, according to Dr. Allan Lichtman.\n\nThe American University historian, who has correctly predicted the outcome of nine of the last 10 U.S. presidential elections, told Fox News Digital that instant analysis of Trump's conviction is meaningless as the country looks forward to Election Day. \"We're not going to know much until the sentencing hearing on July 11, right before the Republican convention,\" Lichtman said in an interview.\n\nAllowing himself to speculate, the proven prognosticator said Trump's conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records does not appear to have fundamentally cracked his base, which Trump will need united to defeat President Biden in November. But no one knows, neither Lichtman nor the pundits he perennially outperforms, how Americans outside Trump's base will react to a convicted criminal on the presidential ballot.\n\n\"We don't know how this might affect moderate and swing independent voters. So really, we have got to look over time and not rely on instant, unreliable punditry,\" said Lichtman.\n\nTRUMP GETS WARM RECEPTION AND PILES OF CAMPAIGN CASH DURING SUNNY BLUE STATE SWING\n\nLichtman is a historian, not a psychic. The formula he's used to correctly predict nearly every presidential race since 1984, his \"Keys to the White House,\" was developed in 1981 with mathematician Vladimir Keilis-Borok and is based on their analysis of presidential elections dating back to 1860. The secret to his success, Lichtman says, is to keep his own personal preferences out of his predictions.\n\n\"We reconceptualize presidential elections not as Carter versus Reagan, Republican versus Democrat, liberal versus conservative, but in geophysical terms,\" he explained. \"Stability: The White House party keeps power. Earthquake: The White House party is turned out.\"\n\nThe \"keys\" consist of 13 true or false questions, parameters that, if true, favor stability. When eight or more of the keys are false, the incumbent White House party is the predicted loser. This formula helped Lichtman correctly predict that Trump would prevail in 2016, when the polls, debate performances and political commentators all favored Democrat Hillary Clinton. Previously, he said President Barack Obama would win re-election when Republican Mitt Romney was favored. And he correctly called the 2020 election for Biden.\n\n\"The keys are an alternative to the polls, which are not predictors. They're snapshots, they're abused, not used as predictors. And the pundits, you know, who are a lot of fun, but they're sports talk radio. They have no scientific basis for any of their predictions,\" Lichtman argued.\n\nTRUMP RILES UP FIERY SWING STATE CROWD IN FIRST RALLY SINCE NEW YORK CONVICTION\n\nThe 2024 election is still in flux, and so Lichtman has not made a final projection for this year. But a lot would have to go wrong for Biden to lose to Trump, he claims.\n\nLichtman's keys are as follows: party mandate, contest, incumbency, third party, short-term economy, long-term economy, policy change, social unrest, scandal, foreign/military failure, foreign/military success, incumbent charisma and challenger charisma.\n\nAs things stand, Biden has definitively lost two of Lichtman's keys. \"He's lost what I call the mandate key based on midterm elections, because the Democrats lost seats in 2022, they needed to win seats to win that key. And he loses the charisma key because he's no Franklin Roosevelt or John F. Kennedy,\" Lichtman said.\n\nIf six keys turn against Biden, he is likely to lose. The four keys to watch are whether Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., or another third-party candidate wins at least 10% support in national polls; social unrest linked to widespread anti-Israel protests on college campuses, and success or failure for Biden's foreign policy endeavors amid the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nPOLLING GURU FLOATS THE IDEA OF BIDEN DROPPING OUT: AT SOME POINT \u2018CONTINUING TO RUN IS A BIGGER RISK\u2019\n\nSeveral Democratic strategists and a number of pundits are losing confidence in Biden's campaign as polls show Trump ahead in several key swing states. Election data guru and FiveThirtyEight founder Nate Silver suggested Monday that the president's \"all-time low\" in approval ratings might be enough justification for him to drop out or for the party to nominate someone else at the Democratic convention in August.\n\nLichtman warns that replacing Biden would be a massive unforced error for Democrats.\n\n\"With Biden running, he wins my incumbency key: sitting president. He wins the party contest: uncontested. Essentially, that means he wins two keys off the top,\" Lichtman explained.\n\nWithout Biden on the ticket, the Democrats would automatically lose two more keys, meaning just four more would have to fall to predict their defeat.\n\nJAMES CARVILLE REGRETS THAT BIDEN IS RUNNING, WORRIES YOUNGER GENERATION UNINTERESTED IN POLITICS\n\n\"This nonsense about Biden stepping down points to the dangers of off-the-top-of-the-head punditry and commentary that is not based on any scientific understanding of how elections work,\" Lichtman said.\n\nDoom and gloom punditry is part of what Lichtman calls the \"political industrial complex\" \u2013 an iron triangle of pollsters and political consultants who profit from campaigns, news reporters eager to cover negative soundbites and politicians who are afraid to challenge the other two points of the triangle. The horse race theory of elections creates drama and makes money for those involved, Lichtman claims, but it's not very helpful to inform Americans about the direction of the country.\n\n\"The keys provide a way of breaking the iron triangle,\" said Lichtman. \"The candidates themselves have to run different kinds of campaigns,\" he added. \"Campaign by the keys, which is, you campaign on your vision. If you're an incumbent, what it is you have done and what you expect to do. If you're a challenger, what's your clear vision for America?\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNobody remembers conventional campaigns. The ones that make history, Lichtman argues, are the substantive campaigns that articulated a vision for the country \u2013 think Barry Goldwater in 1964, who lost in a landslide but defined conservative principles for generations to come. Or George McGovern, whose liberal principals have shaped the Democratic Party since he was defeated by Richard Nixon in 1972.\n\n\"Ronald Reagan in 1980 very forthrightly put forth his views on tax cuts, deregulation, building the military, challenging the Soviet Union. And he won, he won big,\" Lichtman said. \"And that philosophy again influenced politicians, in his case both liberal and conservative, through our time.\"\n\nFox News Digital's Aubrie Spady and Joe Schoffstall contributed to this report.",

        "text": "What the far-right victories in the European Union could say about US elections this year\nThe just-concluded European Union elections were yet another milestone for far-right parties on the continent. They racked up gains across many of the EU\u2019s 27 countries, and the surprising scale of their victories is rattling the political establishment there and drawing attention in the United States.\n\nThe parties\u2019 success embarrassed German Chancellor Olaf Scholz by outpacing his party and prompted French President Emmanuel Macron to call snap legislative elections.\n\nWhile votes were still being tallied Tuesday, the gain for the right is just the latest example of how discontent with globalization and immigration have fueled a conservative, populist backlash in affluent Western democracies. Former President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 win was the strongest example of this, but it\u2019s unclear whether the trends that powered the right in Europe will enable him to win another term in November.\n\nThat\u2019s because, along with the striking parallels, there are key differences between the dynamics in Europe and the U.S. And even with the right\u2019s gains in the most recent European elections there, the political center still is likely to retain control of the EU parliament.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re clearly at one of those points where the wind can blow in either direction,\u201d said Charlies A. Kupchan, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nWHAT FUELED THE RIGHT IN EUROPE?\n\nAll of the EU\u2019s countries have different political dynamics, and the EU parliamentary elections are often an opportunity for voters in each country to take a symbolic vote against those in power in their own nation, since they\u2019re voting for people who will take office in Brussels rather than their own capital. There\u2019s also been a global backlash to incumbents that doesn\u2019t seem to have any ideological basis.\n\nBut the right\u2019s resurgence in Europe is more than symbolic or random. It\u2019s been powered by frustration at the migrant crisis in the EU \u2014 frustration the right has been eager to amplify in online platforms \u2014 as well as regulations on climate change and other issues that have been seen as hitting rural, less-educated residents harder. Economic growth in much of Europe has been stagnant since the 2008 global recession, further powering discontent with the status quo.\n\nFar right or populist parties now lead Italy and Slovakia and are part of ruling coalitions in other countries such as Finland, Sweden and, shortly, the Netherlands.\n\nGenerally, the right\u2019s strongest support on the continent is among rural voters who have lower levels of education than urban ones who express greater comfort with the economic and social changes of globalization. All this probably sounds very familiar to U.S. voters, where there have been similar splits between Trump\u2019s Republicans and President Joe Biden\u2019s Democrats.\n\nIS TRUMP RIDING THE SAME WAVE?\n\nTrump has embraced the European right, especially Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, whose self-styled \u201cilliberal democracy\u201d has made him an icon for conservative populists who believe in limiting immigration and LGBTQ+ rights. He\u2019s endorsed multiple European conservative populists in their bids for national leadership, and some of Trump\u2019s key advisers maintain ties with the movement across the Atlantic.\n\nOne of those former advisers, Steve Bannon, on Monday called the EU elections \u201ca tectonic plate shift\u201d on his podcast.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like here in the United States, it\u2019s what MAGA does,\u201d Bannon said, using the acronym for Trump\u2019s Make America Great Again movement. \u201cMAGA pulls us farther to the right. And I think that\u2019s a, not just a good thing, it\u2019s necessary for the nation and necessary for the world.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s 2016 victory, despite losing the popular vote, was secured partly by pledging to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico to limit immigration. This year, he has slammed Biden on the surge of migrants crossing the southern border seeking asylum in the U.S. Acknowledging the potency of the issue, Biden has shifted right on immigration by issuing new regulations to close the border if crossings are too high.\n\nThere are some key differences, however, between Trump and European populists, the most significant being their records on democracy. Trump tried to overturn his loss to Biden in 2020, culminating in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. He has embraced that cause in his campaign to regain office, continuing to repeat the lie that he was cheated out of re-election by widespread fraud and calling those who stormed the Capitol \u201cwarriors\u201d during a Las Vegas rally on Sunday.\n\nSteven Levitsky, a Harvard political scientist and co-author of \u201cHow Democracies Die,\u201d said that\u2019s in sharp contrast with European populists.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re much less openly authoritarian than Trump,\u201d Levitsky said. \u201cNone of these guys have rejected election results.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s been a political vulnerability for Trump, who continues to make false claims that the 2020 election was stolen. Biden has assailed him relentlessly over Jan. 6 and has signaled that he\u2019ll make preserving democracy core to his campaign. Trump supporters who targeted state election offices lost in every swing state in 2022 and Democrats hope the same dynamic will protect Biden this year.\n\nKupchan said Trump\u2019s voters may be angrier and more desperate than their European counterparts because of that continent\u2019s robust social safety net.\n\n\u201cOne reason the center has held in Europe and not in the U.S. is Americans have farther to fall,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a worker in Europe and you\u2019ve lost your job on a VW production line, you\u2019re hurting but you\u2019re not in as much trouble as someone in Michigan.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s strongest support has been among older voters, in contrast to European populists who experts say do better among younger voters. And in the American two-party system, the current election amounts to a game of chicken with voters, who will need to choose either Biden or Trump. The race may come down to who is the least distasteful to voters and whether third party candidates unable to gain any political power in the race will pull away enough votes to doom one of the two major party candidates.\n\nIt\u2019s far from inevitable that Trump will win. Just look to Europe to see that conservative populism has its limits.\n\nTHE RIGHT CAN ONLY GO SO FAR\n\nThere have been limits to the right\u2019s gains in Europe. Last year, Poland\u2019s conservative populist government lost power as voters opted for a center-left coalition. The United Kingdom left the EU in a win for conservative populism, but its conservative Tory party is expected to lose big in upcoming elections, even if the opposition Labour party isn\u2019t planning on reversing Brexit.\n\nEven in the heart of conservative populism\u2019s power in Europe, Hungary, there\u2019s been mounting discontent with the incumbent government.\n\nIn places where the right has taken power, like Italy, where Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni\u2019s party doubled the number of its members in the EU parliament, it has not been a radical break. Meloni has kept her country as part of the coalition supporting Ukraine\u2019s fight against Russia. While she\u2019s cracked down on admitting migrants who traverse the Mediterranean into the country, she and her neo-fascist-rooted Brothers of Italy party have not made any fundamental changes to the country\u2019s political and economic structure.\n\nMatthias Matthisj, a professor of international political economy at Johns Hopkins University, said Italy might be an example of how populists will govern in Europe.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to be stricter on Muslim prayer and you can drive faster on the highway now,\u201d Matthisj said. \u201cBut on the big stuff \u2014 the budget, foreign policy \u2014 the only way these populists can come to power is if they stay in the center.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s in contrast to Trump, who has embraced striking shifts in U.S. policy and how the federal government might operate if he wins. Some analysts believe a Trump victory could give permission to European populists like Meloni to shift further right.\n\nEven after the EU elections, radical change is unlikely. The Christian Democrats of EU President Ursula von der Leyen shifted rightward to counter the populist surge, and remain by far the largest party in the 720-member body. The center still holds in Europe \u2014 it just moved right. Whether that happens in the U.S. in November is the next question.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press write Ali Swenson in New York contributed to this report.",

        "text": "What is Project 2025? Wish list for a Trump presidency, explained\nProject 2025 is a product of the Heritage Foundation, one of Washington's most prominent right-wing think tanks. It first produced policy plans for future Republican administrations in 1981, when Ronald Reagan was about to take office.\n\nIt has produced similar documents in connection with subsequent presidential elections, including in 2016, when Trump first won the presidency.\n\nThat's not unusual - it's common for US think tanks of all political stripes to propose policy wish lists for future governments.\n\nAnd Heritage has been successful in influencing Republican administrations. A year into Trump's first term, it boasted that the White House had adopted nearly two-thirds of its proposals.\n\nThe Project 2025 report was unveiled in April 2023, but it went largely unnoticed outside of policy circles until earlier this year, when Democratic opposition to the document ramped up.\n\nDemocratic politicians launched a \"Stop Project 2025 Task Force\" and even set up a tip line to collect insider information on Heritage's activities, claiming there is a \"secret\" part of the agenda pushing a list of executive orders that Trump could implement.\n\nThe Harris campaign and its surrogates consistently brought up the project in interviews and speeches.\n\nTrump began pushing away from the document in early July.\n\n\"I know nothing about Project 2025,\" he posted on his social media platform, Truth Social. \"I have no idea who is behind it.\n\n\"I disagree with some of the things they're saying and some of the things they\u2019re saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal.\"\n\nBut the team that created the project was chock-full of former Trump advisers, including director Paul Dans, who was chief of staff at the Office of Personnel Management while Trump was president. Dans later left the project.\n\nRussell Vought, another former Trump administration official, wrote a key chapter in the document and also served as the Republican National Committee\u2019s 2024 platform policy director.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation's president, Kevin Roberts, oversaw Project 2025 and is close to the vice-president elect, JD Vance, who wrote a forward for his new book Dawn\u2019s Early Light. The book's publication was originally scheduled for September but was delayed until after the election.\n\nAdditionally, more than 100 conservative organisations contributed to the document, Heritage says, including many that will now be hugely influential in Washington.\n\nThe document itself, external sets out four main policy aims: restore the family as the centrepiece of American life; dismantle the administrative state; defend the nation's sovereignty and borders; and secure God-given individual rights to live freely.",

        "text": "What would Trump's and Biden's second-term policy on Ukraine look like?\nForeign policy experts differ over what direction U.S. Ukraine policy will take if Donald Trump returns to the White House, with predictions ranging from more robust U.S. support to heavy pressure on Kyiv to concede all the land it has already lost.\n\nShould Biden win re-election, most say, Ukraine policy will likely remain largely unchanged, with the possibility of even stronger sanctions on Russia.\n\nVague statements and personal feelings\n\nTrump\u2019s position on Ukraine and Russia\u2019s war against it has been vague, contradictory and, perhaps, evolving.\n\nOn February 22, 2022, just two days before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Trump called Russian President Vladimir Putin's moves against Ukraine \"savvy\" and \"genius.\"\n\nThe following year, during a May 2023 CNN town hall, Trump refused to say which side he wanted to win in Ukraine or to commit to providing Ukraine further military support.\n\n\"We're giving away so much equipment, we don't have ammunition for ourselves right now,\" he said.\n\nTrump told Fox News in July 2023 that he would tell Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, \"No more. You have to make a deal,\u201d while also telling Putin: \u201cIf you don't make a deal, we will give them a lot. We will give them more than they ever got, if we have to.\u201d\n\nIn April this year, Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform: \u201cWhy isn\u2019t Europe giving more money to help Ukraine? \u2026 Why can\u2019t Europe equalize or match the money put in by the United States of America in order to help a Country in desperate need? As everyone agrees, Ukrainian Survival and Strength should be much more important to Europe than to us, but it is also important to us! GET MOVING EUROPE!\u201d\n\nAlso in April, The Washington Post detailed what it called Trump\u2019s \u201csecret, long-shot plan to end the war in Ukraine,\u201d reporting that it included pushing Ukraine to cede Crimea and the Donbas region to Russia.\n\nIn May, however, the newspaper reported that Trump, during a fundraising event, had \u201csuggested that he would have bombed Moscow and Beijing if Russia invaded Ukraine or China invaded Taiwan.\u201d\n\nStill, experts who talked to VOA noted that Trump has unpleasant personal associations with Ukraine.\n\nHis July 2019 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy led to Trump\u2019s first impeachment over allegations that he improperly sought help from a foreign power to boost his reelection chances. In February 2020, a majority of the Republican-led Senate acquitted him.\n\nOn the other hand, some experts believe that Trump wouldn't want to be seen as a president who lost a war.\n\n\"We do know that Trump perceives himself as a strong man and does not want to be associated with foreign policy failure,\u201d said John Herbst, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who is now a senior director of the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center. \u201cAnd a Russian victory in Ukraine if Trump is president would look very much like a foreign policy failure.\u201d\n\nTwo wings of the Republican Party\n\nThe Republican Party is divided over Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine war and support for the embattled country.\n\nA pro-Trump faction \u2014 informally dubbed the MAGA (Make America Great Again) wing \u2014 views Russia as a \u201cdeclining power\u201d and thus believes the war \u201cneeds to be settled as quickly as possible so that it does not drain the security resources of the United States,\" Sergiy Kudelia, an associate professor of political science at Texas\u2019s Baylor University, told VOA.\n\nThe other Republican faction seeks more robust support for Ukraine to defeat Russia.\n\nIf that second wing prevails, said Kudelia, a second Trump administration might provide even more support to Ukraine than the Biden administration.\n\nPossible clues of how a new Trump administration would approach Russia-Ukraine policy can be found in plans put forward by two pro-Trump policy projects. One of them is Project 2025, also known as the Presidential Transition Project, produced by the Washington-based Heritage Foundation.\n\nIn its \u201cMandate for Leadership,\u201d Project 2025 favors an approach between \u201cisolationism and interventionism\u201d:\n\n\u201cRather, each foreign policy decision must first ask the question: What is in the interest of the American people? U.S. military engagement must clearly fall within U.S. interests; be fiscally responsible; and protect American freedom, liberty, and sovereignty, all while recognizing Communist China as the greatest threat to U.S. interests. Thus, with respect to Ukraine, continued U.S. involvement must be fully paid for; limited to military aid (while European allies address Ukraine\u2019s economic needs); and have a clearly defined national security strategy that does not risk American lives.\u201d\n\nThe other plan, put forward by the America First Policy Institute, would make future U.S. military aid to Ukraine contingent on its leaders engaging in peace talks with Russia:\n\n\u201cSpecifically, it would mean a formal U.S. policy to seek a cease-fire and negotiated settlement of the Ukraine conflict. The United States would continue to arm Ukraine and strengthen its defenses to ensure Russia will make no further advances and will not attack again after a cease-fire or peace agreement. Future American military aid, however, will require Ukraine to participate in peace talks with Russia.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Michael Kimmage, a professor of history and department chair at the Catholic University of America in Washington, told VOA that it is difficult to predict how a re-elected Trump would conduct policy toward Russia and Ukraine:\n\n\"He's just a person who changes his mind often and responds often quite emotionally to events, sometimes in his personal life, sometimes in domestic politics, sometimes in international affairs. So I think it's fair to say that the Trump presidency would be a roller coaster.\"\n\nWhat about a second Biden term?\n\nSince Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, the U.S. Congress has provided $175 billion in aid to Ukraine at the Biden administration's request. Washington has imposed numerous sanctions on Russia and led the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, a coalition of about 50 countries coordinating military assistance.\n\nIn his address on June 6, the 80th anniversary of the Allied storming of Normandy, Biden compared the fight against Putin to the fight against Hitler in WWII.\n\nBiden said last December while urging Congress to approve funding to support Ukraine that failure to do so would embolden other would-be aggressors and encourage Putin to attack a NATO country, which the U.S. is committed to defending:\n\n\"Then we'll have something that we don't seek and that we don't have today: American troops fighting Russian troops.\"\n\nRecently, the Biden administration partially removed restrictions on Ukraine using U.S.-provided weapons against military targets in Russia.\n\nKimmage said that in a second term, the Biden administration would likely maintain its currently policy of providing military aid to Ukraine. However, he said that given it would have fewer political considerations in its final term, the Biden administration might be more aggressive in imposing sanctions against Russia:\n\n\"It's not as if they're determining their foreign policy on the basis of the election in some crude fashion, but there are limits and constraints, and those would be very different in a second term where Biden can no longer run for reelection in 2028. So, he would be quite a bit freer.\"",

This question is looming large over the party and the political system of the country as he has slipped to the all-time low rating of 37.4%. Pollster Nate Silver has said that \"Biden just hit a new all-time low in approval.\" He took to the social media platform X to write that dropping out would be a big risk, but there\u2019s some threshold below which continuing to run is a bigger risk.Earlier too the data analyst and founder of FiveThirtyEight has questioned Biden's ability to beat Republican contender Donald Trump in the presidential election. According to 'New York Post', Silver said in February that there are some other Democrat leaders who would be in a better position to take on Trump. He also said that it would have been better for the Democrats had Joe Biden decided a year earlier not to seek the second term. He further added that it would have allowed Democrats to elect a better leader.Net Silver said that Joe Biden was much better in 2020 when he took the lead in the swing states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, Florida and North Carolina. Recent surveys have shown that Donald Trump is way ahead of Biden at present in those states.Earlier in May, the Bloomberg News/Morning Consult survey released data showing the 45th president ahead of the incumbent by seven percentage points in North Carolina (49%-42%) and five percentage points in Arizona (49%-44%). It also showed that the GOP contender also has the edge inGeorgia, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin (47%-46%), but the spread in all three states is within the poll\u2019s margin of error.The same outlet in a survey conducted in April found that Donald Trump was leading Joe Biden by 10 points in North Carolina, eight points in Nevada, seven points in Arizona, six points in Georgia and four points in Wisconsin. While Biden won six of the seven swing states from Trump in 2020, with only North Carolina backing the Republican.Joe Biden took the lead in swing states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, Florida and North Carolina in the 2020 presidential election.The Bloomberg News/Morning Consult conducted in April found that Donald Trump was leading Joe Biden by 10 points in North Carolina, eight points in Nevada, seven points in Arizona, six points in Georgia and four points in Wisconsin.",

Hunter Biden became the first child of a serving United States President to be convicted of a crime after a 12-member jury in Wilmington, Delaware, on Tuesday found him guilty on all three counts. Hunter Biden became the first child of a serving United States President to be convicted of a crime after a 12-member jury in Wilmington, Delaware, on Tuesday found him guilty on all three counts.\n\nHunter, 54, nodded briefly after the decision was given. He then patted his attorney, Abbe Lowell, on the back before hugging another member of his legal team.\n\nHowever, the judge did not set a date for sentence, but stated that it is generally within 120 days. It seems that the sentencing would take place before the November 5 US presidential election.\n\nGuidelines for imprisonment for firearms crimes range from 15 to 21 months, although legal experts say prisoners in similar instances frequently receive shorter sentences and are less likely to be detained if they follow the terms of their preliminary release.\n\nOn May 30, Trump was convicted on 34 misdemeanor counts of fabricating company documents to cover up hush money payment to former film star Stormy Daniels. He alleged that Democrats pursued the case against him in order to stop him from reclaiming power in his potential rematch with Joe Biden.\n\nCongressional Democrats have backed Joe Biden, citing the Hunter Biden prosecution as proof that the incumbent President does not use the legal system to advance political or personal gain, while declaring that he would not pardon his son if convicted.\n\nAlso Read: Big blow for Joe Biden as son Hunter convicted in gun trial; Will he go to prison after his guilty verdict?\n\nHunter Biden's unending legal troubles\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden was filed by US Department of Justice Special Counsel David Weiss, who was appointed by Trump. He also charged Hunter with three felony and six minor tax charges in California, claiming that he neglected to pay $1.4 million in taxes from 2016 to 2019, despite spending millions on drugs, escorts, luxury cars among others\n\nBiden's son has pleaded not guilty to all the accusations and the trial is slated for September 5 in Los Angeles.\n\nHunter's attorneys attempted to demonstrate that he was not consuming drugs when he purchased the pistol and didn't mean to falsify since he never considered himself an illicit drug user when filling out the form.\n\nHere's how netizens are reacting to Hunter Biden's conviction\n\nReacting to his conviction, one X user wrote: \u201cHistoric moment in U.S Politics. Let\u2019s see if Joe keeps his promise not to pardon.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a great news that means more reasons to vote Biden out,\u201d another reacted.\n\n\u201cSo how long till Biden Pardons him?\u201d a third user wrote, while the fourth wondered, \u201cWas pretty much on the cards. Will this have an impact on Joe?\u201d\n\n\u201cHunter Biden Guilty. This is NOTHING compared to the REAL CRIMES Hunter committed. International money laundering, selling access to the White House, child sex trafficking, drugs, on and on,\u201d Bill Mitchell wrote.",

        "text": "Historian with near-perfect record predicting elections dishes on \u2018unprecedented situation\u2019 in 2024\nA historian who has correctly predicted 9 out of the last 10 presidential elections is keeping his powder dry on the 2024 race for now as he tries to gauge the fallout of former President Donald Trump\u2019s conviction.\n\nDr. Allan Lichtman, a distinguished professor at American University, surmised that it\u2019s simply too early to understand the ramifications of Trump\u2019s conviction, but believes his algorithm will stand.\n\n\u201cWe have no idea yet what the impact of this is going to be,\u201d Lichtman told Fox News Digital. \u201cI\u2019ll just speculate, for what it\u2019s worth \u2014 it\u2019s not going to fundamentally crack Trump\u2019s base,\u201d\n\n5 Dr. Allan Lichtman claims to have predicted 9 out of the last 10 presidential elections with his algorithm. Facebook / Allan Lichtman\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know how this might affect moderate, swing, [and] independent voters.\u201d\n\nTrump, 77, became the first president to be found guilty of criminal offenses last month when a New York jury voted to convict on all 34 counts against him for falsifying business records to conceal hush money payments.\n\nLichtman maintains that the unprecedented conviction does not affect his feted prediction algorithm.\n\n\u201cWe do have an unprecedented situation right now. We\u2019ve never before had a former president, or, for that matter, a major party presidential candidate, even charged with a crime, much less convicted of 34 felonies. Now that does not directly affect the [algorithm],\u201d he told the outlet.\n\nAlthough Lichtman has refrained from making a prediction in the 2024 election cycle, he does indicate Biden is the favorite for now.\n\nHe has called every election since the Reagan era except 2000 when George Bush defeated Al Gore. His correct predictions include Trump\u2019s 2016 upset and President Biden\u2019s victory over him four years later.\n\n5 The Post cover story on the Manhattan jury\u2019s vote finding Donald Trump guilty of all 34 counts. csuarez\n\nTo prognosticate these presidential battles, Lichtman relies on his so-called \u201cKeys to the White House,\u201d \u2014 13 parameters to appraise each candidate\u2019s standing. He developed the algorithm in the 1980s with mathematician Vladimir Keilis-Borok by studying presidential contests going back to the 1860s.\n\nBut this cycle is shaping up to be unique given Trump\u2019s unprecedented status and how it\u2019s set to be the first presidential rematch since 1956.\n\nMoreover, third-party contenders appear poised to take the largest bite out of the duopoly since the early 1990s.\n\nKeep up with today's most important news Stay up on the very latest with Evening Update.

Check out more newsletters\n\n\u201cThings are very fluid abroad and in America and a lot can change. What I have said is a lot would have to go wrong for Biden to lose this election. It could happen, but right now a lot would have to go wrong,\u201d he said.\n\nBiden is currently down in most battleground state poll aggregates and also trails Trump in a five-way race nationally, 39.7% to 42.6%, per the latest RealClearPolitics aggregate.\n\n5 So far a bevy of polls have not shown much dramatic movement in Donald Trump\u2019s political standing following his conviction. Robert Miller\n\nLichtman\u2019s 13 \u201ckeys\u201d include incumbency, party mandate, contest, third party, long-term economy, short-term economy, policy change, social unrest, scandal, incumbent charisma, challenger charisma, and foreign/military success.\n\nSo far, he believes Biden isn\u2019t getting the charisma or mandate keys, but posited the 81-year-old clinched the incumbency and party mandate keys.\n\n\u201cThis nonsense about Biden stepping down points to the dangers of off-the-top-of-the-head punditry and commentary that is not based on any scientific understanding of how elections work,\u201d Lichtman contended.\n\n5 Donald Trump has conveyed confidence that he win his rematch with President Biden. AP\n\n5 President Biden has cast his rival as a threat to democracy. AP\n\nAnother significant factor looming large is foreign policy strife over the Israel-Hamas war which has reverberated back home, splintering the progressive base.\n\nBiden has faced hundreds of thousands of protest votes in the Democratic primary from individuals who have marked themselves as some variation of \u201cuncommitted\u201d in anger over his support of Israel.\n\nHis administration has scrambled to help broker a cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas, so it is unclear where the war will stand in the weeks leading up to the election.\n\nTrump and Biden are set to square off later this month in Atlanta on June 27 for their first debate of the season hosted by CNN.",

        "text": "Lesson Plan: Political Parties: Two is Company, Three\u2019s a Crowd\nUPDATE: Originally published in 2016, and updated in 2024.\n\nSubjects\n\nU.S. history, U.S. government, civics\n\nEstimated time\n\nOne to two 50-minute class periods\n\nGrade level\n\n7-12\n\nEssential question\n\nHow have third parties changed the outcomes of U.S. presidential elections?\n\nObjective\n\nTo examine the two-party political system in the United States and the effect upon it that third parties have had.\n\nOverview\n\nThe Founders did not intend to create a two-party system. As John Adams wrote, \u201c There is nothing which I dread so much as a division of the republic into two great parties, each arranged under its leader, and concerting measures in opposition to each other. This, in my humble apprehension, is to be dreaded as the greatest political evil under our Constitution.\u201d\n\nHowever, as the country grew in the 1800s and the Electoral College, as outlined in the Constitution, evolved into a \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d system in which three or more strong parties would make it impossible to get to the required 270 electoral votes to win a presidential election, a two-party system emerged.\n\nIn this lesson, students watch the We The Voters film \u201cAmerican Party Animals\u201d to better understand the two-party system, and then break into groups to study three U.S. elections with major third party candidates: the 1912, 1992, and 2000 elections. They conclude by applying their findings to Gary Johnson\u2019s Libertarian Party candidacy in 2016.\n\nMaterials\n\nProcedure\n\nIntroduce students to the popular saying, \u201cTwo is company, three\u2019s a crowd.\u201d Not only is this a popular saying, but it is also applicable to presidential elections when examining political parties.\n\nWarm up\n\nBegin by asking students: What third parties can they think of? Why did they not win?\n\nFilm Viewing: Play the We The Voters film, \u201cAmerican Party Animals.\u201d Ask: Does our Electoral College, as outlined in the Constitution, lend itself to three or more viable parties in its current structure?\n\nWe The Voters - American Party Animals on Vimeo.\n\nExamining Third Party Obstacles: Have students read the PBS NewsHour article Third Parties in the U.S. Political Process \" and complete Handout #1: Third Party Obstacles. Review as a class.\n\nMain activity\n\nElection Investigation: Next, divide the students into three groups. Have each group investigate one of the above-mentioned elections and complete Handout #2: Election Investigation for their election, drawing on the resources listed above and on the handout. Then, have the groups present their findings and have the other students complete the handout for the other elections.\n\nGary Johnson ran as a third party in 2016, and was the only third party candidate to appear on the ballot in all 50 states. Have the students take a brief look at Gary Johnson\u2019s position on four issues to complete the second part of Handout #2. Have students discuss Johnson\u2019s candidacy and possible effects on the 2016 election using their newfound knowledge, and citing evidence.\n\nExtension activities\n\nHave students go to the New York Times Room for Debate. Assign them an opinion article on third party candidates or select a few to jigsaw. Have the students take notes on their readings. Watch PBS NewsHour interviews with third-party candidates Gary Johnson and Jill Stein and discuss the following questions as a class or in pairs: What issues are they concentrating on? Are these different issues than the ones you hear Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump discuss?\n\nWhat are some reasons voters may want to vote for Johnson or Stein?\n\nShould the candidates be allowed to participate in at least one of the three presidential debates?\n\nCome back together as a whole class and conduct a Socratic Seminar on \u201cTwo is Company, Three\u2019s a Crowd\u201d using their notes from the article(s), interviews, and the handouts, citing evidence as they make their claims and counterclaims.\n\nSign up to receive NewsHour Classroom's ready-to-go Daily News Lessons each morning here.",

        "text": "Record Share of U.S. Electorate Is Pro-Choice and Voting on It\nWASHINGTON, D.C. -- A record-high 32% of U.S. voters say they would only vote for a candidate for major office who shares their views on abortion. The importance of a candidate\u2019s abortion stance to one\u2019s vote is markedly higher among pro-choice voters than it was during the 2020 presidential election cycle, while pro-life voters\u2019 intensity about voting on the abortion issue has waned. Also, voters\u2019 greater intensity on the issue today compared with 2020 is explained mainly by Democrats, while Republicans and independents have shown little change.\n\nU.S. adults who are pro-choice are also significantly more likely now than two decades ago to say it is important that any future Supreme Court nominees share their views on abortion.\n\nThese results come two years after the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization leaked draft decision foretold the court\u2019s plan to abolish constitutional protection for abortion.\n\nAt the same time, Gallup finds Americans\u2019 support for abortion rights and identification as \u201cpro-choice\u201d holding at the historically high levels seen since the Dobbs decision was leaked.\n\nThese findings are from Gallup\u2019s annual Values and Beliefs poll, conducted May 1-23.\n\nAbortion\u2019s Importance as Voting Issue Up, Especially Among Pro-Choice Voters\n\nGallup has gauged the importance of a candidate\u2019s views on abortion among U.S. registered voters at least once during each presidential election cycle since 1992. The current 32% who say they will only vote for a candidate who shares their views is up four percentage points since last May and eight points since 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, a diminished plurality of voters, 45% (down 11 points from last year), consider abortion to be just one of many important factors, the lowest reading since 2012. Another 19% (up five points) say it is not a major issue for them, which is the third consecutive reading under 20% and well below those taken between 1992 and 2020.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nAn examination of voters\u2019 responses to this question based on their stance on abortion shows that pro-choice candidates stand to benefit more than pro-life candidates from single-issue abortion voters. Specifically, nearly twice as many pro-choice voters (40%) as pro-life voters (22%) say they will only vote for a candidate who agrees with them on abortion. This is the third consecutive year that abortion-centric pro-choice voters have outnumbered abortion-centric pro-life voters in the U.S., marking a reversal of the pro-life advantage between 1996 and 2020.\n\nAs a result of these changes, the 32% of all registered voters who say they will only vote for candidates who share their views on abortion now includes 23% who are pro-choice and 8% who are pro-life. (Another 1% don\u2019t identify with either label.)\n\nBefore 2022, electoral energy was more balanced or leaned toward the pro-life side. During this time, no more than 10% of voters said they were pro-choice and would only vote for those with the same beliefs and no more than 13% of voters identified as pro-life and would only support candidates with the same position.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nThe increase in pro-choice Americans who say they prioritize the issue when voting may have helped Democrats blunt Republicans\u2019 anticipated gains in the 2022 midterm election and would appear to be an even greater advantage for the party today. One cautionary note is that all of the increase since then in voters saying they will only support candidates who share their position on abortion has occurred among Democrats. A slight majority of Democratic registered voters (52%) now say this, up from 37% in 2022.\n\nIn an era of hyper-partisanship and where candidates generally align with their party\u2019s position on the abortion issue, this isn\u2019t likely to affect whom Democrats vote for, but it could help drive Democrats to the polls. Meanwhile, independents\u2019 and Republicans\u2019 focus on the issue has been steady at just over 20%.\n\nMore Say Future Supreme Court Nominees\u2019 Abortion Stance Is Important\n\nOne way abortion is likely to be discussed in the presidential campaign is how the candidates\u2019 potential choices of Supreme Court nominees might influence U.S. law on the issue. (Donald Trump\u2019s appointment of three justices in his term, all of whom voted to overturn Roe v. Wade, made clear how presidential elections can affect abortion policy.) A slim majority of 51% of Americans say it is \u201cvery important\u201d that future nominees share their views on abortion, and another 31% say it is \u201csomewhat important.\u201d Just 9% believe nominees\u2019 abortion stance is \u201cnot too important\" and 8% \u201cnot important at all.\u201d\n\nThe only other reading on this question was taken in 2005. At that point, slightly fewer U.S. adults, 45%, viewed it as very important that the abortion views of nominees to the nation\u2019s highest court were consistent with their own.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nAgain, those who identify as pro-choice are more likely than their pro-life counterparts to feel most strongly. A 58% majority of pro-choice Americans consider it very important that nominees\u2019 abortion stance be the same as their own, compared with 45% of pro-life U.S. adults who say the same. In 2005, when abortion was legal nationwide, the opposite was true, with 53% of pro-life and 37% of pro-choice Americans saying it was very important.\n\nMajority of Americans Identifying as Pro-Choice Has Become the New Normal\n\nAt the same time that pro-choice voters are showing record intensity on the abortion issue, the pro-choice segment of the American public remains historically large.\n\nCurrently, 54% of U.S. adults identify as pro-choice on the issue, continuing the pattern of majority-level support for the position seen since the Dobbs decision was leaked, including 55% in the initial post-Dobbs reading in May 2022. That was the highest pro-choice share Gallup had measured since 1995 and the first time since 2006 that more than half of Americans were in the pro-choice camp on this measure. It has not fallen below that threshold since.\n\nMeanwhile, 41% of Americans now identify as pro-life, similar to the 39% to 44% levels recorded since the Dobbs leak but in contrast with the average 46% in the decade and half before it.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nAmericans Favor Legal Abortion, Say It Is Morally Acceptable\n\nAmericans have also become more likely to think abortion should be broadly legal and more tolerant of the morality of abortion in recent years.\n\nOn the legality questions, the public has been trending in favor of abortion rights since 2021, when the percentage saying it should be legal under any circumstances registered above 30% for the first time in nearly three decades. It has since ticked up further to today\u2019s 35%, exceeding the 1992 record high by one point. Offsetting this, the percentage saying abortion should be illegal in all cases has declined by seven points, from 19% in 2021 to 12%, tying the record lows from 1990 and 1995. Meanwhile, most respondents, now 50%, have consistently said abortion should be legal \u201conly under certain circumstances.\u201d\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nSince 1994, Gallup has asked Americans who hold the middle position on abortion to say whether they think it should be legal in most or only a few circumstances. In all years through 2021, their answers leaned strongly toward the \u201conly a few\u201d side, resulting in a majority of Americans favoring more restrictive laws on abortion, either saying it should be legal in only a few circumstances or illegal in all.\n\nIn the wake of the Dobbs draft leak in 2022, however, combined support for the more restrictive positions fell to 45%, while the percentage saying abortion should be legal in all or most circumstances rose to 53%. Although the two broad sides were tied last year, the positions in favor of expansive abortion rights are again the majority, at 51% today, while 45% prefer more restrictive rights.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nGallup\u2019s full trends on Americans\u2019 views about the legality of abortion and whether they identify as pro-choice or pro-life are shown by gender, age and partisanship on the following pages:\n\nSimilar to the legality trend, Americans\u2019 views on the morality of abortion have flipped from more viewing it as morally wrong than morally acceptable in most years since 2001, with only a few instances when these positions were tied. By contrast, since 2022, a majority of U.S. adults have said abortion is morally acceptable, with 54% holding that view today.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nTables showing various demographic groups\u2019 latest views on the abortion label, legality and morality questions are provided on the following pages:\n\nChanged U.S. Abortion Views Post Dobbs Driven by Democrats\n\nAcross all three trends, the shift toward more public support for abortion rights has occurred exclusively among Democrats, while the views of Republicans and independents are statistically unchanged.\n\nSince 2021, Gallup\u2019s last measure on these metrics before the Dobbs draft was leaked, the percentage of Democrats identifying as pro-choice has increased 16 points, from 70% to 86%, while just under a quarter of Republicans and a slight majority of independents have been pro-choice.\n\nDemocrats have also become 15 points more likely to think abortion should be legal under any circumstances, rising to 65%. Meanwhile, 12% of Republicans and 30% of independents, similar to the 2021 figures, hold this view.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 views have changed the most on the morality question, with the percentage considering abortion morally acceptable rising 19 points to 83%. This contrasts with a steady quarter of Republicans and about half of independents feeling this way.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nSix in 10 Americans Back Legality of Abortion Pill\n\nThe poll also measured public support for allowing an abortion pill, known as mifepristone, to be available in the country as a prescription drug. Sixty-one percent of adults approve, similar to the 63% measured last year. This is more support than the drug received in 2000, when 50% of Americans favored the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s initial approval of the pill -- then known as RU-486 -- as a prescription drug.\n\nAlthough mifepristone received federal approval in 2000, it wasn\u2019t until 2021 that the FDA lifted a requirement that the drug be dispensed to patients in person, opening the way for mail-order prescriptions. However, that access -- particularly important to women in states that have since outlawed abortion -- is now threatened by a 2023 federal circuit court decision limiting when and how the drug can be prescribed. The Supreme Court is expected to rule on that decision this month.\n\nHaving mifepristone available as a prescription drug is favored by 64% of women and 58% of men. While only a third of Republicans (32%) are in favor, it is backed by a majority of independents (61%) and most Democrats (87%).\n\nImplications\n\nThe electoral repercussions of being an avowed \u201cpro-choice\u201d or \u201cpro-life\u201d candidate for higher office have changed since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. Before the decision, pro-life candidates had a marginal advantage in voters prioritizing the issue in their vote choices. Since the decision, pro-choice candidates have jumped way ahead on this metric.\n\nSince the movement on this has mainly occurred within the Democratic Party, there is limited potential for heightened pro-choice energy to attract new voters to its candidates, including President Joe Biden. However, Democrats stand to benefit in November if it compels more pro-choice than pro-life voters to go to the polls.\n\nTo stay up to date with the latest Gallup News insights and updates, follow us on X @Gallup.\n\nLearn more about how the Gallup Poll Social Series works.\n\nView complete question responses and trends (PDF download).\n\n###Embeddable###",

        "text": "Presidential election a prime target for foreign disinformation, intelligence officials say\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 U.S. officials who track disinformation campaigns say they have issued more warnings to political candidates, government leaders and others targeted by foreign groups in recent months as America\u2019s adversaries seek to influence the outcome of the 2024 election.\n\nWithout giving specifics, an official from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said Wednesday that the number is higher, at least in part, because \u201cpresidential elections draw more attention from our adversaries.\u201d\n\nThe increase in notifications to targeted individuals, which began last fall, could also reflect a growing threat or the government\u2019s improved detection capabilities, or both, said the official, who was one of several to brief reporters on condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the office of the director.\n\nLawmakers from both parties have voiced worries about the nation\u2019s preparedness for foreign disinformation during the presidential election and the corrosive impact it has on voter confidence and trust in democratic institutions. They also have questioned whether the federal government is up to the task of issuing timely and effective warnings to voters when nations like Russia and China use disinformation to try to shape American politics.\n\nInfluence operations can include false or exaggerated claims and propaganda designed to mislead voters about specific candidates, issues or races. It can also include social media posts or other digital content that seeks to suppress the vote through intimidation or by giving voters false information about election procedures.\n\nOfficials say the list of nations launching such campaigns includes familiar foes like Russia, China and Iran as well as a growing number of second-tier players like Cuba. They also noted indications that some nations allied with the U.S. could mount their own efforts to influence voters.\n\nRussia was the top threat, one of the officials said, noting that its main objectives are degrading public support for Ukraine and eroding confidence in American democracy in general.\n\nChina is considered to be more cautious about its online disinformation campaigns and more concerned than Russia about potential blowback from the U.S., officials said. Iran is seen as a \u201cchaos agent\u201d that is more likely to experiment with online techniques to stoke voter anger and even violence.\n\nOfficials would not specify how many private warnings they have issued to candidates, political organizations or local election offices. Such warnings are delivered after an interagency panel of intelligence officials concludes that an influence operation could impact the outcome of an election or prevent certain groups from voting.\n\nThe notifications are only given when officials can attribute the operation to foreign sources, allowing the person or group that was targeted to \u201ctake a more defensive stance,\u201d an official said.\n\nThe office within the intelligence community that leads the work, the Foreign Malign Influence Center, has no jurisdiction over domestic groups. The officials who briefed reporters Wednesday said they work to avoid any appearance of policing Americans\u2019 speech or playing favorites when it comes to candidates.\n\nPoll workers in help people vote in the Nevada primary at a polling place, Tuesday, June 11, 2024, in Henderson, Nev.

        "text": "Trump on LGBTQ Rights: Rolling Back Protections and Criminalizing Gender Nonconformity\nThe ACLU is prepared to defend the LGBTQ community, including transgender individuals, from a second Trump administration\u2019s anticipated attempts to weaponize federal law against them. Learn more in our breakdown:\n\nWhile President Joe Biden\u2019s administration reversed much of the Trump-era abuses, just last month on the campaign trail, Trump vowed to dismantle a new Biden administration policy that will offer protections for transgender students under Title IX, a federal civil rights law that prohibits sex discrimination in education.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s administration initiated a sustained, years-long effort to erase protections for LGBTQ people. This included an effort to \u201c define \u2018transgender\u2019 out of existenc e ,\u201d erode protections for transgender students and workers, and weaken access to gender-affirming health care that most transgender people already struggled to access.\n\nThis piece was published before Joe Biden withdrew from the 2024 presidential election and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to represent the Democratic Party. No significant facts have been changed or added.\n\nTrump on LGBTQ Rights\n\nWhy It Matters: A second Trump administration would strip LGBTQ people of protections against discrimination in many contexts, including employment, housing, education, health care, and a range of federal government programs. The Trump administration\u2019s proposed policies would ban transgender people from serving openly in the armed forces and block gender-affirming medical care for transgender people enrolled in federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare. The effects of these cruel \u2013 and unconstitutional \u2013 discrimination efforts would be devastating, as thousands of transgender people would immediately lose access to needed medical care and the right to live freely without fear. In essence, a potential second Trump administration would seek to erase transgender people from public life entirely by using federal laws \u2013 including obscenity laws \u2013 to criminalize gender nonconformity.\n\nThe Facts: Trump has promised that, if reelected, his administration will rescind federal policies that prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, and will assert that federal civil rights laws don\u2019t cover anti-LGBTQ discrimination. In addition to rolling back existing protections, a second Trump administration will proactively mandate discrimination by the federal government wherever it can. Lastly, and perhaps most ominously, if Trump returns to the White House, we expect his administration to use federal law \u2013 including laws meant to safeguard civil rights \u2013 as a cudgel to override critical state-level protections for transgender students and to force state and local governments, as well as private organizations, to allow or even perpetuate discrimination\n\nHow We Got Here: The Trump administration was openly hostile toward the LGBTQ community and vehemently opposed the Equality Act, which would have ensured that existing civil rights protections cover sexual orientation and gender identity in the way that they already do for race, disability, veteran status, and more. The Trump administration also blocked basic job protections for LGBTQ people, insisting that employers should be free to fire workers for their sexual orientation or gender identity. The Department of Health and Human Services under the Trump administration also eliminated nondiscrimination protections for LGBTQ people established under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nCritically, the Trump administration had an enormous impact on the courts, including the Supreme Court. Getting courts to understand the experience of transgender people and the impact of discriminatory policies on their lives was difficult even before Trump reshaped the judiciary. It is that much harder today because of the viewpoints of the judges and justices Trump appointed to the federal courts and Supreme Court.\n\nOur Roadmap: Should a second Trump administration take office, the ACLU will use the courts to affirm that LGBTQ people are protected from discrimination under federal law, to invalidate policies mandating discrimination across the federal government, and to shut down Trump\u2019s expected efforts to weaponize the Constitution and federal laws to require discrimination against LGBTQ people by state and local governments and private entities.\n\nLitigation is not our only pathway to push back against anti-LGBTQ policies. Congress can, and must, use the power of the purse and its oversight and investigative authorities to constrain a second Trump administration\u2019s extreme anti-LGBTQ agenda. The ACLU will aggressively lobby members of Congress who support the transgender community to use the appropriations process, in particular, to hinder Trump\u2019s ability to mandate anti-trans discrimination and weaponize federal law against LGBTQ rights.\n\nThe ACLU also has a comprehensive state-level plan of attack. We will advocate for states and school boards to protect LGBTQ students by enacting guidance regarding updating student names and pronouns, and by creating inclusive rules on gender-based activities, best practices for school records, and ways to support transgender students living under a federal government that discriminates against them. We\u2019ll also urge states to support policies that prevent their governments from being complicit in a second Trump administration\u2019s efforts to attack the legitimacy of transgender people in our world. Lastly, we will mobilize public support on behalf of vulnerable children and youth to deter further draconian policies and help reshape the political narrative around transgender justice.\n\nWhat Our Experts Say: \u201cWe have seen the disastrous consequences of a hateful campaign targeting LGBTQ people and their families with discriminatory laws, forcing many from their home states and denying many more the freedom to get the health care they need to live their lives openly, and even to decide what name to go by. We are determined to use every tool at our disposal to oppose any attempt to deny LGBTQ people the freedom to live and love freely and openly.\u201d \u2013 Mike Zamore, national director for policy & government affairs\n\n\u201cFor four years, President Trump and his administration left no stone unturned in their effort to attack the right of LGBTQ people to live and work as who we are. We fully expect a second Trump administration to go further, weaponizing federal law to override state level protections and mandate discrimination by schools and health care providers nationwide. Regardless of the election\u2019s outcome, we stand ready to fight to uphold the fundamental freedom we are guaranteed by the Constitution to live our lives as we choose.\u201d \u2013 James Esseks, director of the ACLU\u2019s LGBTQ & HIV Project.\n\nWhat You Can Do Today: As wave after wave of extreme measures to criminalize and strip trans people of rights and safety continue, the time to act is now. Tell your members of Congress to protect trans people from discrimination today.\n\nSign up now to receive key issue memos as they're released \u2014 and breaking alerts for all our work for civil liberties.",

        "text": "Will Trump go to prison for felony hush money conviction? Experts are split\nTrump's sentencing in his New York hush money case is scheduled for July 11.\n\nWill Trump go to prison for felony hush money conviction? Experts are split\n\nAfter becoming the first former president to face criminal charges, Donald Trump faces another historic first next month: He could become the first former president in U.S. history to be ordered to prison when he's sentenced in his New York hush money case.\n\nSeveral experts told ABC News that the odds are against the former president serving any time behind bars before the 2024 election, after a jury in May found him guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to an effort to illegally influence the 2016 presidential election.\n\nBut it's possible that the nature and circumstances of Trump's alleged criminal conduct -- in addition to his lack of remorse and behavior during the trial -- could provide Judge Juan Merchan justification to impose a sentence that includes prison time, some experts told ABC News.\n\nOf the 14 lawyers and law professors who spoke with ABC News, five believed an incarceratory sentence was likely, two described the decision as a toss-up, and seven believed a prison sentence was unlikely due to a combination of the logistical challenges, a lack of precedent supporting incarceration for first-time offenders, and the political implications of such a sentence.\n\nRegardless of the punishment, experts broadly agreed that Trump's sentence will most likely be stayed pending his appeal -- a process that could take anywhere from months to a year -- meaning the former president would likely avoid serving any part of a sentence until after the 2024 election.\n\nAhead of the July 11 sentencing, Judge Juan Merchan faces the unprecedented question of how to punish the former president for crimes that prosecutors framed in the sharpest terms -- a \"subversion of democracy\" and \"election fraud, pure and simple\" -- but that were charged using the least severe class of felonies in New York.\n\n\"There is no more serious falsification of business records case that I can remember in the history of supervising and prosecuting many of these cases,\" said Karen Friedman Agnifilo, who previously served as the chief assistant district attorney in the Manhattan district attorney's office.\n\nIn this June 9, 2017, file photo, President Donald Trump is shown at the White House in Washington, D.C. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images, FILE\n\nCompared to judges in federal court -- whose sentences are normally guided by a point system created by the United States Sentencing Commission -- Merchan has fewer reference points when sentencing Trump. New York's penal law limits prison sentences for Class-E felonies to four years, and probation officials will prepare a report with a recommendation for Trump's sentence, which Merchan can consider when weighing the nature and circumstances of the crime along with Trump's history and character.\n\n\"On behalf of New Yorkers -- that's who Judge Merchan is speaking up for -- how big a breach of the social trust was this compared to all the other crimes that he and other judges sentence every day?\" said Justin Levitt, a constitutional law professor at Loyola Law School. \"There is literally no case that has been remotely similar to the criminal prosecution conviction of a former chief executive of the country.\"\n\nHere are six questions that will likely shape how the judge forms his decision.\n\nHow have similar defendants been sentenced?\n\nWhile the Manhattan district attorney frequently charges defendants with falsifying business records -- there were 437 such charges by the office in the decade before Trump's indictment, according to a court filing last year -- Merchan might struggle to find relevant precedent in those cases, experts said.\n\nManhattan DA Alvin Bragg brought his case using a novel legal theory that Trump falsified business records to conceal a violation of a New York election law that prohibits conspiracies to influence an election using unlawful means.\n\n\"This isn't a run-of-the-mill falsifying business records case,\" former Manhattan assistant district attorney Jeremy Saland told ABC News.\n\nWhile first-time offenders convicted of falsifying business records normally avoid prison time, similar cases related to campaign contributions or public officials suggest incarceration is a possibility.\n\nRichard Brega, a New York bus mogul who pleaded guilty to one count of falsifying business records related to illegal campaign contributions, received a one-year prison sentence in 2018. Former New York Comptroller Alan Hevesi, who pleaded guilty to receiving a reward for official misconduct -- a class-E felony -- related to a pay-to-play scheme involving New York's pension fund, was sentenced in 2011 to one-to-four years in prison.\n\n\"Ultimately, this is a case that stands alone, and that is going to be extremely difficult for the judge to come up with a sentence that is fair and appropriate,\" said Robert Mintz, a former federal prosecutor.\n\nWhat factors could lessen Trump's sentence?\n\nTrump's status as a first-time offender, the nonviolent nature of his crime, his advanced age, and a lack of a flight risk are mitigating factors that could lighten his sentence, according to Pace University School of Law professor Bennett L. Gershman.\n\nHowever, Gershman cautioned that while Trump might be 78 years old at the time of his sentencing, many white-collar defendants receive prison time in spite of their advanced age.\n\n\"I would be shocked if he didn't impose some time in jail,\" Gershman said. \"Merchan imposes tough sentences. He's a tough judge from his history on the bench.\"\n\nHas Trump shown remorse?\n\nTrump's lack of remorse or admission of wrongdoing could work against the former president at sentencing, where Merchan can consider Trump's overall history and character. Trump has also frequently targeted Merchan with personal attacks related to his daughter's political work and compared the judge to a \"tyrant\" and \"devil.\"\n\nMerchan also held Trump in criminal contempt ten times during the trial for knowingly making comments about witnesses and jurors in violation of the case's limited gag order.\n\n\"I think that most judges would feel that some kind of jail time is needed to basically affirm the need for a defendant to have respect for the court,\" said George Washington University professor Stephen Saltzburg.\n\nWould a prison sentence be a deterrent?\n\nIn addition to any purported rehabilitative or retributive purpose, prison sentences are often used by judges to deter the defendant or the broader public from committing similar crimes in the future.\n\nSome experts ABC News spoke with were skeptical that Merchan could justify a prison sentence based on individual deterrence -- i.e., discouraging Trump himself from committing a similar crime again.\n\n\"It's not necessarily clear to me that this is a situation that will arise again that could be specifically deterred,\" said former federal prosecutor Jarrod Schaeffer. \"Looking at Trump's behavior and his track record, I'm not sure that the judge will hold out hope that his sentence in this case will have a strong deterrent effect on him.\"\n\nYet the sentencing could provide an opportunity for general deterrence for the public, including other public officials, according to Jeffrey Cohen, a Boston College Law Associate professor.\n\n\"When you have a high-profile defendant, you want your punishment to discourage other people from doing this sort of thing,\" Cohen noted.\n\nWhat other options does Merchan have for Trump's sentence?\n\nMerchan could opt to sentence Trump to a period of probation or a conditional discharge.\n\nIf sentenced to probation, Trump would have to report to a probation officer and meet certain conditions, including potential travel restrictions or curfews that could be enforced with the use of an ankle monitor, according to former federal prosecutor Michael Zweiback. However, enforcing the terms of Trump's probation in the middle of his presidential campaign could be challenging, according to New York Law School professor Anna Cominsky.\n\n\"The more restrictions on someone's movement sometimes makes it more difficult for them to live their lives and do their jobs,\" Cominsky said. \"So when it comes to Trump, part of his job is right now campaigning and traveling around the country. He has to be able to do that.\"\n\nTrump alternatively could be sentenced to a conditional discharge where Judge Merchan himself would oversee that Trump meets the conditions of his release, rather than a probation officer.\n\nThe conditions of Trump's release could include paying a fine, performing community service, and avoiding future arrests.\n\n\"He could be creative here, and I think that's sort of the wildcard, is that the judge does have a lot of discretion in fashioning a sentence,\" said former federal prosecutor Joshua Naftalis.\n\nHow would the sentence impact the election -- and does it matter?\n\nTrump's sentencing comes just four days before the Republican National Convention, and the former president faces the possibility of serving part of his sentence while running for the presidency.\n\nThe political undercurrent adds another layer of complexity to the already thorny sentencing, as the former president continues to allege without evidence that the prosecution against him was politically motivated.\n\nWhile Merchan could opt to disregard the political implications of the sentencing entirely, the broader ramifications of the sentence could play into Merchan's decision about the most effective punishment for the former president.\n\n\"There are political issues around sentencing him to a term of incarceration just before the convention, and that's feeding into a narrative that this prosecution was really to keep him from campaigning and keep him from regaining the office of president,\" said Bader.",

I'll be with you always,\" he said. \"If [a relationship] wasn't fantastic, it gets worked out.\n\n\"We have one thing in mind, and that's making our county great again.\"\n\nTrump did not take questions, but waved and gave a thumbs up at a small group of supporters shouting \"I love you\".\n\n\"Thank you,\" he mouthed in response.\n\nFollowing a meeting between Trump and House Republicans earlier in the day, House Speaker Mike Johnson said the former president \"brought an extraordinary amount of energy and enthusiasm this morning\".\n\n\"That is what we're seeing in the party throughout the country,\" Mr Johnson said. \"We believe we are going to win back the White House, and the Senate, and grow the House majority.\"\n\nMatt Gaetz, a Florida Republican, described Trump's meeting with House Republicans as a \"pep-rally environment\" for the former president.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, told reporters she saw nothing but \"overwhelming support for Trump\" among the party rank-and-file.\n\n\"I am glad to see Republicans here in Washington rallying around President Trump and his candidacy as president,\" she said.\n\nSenate minority leader Mitch McConnell, who has been openly critical of Trump in the past, called the visit \"really positive\".\n\n\"He got a lot of standing ovations,\" Mr McConnell added.\n\nIn addition to Mr McConnell, two other Trump critics within the party - Utah Senator Mitt Romney and Louisiana's Bill Cassidy - were at the meeting.\n\nSenator Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, described Trump as \"extremely gracious\" and \"warm\" to Senate Republicans.\n\n\"I guess I've just been here five years, and that's probably the warmest meeting that I have been in with senators and Trump,\" he told reporters.\n\nMr Hawley said that Trump spoke about abortion \"quite a lot\" at the meeting, where he reiterated his stance that voters should be the ones to decide on the issue.",

        "text": "The U.S. Government and the World Health Organization\nKey Facts\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO), founded in 1948, is a specialized agency of the United Nations with a broad mandate to act as a coordinating authority on international health issues, including helping countries mount responses to public health emergencies such as COVID-19.\n\nThe U.S. government (U.S.) has long been actively engaged with WHO, providing financial and technical support as well as participating in its governance structure.\n\nThe U.S. has historically been one of the largest funders of WHO. U.S. contributions have ranged between $163 million and $816 million annually over the last decade. In 2020, the Trump administration temporarily suspended funding for WHO and initiated a process to end U.S. membership, actions reversed by the Biden administration in 2021.\n\nFor the last two years WHO has overseen negotiation processes to update an existing agreement known as the International Health Regulations (IHR), and to establish a potential new \u201cpandemic agreement\u201d. In May, member states approved a set of revisions to the IHR, but decided to extend the negotiation timeline for a pandemic agreement into next year. In addition, in May WHO also launched its first ever \u201cinvestment round\u201d to mobilize additional resources from existing and new donors.\n\nThe outcome of the U.S. presidential election between former President Trump and sitting President Biden later this year will likely have important consequences for whether the U.S. continues to fund WHO and be a member state of WHO, including participating in the World Health Assembly.\n\nWhat is the World Health Organization?\n\nWHO, founded in 1948, is a specialized agency of the United Nations. As outlined in its constitution, WHO has a broad mandate to \u201cact as the directing and coordinating authority on international health work\u201d within the United Nations system. It has 194 member states.\n\nThe agency has played a key role in a number of past global health achievements, such as the Alma-Ata Declaration on primary health care (1978), the eradication of smallpox (formally recognized in 1980), the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (adopted in 2003), and the 2005 revision of the International Health Regulations (IHR), an international agreement that outlines roles and responsibilities in preparing for and responding to international health emergencies. WHO has regularly provided member states with technical guidance and support during responses to epidemics and pandemics, such as Ebola, Zika, mpox, and COVID-19.\n\nMission and Priorities\n\nWHO\u2019s overarching mission is \u201cattainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of health.\u201d It supports its mission through activities such as:\n\nproviding technical assistance to countries;\n\nsetting international health standards and providing guidance on health issues;\n\ncoordinating and supporting international responses to health emergencies such as disease outbreaks; and\n\npromoting and advocating for better global health.\n\nThe organization also serves as a convener and host for international meetings and discussions on health issues. While WHO is generally not a direct funder of health services and programs in countries, it does provide supplies and other support during emergencies and carries out programs funded by donors.\n\nWHO\u2019s overarching objective for its current work period (2019-2025) has been \u201censuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages.\u201d In pursuit of this objective, it has been focusing on three strategic priorities (the \u201ctriple-billion targets\u201d): helping 1 billion more people benefit from universal health coverage; ensuring 1 billion more people are better protected against health emergencies; and helping 1 billion more people enjoy better health and well-being.\n\nAs part of its work to help countries be better protected against health emergencies \u2013 and propelled by the issues and challenges faced during the COVID-19 pandemic \u2013 WHO has been overseeing two sets of international negotiations among member states:\n\na process to potentially update and amend the International Health Regulations (IHR) agreement, and\n\nthe drafting of a new \u201cpandemic agreement\u201d that aims to institute a number of common principles and mechanisms that would contribute to global prevention, preparedness, and response capacities.\n\nAt the May 2024 World Health Assembly (WHA) meeting, member states did reach consensus and approved a set of revisions to the IHR. On the pandemic agreement, member states have not yet reached consensus and decided to continue negotiations into next year, and set a goal of completing negotiations and voting on the agreement at the May 2025 WHA meeting.\n\nOrganization\n\nWHO has a global reach, with a headquarters office located in Geneva, Switzerland, six semi-autonomous regional offices that oversee activities in each region, and a network of country offices and representatives around the world. It is led by a Director-General (DG), currently Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who was first appointed in 2017 and was re-elected to a second five-year term in May 2022. Dr. Tedros has indicated that his priorities include continuing to strengthen WHO\u2019s financing, staffing, and operations; building pandemic preparedness and response capacities at WHO and elsewhere; and helping countries re-orient health systems toward primary health care and universal health coverage.\n\nWorld Health Assembly\n\nThe World Health Assembly (WHA), comprised of representatives from 194 member states, is the supreme decision-making body for WHO and is convened annually. It is responsible for selecting the Director-General, setting priorities, and approving WHO\u2019s budget and activities. The annual WHA meeting in May also serves as a key forum for nations to debate and make decisions about health policy and WHO organizational issues. Every four years, the WHA negotiates and approves a work plan for WHO, known as the general programme of work (GPW). The current GPW, for 2019-2023, has been extended by the WHA through 2025. Every two years the WHA also approves WHO\u2019s programme budget in support of its work plan; the current programme budget covers the 2024-2025 biennium. More information about WHO\u2019s budget provided below.\n\nExecutive Board\n\nWHO\u2019s Executive Board, comprised of 34 members technically qualified in the field of health, facilitates the implementation of the agency\u2019s work plan and provides proposals and recommendations to the Director-General and the WHA. The 34 members are drawn from six regions as follows:\n\n7 represent Africa,\n\n6 represent the Americas,\n\n5 represent the Eastern Mediterranean,\n\n8 represent Europe,\n\n3 represent South-East Asia, and\n\n5 represent the Western Pacific.\n\nMember states within each region designate members to serve on the Executive Board on a rotating basis. The U.S. currently holds a seat on the Executive Board.\n\nActivities\n\nWHO supports activities across a number of key areas, organized into several \u201cbudget segments,\u201d including \u201cbase programmes,\u201d emergency operations, polio eradication, and \u201cspecial programmes\u201d (see Table 1). \u201cBase programmes\u201d refers to the core support provided for WHO headquarters activities, regional operations, and efforts such as improving access to quality essential health services, essential medicines, vaccines, diagnostics, and devices for primary health care. \u201cEmergency operations\u201d includes WHO efforts to help countries prepare for and respond to epidemics and other health emergencies such as COVID-19, mpox, and natural disasters. \u201cSpecial programmes\u201d includes a number of WHO-led initiatives such as the Research and Training in Tropical Diseases program and Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework activities.\n\nFunding\n\nProgramme Budget\n\nWHO has a programme budget set in advance by member states, which is meant to outline planned activities to meet its work plan over a two-year period (biennium) and describes the \u201cresource levels required to deliver that work.\u201d The current programme budget of $6.834 billion covers the period 2024-2025, and was approved by member states in May 2023. This amount represents a slight (2%) increase over WHO\u2019s previous 2022-2023 programme budget of $6.726 billion. See Table 1.\n\nThe programme budget represents a plan for the organization\u2019s anticipated resources, but actual resources may deviate from the initial budgeted amounts over course of the biennium due to changing or unexpected circumstances, such as additional resources (revenue) provided to WHO for emergency responses or lower levels of support than expected. For example, in the previous biennium (2022-2023) WHO reported programme resources that totaled $8.4 billion due to additional funding in support of emergency operations, including COVID-19 response and polio eradication activities.\n\nRevenue\n\nWHO has two primary sources of revenue:\n\nassessed contributions (set amounts expected to be paid by member-state governments, scaled by income and population) and\n\nvoluntary contributions (other funds provided by member states, plus contributions from private organizations and individuals).\n\nMost assessed contributions are considered \u201ccore\u201d funding, meaning they are flexible funds that are often used to cover general expenses and program activities. Voluntary contributions, on the other hand, are often \u201cspecified\u201d funds, meaning they are earmarked by donors for certain activities. Although decades ago the majority of WHO\u2019s revenue came from assessed contributions, more recently voluntary contributions have comprised the larger share of WHO\u2019s budget. For example, in the previous budget period (2022-2023) assessed contributions totaled $956.9 million (12.1% of total revenue), voluntary contributions totaled $6.92 billion (87.5% of total revenue), and \u201cother revenue\u201d totaled $28.1 million (0.4%). See Figure 1.\n\nReliance on voluntary, relatively inflexible funding has, in WHO\u2019s view, hampered its operations and effectiveness. In 2022, member states, including the U.S., agreed in principle to move toward more predictable, flexible funding for WHO and to reduce the role of specified voluntary contributions. Since then, member states have approved a 20% increase in assessed contributions for the 2024-2025 biennium, and instituted a goal to have 50% of WHO\u2019s programme budget be financed through assessed contributions by 2030 (which could be linked to WHO first meeting certain organizational benchmarks). In addition, member states have approved the launch of WHO\u2019s first-ever \u201cinvestment round, which aims to mobilize additional funding for WHO over the next four years. In its investment case for 2025-2028, WHO estimates it will need $11 billion to implement its global program of work (GPW) over this period, but member state assessments (core contributions) are likely to amount to $4 billion, leaving a $7 billion gap to fill with voluntary contributions and other donations. To help fill this gap, WHO will hold a series of meetings and \u201cpledging moments,\u201d culminating in a high-level event around the G20 leaders\u2019 summit in Brazil in November 2024, through which it aims to attract new donors and additional commitments from existing donors.\n\nChallenges\n\nWHO faces a number of institutional challenges, including:\n\na scope of responsibility that has expanded over time with little growth in core, non-emergency funding;\n\nan inflexible budget dominated in recent years by less predictable voluntary contributions often earmarked for specific activities;\n\na cumbersome, decentralized, and bureaucratic governance structure; and\n\na dual mandate of being both a technical agency with health expertise and a political body where states debate and negotiate on sometimes divisive health issues.\n\nThese and other challenges were particularly evident during and after perceived failures of the agency in the response to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa (2014-2015), and in the criticisms directed at WHO as it tried to help coordinate a global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Even as many member states continue to support WHO and recognize its importance for global health, many are also calling for reforms to the organization that would help address its weaknesses. WHO itself supports reforms in several areas and has taken some internal reform actions, while also launching its new \u201cinvestment round\u201d and ushering negotiation processes to revise the International Health Regulations and establish a new pandemic accord, each of which includes reforms to WHO practices.\n\nU.S. Engagement with WHO\n\nThe U.S. government has long been engaged with WHO in multiple ways including through financial support, participation in governance and diplomacy, and joint activities (see below). In 2020, after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Trump administration suspended financial support and initiated a process to withdraw the U.S. from membership in the organization, marking a turning point in the U.S. relationship with WHO. Under the Biden administration, U.S. relations with the organization were re-established in January 2021, and U.S. funding to WHO was restored. The outcome of the upcoming U.S. presidential election between former President Trump and sitting President Biden later this year will likely have important consequences for whether the U.S. continues, or again withdraws from, participation in and support for WHO.\n\nFinancial Support\n\nOne of the main ways in which the U.S. government supports WHO is through its assessed and voluntary contributions. The U.S. has historically been the single largest contributor to WHO. In the 2020-2021 period (when the Trump administration withheld some U.S. funding during the COVID-19 pandemic), it was the third largest since other donors, notably Germany and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, increased their contributions in response to COVID-19. The Biden administration restored funding starting in 2021 and in the 2022-2023 period the U.S. was once again the largest contributor to WHO.\n\nFor many years, the assessed contribution for the U.S. has been set at 22% of all member state assessed contributions, the maximum allowed rate. Between FY 2015 and FY 2024, the U.S. assessed contribution has been fairly stable, fluctuating between $109 million and $122 million (in FY 2019 and FY 2020 the U.S. actually paid less than its assessed amount, and in FY 2021 it paid more than that amount due to payments made toward outstanding arrears). See Figure 2.\n\nVoluntary contributions for specific projects or activities, on the other hand, have varied to reflect changing U.S. priorities and/or support during international crises. Over the past decade, U.S. voluntary contributions have ranged from a low of $105 million in FY 2020 to a high of $694 million in FY 2022. Higher amounts of voluntary contributions can be reflective of increased U.S. support for specific WHO activities such as emergency response. U.S. voluntary contributions also support a range of other WHO activities such as polio eradication; maternal, newborn, and child health programs; mental health services for victims of torture and trauma; health coordination in COVID-19 response; and other infectious diseases.\n\nWHO reports that U.S. assessed and voluntary contributions together represented 15.6% of WHO\u2019s total revenue in the 2022-2023 biennium, making the U.S. was the largest donor to WHO during that period.\n\nGovernance Activities\n\nThe U.S. is an active participant in WHO governance, including through the Executive Board and the World Health Assembly (WHA). The U.S. currently holds a seat on the WHO Executive Board through 2025. The U.S. has historically been an active and engaged member of the WHA, sending a large delegation each year that has typically been led by a representative from the Department of Health and Human Services, with multiple other U.S. agencies and departments also participating. The U.S. is also actively participating in the ongoing negotiations to develop a new pandemic agreement and participated in the recent process to update and amend the IHR agreement.\n\nTechnical Support\n\nThe U.S. provides technical support to WHO through a variety of activities and partnerships. This includes U.S. government experts and resources supporting research and reference laboratory work via WHO collaborating centres and participation of U.S. experts on advisory panels and advisory groups convened by WHO. The U.S. contributions to WHO collaborating centres include technical areas such as cancer, occupational health, nutrition, chronic diseases, and improving health technologies. In addition, U.S. government representatives are often seconded to or have served as liaisons at WHO headquarters and WHO regional offices, working day-to-day with staff on technical efforts.\n\nPartnering Activities\n\nThe U.S. has also worked in partnership with WHO before and during responses to outbreaks and other international health emergencies, including participating in international teams that WHO organizes to investigate and respond to outbreaks around the world. For example, the U.S. worked with WHO and the broader multilateral response to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa that began in 2014, and U.S. scientists were part of the WHO delegation that visited China in February 2020 to assess its response to COVID-19. To help further develop areas of partnership and coordination, the Biden administration has instituted semi-regular \u201cstrategic dialogue\u201d meetings to create a regular forum for discussions between key U.S. and WHO officials.",

        "text": "Two weeks since Trump\u2019s New York guilty verdict: What have we learned?\nTrump\u2019s history-making \u2018hush-money\u2019 verdict has only caused ripples so far in polls as he seeks re-election in November.\n\nWashington, DC \u2013 It has been two weeks since Donald Trump became the first former United States president convicted of criminal charges. But polls show the extraordinary verdict has largely been met with a resounding ho-hum.\n\nOn May 30, Trump was found guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, in what prosecutors described as an effort to conceal a hush-money payment to a porn star.\n\nBut experts say the public response to the verdict has been a ripple rather than a tidal wave \u2014 and that is a reflection of the unique political moment the US finds itself in.\n\nTrump is seeking re-election in November, and he is in a tight race against current President Joe Biden. But his campaign has been bolstered by strong support among Republicans, who have largely rallied under his leadership.\n\nAllan Lichtman, a professor of history at American University, credited the muted reaction following May\u2019s historic verdict to the Republican Party \u2014 and the media \u2014 normalising what should be remarkable.\n\n\u201cWe never, in the 230 years plus of American history, have had a former president, or even a major party presidential candidate, charged with a crime, much less convicted of multiple felonies,\u201d Lichtman told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cThis is a cataclysmic event without precedent, and at least so far, it doesn\u2019t seem to have much of an impact on people\u2019s views of Donald Trump.\u201d\n\n\u2018Hush money\u2019 vs \u2018scheme to defraud\u2019\n\nAccording to Lichtman, the subdued response has been, in many ways, a culmination of Trump\u2019s years-long effort to build a perception of both political impunity and persecution.\n\nTrump bragged in 2016 that he could shoot someone on New York City\u2019s Fifth Avenue and still \u201cnot lose any voters\u201d. He ultimately won that year\u2019s presidential race.\n\nNevertheless, for years, he has also promoted \u2014 without evidence \u2014 the claim that he is the target of a coordinated political \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d, designed to keep him from power.\n\nLichtman added that the media\u2019s coverage of the trial also contributed to the beige public reaction.\n\nThe trial, which took place in New York City, hinged on the prosecution\u2019s argument that Trump covered up the hush-money payment to protect his chances in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nTrump has denied the charges. But prosecutors maintained he used illegal means to conceal information from the American electorate.\n\nThe fact that the media referred to the trial as the \u201chush-money\u201d case contributed to the lack of outrage, Lichtman said. He believes the verdict would have resounded more if the media had framed the case as a question of \u201cfraud perpetrated on the American people\u201d.\n\n\u201cTrump has played the media like a fiddle,\u201d Lichtman explained. \u201cThen, let\u2019s not forget, virtually to a person, the entire Republican Party has bought into his lies that he was convicted by a rigged system in a phoney trial.\u201d\n\nA litmus test for voters\n\nThat was a message Trump and his campaign helped calcify as the New York verdict approached.\n\nIn a news conference after being found guilty, the former president sought to directly tie his conviction to the Biden administration, without providing evidence for the claim.\n\n\u201cThis is all done by Biden and his people,\u201d Trump said in the news conference. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with a corrupt government. We have a corrupt country.\u201d\n\nShortly after, he again raised the spectre of political violence if he were to be imprisoned.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure the public would stand for it,\u201d Trump told Fox News. \u201cYou know, at a certain point, there\u2019s a breaking point.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, his campaign even sent out an email titled, \u201cHaul out the Guillotine\u201d, a reference to the French Revolution.\n\nFor his part, Biden \u2013 through campaign communications and the White House \u2013 has portrayed the conviction of proof of a healthy and impartial justice system.\n\nThe New York trial is far from the end of Trump\u2019s legal woes. He faces separate state and federal charges related to efforts to subvert his 2020 election loss to Biden, as well as a fourth indictment in Florida for allegedly hoarding classified documents.\n\nBut none of the other cases are expected to conclude before the presidential race on November 5.\n\nThat means the New York trial offers the first \u2013 and perhaps only \u2013 litmus test for how a criminal conviction will be viewed by the nearly 160 million registered voters in the US.\n\nMuted fallout in polls\n\nSince the verdict, there has been evidence that Trump\u2019s strategy has helped to energise his supporters. His campaign claimed to have raised $141m in May, including two million small-money donations.\n\nMore than a third of those donations were made online in the 24 hours after the verdict, according to Trump\u2019s campaign, although the official fundraising filings for the period have not yet been released.\n\nThen, there have been a series of polls that have shown a broadly ambivalent response to the prospect of electing a convicted felon as president.\n\nA Reuters-Ipsos poll conducted immediately after the verdict found that only 10 percent of registered Republicans reported they were less likely to vote for Trump after the conviction.\n\nMeanwhile, 56 percent of Republicans said the case would have no effect on their vote. Another 35 percent indicated it would make them more likely to vote for Trump.\n\nThe verdict\u2019s impact was more pronounced among independent voters, a coveted demographic in US politics.\n\nApproximately 25 percent of the independent voters surveyed said Trump\u2019s conviction made them less likely to support him in November, compared with 18 percent who said they were more likely to vote for him.\n\nHowever, the majority of the group \u2014 56 percent \u2014 said the conviction would have no impact on their decision.\n\nStill, two weeks after the verdict, most major polls and forecasters show Biden and Trump neck and neck in the presidential race, although several leading organisations \u2014 including FiveThirtyEight and Morning Consult \u2014 put Biden ahead with a slight edge.\n\nThis week, CBS News and YouGov released another poll showing the candidates virtually tied in the battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nHowever, as before, the majority of the voters surveyed said the New York conviction was not a factor in how they would cast their ballot come November.\n\nMichael Fauntroy, the founding director of the Race, Politics and Policy Center at George Mason University, told Al Jazeera the cascade of post-verdict polls demonstrates one thing: \u201cTrump has been hurt, but not mortally so.\u201d\n\nWill public sentiment reflect on ballot?\n\nBut the November 5 election is still more than four months away. That could help or hurt Trump.\n\nExperts note that the public\u2019s attention span is short \u2014 and already, other high-profile news items have diverted focus away from the New York verdict.\n\nThey include the conviction of Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, on charges he lied on a federal firearm background check form. The verdict represents the first time a sitting president\u2019s child has been found guilty of criminal charges.\n\nThe Trump campaign sought to play up the conviction as evidence of what it calls the \u201cBiden crime family\u201d. But the verdict could also prove a double-edged sword, with some observers noting the case may neutralise Trump\u2019s claim that the judiciary is corrupted by political bias.\n\nAfter all, the Hunter Biden case was prosecuted by the Department of Justice, which falls under Biden\u2019s White House. And the president has ruled out pardoning his son.\n\nThen there is Trump\u2019s upcoming sentencing hearing on July 11. The severity of the penalty is expected to impact voter opinion.\n\nFauntroy cautioned that the eventual sentence may make Trump\u2019s conviction stickier and more difficult for his campaign to navigate.\n\n\u201cThe sentencing may well accelerate the concern that Republicans have,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat if he gets jail time? What if he gets house arrest? What if he gets 30 days house arrest? What if he gets 1,000 hours of community service?\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s sentence, Fauntroy explained, \u201ccould be potentially very problematic for him\u201d.\n\nEven slight fluctuations in the polls could also spell trouble for Trump. Any dip in support could make the difference in an election that is expected to turn on a knife\u2019s edge.\n\n\u201cIt could have a small, immediate impact but a large ultimate impact,\u201d Fauntroy said, \u201cif the number of Republicans who are repulsed by this remains as it is now.\u201d\n\nAnd there is perhaps a larger reason for the disquiet looming over Trump\u2019s camp, he added.\n\nSeveral polls, including those conducted by Morning Consult and ABC News/Ipsos, have found a majority of Americans think the guilty verdict was correct. Fauntroy explained that shows a persistent vulnerability that could later be activated by Trump\u2019s opponents.\n\n\u201cRight now, it\u2019s a slight negative for Trump,\u201d Fauntroy said, \u201cbut potentially a really bad one going forward.\u201d",

        "text": "Exposing Russia\u2019s subversive activity and electoral interference targeting Moldova: joint statement by the US, Canada, and the UK\nStatement by the governments of Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America:\n\nWe, the governments of Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America, are united in confronting Russia\u2019s aggression and subversion against democratic societies. We continue to support Ukraine as it defends its freedom and independence from Russia\u2019s illegal and unjustified full-scale invasion. We also stand firmly against persistent Kremlin attempts to use disinformation, criminal and covert activities, and corruption to undermine sovereignty and democratic processes.\n\nFree, fair, and independent elections are the cornerstone of any democratic society. We have consistently witnessed Russia\u2019s attempts to influence, subvert, and undermine democratic elections in order to secure results favorable to the Kremlin.\n\nThis threat is especially relevant in 2024, a year when hundreds of millions of people across Europe and North America go to the polls to select their leaders in European, national, regional, and local elections.\n\nThe Kremlin relies on lies, deceit, corruption and disinformation to undermine sovereignty and democracy. While democracy thrives on openness and truth-telling, authoritarianism and disinformation depend on secrecy and deception.\n\nWe want to address today the Kremlin\u2019s actions in Moldova. President Maia Sandu and Moldova\u2019s security institutions have warned that the Kremlin is seeking to undermine Moldovan democratic institutions in the leadup to the October presidential elections and a referendum on Moldova\u2019s EU membership. We share President Sandu\u2019s strong concerns about the Kremlin\u2019s use of criminal groups to finance political activities and undermine Moldova\u2019s democratic institutions. We commend Moldova\u2019s leaders for continuing to capably manage these threats, build resilience, and maintain peace and security, while driving forward democratic reforms and reviving the country\u2019s economy.\n\nThat is why today, in defense of our shared democratic values, we are taking this step to warn our democratic partners and Allies that Russian actors are carrying out a plot to influence the outcomes of Moldova\u2019s fall 2024 presidential election. They intend to incite protests in Moldova should a pro-Russia candidate not win.\n\nThey seek to foment negative public perceptions of Western governments and Moldova\u2019s incumbent leadership, while degrading public confidence in Moldova\u2019s ability to secure itself and maintain rule of law.\n\nRussia is currently supporting candidates for Moldova\u2019s presidency and is exacerbating societal tensions. These Russian actors are actively using disinformation and propaganda online, on the air, and on the streets to further their objectives.\n\nThey are agitating criticism of the incumbent Moldovan president\u2019s government and political party, in order to incite protests.\n\nPart of these operations would include spreading lies about the incumbent president\u2019s character and intentions, and about supposed electoral irregularities.\n\nIf Russia\u2019s election meddling proves unsuccessful in Moldova, there is reason to believe Moscow will work to incite protests.\n\nRussia\u2019s political interference in Moldova in the lead-up to the October election goes back years. For example, personnel of state-funded media outlet RT have been involved in providing direct support to fugitive Moldovan Ilan Shor for several years with Russian government assent. All three of our governments have sanctioned Shor for his destabilizing electoral activities.\n\nWe have full confidence in Moldova\u2019s ability to manage these threats linked to the Kremlin\u2019s interference. We are taking a range of measures to support those efforts as part of our partnership with Moldova and its people. We have shared the information outlined above, and additional details, with our Moldovan partners so that they can further investigate, thwart, and disrupt the Kremlin\u2019s plans. We will continue to work closely with the Moldovan government on this.\n\nWe will also continue to promote accountability for those involved in these Kremlin-sponsored schemes to covertly finance political activities in Moldova. And we have sanctioned \u2013 and will continue to take action against \u2013 those individuals and entities attempting to destabilize Moldova\u2019s democratic institutions.\n\nWe will continue to support Moldova and the Moldovan people as they manage Kremlin interference and the impacts of Russia\u2019s brutal war against Ukraine. We strongly support Moldova\u2019s democratic, economic, security, and anti-corruption reforms.\n\nBy revealing the Kremlin\u2019s plot, we are making it clear to Moscow that we stand for free and fair elections and will not tolerate its attempts to meddle and undermine democratic processes. We urge the Kremlin to abandon these efforts to subvert Moldova\u2019s democracy and to respect its sovereignty and the outcomes of free, fair, and independent elections.\n\nWe will continue to stand with all of our friends, partners, and Allies in defense of our shared democratic values and freedoms.",

        "text": "Trials Have Little Impact on 2024 Race | Monmouth University Polling Institute\nDownload This Poll Report with Crosstabs\n\nNational\n\nWest Long Branch, NJ \u2013 More voters agree than disagree with a New York jury\u2019s guilty verdict against former President Donald Trump. What does that mean for preferences in the upcoming election? Very little, according to the latest Monmouth (\u201cMon-muth\u201d) University Poll. Trump and President Joe Biden continue to draw almost identical levels of support, although voter enthusiasm for this rematch has increased among both Republicans and Democrats. The poll also finds that most voters think the criminal charges against Trump were politically motivated, while nearly half say the same about the recent trial involving the current president\u2019s son, Hunter Biden.\n\nNearly half (47%) of American voters agree with the jury\u2019s verdict finding Trump guilty of falsifying business records, while 34% disagree. One in 5 have no opinion, but when pressed for a response, they split about evenly between agreeing and disagreeing with the verdict. Among Republicans, just 11% agree with the verdict and 66% disagree with it; among Democrats, 87% agree and only 4% disagree; and among independents, 44% agree and 32% disagree.\n\nJust under 6 in 10 voters (57%) think it is likely that the decision to bring these charges against Trump was politically motivated. This includes 93% of Republicans and 60% of independents, but just 17% of Democrats. As a comparison, 48% of voters think the charges against Hunter Biden were politically motivated. This includes 63% of Democrats and 47% of independents, as well as 34% of Republicans \u2013 which is twice the number of Democrats who say the charges in Trump\u2019s trial were politically motivated. [Note: the poll was completed prior to Tuesday\u2019s verdict in the Biden case.]\n\n\u201cMany Americans are skeptical about these high profile trials and there is a clear partisan gap depending on which defendant we are talking about. Still, the results indicate Republicans have a higher level of distrust in our judicial process than Democrats do,\u201d said Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute.\n\nTaken together, 27% of voters feel that the charges in both trials were politically motivated. Another 29% say this was true only in Trump\u2019s case and 21% say this was true only in Biden\u2019s case. Just 17% say neither case was driven by politically motives. A follow-up question asked voters with differing views on these cases to describe in their own words why they feel that way. Many of those who think only Trump\u2019s trial was politically motivated say his actions weren\u2019t really criminal, that a state court wrongly tried what should have been federal charges if they were true, and that the New York City venue was inherently biased. They also believe the Hunter Biden case was more clear-cut. Among those who think Biden\u2019s trial was politically motivated, some feel that it was done only to get at his father, in part to balance the fact that Trump was facing trial. Responses also pointed to the fact that a plea deal was in the works but rejected as evidence of political motivation in the Biden case.\n\nIn the end, almost nothing has changed in voter intentions about the upcoming election since before these trials began. Just over 4 in 10 registered voters say they will either definitely (31%) or probably (12%) vote for the Democratic incumbent and, in a separate question, a nearly identical number will definitely (32%) or probably (12%) support the former Republican president. About half say they will definitely not vote for Biden (49%) and an identical number say they have definitely ruled out Trump (49%). These results have not moved much since last fall.\n\nEnthusiasm for a rematch between the 2020 presidential candidates has increased over the past few months. Currently, just under half express some level of enthusiasm for the contest between Biden and Trump \u2013 26% very and 22% somewhat enthusiastic. This combined level of 48% who are enthusiastic marks a continued increase in enthusiasm from just 27% in December and 39% in April. This increase has occurred among all partisan groups, but Republicans (71%) remain much more eager than Democrats (46%) about the upcoming rematch. Independents (34%), on the other hand, are among the least enthusiastic voters.\n\n\u201cVoter enthusiasm has a limited impact on actual turnout. But it is interesting how the partisan gap on this metric continues to favor Republicans as enthusiasm increases the closer we get to Election Day,\u201d said Murray.\n\nOne subset of the electorate who are almost universally apathetic about having to choose between Biden and Trump are those described as double haters \u2013 voters who hold an unfavorable view of both candidates. Nearly 1 in 5 registered voters (19%) fall into this category and 83% of them say they are not at all enthusiastic about the upcoming replay of the 2020 presidential election. The incumbent has a slight advantage among this double hater group in terms of their vote intention, with 28% saying they are definite or probable Biden voters and 19% saying they are definite or probable Trump supporters. However, most double haters (54%) say they will not vote for either candidate. Overall, just 2% of American voters have a favorable opinion of both candidates, 41% have a favorable view of Trump only and 38% have a favorable view of Biden only.\n\nIn other poll findings, 48% of voters say they support the Republican congressional candidate in their U.S. House district, while 45% currently back the Democrat. Among independent voters, Republican candidates have a 47% to 39% advantage over Democrats on the generic House ballot.\n\nThe Monmouth University Poll was conducted by telephone from June 6 to 10, 2024 with 1,106 adults in the United States.

Interviews were conducted in English, and included 262 live landline telephone interviews, 348 live cell phone interviews, and 496 online surveys via a cell phone text invitation. Telephone numbers were selected through a mix of random digit dialing and list-based sampling. Landline respondents were selected with a modified Troldahl-Carter youngest adult household screen. Interviewing services were provided by Braun Research, with sample obtained from Dynata (RDD, n= 756), Aristotle (list, n= 182) and a panel of prior Monmouth poll participants (n= 168). Monmouth is responsible for all aspects of the survey design, data weighting and analysis. The full sample is weighted for region, age, education, gender and race based on US Census information (ACS 2022 one-year survey). The results in this poll release are based on a subsample of 1,034 registered voters. For results based on the sample of registered voters, one can say with 95% confidence that the error attributable to sampling has a maximum margin of plus or minus 3.9 percentage points adjusted for sample design effects (1.66). Sampling error can be larger for sub-groups (see table below). In addition to sampling error, one should bear in mind that question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of opinion polls.\n\nDemographics (weighted)\n\nParty (self-reported): 30% Republican, 41% Independent, 30% Democrat\n\nSex: 49% male, 50% female, 1% other\n\nAge: 25% 18-34, 34% 35-54, 40% 55+\n\nRace: 63% White, 12% Black, 16% Hispanic, 9% Asian/other\n\nEducation: 33% high school or less, 31% some college, 19% 4 year degree, 16% graduate degree\n\nClick on pdf file link below for full methodology and crosstabs by key demographic groups.",

        "text": "Exclusive: Biden expected to announce protections for certain undocumented immigrants\nPresident Joe Biden is expected to announce a new executive action as early as next week that would shield certain undocumented immigrants living in the United States from deportation, according to five sources familiar with the White House\u2019s plans.\n\nThe action is expected to protect undocumented spouses of U.S. citizens from deportation and allow them to work legally in the country. The program could also provide a more streamlined pathway to U.S. citizenship.\n\nBiden is expected to make the announcement Tuesday, according to multiple sources, at a planned White House event marking the 12th anniversary of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which shielded more than 800,000 children brought to the U.S. as children from deportation.\n\nA White House official said no final decisions have been made on what additional executive actions might be taken. White House spokesperson Angelo Fern\u00e1ndez Hern\u00e1ndez added that the administration \u201ccontinues to explore a series of policy options and we remain committed to taking action to address our broken immigration system.\u201d\n\nIf implemented, it\u2019s unclear how many undocumented spouses would receive protections, but some lawmakers and immigration advocates have estimated it could affect up to 1.1 million people. But sources with knowledge of the White House\u2019s plans told PBS News Hour they expect the scope of such protections to be much narrower.\n\nWATCH: Sen. Mark Kelly explains why he supports Biden\u2019s plan to limit who can seek asylum\n\nThe White House has been reviewing a program known as \u201cparole in place\u201d that would allow people to adjust their status without having to leave the country, making it possible for them to receive a work permit and a green card.\n\nThe protections for undocumented spouses could come roughly two weeks after Biden issued a separate executive action to temporarily ban asylum-seekers from entering the country between ports of entry.\n\nThe president himself hinted at such an action last week when announcing the crackdown on asylum.\n\n\u201cFor those who say the steps I\u2019ve taken are too strict, I say to you \u2026 be patient,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIn the weeks ahead \u2014 and I mean the weeks ahead \u2014 I will speak to how we can make our immigration system more fair and more just.\u201d\n\nWATCH: How some Pennsylvania Republicans are using a congressional race to protest GOP extremism\n\nThe president\u2019s move to crack down on migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border received harsh criticism from immigration advocates and a number of Latino lawmakers in Congress. On Wednesday, immigrant rights groups and the American Civil Liberties Union sued the Biden administration over the asylum order.\n\nStill, less than five months out from the election, Biden has moved rapidly in recent weeks to implement tougher enforcement on the border. But this expected new action to protect undocumented spouses could also provide the president a political boost with Latino voters and his base.\n\nWATCH: White House asks judge to change protections for migrant children in government custody\n\nThe Congressional Hispanic Caucus and immigrant advocacy groups have requested for months that the White House act on work permits and deportation protections for undocumented people married to U.S. citizens. In recent meetings with Biden, White House officials and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, lawmakers have pushed the issue, receiving positive signals in return, multiple sources involved in the meetings told the PBS News Hour.\n\nLatino lawmakers and immigrant advocates have also encouraged the White House to consider similar protections and work permits for undocumented caregivers and farm workers living in the U.S.\n\nDemocrats have been eager to point out that such an executive action could help their party on the campaign trail as they work to shore up Latino voters in the battlegrounds of Arizona and Nevada.\n\nPBS News Hour first reported that the White House was considering protections for undocumented spouses of U.S. citizens last week.",

        "text": "Could Labour\u2019s massive poll lead affect, as well as reflect, how it performs at the election? Three things the evidence tells us\nMatthew Barnfield, Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the School of Politics and International Relations at Queen Mary University of London has written for 'The Conversation' on Labour\u2019s massive poll lead affect, as well as reflect, how it performs at the election?\nMatthew Barnfield, Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the School of Politics and International Relations at Queen Mary University of London has written for 'The Conversation' on Labour\u2019s massive poll lead affect, as well as reflect, how it performs at the election?\nThe 2024 election is shaping up to be the most opinion-poll-heavy ever in the UK. And when so many polls are flying around, it can start to feel like they are setting the agenda as much as measuring the mood. It is often claimed that being routinely reminded that lots of people intend to vote for a party can drive others to support them, too.\nIn the case of the 2024 election, this would mean that Labour, ahead in the polls for over a year, would be gathering more support just by virtue of being ahead.\nBut, look into\u00a0the evidence\u00a0on whether such a \u201cbandwagon effect\u201d exists and you might be left wanting. And if any such effect exists, it could be more likely to result in a surge for Reform UK.\nIn the first few weeks of the campaign alone, more than 30 vote intention polls were published by members of the British Polling Council, an organisation that promotes quality polling. Beyond so-called \u201chouse effects\u201d, which\u00a0see pollsters differ\u00a0from each other on the precise numbers, the story told by these polls has been\u00a0consistent throughout. The Labour party is well ahead of the Conservatives, and Rishi Sunak\u2019s party shows little sign of making up the ground.\nHere are three things that we know about how such polling does \u2013 and does not \u2013 change an election campaign.\nWhile all parties rightly want to take the lead in the polls, being ahead can be something of a mixed blessing. Information conveying certainty about an election outcome can\u00a0suppress turnout, which is something Labour might want to keep an eye on, especially in seats it is defending.\u00a0Recent research\u00a0shows that when a party leads significantly in the polls, lower turnout is detrimental to its incumbent MPs. Perceiving the election as a foregone conclusion could encourage complacency among Labour supporters in Labour strongholds.\nIt has been claimed that in the 1948 US presidential election, when the polls infamously inspired the erroneous headline \u201cDewey defeats Truman\u201d, supporters of the losing Republican candidate (Dewey)\u00a0\u201cfelt their candidate would win so they played golf that day\u201d.\nWhile it is unlikely that the polls alone suppressed Republican turnout enough to sway the overall result of the election, reminding voters that an election performance on par with current polling requires their participation may be a wise move.\nOthers\u00a0interpret the \u201cDewey defeats Truman\u201d case differently, pointing out that although Dewey led in the polls throughout the 1948 campaign, Truman gained ground over time, halving his opponent\u2019s lead a fortnight out from the election. This momentum in itself might have contributed to Truman\u2019s success.\nWe know that changes in a party\u2019s polling performance can significantly\u00a0raise voters\u2019 expectations\u00a0of its chances of winning. Research from the\u00a0Netherlands,\u00a0Denmark, and\u00a0Germany\u00a0even suggests that these changes can produce a dynamic bandwagon effect, in which people support a party not because it is the most popular, but because it is becoming more popular.\nSo, to the extent that Labour\u2019s constant large lead in the polls produces further electoral benefits for the party, it may be as much about preventing the Conservatives from gaining momentum as about bringing voters onto its own bandwagon.\nThe party with the\u00a0most notable momentum right now, and the most likely to benefit from the dynamic bandwagon effect, however, is not the Conservatives but Reform UK.\nThe rightwing party has been boosted by newly appointed leader Nigel Farage\u2019s announcement that he is running as a candidate in the election. Psephologists\u00a0anticipate\u00a0that any increase in Reform UK\u2019s vote share will eat into the Conservatives\u2019 share, not only further consolidating Labour\u2019s lead, but making that lead matter in key constituencies and\u00a0costing the Conservatives many seats.\nSome even speculate that we could, in the very near future, see Reform UK overtake the Conservatives in the polls. Leapfrogging the Tories into second place could certainly give Reform UK a rhetorical advantage in being able to pitch itself as the party with momentum.\nThe sheer volume of polls in this election might concern those who\u00a0think that the polls affect voters\u2019 behaviour. A\u00a0House of Lords select committee report\u00a0has even cited the bandwagon effect as a reason for toughening up oversight over polling.\nIn truth, however, there is very little evidence that polls produce this kind of effect. A recent\u00a0large-scale study\u00a0spanning multiple countries found that those exposed to polls in simulated election campaigns were no more likely to support the leading party than those who received no polling information, reinforcing\u00a0decades of research\u00a0finding little-to-mixed evidence of bandwagon effects.\nThis lack of a bandwagon effect doesn\u2019t seem to be due to how much attention people are paying to polls. Voters tend to have a\u00a0good sense\u00a0of how parties are currently polling: most can accurately\u00a0identify who is in the lead, and many attribute that knowledge to the polls. So, by now, many British voters probably do know that Labour has a big polling lead, but that knowledge in itself is not likely to convince many of them to jump on the bandwagon.\nIn reality, Labour\u2019s lead in the polls is so large that it is unlikely any of these effects would make much of a difference to its chances of winning the election. While the polls do seem to influence the vote, they mostly just measure it.\nBut if Labour wants its lead to work in its favour, it should avoid relying on simplistic ideas about the bandwagon effect. To the extent that Labour\u2019s campaign incorporates its polling performance, it should carry on warning against complacency and doing everything it can to prevent the Conservatives from gaining any momentum \u2013 with a little help, perhaps, from Reform UK.\nThis article first appeared in 'The Conversation' on 12 June 2024.\nFor media information, contact:\nQueen Mary University of London\n

Three things the evidence tells us\r\n        \n\n\nMatthew Barnfield, Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the School of Politics and International Relations at Queen Mary University of London has written for 'The Conversation' on Labour\u2019s massive poll lead affect, as well as reflect, how it performs at the election?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublished on: \n13 June 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2024 election is shaping up to be the most opinion-poll-heavy ever in the UK. And when so many polls are flying around, it can start to feel like they are setting the agenda as much as measuring the mood. It is often claimed that being routinely reminded that lots of people intend to vote for a party can drive others to support them, too.\nIn the case of the 2024 election, this would mean that Labour, ahead in the polls for over a year, would be gathering more support just by virtue of being ahead.\nBut, look into\u00a0the evidence\u00a0on whether such a \u201cbandwagon effect\u201d exists and you might be left wanting. And if any such effect exists, it could be more likely to result in a surge for Reform UK.\nIn the first few weeks of the campaign alone, more than 30 vote intention polls were published by members of the British Polling Council, an organisation that promotes quality polling. Beyond so-called \u201chouse effects\u201d, which\u00a0see pollsters differ\u00a0from each other on the precise numbers, the story told by these polls has been\u00a0consistent throughout. The Labour party is well ahead of the Conservatives, and Rishi Sunak\u2019s party shows little sign of making up the ground.\n\nHere are three things that we know about how such polling does \u2013 and does not \u2013 change an election campaign.\n1. Poll leads can suppress turnout\nWhile all parties rightly want to take the lead in the polls, being ahead can be something of a mixed blessing. Information conveying certainty about an election outcome can\u00a0suppress turnout, which is something Labour might want to keep an eye on, especially in seats it is defending.\u00a0Recent research\u00a0shows that when a party leads significantly in the polls, lower turnout is detrimental to its incumbent MPs. Perceiving the election as a foregone conclusion could encourage complacency among Labour supporters in Labour strongholds.\nIt has been claimed that in the 1948 US presidential election, when the polls infamously inspired the erroneous headline \u201cDewey defeats Truman\u201d, supporters of the losing Republican candidate (Dewey)\u00a0\u201cfelt their candidate would win so they played golf that day\u201d.\nWhile it is unlikely that the polls alone suppressed Republican turnout enough to sway the overall result of the election, reminding voters that an election performance on par with current polling requires their participation may be a wise move.\n2. Reform could benefit from poll momentum\nOthers\u00a0interpret the \u201cDewey defeats Truman\u201d case differently, pointing out that although Dewey led in the polls throughout the 1948 campaign, Truman gained ground over time, halving his opponent\u2019s lead a fortnight out from the election. This momentum in itself might have contributed to Truman\u2019s success.\nWe know that changes in a party\u2019s polling performance can significantly\u00a0raise voters\u2019 expectations\u00a0of its chances of winning. Research from the\u00a0Netherlands,\u00a0Denmark, and\u00a0Germany\u00a0even suggests that these changes can produce a dynamic bandwagon effect, in which people support a party not because it is the most popular, but because it is becoming more popular.\nSo, to the extent that Labour\u2019s constant large lead in the polls produces further electoral benefits for the party, it may be as much about preventing the Conservatives from gaining momentum as about bringing voters onto its own bandwagon.\nThe party with the\u00a0most notable momentum right now, and the most likely to benefit from the dynamic bandwagon effect, however, is not the Conservatives but Reform UK.\nThe rightwing party has been boosted by newly appointed leader Nigel Farage\u2019s announcement that he is running as a candidate in the election. Psephologists\u00a0anticipate\u00a0that any increase in Reform UK\u2019s vote share will eat into the Conservatives\u2019 share, not only further consolidating Labour\u2019s lead, but making that lead matter in key constituencies and\u00a0costing the Conservatives many seats.\nSome even speculate that we could, in the very near future, see Reform UK overtake the Conservatives in the polls. Leapfrogging the Tories into second place could certainly give Reform UK a rhetorical advantage in being able to pitch itself as the party with momentum.\n3. The bandwagon effect is overhyped\nThe sheer volume of polls in this election might concern those who\u00a0think that the polls affect voters\u2019 behaviour. A\u00a0House of Lords select committee report\u00a0has even cited the bandwagon effect as a reason for toughening up oversight over polling.\nIn truth, however, there is very little evidence that polls produce this kind of effect. A recent\u00a0large-scale study\u00a0spanning multiple countries found that those exposed to polls in simulated election campaigns were no more likely to support the leading party than those who received no polling information, reinforcing\u00a0decades of research\u00a0finding little-to-mixed evidence of bandwagon effects.\nThis lack of a bandwagon effect doesn\u2019t seem to be due to how much attention people are paying to polls. Voters tend to have a\u00a0good sense\u00a0of how parties are currently polling: most can accurately\u00a0identify who is in the lead, and many attribute that knowledge to the polls. So, by now, many British voters probably do know that Labour has a big polling lead, but that knowledge in itself is not likely to convince many of them to jump on the bandwagon.\nIn reality, Labour\u2019s lead in the polls is so large that it is unlikely any of these effects would make much of a difference to its chances of winning the election. While the polls do seem to influence the vote, they mostly just measure it.\nBut if Labour wants its lead to work in its favour, it should avoid relying on simplistic ideas about the bandwagon effect. To the extent that Labour\u2019s campaign incorporates its polling performance, it should carry on warning against complacency and doing everything it can to prevent the Conservatives from gaining any momentum \u2013 with a little help, perhaps, from Reform UK.\nThis article first appeared in 'The Conversation' on 12 June 2024.\n\n\n\n\nRelated items\n\n\n\n\n\n\n News story: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nQueen Mary academics recognised with prestigious Philip Leverhulme prizes for pioneering research\r\n\r\n  \n\n22 October 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n News story: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nEvidence tells us voters might be convinced to accept short-term pain for long-term gain \u2013 but it will be a hard sell\r\n\r\n  \n\n20 September 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n News story: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOpening the door to UK politics: How is practical work experience broadening access to political careers?\r\n\r\n  \n\n2 September 2024\n\n\n\n\nFor media information, contact:\nPress Officeemail: press@qmul.ac.uk\nCould Labour\u2019s massive poll lead affect, as well as reflect, how it performs at the election?

        "text": "Trump win could see mass purge of state department, US diplomats fear\nAmerica\u2019s career diplomats are braced for the threat of a mass purge if Donald Trump wins the November election and for the potential flooding of the state department with loyalty-tested political appointees.\n\nRather than leading to a seamless change of course in a rightward Trumpist direction, the diplomats\u2019 union and former ambassadors argue, such an attempted takeover would be much more likely to end in legal challenges, gridlock and chaos.\n\nIf elected, Trump has threatened to reinstate a policy he unsuccessfully attempted in his first term with the creation of \u201cSchedule F\u201d, a new category of federal employees which would be applied to tens of thousands of civil servants in \u201cpolicy-related\u201d jobs, robbing them of legal protections and making them liable to be fired at will.\n\nA rightwing Washington thinktank, the Heritage Foundation, has prepared a blueprint for a second Trump term called Project 2025, fleshing out the Schedule F approach with a chapter on plans for the state department, which puts an emphasis on a clean-out of career officials suspected of not being fully committed to the president\u2019s agenda, from the first day of a new Trump presidency, his inauguration.\n\n\u201cThe next administration must take swift and decisive steps to reforge the department into a lean and functional diplomatic machine that serves the president and thereby the American people,\u201d the 2025 plan declares. \u201cNo one in a leadership position on the morning of January 20 should hold that position at the end of the day.\u201d\n\nThe plan also envisages getting around the requirements of Senate confirmation of nominees for senior positions by the president simply placing his people in state department posts in an acting capacity pending confirmation, and thereby \u201cexert leverage on the Senate\u201d to accelerate the confirmation process.\n\nThe author of the chapter, Kiron Skinner, ran the state department\u2019s office of policy planning for about a year in the Trump administration. She depicted the department as a bastion of leftwing partisan resistance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that they\u2019re just left wing, it is what they really believe is so radically different,\u201d Skinner told the In the Room with Peter Bergen podcast this week. \u201cThey think they have a responsibility now to dig in and keep their point of view, or wait out the president by slowing the process down.\u201d\n\nWhen Bergen asked her if she could think of an instance in the Trump presidency when state department staff obstructed policy, she said she could not come up with a specific example.\n\n\u201cI think it was so multifaceted, so broad-based, it\u2019s hard to point at one,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I found is that there were a lot of junior staffers who were not there for the president\u2019s agenda because no one ever told them it was their job to be.\u201d\n\nDennis Jett, a former ambassador on the same podcast, said the plan sounded like \u201ca hostile takeover\u201d.\n\nThomas Shannon, who was undersecretary of state for political affairs under Trump, the third highest position at state, said the plan of mass replacement of state department staff with Trump loyalists was unlawful and unworkable.\n\n\u201cThese people are smoking some pretty serious weed. I\u2019d like to know where they get it,\u201d he said. \u201cKiron Skinner might think that she is landing the stormtroopers to take over the state department, and to be ready to respond to the president\u2019s orders, but actually what\u2019s going to happen is chaos, as people resist,\u201d said Shannon, who served as interim secretary of state in the first 12 days of the Trump presidency.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, Schedule F is almost certainly illegal and unconstitutional,\u201d he said. \u201cThe authority to establish the structures for the civil service, and to reform that service, lies in the Congress.\u201d\n\nShannon \u2013 who served six presidents in his career, four of them Republican \u2013 said that placing people in positions in large numbers in an acting capacity would enrage the Senate, making it much harder to work with Congress. He pointed out it would also take a substantial amount of time to security-vet the new arrivals, and meanwhile it would be illegal for junior staff to share sensitive material with them, putting the rank and file in an impossible situation.\n\nThe diplomats\u2019 union, the American Foreign Service Association (AFSA), has made clear it would fight any attempt to impose Schedule F.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably not lawful, because people do have protections,\u201d AFSA\u2019s president, Thomas Yazdgerdi, said. \u201cRemember, these are professional career foreign service members, who have devoted their lives to protecting our interests and promoting our values \u2013 and who serve in some of the most inhospitable and dangerous places on earth.\u201d\n\nYazdgerdi adamantly disputed Skinner\u2019s depiction of the state department as a partisan stronghold.\n\n\u201cI just couldn\u2019t buy her main contention, that there is this leftwing group of folks who will not carry out the foreign policy of a conservative president. It\u2019s just not true,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one is questioning that the foreign service needs to carry out the foreign policy of the president. We do that. We don\u2019t ask our members what party they are when they join AFSA. It\u2019s completely non-partisan.\u201d\n\nDaniel Fried, a former ambassador to Poland, said that all administrations come into office seeking to populate the state department with officials who share their political vision. The difference with Project 2025 and the Schedule F plan is the scale of the ambition. Some observers believe that up to 50,000 across the whole civil service could be axed after inauguration day, about 10 times the normal turnover. However, Fried suggested that some of Trump\u2019s incoming team might not object to the resulting confusion.\n\n\u201cA lot of the people in the Trump movement don\u2019t like the federal government anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cThey would want to paralyze it for ideological reasons, and that could do a lot of damage. It could be a real problem.\u201d",

        "text": "RFK Jr. offers foreign policy views on Ukraine, Israel, vows to halve military spending\nIndependent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. vowed Wednesday that if elected president, he'd slash the military budget by half.\n\n\"I will push for [a] 50% reduction in military expenditures in my first four years in office, with more cuts to come thereafter,\" Kennedy said. \"A way to keep the dollar strong is to keep the country strong. We can do that by redirecting our bloated military budget toward infrastructure, education and health and building our economy and building small business\"\n\nSpeaking the day before President Biden signed a security agreement with Ukraine, Kennedy told voters in Yorba Linda, Calif., that U.S. foreign policy has been based on the \"delusion\" that American intervention abroad will uphold democracy.\n\nCiting billion-dollar aid packages that have been approved for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan, Kennedy said he wants to roll back defense spending to the levels last seen under President Eisenhower. Seizing on the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, Eisenhower believed he had an opening to avert an arms war with Russia and thought dramatically cutting defense spending would aid the cause. He did avoid major conflicts, but the Cold War still intensified during his presidency.\n\nKennedy also faulted the U.S. for \u2014 in his view \u2014 escalating conflict abroad over the past few decades. He has previously said he does not support more military aid for Ukraine, though he stands by Israel, calling the Russia-Ukraine conflict a \"war of choice\" and the Israel-Hamas conflict a \"moral war.\"\n\n\"We created ISIS,\" Kennedy told voters Wednesday night, referring to the brutal terrorist group that grew out of the remnants of al Qaeda in Iraq and spread across the Middle East in 2014. \"We drove four million immigrants up into Europe and destabilized all the Western democracies of Europe for generations.\"\n\nKennedy suggested that the U.S. take a page out of China's book. He said the country has emerged as a world superpower by using its budget more effectively, investing in infrastructure and businesses in places like Africa and South America, rather than beefing up its military presence.\n\n\"They spent $8 trillion on bridges, roads, airports and schools and hospitals,\" Kennedy said. \"Our forever wars made us enemies across the globe \u2014 left us bankrupt at home. China's investments, in contrast, made friends across the globe and brought it influence in every corner of the Earth.\"\n\nWhere does Kennedy stand on Ukraine?\n\nKennedy has rejected any U.S. involvement in Ukraine, including sending military aid, and told reporters at a campaign rally on Long Island in late April that he blames Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for issuing a decree making it \"illegal in Ukraine to negotiate with President Putin.\"\n\n\"[Putin] does not know what dignity and honesty are. Therefore, we are ready for a dialogue with Russia, but with another president of Russia,\" Zelenskyy said in October 2022, after Putin annexed four Ukrainian territories, which world leaders condemned as an illegal land grab.\n\nIn an interview with Twins Pod in early April, Kennedy seemed to praise the Russian leader for what in his view were the Russian leader's pacifist intentions, \"Putin said, 'Look I don't want to go into Crimea. Let's negotiate a peace.'\"\n\nTwo years ago, Putin undertook an invasion of Ukraine to keep it from making common cause with western democracies, thereby posing a threat to his rule in Russia.\n\nKennedy has also repeated the Russian president's claims that he undertook the invasion to keep NATO out of Ukraine and \"de-Nazify\" the country.\n\nMr. Biden has likened Putin's invasion of Ukraine to Hitler's Nazi forces invading other European nations. On Thursday, the leaders of the Group of Seven nations agreed to provide Ukraine with a $50 billion loan amid the ongoing war.\n\nWhere does Kennedy stand on Israel?\n\nKennedy has been a staunch supporter of Israel, often telling reporters that he believes Israel has the right to defend itself against Hamas following the massacre that took place on Oct. 7, 2023. Though the U.S. and western powers have called for restraint from Israel when attacking the Gaza Strip, Kennedy told Reuters that a cease-fire would only allow Hamas to rearm.\n\nKennedy's running mate, Nicole Shanahan, said she disagrees with the independent candidate on this front. Israel's response to Hamas' attack is a topic that leads to \"heated debate\" between the two, Shanahan said during a podcast last week with host Glenn Greenwald.\n\n\"And what I see right now happening on the ground in Gaza, is devastating. I think that, you know, there's arguments to be made, that we're long past the point of a cease-fire,\" Shanahan said. \"I think there's lots of arguments to be made that Israel should be showing more restraint.\"",

        "text": "What are the investment implications of MORENA\u2019s landslide victory in the 2024 Mexican elections?\nIt is still unclear how closely Sheinbaum will follow in Lopez Obrador\u2019s footsteps. While some political analysts view Sheinbaum as a technocrat, she is also part of a left-leaning party with strong ideologies and aims to centralize power.\n\nMORENA party\u2019s candidate, Claudia Sheinbaum, won the Mexican presidential election with a historic margin, receiving 60% of votes. This victory was anticipated, but the scale of left-leaning MORENA's win in Congress was unexpected. The ruling party and its allies achieved a qualified majority in the Chamber of Deputies but not the Senate, falling just short of the two-thirds majority needed in both houses to allow them to enact constitutional changes without opposition support.\n\nWhile policy continuity is still expected, this landslide victory by Morena could lead to increased policy and reform risks at a time when Mexico is currently a focal point for \u201cnearshoring\u201d \u2014a trend that has positioned Mexico as a strategic manufacturing hub for companies diversifying their supply chains. The wider-than-expected margin could make it easier for MORENA to implement more aggressive spending plans and pursue outgoing President Andr\u00e9s Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO)\u2019s 20-point reform agenda presented in February 2024, which includes increasing access to education and healthcare, increasing minimum wages and potentially reversing the previous pension system reform. Some market participants are also concerned that a potential reform of the Judicial system could weaken the institution\u2019s independence and judicial power. Sheinbaum has highlighted this will be one of her administration\u2019s first priorities.\n\nIt is still unclear how closely Sheinbaum will follow in Lopez Obrador\u2019s footsteps. While some political analysts view Sheinbaum as a technocrat, she is also part of a left-leaning party with strong ideologies and aims to centralize power. At the same time, she faces significant external pressure to keep the fiscal balance in check, boost trade and investment, and reduce violence.\n\nLooking ahead, U.S. investors should monitor several key challenges ahead for the new administration in Mexico. The upcoming review of the USMCA in the second half of 2026 will be crucial for understanding the future of trade relations and regulatory frameworks affecting multinational companies in Mexico. Additionally, the ability of Sheinbaum\u2019s administration to enhance infrastructure and strengthen the rule of law will be critical for attracting firms looking to relocate production to Mexico. Moreover, the rhetoric of U.S. candidates in the upcoming U.S. election, especially regarding potential tariffs and migration policies, could impact bilateral relations and economic policies, influencing the investment climate in Mexico.\n\nThe immediate market reaction to the election results was negative, with the Mexican peso depreciating over 4% the day following the quick vote release. Despite the MXN being one of the strongest performing major currencies again this year, supported by high real interest rates and robust inflows from remittances and tourism, the election outcome introduces new uncertainties that could lead to further volatility. In the short-term, jitters in Mexican equities and bonds could persist as investors continue to digest the potential for non-market friendly reforms, especially given that Mexican assets had become a consensus overweight. Longer term, \u201cnearshoring\u201d is a key tailwind for Mexico\u2019s economy and markets, but exactly how much it captures of this potential remains to be seen.",

        "text": "Bitcoin miners at Donald Trump's closed-door event say he thinks bitcoin can help win AI arms race\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump speaks at a dinner at Mar-a-Lago on June 5, 2024 in West Palm Beach, Florida. Now that his criminal trial in New York has wrapped up, the former president has scheduled a number of fundraising events around the country to aid his presidential bid. (Photo by Eva Marie Uzcategui/Getty Images) Eva Marie Uzcategui | Getty Images\n\nThis past Tuesday night in Palm Beach, Florida, about a dozen bitcoin mining executives and experts sat down with former president Donald Trump for an hour and a half in a small tea room at the Mar-a-Lago Club. As a steady drizzle fell outside, they sipped from Trump-branded water bottles and tried to sell him on the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The meeting marked the first time the former president and presumptive Republican presidential nominee \u2014 recently convicted of 34 felonies in New York \u2014 had taken a meeting with the technologists securing the $1.3 trillion bitcoin network. The intimate gathering brought together a coalition of some of the biggest private and public American miners in the business, including representatives from Riot Platforms , Marathon Digital Holdings , Terawulf , CleanSpark , Core Scientific , Arkon Energy, Cholla Energy and Exacore. CNBC spoke to half the miners who attended the closed door session on Tuesday, including the CEO of Riot Platforms. Jason Les told CNBC that one of the group's top talking points was the fact that the U.S. is number one in a lot of things, and it should be number one at bitcoin, especially as the world's top coin touches new all-time price highs this year. Bitcoin is up 160% to around $67,000 since June 2023. Senator Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) \u2014 who is the ranking member on the Senate's Banking Committee and Finance Subcommittee, as well as a vocal proponent of the digital asset industry broadly, and bitcoin mining in particular \u2014 was also there to help guide what participants described as a free-flowing and wide-ranging discussion on bitcoin, energy, job creation and the push to beat China in the artificial intelligence arms race. Many agreed that the former president was collaborative, had well-informed questions and seemed genuinely interested in how bitcoin miners could help solve America's energy deficit problem. BTC Inc. CEO David Bailey, who organized the mining sit-down with Trump, says that the meeting is part of a larger push to support the former president's bid to return to the White House. \"Our industry intends to make bitcoin and crypto a defining issue for the 2024 election,\" Bailey said of the effort. \"As an industry we are committed to raising over $100 million and turning out more than 5,000,000 voters for the Trump reelection effort.\" Less than four hours after Trump's roundtable wrapped, the former president took to social media to extol the virtues of the bitcoin mining business. \"Bitcoin mining may be our last line of defense against a CBDC,\" Trump posted shortly before midnight on Tuesday. \"Biden's hatred of Bitcoin only helps China, Russia, and the Radical Communist Left. We want all the remaining Bitcoin to be MADE IN THE USA!!! It will help us be ENERGY DOMINANT!!!\"\n\nwatch now\n\nBitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies are created through a process known as proof-of-work, in which miners around the world run high-powered computers that collectively validate transactions and simultaneously create new tokens. The process requires heaps of electricity, leading miners to seek out the cheapest sources of power. Many have begun to set up shop in the U.S. in the last few years, much to the chagrin of a mix of mostly Democratic lawmakers, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). \"It's such an easy issue for politicians,\" in part because there is \"no major ask that we have to change the rules or anything else,\" Les, who runs a bitcoin mining company with a market cap of about $3 billion, told CNBC. \"We just want to be treated like everyone else,\" Les added, noting that more than one in four people in the U.S. now owns bitcoin, according to a survey recently conducted by bitcoin financial services firm Unchained.\n\nwatch now\n\nBitcoin that's \"made in America\"\n\nFor months, Trump \u2014 who recently launched his latest non-fungible token collection on the solana blockchain in April \u2014 has been making increasingly bullish comments on crypto. He is now accepting digital currency donations and has pledged to defend the rights of those who choose to self-custody their coins, meaning that they don't rely on a centralized entity like Coinbase to hold their tokens and instead, do it themselves in personal crypto wallets, which are sometimes outside the reach of the Internal Revenue Service. Trump also vowed at the Libertarian National Convention in Washington in May to keep Sen. Warren and \"her goons\" away from bitcoin holders. In early June in San Francisco, technologists, crypto executives, and venture capitalists paid up to $300,000 per ticket to join a Trump fundraiser that ultimately raised more than $12 million. And then on Tuesday, Trump declared that all future bitcoin will be minted in the U.S., should he return to the White House. Geoff Kendrick, who heads up digital assets research at Standard Chartered, recently wrote that he expects bitcoin to reach the $100,000 price threshold as the U.S. approaches the November presidential election and $150,000 by the end of the year if Trump wins.\n\nDecentralization is a key feature of bitcoin, because it means the network isn't controlled by any entity and can't be shut down \u2014 even if a government disapproves. Roughly 37% of the bitcoin network's miners are located in the U.S., with China closely following at 21% of bitcoin's global processing power despite Beijing banning the practice in 2021. \"He wants to keep all of the remaining bitcoin mining in the U.S. and out of China,\" Matthew Schultz, CleanSpark's executive chairman and director, who attended the Mar-a-Lago working group, told CNBC. \"For him to be legitimately engaged in the bitcoin industry, and understanding the way that mining works, was really awesome.\" The group also touched on doing more to support U.S.-made ASICs, short for Application-Specific Integrated Circuits, which are the purpose-built rigs used to mine bitcoin. Most ASICs are built in China, but Auradine is a U.S.-based startup that is manufacturing this equipment. Jayson Browder, senior vice president of Government Affairs at Marathon Digital Holdings, said that he brought one of these machines to show Trump to highlight the significance of \"bringing chips manufacturing back to the U.S.\" The emphasis on protectionist policies that safeguard domestic manufacturing echoes the former president's \"America First\" economic agenda.\n\nwatch now\n\nTrump also expressed concern over the U.S. launching a central bank digital currency, or CBDC \u2014 that is, a digital coin issued by the Federal Reserve that could grant the government greater access to personal spending data. Bitcoin is seen by many in the industry as the antithesis of a CBDC because it is a censorship-resistant and borderless currency that is not centrally issued, nor constrained by geographic or governmental boundaries. Trump wrote that bitcoin mining may be the \"last line of defense against a CBDC.\" When asked about the Tuesday evening meeting, Brian Hughes, senior advisor to the Trump administration, told CNBC that \"crypto innovators and others in the technology sector are under attack from Biden and Democrats\" and that \"while Biden stifles innovation with more regulation and higher taxes, President Trump is ready to encourage American leadership in this and other emerging technologies.\" Trump's pro-crypto campaign platform comes as polling data shows that crypto matters more to the voting public now than in past presidential elections. A Harris poll funded by the spot bitcoin ETF issuer Grayscale found that one in three U.S. voters will consider a candidate's crypto stance before casting a ballot. Bitcoin has also seen its place as an asset class solidified in the traditional financial markets through the adoption of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Since launching in January in the U.S., these funds have collectively brought in roughly $60 billion in assets under management as institutions and an entirely new set of investors gain exposure to the digital asset class for the first time. So far this year, crypto-friendly venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz; centralized crypto exchange Coinbase; veteran venture capitalist Ron Conway; venture capital executive Fred Wilson; tech executives Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss; and Ripple, a crypto solutions business, have all donated tens of millions of dollars to Fairshake, according to the pro-crypto super PAC. Meanwhile, bitcoin miners who met with Trump this week tell CNBC they have been trying and failing for years to get into a room with President Biden. Under the current administration, the U.S. Treasury Department has looked to impose a 30% tax squarely on the cost of electricity used in crypto-related mining operations. Multiple attendees described the unfettered access to the presumptive Republican nominee to be a welcome change from the status quo. CNBC reached out to the White House to ask about the administration's perceived reluctance to engage with bitcoin miners but did not immediately hear back. \"He walked around and shook hands with everyone in the room, talked about where they're from, and thanked us for being there,\" Schultz said of Trump's demeanor during the meeting on Tuesday night, adding, \"He's smart as a whip. Not one note for that entire interaction.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nTuesday night at Mar-a-Lago\n\nIt was a no comms and no photographer policy at the mining roundtable on Tuesday. Attendees, who had an expansive view over thunderstorms on the Atlantic coast that night, forfeited their smartphones to a Radio Frequency Identification pouch that blocked incoming and outgoing signals. As participants lost their sense of time, they convened under a large chandelier listening to the former president actively engage on the nuances of America's energy deficit, bitcoin mining, and AI \u2014 without the aid of a teleprompter \u2014 for the duration of the conversation. \"He just really knew his stuff,\" said Browder of Marathon. \"We were very impressed by how in the weeds he was on some pretty dense topics when you're talking about artificial intelligence, data centers, energy buildout, and transmission,\" continued Browder, who added that it was the first time bitcoin miners have formally met with the former president to discuss the industry. CNBC spoke to half a dozen miners who were at the meeting, all of whom converged on the same conclusion; that Trump understood how bitcoin mining complements some of the bigger macro challenges that the U.S. has as a country, most notably the imminent need for the rapid buildout of energy production and transmission infrastructure amid the booming interest in generative AI technologies.\n\nwatch now\n\nSchultz of the NASDAQ-traded mining firm CleanSpark said Trump came in, sat down, and got right down to business after grabbing a Diet Coke and a cookie from the four-plate spread of macadamia, chocolate chip, and oatmeal varieties adorning the table. Trump \"actually believes that bitcoin provides value,\" said CleanSpark's executive chairman. \"I went there feeling like this is going to be a campaign rally; a highly politicized campaign rally.\" \"It was anything but a fundraiser pitch,\" continued Schultz. Exacore president Chris Cook echoed that takeaway, telling CNBC that Trump was \"very knowledgeable on the subject\" of bitcoin mining and that he understood the significance of the job creation that could come from supporting big data mining in the U.S. \"We're able to train people that have been displaced from industries that may have evolved or no longer exist \u2014 and train them to operate and work in a bitcoin mine,\" said Cook. \"The coal industry, for example. There's not nearly as many jobs there anymore, and we can teach them to operate a bitcoin mine.\" Amanda Fabiano, a veteran of the mining industry who is on the board of a publicly traded mining firm and the founder of Fabiano Consulting, came away with a similar impression. She says that the former president seemed especially interested in hearing more about the substantial job creation that the mining industry generates in remote parts of the country in sectors ranging from technology to construction, as well as the financial incentive it provides for the buildout of infrastructure to harness the power of stranded renewable energy sources. Marathon's Browder says that a lot of the places where they mine bitcoin are in rural areas of the United States that have been left behind, whether it was a town once known for its coal plants, or factories that have shuttered altogether. \"We've come in and revitalized those areas, and I think that resonates very well with former President Trump, his team, and obviously, a lot of voters in rural America that support him,\" said Browder. Exacore's Cook says the kind of job creation they're talking about extends well beyond staffing a mine. The mining industry justifies the economic investment to create new power generation infrastructure, which then creates the need for thousands of new roles to make that buildout happen. \"That's where you've got all these ancillary jobs; it's not just the bitcoin mining directly,\" said Cook. \"I think we can about double the amount of power generation in the U.S., which would, by my estimate, add two to three percent to GDP and create close to a million jobs,\" continued Cook.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"He's been speaking more about energy independence, jobs, and technology,\" Marathon Digital's Browder said of Trump. \"I think it's the broader context of what's happening around the world with the power competition between the U.S. and China.\" Across the U.S. are untapped and stranded sources of renewable energy. In West Texas, for example, there is an idyllic overlap of sun quality and wind speed. But a lot of that renewable energy is concentrated in remote parts of the state, and without a financial incentive, there is little reason to build out renewable infrastructure to harness this energy. Enter bitcoin miners. Some have opted to build mining sites where wind and solar are abundant and the transmission system is constrained, meaning that power wants to flow down the line, but the lines are full. These mines act like a large power station but in reverse. The mines will absorb abundant renewable energy at times when supply outpaces demand, thereby monetizing these assets when there are no other buyers. And on the flip side, the mines will incrementally ramp down their energy intake, as demand on the grid rises. Adding bitcoin miners to the portfolio of energy buyers has helped to improve the core economics of renewable power production. Providing demand to these semi-stranded assets essentially makes renewables economically viable when they might not be otherwise. Schultz noted, however, that Trump isn't a huge fan of wind energy, because it's too expensive to build, maintain, and dispose of when the components go bad, so he doesn't see it as a long-term solution, but he is apparently a fan of renewables otherwise. \"It's a race against the rest of the world building this infrastructure, so we don't want the United States to be left behind in this regard,\" added Riot's Les.\n\nwatch now\n\nAI meets bitcoin mining",

        "text": "Have we reached peak yoga in the U.S.? The CDC wants to know\nHave we reached peak yoga in the U.S.? The CDC wants to know\n\ntoggle caption Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nIn the U.S., about 1 out of 6 adults say they practice yoga, according to new survey data published Wednesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAbout 80% are practicing to improve their health, and some 30% are using it to treat and manage pain.\n\n\u201cYoga is a complementary health approach used to promote health and well-being,\u201d says Nazik Elgaddal, an IT specialist at the CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics who co-authored a data brief on the topic.\u201d The stretching and strengthening exercise has been shown to reduce stress and help with some types of neck and back pain.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe survey also found that women are twice as likely to do yoga than men \u2013 with more than 23% of U.S. women practicing it. Yoga is most popular among people who are Asian or White, though there are plenty of people who are Black, Hispanic or of other races doing yoga too. People with higher incomes were more likely to do yoga.\n\nThe survey did not distinguish between yoga done in person or online, notes Elgaddal, who takes yoga classes offered by her workplace on Zoom. It found that more than half of the respondents also meditate as a part of their practice.\n\nThe data comes from the 2022 National Health Interview Survey, and is published in a June 2024 data brief. Every five years, the NHIS includes questions on complementary health, including yoga.\n\nA previous analysis showed that complementary approaches in the U.S. have grown in popularity over the past twenty years. Yoga experienced the largest increase in that time, going from being practiced by 5% of the adult population in 2002 to 16% in 2022.\n\nIn that time, yoga has become so ubiquitous that it\u2019s hard to parse, says Ophelia Yeung, a senior research fellow at the Global Wellness Institute, which studies the economics of the $5.6 trillion global wellness industry. \u201cThere are lots of people doing [yoga] on different online platforms \u2013 Peloton, Apple Fitness, Netflix, Youtube\u201d to name a few, Yeung says, \u201cIf you ask a consumer which part of their [subscription] spending is for fitness and which part is for entertainment, it\u2019s all bundled,\u201d she says.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIt has also become more accessible over time, Yeung says, noting that there's now versions adapted for back injury, for inflexibility, for practicing with goats and dogs. There are also yoga classes designed to be welcoming for larger bodies, for those with disabilities and for populations such as school kids and veterans.\n\nYoga\u2019s mainstream popularity has spawned yoga-influenced offshoots, such as mobility workouts and mindfulness, which are so evolved from its roots that the people who practice them may not realize they are related, says Rebecca D\u2019Orsogna, a high school social studies teacher in New York who wrote a doctoral dissertation on the history of yoga in the U.S.\n\n\u201cParts of the yoga practice are taken out of the context of yoga and put somewhere else\u2026to the point where people are almost unwittingly doing it,\u201d she says.\n\nD\u2019Orsogna traces the current yoga wave to the late 1960\u2019s, when The Beatles brought an explosion of interest to the work of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and his Transcendental Meditation after a trip to India.\n\n\u201c[Western adopters] considered it to be \u2018more authentic\u2019 yoga because it is connected directly to India, as opposed to what had been cobbled together within the United States [before that],\u201d she says, noting a periodic cropping up of interest in yoga in U.S. pop culture that stretches back to the naturalist philosophers of the 1800\u2019s.\n\nThat thread of interest waxed with the new age movement in the 1970\u2019s, and waned with the aerobics fitness trend in the 80\u2019s, but it\u2019s since gained a firm foothold in U.S. mainstream culture, D\u2019Orsogna says. She says the practice is linked with women\u2019s empowerment and self-actualization. \u201cThe overarching history of yoga in the United States is that people who popularize it use it for whatever the cultural moment calls for,\u201d she says.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nYoga has become big business \u2013 the largest contributor to the \u201cmindful movement\u201d market, which also includes practices such as pilates and tai chi, worth $12.7 billion in the U.S. in 2022, according to data from the Global Wellness Institute. Mindful movement soared in popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic \u2013 spending increased by 17% from 2019 to 2022 on things like classes, equipment and retreats \u2013 as people looked to it as a way to maintain fitness and alleviate stress, says Yeung.\n\nStill, the benefits of yoga \u2013 stress relief, pain relief and cultivating a connection between the mind and the body \u2013 can be obtained for little to no money, Yeung says.\n\n\u201cThere are tons of free opportunities online and in communities,\u201d she says, such as videos on Youtube that offer high quality instruction. At its core, practicing yoga postures requires a clear surface and a willingness to stretch.\n\n",

        "text": "Biden, Trump are least-liked pair of major party presidential candidates in at least 3 decades\nThe White House is seen on June 24, 2023, in Washington. (Samuel Corum/Getty Images)\n\nWith the 2024 U.S. presidential election about five months away, a quarter of Americans hold unfavorable views of both major party candidates \u2013 President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump. This is according to a Pew Research Center survey of 8,638 adults conducted May 13-19.\n\nHow we did this We conducted this analysis to explore how Americans\u2019 views of the 2024 major party presidential candidates compare to views of past candidates. Candidate favorability ratings are based on Pew Research Center surveys and the archives of the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research, using surveys conducted in May or June of each election year. The 2024 data in this analysis is based on a survey of 8,638 adults conducted from May 13 to 19, 2024. The survey was conducted on the Center\u2019s nationally representative American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Here are the questions used for this analysis, along with responses.\n\nThat is the highest share expressing negative views of both candidates in surveys conducted at about this point in the election cycle by the Center and other organizations dating back to the 1988 election. And it\u2019s nearly twice as high as four years ago, when 13% of Americans expressed unfavorable opinions of both Biden and Trump.\n\n(The 2024 Center survey was conducted before Trump\u2019s conviction on 34 criminal counts in the New York \u201chush money\u201d case on May 30.)\n\nThe previous high point for negative views of both presidential candidates was in 2016. At about this point in the 2016 campaign, 20% of Americans expressed unfavorable opinions about both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.\n\nPrior to 2016, no more than about one-in-ten Americans had held unfavorable opinions of both major party candidates at this stage of any of the seven previous presidential campaigns. And during several campaigns \u2013 most recently George W. Bush versus John Kerry in 2004 \u2013 no more than about 5% did.\n\nIn the current campaign:\n\nSlightly more than a third of Americans (36%) have a favorable view of Trump and an unfavorable opinion of Biden.\n\nNearly as many (34%) have a favorable view of Biden and a negative one of Trump.\n\n25% have unfavorable views of both candidates, while just 3% feel favorably toward both.\n\nAmericans\u2019 opinions of Biden and Trump are largely unchanged since March.\n\nAccording to the 2024 survey, 39% of Americans view Trump favorably, while 37% have a positive opinion of Biden. Trump\u2019s ratings are roughly the same as they were at about the same point in 2016 (37% favorable) but lower than in 2020 (42%). Biden\u2019s ratings are lower than they were at this point in 2020 (46% favorable).\n\nOverall, the favorability ratings for major party presidential candidates during the past three elections have been lower than in prior elections.\n\nAt this point in the last three election cycles, each of the major party candidates \u2013 Clinton and Trump in 2016, and Biden and Trump in 2020 and 2024 \u2013 have had favorable ratings below 50%.\n\nIn contrast, in every election between 1988 and 2012, at least one candidate had a favorable rating of at least 50% at about this point. In 2004 and earlier, both candidates had ratings of at least 50%.\n\nThree candidates during this period had favorable ratings at or above 60%: Michael Dukakis in 1988, Bill Clinton in 1996 and George W. Bush in 2000. Clinton\u2019s and Bush\u2019s ratings remained at about that level for the remainder of the campaign, while ratings for Dukakis declined.\n\nIncreasing negative partisanship is a major factor behind the decline in favorability of major party candidates.\n\nIn that regard, the pattern is similar to the growing partisanship in presidential job approval ratings.\n\nFavorability ratings for candidates have become considerably more negative among members of the opposing party than they were a few decades ago.\n\nJust 8% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents have a favorable opinion of Trump. A similar share of Republicans and Republican leaners (6%) feel positively toward Biden.\n\nIn contrast, as recently as 2008, 27% of Democrats viewed Republican candidate John McCain favorably while an identical share of Republicans had a favorable opinion of Democratic candidate Barack Obama.\n\nFavorability of leaders in both parties\n\nAmericans\u2019 negative evaluations of political leaders also extend to the leadership of both chambers of Congress and the vice president.\n\nSix-in-ten hold unfavorable views of Vice President Kamala Harris, while 36% rate her favorably. Another 3% say they have not heard of her. These ratings are essentially unchanged since July 2023.\n\nAmericans are much more likely not to have heard of Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson (37%) or Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (25%).\n\nStill, those who have heard of them view both congressional leaders more unfavorably than favorably. Schumer\u2019s rating is largely unchanged in recent years. This is the first time the Center has asked about Johnson.\n\nNote: Here are the questions used for this analysis, along with responses.",

        "text": "US vice presidential candidates: Everything you need to know\nAl Jazeera looks at the VP position in the US, how candidates are chosen and their role in elections and governance.\n\nWashington, DC \u2013 The vice presidency in the United States does not come with much power, yet the names of vice presidential nominees appear on the ballot, yard signs and campaign merchandise next to the main candidates for president.\n\nVice presidents can play an outsized role in the White House beyond the narrow authorities granted by the US Constitution. And as candidates, they can help carry the message of their campaign and boost it.\n\nThis year, President Joe Biden is expected to stick with Vice President Kamala Harris as his running mate. Former President Donald Trump is set to announce his VP pick during or shortly before the Republican National Convention next month.\n\nThe VP is elected as part of the presidential ticket. So, if people vote for Biden\u2019s re-election as president, they indirectly elect Harris for another four-year term as VP.\n\nAs the campaign season heats up, Al Jazeera looks at the VP position in the US and how vice presidential nominees are chosen.\n\nWhat is the vice president\u2019s role in the constitution?\n\nChristopher Devine, a political science professor at the University of Dayton who has written two books about vice presidential candidates, said the VP has a \u201cvery limited set of responsibilities\u201d according to the constitution.\n\n\u201cThe VP takes over for the president if something happens \u2013 death, resignation or even in case of temporary incapacity. That\u2019s the big one,\u201d Devine told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe vice president also casts the tie-breaking vote in the Senate \u2013 something that Harris did regularly in the first two years of Biden\u2019s presidency when the chamber was split 50-50 between Republicans and Democrats.\n\nThe vice president is also the president of the Senate, but VPs have largely stopped presiding over legislative proceedings \u2013 a mostly ceremonial role \u2013 in past decades.\n\nWhat does the VP do beyond official duties?\n\nNowadays vice presidents act as presidential advisers. They are expected to be the \u201clast person in the room\u201d before the president makes major decisions, Devine said.\n\n\u201cThey also play other roles, like being a liaison to Congress, helping to negotiate on legislative matters,\u201d he told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cOf course, they have some role in foreign policy \u2013 meeting with foreign heads of states or doing diplomatic missions, attending funerals and the like. So there\u2019s lots that vice presidents do. But most of what they do is not required by the constitution.\u201d\n\nWho defines the role of the VP?\n\nModern US history has seen powerful vice presidents \u2013 like Dick Cheney, especially during George W Bush\u2019s first term \u2013 as well as ones who had a low profile and were not seen as pivotal to their administration, such as Mike Pence, Trump\u2019s former VP.\n\nDevine said the president ultimately shapes the role of the vice president.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really up to the individual presidents. So vice presidents can be used as a great asset to advise the president on important matters. They could also be pushed to the side,\u201d he told Al Jazeera.\n\nLindsay Chervinsky, a presidential historian, said another factor that determines vice presidents\u2019 level of influence is their own experience and relationships.\n\nFor example, Cheney had served as a defence secretary, congressman and White House chief of staff.\n\n\u201cThey need to have something that they can bring to the table in a way that allows them to call on their expertise and connections in order to make an impact,\u201d Chervinsky said of vice presidents.\n\nUnlike candidates for president, VP candidates do not run in party primaries. They are chosen after the presidential nominee is determined.\n\nPresidential candidates pick their own running mates who then get the official nomination during their party\u2019s convention.\n\nDevine said candidates usually start with a long list of candidates and then start narrowing it down after rounds of interviews and background checks.\n\n\u201cThe vetting process is incredibly invasive because they\u2019re trying to find out if there are any skeletons in the closet that could come out about the vice presidential candidate during the campaign,\u201d Devine said.\n\n\u201cSo they ask for tax records, medical records, they do interviews with people who have worked with the candidates, with family members. They want to know everything.\u201d\n\nChervinsky said candidates typically want their VP pick to be a good public speaker to advance the campaign\u2019s message; being an \u201cattack dog\u201d who can effectively rebuke opponents also helps.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re also usually looking for someone who is different from them in some way,\u201d Chervinsky added.\n\nThe considerations could include race, age, gender and experience, to help with so-called ticket-balancing, which is meant to broaden the appeal of the campaign.\n\nFor example, Biden picked Harris \u2013 a Black woman who is considerably younger than him. Barack Obama, a first-term senator at the time, chose Biden, who had been in the Senate for 35 years.\n\nDevine said beyond electoral politics, candidates also look for a capable governing partner.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re looking at who can help win the election, but they\u2019re also looking at long term who can help govern once in office,\u201d he said.\n\nDo VP picks matter in elections?\n\nBoth Devine and Chervinsky said VP nominees do not make or break campaigns.\n\n\u201cTo the extent they matter, it\u2019s by influencing how people see the presidential candidates\u2019 judgement,\u201d said Devine. \u201cDo they make responsible decisions or not?\u201d\n\nWhat about Trump\u2019s VP pick?\n\nTrump had fallen out with his former VP after Pence refused to use his ceremonial role of counting the electoral college votes in Congress to reverse Biden\u2019s victory.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that Trump is looking for someone who is loyal to him above all other things, including the constitution,\u201d Chervinsky said.\n\nShe added that he may choose a woman or a person of colour as his running mate to appeal to those subsets of voters.\n\nTrump\u2019s rumoured VP picks include Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, Senator Tim Scott, Senator JD Vance and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum. Scott is the only Black Republican in the US Senate.\n\n\u201cIdeally, he should be looking for someone who could be the responsible governing party partner, but I don\u2019t really think that\u2019s generally how his considerations are made,\u201d Chervinsky said of Trump.",

        "text": "A second Trump term would double down on erasing trans rights. Here\u2019s how advocates are preparing.\nLGBTQ+ advocates are gearing up for a possible second Trump administration by planning future litigation, deepening relationships in Congress and mobilizing voters.\n\nIf former president Donald Trump is re-elected, advocacy groups expect him to enact anti-LGBTQ+ policies that are more far-reaching and extreme than those he put in place during his first term \u2014 based on his campaign promises and policies suggested by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that has shaped the GOP\u2019s agenda for decades.\n\nTrump is focused specifically on rolling back transgender rights, as he detailed in a campaign video last year. His proposals would terminate Medicare and Medicaid funding for hospitals that provide gender-affirming care to trans youth, attempt to charge teachers with sex discrimination for affirming students\u2019 gender identities and order federal agencies to \u201ccease all programs that promote the concept of sex and gender transition at any age.\u201d Trump also pledged to ask Congress to halt the use of federal funds to promote or pay for gender-affirming care, without distinguishing between care for adults or minors.\n\nSome of these policies mimic state anti-LGBTQ+ laws, which frequently run into enforcement issues as state agencies tasked with monitoring school bathrooms and classrooms are unable to find consistent ways to carry out restrictive laws. Several of Trump\u2019s proposed anti-trans policies would also require congressional approval. However, as a new report from the American Civil Liberties Union details, even if Trump gains the presidency without Republicans taking power in Congress, he would be able to take action against LGBTQ+ rights on his own \u2014 and has said that he plans to.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen over the last several years a militant effort in red states by the government to discriminate against trans folks, in particular, and the broader LGBTQ community, and even to go so far as to try to deny trans people\u2019s existence,\u201d said Mike Zamore, national director of policy and governmental affairs at the ACLU. \u201cThe danger in the Trump administration is seeing the federal government using its massive reach and resources to do something similar on a national scale.\u201d\n\nThe federal government could use its civil rights enforcement capabilities to argue that institutions trying to protect LGBTQ+ rights are violating the rights of people with certain religious beliefs, Zamore said, or it could threaten to withhold funding from universities that receive federal money if they do not discriminate against transgender students.\n\nIn the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Project 2025, a purported roadmap of executive actions that a future Republican president could take on various issues \u2014 including abortion access \u2014 several of the policy suggestions align with Trump\u2019s promises to roll back LGBTQ+ rights. Project 2025 advocates for the deletion of the terms \u201csexual orientation and gender identity\u201d from all federal rules and for prohibiting teachers from affirming trans students.\n\nOne of the more extreme proposals in Project 2025 equates the act of being transgender, or \u201ctransgender ideology,\u201d to pornography, and declares that it should be outlawed. The conservative think tank recommends that educators and public librarians who spread the concept of being transgender should be registered as sex offenders, and that telecommunications and technology firms that facilitate the spread of ideas about transgender people should be shuttered.\n\nThe ACLU says that a second Trump administration would not be able to implement such a policy without Congress \u2014 and that if such a policy did go into effect, using criminal laws to outlaw the concept of being transgender would violate the First Amendment.\n\nOverall, the ACLU expects the federal government under a second Trump presidency to rescind federal regulations that prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, and to weaponize federal law against transgender people in ways that would also harm cisgender and gender-nonconforming people, by attempting to enforce strict definitions of gender expression.\n\n\u201cThis election has huge ramifications for the future of trans rights across the country,\u201d said Josie Caballero, director of voting and elections at Advocates for Trans Equality. \u201cThe future is going to be incredibly difficult if we allow for a second Trump presidency. That will have ramifications that will affect the trans community for decades,\u201d she said.\n\nCaballero, a Texas-born granddaughter of Mexican immigrants who is also a military veteran and a queer trans woman, joined other advocates in Congress this week to lobby lawmakers in support of trans rights. If Trump is elected to another term, she believes that deepening relationships in Congress will help. But her focus ahead of the 2024 presidential election is getting as many trans people registered to vote, and ready to vote, as possible.\n\nBuilding a substantial trans voting bloc is crucial to demonstrate to lawmakers that trans people are a formidable political force, she said; and it provides a concrete way to show how many trans people are getting involved in the political process.\n\n\u201cIf you vote against trans issues, well you\u2019re going to lose a massive amount of votes and have those votes go against you,\u201d she said.\n\nCaius Willingham, senior policy advocate at Advocates for Trans Equality, led the organizing for the group\u2019s lobbying on Capitol Hill. Building strong relationships with lawmakers in Congress is key to a unified strategy to fight back against anti-trans attacks expected during a potential Trump 2025 administration, he said. When Congress is functioning properly, it is meant to check presidential overreach \u2014 and much of Project 2025 focuses on consolidating presidential power, he said. Project 2025 includes authors from Trump\u2019s former administration and campaign.\n\n\u201cTheir aim is to consolidate as much power in the White House as possible, and so it\u2019s very key to make sure that Congress remains a vital check. So that\u2019s why this is a huge priority for Advocates for Trans Equality,\u201d he said. There are strong allies for trans rights in Congress, he said \u2014 like Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington, author of a congressional bill that aims to recognize federal protections for transgender Americans.\n\nCaballero met on Wednesday with staff from Massachusetts Democrats in Congress, including Reps. Ayanna Pressley and Katherine Clark and Sens. Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren. Other staff at Advocates for Trans Equality, as well as the constituents that they brought to meet lawmakers, also met with Republicans in Congress.\n\n\u201cWe actually ended up with more than 90 meetings scheduled, and these meetings really ranged the political spectrum. We did not turn down a meeting with a single office,\u201d Willingham said. \u201cWe met with Ted Cruz\u2019s office. We scheduled something with Mitch McConnell\u2019s office, that one fell through. But we were here and we were happy to meet with anybody who would make the time to listen to us.\u201d\n\nWhether congressional Republicans have been responsive to those meetings remains to be seen. Within the past few years, anti-trans rhetoric and attempted policymaking have only continued to grow on Capitol Hill. But the rising number of federal anti-trans bills introduced by Republicans in Congress have been unable to pass, due to a Democratic-controlled Senate. In November, that could change.\n\nIf \u201ca pro-equality opposition\u201d controls either or both chambers of Congress in a second Trump administration, pro-LGBTQ+ members of Congress could still use the appropriations process to hinder Trump\u2019s ability to enact anti-trans laws, the ACLU writes in its report. The appropriations process refers to how the House and Senate fund the federal government, which is often derailed by \u201criders\u201d \u2014 provisions that dictate policy not directly related to the federal budget.\n\nSince many of the anti-LGBTQ+ policies proposed by Trump\u2019s campaign or Project 2025 would violate the Constitution and federal law, the ACLU says that litigation would be a significant part of its response to a second Trump term. As the last few years have seen a dramatic increase of anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric and laws, the civil rights group has mounted dozens of consequential lawsuits against those policies \u2014 and at least a dozen on health care bans within the last year. During Trump\u2019s first term, the ACLU took on the former president\u2019s order to ban trans people from the military amid hundreds of other lawsuits against the former administration.\n\nAlthough the ACLU is confident in its ability to fight anti-LGBTQ+ policies in court, and several judges appointed by Trump have actually granted wins for LGBTQ+ advocates, the organization says that the political atmosphere has still changed since Trump\u2019s first term.\n\n\u201cGetting courts to understand the experience of transgender people and the impact of discriminatory policies on their lives was difficult even before Trump reshaped the judiciary. It is that much harder now,\u201d the report reads. It was co-authored by Ian Thompson, senior legislative advocate at the ACLU, as well as James Esseks, attorney and project director for the ACLU\u2019s LGBTQ+ HIV Project, and Leslie Cooper, deputy director of the ACLU LGBT & HIV Project.\n\n\u201cWhat we know is that the courts are not as friendly as they once were,\u201d said Zamore, who contributed to the report. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us can assume that a position that was successful in the first Trump administration would necessarily prevail this go around, but we will obviously be doing everything we can.\u201d\n\nThe ACLU is also urging states to act now to prepare for a possible second Trump presidential term. Local elected officials should start planning how to protect their transgender constituents, and states should create funding streams for gender-affirming care to protect access for those who would lose health care without federally funded programs. The organization cites policies created to protect abortion access as examples, like California\u2019s reproductive health equity program and Maryland\u2019s abortion clinical training program.\n\nThe ACLU is working with its state affiliates to organize ideas and potentially necessary resources, Zamore said. Under a hostile administration, states with LGBTQ-friendly governments will need to fill in the gaps for access to gender-affirming care while also standing up for their residents, he said.\n\nTrans Americans and parents of trans youth can also prepare by updating their identity documents, said Gillian Branstetter, communications strategist at the ACLU\u2019s women\u2019s rights project and LGBTQ & HIV Project, who also contributed to the report. Approving name changes, updating birth certificates, and filing for a new passport are all steps that should be taken now, she said.\n\nThe ACLU\u2019s report aims to communicate a way out if some of these policies are implemented, she said, and to organize LGBTQ+ groups around a common focus.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not out of options. We are not without power here,\u201d she said.",

        "text": "US declines to charge Merrick Garland for contempt of Congress\nUS declines to charge Merrick Garland for contempt\n\nThe US Department of Justice (DoJ) has declined to press charges against Attorney General Merrick Garland for contempt of Congress after the House of Representatives narrowly voted to punish him for his refusal to hand over audio tapes from an investigation into President Joe Biden.\n\nThe Republican-controlled House voted 216-207 on Wednesday to recommend that the DoJ, the department that Mr Garland oversees, file criminal charges against America's top law enforcement officer.\n\nThe move stems from Mr Garland's refusal to turn over to Republican lawmakers recorded interviews from a justice department probe of Mr Biden's handling of classified documents.\n\nIn a letter sent to Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson on Friday, a top DoJ official said the department found that Mr Garland's actions \"do not constitute a crime\". Mr Johnson called the move \"sadly predictable\".\n\nCarlos Felipe Uriarte, an assistant attorney general, said it was a \"longstanding position\" of the department not to bring charges in cases where the president has made the decision to conceal the requested material using his power of executive privilege.\n\nExecutive privilege is legal doctrine that grants presidents the right to withhold executive branch information from the other two branches of US government.\n\n\"Accordingly the Department will not bring the congressional contempt citation before a grand jury or take any other action to prosecute the Attorney General,\" Mr Uriarte wrote.\n\nThe House Speaker said he would go to federal court to force the attorney general to hand over the audio.\n\nMr Johnson called the DoJ decision \u201canother example of the two-tiered system of justice brought to us by the Biden Administration\u201d.\n\nHe cited the case of two ex-Trump aides, Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro, who tried to cite executive privilege in flouting congressional subpoenas. They were found in contempt of Congress, criminally prosecuted and sentenced to prison terms.\n\nLast month, Mr Biden invoked executive privilege to block congressional Republicans from accessing tapes of his interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur, who was investigating his retention of classified documents after he served as vice-president.\n\nMr Biden turned in the documents once they had been discovered. The DoJ special counsel who interviewed the Democratic US president said that although he had retained the files, he should not be charged as jurors would probably view him as a \"well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory\".\n\nThe White House said that Republicans had no legitimate need to access the five hours of audio, since a transcript had already been released. They argued that Republicans wanted to use the audio for campaign attack ads against Mr Biden as he seeks his second term as president this November.\n\nAs the oldest US president, 81-year-old Mr Biden's age is seen by opponents as a key political vulnerability. His Republican challenger, Donald Trump, just turned 78.\n\nTrump is facing a federal prosecution on charges of having retained documents that were meant to be handed over to government archivists after he left office.\n\nHe allegedly attempted to obstruct justice by hiding the classified memos after he had been ordered to submit them.\n\nTwo other attorneys general have been held in contempt of Congress in recent years.\n\nIn both cases Eric Holder, a Democrat, and Bill Barr, a Republican, received similar letters from the DoJ stating that prosecutors were declining to press charges.",

Chip Roy (R-Texas), who introduced the measure, told The Post.\n\n\u201cAs President Biden has welcomed millions of illegal aliens through our borders, including sophisticated criminal syndicates and foreign adversaries, it is incumbent upon Congress to implement greater enforcement measures that secure the voter registration process and ensure only American citizens decide the outcome of American elections,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said in a statement following its approval.\n\n8 \u201cAs President Biden has welcomed millions of illegal aliens through our borders \u2026 it is incumbent upon Congress to implement greater enforcement measures that secure the voter registration,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson said. CQ Roll Call-USA TODAY NETWORK\n\n\u201cIt is undeniable that the current structure makes it possible for illegal immigrants and non-citizens to vote \u2014 and the American people have no way of knowing how widespread the problem may be,\u201d Ryan Walker, executive vice president at the conservative Heritage Foundation\u2019s sister group, Heritage Action, told The Post.\n\n\u201cThe SAVE Act puts all of these issues to rest and gives Americans confidence that our elections are decided on a more even playing field,\u201d Walker said.\n\nHouse Republican leaders have yet to schedule a floor vote for the measure, though one Hill source suggested to The Post it could come up before the August recess.\n\nThe left-leaning Campaign Legal Center has opposed the SAVE Act as a \u201cshameful\u201d measure that will \u201cundermine trust in the electoral process,\u201d dismissing concerns over non-citizen voting and declaring it has not taken place \u201cat any meaningful level.\u201d\n\n8 Federal prosecutions and state investigations and audits have shown in recent years that thousands of non-citizens are being registered. Shutterstock / David Peinado Romero\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fabrication being peddled, for personal and political gain, by leaders who should know better,\u201d said Campaign Legal Center executive director Adav Noti in a statement as the House Administration Committee prepared to consider the SAVE Act.\n\n\u201cShameful bills like the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act often result in eligible US citizens being incorrectly prevented from voting or being forced to jump through additional hoops to exercise their freedom to vote.

CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images\n\nHundreds of non-Americans have since been caught after casting ballots in races ranging from the local to the presidential, and subsequently purged from voter rolls.\n\nHans von Spakovsky, a former member of the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and manager of the Election Law Reform Initiative at the Heritage Foundation, presented many such examples in testimony to the House committee ahead of the panel\u2019s May 23 approval of the SAVE Act.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a real problem, not an imaginary problem,\u201d von Spakovsky told The Post.\n\nThe numbers are not enough to change election results \u2014 even in critical swing states like Pennsylvania \u2014 but they are enough to cause consternation as a record-breaking number of migrants have entered the US every year since 2021.\n\n8 A record-breaking number of migrants have entered the US every year since 2021. Shutterstock / David Peinado Romero\n\nThat figure is expected to rise to 8 million by October of this year.\n\nAt the same time, the Biden administration has expanded access to health care and other benefits, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, putting many migrants within reach of voter registration.\n\nAt least 19 states and Washington, DC, also allow non-citizens to obtain driver\u2019s licenses, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a move that Biden supported during his 2020 presidential campaign.\n\nIn March, a federal judge upheld the Arizona law requiring proof of citizenship on state registration forms \u2014 with federal forms only requiring a signed statement confirming US citizenship to comply with the NVRA.\n\n8 The Biden administration has expanded access to health care and other benefits, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, putting many migrants within reach of voter registration. Shutterstock / Melnikov Dmitriy\n\nCarveouts in the SAVE Act also still allow for reasonable accommodations to be made for disabled people who may have a different name on their identity documents, or those who are US citizens but lack documentation and may make a signed attestation.\n\nThe bill would also force states to kick non-citizens off voter rolls, which can be verified through access to federal databases at the Department of Homeland Security and the Social Security Administration.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve seen over the years is [federal agencies] put up all kinds of red tape to make it difficult for state election officials to access their databases,\u201d von Spakovsky noted. \u201cThis bill tries to override that too.\u201d\n\n\u201cCongress has the authority to deal with this issue,\u201d he added, pointing out that the Constitution empowers US lawmakers to sort out questions about naturalization at both the state and federal level.\n\n8 The bill would also force states to kick non-citizens off voter rolls, which can be verified through access to federal databases at the Department of Homeland Security and the Social Security Administration. AFP via Getty Images\n\nVon Spakovsky believes that if the SAVE Act successfully amends the NVRA, proof-of-citizenship laws would \u201cget passed in a lot of states\u201d \u2014 such as New Hampshire, where such a bill is under consideration.\n\nThe SAVE Act would further allow Americans to bring civil lawsuits against election officials who don\u2019t have their agencies demand proof-of-citizenship documents.\n\nA spokesperson for Rep. Joe Morelle (D-NY), the lone Democrat who opposed the bill in committee proceedings, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nEven if it passes the House, the SAVE Act will face an uphill battle for consideration by the Democrat-controlled Senate, though several Republican members of the upper chamber have already signaled their support.\n\n8 A spokesperson for Rep. Joe Morelle (D-NY), the lone Democrat who opposed the bill in committee proceedings, did not respond to a request for comment. CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images\n\n\u201cPreventing non-citizens and illegal aliens from registering and voting in American elections should be a 100% issue in Congress,\u201d Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) told The Post.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Democrats have taken the stance that it never happens \u2014 which is false \u2014 so we shouldn\u2019t give states the tools to ensure it doesn\u2019t happen \u2014 which is absurd,\u201d Lee said.\n\n\u201cThe SAVE Act would defend election integrity and preserve public trust in the voting process,\u201d he added, \u201csomething we need now more than ever.\u201d\n\nCorrection: This article originally stated that federal voter registration forms were available in 49 US states.",

        "text": "These Are The Billionaires Supporting Trump\u2019s Campaign\nTopline\n\nBillionaire megadonors are warming to former President Donald Trump, helping him catch up with President Joe Biden\u2019s early fundraising lead by donating large sums to support his candidacy after many of them backed Trump\u2019s primary opponents or disavowed him when he left office.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump speaks at a rally at Sunset Park on Sunday, June 9, 2024, in Las ... [+] Vegas. (Madeline Carter/Las Vegas Review-Journal/Tribune News Service via Getty Images) TNS\n\nKey Facts\n\nHarold Hamm: The Continental Resources founder and longtime Trump friend\u2014who donated to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley\u2019s and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 primary bids\u2014was among the attendees at the now-infamous April Mar-A-Lago dinner with oil executives where Trump reportedly pitched industry-friendly policies while soliciting a $1 billion donation, and in May, Hamm co-hosted a Houston fundraiser for Trump, Reuters reported. (We estimate Hamm is worth $18.5 billion) Timothy Mellon: A longtime Republican mega-donor and top contributor to Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign, Mellon is the most prolific donor of the 2024 election cycle, USA Today reported, citing OpenSecrets data that shows Mellon donated $25 million each to super PACs backing both Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (We estimate the Mellon family is worth $14.1 billion) Bernie Marcus: The Home depot co-founder gave $1 million to Trump\u2019s main super PAC, MAGA Inc., in the second half of 2023, according to Politico, and he co-hosted an Atlanta fundraiser for Trump in April. (We estimate Marcus is worth $9.6 billion) Kelcy Warren: After donating to DeSantis\u2019 primary bid, marking a reversal from his support for Trump\u2019s 2020 re-election bid, the Energy Transfer pipeline company founder gave upwards of $800,000 to Trump\u2019s campaign apparatus, the Trump 47 committee, in the first quarter, according to FEC filings, and he and co-hosted the May fundraiser with Hamm. (We estimate Warren is worth $6 billion) Isaac Perlmutter: Former chairman and CEO of Marvel Entertainment and a longtime Trump associate who advised him on Veterans Affairs policies during his first term, Perlmutter and his wife, Laura, made the largest donation, $10.1 million, to a new pro-Trump super PAC, Right for America, in the first quarter. (We estimate Perlmutter is worth $4.3 billion) J. Joe Ricketts: Chairman of TD Ameritrade, Ricketts gave the maximum amount, $824,600, to the Trump 47 Committee. (We estimate Ricketts is worth $4 billion) John Paulson: The hedge fund billionaire\u2014who is reportedly on Trump\u2019s shortlist for treasury secretary if he wins a second term\u2014hosted a $50 million fundraiser for Trump at his Palm Beach home in April, and co-hosted a Manhattan fundraiser in May with billionaires Woody Johnson and John Catsimatidis. (We estimate Paulson is worth $3.5 billion) Steve Wynn: Wynn\u2014former casino mogul and Republican National Committee finance chair who was sued by the Justice Department last year for allegedly lobbying Trump on behalf of the Chinese government\u2014was listed as a co-host at Paulson\u2019s Palm Beach fundraiser and donated more than $800,000 to Trump 47 during the first quarter of this year. (We estimate Wynn is worth $3.4 billion) Geoffrey Palmer: One of Trump\u2019s biggest backers in 2016, the Los Angeles real estate magnate donated $1 million to MAGA Inc. in the second half of 2023, Politico reported, and more than $80,000 to Trump 47 in the first quarter of 2024. (We estimate Palmer is worth $3.1 billion) Linda McMahon: Donating $11 million to support Trump this election cycle, making her his second-largest donor after Mellon, McMahon is the co-founder of World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), alongside her husband, Vince McMahon; she served as the administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration under Trump and chairs the America First Policy Institute that promotes Trump\u2019s agenda. (We estimate Vincent McMahon is worth $2.9 billion) Phil Ruffin: The casino magnate, who co-owns with Trump the Trump International Las Vegas hotel and is said to be one of Trump\u2019s closest friends, also donated more than $800,000 to Trump 47 in the first three months of the year, after helping bankroll his 2020 campaign. (We estimate Ruffin is worth $2.6 billion) Timothy Dunn: The Texas oil businessman contributed $5 million to MAGA Inc. in the second half of 2023, according to Politico. (We estimate Dunn is worth $2.2 billion)\n\nWhat To Watch For\n\nSeveral billionaires have indicated plans to donate to Trump, but have yet to make contributions. After calling for a \u201cnew generation of leaders\u201d and sitting out the primary race, Blackstone CEO and co-founder Steve Schwarzman (Forbes valuation: $37.7 billion) said last month he plans to donate to Trump, due in part to \u201cthe dramatic rise of antisemitism.\u201d Citadel hedge fund founder Ken Griffin (Forbes valuation: $37.1 billion), said he\u2019s waiting to see who Trump picks as his vice president before he decides whether to donate. Casino mogul and longtime Trump backer Miriam Adelson (Forbes valuation: $29.2 billion), is expected to make a sizeable donation to the pro-Trump Preserve American super PAC, which received a $90 million donation from her and her late husband, Sheldon Adelson, during the 2020 campaign, according to multiple reports. Pershing Square Capital Management founder Bill Ackman (Forbes valuation: $9.3 billion), is widely expected to endorse Trump after previously backing Kennedy\u2019s and Haley\u2019s primary campaigns. Liz Uihlein, who co-founded Uline shipping and packaging company with her husband Dick Uihlein, told the Financial Times in March they would support Trump, after donating to DeSantis\u2019 primary campaign\u201d (Forbes valuation: $6.7 billion each). After apologizing for supporting Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign in the wake of Jan. 6, billionaire investor Nelson Peltz (Forbes valuation: $1.6 billion) indicated he would reluctantly support him again in 2024, citing concerns about immigration and Biden\u2019s age, telling the Financial Times in March \u201cit will probably be Trump, and I\u2019m not happy about that.\u201d\n\nForbes Valuation\n\nWe estimate Trump is worth $6.1 billion.\n\nBig Number\n\n$141 million. That\u2019s how much Trump\u2019s campaign and the Republican National Committee said they raised in May, with 37% of it coming from online contributions in the 24 hours after his felony convictions in Manhattan last month.\n\nContra\n\nBiden had an early fundraising lead over Trump, ending March with $192 million on hand, a sum his campaign said was the largest war chest ever amassed by a Democratic nominee at that point in the election cycle. Biden also has the support of several billionaires, including Renaissance Technologies\u2019 billionaire co-founder James Simons and his wife Marilyn, who gave $6 million to the pro-Biden Future Forward PAC in the first quarter. LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman also gave $6 million, and former Facebook chief operating officer, billionaire Sheryl Sandberg, gave $1 million. Biden\u2019s fundraising slowed in April to $51 million, after his campaign and his affiliated committees raised more than $90 million in March. Trump and the RNC reported raising $76 million in April.\n\nTangent\n\nTesla owner and billionaire Elon Musk\u2014the richest person in the world with a valuation of $210.4 billion\u2014is also helping to boost Trump\u2019s campaign by rallying support for him in the notoriously liberal Silicon Valley tech community. While Musk has said he won\u2019t financially support a candidate this year, he\u2019s actively working to prevent Biden from being elected. He met with Trump in March at Peltz\u2019s Palm Beach home, The Washington Post reported, and he\u2019s hosted gatherings of business leaders to discuss ways to oppose Biden, according to the Wall Street Journal. Musk defended Trump in the wake of his guilty verdict, tweeting \u201cgreat damage was done today to the public\u2019s faith in the American legal system.\u201d\n\nKey Background\n\nSince he clinched the nomination in March, Trump has stepped up his fundraising, attending high-dollar events and meeting with business executives behind closed doors, where he\u2019s reportedly pitched industry-friendly policies while suggesting they should donate large sums to his campaign. At the April Mar-A-Lago dinner with oil industry executives, Trump urged them to donate $1 billion to support his candidacy, then detailed how he would roll back Biden environmental regulations, approve more off-shore oil drilling and lift Biden\u2019s moratorium on permits for new liquefied natural gas exports, The Washington Post reported. At the Texas fundraiser hosted by Hamm in May, Trump told oil execs \u201cI\u2019m begging for your money,\u201d according to The Washington Post. On Thursday, he met with about 80 wealthy CEOs, including Apple\u2019s Tim Cook and JP Morgan\u2019s Jamie Dimon, at the powerful Business Roundtable lobbying group\u2019s annual meeting in Washington, where he floated proposals to cut the corporate tax rate from 21% to 20%, Bloomberg reported, and said one of his first priorities if he won a second term would be to \u201cunleash American energy,\u201d Trump economic adviser Stephen Moore told Reuters.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nThese Are The Big-Money Donors Backing Trump\u2014As He Trails Biden\u2019s Fundraising (Forbes)\n\nTrump-Aligned Billionaires\u2014Including Elon Musk And Bill Ackman\u2014Defend Him After Guilty Verdict (Forbes)\n\nBillionaire Ken Griffin Praises Trump Despite Backing Primary Rivals\u2014But Won\u2019t Endorse Trump Until He Picks A VP (Forbes)",

        "text": "Biden and Trump campaigns agreed to mic muting, podiums among rules for upcoming CNN debate\nCNN \u2014\n\nWith less than two weeks until the first presidential debate of the 2024 election cycle, CNN has released additional details on the parameters agreed upon by the Trump and Biden campaigns.\n\nThe debate, which will be hosted by CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper and Dana Bash in Atlanta on June 27, will mark the first in-person showdown of the 2024 campaign between President Joe Biden and his predecessor, former President Donald Trump. Both candidates have accepted the network\u2019s invitation and agreed to accept the rules and format of the debate, as outlined in letters sent to the campaigns by the network in May.\n\nThe 90-minute debate will include two commercial breaks, according to the network, and campaign staff may not interact with their candidate during that time.\n\nBoth candidates agreed to appear at a uniform podium, and their podium positions will be determined by a coin flip.\n\nMicrophones will be muted throughout the debate except for the candidate whose turn it is to speak. While no props or pre-written notes will be allowed on the stage, candidates will be given a pen, a pad of paper and a bottle of water.\n\nSome aspects of the debate \u2013 including the absence of a studio audience \u2013 will be a departure from previous debates. But, as in the past, the moderators \u201cwill use all tools at their disposal to enforce timing and ensure a civilized discussion,\u201d according to the network.\n\nIn order to meet CNN\u2019s qualifications for the debate, candidates must satisfy the requirements outlined in Article II, Section 1 of the US Constitution to serve as president. Both Biden and Trump meet those requirements, as do Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Cornel West and Jill Stein, who are running on non-major-party tickets.\n\nParticipants must also file a formal statement of candidacy to the Federal Election Commission. All five have done so.\n\nAll participating debaters must appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to reach the 270 electoral vote threshold to win the presidency and receive at least 15% in four separate national polls of registered or likely voters that meet CNN\u2019s standards for reporting. Polls that meet those standards are those sponsored by CNN, ABC News, CBS News, Fox News, Marquette University Law School, Monmouth University, NBC News, The New York Times/Siena College, NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist College, Quinnipiac University, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post.\n\nThough not impossible in Kennedy\u2019s case, it is less likely that candidates other than Biden and Trump will meet those requirements.\n\nKennedy has received at least 15% in three qualifying polls so far and is currently on the ballot in six states, making him currently eligible for 89 Electoral College votes.",

        "text": "FACT SHEET: The 2024 G7 Summit in Apulia, Italy\nJUNE 14, 2024\n\nPuglia, Italy\n\nPresident Biden and G7 leaders stood united at the G7 Summit in Apulia, Italy, taking bold action to meet the tests of our time: supporting Ukraine\u2019s fight for freedom and driving up the costs of Russia\u2019s war, pushing back on unfair economic practices, tackling the climate crisis and food and health insecurity, harnessing critical technologies for the benefit of all, and working with partners around the world to support developing countries investing in their futures.\n\nSupporting Ukraine\u2019s Fight for Freedom\n\nJoined by Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, G7 leaders reaffirmed their unwavering support for Ukraine for as long as it takes \u2013 sending an unmistakable signal to Putin that he will not outlast our resolve.\n\nUnlocking $50 billion for Ukraine: G7 leaders announced a plan to provide Ukraine with $50 billion in new financing by bringing forward the interest earned on immobilized Russian sovereign assets held in the European Union and other jurisdictions. Leaders reaffirmed their commitment that Russia\u2019s sovereign assets within G7 jurisdictions will remain immobilized until Russia ends its aggression and pays for the damage it has caused to Ukraine. This new financing will provide critically needed support for Ukraine\u2019s military, budget, and reconstruction needs. The United States will work with Ukraine and G7 partners in the coming months to finalize the details of the financing arrangement and issue the loan by the end of the year.\n\nG7 leaders announced a plan to provide Ukraine with $50 billion in new financing by bringing forward the interest earned on immobilized Russian sovereign assets held in the European Union and other jurisdictions.

The United States will work with Ukraine and G7 partners in the coming months to finalize the details of the financing arrangement and issue the loan by the end of the year. Driving Up Costs for the Russian War Machine: The Biden Administration this week issued a sweeping set of new sanctions and export control measures, guided by G7 commitments to intensify the pressure on Russia for its war against Ukraine. Foreign banks now face increased sanctions risk when they deal with Russia\u2019s war economy. New sanctions on more than 300 individuals and entities in Russia, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), and globally target Russia\u2019s financial infrastructure; over a dozen international evasion and procurement networks; Russia\u2019s future energy, metals, and mining revenues; and Russian elites involved in the deportation or so-called re-education of Ukrainian children. The Administration also announced steps to restrict access to certain U.S. software and information technology services, to crack down on diversion of goods through shell companies, and to more extensively restrict exports to entities that supply Russia with U.S.-branded items produced overseas.\n\nThe Biden Administration this week issued a sweeping set of new sanctions and export control measures, guided by G7 commitments to intensify the pressure on Russia for its war against Ukraine.

Supporting Ukraine Now and in the Future. In Puglia, President Biden and President Zelensky signed the U.S.-Ukraine Bilateral Security Agreement as a demonstration of enduring U.S. support for Ukraine, including through binding commitments to deepen our security and defense cooperation and to consult in the event of a future armed attack.\n\nAdvancing International Peace, Security, and Prosperity\n\nThe G7\u2019s work is grounded in a shared commitment to respect the UN Charter, promote international peace and security, and uphold the free and open rules-based international order.\n\nCalling for a Comprehensive Deal in Gaza: The G7 was united in supporting the comprehensive deal outlined by President Biden that would lead to an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all hostages, a significant and sustained increase in the flow of humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza, and an enduring end to the crisis, with Israel\u2019s security interests and safety for Palestinian civilians in Gaza assured.\n\nThe G7 was united in supporting the comprehensive deal outlined by President Biden that would lead to an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all hostages, a significant and sustained increase in the flow of humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza, and an enduring end to the crisis, with Israel\u2019s security interests and safety for Palestinian civilians in Gaza assured. Standing with Allies and Partners in the Indo-Pacific: President Biden discussed robust U.S. engagement in the Indo-Pacific to strengthen our alliances and partnerships, and welcomed the increasing connectivity between European and Indo-Pacific partners. He joined with other leaders in stressing the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and in raising concerns regarding the PRC\u2019s dangerous actions in the South China Sea.\n\nPresident Biden discussed robust U.S. engagement in the Indo-Pacific to strengthen our alliances and partnerships, and welcomed the increasing connectivity between European and Indo-Pacific partners.

Deepening Cooperation with Partners in Africa: The G7 is working together with African partners to contribute to global stability and prosperity, and have endorsed African countries\u2019 call for greater voice in international bodies.\n\nPromoting Economic Resilience and Economic Security\n\nPresident Biden rallied the G7 to take further steps to protect our workers, industries, and the investments we are making from begin undermined by the PRC\u2019s unfair practices. The PRC\u2019s policies are creating global spillovers, including harmful overcapacity, that undercut market firms and lead to supply chain dependencies in sectors such as solar, wind, electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries, medical devices, mature-node semiconductors, steel, aluminum, and others.\n\nWorking Together to Level the Playing Field and Protect Economic Security: The G7 pledged to work together to confront non-market policies and practices and efforts to dominate strategic sectors. The G7 will undertake new monitoring and information-sharing efforts, update our respective toolkits to counter harmful practices, and coordinate efforts to deter and respond to economic coercion.\n\nThe G7 pledged to work together to confront non-market policies and practices and efforts to dominate strategic sectors.

Protecting Critical and Sensitive Technologies: We are updating our respective tools to protect certain critical and sensitive technologies from being used to undermine international peace and security, while avoiding broader restrictions on international trade and investment. The G7 is also strengthening cooperation on research security, data security, and investment screening efforts, and coordinating to streamline the implementation of export controls.\n\nPartnering with Developing Countries to Invest in their Future\n\nThe G7 is taking ambitious steps to scale up support to developing countries and accelerate progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nBreaking the Global Debt Impasse: Recognizing that mounting debt burdens are putting developing countries\u2019 ability to make such critical investments out of reach, President Biden \u2013 alongside Kenyan President Ruto \u2013 championed and garnered G7 support for the Nairobi-Washington Vision that calls on the international community to step up support for developing countries to make critical investments and reforms. The G7 committed to work with the IMF, World Bank, and other stakeholders to bring this plan forward, with a view to realizing it for pilot countries this year.\n\nRecognizing that mounting debt burdens are putting developing countries\u2019 ability to make such critical investments out of reach, President Biden \u2013 alongside Kenyan President Ruto \u2013 championed and garnered G7 support for the Nairobi-Washington Vision that calls on the international community to step up support for developing countries to make critical investments and reforms.

Boosting the Financial Power of the International Financial Institutions: President Biden further championed efforts to deliver better, bigger, more effective multilateral development banks (MDBs). The G7 rallied together to announce planned contributions which, once approved domestically, would make it possible for the World Bank to boost lending by $70 billion over the next decade. This is on top of efforts from the United States and other MDB shareholders to unlock over $250 billion in new lending capacity at these institutions.\n\nPresident Biden further championed efforts to deliver better, bigger, more effective multilateral development banks (MDBs).

G7 leaders and private sector executives reaffirmed their commitment to unlocking public and private capital for investments in partner countries, demonstrated by BlackRock\u2019s announcement that a group of investors plan to invest at least $4 billion in alignment with PGI priorities and Microsoft\u2019s announcement of $5 billion in recent digital infrastructure investments in emerging markets. President Biden announced new projects and highlighted progress on PGI economic corridors, including the Lobito Corridor in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Luzon Corridor in the Philippines. The United States has mobilized more than $60 billion to date towards PGI.\n\nAccelerating the Clean Energy Transition to Address Climate Change\n\nThe G7 is accelerating its work to address the challenges of climate change, pollution, and biodiversity loss. G7 members reaffirmed ambitious COP28 commitments to triple renewable energy capacity, double global energy efficiency by 2030, and strengthen energy security.\n\nPhasing Out Unabated Coal Power and Increasing Energy Storage: The G7 has committed for the first time to phase out unabated coal power generation in energy systems during the first half of the 2030s. The G7 has also further set a target to deploy 1,500 GW of long-duration energy storage by 2030, building on top of the COP28 pledge to triple globally installed renewable energy by 2030.\n\nThe G7 has committed for the first time to phase out unabated coal power generation in energy systems during the first half of the 2030s.

Promoting International Collaboration on Nuclear and Fusion Energy: The G7 recognized nuclear energy as a clean/zero emissions energy source that can reduce dependence on fossil fuels to address the climate crisis and improve global energy security, and pledged to support multilateral efforts to strengthen the resilience of nuclear supply chains. Recognizing the potential for fusion energy to serve as a breakthrough energy solution, the G7 is establishing a Working Group on Fusion Energy to share best practices and promote cooperation on research and development.\n\nPromoting Health and Food Security\n\nThe G7 continues to lead global efforts to address the food security crisis and support strong, resilient and responsive health systems around the world.\n\nLaunching the Apulia Food Security Initiative: G7 leaders joined Italy in launching the Apulia Food Security Initiative to address structural barriers to food security and nutrition and build more resilient, sustainable, and productive agriculture and food systems. Aligned with the United States\u2019 signature food security initiative, The Feed the Future Initiative, as well as the Vision for Adapted Crops and Soils, the G7 recommitted to investing in sustainable and resilient food systems and in healthy, fertile soil management and climate-adapted crop varieties.\n\nG7 leaders joined Italy in launching the Apulia Food Security Initiative to address structural barriers to food security and nutrition and build more resilient, sustainable, and productive agriculture and food systems.

Semans, a Sicangu Lakota citizen living on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota and co-executive director of Four Directions, a voting rights advocacy group that has worked on behalf of tribes in several states.\n\n\u201cYou must remember, the old Pony Express [mail delivery on horseback] wasn\u2019t meant for reservations.

But you\u2019d never get the ballot back,\u201d he said.\n\nStates pass restrictive laws\n\nThe 1965 Voting Rights Act banned traditional forms of voter discrimination such as literacy tests, character assessments and other practices widely used to disenfranchise minority voters.\n\nIt authorized the federal government to oversee voter registration and election procedures in certain states and localities with histories of discriminatory practices, and it also required those jurisdictions to obtain \u201cpreclearance\u201d from the Justice Department or a federal court before changing voting laws or procedures.\n\nIn 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the formula for deciding which localities needed preclearance as unconstitutional, opening the way for states to pass new voting laws.\n\nDuring a Senate Indian Affairs Committee hearing in 2021, Jacqueline De Leon, an enrolled member of the Isleta Pueblo and a staff attorney at the Native American Rights Fund, or NARF, described some conditions for Indigenous voters.\n\n\u201cIn South Dakota, Native American voters were forced to vote in a repurposed chicken coop with no bathroom facilities and feathers on the floor,\u201d she testified.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Native Americans were required to cast their ballots inside a sheriff\u2019s office.\n\nNARF, tribes fight back\n\nIn 2021, President Joe Biden created the Interagency Steering Group on Native American Voting Rights to report on barriers facing Native voters.\n\n\u201cNative American communities have not been immune, but indeed have been packed or divided by district lines that dilute their vote or otherwise discriminate,\u201d the group reported.\n\nIn November 2021, North Dakota\u2019s Republican-led legislature approved a new legislative map that separated state House districts on the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation and the Fort Berthold reservation, home to the Three Affiliated Tribes.\n\nThe Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa and Spirit Lake tribes filed a federal lawsuit arguing that the new map violated the Voting Rights Act by packing the Turtle Mountain band \u2014 that is, concentrating them into a single electoral district to reduce their influence in other districts, and cracking \u2014 or dividing \u2014 the Spirit Lake tribe across districts to dilute their voting power.\n\n\u201cA conservative judge found this was a clear violation of the Voting Rights Act,\u201d De Leon told VOA. \u201cAnd rather than protect its Native constituents where there was a violation, the state has appealed, trying to just block the cost of action as opposed to remediating the discrimination.\u201d\n\nArizona passed a law in 2022 requiring voters to provide proof of their physical address.\n\n\u201cAnd that was really an attack on the Native vote because about 40,000 homes in Indian Country in Arizona don't have traditional addresses on them or any way to prove residential location,\u201d De Leon said.\n\nWith NARF\u2019s support, the Tohono O\u2019odham Nation and the Gila River Indian Community in 2022 filed suit in U.S. District Court for Arizona. In 2023, the court ruled in their favor, finding that the address requirements violated tribe members\u2019 constitutional right to vote.\n\nWith five months to go before November\u2019s general election, Semans said, Indigenous voting rights activists must stay vigilant.\n\n\u201cWith this new Supreme Court, even rulings that we got years ago that were positive for Indian country could change before then,\u201d he said. \u201cThings can change on a dime.\u201d",

        "text": "Partisan gridlock prevents fixes to Pennsylvania\u2019s voting laws as presidential election looms\nHARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) \u2014 Pennsylvania is seeing lots of action targeting gaps in its vote-by-mail laws. The problem is that it\u2019s in the courtroom and not the legislature.\n\nThat could make the most populous presidential swing state a hotbed of challenges and conspiracy theories if the November election is close, as expected.\n\nThe state also has a U.S. Senate contest between Democratic incumbent Bob Casey and Republican challenger David McCormick that will help determine control of the chamber, increasing scrutiny on election offices if lawmakers can\u2019t break a partisan stalemate and vote-counting is slowed by mailed ballots.\n\n\u201cEveryone just really feels how high the stakes are in Pennsylvania, being the largest swing state in the country,\u201d said Lauren Cristella, president and CEO of the Committee of Seventy, a Philadelphia-based good-government group.\n\nPolitical gridlock in Pennsylvania over election laws dates to 2019, when a Republican-controlled legislature greatly expanded voting by mail in a compromise with then-Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf.\n\nWithin months, then-President Donald Trump began, without evidence, demonizing voting by mail as rife with fraud, turning Republican voters against it and leading Republican lawmakers to backtrack on their support. He has taken contradictory stances this year \u2014 promoting mail voting while also supporting lawsuits against it.\n\nThe attacks on mail voting have created partisan battle lines around attempts to fix it in Pennsylvania.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nDemocrats also want to add early in-person voting, a convenience already adopted by most states, but it\u2019s been a nonstarter for Republicans. Unlike some other states, Pennsylvanian voters can\u2019t change their election laws because the state constitution doesn\u2019t allow citizens to write their own ballot initiatives.\n\nAs a result, election-related lawsuits are sprouting in state, federal and county courts, nearly all targeting mail-in voting.\n\nAcross the country, Republicans are trying more than ever now to get their voters to vote by mail, a striking change for a party that amplified conspiracy theories about mail ballots in an attempt to explain away Trump\u2019s 2020 loss.\n\nStill, voting by mail remains largely the province of Democrats. In Pennsylvania, roughly three-fourths of mail-in ballots tend to be cast by Democrats.\n\nAmong the most important fixes to the state\u2019s mail balloting law is one sought by counties. It would allow local election offices to begin processing mail-in ballots before Election Day, something nearly every other state with mail voting allows. That would help them produce results more quickly on election night.\n\nDemocrats also have sought to resolve a storm of litigation by clarifying the law so that mail-in ballots that lack a handwritten date on the outer envelope, a signature or an inner secrecy envelope can still be counted. Thousands of those ballots get thrown out, although Democratic-leaning counties typically try to help voters fix those errors, so their ballots will count.\n\nWithout any fixes in state law, Democrats expect a repeat in November of the chaos around the 2020 election.\n\nPennsylvania\u2019s Democratic Party chair, Sharif Street, said the state is capable of having a fair and well-run election under its existing laws. But, he said, Trump and his allies aren\u2019t interested in that.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want a smooth process in Pennsylvania or anywhere, because he believes that the chaos benefits him both in the run-up to the election, because he can rally people around saying that \u2018There is going to be a steal,\u2019 and then post-election ... (he can) point to irregularities to say that he is the rightful winner, when in fact he\u2019s lost,\u201d Street said.\n\nTrump has been sowing doubts about this year\u2019s election for months. At a rally last weekend, he said only widespread fraud could prevent him from getting reelected. \u201cThe only way they can beat us is to cheat,\u201d he told supporters in Las Vegas.\n\nBaseless allegations about fraud filled the vacuum during Pennsylvania\u2019s protracted post-election vote count in 2020.\n\nCharlie Gerow, a longtime Republican activist and strategist in Pennsylvania, said the GOP will be prepared to report and document fraud in ways it wasn\u2019t prepared for in that year\u2019s election. To be clear, voter fraud is extremely rare, typically involves just a few ballots and even involves Republican voters \u2014 some of whom have cast extra ballots for Trump.\n\nAn Associated Press investigation in 2021 found fewer than 475 cases of potential voter fraud across the six states where Trump disputed his loss, not nearly enough to tip the election. In Pennsylvania alone, Biden beat Trump by more than 80,000 votes.\n\nWhen Democrats brought legislation to a House vote seeking to let counties process mailed ballots before Election Day \u2014 called pre-canvassing \u2014 a Republican lawmaker warned it \u201ccould lead to various forms of abuse and fraud.\u201d\n\nPennsylvania Secretary of State Al Schmidt, a Republican, said he hasn\u2019t heard of a single state where that sort of fraud has occurred.\n\nThe legislation passed the Pennsylvania House, which is narrowly controlled by Democrats, but is stalled in the Senate, where majority Republicans are demanding that the House first pass a constitutional amendment to expand voter identification requirements.\n\n\u201cI am very worried about public perception and public concern that our process is not secure, and we need to figure out opportunities to make that process more secure,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman, a Republican.\n\nDemocratic House Majority Leader Matt Bradford said he also is worried by the legislative stalemate and its potential impact in November.\n\n\u201cWe passed pre-canvassing to try to bring some semblance of certainty quickly, to give people a winner as quickly and accurately as possible,\u201d Bradford said. \u201cThat has continued to languish.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, fights over mail voting in the state are piling up in the courts.\n\nOne lawsuit by Republican lawmakers would force mail-in ballots to be counted in polling places, rather than county election offices. That would add \u201cimmense complexity and burden to election administration,\u201d county governments opposed to the lawsuit said in court documents.\n\nDemocrats and left-leaning groups are suing in state and federal courts over the practice of throwing out mail-in ballots with a missing or incorrect handwritten date on the outer envelope.\n\nAnd at least two Republican-controlled counties are being sued over their refusal to help voters fix technical errors with mail-in ballots \u2014 such as a missing date or inner secrecy envelope \u2014 to avoid the ballot getting tossed out.\n\nA bright spot is that counties are getting better at counting mail-in ballots.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, 2.6 million voters \u2014 nearly 40% of the total in Pennsylvania \u2014 cast ballots by mail. That overwhelmed counties and required almost four days of post-election vote-counting before a presidential winner could be declared, deciding the contest.\n\nCounties since then have bought more high-speed processing equipment and fine-tuned their Election Day routines to count more efficiently.\n\nAllegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh, expects to produce results on election night. In 2020, it needed most of the next day.\n\nPhiladelphia expects to wrap up most of its counting this fall within roughly 24 hours after polls close, a task that could be finished by election night if given the ability to process the ballots before Election Day.\n\n\u201cThat is a very normal practice that happens all over the country,\u201d said Seth Bluestein, a Republican election commissioner in Philadelphia. \u201cThe fact that we can\u2019t do that in Pennsylvania is what will cause us to not count all the ballots on election night. It is the only cause, and the Legislature could have fixed it.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Marc Levy: twitter.com/timelywriter\n\n___\n\nFollow the AP\u2019s coverage of the 2024 election at https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024.",

        "text": "South Africa\u2019s President Ramaphosa is reelected for second term after a dramatic late coalition deal\nCAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) \u2014 South African President Cyril Ramaphosa was reelected by lawmakers for a second term on Friday, after his party struck a dramatic late coalition deal with a former political foe just hours before the vote.\n\nRamaphosa, the leader of the African National Congress, won convincingly in Parliament against a surprise candidate who was also nominated \u2014 Julius Malema of the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters. Ramaphosa received 283 votes to Malema\u2019s 44 in the 400-member house.\n\nThe 71-year-old Ramaphosa secured his second term with the help of lawmakers from the country\u2019s second biggest party, the Democratic Alliance, and some smaller parties. They backed him in the vote and got him over the finish line following the ANC\u2019s loss of its long-held majority in a landmark election two weeks ago that reduced it to 159 seats in Parliament.\n\nDuring a break in what turned out to be a marathon parliamentary session, the ANC signed the last-minute agreement with the DA, effectively ensuring Ramaphosa stays on as the leader of Africa\u2019s most industrialized economy. The parties will now co-govern South Africa in its first national coalition where no party has a majority in Parliament.\n\nThe deal, referred to as a government of national unity, brings the ANC together with the DA, a white-led party that had for years been the main opposition and the fiercest critic of the ANC. At least two other smaller parties also joined the agreement.\n\nRamaphose called the deal \u2014 which sent South Africa into uncharted waters \u2014 a \u201cnew birth, a new era for our country\u201d and said it was time for parties \u201cto overcome their differences and to work together.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is what we shall do and this is what I am committed to achieve as the president,\u201d he said.\n\nThe ANC \u2014 the famed party of Nelson Mandela \u2014 had ruled South Africa with a comfortable majority since the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule in 1994.\n\nBut it lost its 30-year majority in the humbling national election on May 29, a turning point for the country. The vote was held against the backdrop of widespread discontent from South Africans over high levels of poverty, inequality and unemployment.\n\nAnalysts warn there might be complications ahead, though, given the starkly different ideologies of the ANC, a former liberation movement, and the centrist, business-friendly DA, which won 21% of the vote in the national election, the second largest share behind the ANC\u2019s 40%.\n\nFor one, the DA disagreed with the ANC government\u2019s move to accuse Israel of genocide in Gaza in a highly sensitive case at the United Nations\u2019 top court.\n\nThe DA leader John Steenhuisen was the first to confirm the agreement.\n\n\u201cFrom today, the DA will co-govern the Republic of South Africa in a spirit of unity and collaboration,\u201d he said as he stepped away from Friday\u2019s proceedings for a speech carried live on television in which he said a deal was signed and that the DA lawmakers would vote for Ramaphosa for president.\n\nThe Parliament session started at 10 a.m. in the unusual setting of a conference center near Cape Town\u2019s waterfront, after the city\u2019s historic National Assembly building was gutted in a fire in 2022. The house first went through the hourslong swearing-in of hundreds of new lawmakers and electing a speaker and a deputy speaker.\n\nThe vote for president started late at night, with the results announced well after 10 p.m. Ramaphosa finished his acceptance speech as the clock ticked past midnight and into Saturday.\n\nFormer President Jacob Zuma\u2019s MK Party boycotted the session but that did not affect the voting as only a third of the house is needed for a quorum.\n\nANC Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula said the party was open to talking with anyone else who wanted to join the unity government. There are 18 political parties represented in Parliament and he said the multi-party agreement would \u201cprioritize the country across the political and ideological divide.\u201d\n\nSome parties, including Malema\u2019s EFF, refused to join.\n\nThe two other parties that joined the coalition deal were the Inkatha Freedom Party and the Patriotic Alliance, which has drawn attention partly because its leader, Gayton McKenzie, served a prison sentence for bank robbery.\n\nMcKenzie said he had been given a second chance in life and that South Africa also had one now, a chance to solve its deep socioeconomic problems.\n\nThe ANC had faced a deadline to strike a coalition agreement as Parliament had to vote for the president within 14 days after election results were declared on June 2. The ANC had been trying to strike a coalition agreement for two weeks and the final negotiations went on overnight Thursday to Friday, party officials said.\n\nSouth Africa has not faced that level of political uncertainty since the ANC swept to power in the 1994 first all-race election that ended nearly a half-century of racial segregation. Since then, every South African leader has come from the ANC, starting with Mandela.\n\nThe new unity government also harked back to the way Mandela, South Africa\u2019s first Black president, invited political opponents to be part of a unity government in 1994 in an act of reconciliation when the ANC had a majority. Ramaphosa had played a key role in those negotiations as a young politician.\n\nThis time, the ANC\u2019s hand was forced.\n\n\u201cThe ANC has been very magnanimous in that they have accepted defeat and have said, \u2018let\u2019s talk,\u2019\u201d PA leader McKenzie said.\n\n___\n\nMagome reported from Johannesburg.\n\n___\n\nAP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa",

        "text": "When a Trump rally T-shirt is more than just a shirt\nWhen a Trump rally T-shirt is more than just a shirt\n\ntoggle caption Giorgio Viera/AFP via Getty Images\n\nTrump rallies involve a lot of merch \u2014 vendors sometimes set up overnight before a rally, preparing for the huge crowds. There are hats, socks, flags, buttons and, especially, T-shirts.\n\nI go to a lot of these rallies. In the middle of it all, I've gotten a little obsessed with this one particular shirt.\n\nMiranda Barbee bought one in the hours before a Trump rally on the beach in Wildwood, New Jersey, and held it up, reading aloud.\n\n\"I just bought this shirt for $20. It says 'Biden sucks, Kamala' \u2014 what does that even \u2014 'swallows'? I didn't even see the front! That is so funny.\" She flipped it around. \"And the back says, 'F**k Joe and the Hoe.'\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nShe and the friend she came with laughed.\n\n\"I honestly didn't know the front said that,\" Barbee added. \"But I think that's hilarious.\"\n\nThese shirts have been sold prominently at recent rallies \u2014 vendors who specialize in these particular shirts often stand right outside the entrances and exits, catching the eyes of the streams of Trump fans.\n\nThey're not official campaign apparel. When asked for comment, a campaign spokesperson didn't address the shirts directly, instead pointing to a Biden official campaign shirt (slogan: \"Free on Wednesdays\") that pokes fun at Donald Trump's legal troubles.\n\nStill, I wanted to know: why? Why do these shirts exist, and who's buying them? Sooner or later, I had spent so much time thinking about it, I wanted to know if there was anything to be learned here.\n\n\n\nThe infamous Hillary Clinton nutcracker\n\ntoggle caption Paul J. Richards/AFP via Getty Images\n\nSexism isn't exactly new in politics.\n\nConsider America's decades of Hillary Clinton hatred. One T-shirt slogan around the time of her 2008 presidential campaign read \"I wish Hillary had married O.J.,\" referring to O.J. Simpson who famously faced trial for his wife's murder. He was acquitted.\n\nAnd then there was the Hillary Clinton nutcracker\u2026described gleefully by MSNBC's Willie Geist in 2007 as \"a Hillary doll with serrated stainless steel thighs that, well, crack nuts.\" To this, Tucker Carlson \u2014 then also of MSNBC \u2014 responded, \"When she comes on television, I involuntarily cross my legs\" and declared that he would be buying one.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nOver the years, Michelle Obama, Nancy Pelosi and Sarah Palin would also be the targets of demeaning, often obscene merchandise.\n\nBut still, the open lewdness of the Trump T-shirts. That's new, right? I asked Tim Miller, a Republican strategist who worked for Jon Huntsman and Jeb Bush's presidential campaigns.\n\n\"It's not like you couldn't find a guy standing outside the RNC in 2012 selling some misogynistic Hillary stuff. It was there, but just the intensity of it,\" he said, \"just how crass it is, it's definitely a category difference.\"\n\nThat crassness has been around from the beginning at Trump rallies. As my colleague Don Gonyea reported in 2016, vendors then were selling shirts reading, \"Hillary sucks, but not the way Monica does.\"\n\n\n\nThe difference between parties\n\n\"What's different about Donald Trump is that his campaign is not particularly worried about this type of misogyny being attached to his campaign, because at least to date, it hasn't hurt him that much,\" explained Kelly Dittmar, director of research for the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.\n\ntoggle caption Danielle Kurtzleben/NPR\n\nOne example: Even after a jury found him civilly liable for sexual abuse last year, polls didn't budge.\n\nPart of what's going on is partisan, Dittmar adds \u2014 a reflection of an existing gender gap.\n\n\"I think there's more kind of internal policing among Democrats about the fact that, 'this is contrary to our brand and it hurts us, by the way, with the constituency that is our most reliable one, which is women.'\"\n\nFurthermore, she says, this kind of language is often particularly directed at women of color, like Kamala Harris. The word \"ho'\" on the shirt undeniably makes this about race as well as sex.\n\nMeanwhile, Dittmar says, the Republican base is majority-men.\n\n\"And of course,\" she said, \"of the women who do support [Republicans], they are more likely to say that this is just, you know, a joke.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThat was true of voter Christena Kincaid, who talked to me just after she had bought one of these shirts at a rally in Freeland, Michigan.\n\n\"It's just a slang. That's all it is,\" she said. \"It's a goofy \u2014 it is a little over the top. I get it. But they're just words.\"\n\nThat idea, that they're just words, fits with Trump's brand as an anti-PC crusader who \"tells it like it is,\" which has involved loudly insulting women, from Clinton to Megyn Kelly to Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar.\n\nBut also, the idea that words don't matter that much \u2014 that echoes the response to the infamous Access Hollywood tape, which Trump's defenders shrugged off as \"locker room talk.\"\n\n\n\nTrickle-down incivility\n\nRina Shah is a political strategist and a former Republican congressional aide, and a Republican who opposes Trump. She told me she thinks the shirts very much matter.\n\n\"If we're allowing our kids to see this visually, even if it's contained at a rally, the person who wears that shirt at that rally isn't just going to wear that one day,\" she said. \"This flavor of incivility is permeating our nation's social fabric.\"\n\nI did ask Bob Berger, who I met at that Freeland, Mich., rally, about wearing the shirt outside of a rally.\n\n\"Are you worried about offending anyone when you wear it?\" I asked.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Do you think you'll be careful where you wear it? Like around, I don't know, grandkids?\" I continued.\n\n\"Oh, maybe around the grandkids. I probably would be,\" he replied.\n\nWhat Rina Shah said about Trump's incivility trickling down to his supporters seems true, whether it's via clothing or simply their willingness to get nasty in talking about Biden and Harris.\n\n\"As much as I hope Joe Biden gets arrested, whatever, is not in office anymore. I'm like, we're still stuck with the bitch. I don't want her either,\" said Barbee, the voter I met at that New Jersey rally, referring to Harris.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nI asked her: Does that language feel demeaning to you as a young woman \u2014 using words like bitch?\n\n\"I mean, she is a bitch,\" she responded.\n\nOn top of that, you can also see all this \u2014 the T-shirt slogans, the cuss words, Trump's vulgarity \u2014 as a marker of a gap in American politics: a yawning partisan gap in attitudes about gender.\n\n\"Those differences in gender beliefs are going to make it more permissible or not to put forth these types of messages without some sort of a backlash or pushing down,\" Dittmar of Rutgers University said.\n\nStudies have found that Trump voters \u2014 including women \u2014 in 2016 were particularly likely to have beliefs that political scientists term \"hostile sexism.\" Furthermore, some found that these beliefs were prominent in a way they weren't in 2012. Those \"hostile sexist\" beliefs include, for example, the idea that women are too easily offended.\n\nBarbee, at that New Jersey rally, the voter who talked to me the longest about her shirt, echoed some of those beliefs.\n\n\"I feel like feminism is becoming like a huge thing these days, but I also feel like it's \u2014 people are overly sensitive, like they're reacting to things they shouldn't be reacting to. \"\n\nIt's an attitude that's been around for a long time. But her new T-shirt? That represented something new.",

        "text": "If Everyone Voted, Would Biden Benefit? Not Anymore.\nIn a reversal of one of the most familiar patterns in American politics, it appears that Donald J. Trump, not President Biden, would stand to gain if everyone in the country turned out and voted.\n\nIn New York Times/Siena College polls over the last year, Mr. Biden holds a wide lead over Mr. Trump among regular primary and midterm voters, yet he trails among the rest of the electorate, giving Mr. Trump a lead among registered voters overall.\n\nThe pattern is the latest example of how the Trump brand of conservative populism has transformed American politics. His candidacy galvanized liberals to defend democracy and abortion rights, giving Democrats the edge in low-turnout special and midterm elections. Yet at the same time, early polls suggest, many less engaged and infrequent voters have grown deeply dissatisfied with Mr. Biden.\n\nThe disengaged voters do not necessarily like Mr. Trump, the polling shows. But they\u2019re motivated by pocketbook issues, more desiring of fundamental changes to the political system, and far less concerned about democracy as an issue in the election. Many low-turnout voters \u2014 notably including many who consider themselves Democrats \u2014 now say they\u2019ll back Mr. Trump.\n\nThis unusual turnout dynamic is one of the central forces shaping the 2024 campaign. It helps explain why recent polls and election results seem so divergent, and why Mr. Trump has gained among young and nonwhite voters, who are less likely to vote than older white voters. It creates a challenge for the campaigns, who are finding that time-tested strategies for mobilizing irregular voters may not work quite the same way as they did in the past.\n\nWith five months to go until the election, there\u2019s still time for less engaged voters to tune in and swing back toward Mr. Biden. Many infrequent voters aren\u2019t yet tuned into the race, and their preferences appear highly volatile. If the polls are right, they\u2019ve swung 20 percentage points since 2020, but some changed their answers when re-interviewed in the wake of Mr. Trump\u2019s felony conviction in New York. Even if Mr. Trump holds his edge among the disengaged, it\u2019s not clear many of these low-turnout voters will ultimately show up to vote.",

        "text": "Claudia De la Cruz\nAmerican community organizer and activist\n\nClaudia De la Cruz (born 1980/1981)[1] is a far-left[2] American community organizer and activist. She was the Party for Socialism and Liberation nominee for President of the United States in the 2024 election.[3]\n\nEarly life and education [ edit ]\n\nDe la Cruz was born in the South Bronx to immigrants from the Dominican Republic.[1][3][4] She attended Theodore Roosevelt High School, graduating in 1997.[1] A visit to Cuba at the age of 17 inspired her opposition to imperialism.[5]\n\nIn 2001, De la Cruz earned a bachelor's degree in forensic psychology from the John Jay College of Criminal Justice.[1] In 2007, she earned a master's degree in social work from Columbia University, and a master's degree in divinity from Union Theological Seminary.[1]\n\nCareer and activism [ edit ]\n\nAt the City University of New York, De la Cruz coordinated a teen group to study resistance movements and march against the 2003 Iraq War.[1][5] In 2004, she founded Da Urban Butterflies (DUB), a Washington Heights-based leadership group for teens and young women of Dominican and Puerto Rican descent. The \"Butterflies\" name honored the three Dominican Mirabal sisters who were killed in November 1960 for opposing the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo.[1]\n\nDe la Cruz attended and later served as pastor of Santo Romero de Las Am\u00e9ricas church, a UCC congregation in New York City.[1][6] She saw that church as important to her \"social and political formation\"; she \"wanted to do community organizing from a faith-based perspective\".[1]\n\nDe la Cruz served as co-executive director of The People's Forum, an activist organization in New York City which she co-founded.[4][5][7][8] With the People's Forum, she has participated in numerous pro-Palestinian protests, including a \"Shut Down Wall Street\" event during the 2023 Israel\u2013Hamas war.[3][7][9][10]\n\n2024 presidential campaign [ edit ]\n\nLogo for the 2024 presidential campaign for the Party for Socialism and Liberation\n\nDe la Cruz announced her presidential campaign on September 7, 2023. She and running mate Karina Garcia are the presidential ticket for the Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL), a Marxist\u2013Leninist party, in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.[3][5] Their socialist policy program includes a pledge to support reparations for Black Americans, institute a single-payer healthcare system, end all U.S. aid to Israel, forgive all student loan debt, fully recognize Native American sovereignty and honor treaty rights, cut the U.S. military budget by 90%, seize the 100 largest corporations, expand public transportation, and use taxation to eliminate billionaires.[11]\n\nOn January 28, 2024, Claudia De la Cruz and Karina Garcia held their first in-person campaign event in Newark, New Jersey.[12] On February 29, 2024, De la Cruz participated in a presidential candidates debate hosted by the Free & Equal Elections Foundation, alongside Green Party candidates Jill Stein and Jasmine Sherman, and Libertarian Party candidates Chase Oliver and Lars Mapstead.[13][14]\n\nIn March 2024, the South Carolina Workers Party voted to place De la Cruz and Garcia on the state ballot for president and vice president.[15] In June 2024, De la Cruz gave a speech at a pro-Palestine protest that surrounded the White House.[16]\n\nFor the 2024 election, Democrats worked to keep De la Cruz and other third-party candidates such as Cornel West off of ballots,[17] while Republicans intervened to keep third-party candidates on ballots.\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\n\n\n",

The event featured Hollywood stars like George Clooney and Julia Roberts, as well as former President Barack Obama.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nLate-night host Jimmy Kimmel moderated a conversation with Biden and Obama, and the two presidents talked about the impact that Trump had on issues like abortion rights by naming conservative justices to the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cThe next president is likely to have two new Supreme Court nominees. Two more. He\u2019s already appointed two that have been very negative in terms of rights of individuals,\u201d Biden said. Trump named three justices during his term \u2013 Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanagh and Amy Coney Barrett \u2013 cementing the conservative majority on the bench.\n\nBiden, who flew to Los Angeles on the heels of attending the G7 summit in Italy, did not expand upon how the two vacancies on the court would come about.\n\nAt the fundraiser, Biden referred to a recent report about Justice Samuel Alito, whose wife raised an upside-down U.S. flag outside their home after some Trump supporters carried upside-down flags at the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol.\n\n\u201cThe idea that if he (Trump) is reelected, he can appoint two more, flying flags upside down\u2026\u201d Biden said. Kimmel asked Biden whether that would be the \u201cscariest part\u201d of a second Trump term. \u201cI think it\u2019s one of the scariest parts,\u201d Biden replied.\n\nBiden filled one Supreme Court vacancy during his term, nominating Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman to serve on the court.\n\nThis is the second recent time Biden has mentioned potential future vacancies on the courts. He told a campaign rally last month that he would name \u201cprogressive judges\u201d to fill vacancies. \u201cThe next president -- they\u2019re going to be able to appoint a couple of justices,\u201d Biden said in Philadelphia at the launch of an effort to court Black voters.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cLook: if, in fact, we\u2019re able to change some of the justices when they retire and put in really progressive judges like we\u2019ve always had, tell me that won\u2019t change your life when Trump justices are already gutting voting rights, overturning Roe, decimating affirmative action, and so much more,\u201d he said that event.",

        "text": "Why U.S. foreign policy may play a larger role at the 2024 national conventions\nEvery four years, in the summer leading up to the U.S. presidential election, the major political parties hold national conventions to crown their nominees, issue policy platforms, and conduct other business. These multiday gatherings of political elite are also media events designed to promote the parties\u2019 visions for the country, defend (or attack) the current administration, and rally their bases ahead of the November vote.\n\nREAD MORE: More Americans say foreign policy should be a top U.S. priority in 2024\n\nConventions tend to focus on the parties\u2019 domestic priorities, but foreign policy and national security issues regularly come to the fore, especially during periods of global instability or armed conflict.\n\nIn the elections since 9/11, convention speeches and party platforms have waded into the debates over terrorism, war in the Middle East, nuclear proliferation, the rise of China, and other relevant topics such as immigration, human rights, trade, energy, and climate change. Many of these topics have surfaced again in 2024.\n\nWhat happens at the conventions?\n\nContemporary conventions tend to be choreographed affairs intended to showcase party leaders, rising stars, and celebrity supporters to a primetime television audience.\n\nOver a period of three to four days, carefully crafted speeches and videos promoting a party\u2019s message are interwoven with official business, including the appointment of committee members and ratification of party rules, credentials, and policy platforms. Conventions culminate in the nomination (and acceptance speeches) of the party\u2019s presidential and vice presidential candidates.\n\nMuch of the suspense associated with many past conventions \u2014 particularly the mystery of who would win a majority of the delegates (and the nomination) \u2014 largely petered out beginning in the 1970s, when the parties opened up the primary process. This transparency has allowed presumptive nominees to emerge during the spring.\n\nHow does foreign policy factor into these events?\n\nThe foreign policy issues discussed and the priority they are given in convention speeches and party platforms mostly reflect the national and international dynamics at that time. During periods of conflict, especially when the United States is under threat, foreign policy and security concerns take center stage.\n\nIn 2004, after 9/11 transformed the international security landscape and tens of thousands of U.S. troops had been sent to fight in Afghanistan and Iraq, both parties led with foreign policy, laying out their plans to win the \u201cwar on terror\u201d and stop the spread of \u201cweapons of mass destruction.\u201d\n\nWATCH: The long-lasting impact of the U.S. invasion of Iraq\n\nOn the other hand, during periods of relative international and domestic stability, foreign policy and national security tend to take a back seat to kitchen-table concerns like taxes, education, health care, and jobs. For instance, both the Democratic and Republican parties relegated foreign policy to the bottom of their 2016 platforms.\n\nBut even during such cycles, parties raise foreign policy to the extent they can use the issue to criticize the opposition or laud their candidate, especially given the president\u2019s role as commander-in-chief.\n\nFor instance, during the 2000 Republican convention, retired General Norman Schwarzkopf, who commanded U.S. troops during the first Gulf War, suggested that the Bill Clinton administration had allowed the military to atrophy over the previous eight years. Days later, at the Democratic convention, the outgoing president defended his record, including his military and foreign policy achievements.\n\n\u201cWe are more secure, and we\u2019re more free because of our leadership in the world for peace, freedom, and prosperity: helping to end a generation of conflict in Northern Ireland, stopping the brutal ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and Kosovo, and bringing the Middle East closer than ever to a comprehensive peace,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nHow are policy platforms crafted?\n\nA platform is a written statement \u2014 some have run nearly 100 pages \u2014 that lists a party\u2019s governing priorities and policy prescriptions. So-called planks in the platform speak to particular issues. The document is drafted ahead of the convention by a group of delegates known as the Platform Committee, whose leadership is typically appointed by the respective party\u2019s chairperson. Platforms are often debated and amended in subcommittees before adoption, usually by the second day of the event.\n\nPlatforms can also attempt to sew together some of the cleavages the primaries opened within the party. Critics say the planks are often crafted to satisfy highly vocal blocs that do not represent the whole party.\n\nDo conventions signal the policy of an incoming president?\n\nPolicy platforms, much like candidates\u2019 pledges on the campaign trail, are not binding. While they may reflect the policy wish lists of the candidate and party, events of the day and the president\u2019s relationship with Congress play larger roles in determining policy. Still, platforms \u2014 and the internal debates that shape them \u2014 are indicative of the parties\u2019 often distinct worldviews.\n\nIs foreign policy a divisive issue at conventions?\n\nDifferent factions within a party, often supporting rival candidates, have locked horns at the conventions over certain foreign policy positions. At the 2016 Democratic convention, protests erupted after the final platform did not include language explicitly critical of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which runner-up primary candidate Senator Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., opposed.\n\nIn 2012, controversy broke out after the Democratic party platform circulated language that did not explicitly recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. (This became formal U.S. policy in 2017, when President Donald Trump moved the U.S. Embassy there from Tel Aviv.) The line was reintroduced the following day.\n\nU.S. policy toward Israel was also a hot topic on the Republican side that year, with elements within the party pushing the platform committee to drop language endorsing the so-called two-state-solution: \u201cWe envision two democratic states\u2014Israel with Jerusalem as its capital and Palestine \u2014 living in peace and security.\u201d (The amendment failed.) GOP delegates also sparred over defense spending, detention policy, and immigration.\n\nGoing back further, at the 1976 Republican convention, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger reportedly threatened to resign from the Gerald Ford administration following changes the campaign allowed supporters of California Governor Ronald Reagan, who competed against Ford for the Republican nomination that year, to make to the platform\u2019s foreign policy plank. The Reagan camp inserted a section called \u201cMorality in Foreign Policy\u201d that seemed to challenge the existing U.S. policy of d\u00e9tente. Ford won the Republican primary and lost the election to Democratic challenger Jimmy Carter.\n\nAnd, in perhaps the most notable example of an intraparty clash over foreign policy, Democratic delegates at the 1968 convention in Chicago split sharply over the so-called Vietnam plank in a draft of the party platform. Supporters of Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey and those of his liberal rival Senator Eugene McCarthy (D-MN) disagreed intensely over how and when to end the U.S. bombing campaign of North Vietnam. After some two hours of raucous debate, Humphrey backers won a vote rejecting the minority plank on the convention floor.\n\nWhat are the prospects for 2024?\n\nForeign policy appears set to play a larger-than-usual role at the 2024 conventions, with voters focused on the wars in the Gaza Strip and Ukraine, U.S. immigration and border security, and growing economic and security challenges from China. Twice as many U.S. adults listed foreign policy topics as major priorities in 2024 compared to the previous year, according to a December 2023 poll by the Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. However, these issues still paled in comparison to domestic economic concerns.\n\nSome international issues have caused rifts within the two major parties. On the Democratic side, the Israel-Hamas war has opened deep divisions in the party that could surface at the convention. Almost half of Democrats and Democratic-leaning people under thirty years old sympathize mostly with Palestinians compared to less than 20 percent of those fifty or older, according to a March 2024 survey by the Pew Research Center.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, the party\u2019s incumbent nominee, has strongly supported Israel and continues to provide the country with significant military aid, although his administration has been critical of the Israeli government\u2019s prosecution of the war and the high civilian death toll.\n\nWATCH: \u2018The Internationalists\u2019 explores Biden\u2019s foreign policy approach after Trump\n\nFissures also exist in the Republican party, largely based on how to respond to the war in Ukraine. Washington has provided Kyiv with more than $100 billion in aid since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. The aid initially had strong bipartisan backing, but support among some Republicans has waned as the war continues in its third year.\n\nIn November 2023, Gallup found that almost two-thirds of Republicans believe the United States is doing too much to help Ukraine. However, while a majority of Republicans in the House voted against the most recent Ukraine aid legislation, a majority of the party in the Senate voted for it.\n\nStill, it is unclear whether this issue will play out at the Republican convention as well; for the first time in more than 160 years, the party did not release a platform in 2020 and instead pointed to a list of bullets that then President Donald Trump released on his campaign website. Trump has said that he would not commit to boosting military aid to Ukraine if reelected.\n\nThe parties are less internally divided on other issues, such as immigration and the rise of China. With border encounters reaching a record high of nearly 2.5 million in fiscal year 2023, illegal immigration has become a top concern for voters in several swing states.\n\nBut while Democrats largely agree on policies that make it easier for immigrants to legally enter the country, Republicans tend to advocate for stricter border controls and more deportations, viewing illegal immigration as a national security challenge. On China, there is bipartisan support for some measures, including efforts to \u201cde-risk\u201d the U.S. and Chinese economies and support for Taiwan.\n\nThis article is republished from the Council on Foreign Relations.

        "text": "Muted mics, no props: CNN details rules for Biden and Trump debate\nThe first US presidential debate between incumbent Joe Biden and Republican rival Donald Trump on 27 June will include two commercial breaks, no props and muted microphones except when recognized to speak, CNN said on Saturday.\n\nThe rules, agreed outside the Commission on Presidential Debates, are designed to reduce fractious interruptions and cross-talk that have often marred TV encounters in recent presidential election cycles.\n\nCNN, a division of Warner Bros Discovery, said debate moderators Jake Tapper and Dana Bash \u201cwill use all tools at their disposal to enforce timing and ensure a civilized discussion\u201d during the 90-minute broadcast from Atlanta.\n\nAnother Biden-Trump face-off will be hosted by ABC anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis in September. The traditional October debate will not take place as part of the agreement between the two campaigns and television networks that cut out the commission following years of complaints and perceived slights.\n\nCNN said both candidates will appear at a uniform podium during the 90-minute debate, podium positions will be determined by a coin flip and candidates will be given a pen, a pad of paper and a bottle of water but cannot use props.\n\n\u201cMicrophones will be muted throughout the debate except for the candidate whose turn it is to speak,\u201d CNN said.\n\nThe network also said that during the two commercial breaks, campaign staff will not be permitted to interact with their candidate, and unlike previous debates there will be no studio audience.\n\nBiden and Trump, the two oldest candidates ever to run for US president, will be seeking the support of an uncommonly large swath of undecided voters who may only begin to pay close attention to the contest closer to the 5 November election day.\n\nBut with polls already narrowing in crucial swing states, the debates come with risks for both candidates with markedly different styles of governance \u2013 on a seasoned senator who relies on an extensive staff for policy positions, and a New York developer-turned-reality TV star who shoots from the hip.\n\nAccording to a Reuters/Ipsos poll earlier this month, Biden is losing support among voters without college degrees, a large group that includes Black people, Hispanic women, young voters and suburban women.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Trump\u2019s team has indicated that immigration, public safety and inflation are his key issues.\n\nThe hosting networks will be keen to ensure that the twin debates will run more smoothly than in 2020, when the discussion focused on Trump\u2019s pandemic response and moderator Chris Wallace had to step in to remind the candidates he was asking the questions.\n\nThe second scheduled debate set for October did not take place due to Trump\u2019s Covid-19 diagnosis and his refusal to appear remotely rather than in person. In this election cycle, both candidates have refused to debate rivals for their party\u2019s nomination.\n\nCNN said that candidates eligible to participate must appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to reach the 270 electoral vote threshold needed to win and receive at least 15% in four separate national polls.\n\nIt said it was \u201cnot impossible\u201d that the independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr, could still qualify, saying he has received at least 15% in three qualifying polls to date and has qualified for the ballot in six states, making him eligible for 89 electoral college votes.\n\nThe Kennedy campaign said on Saturday that its polling showed he was now in second place alongside Biden in Utah, but behind Trump, and that he outpaces Biden and Trump among independents nationally.\n\nReuters contributed to this story",

        "text": "G7 leaders put on good show of unity, but look fragile at home\nGroup took strong lines on confronting Russia and China, but is its relevance in today\u2019s world on the wane?\n\nFasano, Italy \u2013 This year\u2019s G7 summit bore the hallmarks of a fragile club, yet one that still manages to put up a good fight when it comes to shielding Western interests.\n\nOn Saturday, the leaders of what were once the wealthiest countries in the world concluded the three-day G7 summit in Borgo Egnazia, a luxury resort nestled in the hills of Italy\u2019s southern region of Puglia. But the group\u2019s authority in global politics was overshadowed by trouble back home for most of its members.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s party took such a pounding at the European Union parliament elections last week that he called snap elections. In Germany, Chancellor Olaf Scholtz\u2019s Social Democratic Party also suffered in the EU elections to the point that critics have called on him to follow Macron\u2019s example.\n\nUnited Kingdom Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is already heading to the polls in early July for an election that most predict will see the end of his government, in a landslide victory for opposition party Labour, while the approval rating of Canada\u2019s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has plunged to a dismal 38 percent. And in Japan, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida\u2018s party has been mired in the throes of a political crisis since last year with some labelling the leader as Japan\u2019s most unpopular premier since 1947.\n\nAbove all, the spectre of November\u2019s United States presidential election has loomed large over this G7 summit, with the prospect of a comeback for Donald Trump, a former president who is openly sceptical of Washington\u2019s multilateral agreements.\n\nDespite the domestic challenges faced by G7 leaders, however, the group still managed to pull together a strong message of unity when it came to addressing the threats they see as undermining Western stability. Most significant was the announcement on Thursday that it will draw on frozen Russian assets to make a $50bn loan to Ukraine to support its efforts in the continuing war with Russia.\n\n\u201cThe G7 projected an image of weakness and of failing political authority,\u201d said Ettore Greco, vice director of Instituto Affari Internazionali. \u201cBut they performed very well on important dossiers such as Ukraine, Gaza and China, something that signals a clear convergence among them and sends a message of unity.\u201d\n\nTarget number one was Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin. As well as the loan to Ukraine, one day before the summit began, the US announced a robust new round of sanctions against Russian entities and individuals. On the sidelines of the event, US President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed an historic 10-year security pact, while a similar deal was signed between Ukraine and Japan.\n\nThe thorny issue of how to tackle growing global economic competition from China has also seen European allies moving closer to the US, which has traditionally taken a more confrontational line towards Beijing than they have. In an unprecedented move this week, the European Union hit China with tariffs up to almost 50 percent on Chinese electric vehicles, marking a big change in its trade policy. The US did the same in May.\n\nDemonstrating their unity on this subject, the G7 leaders expressed their concerns about \u201cChina\u2019s persistent industrial targeting and comprehensive non-market policies and practices that are leading to global spillovers, market distortions and harmful overcapacity in a growing range of sectors, undermining our workers, industries, and economic resilience and security\u201d in a final statement issued by all G7 governments at the end of the summit.\n\nAbsent from this year\u2019s final communique is the word \u201cabortion\u201d \u2013 a likely win for Meloni\u2019s far-right party which opposes it. By contrast, the final statement of last year\u2019s summit in Japan specifically called for \u201caccess to safe and legal abortion\u201d. This year, the concluding statement mentions only \u201ccomprehensive sexual and reproductive health and rights for all\u201d.\n\nShedding the \u2018elitist\u2019 veneer\n\nAnd, while the club did manage to pull together over shared concerns, it was less obvious if it has succeeded in shedding its elitist image and becoming more inclusive of other countries \u2013 particularly those in the Global South \u2013 one of the key stated goals of this year\u2019s summit.\n\nHosting the summit, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni invited a large number of guests including heads of state of India, Turkey, Brazil and the United Arab Emirates. Even Pope Francis made an appearance \u2013 a first for a pontiff. In part, these invitations reflect Meloni\u2019s political ambitions in Africa and the Mediterranean, but were also designed to broaden the outreach of the club, often accused of being too Western and exclusive.\n\nOn Meloni\u2019s mind, as well as those of the other G7 members, is the knowledge that the group cannot address world problems or confront threats from China and Russia by just talking to each other.\n\nThe question remains, however; just how attractive is the G7 these days to outsiders? Questions about the group\u2019s legitimacy are not new. The G7 used to account for 70 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 a figure that has shrunk to just 40 today \u2013 while representing one-tenth of the global population. In a sign that global power dynamics are shifting dramatically, other global groups are growing. The BRICS countries \u2013 which include India, Russia and China \u2013 have doubled in number of members from five to 10 as of January this year.\n\nFurthermore, protectionist policies and sanctions \u2013 two key elements which signified unity between G7 members this summit \u2013 are a primary source of pain for others.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons why many countries are watching rather than acting is because a lot of these Western nations are taking action that hurt their economies,\u201d said Fredrik Erixon, an economist and director of the European Centre for International Political Economy. \u201cNone of these Western leaders have the capacity to say \u2018We want to open up our economy with them\u2019 and that makes it difficult for other countries to support Western geopolitical goals.\u201d\n\nThe war in Gaza has deepened the divide. Western nations have been accused of double standards in their unwavering support for Ukraine, compared with their much softer stance on Israel\u2019s conduct in the besieged strip where more than 37,000 Palestinians have been killed in eight months.\n\nIn its final statement, the G7 rallied behind a ceasefire plan outlined by Biden, stressing once again the group\u2019s support for a two-state solution, including the recognition of a Palestinian state \u201cat the appropriate time\u201d.\n\nThe statement said that Israel \u201cmust comply with its obligation under international law\u201d and \u201crefrain from\u201d launching an offensive in Gaza\u2019s southern city of Rafah. Yet, it stopped short of condemning Israel for its conduct during this war, which is currently being investigated by the International Court of Justice \u2013 the world\u2019s highest court \u2013 in a genocide case being brought by South Africa against Israel. There have been reports that Canada and France pushed for stronger language about Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza, but the US and Germany opposed it.\n\n\u201cFor many countries around the world, the G7\u2019s failure to adopt a stronger stance on the war in Gaza represents the starkest example of the West\u2019s duplicity,\u201d said Rafael Loss, EU security expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations.",

        "text": "Will Trump abolish income tax? Here's what US economy may look like if he wins\nThe abolition of US federal income tax would lead to a shortfall of $2.1 trillion in government revenues, according to an expert read more\n\nFormer US President Donald Trump has proposed abolishing federal income tax if he wins the US presidential election.\n\nTrump is the presumptive presidential nominee of the Republican Party and is running against current US President Joe Biden.\n\nWhile Trump has long called for tax cuts, he has now proposed a radically different plan for his presidency: the abolition of the federal income tax.\n\nIn a private meeting with Republican lawmakers, Trump said that he could abolish the federal income tax altogether and make up the revenue shortfall with hike in tariffs on imports of goods into the country, according to Yahoo Finance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe report cited a post on X (formerly Twitter) by Republican lawmaker Thomas Massie that said: \u201cTrump briefly floated the concept of eliminating the income tax and replacing it with tariffs.\u201d\n\nMost intriguing policy idea from the GOP meeting at the Capitol Hill Club this morning:\n\n\n\nTrump briefly floated the concept of eliminating the income tax and replacing it with tariffs. \ud83e\uddd0 pic.twitter.com/hw0k8gwlGa \u2014 Thomas Massie (@RepThomasMassie) June 13, 2024\n\nSeparately, in a meeting with business leaders, Trump has said he would reduce corporate tax from the current rate of 21 per cent.\n\nTrump\u2019s pitch to business leaders has come at a time when more and more American business leaders are supporting Trump. These leaders include those who had distanced and even denounced Trump a few years ago after the January 6, 2021 incident when a mob of supporters egged on by Trump attacked the US Capitol to overturn the results of the 2020 US presidential election.\n\nWill Trump abolish income tax?\n\nEven as Trump proposed to Republican lawmakers the abolition of federal income tax, it is not certain if he would do so.\n\nYahoo Finance noted that Trump has a tendency of making different economic pitches depending upon the audience he is addressing. It further noted that Trump could go ahead with both the abolition of federal income tax and the reduction of corporate tax rate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe report noted that while Trump told the business leaders he would cut corporate tax from the current rate of 21 per cent to 20 per cent, he has indicated that he could cut it to as much as 15 per cent.\n\nThe report suggested that the reason Trump did not suggest the \u2018all-tariff\u2019 plan for the economy to business leaders was that it would have got a cool reception as businesses would not be able to make cheap imports of raw materials or machinery from abroad under such a regime.\n\nHow will US economy be if income tax is abolished?\n\nUnder a second Trump presidency, the abolition of federal income tax would lead to a shortfall of $2.1 trillion in government revenues, said Investopedia\u2019s Editor-in-Chief Caleb Silver to News Nation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExperts have said this would increase the cost of living for average American families. The cost of living will rise for the common Americans as the companies hit from higher tariffs will pass on the cost to the customers \u2014 the average Americans. This would mean that common Americans could end up making up for the government\u2019s fallen revenue.\n\nWhile common Americans will not pay federal income tax, they would pay more to companies that are taxed \u2014 which would make up for increased costs from tariffs by charging more from customers. Silver said the taxed companies\u2019 \u201cfinancial burden would simply shift to everyday goods through higher prices, making the United States\u2019 cost of living rise astronomically\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrenden Duke, an economist at the Center for American Progress Action Fund (CAPAF), said that an average American family could see a rise of cost of living up to $5,000 a year, as per Newsweek.\n\nSeparately, Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman said the average tariff rate under Trump\u2019s \u2018all tariff, no income tax\u2019 regime would be at least 133 per cent. He said in a thread on X that while such tariff-based economy worked in the 19th century when the government was small, \u201cbelieving that we can go back to those days is just ignorant\u201d.\n\nExplaining how he arrived at the figure of 133 per cent tariffs, Krugman wrote, \u201cImports are about 14 per cent of US GDP. Federal income tax revenue (not including payroll taxes) is about 8 per cent. So you might think replacing it would require a tariff rate of 8/14 or around 57 per cent. But tariffs would raise the cost of imports to consumers, so we\u2019d import less, which would mean you need a higher tariff rate. But this reduces imports further, meaning a still higher tariff, and so on.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, through mathematical calculations, Krugman arrived at the figure of 133 per cent.\n\nWith an elasticity of 1, the estimate looks like this:\n\n\n\nt*14/(1+t) = 8\n\n\n\nWork this through, and the tariff rate is 8/6 = 1.33, that is, 133 percent. With a higher elasticity, it would go higher, maybe to infinity 5/ \u2014 Paul Krugman (@paulkrugman) June 13, 2024\n\nGet all the latest updates of US Elections 2024",

        "text": "Fact Sheet: DHS Announces New Process to Promote the Unity and Stability of Families\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced actions to promote family unity in the immigration process, consistent with the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s commitment to keeping families together. This announcement utilizes existing authorities to promote family unity, but only Congress can fix our broken immigration system.\n\nUnder current law, noncitizens married to a U.S. citizen may apply for lawful permanent residence through their marriage to a U.S. citizen. However, to apply for lawful permanent residence, many noncitizens must first depart the United States and wait to be processed abroad, resulting in a prolonged, potentially indefinite, period of separation from their U.S. citizen family members and causing tremendous hardship to all concerned. Consequently, these families live in fear and face deep uncertainty about their future.\n\nTo address this challenge, DHS will establish a new process to consider, on a case-by-case basis, requests for certain noncitizen spouses of U.S. citizens who have lived in the United States for 10 years or more; do not pose a threat to public safety or national security; are otherwise eligible to apply for adjustment of status; and merit a favorable exercise of discretion. If eligible, these noncitizens will be able to apply for lawful permanent residence without having to leave the United States. DHS estimates that approximately 500,000 noncitizen spouses of U.S. citizens could be eligible to access this process; on average, these noncitizens have resided in the United States for 23 years. Approximately 50,000 children of these spouses also will be eligible for this process. Noncitizens who pose a threat to national security or public safety will not be eligible for this process, as aligned with our immigration enforcement priorities. If a noncitizen poses a threat to national security or public safety, DHS will detain, remove, or refer them to other federal agencies for further vetting, investigation, or prosecution as appropriate.\n\nToday\u2019s actions build on unprecedented steps by the Biden-Harris Administration to strengthen family unity including by implementing family reunification parole processes for nationals of Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Ecuador; updating and modernizing the Cuban and Haitian family reunification parole processes; leading the Family Reunification Task Force to reunify nearly 800 children with their families who were separated; and establishing country-specific parole processes for certain nationals of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela (CHNV) who have a U.S.-based supporter.\n\nEligibility and Process\n\nTo be considered on a case-by-case basis for this process, an individual must:\n\nBe present in the United States without admission or parole;\n\nHave been continuously present in the United States for at least 10 years as of June 17, 2024; and\n\nHave a legally valid marriage to a U.S. citizen as of June 17, 2024.\n\nIn addition, individuals must have no disqualifying criminal history or otherwise constitute a threat to national security or public safety and should otherwise merit a favorable exercise of discretion.\n\nNoncitizen children of potential requestors may also be considered for parole under this process if they are physically present in the United States without admission or parole and have a qualifying stepchild relationship to a U.S. citizen as of June 17, 2024.\n\nIn order to be considered for parole, an individual will need to file a form with USCIS along with supporting documentation to show they meet the requirements and pay a fee. Further information regarding eligibility and the application process, including a notice in the Federal Register, will be published in the near term. USCIS will reject any filings or individual requests received before the date when the application period begins later this summer.\n\nUpon receipt of a properly filed parole in place request USCIS will determine on a case-by-case basis whether a grant of parole is warranted and whether the applicant merits a favorable exercise of discretion. All requests will take into consideration the potential requestor\u2019s previous immigration history, criminal history, the results of background checks and national security and public safety vetting, and any other relevant information available to or requested by USCIS. USCIS has strong processes in place to identify and address potential fraud, which will be applied here to ensure the integrity of this program.\n\nOther Action\n\nIn addition, DHS will join the Department of State in an effort to more efficiently facilitate certain employment-based nonimmigrant visas for eligible individuals, including Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients and undocumented noncitizens, who have graduated from an accredited U.S. institution of higher education. By clarifying and enhancing the existing process, the Department of State\u2019s policy will give U.S. employers increased confidence that they can hire the talent they need, and that they will be able to quickly get to work. DHS will implement the Department of State\u2019s policy update.",

        "text": "United States\nA year of sweeping job losses that some compare to the 2008 financial crisis has left US newsrooms hoping that heightened attention in a presidential election year will staunch the industry-wide bleeding. Meanwhile, publishers have been wrestling with how generative AI could help drive greater efficiency in the newsroom without damaging trust. New roles are being created to manage this process.\n\nThe US news industry shed jobs at a precipitous rate over the last year, with total losses of nearly 2,700 positions in 2023 \u2013 the grimmest year since the pandemic \u2013 followed by a wave of high-profile layoffs in early 2024. The cuts have hit iconic brands across the industry, from broadcast giants NBC News and ABC News, to Time Magazine and National Geographic, to major NPR affiliates like New England Public Radio, New York Public Radio, and Southern California Public Radio.\n\nNewspapers continue to be hit the hardest. The Los Angeles Times laid off 115 journalists to begin 2024, more than one-fifth of its newsroom. That followed a year in which the Washington Post cut more than 250 positions through a combination of layoffs and buyouts. Many regional papers, like the Dallas Morning News and the San Diego Union Tribune, saw major newsroom cuts in 2023.\n\nAmong digital-first venues, the non-profit Texas Tribune announced its first-ever layoffs in August, losing 10% of its newsroom. Vox Media and Vice Media both saw two waves of staff cuts in 2023; the latter then laid off \u2018hundreds\u2019 more in February 2024 and announced it would shutter its news site, vice.com. Business Insider, owned by Axel Springer, likewise announced an 8% staff cut to begin the new year. The revered music journalism site Pitchfork, launched in 1996, was restructured by parent Cond\u00e9 Nast and folded into GQ magazine.\n\nMeanwhile, a report from the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University found 2.5 local newspapers closed every week in 2023; that leaves more than half of all counties in the US with \u2018limited access to reliable news and information\u2019, the authors found. According to the report, by the end of 2024, the US will have lost a third of its newspapers since 2005.1\n\nTo help mitigate these trends, a coalition of 22 national funders and donors launched Press Forward in 2023. The national initiative will invest more than $500m over five years to strengthen local newsrooms, address inequalities facing underserved communities and news-desert areas, and support policies focused on access to news and information, among other goals. Public officials at the state and national levels have also introduced bills focused on supporting and sustaining local news outlets and journalists.\n\nGenerative AI is becoming an important tool for newsrooms. Some news organisations drew negative attention for their AI use, including Sports Illustrated, which published AI-generated articles accompanied with bylines and headshots of fake writers, according to reporting by Futurism. Earlier, the website CNET published more than 70 articles written using AI tools, some of which contained mistakes and were inadequately labelled.2\n\nThe New York Times has begun building a team to explore strategies for using AI in the newsroom, hiring Quartz co-founder Zach Seward as the editorial director of AI initiatives. A social media post from Seward referenced plans to hire a machine-learning engineer, a software engineer, a designer, and editors for the initiative. The Times also drew attention for its lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement. The suit alleges that the companies\u2019 chatbots were trained with millions of articles published by the Times \u2013 and now represent sources of competition.3\n\nThe challenges facing X (formerly Twitter) continue to mount, with a study from Edison Research finding that the platform experienced a 30% usage drop from 2023\u201324. More than a year after taking over as CEO, Elon Musk has eliminated the platform\u2019s blue-check verification system and outsourced content moderators, and many staff members have been fired, laid off, or have exited, including the head of Trust and Safety. In July, Musk tweeted that the company had seen a 50% drop in advertising revenue. In July, Facebook launched Threads, a text-based version of Instagram that drew 10 million users in its first seven hours and surpassed 100 million within days but has struggled to maintain that early momentum.\n\nCable news outlets have seen major shakeups over the past year, including the September retirement of Rupert Murdoch from the Fox and News Corp boards and the appointment of his son Lachlan to run the global media empire. New CNN chief executive Mark Thompson announced in early 2024 that the network would overhaul its morning programming, including transitioning flagship show CNN This Morning from a chat-show format to straight news coverage, amid viewership declines.\n\nJoy Jenkins and Lucas Graves\n\nUniversity of Missouri/University of Wisconsin-Madison",

        "text": "Voting in 2024 U.S. Federal Elections\nVOTING IN 2024 U.S. FEDERAL ELECTIONS\n\nYour vote counts! Did you know that many U.S. federal elections for the House of Representatives and Senate have been decided by a margin smaller than the number of ballots cast by absentee voters? All states are required to count every absentee ballot that is valid and reaches local election officials by the absentee ballot receipt deadline.\n\nFollow a few simple steps to make sure that you can vote in the 2024 federal U.S. elections:\n\n1. Request your ballot. Complete a new Federal Post Card Application (FPCA). You must complete a new FPCA after January 1, 2024, to ensure you receive your ballot for the 2024 elections. Submitting the FPCA allows you to request absentee ballots for all elections for federal offices (President, U.S. Senate, and U.S. House of Representatives) including primaries and special elections during the calendar year in which it is submitted. All local election officials in all U.S. states and territories accept the FPCA.\n\nYou can complete the FPCA online at FVAP.gov. The online voting assistant will ask you questions specific to your state. We encourage you to request your blank ballots be delivered electronically (by email, internet download, or fax, depending on your state). Include your email address on your FPCA to take advantage of the electronic ballot delivery option. Return the FPCA per the instructions on the website. The online voting assistant will tell you if your state allows the FPCA to be returned electronically or if you must submit a paper copy with original ink signature. If you must return a paper version, please follow the same instructions below for returning your ballot.\n\n2. Receive and complete your ballot. States are required to send out ballots 45 days before a regular election for federal office and generally send ballots at least 30 days before primary elections. For most states, you can confirm your registration and ballot delivery online.\n\n3. Return your completed ballot. While some states allow you to return your completed ballot electronically, others do not. If your state requires you to return paper voting forms or ballots to local election officials, you can do so free of charge at the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate. Place your ballot in a postage-paid return envelope or in an envelope bearing sufficient domestic U.S. postage and address them to the relevant local election officials.\n\nBallots can be sent to the American Citizens Services unit by mail or hand delivery to U.S. Embassy Dublin, 42 Elgin Road, Ballsbridge, Dublin 4. You can also return your FPCA or ballot to your local election officials via international mail or professional courier service at your own expense.\n\nResearch candidates and issues. Please see the FVAP links page for resources you can use to research candidates and issues. FVAP regularly sends information about election dates and deadlines through their Voting Alerts. Email vote@fvap.gov to subscribe or follow FVAP on Facebook or Twitter.\n\nLearn more at the Federal Voting Assistance Program\u2019s (FVAP) website, FVAP.gov. If you have any questions about registering to vote overseas, please contact U.S. Embassy Dublin\u2019s Voting Assistance Officer at votedublin@state.gov.\n\nIf you would like to unsubscribe from STEP and no longer receive these emails, please click here.",

        "text": "The Economist\u2019s US presidential forecast gives Joe Biden a 34% chance of staving off a second Trump term\nToday The Economist launched its statistical forecast model for the 2024 US presidential election, which, at the moment, gives Joe Biden a 34% chance of holding on to the presidency.\n\nMr Biden trails in polling averages in all six plausibly decisive states, with deficits ranging from one to six percentage points. In the two where he is closest, Wisconsin and Michigan, Democratic candidates\u2019 margins have under-performed the final polls by an average of six percentage points during the past two elections. And even if he wins both, he would still need one more swing state to secure the 270 electoral votes necessary for re-election.\n\n\u201cOur 2024 forecast deploys rigorous statistical methods, but ultimately reflects the data that go into it. Donald Trump leads polls nationally and in every swing state. Unless and until that changes, the model will make Trump at least a narrow favorite,\u201d said Dan Rosenheck, data editor.\n\nAs of June 12th, The Economist forecast model suggests:\n\nBiden is slightly more likely to gain ground on Trump during the next five months than to lose it\n\nOn average, the model predicts Biden to pick up half a percentage point nationwide, yielding a tie in the popular vote\n\nBiden has a 24% chance of holding on to Georgia, where his lost popularity with black voters is most damaging, and a 31% and 36% chance in Arizona and Nevada, respectively\n\nRead Dan Rosenheck\u2019s\u2019 analysis of The Economist\u2019s forecast model here: https://www.economist.com/US-forecast-analysis\n\nTo interview an editor or to find out more about the forecast, please contact: Tom Amos [email protected]\n\nAbout The Economist\n\nWith rigorous reporting, in-depth analysis and global perspective, The Economist explains today\u2019s most important events and seeks to discern the trends that will shape the future.

        "text": "Trump endorses Dahlstrom for Alaska\u2019s U.S. House seat, criticizes Peltola and Begich \u2022 Alaska Beacon\nFormer President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president in this year\u2019s elections, has endorsed Lt. Gov. Nancy Dahlstrom in this year\u2019s race for Alaska\u2019s lone U.S. House seat.\n\nTrump\u2019s endorsement was among nine similar statements about different candidates posted on Truth Social, his preferred social media platform, on Monday afternoon.\n\nThe statement praised Dahlstrom and criticized both Democratic incumbent Mary Peltola and fellow Republican challenger Nick Begich.\n\nPeltola\u2019s campaign spokesperson declined to comment on the endorsement. Begich did not have an immediate comment.\n\nTrump\u2019s endorsement could aid Dahlstrom in her effort to win the votes of skeptical Republicans.\n\nAt April\u2019s Republican state convention in Anchorage, Begich received more applause than Dahlstrom, and an informal straw poll conducted by Must Read Alaska \u2014 a conservative website \u2014 indicated significantly more support for Begich than Dahlstrom.\n\nTwelve candidates, including multiple Republicans, are currently registered for Alaska\u2019s U.S. House race, and the state\u2019s primary election, which will narrow the field to four, will take place Aug. 20. The general election will be Nov. 5.\n\nHow Alaska votes In Alaska\u2019s election system, all candidates for an office, regardless of political party, are placed in the same primary election. Voters pick one candidate, and the four candidates with the most votes advance to the general election. In the general election, voters are asked to rank the candidates in order of preference, one through four, with a fifth option for a write-in, if wanted. If a candidate receives more than half of the first-preference votes, they win. If no one receives more than half of the first-preference votes, the lowest finisher is eliminated, and voters who picked that candidate have their votes go for their second preference. The elimination process continues until one candidate has more than half of the votes. Presidential elections do not have a top-four primary. Voters in November may be asked to rank more than four candidates.\n\nTrump remains popular among Republicans after his conviction in New York on 34 counts of falsifying business records. Both Dahlstrom and Begich said after the verdict that they stand behind the president.\n\nIn a written statement, Dahlstrom thanked the former president for Monday\u2019s endorsement.\n\n\u201cNow more than ever, we need real conservative leadership in Washington to right the ship and I look forward to working with President Trump to Make America Great Again when we\u2019re both in Washington,\u201d the statement said in part.\n\nLast week, during a meeting with Republicans in the U.S. Senate, Trump said that if elected, he will restart oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nPresident Joe Biden\u2019s administration suspended oil leases issued in the last days of the Trump administration, and the issue has been subject to lawsuits since then.\n\nIn Monday\u2019s statement, Trump called Peltola \u201cvery unpopular,\u201d said her victory in the 2022 U.S. House race \u201callowed the Democrats to terminate ANWR (something which every Republican President since Ronald Reagan wanted, but only I got!),\u201d and said she is \u201cdoing a terrible job for Alaska.\u201d\n\nTwo years ago, Trump endorsed former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin for U.S. House.\n\nBegich, Palin and Peltola ran against each other in an August special election and in the November general election for U.S. House. The November race also included Libertarian Chris Bye.\n\nPeltola won both races, in part because half of Begich\u2019s supporters chose Peltola or no one, instead of Palin, as their second choice in Alaska\u2019s ranked choice general election.\n\nIn Monday\u2019s statement, Trump blamed Begich for Peltola\u2019s victory, stating in part that \u201che refused to get out of this Race last time, which caused the Republicans to lose this important seat to Mary Peltola.\u201d\n\nDahlstrom has been endorsed by the U.S. House\u2019s current Republican leadership, and Trump\u2019s endorsement came on the same day that Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, visited Trump at his home in Mar-a-Lago, Florida.\n\nAlso participating in the meeting was Richard Hudson, chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee, which has made unseating Peltola one of its highest priorities.\n\nJohnson said party leaders recruited Dahlstrom to run for office.\n\nAt the time Dahlstrom entered the race, Begich had been a candidate for almost a year.\n\nBegich has the endorsement of the House Freedom Fund, the campaign arm of the Freedom Caucus, a group of conservative Republicans who have criticized and occasionally opposed the House\u2019s current leadership.\n\nTrump\u2019s statement claimed Begich has \u201cDemocrat tendencies,\u201d but did not elaborate.\n\nBecause Republicans have a narrow majority in the House, Freedom Caucus opposition to Republican leaders\u2019 positions has occasionally forced those leaders to seek House Democratic support for key topics, including foreign aid and budgetary spending bills.\n\nThe Freedom Caucus has repeatedly urged a Republican-led approach.",

        "text": "1st Biden-Trump debate will include microphone muting, coin flip and more\nThe June 27 CNN debate will take place in Atlanta with no studio audience.\n\nWith less than two weeks until the first presidential debate, CNN announced the rules agreed on by both President Joe Biden and Donald Trump's campaigns.\n\nThey include microphone muting, a coin flip and more when the two candidates face off at the network's Atlanta studio on June 27.\n\nThe debate, which is being moderated by CNN anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, will run for approximately 90 minutes with two commercial breaks. There will be no live studio audience, one major change from debates past.\n\nBiden and Trump will stand at podiums decided by a coin flip. Their microphones will be muted unless it is their turn to speak, the network said, which is likely to limit how much the candidates can interrupt one another.\n\nCNN said they won't be allowed to use any props or pre-written notes but will be given paper, a pen and water.\n\nThe CNN debate is the first of two debates agreed on by the campaigns. The second will be hosted by ABC News on Sept. 10.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and former president Donald Trump Kevin Dietsch, Jeff Kowalsky, AFP via Getty Images\n\nThey were scheduled on May 15, shortly after Biden publicly challenged Trump to participate in two debates. The Trump campaign accepted but pushed for additional debates in July and August, which have not materialized.\n\nThe Biden campaign set out some conditions for the debate, including that they be conducted by news organizations, not the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, and should have no in-person audience to limit disruptions.\n\nThis month's debate, the earliest ever in a presidential race, comes before the Republican and Democratic conventions later this summer -- when both Trump and Biden will officially accept their party's nominations.\n\nOn Monday, the Biden campaign rolled out a new ad as part of a $50 million media campaign in battleground states. The media buy includes an advertisement highlighting Trump's historic conviction in his hush money trial.\n\n\"Trump approaches the first debate as a convicted felon who continues to prove that he will do anything and harm anyone if it means more power and vengeance for Donald Trump,\" Biden-Harris 2024 Communications Director Michael Tyler said in a statement.\n\nTrump's team pushed back against the ad, again claiming his New York trial was a \"sham.\"\n\n\"The contrast between President Trump's strength and success versus Crooked Joe Biden's weakness, failures, and dishonesty will be made clear on the debate stage next week, \" said Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt.\n\nABC News' Gabrielle Abdul-Hakim and Lalee Ibssa contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Former Financial TV News Analyst-Turned-Fugitive Arrested on Federal Indictment Charging Him with Defrauding Investors\nLOS ANGELES \u2013 A former San Gabriel Valley resident who was a frequent guest on financial television news programs then became a fugitive from justice after being accused of defrauding investors is expected to appear today in federal court after being arrested over the weekend.\n\nJames Arthur McDonald Jr., 52, formerly of Arcadia, was arrested Saturday at a residence in Port Orchard, Washington, and is expected to make his initial appearance today in United States District Court in Tacoma, Washington. He will arrive in Los Angeles in the coming weeks to face federal charges in this district.\n\nMcDonald had been considered a fugitive since at least November 2021, when he failed to appear before the United States Securities and Exchange Commission to testify after allegations arose that he had defrauded investors. Prior to fleeing, McDonald also appeared to have terminated his previous phone and email accounts and told one person that he planned to \u201cvanish,\u201d according to court documents.\n\nSince then, a federal grand jury in Los Angeles in January 2023 returned a seven-count indictment against McDonald. He is charged with one count of securities fraud, one count of wire fraud, three counts of investment adviser fraud, and two counts of engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from unlawful activity.\n\nAccording to the indictment, McDonald was the CEO and chief investment officer of two companies: Hercules Investments LLC, based in downtown Los Angeles, and Index Strategy Advisors Inc. (ISA), based in Redondo Beach. He frequently appeared as an analyst on the CNBC financial television news network.\n\nIn late 2020, McDonald lost tens of millions of dollars of Hercules client money after adopting a risky short position that effectively bet against the health of the United States economy in the aftermath of the U.S. presidential election. McDonald projected that the COVID-19 pandemic and the election would result in major selloffs that would cause the stock market to drop. When the market decline didn\u2019t occur, Hercules clients lost between $30 million and $40 million. By December 2020, Hercules clients were complaining to company employees about the losses in their accounts.\n\nSince McDonald\u2019s compensation for his investment advisory services primarily was based on a percentage of assets under his management \u2013 typically 2% of a client\u2019s total assets held by Hercules \u2013 the massive losses to Hercules clients significantly decreased the fees McDonald was entitled to collect.\n\nIn early 2021, McDonald solicited millions of dollars' worth of funds from investors in the form of a purported capital raise for Hercules but allegedly misrepresented how the funds would be used and failed to disclose the massive losses Hercules previously sustained. McDonald \u2013 an avid football enthusiast \u2013 stated that he planned to launch a mutual fund under the ticker symbol \u201cNFLHX.\u201d The losses to Hercules clients and the potential for litigation related to those losses jeopardized the success of that fund because any litigation would have had to be publicly disclosed.\n\nAs part of the capital raise, McDonald obtained $675,000 in investment funds from one victim group on March 9, 2021. He allegedly misappropriated those funds in various ways, including spending roughly $174,610 of them at a Porsche dealership. Approximately $109,512 was transferred to the landlord of a home McDonald was renting in Arcadia; and approximately $6,800 was spent on a website that sells designer menswear, according to court documents.\n\nMcDonald allegedly also falsely represented to clients that ISA, his other firm, was a registered investment adviser, even though he had withdrawn ISA as a state-registered investment adviser firm in May 2019. He also allegedly sent ISA clients false account statements, including for one client who invested approximately $351,000, later needed the money to make a down payment on a home, was informed by McDonald that much of the money had been lost, and never got his full investment back.\n\nAn indictment is merely an allegation, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.\n\nIf convicted of all charges, McDonald would face a statutory maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison for each securities fraud and wire fraud count, up to 10 years in federal prison on the monetary transactions derived from unlawful activity count, and up to five years in federal prison on the investment adviser fraud count.\n\nThe FBI and IRS Criminal Investigation are investigating this matter.\n\nIn September 2022, the SEC filed a civil complaint charging McDonald and Hercules with violations of federal securities law. On April 21, United States District Judge Percy Anderson found McDonald liable for a total of approximately $3,810,346, which represented his net profits gained because of the alleged conduct.\n\nAssistant United States Attorney Alexander B. Schwab of the Corporate and Securities Fraud Strike Force is prosecuting this case.",

        "text": "How Crypto Money Is Poised to Influence the Election\nRyan Selkis, a cryptocurrency executive, was eating dinner at Mar-a-Lago last month when he got an unexpected invitation: Former President Donald J. Trump wanted him to come to the stage and say a few words.\n\nMr. Selkis, who runs the crypto data firm Messari, was one of a couple hundred attendees at an event celebrating Mr. Trump\u2019s series of nonfungible tokens, the digital collectibles known as NFTs. When he reached the lectern, Mr. Selkis turned to face the former president.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s 50 million crypto holders in the U.S.,\u201d the executive declared. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of voters.\u201d\n\nThat message has become a political talking point in the crypto world, as the industry tries to shake off a wave of scandals and establish itself as a powerful force in the 2024 election cycle. Three large crypto firms have banded together to finance a group of affiliated super PACs, investing about $150 million to elect pro-crypto candidates in congressional races.\n\nThe PACs are not planning to participate in the presidential election, a spokesman for the groups said. But top crypto executives have tried to mobilize the industry behind Mr. Trump, who has reciprocated by praising digital currencies and hosting executives at Mar-a-Lago.",

        "text": "Cryptocurrency Market News: Bitcoin Creeps Up But Still Under $70K\nKey Takeaways The bitcoin price fell last week ahead of inflation and Federal Reserve news but did not rebound as much as other risk assets.\n\nU.S. presidential candidates Donald Trump and Joe Biden continue to show that crypto is a notable election issue.\n\nTerraform Labs agreed to a $4.5 billion settlement with the SEC.\n\nBinance founder Changepeng Zhao was found to be one of the richest 25 people in the world.\n\nThis week, crypto analysts are watching the bitcoin price closely to see whether the recent volatility is over.\n\nThe past week has been a wild ride for the price bitcoin (BTC).\n\nThe price of bitcoin fell below $67,000 on Tuesday ahead of May inflation data and the Federal Reserve's meeting. Bitcoin regained some ground on Wednesday before tumbling again on Friday. While other risk assets such as stocks bounced back on cooler-than-expected inflation data, bitcoin failed to claw back the losses.\n\nDespite bitcoin's performance last week, crypto is having a moment on the U.S. presidential election campaign trail. Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump met with bitcoin miners last week and a leaked email showed members of President Joe Biden's adminstration will meet with members of the crypto community.\n\nElsewhere, Terraform Labs has agreed to a massive $4.5 billion settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the TerraUSD stablecoin disaster from 2022, and an investigative report concluded that Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao is one of the top 25 richest people in the world.\n\nCrypto Growing as a U.S. Presidential Election Issue\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has shifted his stance on cryptocurrencies during the current election cycle, now actively courting the crypto community to gain an edge over rivals Joe Biden and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nAfter meeting with bitcoin miners at his Mar-a-Lago estate, Trump urged cryptocurrency enthusiasts on his Truth Social platform to \"vote for Trump,\" positioning himself as a defender against what he calls \"Biden's hatred of Bitcoin.\"\n\n\n\nThis new approach follows Trump's previous strong criticism of cryptocurrencies during his presidency, where he labeled them as highly volatile and unregulated assets that facilitate illegal activities. Now, however, Trump's campaign has announced plans to accept cryptocurrency donations, aiming to mobilize a \"crypto army\" to secure his election victory.\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, the Biden Administration's approach to Bitcoin and crypto has come under fire, especially with a recent veto on legislation supporting crypto custody by financial institutions and proposed taxes on Bitcoin mining. According to a report in The Block, Biden is also expected to start accepting campaign contributions via crypto.\n\nPeople in Biden's camp will reportedly be attending a Bitcoin and blockchain roundtable next month, according to Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nTerraform Labs Agrees to $4.5 Billion SEC Settlement\n\nLast Wednesday, a court filing revealed that Terraform Labs consented to a nearly $4.5 billion settlement to resolve a lawsuit from the SEC. The filing requested court approval for the settlement, which would put an end to a legal battle over the company's role in the dramatic failure of TerraUSD in May 2022 that led to an estimated $40 billion loss for investors.\n\n\n\nThe settlement comprises roughly $3.5 billion in disgorgement, over $460 million in prejudgment interest, and $420 million as a civil penalty. Former CEO Do Kwon will also personally contribute over $200 million to the Terraform bankruptcy estate and is barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.\n\nThis agreement, originally reached ahead of a May 29 hearing, aims to impose substantial financial remedies and facilitate swift recovery for investors. The SEC highlighted that these penalties are intended to deter future fraudulent activities in the cryptocurrency market. Terraform Labs declared bankruptcy earlier this year, just before its trial with the SEC, where it was found guilty of defrauding investors.\n\nBinance Founder Changpeng Zhao Estimated to Be 24th Richest Person in the World\n\nSince his imprisonment, Binance founder Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao has seen a significant increase in his net worth.\n\nForbes now estimates Zhao\u2019s fortune is $61 billion, making him the world's 24th richest person.\n\nThis rise comes from his 90% stake in Binance, valued at $33 billion. Zhao stepped down as CEO of the company in November 2023 as a result of a plea deal with the U.S. Department of Justice. Despite the company's legal challenges and a $4.3 billion fine, Zhao's personal financial impact was limited to a $50 million fine. Since then, Binance has continued to grow, with its market share rising to 42% from 38% before Zhao's departure.\n\n\n\nA major boost to Zhao\u2019s wealth comes from his holdings in Binance Coin (BNB). Forbes estimates he owns around 94 million tokens, which is 64% of all BNB tokens. Despite Binance\u2019s legal troubles, BNB has surged by 100% in 2024, reaching a market cap of $110 billion.\n\nBinance\u2019s initial coin offering in 2017 was undersubscribed, and forensic analysis indicates Zhao and Binance retained a significant portion of the unsold tokens. Currently, BNB trades heavily on Binance\u2019s platform, and the token's performance has continued to add billions to Zhao\u2019s net worth, even as he serves his sentence.\n\nWhat to Expect in the Markets This Week\n\nAll eyes are on the bitcoin price this week, as digital asset investment products, which include U.S.-based bitcoin ETFs, experienced more than $600 million in outflows amidst bitcoin's price drop last week, according to CoinShares.\n\nDespite the price drop, the notorious bitcoin bulls at MicroStrategy (MSTR) announced another $500 million convertible note offering for the purpose of purchasing more bitcoin before updating the offering to $700 million later in the week.\n\nWhile bitcoin has traded in a relatively narrow range this month, the crypto asset has been outperformed by several bitcoin mining stocks, as noted by a JPMorgan report. This is thought to be a response to Core Scientific's (CORZ) deal with CoreWeave related to artificial intelligence.\n\nThe SEC's approval of spot ether ETFs also now appears to be an issue of \"when\" rather than \"if.\" SEC Chair Gary Gensler indicated in a Senate hearing last week that the matter will be resolved over the summer. Additionally, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas gives a 50-50 chance that the approval will take place by July 2. Prediction market Polymarket puts chances of a spot ether ETF trading by July 4 at 75%.",

        "text": "In 2024, age is on the ballot. Here's how old all the candidates are.\nSeven candidates are still in the running for the 2024 presidential election, and with the exception of Chase Oliver, the other six contenders were alive when President Dwight D. Eisenhower was in office, can access a 401(k) without penalty, and are now eligible to collect Social Security.\n\nJoe Biden, 81\n\nDonald Trump, 78\n\nJill Stein, 74\n\nMarianne Williamson, 71\n\nCornel West, 71\n\nRFK, Jr., 70\n\nChase Oliver, 38\n\nThere\u2019s a minimum age to run for president, but there isn\u2019t a maximum, as evidenced by the past two commanders in chief. Both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump set the record for the oldest elected president during their respective terms.\n\nHow old is Donald Trump?\n\nThe GOP frontrunner celebrated his 78th birthday on Friday. Despite the narrow age difference of three years, he often criticizes Biden, suggesting that the incumbent is unfit to be president because of it.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nTrump\u2019s team continues to make Biden\u2019s age an issue in the campaign, saying the oldest president in U.S. history has exhibited signs of \u201ccognitive decline\u201d while \u201cwandering around\u201d during a photo opportunity at the G7 in Italy, as previously reported by USA TODAY. In actuality, Biden was giving a thumbs-up to a skydiver.\n\nCritics of the former president have also commented on his memory, as he repeatedly confused Joe Biden for Barack Obama during multiple speeches in the last year. He has also faced criticism for his meanderings and gaffes during recent speeches.\n\nHow old are the Democratic candidates?\n\nBorn on Nov. 20, 1942, in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Biden, 81, is currently the oldest U.S. president ever elected. If he wins in November, he\u2019d be 82 by the time he takes office and 86 by the end of his term.\n\nBiden must convince voters that he is more fit for office than Trump, who is just three years his junior, while combating low approval ratings that are worse among younger voters.\n\nDuring the last State of the Union, the president directly addressed concerns about being older. \u201cWhen you get to my age, certain things become clearer than ever before,\u201d Biden said.\n\nBest-selling author Marianne Williamson, born July 8, 1952, in Houston, Texas, is 71 and will turn 72 before the general election on Nov. 5. She relaunched her long-shot 2024 presidential bid earlier this year, focusing on \u201cjustice and love\u201d less than one month after dropping out.\n\nIn a February statement, she said she was getting back in to fight Trump\u2019s \u201cdark and authoritarian vision\u201d after earlier suspending it because she was losing \u201cthe horse race,\u201d according to Reuters.\n\nHow old are the third-party candidates?\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. is 70 years old. Born Jan. 17, 1954, in Washington D.C., he is the second-youngest presidential candidate this year. He was initially running for the Democratic nomination but switched to an independent in October 2023.\n\nKennedy\u2019s campaign confirmed that he was officially on the ballot in a handful of states, including California, Michigan and Utah. But he still faces a challenging and costly battle to be listed in all 50 states.\n\nHe has also faced criticism about undisclosed health issues after the New York Times reported that a dead parasitic worm was found in his brain in 2010. The doctor believed the short-term memory loss \u201cwas caused by a worm that got into my brain and ate a portion of it and then died,\u201d Kennedy said in the deposition.\n\nCornel West, the political activist, philosopher and academic, is making a third-party bid for president that is most likely to appeal to progressive, Democratic-leaning voters.\n\nWest, 71, initially ran as a Green Party candidate but said in October that people \u201cwant good policies over partisan politics\u201d and declared himself an independent. He has promised to end poverty and guarantee housing.\n\nJill Stein, 74, a physician who ran under the Green Party in 2016, is trying again in 2024.\n\nShe launched her current campaign accusing Democrats of betraying their promises \u201cfor working people, youth and the climate again and again - while Republicans don\u2019t even make such promises in the first place.\u201d\n\nStein raised millions of dollars for recounts after Trump\u2019s surprise 2016 victory. Her allegations resulted in only one electoral review in Wisconsin that showed Trump had won.\n\nWhile the Libertarian Party invited both Trump and Kennedy to speak at their convention in late May, it ultimately selected Chase Oliver, 38. Oliver ran for a Georgia state Senate seat in 2022 and garnered 2% of the vote.\n\nWhat\u2019s the minimum age to run for U.S. president?\n\nAccording to the U.S. Constitution, a natural-born U.S. citizen has to be at least 35 years old to run for president. To date, the youngest U.S. president was Theodore Roosevelt at age 42, and the oldest is Joe Biden, who took office at 78 and was the only president to serve in their 80s.\n\nReuters contributed to the reporting of this story.\n\nVictor Hagan is the Alabama Election Reporting Fellow for the USA TODAY Network.

        "text": "Biden preparing to offer legal status to undocumented immigrants who have lived in U.S. for 10 years\nThe Biden administration is making plans to announce one of the largest immigration relief programs in recent history, developing a policy that would offer legal status to hundreds of thousands of immigrants living in the country without proper documents, four people familiar with the plans told CBS News.\n\nA program being developed by White House officials would offer work permits and deportation protections to unauthorized immigrants married to U.S. citizens, as long as they have lived in the U.S. for at least 10 years, the sources said, requesting anonymity to talk about internal government plans.\n\nThe proposal, known as \"Parole in Place,\" would also open up a pathway to permanent legal status and U.S. citizenship for some beneficiaries by removing an obstacle in U.S. law that prevents those who entered the U.S. illegally from obtaining green cards without leaving the country.\n\nAnother plan being prepared by the Biden administration would streamline the process for so-called DREAMers and other undocumented immigrants to request waivers that would make it easier for them to obtain temporary visas, such as H-1B visas for high-skilled workers, the sources said.\n\nThe proposal is set to be announced Tuesday, according to sources briefed on the White House's plans, when administration officials are preparing to host an event to celebrate the 12th anniversary of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which shields roughly 530,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children from deportation.\n\nSome Democratic lawmakers have already been invited to Tuesday's immigration event at the White House, three congressional officials told CBS News, requesting anonymity to share private invitations.\n\nA White House official said no final decisions had been made. White House spokesperson Angelo Fernandez Hernandez previously said the administration is \"committed to taking action to address our broken immigration system.\"\n\nThe \"Parole in Place\" plan would be the largest immigration program for unauthorized immigrants since DACA, a policy that former President Barack Obama announced in 2012 as a \"stopgap\" measure to protect DREAMers in light of congressional inaction on immigration.\n\nThe policy would benefit a subset of the estimated 1.1 million unauthorized immigrants with American citizen spouses, as long as they meet the residency requirement and other rules. Overall, there are approximately 11 million immigrants living in the U.S. unlawfully, according to the most recent government estimate.\n\nThe move would further underscore an increased willingness by President Biden to take executive actions on immigration ahead of the presidential election in November. Just last week, Mr. Biden invoked his executive authority to enact a partial ban on asylum claims at the southern border, a move that has already been challenged in federal court by the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nJust like the border executive action, the \"Parole in Place\" program will likely face legal challenges, possibly from Republican-led states, which have filed multiple lawsuits against Mr. Biden's more generous immigration policies.\n\nThe program would almost certainly garner vocal opposition from Republican lawmakers, who have increasingly taken strong stances against \"amnesty\" for those living in the U.S. illegally.\n\n\"Biden's border is still in crisis and his latest idea is amnesty. This will invite more chaos,\" said Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, the lead Republican negotiator of a border security deal brokered by the White House and a group of senators earlier this year.\n\nStill, Mr. Biden has been arguing that he's acting unilaterally on immigration because Congress failed to pass that agreement, which was rejected by most Republican lawmakers. Political analysts also believe the \"Parole in Place\" policy could help Mr. Biden's chances of earning more support from Latino voters, especially those in mixed-status families that would benefit from the move.\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the federal agency that oversees the legal immigration system, has administered a more limited \"Parole in Place\" program for military families for over a decade. The policy allows some undocumented immigrants who are immediate relatives of U.S. service members or veterans to obtain green cards, without having to leave the country.",

        "text": "Chinese citizens grapple with Florida law that bars them from buying property\nCNN \u2014\n\nAfter his employer implemented a return-to-office policy last year, Jin Bian decided to cut down his one-hour commute time by purchasing a house closer to the office in Tampa, Florida. Then, he was told the purchase might get him prison time.\n\n\u201cThat was really shocking to me. It\u2019s just purchasing property,\u201d Bian, who is originally form Nanjing, China, said. \u201cOnce I learned that, I didn\u2019t even bother to look anymore.\u201d\n\nBian, a 31-year-old software engineer who has lived in the US for 12 years, is a recipient of an H-1B visa, which allows companies to employ foreign workers. For nearly a year, however, it has been a crime for him to purchase a home in Florida after the state\u2019s governor, Ron DeSantis, signed a law restricting Chinese nationals without US green cards from purchasing property in the state.\n\nBian and other Florida residents told CNN that the rules have fostered uneasiness and confusion among ethnic Chinese people living in the state. Some say the law has damaged their businesses, while others say they are considering abandoning Florida altogether. And the law underscores the heightened tensions between the two biggest economies in the world in a US presidential election year.\n\nBian said that lately, he had begun reconsidering his life in Florida. He isn\u2019t alone. Ever since Florida Senate Bill 264 went into effect on July 1, 2023, Chinese citizens without green cards face a felony charge and possible prison time if they purchase property in the state. Sellers and real estate agents can also be found liable under the law.\n\n\u201cWe feel like we\u2019re different from everyone else because of this type of law,\u201d said Echo King, a US citizen who was born in China and is president of the Florida Asian American Justice Alliance. \u201cWe feel like we\u2019re not welcome.\u201d\n\nChinese citizens barred from buying property in Florida\n\nUnder SB 264, citizens of Russia, Iran, North Korea, Cuba, Venezuela and Syria are prohibited from buying property within 10 miles of any \u201cmilitary installation or critical infrastructure facility\u201d in Florida.\n\nFor Chinese citizens without the permanent right to live in the US, specifically, the law goes a step further, barring the group from purchasing any property in the state.\n\n\u201cFlorida is taking action to stand against the United States\u2019 greatest geopolitical threat \u2014 the Chinese Communist Party (CCP),\u201d DeSantis said in a statement last year.\n\nThe law is currently being challenged in court, but several other states are considering similar laws.\n\n\u201cFlorida has gone far beyond what is necessary to combat the so-called CCP influence,\u201d said Clay Zhu, an attorney who has partnered with the American Civil Liberties Union to sue the state, challenging the law. \u201cWe think this is a form of discrimination based on race, based on national origin and based on visa status.\u201d\n\nZhu likened the law to past discriminatory laws like the Chinese Exclusion Act. He says there should be a distinction made between the CCP and Chinese nationals.\n\nThe law specifically bans the \u201cpurchase or acquisition of real property\u201d by \u201cany person who is domiciled in the People\u2019s Republic of China and who is not a citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States.\u201d But the term \u201cdomiciled\u201d isn\u2019t fully defined in the law\u2019s language.\n\nSusan Li, a 47-year-old small business owner in Orlando, Florida, who holds a green card, said she \u201creally felt the discrimination\u201d when she learned about the bill.\n\nLike Bian, Li had been searching for a new home when the law passed. Despite the fact that she is a legal resident of the US, her family decided to halt their housing search for fear of potential legal complications.\n\n\u201cI thought maybe it\u2019s too much to bother, so I\u2019m not looking right now,\u201d she said. \u201cNo matter if I have a green card or I\u2019m a citizen, I still have a Chinese face.\u201d\n\nHeightened fears of Chinese government spying\n\nThe controversial law comes at a time when relations between the US and China have grown increasingly tense.\n\nLast year, fears of the Chinese government spying in the US reached a fever pitch after a Chinese surveillance balloon was discovered over Montana and eventually shot down by the US.\n\nIn addition to allegations that Chinese-owned apps like TikTok are used for spying (which TikTok denies), US lawmakers have increasingly warned that Chinese purchases of agricultural land pose a national security threat. According to the US Department of Agriculture, China owns 349,442 acres of agricultural and non-agricultural land in the US, representing slightly less than 1% of all foreign-held land in the US.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese Communist Party, a dangerous foreign adversary, should not own Virginia\u2019s farmland,\u201d Virginia Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin said on social media last year. \u201cThat\u2019s common sense.\u201d\n\nTo Bian, accusations of spying are offensive.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re ordinary people. We don\u2019t talk about these political things,\u201d he said. \u201cI think 99.99% of people here just want to have a good life.\u201d\n\nFallout from SB 264\n\nTeresa Jin, a mortgage lender in Florida, said she no longer works with clients who are not permanent residents or citizens of the US, but the grey area around the law\u2019s definition of \u201cdomiciled\u201d has created uncertainty. Other lenders have agreed to close on deals that she previously rejected for fear of legal repercussions.\n\n\u201cThe law has caused us so much confusion,\u201d she said. \u201cIt definitely hurts business.\u201d\n\nZhu said that some mortgage lenders and brokers in Florida have even begun refusing to work with clients with Chinese passports \u2014 even if they are legal residents.\n\n\u201cPeople feel as if they are being treated as spies or agents of the Chinese government,\u201d Zhu said. \u201cIt\u2019s very unfair and also very un-American.\u201d\n\nJin, who is a citizen, said she plans to stay in Florida. But others are weighing whether they might be more comfortable living in a different state without a law like SB 264 on the books.\n\nLi said she will likely leave Florida after her daughter goes off to college. Bian said he has hope that the law will be overturned, but if nothing has changed in a year or two, he plans to move back to California.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think California will ever have this kind of law.\u201d",

        "text": "Trump allies working to flip Arab American votes in Michigan\nOne of Donald Trump's emissaries to Arab Americans is a Lebanese-born businessman who moved to Texas as a teenager, speaks Arabic, English and French, and recently joined the Trump family when his son married the former president's younger daughter.\n\nTrump made his first appearance in Michigan on Saturday since his \"hush money\" conviction. Trump hosted a roundtable at an African American church in Detroit before speaking at Turning Point Action's \"People's Convention.\"\n\nMassad Boulos has taken on the challenge of trying to convince a politically influential community angry at President Joe Biden that Trump is a better option. But many Arab Americans also note Trump has positioned himself as more pro-Israel than Mr. Biden and has made a series of comments and policy announcements that critics blast as Islamophobic.\n\nTrump has long put family members and their relatives in key roles in his campaigns and the White House. Boulos, whose son Michael married Tiffany Trump two years ago, is the latest relative to rise in Trump's political orbit as he uses long-standing connections in an effort to build support for the presumptive Republican nominee's 2024 campaign.\n\nSome Trump allies think they can capitalize on dissension within Mr. Biden's Democratic base over his support for the Israeli offensive in Gaza, where more than 37,000 people have died since Hamas' Oct. 7, according to health officials in the Hamas-run territory who do not give the breakdown of civilians and fighters. Mr. Biden faced a significant protest vote during the Michigan primary in February in areas with high numbers of Arab Americans, who are an important Democratic bloc.\n\n\"Obviously the No. 1 point that is of high priority within the Arab American community is the current war in the Middle East,\" Boulos said in an interview. \"And the question is, who can bring peace and who is bringing war? And they know the answer to that.\"\n\nSeveral of the people who have met with Boulos also point to Trump's statements about Arabs and Muslims. While president, Trump banned immigration from several majority-Muslim countries and questioned the loyalty of Muslim lawmakers serving in Congress. Now, as he campaigns for a second term after losing in 2020, Trump has at times criticized Mr. Biden for being insufficiently supportive of Israel and has threatened to deport pro-Palestinian protesters he labels as supporters of Hamas.\n\n\"I told Massad, 'This isn't about you being Lebanese and me being Lebanese,'\" said Osama Siblani, a publisher of the Arab American News in Dearborn. \"You can't just buy votes. You have to give something substantial to the community. And Trump hasn't done that yet.\"\n\nBoulos, who is of medium stature with graying black hair, square glasses, and a warm, friendly smile, is often complimented for his calm demeanor and humility \u2014 qualities not always associated with someone overseeing a billion-dollar conglomerate.\n\nBorn in Lebanon, Boulos moved to Texas shortly before attending the University of Houston and obtaining a doctor of jurisprudence degree. Boulos said he actively participated in Republican politics as a student.\n\nAfter graduating, he eventually joined his family's business of three generations and became the managing director and CEO of the conglomerate SCOA Nigeria, which specializes in the assembly and distribution of motor vehicles and equipment.\n\nBoulos has a background in politics in his home country, having run unsuccessfully for a parliamentary seat in Lebanon in 2009. He describes himself as a \"friend\" of Sleiman Frangieh, a Christian politician allied with the Shiite party and the militant group Hezbollah. Frangieh is currently Hezbollah's endorsed candidate for Lebanon's presidential vacancy.\n\nA supporter of Trump from afar since his first campaign, Boulos became more directly involved after meeting Trump at a White House Christmas party in 2019. At the time, Michael Boulos was dating Tiffany Trump.\n\nMassad Boulos has given no recent donations, according to campaign finance records. But in a trip to Michigan this month, he attended what he described as a \"private fundraising event\" with U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., U.S. Rep. Lisa McClain, R-Mich., and about 50 Arab Americans.\n\nBoulos assisted with the 2020 campaign, but his role has significantly expanded since his son married Tiffany Trump in 2022, especially as Arab American dissatisfaction with Mr. Biden presented what Trump allies think is a larger political opportunity.\n\n\"One less vote for Biden is a vote for Trump,\" said Bishara Bahbah, chairman of the group Arab Americans for Trump.\n\nBoulos maintains a \"very close working relationship\" with the group, Bahbah said.\n\nThe group, which says it is independent of the Trump campaign, has established operations in Michigan and Arizona, states identified as priority areas by \"people close to Trump,\" Bahbah said.\n\nA May meeting held in Troy, Michigan, included Massad and Michael Boulos as well as Richard Grenell, who was Trump's ambassador to Germany and is a key foreign policy adviser to the former president. Approximately 40 Arab American activists from across the country attended.\n\nWhile Arab Americans for Trump was involved in the event, Boulos said that it had primarily been initiated by Grenell. The gathering received mixed feedback, with some attendees saying it lacked substance and failed to address their concerns regarding Trump.\n\n\"Grenell didn't say what they would do, but he kept reminding us that when Trump was president, there was no war whatsoever and that he launched the biggest peace effort in the Middle East. But most Arabs and Muslims don't consider the Abraham Accords a peace agreement,\" said Khaled Saffuri, an Arab American political activist who was in attendance.\n\nGrenell tried to call Trump to have him address attendees by phone, according to multiple people at the meeting. The former president did not answer.\n\nGrenell and the Trump campaign declined to comment.\n\nJust over a week later, Boulos returned for another round of engagements. This time, he had several meetings with nearly 50 members of the Arab American community, alongside one-on-one sessions with individuals identified as \"high-target\" leaders by Mike Hacham, the coordinator for Arab Americans for Trump in Michigan.\n\nBoulos said his efforts so far have been \"more of a personal effort to reconnect with friends.\" He said he typically begins meetings by speaking for close to 20 minutes, laying out the records of the Biden and Trump presidencies. He then opens the floor for any questions.\n\nSiblani had a nearly two-hour meeting with Boulos, who was accompanied by Bahbah, the chair of Arab Americans for Trump.\n\nAccording to Siblani, Boulos argued that things were better for Arab Americans under Trump and that the world saw less conflict and fewer wars during his presidency, suggesting Trump could help resolve the Gaza conflict.\n\nBut when Siblani pushed back, he said that Boulos lacked \"facts to prove his claim that Trump is better.\"\n\n\"Massad is unable to convince people to come to Trump's side because he hasn't offered anything substantial to the community, except that his son is married to Trump's daughter and he has access,\" Siblani said. \"That is fine, but what we need is policy and what Trump will do.\"\n\nIn interviews, Boulos said that Trump \"respects and admires\" the Arab American community. He denied the existence of a \"Muslim ban,\" which is how many Trump opponents refer to his ban on immigrants from several majority-Muslim countries. Boulos argued it was actually \"extreme vetting from certain parts of the world.\"\n\nThe key messages arising from these meetings, Boulos said, are communicated to Trump. Boulos highlighted a recent social media post from Trump that promised to bring \"peace in the Middle East\" if reelected, as evidence. Boulos asserted that the timing of the post \"wasn't a coincidence\" but rather a response to \"listening to the community's concerns.\"\n\nTrump's statement, posted on his social media platform, Truth Social, on June 4, did not go far enough for multiple community leaders who met with Boulos.\n\nIn a statement, Trump campaign spokesperson Brian Hughes said the campaign is \"grateful that supporters of President Trump are working to communicate with this community.\"\n\n\"We share the belief that Biden's failed Middle East policies have brought death, chaos and war to the region. That failure led tens of thousands of Democrats to vote 'uncommitted' in Michigan's Presidential primary. The Trump campaign has and will continue to communicate to those voters and remind them that President Trump's policies in the Middle East brought that region historic levels of peace and stability,\" Hughes said.\n\nSome in the community still feel that there are other options than just Trump and Mr. Biden. Green Party candidate Jill Stein visited Dearborn this year to meet with leaders and recently had conversations with the city's mayor, Abdullah Hammoud, about the possibility of him becoming her running mate.\n\nHammoud, at 34 years old, is ineligible to serve as vice president. The U.S. Constitution requires both the president and vice president to be at least 35.\n\nOfficials in Mr. Biden's administration have also visited Dearborn to meet with local leaders and have maintained ongoing contact with them, including Siblani.\n\nAmmar Moussa, a spokesperson for the Biden campaign, criticized Trump allies' outreach, saying in a statement that Trump \"is the biggest threat to the Muslim and Arab community.\"\n\n\"He and his allies believe we don't belong in this country and Trump is openly speaking about allowing Israel to bomb Gaza without regard,\" said Moussa, who is Arab American. \"Trump and his campaign are racists and Islamophobes. Period. President Biden, on the other hand, is working tirelessly towards a just and lasting peace.\"\n\nUntil the November election, Boulos said he will continue to divide his time between managing his company and meeting with the Arab American community.\n\nHe stressed that he is solely driven by being a \"concerned citizen and a Republican.\" He has not contemplated a role in Trump's administration if the Republican were to win.\n\n\"I honestly don't have any thoughts about that at this time. I didn't give this any thought whatsoever, but definitely I do not aspire for anything,\" he said.",

        "text": "Statement of Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas on the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s Actions to Keep American Families Together\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas issued the following statement on the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s actions to keep American families together and to streamline a pathway for Dreamers to access waivers relating to high-skilled labor visas for which they are qualified:\n\n\u201cToday, the Department of Homeland Security is taking action to keep American families together and end the fear and uncertainty these families face when one spouse is a United States citizen and the other is undocumented. Many of these families have United States citizen children. The undocumented spouses who may benefit from our action have lived in and contributed to our country for an average of 23 years.\n\n\u201cOur Department will implement a process that will allow those qualified undocumented spouses who are married to a United States citizen and have lived in the United States for at least ten years to pursue a path to become lawful permanent residents without first having to leave our country for an indefinite period of time. This process will achieve family unity, one of our immigration system\u2019s fundamental goals. It will also boost our economy, advance our labor interests, strengthen our foreign relations with key partners in the region, further our public safety interests, and more.\n\n\u201cFurther, we will work with our partners at the State Department in implementing changes to the inadmissibility waiver process that will enable certain noncitizens who were educated in the United States, including DACA recipients, to access high-skilled labor visas for which they are qualified.\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s actions today will advance our country\u2019s interests. Yet, only Congress can achieve the enduring immigration reform that our country has needed for nearly thirty years. Only Congress can fix our broken immigration system in ways that will most effectively and enduringly achieve family unity, economic prosperity, border security, and humanitarian relief.\u201d",

About 50,000 noncitizen children under age 21 \u2014 whose parents are married to a US citizen \u2014 will also be eligible.\n\nIn a White House speech, Biden pitched the new executive action as a \u201ccommon-sense fix\u201d to the \u201ccumbersome\u201d system that is already in place.\n\n\u201cUnder the current process, undocumented spouses of citizens must go back to their home country, for example to Mexico, to fill out paperwork to obtain long-term legal status,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cThey have to leave their families in America with no assurance that they will be allowed back in the United States. So they stay in America, but in the shadows, living in constant fear of deportation without the ability to legally work.\u201d\n\nThe new measures, Biden added, would \u201cfix\u201d the problem without \u201cany fundamental change in our immigration law\u201d.\n\nTuesday\u2019s announcement comes as immigration continues to be a central \u2014 and divisive \u2014 issue in the lead-up to presidential elections in November.\n\nEarlier in the day, members of the Biden administration pitched the change as a boon not just to immigrant families but also to the country\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cThink about the stability this will bring to so many American families across the country,\u201d White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a Tuesday news briefing. \u201cThese measures will help keep American families together and allow more young people to contribute to our economy and our country.\u201d\n\nImmigrant rights advocates also welcomed the new pathway to permanent residency, though they encouraged the Biden administration to do more. According to the White House, those eligible for the programme have been in the US for an average of 23 years.\n\n\u201cBy providing this much-needed relief, the Administration has not only helped keep hundreds of thousands of families together, but also sent a clear and decisive message that immigrants are deeply rooted community members who help make America stronger,\u201d Kica Matos, president of the National Immigration Law Center, said in a statement.\n\nMatos added, however, that millions of people across the country are still waiting for a permanent solution to gain US citizenship.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s well past time for Congress to get the job done and pass a pathway to citizenship,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2757\ufe0fBIG NEWS: @POTUS plans to provide relief for some immigrants who are married to U.S. citizens. This much-needed relief will help keep families together & sends a clear message that immigrants are deeply rooted community members who help make America stronger. https://t.co/RbygItH1Lt \u2014 National Immigration Law Center (@NILC) June 18, 2024\n\nGuidelines for the programme\n\nTo qualify for the spousal programme, an applicant must have lived in the US for 10 years as of Monday and be married to a US citizen.\n\nIf their application is approved, the applicant would have three years to apply for a green card and receive a temporary work permit. In the meantime, they would be shielded from deportation.\n\nIf granted a green card, they could eventually apply for US citizenship.\n\nSenior administration officials said they anticipate the process will be open for applications by the end of the summer. Fees to apply have yet to be determined.\n\n\u201cThese couples have been raising families, sending their kids to church and school, paying taxes, [and] contributing to our country,\u201d Biden said Tuesday\u2019s White House event. \u201cThis action is a better way. It doesn\u2019t tear families apart.\u201d\n\nThe Biden administration received pushback, however, over the requirement that eligible spouses had to have lived in the US for at least 10 years.\n\n\u201cIt is a decade. You have to be here at least a decade to take part of this announcement that the president is making,\u201d Jean-Pierre confirmed to reporters on Tuesday.\n\nWhen asked about the 10-year cut-off, Jean-Pierre said that further reform required the cooperation of Congress.\n\n\u201cThe way to actually deal with this is to have a comprehensive immigration legislation. It is for Congress to do their jobs and to move forward,\u201d she said.\n\nAnniversary of DACA\n\nTuesday\u2019s White House event marked the anniversary of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) programme.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama and then-Vice President Biden launched the DACA scheme in 2012, another major legalisation effort that currently grants deportation relief and work permits to 528,000 undocumented people brought to the US as children.\n\nThe Biden administration on Tuesday also announced guidance to make it easier for DACA recipients \u2014 known as Dreamers \u2014 to obtain skilled-work visas.\n\n\u201cI want those who have been educated at US colleges and universities to put their skills and knowledge to work here in America. I want to keep building the strongest economy in the world, with the best workforce in the world,\u201d Biden said.\n\n\u201cThis step builds on other action we\u2019ve taken to support Dreamers, from defending [them] in the courts to expanding access to health care.\u201d\n\nFirst, President Biden pitches a bogus executive order to \u201ccrack down\u201d on illegal immigration. But the order still allows millions of illegal aliens to cross the border. Now, he\u2019s planning amnesty for hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens already here. Unbelievable. \u2014 Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) June 18, 2024\n\nA play for votes?\n\nImmigration is set to be a key voting issue in November\u2019s election: A poll earlier this year from the survey agency Gallup found that immigration had topped a list of key voter concerns, ahead of inflation and the economy.\n\nBiden faces a close race against his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump, who pursued a hardline, anti-immigration stance while in the White House.\n\nReporting from the White House on Tuesday afternoon, Al Jazeera\u2019s Kimberly Halkett said the administration is hoping the measure is going to \u201ctranslate into votes\u201d come November.\n\n\u201cWhat the official line is, is that this is going to boost the economy, that this is going to help the labour market, this is going to promote family unity,\u201d Halkett said.\n\n\u201cBut what the White House is really hoping is this is going to boost Joe Biden\u2019s approval ratings which \u2014 in many cases, on a range of issues \u2014 are lagging behind his rival, former President Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nGustavo Torres, executive director of immigrant rights group CASA, said Biden\u2019s announcement would energise Latino communities to get out and support him in November. \u201cThis is what our communities have needed to rally behind President Biden for re-election,\u201d he said.\n\nRepublicans, for their part, were quick to condemn Tuesday\u2019s announcement, with Congressman Jim Jordan saying Biden was \u201cplanning amnesty for hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens already here\u201d.\n\n\u201cUnbelievable,\u201d Jordan wrote on social media.\n\nTrump\u2019s 2024 presidential campaign also accused the Democratic president of creating \u201canother invitation for illegal immigration\u201d.\n\n\u201cBiden only cares about one thing \u2014 power,\u201d Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why he is giving mass amnesty and citizenship to hundreds of thousands of illegals who he knows will ultimately vote for him and the open-border Democrat Party.\u201d\n\nOverlaps in policy\n\nBut some of the president\u2019s critics, particularly in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, have expressed concern that Biden\u2019s immigration policies might hew too closely to Trump\u2019s.\n\nEarlier this month, the Democratic president signed an executive order that clamped down on the right to seek asylum at the US-Mexico border, which saw a surge in unauthorised crossings last year.\n\nThe move drew criticism from human rights advocates, who accused Biden of cowing to pressure from Republican Party legislators who have blamed him for the situation at the country\u2019s southern border.\n\nChelsea Sachau, the managing attorney for the Florence Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project\u2019s Border Action Team, told Al Jazeera earlier this month that the asylum restrictions would lead to ever-more \u201cdangerous circumstances\u201d.\n\n\u201cPeople will grow ever more desperate,\u201d Sachau said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen [with] other border policies that, when people are forced into desperate circumstances, they will be forced to make heart-wrenching decisions.\u201d\n\nBut Biden addressed the concerns in his Tuesday speech, saying the asylum measures were a reaction to deadlock in Congress.\n\n\u201cTwo weeks ago, I did what Republicans in Congress refused to do: I took action to secure our border. That included restricting unlawful crossings at our southern border, making decision on asylum more quickly and so much more. And so far it\u2019s working,\u201d Biden said.\n\nHe added that Republicans refused to advance bipartisan immigration reform earlier this year because they believed it would \u201churt\u201d Trump\u2019s re-election prospects in November.\n\n\u201cWe were about to move forward when Republicans walked away from the deal for the most pathetic and petty of reasons: Donald Trump got on the phone, literally,\u201d Biden told the audience.\n\nHe ended his speech by drawing a stark line between himself and Trump, whom he accused of \u201cproposing to rip spouses and children from their families and homes and communities and place them in detention camps\u201d.\n\nHe also called Trump\u2019s comments on immigration outrageous: \u201cWe\u2019re a nation of immigrants, and that\u2019s who we are.\u201d",

        "text": "Key dates to know in the presidential race as the 2024 election nears\nU.S. voters will head to the polls on Nov. 5 in just over five months to select their next president. The contest is proving to be highly divisive and closely fought, with Democratic incumbent Joe Biden and Republican frontrunner and former president Donald Trump expected to be the leading contenders.\n\nHere is a timeline of events related to the Nov. 5 election between now and Inauguration Day in January 2025.\n\nPrep for the polls:See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nSummer 2024\n\nJune 27th: Biden and Trump's first of two debates this election will be held in CNN's Atlanta, Georgia studio. The debate, moderated by anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, will not be in front of a live audience. Both candidates agreed to two debates in May, sidestepping the September and October dates already set by the Committee on Presidential Debates, which usually hosts three debates.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nJuly 11th: Trump will be sentenced in his Manhattan hush money trial weeks after he was found guilty on 34 criminal counts for falsifying documents to hide payment to silence adult film star Stormy Daniels, ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Trump is the first sitting or former U.S. president to be convicted of a crime.\n\nJuly 15-18: The Republican National Convention will kick off in Milwaukee, where the party will hand out official candidate nominations.\n\nLate July or August: Vice President Kamala Harris has agreed to debate Trump's not yet-announced VP pick on CBS on either of the proposed dates of July 23 or Aug. 13. Trump has accepted a vice presidential debate held on Fox but has not confirmed if his running mate would debate Harris on CBS. The Biden campaign has not said whether Harris would participate in a debate on Fox.\n\nBy August 7: The Democrats are scheduled to hold a virtual roll call to nominate Biden before Aug. 7, Ohio's electoral ballot certification deadline in Ohio.\n\nAugust 19-22: The Democratic National Convention in Chicago will take place, where the party will officially nominate candidates, including Biden.\n\nFall 2024\n\nSeptember 10: ABC will host the second and final debate of the presidential election year between Biden and Trump.\n\nNov 5: Election Day but results could take days, especially if it's a close call and mail-in ballots are a factor.\n\nJanuary 2025\n\nJan 6: Congress will convene in a joint session presided by the Vice President to count the Electoral College votes and declare the winner of the presidential election.\n\nJan. 6, 2021, proved to be a historic day when the U.S. Capitol was attacked by pro-Trump rioters attempting to stop the vote count. Both chambers of Congress later resumed their work and certified Biden's win.\n\nCongress has since passed the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act of 2022, which requires approval of one-fifth of the House and Senate to consider a challenge to a state's results \u2013 a much higher bar than existed before when any single lawmaker from each chamber could trigger a challenge.\n\nJan 20: The inauguration of the elected presidential candidate and their vice president will take place, where both will be sworn into office.\n\nReuters contributed to the reporting of this story.",

This is what campaigns want to pay the most attention to. What is going to work with voters? What do they care about? So, here's what we asked. These were the top three issues that we saw in our poll, preserving democracy, the top issue, 30 percent, inflation, 29 percent, immigration, 19 percent.\n\nSo, those top two very close, essentially. What does this mean? Again, the layer of context. Let's look at what the numbers were in February. Preserving democracy was also number one then with 31 percent.\n\nBut I want to call everyone's attention, especially, to that inflation number right there. Look at that. That's a big change. While preserving democracy is where it has been for a while, the concern about inflation actually has jumped up six points. That is above the margin of error.\n\nSo, that indicates there is actually rising concern about inflation right now. So, we often ask about the economy, about jobs. But it's not jobs right now. We know we have a booming job market. It's inflation. And we can talk about and we have talked about on air that, in general, in the United States right now, the truth is that inflation has been going down.\n\nThe Fed still has some concern, but we are way down from the record inflation that we saw last year and the year before. But voters in their lives are feeling it still. They are still concerned about inflation where they live.",

That includes undecided voters who are leaning toward one candidate. The survey had a margin of error of nearly 4 percentage points.\n\nThat\u2019s relatively unchanged since last month\u2019s poll.\n\nLee Miringoff \u2014 director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, which conducted the survey \u2014 said most voters have decided who they will vote for in the presidential election.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHowever, 9% of voters polled said they haven\u2019t yet made up their mind who they\u2019ll vote for. And another 25% said they have a \u201cgood idea\u201d who they would vote for, but \u201ccould still change [their] mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that this to some degree taps into the notion that there are still a lot of months to go,\u201d Miringoff said.\n\nThe first of two planned presidential debates is on June 27, and 6 in 10 survey respondents said they plan to watch it. Because the debates and party conventions have yet to happen, Miringoff said voters are more likely to tell pollsters that they are open to seeing \u201chow things play out.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s even if they do end up right back where they were,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause they interpret these events in ways that reinforce what they already think.\u201d\n\nIn particular, the poll found younger voters and nonwhite voters were more likely than other groups to say their vote could change. Among both groups, just about 55% said they know for sure who they\u2019re voting for.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe poll also found that Biden is making some inroads among independent voters. Biden\u2019s support among these voters went from 42% in last month's survey to 50%.\n\n\u201cThis may be the group that is most influenced by the results of Donald Trump's legal problems,\u201d Miringoff said. \u201cBut independents are very much more persuadable in the whole sea of things that are going to affect this outcome of the election.\u201d\n\nDavid North, an independent voter in Connecticut who participated in the survey, said he supported Republican candidates until eight years ago, but is also most likely going to vote for Biden in November.\n\n\u201cI think we have to go with Biden just because he's a regular, old time, slick politician that knows how to get things done,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just might not like what he gets done. But at least he's playing the game kind of by our traditional rules.\u201d\n\nThe poll found that while Biden is gaining an edge among independent voters, Trump is doing better among voters who disapprove of both candidates.\n\nPolitics President Biden and former President Trump face off in CNN debate next week President Biden and former President Trump face off in CNN debate next week Listen \u00b7 4:28 4:28\n\nMiringoff also said some of the more unusual electorate patterns in this race \u201care now starting to normalize\u201d a little bit.\n\nFor example, Biden had previously been overperforming expectations among white voters. But since last month's survey, Trump\u2019s percentage point advantage among white voters doubled from a 6-point to a 12-point lead.\n\nConversely, Biden is starting to improve his support among nonwhite voters. According to this latest poll, Biden (58%) leads Trump (40%) by 18 percentage points. The president previously had an 11-percentage point advantage among this group of voters.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn a broader contest, with independent and third-party candidates, Trump leads Biden, 42%-41%, with independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who\u2019s not yet qualified for CNN\u2019s debate next week, coming in third, at 11% support.\n\n\"What's been interesting and continues to be interesting is that Robert Kennedy, who gets the most votes of a minor-party candidate, is drawing from both of them [Biden and Trump] roughly equally,\u201d Miringoff said.\n\n\n\nWhat about Trump\u2019s conviction?\n\nA slim majority of poll respondents \u2014 51% \u2014 said Trump definitely or probably should serve prison time after his historic recent hush money conviction in New York. Forty-seven percent said Trump should definitely or probably not be incarcerated.\n\n\n\nWhat voters say about the issues that matter to them\n\nOut of a set list of six issues, a plurality of respondents (30%) said inflation is top of mind when they think about voting in the general election. That was followed by preserving democracy (29%) and immigration (18%).\n\nComparing Trump and Biden, most respondents said Trump would be better at handling the economy and immigration, while they said the same of Biden on preserving democracy and abortion.\n\nThe survey of 1,311 adults was conducted June 10 to 12 by the Marist Institute for Public Opinion. The margin of error for the overall sample is +/- 3.6 percentage points.",

This question is looming large on the Democrats , the voters as well as the US political system. This has become particularly important in the wake of the increasing number of incidents that raise questions about the cognitive health of the president. The debate was once again triggered after US President appeared to lose his way during a G-7 event in the Italian city of Apulia. Joe Biden Biden wandered off and started a conversation with an officer who was packing a bag. The embarrassing situation came to such a pass that Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni came forward and redirected the US president to his place among the other leaders.Will it be a wise decision for the Democrats to pin all of their hopes on 81-year-old Joe Biden? 'Washington Post' columnist Kathleen Parker has said that Hillary Clinton would extricate the US from its \u201cold-White-men dilemma.\" She added that though no one has mentioned the former US Secretary of State as a possible running mate for Biden so far, it should be considered to replace Harris with Clinton.In her most recent column, the Pulitzer Prize-winning- journalist wrote that the 81-year-old Biden had \u201csteady decline the past few years\u201d. It has been made more apparent through \u201chis stumbles, his search for words, his occasional blank stare\u201d. She also said that these are now \u201cimpossible to ignore.\u201d'The Washington Post' columnist has pointed out that neither Biden nor Trump would be eligible to run for Congress in North Dakota after the state\u2019s legislature passed a measure setting up an upper age limit for candidates. She said that if Kamala Harris is picked as the running mate, it would deter already-skeptical voters due to the vice president \u2019s \u201ccompetency, or lack thereof.\u201dOn the other hand, if Hillary Clinton is picked up as the running mate, it would instead reassure voters that if the need arises she would be able to step in for Biden during his second term. Cathleen Parker underlined the risk of losing the black votes, but that Democrats have earlier won the election and that their voters would back candidates \u201cpresumably to advance a worldview consistent with their values.\u201dHillary Clinton served as the Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013 during Barack Obama administration.

        "text": "Biden faces complex juggling act on immigration as election nears\nBiden is walking immigration tightrope - but he's under fire no matter what\n\nImmigration and the US-Mexico border are cited by many Americans are their primary electoral concern.\n\nUS President Joe Biden has vowed not to \"play politics\" with the southern border and immigration - a potentially tall order as the US hurtles toward the November presidential election.\n\nMr Biden's comments came on what he called a \"good day\" in which he announced an executive order aimed at protecting hundreds of thousands of undocumented spouses of US citizens from deportation and allowing them to work in the US.\n\nHis actions, however, have drawn criticism from Republicans and some fellow Democrats alike, forcing the president into a complex juggling act.\n\nPolls show that a majority of voters see immigration as one of the most important problems facing the country - a fact which makes Mr Biden's stated desire to be apolitical on the issue difficult.\n\nThe new executive action announced by the administration on Tuesday has been widely praised by immigration activists and Democrats alike, many of whom have lauded it as the most significant relief programme for undocumented migrants already in the US since the Obama administration announced the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or Daca, in 2012.\n\nThe chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC), California Democrat Nanette Barrag\u00e1n, praised the move as a \u201chappy day\u201d for immigrant families, who \u201ccan go to sleep tonight knowing their loved ones will not be going anywhere\u201d.\n\nBut the latest move stands in stark contrast to his sweeping immigration order issued in early June, which allows officials to quickly remove migrants entering the US illegally without processing their asylum requests.\n\nThe executive actions - spaced out over the span of just two weeks - have highlighted the complex tightrope that Mr Biden finds himself in with regards to the issue.\n\n\u201cBiden always finds himself in a hard place,\u201d Republican strategist Doug Heye told the BBC. \u201cWhatever he does is going to get criticism. This is a perfect example.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s underperforming with Hispanic voters, so he\u2019s trying to make a move to bring in a lot of votes. But it can cost him votes as well,\u201d he added. \u201cThat is, by definition, mixed messaging.\u201d\n\nThe asylum restrictions announced on 5 June, now the focus of a lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union, were widely criticised by immigration advocates and even some of Mr Biden\u2019s Democratic allies.\n\nIn a statement, the CHC called the order \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d and symptomatic of enforcement strategies that have \u201crepeatedly proven ineffective\u201d and created \u201cchaos\u201d at the border.\n\nSpokespeople for Donald Trump, Mr Biden's Republican challenger, condemned both actions as a move towards \u201camnesty\u201d for undocumented workers.",

        "text": "Catholics could decide the 2024 election\nThis combination image of two file photos shows then-President Donald Trump, left, and then-Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden during a presidential debate Sept. 29, 2020, at Case Western University and Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland. (RNS/AP/Patrick Semansky)\n\nWith the 2024 presidential election predicted to be very close, American Catholics could be the deciding voters in the election. Catholics are a significant voting bloc, almost evenly divided among Republicans and Democrats (though white Catholics tend to be Republican and Hispanic Catholics Democrats). Because they reside in significant numbers in battleground states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Nevada, they have all the more power to decide who will be the next president. All these demographic facts make Catholics a good weathervane, and indeed they tend to vote for the winner in presidential elections. If you win Catholics, you probably win the country. Catholics were once dependable members of the Democratic coalition. Beginning in 1928, they began voting Democratic when Protestant and Republican operatives smeared New York Gov. Al Smith, the first Catholic to run for president, with anti-Catholic propaganda. Catholics went on to support Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal, breaking ranks with the Democrats only to reelect Dwight Eisenhower to his second term in 1956. They reverted to form in 1960 and '64, voting for John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson, both Democrats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRichard Nixon was the first to recognize that Republicans had a chance of wooing Catholics to their party. By 1968, white Catholics had joined the middle class and moved to the suburbs. They were paying more taxes, and some objected to affirmative action and the integration of schools through busing. The bond with the Republicans was deepened by Ronald Reagan, who switched his stance on abortion to pro-life in an appeal to both Catholics and evangelical Christians in 1980. Today, Donald Trump appeals to the same nativist prejudices against immigrants that were directed at Catholics in the first half of the 20th century. That many white Catholics respond to this appeal shows how ignorant they are of what their grandparents and great-grandparents experienced. But many feel abandoned by the Democrats, especially working-class white Catholics in the Rust Belt who have suffered from factory closings. The Catholic bishops have tended to ally with the Republican Party, as they have made the abortion issue preeminent. Though Trump has changed his position on abortion numerous times, when it mattered most he appointed justices to the U.S. Supreme Court who overturned Roe v. Wade. But on issues such as health care, immigration, the environment and help for the poor, the bishops have been critical of Republican policies and supported Democratic programs.\n\nThis is reflected in their election-year document, \"Faithful Citizenship,\" which is strongly pro-life but also concerned for the poor. Sadly, it has not been updated to reflect Pope Francis' concern about global warming and the environment.",

        "text": "Half a million immigrants could eventually get US citizenship under a sweeping new plan from Biden\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden ordered expansive election-year action Tuesday to offer potential citizenship to hundreds of thousands of immigrants without legal status in the U.S., aiming to balance his recent aggressive crackdown on the southern border that enraged advocates and many Democratic lawmakers.\n\nThe president announced that his administration will, in the coming months, allow certain U.S. citizens\u2019 spouses without legal status to apply for permanent residency and eventually citizenship without having to first depart the country. The action by Biden, a Democrat, could affect upwards of half a million immigrants, according to senior administration officials.\n\n\u201cThe Statue of Liberty is not some relic of American history. It still stands for who we are,\u201d Biden said from a crowded East Room at the White House, filled with advocates, congressional Democrats and immigrants who would be eligible for the program. \u201cBut I also refuse to believe that for us to continue to be America that embraces immigration, we have to give up securing our border. They\u2019re false choices.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s action, which amounts to the most expansive federal protection for immigrants in over a decade, sets up a significant political contrast with presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, whose hardline stance on immigration includes a push for mass deportations and rhetoric casting migrants as dangerous criminals \u201cpoisoning the blood\u201d of America.\n\nOn Tuesday, Biden accused \u201cmy predecessor\u201d of preying on fears about immigrants as he chastised Trump administration moves, such as a zero-tolerance policy at the southern border that led to the separation of families. But Trump has leaned into his own policies as Biden has faced disapproval of his handling of immigration throughout his presidency. At a rally in Racine, Wisconsin, on Tuesday, Trump proclaimed, \u201cWhen I\u2019m reelected, Joe Biden\u2019s illegal amnesty plan will be ripped up and thrown out on the very first day that we\u2019re back in office.\u201d\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nBecause the shadow of a second Trump administration looms over Biden\u2019s new policy, Tuesday\u2019s actions will set off a months-long sprint by Latino organizations to get as many people to apply for the program as possible before next January.\n\nTo qualify for Biden\u2019s actions, an immigrant must have lived in the United States for 10 years and be married to a U.S. citizen, both as of Monday. If a qualifying immigrant\u2019s application is approved, he or she would have three years to apply for a green card and receive a temporary work permit and be shielded from deportation in the meantime.\n\nAbout 50,000 noncitizen children with parents who are married to U.S. citizen could also potentially qualify for the process, according to senior administration officials who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity. There is no requirement on how long the couple must have been married, but no one becomes eligible after Monday. That means immigrants who reach that 10-year mark after Monday will not qualify for the program, according to the officials.\n\nSenior administration officials said they anticipate the process will be open for applications by the end of the summer. Fees to apply have yet to be determined.\n\nBiden formally unveiled his plans at a Tuesday event at the White House, which also marked the 12th anniversary of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, a popular Obama-era directive that offered deportation protections and temporary work permits for young immigrants who lack legal status.\n\nThe announcement was welcome news to families with mixed immigration status, such as Antonio and Brenda Valle in Los Angeles. They have been married for nearly 12 years and have two sons who are U.S. citizens, but they have lived with the worry every two years that Brenda Valle\u2019s status as a DACA recipient will not be renewed.\n\n\u201cWe can start planning more long-term, for the future, instead of what we can do for the next two years,\u201d she said.\n\nFoday Turay was among those invited to the White House Tuesday for the announcement. He came to the U.S. when he was 10 years old from Sierra Leone, and is now a father to a young son and married to a third-generation U.S. citizen. Although he\u2019s enrolled in DACA and working as an assistant district attorney in Philadelphia, his status doesn\u2019t provide relief from the constant worry of deportation.\n\n\u201cMy wife is tremendously impacted by this,\u201d Turay said Tuesday before the ceremony. \u201cYou know, every day she talks to me about what\u2019s going to happen. What if I get deported? You know, how are we going to raise our son? What country are we going to raise him?\u201d\n\nRepublicans were making their own sharp contrasts with Biden\u2019s plan. In a likely preview of GOP campaign ads, Rep. Richard Hudson, chair of House Republicans\u2019 campaign arm, called the Biden policy a \u201cmass amnesty plan.\u201d Other Republicans, such as Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, anticipated that this latest directive would be struck down by the courts.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who is under consideration to be Trump\u2019s pick for vice president, forcefully advocated for legislation in 2012 that would have offered legal status to young immigrants, but on Tuesday he said \u201cthe world is different\u201d now because immigration numbers have risen.\n\nTuesday\u2019s announcement came two weeks after Biden unveiled a sweeping crackdown at the U.S.-Mexico border that effectively halted asylum claims for those arriving between officially designated ports of entry. Immigrant-rights groups have sued the Biden administration over that directive, which a senior administration official said Monday had led to fewer border encounters between ports.\n\nBiden\u2019s allies believe that the approach he is taking with his twin actions on immigration this month will resonate with voters.\n\n\u201cThe only party that is being serious about border security is the Democrats. The only party that\u2019s being thoughtful and compassionate about what to do with people who are living in the shadows are the Democrats,\u201d said Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat who helped author a bipartisan border bill earlier this year. \u201cThe Republican Party has decided to take a walk on border security.\u201d\n\nAmong advocates, Gustavo Torres, the executive director of CASA, said Biden\u2019s announcement would energize Latino communities to get out and support him.\n\n\u201cThis is what our communities have needed to rally behind President Biden for reelection,\u201d he said.\n\nBiden also announced new regulations that will allow certain DACA beneficiaries and other young immigrants to more easily qualify for long-established work visas. That would allow qualifying immigrants to have protection that is sturdier than the work permits offered by DACA, which is currently facing legal challenges and is no longer taking new applications.\n\nThe power that Biden is invoking with his Tuesday announcement for spouses is not a novel one. The policy would expand on authority used by Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama to allow \u201cparole in place\u201d for family members of military members, said Andrea Flores, a former policy adviser in the Obama and Biden administrations who is now a vice president at FWD.us, an immigration advocacy organization.\n\nThe parole-in-place process allows qualifying immigrants to get on the path to U.S. permanent residency without leaving the country, removing a common barrier for those without legal status but married to Americans. Flores called it \u201cthe biggest win for the immigrant rights movement since the announcement of DACA 12 years ago.\u201d\n\nThe same progressives who were infuriated with Biden\u2019s asylum order praised the president on Tuesday. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., who leads the Congressional Progressive Caucus, commended Biden and said the actions would help keep American families together.\n\n\u201cMany Americans would be shocked to hear that when a U.S. citizen marries an undocumented person, their spouse is not automatically eligible for citizenship,\u201d she said. \u201dImagine loving someone, marrying them, and then still continuing to fear you would be separated from them.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Christine Fernando in Racine, Wis., Valerie Gonzalez in McAllen, Texas, and Stefanie Dazio in Los Angeles contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Biden faces complex juggling act on immigration as election nears\nUS President Joe Biden has vowed not to \"play politics\" with the southern border and immigration - a potentially tall order as the US hurtles toward the November presidential election.\n\nMr Biden's comments came on what he called a \"good day\" in which he announced an executive order aimed at protecting hundreds of thousands of undocumented spouses of US citizens from deportation and allowing them to work in the US.\n\nHis actions, however, have drawn criticism from Republicans and some fellow Democrats alike, forcing the president into a complex juggling act.\n\nPolls show that a majority of voters see immigration as one of the most important problems facing the country - a fact which makes Mr Biden's stated desire to be apolitical on the issue difficult.\n\nThe new executive action announced by the administration on Tuesday has been widely praised by immigration activists and Democrats alike, many of whom have lauded it as the most significant relief programme for undocumented migrants already in the US since the Obama administration announced the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or Daca, in 2012.\n\nThe chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC), California Democrat Nanette Barrag\u00e1n, praised the move as a \u201chappy day\u201d for immigrant families, who \u201ccan go to sleep tonight knowing their loved ones will not be going anywhere\u201d.\n\nBut the latest move stands in stark contrast to his sweeping immigration order issued in early June, which allows officials to quickly remove migrants entering the US illegally without processing their asylum requests.\n\nThe executive actions - spaced out over the span of just two weeks - have highlighted the complex tightrope that Mr Biden finds himself in with regards to the issue.\n\n\u201cBiden always finds himself in a hard place,\u201d Republican strategist Doug Heye told the BBC. \u201cWhatever he does is going to get criticism. This is a perfect example.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s underperforming with Hispanic voters, so he\u2019s trying to make a move to bring in a lot of votes. But it can cost him votes as well,\u201d he added. \u201cThat is, by definition, mixed messaging.\u201d\n\nThe asylum restrictions announced on 5 June, now the focus of a lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union, were widely criticised by immigration advocates and even some of Mr Biden\u2019s Democratic allies.\n\nIn a statement, the CHC called the order \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d and symptomatic of enforcement strategies that have \u201crepeatedly proven ineffective\u201d and created \u201cchaos\u201d at the border.\n\nSpokespeople for Donald Trump, Mr Biden's Republican challenger, condemned both actions as a move towards \u201camnesty\u201d for undocumented workers.",

        "text": "Is a secret Democrat plot in motion to replace Joe Biden before 2024 election? All eyes on June 27 debate\nEarlier today, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre slammed accusations and remarks about President Joe Biden's alleged cognitive decline. Seemingly pointing out a \u201ccredibility problem\u201d with the video being shared by the right-wing critics of the Commander-in-Chief, dismissed videos of Biden appearing to freeze or in a state of confusion as \u201ccheap fakes.\u201d Each time Biden walks out in public, be it for the G7 summit or this own Hollywood-packed fundraiser, the oldest sitting president of the United States is surrounded by unwarranted chatter. FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Joe Biden reacts to questions from reporters during a meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, U.S., June 17, 2024. (REUTERS)\n\nWhile each side of the narrative pushes its own beliefs, a new report has revealed a secret Democrat plot which \u201cwill topple the aging president\" ahead of the upcoming 2024 elections. As one side of the conversation persistently voices its belief that Biden should throw in the towel and resign, a June 17 Daily Mirror report claimed that Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer have got their eyes peeled for the first presidential debate, which will pit Trump and Biden against each other on a grave platform, hosted by CNN on June 27.\n\nAs the upcoming sought-after event inches closer, it reportedly serves as Biden's last chance to quell the noise and rhetoric rising up against him and reassure voters of his credibility. This bombshell report followed videos of Biden seemingly freezing up at his Saturday Los Angeles fundraiser went viral. They supposedly picture former President Barack Obama guiding the 81-year-old sitting president off the stage. And that's just one of the several videos perturbing the masses about Biden's mental health. However, the president's team continues to flag such claims as misinformation.\n\nAlso read | Caitlin Clark vs Angel Reese 2.0: WNBA legend fumes at media's biased \u2018nasty work' in reducing entire game to foul play\n\nWhite House spokesperson Andrew Bates also denied that Biden froze during the Monday Juneteenth celebrations at the White House. Like Jean-Pierre, he too, disregarded these insinuations as \u201ccheap fake memo.\u201d\n\nAlluding to the alleged \u201cGreat Joe Biden Replacement Theory,\u201d Daily Mirror notes that the president, who's also in the running for his next term, will be \u201cswapped out as the Democratic Party's candidate ahead of the 2024 election.\u201d\n\nThe outlet also quoted polling guru Nate Silver, who wrote on social media, \u201cDropping out would be a big risk. But there's some threshold below which continuing to run is a bigger risk.\u201dHe also pointed out that Biden's average approval rating had hit a new low of 37.4% with \u201can extremely understandable concern, [as] Biden looks/acts his age and is a huge outlier to ask for the job until 86 [years old].\u201d\n\nMoreover, the recent report spotlights that Biden's critics aren't merely standing on the Republican side of the room. James Carville, the mastermind who championed Bill Clinton's presidential campaign, reportedly said earlier this month that Biden shouldn't have pitched in for the re-election.\n\nAgreeing with these concerns, former Clinton advisory and polling expert Mark Penn said, \u201cThey have deliberately thrown down the gauntlet for an early debate\u2026 and I think that's gonna be the point at which Americans judge: is he ready for another term or not.\u201d\n\nAlso read | FACT FOCUS: Biden's pause as he left a star-studded LA fundraiser becomes a target for opponents\n\nReport: How will the \u201cGreat Joe Biden Replacement Theory\u201d be implemented?\n\nWith these concerns in mind, the outlet claims to have discovered that if Biden fails to steer himself during his first standoff with Trump or if polling numbers keep turning their backs against him, some of the major players from the big pool will unite to remove the president from his re-election bid.\n\nA democratic strategist told DailyMail.com, that only Obama, Clinton, Pelosi and Schumer's united front could force Biden out. \u201cIt would have to be the four of them collectively,\u201d they said.\n\nAs possibilities of the high-risk theory loom, political columnist Joe Klein speculated in a newsletter that \u201ca vigorous young candidate \u2014 don't ask me who \u2014 could win over the country with a single convention speech' in August\u201d if Biden relinquished his post.\n\nHow would this hypothetical candidate emerge as the Democratic Party saviour? Klein surmised that they would deliver an inspirational speech similar to Obama's renowned 2004 Democratic Convention address, which would then bridge the shape between disaffected Democrats and moderate independents.\n\nHowever, it's all easier said than done. Klein conjectured that Biden could flat-out reject these ideas in motion and continue striding towards Election Day despite his own party's displeasure with him.\n\nDespite Obama's visible support for Biden this year, the report underscores some bad blood between him and the Obamas. In 2016, the former president pushed for Hillary Clinton's campaign, and subsequently, in 2020, he reportedly held back his vice president from contesting the election.\n\nAlso read | Internet fact checks Trump Jr's remarks on Trump missing from Epstein list\n\nIn late May, while Obama came out in his support at the White House state dinner, the former First Lady Michelle Obama remained absent during the meeting with the Kenyan president. According to a well-connected Democratic source, she doesn't feel strongly for the Bidens and reportedly ignored the invitation.\n\nAhead of the August Democratic National Convention in Chicago, the Party has also scheduled an online nomination with a \u201cvirtual roll call\u201d to formally choose Biden as their nominee. However, the DailyMail.com report hints that this event will deliberately take the \u201cvirtual\u201d route in case the Democratic Party opts to replace Biden. The concerned leaders would then silently punch in the replacement nominee's name in advance. However, Vice President Kamala Harris is already ruled out as a viable option, according to sources.\n\nOnce all is said and done, the Party would have to publicly address the issue. This is when Biden, Obama, Clinton, Schumer and Pelosi will reportedly come together to endorse their new pick.\n\nIf polling numbers consistently dwindle while Biden is still the Party's poster boy, drastic measures would follow. However, those alone can't confirm the Democratic victory against Trump in November. The Democratic leaders have a tough road ahead.",

        "text": "These Are the Rules of the CNN Presidential Debate\nWhen President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump meet on the debate stage on June 27, they will do so under a new set of rules designed to avoid the chaotic scenes and frequent interruptions that marked their debates during the last election.\n\nThe new rules, introduced by CNN ahead of this year\u2019s first presidential debate, include measures such as muted microphones to ensure each candidate's uninterrupted speaking time and the absence of a live audience to minimize external disruptions, a departure from the traditional framework governed by the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates.\n\nThe rule changes were proposed as a way to prevent a repeat of the first debate of the 2020 presidential cycle, during which the candidates regularly attacked each other\u2019s character. Trump repeatedly interrupted and heckled Biden, prompting Biden\u2019s memorable retort, \u201cWill you shut up, man?\u201d The moderator often failed to get the discussion back on track.\n\nBoth Biden and Trump have endorsed the new rules and committed to participate in the televised debate. Here are the biggest changes.\n\nCommercial breaks\n\nFor the first time in recent history, the debate will feature two commercial breaks during the 90-minute broadcast, a departure from past commission-hosted events which did not include corporate advertisements. (This year\u2019s debates are not being overseen by the commission.) However, campaign staff will be prohibited from interacting with their respective candidates during these intermissions, denying them the opportunity for strategic consultations or to touch up the candidates\u2019 appearance.\n\nNo opening statements\n\nUnlike previous debates, there will be no opening statements. Instead, each candidate will deliver a two-minute closing statement at the conclusion of the debate. The debate will begin with a question, with candidates each allotted two minutes to respond. This will be followed by one-minute rebuttals and responses to the rebuttals, along with additional time at the moderators' discretion. Visual cues, such as flashing red lights, will alert candidates to their remaining speaking time.\n\nMuted microphones, no notes\n\nBoth Biden and Trump will stand at identical lecterns, with their positions on stage determined by a coin toss administered by CNN. Microphones will be muted throughout the proceedings except when it is the candidate's turn to speak, a measure aimed at curtailing interruptions that have marred previous debates. CNN has said that moderators Jake Tapper and Dana Bash \u201cwill use all tools at their disposal to enforce timing and ensure a civilized discussion.\u201d\n\nEach candidate will be provided with a pen, notepad, and a bottle of water on stage; however, no props or written notes will be allowed.\n\nNo live audience\n\nIn a departure from tradition, there will be no studio audience in an attempt to minimize disruptions during the debate. Typically, audience members are instructed to remain quiet while the candidates are speaking, but that rule has not always been followed.\n\nNo White House pool reporters\n\nThe White House Correspondents\u2019 Association (WHCA) President Kelly O\u2019Donnell said in a statement on Thursday that CNN has rejected \u201crepeated requests to include the White House travel pool inside the studio\u201d for the Biden-Trump debate. The press pool includes journalists from many major news organizations that accompany the president on trips, usually having access to any public event he appears at.\n\nO\u2019Donnell said WHCA had been informed that one print reporter will be allowed in the studio during a commercial break \u201cto briefly observe the setting,\u201d but insisted that was \u201cnot sufficient\u201d and \u201cdiminishes a core principle of presidential coverage.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe pool is there for the \u2018what ifs?\u2019 in a world where the unexpected does happen,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said.\u201cA pool reporter is present to provide context and insight by direct observation and not through the lens of the television production. A pool reporter is an independent observer whose duties are separate from the production of the debate as a news event.\u201d\n\nCNN responded to the WHCA\u2019s concerns in a statement, saying that while it respects the role of the association, the debate \u201cis being held without an audience in a CNN studio and is closed to press.\u201d",

        "text": "US elections 2024: Who will be Donald Trump\u2019s vice president?\nSeveral names are on Trump\u2019s shortlist, with the ex-president set to unveil his pick before or at July\u2019s Republican convention.\n\nSo far, the 2024 United States presidential race has been short on surprises.\n\nAs the incumbent, President Joe Biden was a shoo-in for the Democratic nomination once he announced he would seek re-election alongside Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nAnd among Republicans, former President Donald Trump has long been the frontrunner \u2014 and he rapidly and resoundingly trounced his challengers in the party primaries.\n\nOne question that has lingered, though, is who will be Trump\u2019s pick for vice president.\n\nWhile the vice presidency holds limited power in US politics, past elections have shown that the choice can be a boost \u2014 or a liability \u2014 to presidential campaigns.\n\nThis year\u2019s Republican vice-presidential pick could be especially important, given the race between Trump and Biden is expected to be tight. Trump is expected to reveal his choice in the coming weeks, well ahead of the November 5 election.\n\nHere, Al Jazeera looks at Trump\u2019s possible running mates, their views and what they could bring to the 2024 Republican ticket.\n\nElise Stefanik, US congresswoman\n\nWhen she was first elected to the House of Representatives in 2014, Stefanik was the youngest woman in history to join the chamber. She was 30 years old at the time.\n\nShe has since become a rising star in the Republican Party, representing New York\u2019s 21st District.\n\nStefanik currently serves as the House Republican Conference Chair, the number-three leadership role for Republicans in the House. She is also one of Trump\u2019s staunchest supporters in Congress.\n\nStefanik, who has backed Trump\u2019s false claims that the 2020 election was stolen through widespread voter fraud, was among the 147 Republican lawmakers who voted against certifying Biden\u2019s election victory.\n\nShe gained national attention earlier this year when she used a congressional hearing to hammer US university presidents over pro-Palestine protests on their campuses, accusing the administrators of allowing anti-Semitism to go unchecked.\n\nBut critics have noted that Stefanik herself has come under fire for discriminatory messaging. In 2021, for instance, her campaign released advertisements warning that immigration would \u201coverthrow our current electorate and create a permanent liberal majority\u201d.\n\nThat messaging, critics say, mirrored the so-called \u201cgreat replacement theory\u201d, a white supremacist conspiracy theory that falsely asserts that white people are being replaced as a result of a plot to increase non-white immigration. The theory was invoked in an attack on a Pittsburgh synagogue in 2018, one of the deadliest instances of anti-Jewish violence in recent US history.\n\nIn recent weeks, Stefanik has visited Israel to show support as the country wages a deadly war in the Gaza Strip. She has also slammed Trump\u2019s conviction on felony charges in New York, saying the verdict was the result of a \u201crigged\u201d justice system.\n\nTim Scott, US senator\n\nThe only Black Republican in the US Senate, the South Carolina politician entered the presidential race in May last year \u2014 but dropped out before the primaries even began, throwing his weight behind Trump.\n\nThe former president praised Scott as \u201ca great politician\u201d after receiving his endorsement.\n\nSince then, Scott has been a prominent backer of Trump, defending the ex-president in scores of major US television news interviews and joining him on the campaign trail.\n\nEarlier this month, US media outlets reported that Scott was launching an outreach effort worth more than $14m to get Black voters to support Republicans in key battleground states in November.\n\n\u201cThe Republican Party, we offer you freedom. They [Democrats] offer you oppression,\u201d he said in a recent social media video about what the GOP can offer communities of colour. \u201cWe offer mo\u2019 money; they offer no money.\u201d\n\nOn policy, Scott \u2014 who regularly invokes his Christian faith \u2014 has voiced support for law enforcement, pledged to protect religious liberty against what he said was an \u201cassault\u201d by the far left, and promised to reform the education system.\n\nJD Vance, US senator\n\nVance jumped into US politics in 2022 after the success of his book, Hillbilly Elegy, which detailed his upbringing in the country\u2019s Rust Belt.\n\nA venture capitalist, Vance graduated from Yale Law School and served in the US military during the Iraq War before being elected to represent the state of Ohio in the Senate.\n\nHe has made a name for himself thanks to his fierce criticism of the Biden administration, particularly over issues like the economy and immigration.\n\nHis embrace of so-called \u201cculture war\u201d issues has also made him a conservative darling, particularly among Trump\u2019s Make America Great Again (MAGA) base. He regularly denounces diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes that aim to address systemic racism and other forms of discrimination.\n\nVance has used his family history and early life to try to paint himself as a defender of white, working-class Americans.\n\nTom Cotton, US senator\n\nCotton \u2014 a US senator from the state of Arkansas \u2014 is outspoken on a range of domestic issues, but much of his focus has been on foreign policy.\n\nHe is a vocal defender of Israel and recently joined a group of US lawmakers who introduced legislation to sanction the International Criminal Court if it pursues arrest warrants for Israeli leaders accused of committing war crimes in Gaza.\n\nFaced with concerns that Trump could curtail assistance to Ukraine if elected, Cotton defended the former president, saying he \u201csupports Ukraine\u2019s strength and survival\u201d as it fends of a full-scale Russian invasion.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think President Trump wants to prejudge what the situation will be come January, nor do I, in part because we have no idea how much worse Joe Biden can screw things up. We have to judge the circumstances as they exist, next year when [Trump] returns to office,\u201d Cotton said on FOX News.\n\nWhile Trump has been sceptical of continued US aid for Kyiv \u2014 highlighting divisions within the Republican Party itself \u2014 Cotton recently voted in favour of a massive bill that included $61bn for Ukraine.\n\nCotton is also a hawk on China and has led efforts in Congress to \u201cdecouple\u201d the US and Chinese economies. Among his signature causes is an effort to sever the social media platform TikTok from its developer, the Chinese firm ByteDance, over national security concerns.\n\nThe Arkansas Republican drew criticism earlier this year when he pressed TikTok\u2019s CEO Shou Chew on whether he had ties to the Chinese Communist Party during a congressional hearing.\n\nIn an exchange that went viral on social media, Cotton asked: \u201cHave you ever been a member of the Chinese Community Party?\u201d Chew replied, \u201cSenator, I\u2019m Singaporean. No.\u201d\n\nDoug Burgum, governor of North Dakota\n\nA former software executive and multimillionaire, Burgum ended his long-shot bid for the Republican presidential nomination in December and endorsed Trump about a month later.\n\nHe had struggled to generate early momentum for his campaign, particularly in the lead-up to the Republican presidential debates last year.\n\nHis campaign initially stayed afloat by offering gift cards in exchange for campaign donations. That setup allowed him to meet the minimum number of donors to qualify for the party\u2019s first two debates.\n\nTrump praised Burgum\u2019s business prowess after receiving his endorsement, telling a North Dakota radio station: \u201cI\u2019ve always had a lot of respect for Doug.\u201d\n\nAs North Dakota\u2019s governor, Burgum signed into law a near-total abortion ban, as well as legislation making it a crime to provide gender-affirming healthcare to most minors.\n\nBurgum and other Republican legislators travelled to New York City last month to show support for Trump during his criminal hush-money trial. Echoing the ex-president himself, Burgum denounced the case as \u201celection interference\u201d.\n\nMarco Rubio, US senator\n\nThe Florida Republican is one of the most experienced politicians on Trump\u2019s shortlist for vice president \u2014 though the ex-president has a history of sparring with him.\n\nThe son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio has represented Florida in the US Senate since 2011.\n\nHe sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, facing Trump in the race. They frequently traded personal jabs during the primaries.\n\nRubio, for instance, called Trump a \u201ccon artist\u201d and said he had turned the 2016 race into \u201cone of the most vulgar spectacles in American political history\u201d. Trump described Rubio as a \u201cchoker\u201d and a \u201clightweight\u201d. He also dismissively nicknamed the Florida senator \u201cLittle Marco\u201d.\n\nBut Rubio has since embraced and defended the former president, calling Trump\u2019s recent conviction in the New York hush-money case an \u201cugly, ugly blemish\u201d on the US\u2019s reputation.\n\nThe Florida senator has said he wants to \u201csecure\u201d the US-Mexico border and has backed a 15-week ban on abortion in the state. On foreign policy, Rubio comes from the hawkish wing of the Republican Party and has promoted hardline policies against Cuba, Iran and China.\n\nChoosing Rubio as his vice president would present a minor complication for the Trump campaign: The 12th Amendment of the US Constitution states that presidential and vice-presidential nominees cannot be from the same home state.\n\nTrump and Rubio are both Florida residents. But if Rubio is Trump\u2019s pick, he could change his official residency before the election.",

        "text": "Biden\u2019s new immigration plan: How will it work?\nJoe Biden\u2019s latest plan, announced ahead of the 2024 election, gives some undocumented migrants a pathway to United States citizenship.\n\nUnited States President Joe Biden has announced an initiative that can offer citizenship to roughly half a million undocumented immigrants married to US citizens in a move ahead of the November presidential election.\n\n\u201cThe Statue of Liberty is not some relic of American history. It still stands for who we are,\u201d Biden said at the White House on Tuesday, as he articulated his Democratic Party\u2019s line on immigration \u2013 a hot-button issue in the country.\n\n\u201cBut I also refuse to believe that for us to continue to be an America that embraces immigration, we have to give up securing our border. They\u2019re false choices,\u201d he said defending the curbs on asylum-seeking at the US-Mexico border announced on June 4.\n\nThe move will also pave the way for the children of these immigrants to attain US citizenship. A White House statement said the move will \u201censure that US citizens with non-citizen spouses and children can keep their families together\u201d.\n\nHere\u2019s more about the new programme announced months ahead of the presidential elections:\n\nWhat is Biden\u2019s new immigration plan?\n\nUnder the sweeping new immigration plan, undocumented spouses of US citizens who have been living in the US can request lawful permanent residence while staying in the country.\n\nHowever, the requests will not all be approved and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will consider these requests on a case-by-case basis.\n\nTo be eligible, the spouses have to be married and living in the US for at least 10 years as of June 17, 2024, and \u201cnot pose a threat to public safety or national security\u201d, according to a DHS fact sheet.\n\nThe processing of permanent residence applications can take months to years. Those granted permanent residency, called getting a \u201cgreen card\u201d in the US, can apply for US citizenship.\n\nBefore this plan was introduced, spouses living in the US without documents would have to travel to their home country and apply for citizenship at a consulate \u2013 a process that could take anywhere from three to 10 years.\n\n\u201cThey [undocumented spouses of US citizens] have to leave their families in America with no assurance that they will be allowed back in the United States. So they stay in America, but in the shadows, living in constant fear of deportation without the ability to legally work,\u201d said Biden in a White House speech, explaining why the old system needed a fix.\n\n\n\nWho will Biden\u2019s immigration plan benefit?\n\nThe DHS fact sheet says that around 500,000 non-citizen spouses of US citizens are eligible for the programme.\n\nAdditionally, around 50,000 children of these spouses are also eligible for this process.\n\nWhat are Biden\u2019s other recent immigration measures?\n\nOn Tuesday, Biden announced a separate policy that will help Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients, also called \u201cDreamers\u201d.\n\nThe DACA programme was introduced in 2012 by the administration of former President Barack Obama, when Biden served as vice president, as temporary deportation relief for children who came to the US as undocumented immigrants with their parents.\n\nUnder Biden\u2019s recent programme, companies who employ DACA recipients can apply for a work visa for them, which can pave the way for permanent residency.\n\nTuesday\u2019s sweeping measures come two weeks after Biden imposed restrictions on the right to seek asylum at the US-Mexico border, which saw a surge in unauthorised crossings last year. Critics slammed Biden\u2019s asylum restrictions, saying they mirrored the policies of former president Donald Trump, who has pushed for hardline approaches to immigration. Immigrant rights groups have sued Biden over the June 4 border asylum restrictions.\n\n\n\nHow have Republicans reacted to Biden\u2019s immigration programme?\n\nDonald Trump, Biden\u2019s challenger: \u201cBiden only cares about one thing \u2013 power \u2013 and that\u2019s why he is giving mass amnesty and citizenship to hundreds of thousands of illegals who he knows will ultimately vote for him and the Open Border Democrat Party.\u201d\n\n\u201cBiden only cares about one thing \u2013 power \u2013 and that\u2019s why he is giving mass amnesty and citizenship to hundreds of thousands of illegals who he knows will ultimately vote for him and the Open Border Democrat Party.\u201d Mike Johnson, House speaker: Biden is \u201ctrying to play both sides and is granting amnesty to hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens,\u201d Johnson said in an X post. \u201cThis is proof-positive of the Democrats\u2019 plan to turn illegal aliens into voters\u201d.\n\nRick Scott, US senator from Florida: \u201cWhile families struggle to pay the bills, Biden is sending our deficit through the roof to pay for free housing & food for illegal immigrants,\u201d Scott posted on X.\n\nHow important is immigration to the 2024 elections?",

        "text": "What is the controversy around EVMs in the US?\nElon Musk on June 15 called for the elimination of electronic voting machines (EVMs) in a post on X. He made this remark while commenting on a post by US presidential hopeful Robert Franklin Kennedy Jr about alleged irregularities in Puerto Rico\u2019s primary elections that could be attributed to EVMs.\n\nThis comment kicked up a storm in India, with former Minister of State Rajeev Chandrasekhar stepping in to defend the use of EVMs in India, and opposition leaders Rahul Gandhi of the Congress and the Samajwadi Party\u2019s Akhilesh Yadav decrying its use.\n\nHowever, the issue of EVM manipulation will become increasingly relevant as the US gears up to elect its 47th President on November 5, 2024.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is the system of voting followed in the US? Why is there widespread distrust over the use of EVMs in the country? We explain.\n\nVoting in America over the years\n\nUntil 2000, the US followed a paper ballot system using antiquated punch-card voting machines. The controversial showdown during the presidential elections that year between former Vice-President and Democrat Al Gore and the Republican George W Bush did more than just propel the latter to power \u2013 it highlighted the need to overhaul the faulty ballot design. Voters were required to mark their votes by punching on \u2018chads\u2019 or paper chits attached to the ballots. These chads, however, were not always completely punched out due to technical issues, making the counting a hassle for poll workers.\n\nUS Presidential elections 2024 | What are Iowa caucuses and why are they significant?\n\nThis led to the implementation of the Help America Vote Act or the HAVA (2002). Among its many sweeping changes, the HAVA mandated a major upgrade of voting equipment resulting in the eventual shift to EVMs \u2014 different types of electronic ballot marking machines were introduced, including the Direct Recording Electronic voting machines or DREs, which became the go-to EVM for voting.\n\nAnother key change was the introduction of the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines to \u201cprovide a set of specifications and requirements against which voting systems can be tested to determine if they provide all the basic functionality, accessibility, and security capabilities required of voting systems.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith these changes in place, the stage was set for a complete transition to a paperless balloting process. However, this did not happen. In the 2022 midterm elections, nearly 70% of all registered voters relied on hand-marked paper ballots and 23% used ballot marking devices, according to a report by Reuters. Only 7% of all registered voters would rely on DREs with no paper record, a figure that has steadily declined over the years, the report added.\n\nWhile the mistrust around the use of DREs continued to grow gradually post-2007, things came to a head with the allegations of Russian interference and the involvement of analytics firm, Cambridge Analytica in the 2016 Presidential election. These issues concerned the voter registration systems and had less to do with the DREs themselves. However, there was an increasing consensus to back up election results in fear of a potential hack on the systems themselves.\n\nThe contention around DREs\n\nDREs have had a contested history in the US. The first documented use of a DRE dates back to 1975 in Streamwood and Woodstock, Illinois where Video Voter, a patented DRE machine, was first used. However, the presence of DREs in elections would not become mainstream until the HAVA was passed in 2002. In the following decade, a third of all votes would be on DREs.\n\nThe mechanism of the DRE has evolved over the decades, from rudimentary electrical versions of the mechanical lever machines used in the 1970s to today\u2019s portable computers with touchscreens or push buttons which can display ballot choices and record votes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe transition to DREs was criticised by many, with Congress releasing a document with FAQs in 2007 that flagged the reliance on a computer to cast, record and store votes in a single machine as a weakness that hackers could exploit. \u201cBecause the machines rely on complicated software, it is at least theoretically possible that someone could insert hidden computer code that would add, subtract, or change votes,\u201d the report said.\n\nToday a solution exists in the form of a paper record called Voter-Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) used with a DRE to audit the votes cast. A paper trail serves as a form of insurance against any attempts at hacking the machine. A report coauthored by the NGO Verified Voting estimates that only three states will use paperless equipment in the upcoming 2024 Presidential elections.\n\nExpress View on the US presidential race | Change and continuity\n\nThe way forward\n\nA Wharton report titled \u2018The Business of Voting\u2019 published in 2017 was the first of its kind investigating the conditions around the American voting process and flagged the lack of transparency in the EVM market in the country. About 90% of all voting machines in the US are made by three companies, including Dominion Voting, which manufactured the machines for the Puerto Rico elections. However, there is negligible data available in the public domain about the size of the market, or its actual state of finances. This situation has raised concerns about the extent of private influence on the larger electoral process.\n\nThe issue of ageing EVMs has also been flagged repeatedly by multiple experts, but the actual timeline of their replacement varies across states. This has resulted in many counties using voting machines long past their average shelf life of 10 years.\n\nWith the rising wave of mistrust and clamour by conservatives, most notably former President Donald Trump to return to a completely paper-based ballot, the federal government in 2017 took the step to add the nation\u2019s voting systems to its list of critical infrastructure, which also includes defence industry, transportation, healthcare and emergency services. Post-2016, Congress has reportedly invested $995 million to boost the election administration and security infrastructure for states, with most of the allocation coming in the run-up to the 2020 election.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday there is increasing favour for EVMs powered by open-source software (OSS), which allows anyone to read, modify and flag errors in code and theoretically ensures better accuracy. While the debate on publicising the source code of voting machines continues, a few states are experimenting with their use.",

        "text": "U.S. President Biden offers massive immigration relief to non-citizens ahead of election\nPresident Joe Biden on Tuesday unveiled a massive immigration relief policy to non-citizens offering a path to citizenship to non-citizen spouses and children of American nationals, a move that will protect approximately half a million spouses of US citizens, several thousands of whom are Indian-Americans.\n\n\u201cThis action will protect approximately half a million spouses of US citizens, and approximately 50,000 non-citizen children under the age of 21 whose parents are married to a US citizen,\u201d the White House said.\n\nBiden, who is seeking re-election in the November 5 presidential election, has directed the Department of Homeland Security to take action to ensure that US citizens with non-citizen spouses and children can keep their families together.\n\nAlso read: Bipartisan National Security Agreement provides 100K work authorisation to spouses and children of H-1B visa holders\n\nThis new process will help certain non-citizen spouses and children apply for lawful permanent residence - status that they are already eligible for - without leaving the country, the White House said.\n\nThese actions will promote family unity and strengthen our economy, providing a significant benefit to the country and helping US citizens and their noncitizen family members stay together, it added.\n\nThe action is aimed at appealing to key Latino constituencies in battleground states, including Arizona, Nevada and Georgia, that will be crucial for Biden\u2019s chances to claim a second term, CNN reported.\n\nThe move is an olive branch to immigration advocates and progressives, many of whom have sharply criticised Biden for previous restrictive actions, including taking steps this month to limit asylum processing at the US southern border, it said.\n\nBiden has also directed to allow individuals including DACA recipients and other Dreamers, who have earned a degree at an accredited US institution of higher education in the United States, and who have received an offer of employment from a US employer in a field related to their degree, to more quickly receive work visas.\n\n\u201cRecognising that it is in our national interest to ensure that individuals who are educated in the US are able to use their skills and education to benefit our country, the Administration is taking action to facilitate the employment visa process for those who have graduated from college and have a high-skilled job offer, including DACA recipients and other Dreamers,\u201d the White House said.\n\n\u201cDreamer\u201d originally referred to the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act, a piece of legislation that would have given immigrant youth legal status and a path to US citizenship.\n\nAccording to the White House, to be eligible, non-citizens must - as of June 17, 2024 - have resided in the United States for 10 or more years and be legally married to a US citizen, while satisfying all applicable legal requirements. On average, those who are eligible for this process have resided in the US for 23 years.\n\nThose who are approved after DHS\u2019s case-by-case assessment of their application will be afforded a three-year period to apply for permanent residency. They will be allowed to remain with their families in the US and be eligible for work authorisation for up to three years. This will apply to all married couples who are eligible.\n\nAlso read: Nearly 66K Indians took oath of American citizenship in 2022: CRS report\n\nAccording to the White House, this programme will protect approximately half a million spouses of US citizens, and approximately 50,000 non-citizen children under the age of 21 whose parents are married to a US citizen.\n\nMore than 1.1 million undocumented spouses married to a US citizen, thousands of whom are Indian-Americans, have lived in the US on average 16 years, and many have been married to their US citizen spouses for at least a decade. The announcement is expected to impact approximately 500,000 undocumented spouses of US citizens and 50,000 undocumented children of US citizens nationwide.\n\nOpposing the move, the rival Trump campaign said that Biden\u2019s mass amnesty plan will undoubtedly lead to a greater surge in migrant crime, cost taxpayers millions of dollars they cannot afford, overwhelm public services, and steal Social Security and Medicare benefits from American seniors to fund benefits for illegals \u2014 draining the programs Americans paid into their entire working lives.\n\n\u201cBiden has created another invitation for illegal immigration through his mass amnesty order,\u201d said Trump campaign National Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.\n\nUS Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, applauded Biden\u2019s announcement to offer relief to hundreds of thousands of immigrants, including DACA holders and undocumented spouses and children of US citizens.\n\n\u201cAllowing those who have lived here at least ten years a chance to continue living here without fear of deportation is fair and long overdue. The Republican Party and its chosen leader see immigration in terms of fear and hate and \u2018poisoning the blood\u2019 of America. President Biden understands that, as challenging as it may be, immigration is at the heart of who we are as Americans. I commend President Biden for today\u2019s announcement. It\u2019s the right thing,\u201d said Durbin.",

        "text": "Biden immigration program offers legal status to 500,000 spouses of U.S. citizens. Here's how it works.\nWho would be eligible for citizenship in Biden's new immigration policy?\n\nPresident Biden on Tuesday announced a large-scale immigration program that will offer legal status and a streamlined path to U.S. residency and citizenship to roughly half a million unauthorized immigrants married to American citizens.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security policy will allow these immigrants to apply for work permits and deportation protections if they have lived in the U.S. for at least 10 years and meet other requirements, senior administration officials said previewing the announcement.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, however, Mr. Biden's move will unlock a path to permanent residency \u2014 colloquially known as a green card \u2014 and ultimately U.S. citizenship for many of the program's beneficiaries.\n\n\"For those wives or husbands and their children who have lived in America for a decade or more, but are undocumented, this action will allow them to file paperwork for legal status in the United States, allowing them to work while they remain with their families in the United States,\" Mr. Biden said.\n\nThe policy, if upheld in court, would be the largest government program for undocumented immigrants since the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals initiative, which currently shields 528,000 so-called \"Dreamers\" who were brought to the U.S. as children from deportation.\n\nMr. Biden announced the measure at a White House event on Tuesday marking the 12th anniversary of DACA, alongside another move to make it easier for employers to sponsor \"Dreamers\" and other undocumented immigrants for work visas.\n\nIt's the second time in one month that Mr. Biden has taken a sweeping \u2014 and legally risky \u2014 executive action on immigration. Earlier in June, he invoked a presidential power used frequently by former President Donald Trump to disqualify most migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border from asylum.\n\nHow Biden's immigration plan would work\n\nPresident Biden speaks in the East Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, June 18, 2024. Ting Shen/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nThe Biden administration program for undocumented immigrants married to U.S. citizens will provide two key immigration benefits.\n\nIt will allow eligible applicants to work and live in the U.S. legally on a temporary basis under the immigration parole authority. The policy, known as \"Parole in Place,\" will also help these immigrants clear roadblocks in U.S. law that prevent them from getting permanent legal status without having to leave the country.\n\nAn immigrant who marries a U.S. citizen is generally eligible for a green card. But current federal law requires immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally to leave the country and re-enter legally to be eligible for a green card. Leaving the U.S. after living illegally in the country for certain periods of time can trigger a 10-year ban, leading many mixed-status families to not pursue this process.\n\nThe Biden administration's policy would allow eligible immigrants to obtain a green card without having to leave the U.S. After 3 to 5 years of living in the U.S. as a green card holder, immigrants can apply for American citizenship.\n\nAdministration officials estimate that roughly 500,000 unauthorized immigrants with U.S. citizen spouses will qualify for the program. Applicants must have been legally married to their American citizen spouse by June 17. Those who are deemed to pose a threat to national security or public safety will not qualify.\n\nThe policy is also expected to benefit an estimated 50,000 immigrant children with a parent who is married to a U.S. citizen, officials said. Undocumented stepchildren of U.S. citizens \u2014 who must also leave the country to obtain green cards \u2014 will be eligible to apply for the parole process if they are under the age of 21.\n\nA senior administration official said the government is planning to open the Parole in Place program to applications \"by the end of summer.\" The policy will almost certainly generate legal challenges, possibly from Republican-led states, which have sued the Biden administration over its immigration policies several times.\n\nFor over a decade, the U.S. government has overseen a more limited Parole in Place policy for unauthorized immigrants who are the immediate relatives of U.S. service members or veterans. In 2020, Congress affirmed that policy.\n\nThe State Department is also announcing on Tuesday a streamlined process for DACA recipients and other undocumented immigrants who have graduated from U.S. colleges to more easily obtain employment-based visas, such as H-1B visas for high-skilled workers.",

Be Part of the Movement.\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nIf elected he will not serve, of course, but Cooper seems more vested in being part of the discussion as the election season intensifies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same joke over and over. It was funny when I started doing it, now I\u2019m really tired of it,\u201d the Arizona resident tells Billboard from his current tour in Europe. \u201cI just can\u2019t\u2019 believe these two (candidates) are the best we can do. Y\u2019know what they really are? These two are the best that money can buy. What they should do is just pick up a phone book and put a finger on somebody; whoever it is, if it\u2019s a guy who owns a gas station in Iowa, he should be president\u2026 It seems like anybody out there can be better than these two guys.\u201d\n\nCooper adds that touring overseas has also given him additional perspective about the situation. \u201cEveryone here\u2019s terrified with what\u2019s happening with our presidential race,\u201d the artist says. \u201cEverybody that I talk to in Europe goes, \u2018Really? Is that the best you can do is these two guys?\u2019 and I go, \u2018I have no idea.'\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s been adding to the political commentary, too, by keeping the straitjacket that he wears during \u201cBallad of Dwight Fry\u201d on when he mounts the tall, bunting-adorned podium to deliver \u201cElected.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the funniest bit of it. Here\u2019s this maniac in a straitjacket going, \u2018You could do better! I\u2019m your man!\u2019 Alice in the straitjacket makes the point, y\u2019know? \u2018Let insanity reign!'\u201d\n\nElectoral satire aside, Cooper\u2019s own campaign trail will be a busy one for the rest of the year. He and his band are in Europe through mid-July, returning to North America starting July 30 in Niagara Falls, Canada, and including another run of the Freaks On Parade Tour with Rob Zombie, Ministry and Filter during the late summer. Another European run, meanwhile, takes place in October.\n\nCooper has also finished work on \u201ca surprise album\u201d to follow last year\u2019s Road. He isn\u2019t offering any details, including a title or release date, other than \u201cit turned out to be very unique.\u201d He\u2019s also enjoying new life on syndicated radio with Alice\u2019s Attic, the successor to Nights With Alice Cooper. He\u2019s expanded his presentation with the five-hour program, introducing a variety of characters and more aural theatricality.\n\n\u201cI actually am having more fun with it now, because I can go to different places with it,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cIt\u2019s basically the same kind of show except now I put it into a form where I can have characters, \u2019cause once you\u2019re in Alice\u2019s Attic there\u2019s broken dolls, a butler, Madeline the Mannequin \u2014 things you would normally find in an attic are now characters in the show. I\u2019ve gotten to make it a little creepier, a little funnier.\u201d",

        "text": "What The Housing Market Could Look Like If Donald Trump Wins The 2024 Presidential Election\nWhat The Housing Market Could Look Like If Donald Trump Wins The 2024 Presidential Election\n\nAccording to experts and recent data, Donald Trump\u2019s potential reelection could reshape the U.S. housing market amid soaring mortgage rates and escalating home prices.\n\nThe current state of the housing market, characterized by two-decade high borrowing costs and record home prices, is straining affordability for many Americans. With the presidential election approaching, industry specialists are examining how Trump\u2019s policies \u2014 ranging from deregulation to tax and trade measures \u2014 might influence market dynamics, potentially easing some pressures but also introducing new risks.\n\n\n\nAccording to a survey issued Monday by National Mortgage News, while many mortgage professionals lean Republican, the consensus suggests that the next presidential term, regardless of the winner, may not alter the course for lenders and mortgage origination activities.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\n\u200b\u200b Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" This high-yield real estate fund, offering an 8% yield , makes earning passive income easier than ever.\n\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\n\n\n\"We\u2019re not assuming the election changes anything significantly for the mortgage industry,\" Keefe, Bruyette and Woods managing director Bose George said to National Mortgage News.\n\n\n\nHis sentiment reflects a broader skepticism about the presidential influence over key economic levers, notably interest rates, which are controlled by the Federal Reserve rather than any direct political interventions.\n\n\n\nHowever, the Wall Street Journal reported in April that members of the Trump campaign were developing a plan that would see the Fed restructured under Trump (should he win in November), and he would be given authority over interest rate decisions.\n\n\n\nSuch a change would be significant for the former president, who, during his last presidency, attempted to influence the Fed on rate decisions.\n\nTrending: The average American couple has saved this much money for retirement \u2014 How do you compare?\n\n\n\nOutside of interest rates, nuances in policy under Trump\u2019s potential leadership could foster an environment of lesser regulatory burdens, according to the survey. During his previous term, Trump\u2019s administration was known for rolling back regulations, which some argue could again lead to more business-friendly conditions but also raise concerns about the risks of under-regulated financial activities.\n\n\n\nCritics point to the potential for relaxed lending standards that could increase market volatility.\n\n\n\nRegarding housing agency leadership, Trump\u2019s appointments could signal a shift toward less aggressive regulatory oversight. Observers like Bill Killmer, the Mortgage Bankers Association's (MBA) senior vice president for legislative and political affairs, suggest a Trump administration would likely emulate the less interventionist stances of previous Republican appointees, focusing strictly on statutory mandates without extending into the \"gray areas\" often explored by Democratic appointees.\n\n\n\nThe Department of Justice's ongoing probe into Realtor commissions, which was rekindled during Trump's last year in office, is also seen as likely to wane under a Republican administration.\n\n\n\nA change in that arena could affect the landscape of real estate transactions and potentially ease some of the pressures on Realtor commissions.\n\n\n\n\"If you saw a change of administration, going back into a Republican regime, I do think that you would see a less active DOJ in this space,\" KBW's George said in the report. \"So that might change how they move things going forward.\"\n\n\n\nFurther, the government\u2019s control over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could shift under a second Trump administration. Trump had previously advocated for ending their government conservatorship, signaling potential renewed efforts in that direction.\n\n\n\nHowever, experts, including Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) former director Mark Calabria, warn that achieving full privatization would be a complex and lengthy process.\n\n\n\nLastly, tax policy. According to the survey, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, signed by Trump in 2017, expires in 2025. While President Biden is prepared to let the cuts expire, Trump advocates extending them, arguing that their lapse could damage the economy.\n\n\n\nKillmer pointed to a need for legislative action to maintain incentives encouraging real estate investment, regardless of the election outcome. Extending the cuts, however, would increase the federal deficit by $4.6 trillion, the survey said, citing data from the Congressional Budget Office.\n\n\n\nStory Continues",

        "text": "Employers taking \u2018wait and see\u2019 approach before US presidential election\nThe United States presidential election takes place in a little over 4 months\u2019 time on 5 November. Voters will decide between incumbent President Joe Biden and his Democratic Party, and former Republican President Donald Trump with the winner inaugurated on January 20, 2025. The polls suggest it is a tight race which means there is uncertainty over the country\u2019s legislative programme. Legislation, which is currently making progress may, or may not, become law by 5 November and, even if it does become law, a Tump administration could reverse it very quickly.\n\n\n\nThat uncertainty is a problem if you are a business with a presence in the US trying to plan ahead. For example:\n\n\n\nThe FTC\u2019s non-compete rule on course to become law on 4 September unless one of the many legal challenges to it proves successful. The rule operates to ban most post-employment non-compete agreements between employers and their workers. It\u2019s a very big deal for employers concerned about how to protect the business if the rule passes.\n\n\n\nThere is also Biden\u2019s plan to extend mandatory overtime pay to an estimated 4 million salaried workers. That would require employers to pay overtime premiums to workers who earn a salary of less than $1,128 per week, or about $58,600 per year, when they work more than 40 hours in a week.\n\n\n\nThere is also the expansion of what constitutes protected employee concerted activity under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act. This is where two or more employees act together to improve the terms and conditions of their employment. Over the past decade, the parameters of protected concerted activity have expanded and contracted, based on the objectives of the NLRB under different political administrations making compliance challenging and means employers need to be cautious when taking disciplinary action against employees who have complained about their wages, hours, or working conditions.\n\n\n\nSo let\u2019s get a view on how the current uncertainty is affecting employers. Scott LeBlanc is an employment lawyer in the US at law firm Husch Blackwell in Wisconsin and earlier he joined me by video-link phone to discuss it. First the election in November:\n\n\n\nScott Le Blanc: \u201cRight, so obviously we have the presidential elections and with that comes the congressional elections coming up at the beginning of November and so anytime we are only a couple months away from an election, an election that, particularly this year, but you know, anytime that we have a large federal election, if there's a change in power there's going to be a lot of changes with respect to laws in many different areas, labour and employment included. So we've got a couple of different things that are going on right now that our clients are wrestling with and they're asking us, what do we do in the meantime between now and the election and a lot of times our answer is it's really wait and see.\u201d\n\n\n\nJoe Glavina: \u201cOne of the areas of uncertainty, Scott, is around the expansion of what constitutes Protected Concerted Activity under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act. Can you tell me about that and the role of the NLRB?\u201d\n\n\n\nScott Le Blanc: \u201cSo, the National Labor Relations Board, of all of the federal agencies that we have, and we talked a little bit about the Federal Trade Commission which is the agency that covers the non-compete rule, the Department of Labor which is the agency that enforces the salary basis rule. The National Labour Relations Board, which is concerned with, essentially, union organising activity in the United States is the one federal agency in the labor and employment space that is probably the most affected whenever there's a change in power in the White House. When there is a Republican administration in the White House we tend to have a very hands-off National Labour Relations Board and when there is a Democratic administration in the White House we tend to have a National Labor Relations Board that does everything in their power to try and encourage employees to exercise their rights to unionise and to give unions a leg up in negotiations. So we had four years of a National Labor Relations Board under President Trump from 2016 to 2020. That was followed up by President Biden coming in with a lot of organised labor support and his national Labor Relations Board has been very activist as far as going after employers for things like independent contractor misclassification, electronic monitoring of communications, cracking down on things like non-disclosure agreements. You mentioned Protected Concerted Activity, and this was a theme that first came up in the Obama-Biden administration from 2008 to 2016, which is essentially this concept of non-union employees having certain rights under the National Labor Relations Act to get together and to discuss terms and conditions of their employment and that's called Protected Concerted Activity. So these are the union rules that apply even to non-unionised workplaces and that that is difficult for clients because usually our clients that have unionised workforces understand the scheme and how to work with unions but non-union employers generally tend to think that they don't have any obligations with respect to union rights and so this is something that often is sort of off their radar. So the Obama-Biden administration kicked off this real push toward protecting concerted activity and back then it was really focused on social media policies. The idea that social media is a water cooler for employees to be able to get together and discuss terms and conditions of their employment and gripes that they might have about unfair conditions in the workplace and that's come back under the Biden administration with, I think, even more aggression from an enforcement standpoint at the National Labor Relations Board than we saw under President Obama. We had a recent case that involved an employee at Home Depot who was disciplined for writing Black Lives Matter on their on their work gear and that was determined by the National Labor Relations Board to be protected concerted activity because they interpreted that as a statement of looking for mutual aid and protection in the workplace, not necessarily just a political statement. So they've looked for these opportunities to advance this idea of protected concerted activity. I think, ultimately, the goal is they want employees to feel empowered and, ultimately, that's going to lead to more employees getting together, realising that they have the ability to collectively bargain and form a union. So that's the ultimate goal here and they're trying to open the doors for that type of activity as much as possible in these non-union workplaces.\u201d\n\n\n\nJoe Glavina: \u201cSo given the uncertainty around this which you\u2019ve talked about, what is the problem facing employers?\u201d\n\n\n\nScott Le Blanc: \u201dWhere this tends to trip up employers is in things like employee handbook policies that speak to things like you can't make statements on behalf of the company, non-disparagement language in employee handbooks, codes of conduct that talk about things like maintaining proper decorum in the workplace. That's the kind of language, this sort of civility language in the workplace, that the National Labor Relations Board is getting really touchy about which they think has the chilling effect on protected concerted activity. Certainly if you're in the middle of an NLRB audit, or an issue that you're dealing directly with the NLRB, where they've highlighted those types of policies as a problem you're going to want to make those changes but if you've so far stayed off the National Labor Relations Board\u2019s radar, and you're not particularly inclined to pick through your employee policies to make sure that none of your language around decorum and appropriate activity and, you know, talking through the right channels in the workplace which may or may not fall foul of what the NLRB is looking at here you might want to wait until making those handbook policies. Generally, if we're asked to do an employee handbook we'll look at that kind of stuff and we'll point it out to clients and we can make a decision about whether or not they want to incorporate, or make certain changes to their policies, but because we're getting closer and closer to an election, and if the Trump administration were to come into power, I think those policies would almost certainly fall off the radar for the NLRB with respect to enforcement. It might be a time where you might want to wait to update your employee handbook until January of 2025.\u201d\n\n\n\nScott went on to talk about those two other major areas of uncertainty in the US, the FTC\u2019s non-compete rule, which is set to come into force on 4 September, if it survives legal challenge, and also Biden\u2019s plan to extend mandatory overtime pay to an estimated 4 million salaried workers. We\u2019ll be covering both of those next week so do watch this space.",

        "text": "Rules for upcoming US presidential debate include mic muting and no live audience\nThe upcoming 2024 presidential debate between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump in Atlanta, Georgia, on June 27 will see a new set of rules enforced.\n\nCNN has announced that the candidates\u2019 campaigns agreed to the new set of rules, which include mic muting.\n\nThe debate will be hosted by CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, and the broadcast is set to last 90 minutes with two commercial breaks in between. Commercial breaks have not occurred under The Commission on Presidential Debates, which has overseen the debates for over three decades, but won't this year.\n\nFor the first time since 1976, the presidential debate will not take place in front of a live audience.\n\nDetails of new rules\n\nBoth candidates agreed to have the microphones muted when it is not their turn to speak, minimizing potential for interruptions. Debates held ahead of the 2020 election included numerous interruptions by both Trump and Biden.\n\nOn par with previous years, the moderators \u201cwill use all tools at their disposal to enforce timing and ensure a civilized discussion,\u201d said CNN.\n\nStraying from previous years, there will be no opening statements from either candidate. The candidates will be given two minutes to respond to a question, with one-minute rebuttals and responses to rebuttals. The moderators also will have an extra minute they can use at their discretion. At the end of the debate, there will be a two-minute closing statement from each candidate.\n\nAccording to the network, there will be a uniform podium with positions determined via a coin flip.\n\nThe candidates won\u2019t be able to bring pre-written notes or props onto the debate stage with them, they instead will be provided with a pen, paper and water. Campaign staff are also not permitted to speak or interact with their respective candidates until the end of the debate.\n\nThe June 27 debate marks the earliest presidential debate in U.S. history, with neither candidate officially accepting their party nomination yet. Both Biden and Trump will be able to accept their nominations after their party\u2019s conventions.\n\nThe Republican Convention is in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, next month, while the Democratic Convention takes place in August in Chicago.\n\nThe debate will be the first of two scheduled to take place this year, with an ABC News-hosted presidential debate set for September 10.",

        "text": "Expert Take: How Will the Sheinbaum Presidency Impact Mexico?\nOn June 2nd, Claudia Sheinbaum, the Sigamos Haciendo Historia candidate, was elected president, making history as the first female to hold Mexico's highest elected office. While Sheinbaum's campaign platform and initial comments following her recent election closely reflected the current policy priorities of her predecessor and founder of the political party, Morena, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, much is to be determined about how a Sheinbaum presidency will impact Mexico. Eight experts share their perspectives on how Claudia Sheinbaum may impact the country's trajectory from security and rule of law, to distribution of wealth, migration, and relationship with the private sector.\n\nHow do you foresee the Sheinbaum presidency impacting the US-Mexico relationship?\n\nBy: Ambassador Earl Anthony Wayne\n\nUS-Mexico relations will be tough to manage for the months ahead and could become more challenging to guide depending on the outcome of the November US elections. Yet, there is reason to be hopeful that Claudia Sheinbaum will bring a reasoned and better-coordinated approach to engaging with the United States.\n\nOn a very basic level, current president Andres Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador (AMLO) regularly focused on feeding his domestic audience with morning press conferences during which he would often ad-lib his response to many controversial issues including those involving the US: a DEA statement about fentanyl, the State Department\u2019s Human Right\u2019s report, a critical New York Times article, or a grating statement by a member of the US Congress. President Sheinbaum will certainly defend her views and Mexico\u2019s positions, but she does not appear to be as confrontational as her soon-to-be predecessor.\n\nThose who have worked with her over the years say Sheinbaum\u2019s approach to dealing with problems tends to reflect the scientist she was trained to be -- methodical and listening seriously to a range of options. These terms rarely apply to AMLO, despite being a very skilled politician. Her problem-solving approach should establish a good basis for working through difficult issues on the US-Mexico agenda, including on cross-border crime, migration management, and trade.\n\nUnlike AMLO, who tends to view the US through the lens of Mexican domestic politics, Sheinbaum and her family members have lived in the US and know its strengths and weaknesses. This should give her and US counterparts a better opportunity to find shared solutions or identify additional channels for collaboration on big issues that arise, or at a minimum to better understand why the US may be \u201cunreasonable.\u201d Yes, this happens.\n\nSheinbaum understands that the key for Mexico\u2019s continued growth and prosperity is to stay locked into the mutual production and value chains of North America. This will open opportunities for Mexico\u2019s small and medium enterprises and attract job-creating investment and nearshoring. Sheinbaum has also already indicated an openness to pursuing renewable energy and partnering with the private sector from the US and elsewhere to attract the funding needed to develop these options for Mexico.\n\nIn tackling public security and crime, Sheinbaum demonstrated during her tenure as Mexico City mayor that she supported establishing good policing and sound capacity building to get the criminals off the streets. Her public security team worked well with US counterparts, which bodes well for better bilateral cooperation going forward. This is desperately needed.\n\nProblems and differences will remain, but I am optimistic about the prospects for good collaboration.\n\nHow do you foresee the Sheinbaum presidency impacting security and rule of law in Mexico?\n\nBy: Cecilia Farf\u00e1n-M\u00e9ndez\n\nFirst and foremost, the administration should not underestimate the magnitude of the challenge they face. Even with a slight decrease, the homicide rate in Mexico of 25.4 per 100,000 is well above the Latin America average of 15.8 per 100,000, which is the highest in the world. The forensic crisis of unidentified remains and over 100,000 disappearances is further deteriorating without meaningful resources to address it and there is a well-documented expansion of protection rackets targeting the private sector that could negatively impact nearshoring ambitions.\n\nPer her campaign statements, President Sheinbaum will continue using the Armed Forces for the provision of public security in Mexico. This is concerning because there is robust evidence that shows that this, in fact, undermines citizen security and can result in Human Rights violations, particularly for women and girls. Worryingly, the continuous militarization of public security is not a concern for the average citizen, and I believe the Sheinbaum administration will take advantage of this. Per the Survey of the Quality of Democracy in Mexico, in 2024, 69% of the population feels \u201csafe\u201d or \u201csomewhat safe\u201d using the Armed Forces against organized crime even if 51% think the Armed Forces cut deals with criminal groups and 40% do not think the Armed Forces are held accountable by civilian institutions. Importantly, the Armed Forces will likely capitalize on these high levels of trust, even if there is also perceived corruption within their ranks, to continue pushing for expanded budgets and resources to the detriment of developing civilian institutions for public security in Mexico.\n\nHow do you foresee the Sheinbaum presidency impacting relations with the private sector in Mexico?\n\nBy: Gustavo Almaraz and Mariana Raphael\n\nA Sheinbaum presidency in Mexico is poised to shape relations with the private sector through a blend of pragmatism, technical expertise, and political dynamics. Known for her openness to dialogue with businesses, Sheinbaum has a track record of fostering public-private partnerships, particularly in infrastructure and environmental initiatives during her tenure as mayor of Mexico City. This inclination suggests a collaborative approach that could benefit sectors aligned with her agenda, such as renewable energy and sustainable development.\n\nHer technical background and reliance on well-prepared advisors indicate a methodical approach to governance, likely bringing stability and predictability to regulatory frameworks. This could reassure investors and encourage long-term planning among businesses.\n\nHowever, navigating the USMCA review in 2026 will be crucial. Sheinbaum will need to balance Mexico's international trade commitments with domestic policy priorities, particularly in sectors like automotive manufacturing and agriculture.\n\nThe influence of President Lopez Obrador remains pivotal. If allowed to govern with her distinct style, Sheinbaum's presidency could chart a course characterized by proactive engagement with the private sector, leveraging her majority in Congress and at local levels to enact policies conducive to economic growth and social equity. This alignment of political support provides a strong foundation for effective governance, potentially fostering an environment where businesses thrive under a balanced regulatory framework.\n\nUltimately, while challenges and opportunities will arise, Sheinbaum's presidency has the potential to redefine private-sector relations in Mexico through collaboration, technical expertise, and strategic governance.\n\nHow do you foresee the Sheinbaum presidency addressing the challenges of migration?\n\nBy: Carlos Heredia\n\nMexico militarized its immigration policy during AMLO\u2019s term (2018-2024), heavily influenced by U.S. national security concerns. The promised humanitarian approach to migration and human rights never materialized. The total impunity of high government officials after the incineration of 40 migrants in a government facility in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez on March 27, 2023, is AMLO\u2019s legacy: migrants in transit through Mexico are used as a bargaining chip to be traded away for political expediency.\n\nWith significant assistance from the United Nations, asylum and refuge were the only responsibilities that this government seemed to deliver, but that department was permanently understaffed and underfunded.\n\nPresident Biden\u2019s June 5th, 2024 decree to unilaterally redefine asylum and refuge will bring a larger number of asylum seekers stranded in Mexico, where significant segments of our territory are controlled by organized crime.\n\nIronically, while some in Mexico, the United States, and Canada describe North America as the most competitive region in the world, the rights of Mexican undocumented migrants in the U.S. are not guaranteed. Now that the three countries experience a shortage of workers, a blueprint to regulate labor mobility is needed, even against the political odds.\n\nFuture president Sheinbaum says she will address the root causes of migration in Mexico and the region, but key officials in her administration starting October 1st, are already discussing the continuity of militarized immigration containment. Her huge victory at the polls means no incentive for change, so beyond the speeches, I do not foresee a departure from current practices.\n\nHow do you foresee the Sheinbaum presidency impacting Mexico's energy sector?\n\nBy: Alejandra Le\u00f3n\n\nClaudia Sheinbaum approaches energy with a distinct perspective from the current administration. While many perceive her policies as a continuation of L\u00f3pez Obrador's, her true focus lies in expediting the energy transition. Her rhetoric suggests a continuation of the existing energy policy for the next six years, including controlled increases in gasoline, electricity, and LPG prices, strengthening of Pemex and CFE, maintaining 54% power generation by CFE, upgrading existing refineries, utilizing the Olmeca refinery for self-sufficiency, advancing Plan Sonora, and refraining from fracking for hydrocarbon production. However, Sheinbaum's rhetoric also highlights her commitment to energy transition through the construction of renewable plants, distributed energy systems, solar heaters for residential and commercial use, support for petrochemicals and fertilizers, and the promotion of electromobility in major cities. The logic behind this rhetoric is a topic for another debate.\n\nNonetheless, Sheinbaum acknowledges the reality that replacing hydrocarbons within a six-year timeframe necessitates substantial financial resources. Not only must new energy supplies be built, but consumers must also be incentivized to make the switch. In the best-case scenario, she can meet the expected moderate growth in energy demand with clean energy sources. However, securing private capital efficiently remains a challenge. It is crucial to avoid corruption, obtain cost-efficient technology in a timely manner, and comply with the restrictions imposed by commercial partners. Furthermore, the investment synergy resulting from the 2013 energy reform has largely dissipated. Of note, China is the leader in the supply chain of renewable energy and electromobility; increasing trade and investment from China will increase economic risk during the USMCA revision in 2026. Between 2016 and 2023 Mexico increased an average 6% per year its exports to the US, the same growth rate as Mexican imports from China.\n\nConsidering these factors, it remains unclear how Sheinbaum intends to achieve sufficient, affordable, and clean energy to benefit the Mexican population and enhance Mexico's competitiveness. There are significant obstacles to overcome in realizing her vision.\n\nHow do you foresee the Sheinbaum presidency impacting pending plans for judicial reform?\n\nBy: Alexandra Helfgott\n\nReform to Mexico\u2019s judicial system has been a significant priority for AMLO, but previous efforts have not been successful. Yet, given Morena and its allies\u2019 dominance in both chambers of Congress, AMLO has promised to present the proposed judicial reform to the newly-elected Congress in September, before he leaves office on October 1 \u2013 a final act of his presidency. Though the exact nature of the judicial reform is evolving (it is certain to include the direct, popular election of members of the judicial branch \u2013 scale and scope to be determined), and whether the legislation will ultimately pass is still undecided, mere discussions of the pending reform have already had implications, such as the peso\u2019s nearly 2% drop in value following Sheinbaum\u2019s comments promising to pursue the reform shortly after the election.\n\nThe passage of this reform would further politicize Mexico\u2019s judicial branch, incentivize actions that favor popularity, rather than judicial wellbeing and expertise, and would do little, if anything, to address issues of corruption \u2013 the purported primary purpose of the reform. Not only would the passage of the judicial reform represent a direct threat to democracy and rule of law in Mexico, but more concretely, it would also have significant implications for the country\u2019s competitiveness, particularly when it comes to foreign investment. Both current and former US government officials have commented that the passage of this reform would undoubtedly affect the US-Mexico relationship, particularly as the USMCA\u2019s 2026 review looms on the horizon. Sheinbaum, for her part, has sought to assuage concerns about the pending reform, emphasizing the strength of Mexico\u2019s economy and also promising to hold public consultations throughout the summer on the judicial reform \u2013 though AMLO has already said that the reform will be approved in September.\n\nHow do you foresee the Sheinbaum presidency addressing the challenges of climate change and the environment?\n\nBy: Tania Miranda\n\nClaudia Sheinbaum, an engineer and climate scientist, is viewed by many as the President who will finally prioritize climate change on Mexico\u2019s national agenda. As the country grapples with climate emergencies, including heat stress, water scarcity, and devastating hurricanes, the need for decisive action has never been more urgent. However, her alignment with her predecessor's rhetoric may pose challenges for Mexico's first female President.\n\nDespite the importance of biodiversity in a megadiverse country like Mexico, it is noticeably absent from Sheinbaum's plans. Her campaign platform mentioned biodiversity only once, in the context of food sovereignty. There was no reference to natural protected areas (NPAs), and the environmental section focused mainly on water basin recovery and water access, with only a brief mention of reforestation and forest protection. Moreover, she supports the Tren Maya infrastructure project, which threatens important biodiversity hotspots of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.\n\nOn a positive note, Sheinbaum appears committed to expanding renewable energy sources and distributed generation. She also plans to invest in the decarbonization of the transportation sector through electromobility, which could significantly improve air quality and mitigate climate change, as the energy sector\u2014including power generation and transportation fuels\u2014accounts for over 60% of the country\u2019s CO2 emissions. However, energy is just one part of the equation. In Mexico, 36% of CO2 emissions and the majority of other potent greenhouse gases (GHGs) originate from other sectors, such as agriculture and livestock.\n\nSheinbaum is expected to continue supporting the national utility CFE and the national oil company Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos, both of which lag in the energy transition and could divert valuable resources. Additionally, she will need to decide whether to permit the expansion of U.S.-owned LNG export terminals along Mexico\u2019s coasts, which could substantially increase GHG emissions.\n\nGiven her involvement in drafting key UN climate reports, it is assumed that she will take Mexico\u2019s international climate commitments seriously, including the Paris Agreement\u2019s Nationally Determined Contributions and the 30x30 goal from the Global Biodiversity Framework. Her cabinet appointments and Mexico\u2019s participation in upcoming biodiversity and climate summits this October and November will provide insights into her environmental agenda. We will see what tomorrow brings, but it is the responsibility of all of us working on climate issues to encourage her to move forward with the net-zero transition, in a political environment that moves in the opposite direction.",

These new slogans often package massive policy proposals and talking points into a couple of words \u2014 and Trump often uses them with little context.\n\nThese sayings offer a glimpse into the former president\u2019s goals and priorities this election year.\n\nHere are six of Trump\u2019s most common catchphrases and where they come from:\n\n\n\nToo Big to Rig\n\nTrump still falsely maintains that Democrats stole the presidential election in 2020 through voter fraud. However, Trump is now promoting mail-in ballots and voter registration, both of which he criticized Democrats for in 2020, in order to make his margins \u201cToo Big to Rig.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nTrump lost the 2020 election in margins in the thousands in several crucial swing states, but he believes that Democrats cannot \u201crig\u201d the 2024 election if enough Republicans show up to the ballot box in November. Proven instances of election fraud are rare in U.S. elections.\n\nThe \u201cToo Big to Rig\u201d phrase now takes up prime real estate on political signs at Trump\u2019s rallies, a reminder to his fiercely loyal supporters of the importance of voting.\n\ntoggle caption Caitlin O'Hara for NPR\n\nSwamp the Vote\n\nUsed in conjunction with \u201cToo Big to Rig,\u201d \u201cSwamp the Vote\u201d calls for Trump supporters to vote en masse.\n\nThe initiative, officially titled Swamp the Vote USA, encourages voters to vote absentee, by mail, early in person, or on Election Day.\n\n\u201cIf we swamp them, they can\u2019t cheat, it just doesn\u2019t work out,\u201d Trump said in a June 4 video posted to his account on Truth Social, Trump\u2019s social media website.\n\n\u201cSwamp\u201d is a particularly notorious term for Trump, who ran in 2016 on the campaign promise of \u201cDraining the Swamp\u201d of special interests in the federal government. The word in a political context often references the belief that Washington is corruptwith old money, lobbying and term-limit schemes.\n\n\n\nDrill, Baby, Drill\n\nTrump did not invent this term, but he has started to revive its relevance in recent months. Former Republican vice presidential candidate and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin popularized \u201cDrill, Baby, Drill\u201d on the 2008 campaign trail with her then-running mate, the late Arizona Sen. John McCain, as a way to promote pro-oil drilling and fracking policies.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nTrump has started to use the term more frequently in public appearances, but his use dates back to at least 2022. Trump claims that if elected, he will cut energy prices in half, doing so through expanding domestic fracking and oil measures.\n\nHowever, companies set production levels based on market forces, not presidential orders. Efforts to influence production are not guaranteed to succeed: Trump tried and failed to prop up the U.S. coal industry for example.\n\n\n\nNo Tax on Tips\n\nTrump announced at a June 9 rally that if reelected president, he would attempt to end taxes on tips for those in the service industry. \u201cThose people that have jobs in restaurants, whatever the job may be, a tipping job, we\u2019re not going after for taxes anymore,\u201d Trump said at the rally.\n\nService workers are required by federal law to report tip earnings on their tax forms, which are then taxed as normal income. Trump would need Congress to act in order to change the practice.\n\nTrump has since made several posts on Truth Social with the moniker.\n\n\n\nNever Surrender\n\nTrump has faced numerous inquiries, trials and criminal probes, ranging from the Jan. 6 insurrection to hush money to the alleged mishandling of classified documents. In each case, Trump maintains that he is not guilty, but he was recently convicted on 34 felony counts by a jury in his New York hush money trial.\n\nTrump falsely claims that these trials are a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d by the Biden administration. While the Justice Department oversees the Jan. 6 and classified documents cases, state justice officials handle the others. In the federal cases, the Justice Department maintains its independence from the White House.\n\n\u201cNever Surrender\u201d comes from the idea that Trump will not surrender, either in court or metaphorically, to his political adversaries. Trump has vowed to not let these trials drag him down, instead making them a cornerstone of his reelection campaign.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe phrase occupies an entire themed section on his web store, complete with greyscale T-shirts, mugs and hats, many of which showcase his mugshot from his indictment in the Georgia election case.\n\ntoggle caption David Dee Delgado/Getty Images\n\nMake America Greater than Ever Before\n\nTrump forever altered the political landscape of the modern Republican party during the 2016 election with the renaissance of the Reagan-era trademark slogan \u201cMake America Great Again\" (MAGA), which Trump still uses in spades. However, the phrase also includes an important tail-end that has appeared since 2016.\n\nTrump often ends promotional videos and appearances by saying \u201cMake America Greater than Ever Before.\u201d \u201cAgain\u201d marks a return to a past standard, while \u201cever before\u201d implies reaching new heights. With this phrase, Trump wants to convince voters that a second presidential term would usher in a level of social and economic prosperity that America has never seen.\n\nIt is certainly the case that Trump has more material to pull from than \u201cever before.\u201d",

        "text": "Anticipating Justice: The US Supreme Court\u2019s upcoming decisions and public mobilization\nJune marks not only the beginning of the summer season but also the end of the current Supreme Court term. Over the past eight months, the nine justices have heard over 60 cases and made decisions on nearly half of them. While the court will continue to release decisions over the coming weeks, several cases may spark demonstrations. The court is expected to release decisions connected to gun rights, abortion access, and former President Donald Trump\u2019s claim to immunity \u2014 issues that have recently garnered a lot of attention from activists and continue to drive mobilization in the United States.\n\nGun rights\n\nWhile the court has already decided on one gun rights case this term, deciding to strike down a ban on bump stocks, there is still one more gun rights-related case left to be decided. On 7 November, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments for United States v. Rahimi, which could have pivotal implications for who can own firearms. At the center of the case is Zackey Rahimi, a Texas man who claims his constitutional rights were infringed after the state revoked his handgun license and barred him from having firearms in his possession after a protective order was filed against him for domestic violence in 2020. Rahimi was then indicted for violating the federal law that prohibited him from owning guns after police found firearms in his home. Rahimi had pleaded guilty to the charges and was initially sentenced to six years in prison. However, after the court\u2019s decision in the 2022 case, New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. v. Bruen, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that even individuals under protective orders were still covered by the Second Amendment and thus allowed to possess firearms.\n\nThe New York State Bar Association has claimed that the Bruen decision would result in significant changes to gun regulations across the country, particularly in states such as New York with more stringent gun control. New York was one of seven states that were considered \u201cmay issue\u201d states prior to the Supreme Court decision \u2014 meaning that citizens could be denied a carrying permit unless they showed a \u201cspecial need\u201d or \u201cproper cause\u201d to carry a firearm outside of the home. The high court\u2019s 6-3 decision overturned the long-standing New York law and subsequently led to a flurry of challenges to gun laws across the country. The opinion, written by Justice Clarence Thomas, argued that restrictions placed on the Second Amendment could be upheld only if there was a history of such regulation. He found no historical basis for New York\u2019s law. The Bruen decision opened the door for lower courts to reexamine, and often invalidate, previous convictions and regulations on firearms.\n\nThe 5th Circuit\u2019s decision in the Rahimi case ultimately struck down federal laws that prohibit gun possession for those under a restraining order for domestic violence. Opponents of the 5th Circuit\u2019s decision have expressed concern that removing such regulations could allow for a spike in violence. The Battered Women\u2019s Justice Project argues that regulations such as background checks and red-flag laws have prevented, since they were introduced in 1998, over 77,000 gun purchases by individuals with domestic violence restraining orders. The presence of a firearm is reported to increase the rate of homicide by more than six times in domestic violence cases.\n\nBeyond the implications for domestic violence, a victory for Rahimi could open the door for future challenges to firearm regulation. Less restrictions on gun ownership could also increase the likelihood that citizens bring arms to demonstrations. ACLED analysis has found that even a single armed individual present increases the likelihood of a demonstration turning violent or destructive.\n\nGun access has long been a contributing driver of mobilization across the political spectrum. However, while firearm regulations are a partisan issue, there are stark divides even within the political parties: Non-gun owners are more likely to favor restrictions on gun access compared with gun owners, regardless of party affiliation. Over the past few years, pro- and anti-gun activists have held demonstrations in the wake of mass shootings, most notably those that targeted schools in Uvalde, Texas, and Nashville (see graph below).\n\nAbortion access\n\nThe Supreme Court is also poised to make landmark decisions on two key abortion access cases heard this term. The court recently dismissed Food and Drug Administration v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, ruling that the plaintiff group lacked legal standing. This ruling means mifepristone, a drug prescribed in two doses and used in over 60% of abortions in the United States, will still be available. FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine was the first abortion-related decision since 2022\u2019s Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade. Although mifepristone will remain accessible, many legal scholars have argued that the court left the door open for future cases to threaten access to abortion.\n\nAnother case before the high court, Idaho v. United States, could limit hospitals\u2019 ability to provide abortion care during emergencies. This case originated in August 2022 with Idaho\u2019s Defense of Life Act, which prohibited nearly all abortions in the state. The Biden administration argued that the law conflicts with the federal mandate, the Emergency Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA). EMTALA ensures that people have access to emergency medical services, such as stabilizing care, regardless of their ability to pay. The justices will now need to decide if the Idaho law violates EMTALA although the federal act does not specifically mention abortion.\n\nThe decision in the Idaho v. United States case could also be consequential for abortion access across the country. While there has been less mobilization surrounding abortion access in recent months, pro-abortion rights demonstrators have been highly responsive to legal moves to restrict abortion access in recent years (see graph below). Earlier this year, anti-abortion activists held nationwide rallies during the annual March for Life in January, suggesting a likelihood of continued mobilization around abortion access on both sides of the issue, especially in several swing states like Arizona and Wisconsin.\n\nAbortion is one of the most important issues for voters in the upcoming election, with polling suggesting that it is an especially high priority for younger voters and women. Of particular interest, a Wall Street Journal poll found that abortion was the No. 1 issue for suburban women in swing states, aligning with recent activity surrounding abortion-related protests in the swing states. The importance for voters, combined with the high stakes of both cases, suggests the potential for an increase in abortion-related protests after the court releases its decisions later this month. If the court\u2019s ruling signals further restrictions to abortion access, there could be a spike in protests, as was seen after the 2022 decision overturning Roe.\n\nTrump immunity case\n\nWhile the other cases discussed here have been tied to the rights of everyday citizens, the last case of utmost importance in the upcoming election focuses on Trump\u2019s claim to immunity for his actions in the Capitol riot on 6 January 2021. This case has been billed as possibly one of the most consequential before the court this term, as the outcome will likely decide if proceedings in the case, brought by special counsel Jack Smith over Trump\u2019s role in the Capitol riot, can proceed. If the case is allowed to move forward, Trump will face four felony charges for his alleged attempt to block President Joe Biden\u2019s victory in 2020. Before Trump\u2019s claim to absolute immunity was heard in the Supreme Court, his lawyers argued before the DC Circuit, a federal appeals court, that presidents are immune from prosecution, even if they are accused of murder while in office.\n\nThe case is also set against a backdrop of questions surrounding justices and their ability to remain impartial. Members of Congress have called for Justice Samuel Alito to recuse himself from the case over flags displayed at two of his properties. Neighbors reported that during the Capitol riot, an inverted American flag, which at that time was used as a symbol of pro-Trump/anti-Biden sentiment, was flying outside Alito\u2019s Virginia home. More recently, the \u2018An Appeal to Heaven\u2019 flag \u2014 linked to Christian Nationalism and the claim that the 2020 election was stolen \u2014 was seen flying outside Alito\u2019s vacation home in New Jersey. Democrats in Congress have also called for Justice Thomas to recuse himself over his wife\u2019s previous efforts to reverse Biden\u2019s 2020 win and her attendance at the 6 January 2021 Trump rally. Both justices have refused to recuse themselves from the trial, causing some to question their ability to remain impartial.\n\nThese legal problems are not the only concerns for Trump, who was recently found guilty on all 34 felony counts in a hush money case in New York City. After the verdict, Trump supporters took to pro-Trump websites and forums to call for protests and violence in response. Their response is similar to what was seen after the 2020 election, although it was not reflected in any significant mobilization. Despite an increase in the number of pro-Trump/anti-Biden rallies since the summer of 2023, Trump\u2019s legal cases have failed to mobilize demonstrations over the past year. The strongest response that summer came about in the wake of his indictment over the mishandling of legal documents in Mar-a-Lago in June 2023 (see graph below). After Trump\u2019s latest conviction in New York City, around 10 rallies expressing support for the former president took place, two of which were reportedly convened by the Proud Boys.",

        "text": "How could the US presidential election impact the US dollar?\n[author: Katie Keith]\n\nNumerous countries are holding elections in 2024, but none are likely to have as far-reaching an impact at this year\u2019s US Presidential election.\n\nThe stakes are high not only for domestic policies but also for the global economy. Given its status as the world\u2019s primary reserve currency, the election\u2019s impact on the US dollar may be felt across the globe.\n\nBut how exactly will the expected contest between Joe Biden and Donald Trump in 2024 influence the trajectory of the US dollar in the coming months?\n\nHow has the US dollar performed under President Biden?\n\nSince taking office in January 2021, Biden has pursued an expansionary fiscal policy, including significant infrastructure spending and stimulus measures.\n\nThis initially contributed to a weaker US dollar through 2021, before the sharp acceleration of inflation in 2022 propelled USD exchange rates to a 20-year high as the Federal Reserve was forced to start tightening its monetary policy.\n\nThe effectiveness of Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) subsequently led to a moderation and stabilization of the US dollar through 2023, but ultimately USD exchange rates remain higher than when Biden first took office.\n\nWho is likely to win?\n\nThis time last year it seemed that Biden would comfortably beat Trump in a rematch of the 2020 election.\n\nHowever, less than six months out from the election, national polls suggest that Biden and Trump are virtually neck-and-neck.\n\nThis comes amid an eroding of Biden\u2019s support base, with younger voters growing despondent over the President\u2019s handling of the conflict in Gaza.\n\nOn a state-by-state basis, polls suggest Trump is leading in a number of battleground states, which may be key to swinging the election in the Republican\u2019s favour, although pollsters point out this is well within bounds of statistical error.\n\nHowever, Trump\u2019s legal woes remain a major concern for the former president, and a formal conviction could derail his 2024 campaign.\n\nHow could the election impact the US dollar?\n\nA general rule of thumb is that investors are not fans of political uncertainty. Therefore, the US presidential election and its aftermath are likely to bring about increased volatility in USD, particularly if the polling numbers remain close.\n\nAs for how victory for each candidate may impact the US dollar, it\u2019s difficult to say, however, looking at how previous election results impacted USD exchange rates may offer us some insight.\n\nBiden victory\n\nThe continuity and stability offered by a second term for Biden may be welcomed by USD investors, at least in the short-term.\n\nLonger term the focus will be on Biden\u2019s domestic priorities, particularly regarding his fiscal policy.\n\nPlans for increased government spending, particularly on healthcare, education, and renewable energy initiatives could lead to higher deficits and increased borrowing, potentially putting downward pressure on the US dollar if not matched by sufficient economic growth.\n\nOn the other hand, such policies could also stoke inflationary pressures within the US. This could strengthen the US dollar if it pushes the Federal Reserve to maintain its restrictive monetary policy for longer.\n\nElsewhere, if the Biden administration follows through with promises to raise taxes for corporations and the wealthy, could a flight of capital trigger some weakness in the US dollar?\n\nTrump victory\n\nWhile markets might initially welcome a Trump victory due to expectations of pro-business policies, ongoing trade disputes and geopolitical tensions could infuse significant volatility into the US dollar. During his first term, Trump pursued a more protectionist trade policy, which led to trade tensions with several countries, most notably China.\n\nThese tensions and the associated tariffs had mixed effects on the US dollar, as they simultaneously increased uncertainty and boosted demand for safe-haven assets.\n\nIf Trump were to win a second term, it is expected that his administration would continue to prioritise protectionist policies, which may lead to further trade disputes and geopolitical tensions.\n\nSuch an environment could result in increased volatility for the US dollar, as investors react to changing trade dynamics and assess the potential impact on global economic growth.",

        "text": "Biden-Trump 2024 presidential debate: What to know and how to watch \u2013 NBC10 Philadelphia\nThe first presidential debate of the 2024 election cycle is set for Thursday, when President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump will take the stage.\n\nThis month's presidential debate will be historic in that it was not organized by the Commission on Presidential Debates, a bipartisan organization that has managed the presidential debates since the 1988 presidential election.\n\nHere is everything you need to know about the upcoming 2024 presidential debate:\n\nWhen is the first presidential debate?\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nThe first presidential debate will take place on Thursday, June 27 at 9 p.m. EST.\n\nHow to watch the first presidential debate?\n\nThe first presidential debate will air on CNN and be streamed on Max.\n\nWill there be an audience at the first presidential debate?\n\nThe first presidential debate will take place in CNN's Atlanta studios and will not feature an audience.\n\n\"To ensure candidates may maximize the time allotted in the debate, no audience will be present,\" CNN said in a press release.\n\nWho will moderate the first presidential debate?\n\nThe first presidential debate will be moderated by CNN anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash.\n\nWhy is the first presidential debate in June?\n\nTraditionally, presidential debates have taken place in the fall, with three debates scheduled between September and October.\n\nBut this year, the Trump and Biden campaigns decided to hold a debate earlier in the election cycle to get it in before early and mail-in voting begins.\n\nThe debate is being organized by CNN, which sent out invitations to Trump and Biden. Independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has failed to qualify for the debate after not meeting CNN's requirements for who could attend. The move excluded the Commission for Presidential Debates, which had scheduled three debates in the fall.\n\nIs the presidential debate mandatory?\n\nNo. There is nothing in the Constitution that mentions presidential debates and Congress has not passed a law requiring them. However, debates have become a traditional part of modern American politics.\n\nWill there be a second presidential debate?\n\nTrump and Biden have both agreed to do a second presidential debate on Sept. 10, which will be hosted by ABC News.",

Debs campaigned from a prison cell more than a century ago has the United States experienced what is now happening: a prominent candidate with felony convictions running for president. And never before has that candidate been someone with a real chance of winning.\n\nA Manhattan jury convicted former President Donald J. Trump in May of falsifying business records to cover up a hush-money payment to a porn star. He has been charged with dozens of other felonies across three additional cases: two federal and one in Georgia.\n\nFor now, he faces no formal campaign restrictions, and he remains highly competitive in polls. But his sentencing on the New York convictions is approaching, on July 11, the other cases are still looming, and the Constitution and U.S. law have clear answers for only some of the questions that have arisen and may still arise.\n\nOthers could bring the country into truly uncharted territory, with huge decisions resting in the hands of federal judges.",

The Kennedy campaign has poured millions into getting on the ballot in all 50 states, each of which has different rules for independent candidates.\n\nThe campaign says it has collected enough petition signatures to get on the ballot in 23 states, totalling 310 electoral votes.\n\nHowever, the campaign acknowledges that only nine states \u2013 totalling just 144 electoral votes - have actually confirmed that RFK Jr will appear on the ballot.\n\nThe Kennedy campaign has lodged a complaint with the FEC, arguing that Mr Biden and Trump have not yet been nominated by their respective parties and thus are not officially on the ballot in any states.\n\nThe campaign has accused CNN of failing to apply objective criteria in deciding who makes the debate stage and have alleged that the broadcast next Thursday amounts to a prohibited \u201ccampaign contribution\u201d.\n\nCNN has said that Mr Kennedy\u2019s complaints are baseless. The broadcaster declined to comment when reached by the BBC on Thursday.",

        "text": "KFF Survey of Women Voters: Key Takeaways\nThe KFF Survey of Women Voters examines the attitudes, motivations, and voting intentions of women voters nationally\u2014and in two battleground states, Arizona and Michigan\u2014fewer than six months prior to the 2024 election. This project was intentionally designed to provide insights into the largest, and very diverse, dynamic, and influential voting group in this country: women.\n\nWomen voters will play a pivotal role in determining the outcome of the 2024 presidential and down-ballot elections, including the future of abortion access in many states. And while women voters constitute a majority of all voters in most elections, they are a diverse voting bloc with varying opinions and experiences across partisanship, race and ethnicity, and age. This survey is unique in its ability to report on a nationally representative sample of some of the most important groups of women voters including Black women voters, Hispanic women voters, women voters across age groups including those of reproductive age (ages 18-49), women voters by partisanship, and White women (who are the largest group of voters, representing about two-fifths of the total electorate, but rarely vote as a monolith).\n\nAs voters weigh their options for the presidency and Congress, as well as decide the future of abortion access in some states through ballot initiatives, the KFF Survey of Women Voters highlights the deciding factors for women voters this fall. The results presented below are from a multi-mode survey of more than 3,000 women voters from state registration voter files, including 1,383 women voters living across the U.S. as well as 928 women voters in Arizona and 876 Michigan women voters. The KFF Survey of Women Voters Dashboard includes more data from the survey, as well as the topline and methodology. View all reports from this survey.\n\nKey Takeaways From the National Poll\n\nAny path to the presidency for either President Biden or former President Trump requires maintaining the support they received among segments of women voters in 2020 and gaining votes among other groups of women voters. A path to victory for President Biden would need to include strong support from Black women voters, as well as support among Hispanic women voters and suburban women. A path to victory for former President Trump necessitates motivating Republican women to turn out as well as making gains among groups that haven\u2019t voted for him in previous elections. The KFF Survey of Women Voters points to a close presidential election where small shifts in voter turnout or voting across the political aisle could make a big difference in determining the outcome of the race.\n\nMost Women Voters Are Frustrated and Anxious About the Presidential Race, Say They Are Unsatisfied with their Options\n\nWomen voters are not overly enthusiastic about the upcoming 2024 presidential election, with six in ten saying they aren\u2019t satisfied with their choices for president and one in five (21%) saying they are \u201cless motivated\u201d to vote in this election compared to previous ones. More than one in four independent women voters (31%), Black women voters (28%), and Hispanic women voters (27%) say they are less motivated to vote this year. More than half of these groups of women, who both candidates hope to persuade, say they are not satisfied with their options for president including more than three-fourths of independent women voters. Check out the dashboard to see why women voters say they are dissatisfied with their choices for president.\n\nMost women voters say they feel \u201cfrustrated\u201d or \u201canxious\u201d about the upcoming presidential election. Far fewer say they are \u201chopeful\u201d (53%) or \u201centhusiastic\u201d (33%). But this doesn\u2019t mean they are apathetic; only one in five women voters say they are \u201cuninterested\u201d in the election. The poll suggests Republican women are slightly more motivated to vote (53% say this compared to 44% of Democratic women voters) and more likely to report feeling hopeful and enthusiastic about the election.\n\nBiden Supporters Prioritize Candidate Characteristics, Trump Supporters Say They Are Voting on the Issues\n\nVoters make decisions about which candidates to support based on a variety of factors, but most women voters who plan to vote for former President Trump say their support isn\u2019t necessarily based on his leadership ability, character, values, or experience. Rather, half of women who plan to vote for Trump say the candidates\u2019 stances on specific issues will make the biggest difference in how they vote. By comparison, two-thirds of women who plan to vote for President Biden say the candidates\u2019 personal characteristics matter most to their vote. With both presidential candidates well-known to the electorate, it appears many women voters, namely Black women voters, Hispanic women voters, and older women voters, say the candidates\u2019 leadership ability, character, values, and experience are driving their decisions. These are all groups that President Biden is hoping will turn out in support of his candidacy, but currently he is garnering larger shares of support only among Black women. While President Biden currently has an advantage among younger women voters, ages 18 to 29, this group values candidates\u2019 stances on specific issues and personal characteristics similarly.\n\nTurning Out the Base Will Be Key for Both Presidential Candidates\n\nHalf of the most consistent women voters, those who have routinely shown up to vote in the past three elections (if they were age eligible in 2016) including the 2022 midterm election, say they plan on voting for President Biden \u2013 suggesting that, encouraging these routine voters to turn out could be an important part of his strategy. But support for President Biden among younger Democratic women may be weaker. Former President Trump has support among the vast majority of Republican women regardless of age, something that isn\u2019t mirrored for President Biden and his support among Democratic women. About nine in ten Republican women ages 18 to 49, and 50 and older say they plan on voting for former President Trump. In comparison, while nine in ten Democratic women ages 50 and older say they plan on voting for President Biden, this drops to a smaller majority (77%) of Democratic women ages 18 to 49 \u2013 which could matter in states with close presidential races.\n\nA majority (70%) of Black women voters \u2013 a group that President Biden won overwhelmingly in 2020 (90% of Black women voters voted for President Biden according to exit polls), say they plan on voting for President Biden, but now about one in six say they may either stay home on Election Day or vote for a third-party candidate.\n\nIn addition, while most women who voted in 2020 say they are going to pick the same candidate this year, about one in six women who voted for Biden in 2020 say they will either not vote or will vote for a different candidate this year, including 7% who say they plan to vote for former President Trump. By contrast, just 1% of women voters who voted for Trump in 2020 say they plan on voting for Biden in 2024.\n\nInflation Dominates Top Issues For Women Voters; Younger Women Voters Also Identify U.S. Involvement in the War Between Israel and Hamas in Gaza as a Voting Concern\n\nFour in ten women voters say inflation is the most important issue determining their vote in the 2024 presidential race. This is followed by about one in five (22%) who say threats to democracy is the most salient issue for them. Fewer say immigration and border security (13%), abortion (10%), gun policy (4%), the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza (3%), or the war in Ukraine (1%) are the most important issues for them headed into this election. While inflation is among the top voting issues for many key groups of women voters (including Black women, Hispanic women, younger women, Democratic women, and Republican women overall) there are differences in issue priority not only by partisanship, but also age.\n\nFor example, women voters ages 50 and older are divided by partisanship on their top voting issue. More than a third of older Republican women cite immigration (36%) and inflation (37%) as their top issue, while half of older Democratic women say \u201cthreats to democracy\u201d is the most important issue determining their vote. Democratic women overall, are more likely than Republican women and independent women to say threats to democracy are their most important voting issue. Click here to see the ranking of voting issues among various groups of women voters.\n\nIn addition to ranking inflation as a top issue, many women voters also say they worry about the cost of everyday expenses, and large shares do not trust either political party to handle the rising costs they face. This emphasis on inflation is especially notable given that many within President Biden\u2019s base don\u2019t approve of his handling of this issue. Nearly half of Democratic women voters overall and, within Democratic voters, most younger women (72%), Black women (55%), Hispanic women (57%), and lower-income women (55%) do not approve of how President Biden is handling inflation.\n\nWhile not a top issue for women voters overall, there are signs that the war between Israel and Hamas may be a weakness for Biden among his base, particularly younger women. About half of Democratic women voters disapprove of President Biden\u2019s handling of the U.S. involvement in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, increasing to more than eight in ten (83%) younger women, ages 18 to 29 who identify as Democrats.\n\nWhile President Biden has an overall advantage over former President Trump among younger women voters, a majority of younger Democratic women are unsatisfied with their options for president, and when asked why they were unsatisfied with Biden as the Democratic nominee, 16% offered responses related to the loss of life in the conflict and ongoing U.S. military aid to Israel. See the dashboard to learn what younger women voters say on this issue. Majorities of Democratic women voters approve of how President Biden is handling other key issues such as student loan repayments, health care affordability, abortion and reproductive health, and immigration.\n\nA large majority of Republican women approve of the way former President Trump\u2019s handled various issues during his time as president. See the dashboard here for more information.\n\nAbortion and Reproductive Health\n\nTwo years after the Supreme Court Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade, the KFF Survey of Women Voters finds age, partisanship, and state dynamics all play a role in whether the issue of abortion is motivating voters in the upcoming election.\n\nPro-Choice, Younger Women Are More Likely than Counterparts to say Abortion Is the Most Important Issue Determining Their Vote\n\nWhile not the top voting issue for any group of women voters, one in ten women voters say abortion is the most important issue determining their vote. This includes 12% of Black women voters, 11% of White women voters, 7% of Hispanic women voters. The issue also resonates more with younger women voters, with 13% of women voters of reproductive age (ages 18 to 49) saying abortion is their most important voting issue, increasing to one in five women voters ages 18 to 29.\n\nIn a reversal of the make-up of abortion voters in the past several presidential elections, Democrats are now more likely than Republicans to say abortion is the most important issue in their presidential voting decision (13% v. 7%). This is especially true of Democrats living in states with laws restricting abortion. Nearly one in six (15%) Democratic women voters living in states where abortion is banned or limited say abortion is their most important voting issue. Less than one in ten Republicans, regardless of where they live, say the same. Overall, three in four voters who say abortion is their top issue identify as pro-choice (compared to 67% of all women voters) and about half want abortion to be legal in all cases (compared to 36% of all women voters).\n\nMany of these voters expect changes to federal laws on abortion after the election \u2013 especially if former President Trump is elected. More than half of abortion voters (58%) say if former President Trump is elected for a second term, it is \u201cvery likely\u201d he will sign a federal law banning abortion in the U.S. after 15 weeks. A third (36%) of abortion voters say it is \u201cvery likely\u201d that President Biden will sign a law granting a federal right to abortion until the point of fetal viability if he is elected.\n\nRegardless of whether it is the most important issue in their presidential vote, most women voters say that the stakes of this election are high when it comes to future reproductive health access. Half of women (54%) say they think this year\u2019s presidential election will have a \u201cmajor impact\u201d on access to abortion and reproductive health care in the U.S and four in ten (43%) say this year\u2019s presidential election will have a \u201cmajor impact\u201d on abortion and reproductive health care in their own state.\n\nOverall, half (52%) of women voters, including at least six in ten of those ages 18 to 29 (62%) and Democratic women (63%), and half of independent women voters (54%) say the presidential candidates haven\u2019t spent enough time talking about abortion policy during this election. A smaller share (36%) of Republican women say the same \u2013 indicating an opportunity for President Biden in upcoming presidential debates. Vice President Harris has largely been front-and-center on this issue, a strategy that seems supported by most Democratic women with about eight in ten saying they trust her to speak about abortion policy, as do about nine in ten voters who say abortion is their most important voting issue.\n\nMore Than Half of Democratic Women Living in States Where Abortion May Be on the Ballot Say They Are More Motivated To Vote, and Say They Plan on Voting for President Biden\n\nAs of mid-June, there are 10 states where voters may be deciding on abortion access on Election Day. Democratic women voters living in states where abortion may be on the ballot are more likely than those in other states to say that this year\u2019s presidential election will have a major impact on access to abortion and reproductive health care in their state. Additionally, more than half (53%) say they are \u201cmore motivated\u201d to vote in this year\u2019s presidential election while more than half (57%) of Democrats living in states where abortion is not on the ballot say they are just as motivated or less motivated.\n\nAnd eight in ten (83%) Democratic women living in states where abortion may be on the ballot say they are \u201cabsolutely certain\u201d to vote this year \u2013 suggesting that abortion-related ballot measures may encourage some Democratic voters to turnout, as was the case in the 2022 midterm elections following the Dobbs decision.\n\nIn fact, Democratic women living in states where abortion may be on the ballot are more likely than Democratic women living in other states to say they plan on voting for President Biden (92% v. 82%). One in ten Democratic women living in states without abortion on the ballot say they either don\u2019t plan on voting or plan on voting for a third-party candidate. While President Biden seems to have a voting advantage among this group, it is not just because they are more favorable towards him broadly. Democratic women voters living in states where abortion may be on the ballot are no more positive in their assessments of President Biden and are just as likely to say they are unsatisfied with their options for president.\n\nMost Women Want Laws Protecting Access to Abortion for Pregnancy-Related Emergencies and in the Case of Rape or Incest\n\nViews on whether abortion should be legal are largely divided along party lines with large majorities of Democratic women (91%) and independent women (81%) saying abortion should be legal, compared to half of Republican women who say abortions should be either illegal in all or most cases. In addition, most Republican women voters support a national ban on abortions after 15 weeks, and most Democratic women support a law guaranteeing a national right to abortion. However, there is some agreement on access to abortion in some instances. For example, there is consistent support, across partisans, for laws protecting access to abortions for patients who are experiencing pregnancy-related emergencies and in the case of rape or incest.\n\nThis is true even in states where abortion is currently banned or limited. At least three-fourths of women (79%) living in states where abortion is currently restricted say they support a federal law protecting access to abortion in cases of rape or incest, including 88% of Democratic women and 66% of Republican women living in these states. In addition, 90% of Democratic women and 76% of Republican women living in states where abortion is banned or limited want laws protecting access to abortions for patients who are experiencing pregnancy-related emergencies.\n\nKey Takeaways From Michigan and Arizona\n\nThe KFF Survey of Women Voters also includes separate surveys of women voters in Arizona and Michigan, two states that President Biden won in 2020 with very close margins (less than 3 percentage points in Michigan and less than 1 percentage point in Arizona) and are seen as key battleground states in the 2024 election. Yet, no battleground state is alike, and the KFF Survey of Women Voters demonstrates that each of these states pose very distinct races for the presidential candidates as well as elections for the U.S. Senate.\n\nMajority of Arizona Women Voters Say They Plan on Supporting the Arizona Right to Abortion Initiative, See It as a Motivating Force to Turnout\n\nAbortion is weighing heavily on the minds of Arizona women voters. Voters in Arizona may be voting on the Arizona Right to Abortion Initiative this November, a proposed state constitutional amendment which would establish a fundamental right to abortion until fetal viability, typically around 23 to 25 weeks of pregnancy. Under current Arizona law, abortions are legal until 15 weeks, though abortion laws have been in flux since the state Supreme Court first ruled in April that an 1864 law criminalizing all abortions was enforceable. Since then, the state legislature repealed the law, but it may go into effect for some period of time before the November election.\n\nTwo-thirds (67%) of women voters in Arizona say they support the Arizona Right to Abortion Initiative which may appear on the ballot this fall. The ballot measure has strong support among independent women (68%) and Democratic women voters (91%), while most Republican women (61%) say they oppose the initiative.\n\nOverall, half of women voters in Arizona say they would be more motivated to vote if the abortion initiative made it on the ballot, including large groups of voters who support the ballot initiative such as Democratic women voters (60%), and women of reproductive age (58%), including three-fourths (74%) of the youngest women voters ages 18-29. This is especially important given that one in four women voters ages 18 to 29 in Arizona say they don\u2019t plan on voting in the 2024 presidential election or plan on voting for a third-party candidate.\n\nYet, a majority of women voters in Arizona, including those who say the ballot measure would motivate them to turn out, say there is a possibility they could vote for a candidate who doesn\u2019t share their view on abortion. In fact, most say a candidate\u2019s position on abortion is just one of many important factors in their vote choice including 54% of Democratic women, 66% of independent women, and 64% of Republican women. And abortion ranks alongside a series of other issues and behind inflation and immigration as top voting issues for the 2024 presidential race among women voters in Arizona. Check out the dashboard to see where abortion ranks as a voting issue among groups of Arizona women voters.\n\nMany Michigan Women See Abortion as a Settled Issue in Their State\n\nAbortion is no longer front of mind for Michigan women, who turned out in record numbers in the 2022 midterm elections to enshrine the right to an abortion into the state constitution. The majority of Michigan women voters, including 69% of Democratic women say the issue of whether abortion is legal is \u201cdecided\u201d in their state.\n\nInflation is Top Issue for Michigan Women\n\nFor Michigan women, inflation ranks as the most important issue for both Black women and White women in the state. It ranks among the top issues across partisans. Check out the dashboard to see the top issues for Michigan women voters. And while Democratic women voters in Michigan largely approve of the way President Biden has handled abortion and reproductive health, they are much more critical of his handling of inflation and the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. In fact, a statewide campaign to protest President Biden providing military aid to Israel and to demand a permanent ceasefire in Gaza led to a historic number of \u201cuncommitted\u201d votes (13%) in the 2024 Democratic primary election in the state.\n\nBlack women are going to be a necessary component of Biden\u2019s strategy if he plans on winning Michigan\u2019s electoral votes. Currently, President Biden isn\u2019t generating the same level of support among Black women in Michigan that he did in 2020 with about one in five Black women (18%) now saying they plan on voting for former President Trump. Black women in Michigan are about three times as likely as White women to say the political party of candidates makes the biggest difference in how they vote for president, indicating that despite lower support for President Biden, they may vote for him because he is the Democratic Party candidate.\n\nYet, the cost of household expenses is causing worries for a majority of Black women in Michigan with at least six in ten saying the worry about affording the cost of health care (64%), their rent or mortgage (69%), their monthly utilities (70%), and food and groceries (75%). While a slight majority of Black women voters in Michigan say the Democratic Party does a better job than the Republican Party of addressing the cost of household expenses, three in ten say neither party does a better job of this. In addition, four in ten Black Democratic women say they disapprove of President Biden\u2019s handling of inflation, perhaps why some Black women voters in the state may no longer support the Democratic presidential candidate. Check out the dashboard to see more about the views of Black women in Michigan.",

        "text": "US Presidential elections 2024: Donald Trump calls Vivek Ramaswamy \u2018smart guy\u2019, hints to keep in his team\nUS Presidential Elections 2024: Former US President and Republican candidate Donald Trump lauded Indian-origin entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, at a rally in Wisconsin. Trump described Ramaswamy as \u201csmart\u201d and hinted that he would be involved in his team in some capacity.\n\nTrump expressed confidence in Vivek Ramaswamy's abilities, stating, \u201cIf I gave it to Vivek to do, he\u2019d pull it off,\u201d referring to his administration's tariff deals with French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nThe Republican Party's national convention, scheduled for July 15 to 18, will be held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nIt is anticipated that during this gathering, former US President Donald Trump will be officially nominated as the party's candidate for the upcoming general election on November 5.\n\nTrump further mentioned, \u201cHe\u2019s going to be with us in some form,\u201d indicating Ramaswamy's future involvement. Trump also praised Ramaswamy as a \"smart guy\" during his rally speech.\n\nAt the Wisconsin rally, Ramaswamy was introduced as \u201cThe Fake Vivek,\u201d a label akin to Trump's characteristic insults, which was also mentioned in a leaked memo directing then-presidential candidate Ron DeSantis to use this name.\n\nDuring the event, Ramaswamy drew comparisons between Trump and the signers of the Declaration of Independence, particularly likening him to George Washington, referring to Trump as \u201cthe George Washington of our era.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Ramaswamy told the New York Post that amidst media speculation, Vivek's primary commitment is ensuring President Trump's reelection to advance the \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda.\n\nThe spokesperson expressed confidence in Ramaswamy's potential role in future administrations, emphasizing his dedication to driving private sector change and economic reform.\n\nAdditionally, Ramaswamy remains focused on combating what he views as harmful trends like the ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) movement in corporate America.",

        "text": "Secretary Mayorkas Outlines National Priorities for Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience for Next Two Years\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Today, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas outlined strategic guidance to guide critical infrastructure security and resilience efforts by federal agencies, critical infrastructure owners and operators, and other government and private sector stakeholders. This guidance builds on President Biden\u2019s National Security Memorandum (NSM-22) on Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience and sets forth specific risk areas that should be prioritized in a whole-of-society effort for the next two years to secure the critical infrastructure systems Americans rely on every day.\n\n\n\nThe priority areas are:\n\nAddressing cyber and other threats posed by the People\u2019s Republic of China;\n\nManaging evolving risks and opportunities presented by artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies;\n\nIdentifying and mitigating supply chain vulnerabilities;\n\nIncorporating climate risks into sector resilience efforts; and\n\nAddressing the growing dependency of critical infrastructure on space systems and assets.\n\nThe guidance issued by DHS reflects a key step in the whole-of-society effort directed by the President to protect the critical infrastructure systems on which Americans rely every day.\n\n\n\n\u201cFrom the banking system to the electric grid, from healthcare to our nation\u2019s water systems and more, we depend on the reliable functioning of our critical infrastructure as a matter of national security, economic security, and public safety,\" said Secretary Mayorkas. \u201cThe threats facing our critical infrastructure demand a whole of society response and the priorities set forth in this memo will guide that work. I look forward to continuing our work with partners at all levels of government and the private sector to better ensure the safety of all Americans.\"\n\n\n\nThe Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), as the national coordinator of critical infrastructure security and resilience efforts, will drive sector-specific risk assessments and management plans by (or for) Sector Risk Management Agencies (SRMAs) and other important partners that address the outlined priority risk areas and adopt the identified risk mitigation activities, culminating in the National Infrastructure Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\n\u201cThrough close collaboration with our partners, CISA and the Department are working towards safer and more secure critical infrastructure to ensure the functioning of government, the delivery of essential services, and the protection of the American people,\u201d said CISA Director Jen Easterly.\n\n\n\nThe 2024 Homeland Security Threat Assessment states that domestic and foreign adversaries will likely continue to target our critical infrastructure, in part because they perceive targeting these sectors would be detrimental to U.S. industries and the American way of life. From attacks aimed at disrupting services to espionage focused on gaining access to networks and stealing sensitive information, these actors are constantly adapting their techniques to gain access and potentially compromise these entities.\n\n\n\nCritical infrastructure systems provide essential goods and services to Americans like clean water, dependable electricity, food, communications, internet connectivity, and manufactured goods. By issuing today\u2019s guidance, the Department of Homeland Security is leading the national effort to identify and mitigate threats and make more resilient our critical infrastructure in this era of technological advancement and dynamic global volatility.\n\n\n\nRead the memo from Secretary Mayorkas on strategic guidance and national priorities for U.S. critical infrastructure security and resilience.",

        "text": "Robert F Kennedy Jr fails to meet requirements to take part in CNN debate\nRobert F Kennedy Jr, who is running as an independent presidential candidate, will not be included in CNN\u2019s debate next week after failing to meet the network\u2019s criteria.\n\nA Wednesday midnight deadline passed without Kennedy being able to demonstrate that he had met the conditions necessary to share the debate platform with Joe Biden and Donald Trump.\n\nCNN has stipulated that participants need to have secured ballot access in enough states to capture the 270 electoral college votes necessary to win the presidency, while recording 15% support in at least four national polls.\n\nKennedy, an environmental lawyer who has gained a reputation for engaging in anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, has been confirmed on the ballot in only five states \u2013 Utah, Delaware, Oklahoma, Michigan and Tennessee \u2013 according to the Washington Post.\n\nAdditionally, CNN credited him with being on the ballot in California and Hawaii, where he is the presumptive nominee for several smaller parties where the states have yet to certify him. In total, the states account for 100 electoral votes.\n\nAs of Wednesday, Kennedy had reached the 15% polling threshold in just three national surveys.\n\nKennedy\u2019s campaign has threatened to sue CNN if it does not include him in the 27 June debate. The campaign has claimed that he is on the ballot for nine states and has collected enough signatures to be given ballot access in 14 more.\n\nKennedy has also filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission arguing that his exclusion is unfair.\n\nAnalysts have speculated that his competing as a third-party candidate could have a potentially significant effect on the outcome of November\u2019s election, with polls showing Biden and Trump running neck-and-neck, both nationally and in several battleground states.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "The National Task Force on Election Crises\nCandidate Succession Before Election Day\n\nIn the unfortunate event that a presidential candidate dies, becomes incapacitated, or resigns before Election Day, political parties have established procedures to replace that candidate and continue with the election. Our political system and election laws rely on political parties to determine a replacement. In the rare instances in U.S. history in which this has happened, political parties have worked effectively to do so.\n\n\n\nPolitical parties have control over the process of replacing their candidates.\n\nBefore Election Day, the political parties have principal control over how to handle a dead or incapacitated candidate, or one who steps down. No constitutional or statutory provisions cover this scenario and there is strong legal and historical precedent for party control. Indeed, before the era of modern presidential primaries, parties assumed total control of the nomination process and hand-picked the nominees without direct voter input.\n\nThe exact rules for the process of nominee succession hinge on the timing of when a candidate dies, steps down, or becomes incapacitated:\n\nBefore the conventions\n\nIf a presidential candidate dies, becomes incapacitated or steps down before the party conventions, the party delegates would select their nominee at the convention from among other candidates or new entrants.\n\nAfter the conventions\n\nIf a death or incapacity arises after the convention, the two major political parties each have rules for selecting a substitution:\n\nDemocrats: the members of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) would choose the new nominee by majority vote in a special session called by the chair. The DNC chair is required to consult with Democratic congressional leadership and the Democratic Governors Association, and then reports to DNC members who choose.\n\nThis process was used in 1972, for example, when the Democratic Vice Presidential nominee Thomas Eagleton withdrew his nomination and the DNC members voted to replace him on the ticket with Sargent Shriver.\n\nRepublicans: the Republican National Committee has the power to fill vacancies resulting from \u201cdeath, declination, or otherwise.\u201d Members would vote as part of their state delegation under the same vote distribution used for the convention itself, and delegation members could divide their votes if they did not agree. Alternatively, the Republicans could reconvene the national convention.\n\nElection Laws Control How Ballots are Changed and Counted\n\nGeneral election ballots are generally not printed before early fall and changes can typically be made to the ballots before that time. As it gets closer to Election Day, there would be increasing issues about whether ballots can or should be reprinted and other logistical adjustments can be made. Several administrative processes in the lead-up to elections make last-minute changes difficult. For example, election administrators must conduct pre-election programming and testing before ballots are printed. In addition, at least some ballots must be printed well in advance of Election Day to accommodate military and overseas voting as well as absentee or mail-in voting as permitted in the jurisdiction. A combination of federal and state law governs such processes and as such is not uniform across jurisdictions. This lack of uniformity could contribute to confusion.\n\nDespite the tumult the death, resignation or incapacitation of a presidential candidate would surely cause, one protection built into the system is that in a presidential election voters cast their ballots not for a candidate but for a slate of electors pledged to a candidate. In some cases, the names of the state Electoral College electors appear on the ballot. Even where a replaced presidential or vice presidential candidate\u2019s name might remain on the ballot, votes for that candidate\u2019s electors would still count and those electors \u2013 who are chosen by the parties, usually on the basis of strong loyalty \u2013 could transfer their votes to the party\u2019s replacement nominee (depending on state law).\n\nConclusion\n\nU.S. political parties put voters at the center of the U.S. presidential selection process. But political parties operate as an important safeguard to ensure a rules-based process should a presidential candidate who voters choose in the primary and convention process die, step down or otherwise become incapacitated. It is well within our political norms and the laws of our election processes for a political party to manage such an unfortunate event. Voters should feel confident that political parties and states have rules in place that anticipate such contingencies.",

        "text": "Deluge of \u2018pink slime\u2019 websites threaten to drown out truth with fake news in US election\nPolitical groups on the right and left are using fake news websites designed to look like reliable sources of information to fill the void left by the demise of local newspapers, raising fears of the impact that they might have during the United States\u2019 bitterly fought 2024 election.\n\nSome media experts are concerned that the so-called pink slime websites, often funded domestically, could prove at least as harmful to political discourse and voters\u2019 faith in media and democracy as foreign disinformation efforts in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections.\n\nAccording to a recent report from NewsGuard, a company that aims to counter misinformation by studying and rating news websites, the websites are so prolific that \u201cthe odds are now better than 50-50 that if you see a news website purporting to cover local news, it\u2019s fake.\u201d\n\nNewsGuard estimates that there are a staggering 1,265 such fake local news websites in the US \u2013 4% more than the websites of 1,213 daily newspapers left operating in the country.\n\n\u201cActors on both sides of the political spectrum\u201d feel \u201cthat what they are doing isn\u2019t bad because all media is really biased against their side or that that they know actors on the other side are using these tactics and so they feel they need to,\u201d said Matt Skibinski, general manager of NewsGuard, which determined that such sites now outnumber legitimate local news organizations. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely contributed to partisanship and the erosion of trust in media; it\u2019s also a symptom of those things.\u201d\n\nPink slime websites, named after a meat byproduct, started at least as early as 2004 when Brian Timpone, a former television reporter who described himself as a \u201cbiased guy\u201d and a Republican, started funding websites featuring names of cities, towns and regions like the Philly Leader and the South Alabama Times.\n\nTimpone\u2019s company, Metric Media, now operates more than 1,000 such websites and his private equity company receives funding from conservative political action committees, according to NewsGuard.\n\nThe Leader recently ran a story with the headline, \u201cRep Evans votes to count illegal aliens towards seats in Congress.\u201d\n\nIn actuality, Representative Dwight Evans, a Democrat, did not vote to start counting undocumented immigrants in the 2030 census but rather against legislation that would have changed the way the country has conducted apportionment since 1790.\n\nThat sort of story is \u201cstandard practice for these outlets\u201d, according to Tim Franklin, who leads Northwestern University\u2019s Local News Initiative, which researches the industry.\n\n\u201cThey will take something that maybe has just a morsel of truth to it and then twist it with their own partisan or ideological spin,\u201d Franklin said. \u201cThey also tend to do it on issues like immigration or hot-button topics that they think will elicit an emotional response.\u201d\n\nA story published this month on the NW Arkansas News site had a headline on the front page that reported that the unemployment rate in 2021 in Madison county was 5.1% \u2013 even though there is much more recent data available. In April 2024, the local unemployment rate was 2.5%.\n\n\u201cAnother tactic that we have seen across many of this category of sites is taking a news story that happened at some point and presenting it as if it just happened now, in a way that is misleading,\u201d Skibinski said.\n\nThe left has also created websites designed to look like legitimate news organizations but actually shaped by Democratic supporters.\n\nThe liberal Courier Newsroom network operates websites in Arizona, Florida, Iowa, Michigan and Nevada, among other states, that \u2013 like the conservative pink slime sites \u2013 have innocuous sounding names like the Copper Courier and Up North News. The Courier has runs stories like \u201cGov Ducey Is Now the Most Unpopular Governor in America,\u201d referring to Doug Ducy, the former Republican Arizona governor.\n\n\u201cIn contrast, coverage of Democrats, including US President Joe Biden, Democratic Arizona Gov Katie Hobbs, and US Sen Mark Kelly of Arizona, is nearly always laudatory,\u201d NewsGuard stated in a report about Courier coverage.\n\nTara McGowan, a Democratic strategist who founded the Courier Newsroom has received funding from liberal donors like Reid Hoffman and George Soros, as well as groups associated with political action committees, according to NewsGuard.\n\n\u201cThere are pink slime operations on both the right and the left. To me, the key is disclosure and transparency about ownership,\u201d said Franklin.\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the Courier said comparisons between its operations and rightwing pink slime groups were unfair and criticized NewsGuard\u2019s methodology in comparing the two.\n\n\u201cCourier publishes award-winning, factual local news by talented journalists who live in the communities we cover, and our reporting is often cited by legacy media outlets. This is in stark contrast to the pink slime networks that pretend to have a local presence but crank out low-quality fake news with no bylines and no accountability. Courier is proudly transparent about our pro-democracy values, and we carry on the respected American tradition of advocacy journalism,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nWhile both the left and the right have invested in the pink slime websites, there are differences in the owners\u2019 approaches, according to Skibinski.\n\nThe right-wing networks have created more sites \u201cthat are probably getting less attention per site, and on the left, there is a smaller number of sites, but they are more strategic about getting attention to those sites on Facebook and elsewhere\u201d, Skibinski said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that we can quantify whether one is more impactful than the other.\u201d\n\nArtificial intelligence could also help site operators quickly generate stories and create fake images.\n\n\u201cThe technology underlying artificial intelligence is now becoming more accessible to malign actors,\u201d said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a University of Pennsylvania communications professor and director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center, which publishes Factcheck.org. \u201cThe capacity to create false images is very high, but also there is a capacity to detect the images that is emerging very rapidly. The question is, will it emerge rapidly with enough capacity?\u201d\n\nStill, it\u2019s not clear whether these websites are effective. Stanford University reported in a 2023 study that engagement with pink slime websites was \u201crelatively low\u201d and little evidence that living \u201cin a news desert made people more likely to consume pink slime\u201d.\n\nThe Philly Leader and the NW Arkansas News both only have links to Facebook accounts on their websites and have less than 450 followers on each. Meanwhile, the Copper Courier and Up North News have accounts on all the major platforms and a total of about 150,000 followers on Facebook.\n\nFranklin said he thinks that a lot of people don\u2019t actually click links on social media posts to visit the website.\n\n\u201cThe goal of some of these operators is not to get traffic directly to their site, but it\u2019s to go viral on social media,\u201d he said.\n\nRepublican lawmakers and leaders of the conservative news sites the Daily Wire and the Federalist have also filed a lawsuit and launched investigations accusing NewsGuard of helping the federal government censor right-leaning media. The defense department hired the company strictly to counter \u201cdisinformation efforts by Russian, Chinese and Iranian government-linked operations targeting Americans and our allies\u201d, Gordon Crovitz, the former Wall Street Journal publisher who co-founded NewsGuard, told the Hill in response to a House oversight committee investigation. \u201cWe look forward to clarifying the misunderstanding by the committee about our work for the Defense Department.\u201d\n\nTo counter the flood of misinformation, social media companies must take a more active role in monitoring such content, according to Franklin and Skibinski.\n\n\u201cThe biggest solution to this kind of site would be for the social media platforms to take more responsibility in terms of showing context to the user about sources that could be their own context. It could be data from third parties, like what we do,\u201d said Skibinski.\n\nFranklin would like to see a national media literacy campaign. States around the country have passed laws requiring such education in schools.\n\nFranklin also hopes that legitimate local news could rebound. The MacArthur Foundation and other donors last year pledged $500m to help local outlets.\n\n\u201cI actually have more optimism now than I had a few years ago,\u201d Franklin said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the midst of historic changes in how people consume news and how it\u2019s produced and how it\u2019s distributed and how it\u2019s paid for, but I think there\u2019s still demand for local news, and that\u2019s kind of where it all starts.\u201d",

Kennedy has failed to qualify for the presidential debate with President Biden and former President Donald Trump. The debate will be hosted by CNN next week in Atlanta, on June 27. Kennedy had until 12:00:01 a.m. ET Thursday to fulfill the debate requirements.\n\nUnder CNN's criteria, a candidate must appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to be eligible to win 270 electoral votes, the number needed to win the presidency. Kennedy is on the ballot in five states \u2014 Utah, Michigan, Delaware, Oklahoma and Tennessee \u2014 for a total of 42 electoral votes. He'll also be on the ballot in California as the nominee of the American Independent Party, and in Hawaii, on his We the People ticket, which adds up to 100 potential electoral votes.\n\nThough Kennedy has submitted petitions for ballot access in a number of states, several of his applications are still being reviewed by the state election offices.\n\nCandidates were also required to reach a polling threshold of 15% in four major national polls by June 20. According to CNN, Kennedy fell short, with three qualifying national polls.\n\n\"Presidents Biden and Trump do not want me on the debate stage and CNN illegally agreed to their demand,\" Kennedy said in a statement. \"My exclusion by Presidents Biden and Trump from the debate is undemocratic, un-American, and cowardly.\"\n\nIn May, Kennedy's campaign filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission accusing CNN, Mr. Biden, Trump and their campaigns of violating federal election law.\n\nThe Kennedy campaign claims CNN approached the debate criteria differently for Kennedy than for Trump and Mr. Biden, the presumptive nominees of their respective parties. The debate will take place before either the Democratic Party or the Republican Party hold their conventions to formalize their nominees. The Kennedy campaign is alleging the debate is an illegal campaign contribution to both Mr. Biden and Trump\n\n\"By demanding our campaign meet different criteria to participate in the debate than Presidents Biden and Trump, CNN's debate violates FEC law and is a large prohibited corporate contribution to both the Biden and Trump campaigns,\" Kennedy said.\n\nKennedy says that he cannot file a lawsuit until the FCC complaint is dismissed. His campaign says that the FEC stated there might be merit in his complaint and won't dismiss it, but it has not yet reached a decision. The FEC declined to comment.",

And yet Americans are generally not aware of the trend, he says.\n\n\u201cNational Gun Violence Awareness Month [currently ongoing] is an appropriate time for the public to become aware of the improvement,\u201d says Fox, who has been studying murder for four decades. \u201cBut the word isn\u2019t getting out.\u201d\n\nHomicides throughout the U.S. decreased by 26.4% overall in the first quarter of 2024, according to the FBI data, which was released on June 10. Violent crimes overall \u2014 including rapes, aggravated assaults and robberies \u2014 dropped by more than 15% in that span.\n\nFox says the murder rate in Boston is lower than most major U.S. cities for several reasons, including:\n\nMassachusetts\u2019 gun-ownership rate of 14%, which is the lowest in the U.S. and is complemented by some of the nation\u2019s strongest gun laws.\n\nA relatively cool climate. (Fox\u2019s research shows that crime tends to spike in hot weather.)\n\nA high number of emergency rooms and trauma centers in the city.\n\nJames Alan Fox has been studying murder for four decades. Photo by Matthew Modoono/Northeastern University\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also true that Massachusetts has the highest percentage of well-educated people in the country,\u201d adds Fox, the Lipman Family Professor of Criminology, Law and Public Policy at Northeastern. \u201cEducated people have been found to be less likely to commit homicide.\u201dJacob Stowell, a Northeastern associate professor of criminology and criminal justice, also credits Boston Mayor Michelle Wu for emphasizing crime reduction.\n\n\u201cThere has been a lot more community involvement \u2014 a lot more stakeholders and folks at the table who should have been at the table for a long time,\u201d Stowell says. \u201cWhen you see big reductions like this, it\u2019s the result of a confluence of factors, any one of which would be beneficial, which are operating in concert.\u201d\n\nThose factors are emerging in neighboring cities, Stowell adds.\n\n\u201cNationally, the Northeast is outpacing all of the other regions in the reduction,\u201d Stowell says. \u201cSo there is definitely something involved here that\u2019s not just Boston-related but may be Northeast-driven.\u201d",

        "text": "Trump proposes green cards for foreign grads of US colleges, departing from anti-immigrant rhetoric\nMIAMI (AP) \u2014 Former President Donald Trump said in an interview posted Thursday he wants to give automatic green cards to foreign students who graduate from U.S. colleges, a sharp departure from the anti-immigrant rhetoric he typically uses on the campaign trail.\n\nTrump was asked about plans for companies to be able to import the \u201cbest and brightest\u201d in a podcast taped Wednesday with venture capitalists and tech investors called the \u201cAll-In.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I want to do and what I will do is you graduate from a college, I think you should get automatically as part of your diploma a green card to be able to stay in this country. And that includes junior colleges too, anybody graduates from a college. You go there for two years or four years,\u201d he said, vowing to address this concern on day one.\n\nImmigration has been Trump\u2019s signature issue during his 2024 bid to return to the White House. His suggestion that he would offer green cards \u2014 documents that confer a pathway to U.S. citizenship \u2014 to potentially hundreds of thousands of foreign graduates would represent a sweeping expansion of America\u2019s immigration system that sharply diverges from his most common messages on foreigners.\n\nTrump often says during his rallies that immigrants who are in the country illegally endanger public safety, and steal jobs and government resources, and once suggested that they are \u201cpoisoning the blood of our country.\u201d He has promised to carry out the largest deportation operation in U.S. history if elected.\n\nTrump and his allies often say they distinguish between people entering illegally versus legally. But during his administration, Trump also proposed curbs on legal immigration such as family-based visas and the visa lottery program.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nRight after taking office in 2017, he issued his \u201cBuy American and Hire American\u201d executive order, directing Cabinet members to suggest reforms to ensure that business visas were only awarded to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants to protect American workers.\n\nHe has previously said the H1-B program commonly used by companies to hire foreign workers temporarily \u2014 a program he has used in the past \u2014 was \u201cvery bad\u201d and used by tech companies to get foreign workers for lower pay.\n\nDuring the conversation with \u201cAll-In,\u201d Trump blamed the coronavirus pandemic for being unable to implement these measures while he was president. He said he knows of stories of people who graduate from top colleges and want to stay in the U.S. but can\u2019t secure visas to do so, forcing them to return to their native countries, specifically naming India and China. He said they go on and become multibillionaires, employing thousands of workers.\n\n\u201cYou need a pool of people to work for your company,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd they have to be smart people. Not everybody can be less than smart. You need brilliant people.\u201d\n\nIn a statement released hours after the podcast was posted, campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: \u201cPresident Trump has outlined the most aggressive vetting process in U.S. history, to exclude all communists, radical Islamists, Hamas supporters, America haters and public charges. He believes, only after such vetting has taken place, we ought to keep the most skilled graduates who can make significant contributions to America. This would only apply to the most thoroughly vetted college graduates who would never undercut American wages or workers.\u201d",

        "text": "Tulsi Gabbard has shed her old Democratic policy stances. Is it a push to serve with Donald Trump?\nKAILUA, Hawaii \u2212 Tulsi Gabbard has made a significant shift in her political path since leaving the Democratic Party in 2022 and registering as an Independent. The former presidential candidate and four-term congresswoman's career once was defined by championing progressive policies such as gun control, climate action and abortion rights.\n\nNow, the 43-year-old is actively tossing her name into the mix to serve in a future Republican administration, possibly even as a long-shot pick to be Donald Trump's vice-presidential running mate.\n\nGabbard's pivot began with her sharp criticisms of Democrats. She has since echoed pro-Russia conspiracy theories, expressed skepticism about abortion access and questioned the value of spending money on climate change initiatives. These changes signal her departure from the progressive platform that initially brought her to national prominence.\n\nHer new positions may attract some conservative voters, but they also risk alienating MAGA supporters who question her ideological consistency. As a former 2020 Democratic primary rival of now-Vice President Kamala Harris, Gabbard's transformed stances could expose her to attacks from Democrats who view her as a political opportunist.\n\nScott Walker, the former Wisconsin governor and a 2016 Trump primary rival, wrote last week in the Washington Times that he welcomed Gabbard's recent political transformation and sharp critiques of the Biden administration. He said it \"might be worth\" Trump tapping Gabbard for a Cabinet job \"where her views match those of the president,\" noting she's publicly expressed an interest to be secretary of defense or secretary of state.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nBut Walker also added, \"I do not want someone with such a liberal voting record a heartbeat away from the Oval Office.\"\n\nHere's a rundown on some of Gabbard's shifting policy positions:\n\nMore:Tulsi Gabbard could be Trump's unusual pick for VP\n\nAbortion\n\nDuring her early years in Congress, Gabbard maintained a 100% voting record with both Planned Parenthood and NARAL, and ahe supported regulating abortions during the third trimester of pregnancy.\n\n\u201cThe very real possibility of Roe v. Wade being overturned terrifies me. I am sick of women's bodies being used as pawns so politicians can score cheap political points at the expense of their freedom and safety.\u201d Gabbard said on a questionnaire prior to the 2020 presidential election.\n\nBut years later, in a statement regarding her public decision to leave the Democratic Party, Gabbard criticized the Biden administration's October 2022 arrest and indictment of several anti-abortion activists who had allegedly blocked access to a clinic.\n\nShe also criticized Harris and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., for their statements on the \"illegitimacy of the Supreme Court,\" following the justices' 6-3 decision in 2022 in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the case that overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\nGuns\n\nDuring her time in Congress and throughout her 2020 presidential campaign, Gabbard supported a ban on common rifle weapons and advocated for universal background checks. She received an F rating from the NRA, a 0% rating from the Hawaii Rifle Association, and a 100% rating from the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.\n\n\"Last week\u2019s tragic shooting at Saugus High School is a chilling reminder that we must do more to prevent gun violence at our schools,\" Gabbard said in 2019, citing a bill she had introduced that would require the federal government to publish an annual report with new data on school shootings. \"To do that, we need to have a common understanding of the problem.\"\n\nSince retiring from Congress in 2021, Gabbard's positions on gun control and gun owners' rights have undergone major changes. Gabbard notably supported the Supreme Court's ruling in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen, affirming the Second Amendment right to carry a handgun for self-defense outside the home.\n\nIn a podcast posted to her YouTube channel last month, Gabbard acknowledged that she no longer supported restrictive gun control measures, such as an assault weapons ban.\n\n\u201cMy views on, you know, things like the assault weapons ban have changed out of that learning, understanding, and that growth in really appreciating our founders' full intent for the Second Amendment,\u201d Gabbard said.\n\nMore:Tulsi Gabbard could be Trump's unusual pick for VP\n\nMore:'He doesn\u2019t want another Mike Pence': Kamala Harris hits Donald Trump's potential vice presidential picks\n\nClimate Change\n\nAddressing climate change had long been a central focus of Gabbard's efforts. Her commitment was evident during her congressional campaigns in 2012 and 2014, when she secured endorsements from the Sierra Club Hawaii Chapter.\n\nIn September 2017, she introduced a legislation aiming to transition the United States to 100% renewable energy by 2035. The bill also called for stringent vehicle emission standards and a ban on the hydraulic fracturing technique used to extract oil and natural gas from deep underground.\n\nMore recently, Gabbard has been critical of Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, a law signed in 2022 that included significant new federal funding to combat climate change. In an interview with the PBD Podcast, she said she believes that the movement to address climate change has actually failed to consider \"all of the essential elements for our survival.\"\n\nMore:As Donald Trump's VP choice is awaited with bated breath, what ever happened to Pence?\n\nForeign Policy\n\nGabbard's foreign policy positions have consistently reflected her strong anti-interventionist stance, shaped by her experiences as a combat veteran. She served in the Hawaii Army National Guard and was deployed to Iraq in 2004 and Kuwait in 2008. She's also been an outspoken critic of what she has dubbed \"regime change wars\" and has advocated for withdrawing U.S. troops from conflict zones like Syria and Afghanistan.\n\nWhile Trump was president, Gabbard sharply criticized his support for Saudi Arabia following the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. In 2018, she referred to Trump as \"Saudi Arabia's bitch\" in response to his decision to stand by the country's rulers despite Khashoggi's murder.\n\nHer stance toward Trump's foreign policy has become more favorable recently. In February, the Washington Post reported that Trump and his top advisers have been consulting with Gabbard on America's role on the world stage and the potential future direction of the Defense Department should the Republican win a second term. This marks a significant shift from her previous criticisms, reflecting a new alignment with some of Trump's own views.\n\nGabbard has also been vocal about her opposition to U.S. involvement in Ukraine. She has recently advocated against American military support in the region and has been criticized for spreading pro-Russia conspiracy theories. For instance, she has repeatedly claimed that the United States provoked Russia into invading Ukraine by pursuing NATO expansion and has suggested that the U.S. has been supporting neo-Nazis in Ukraine.\n\nJeremy Yurow is a politics reporting fellow based in Hawaii for the USA TODAY Network.

        "text": "The anatomy of a resurging rumor stemming from peer-reviewed research that non-citizens vote in U.S. elections\nBy Mert Can Bayar, Ashlyn B. Aske, Danielle Lee Tomson, Kate Starbird, and Jevin West\n\nCenter for an Informed Public\n\nUniversity of Washington\n\nThis is part of an ongoing series of rapid research blog posts and rapid research analysis about the 2024 U.S. elections from the University of Washington\u2019s Center for an Informed Public.\n\nA 2016 election rumor using peer-reviewed research has resurged, this time claiming that 10 to 27% of non-citizens vote in U.S. elections. The research had previously been instrumentalized by then-candidate Donald Trump but had been highly criticized by the academic community both before and after Trump cited it.\n\nThis blog post reviews the history of the rumor and the anatomy of its spread. It does not offer new data analysis about the peer-reviewed research itself. Instead, it details the history of the claim, records several critical points of the scholarly discussion in the last decade, and tracks the social media spread of this particular claim.\n\nThis blog post was written to assist journalists, fact-checkers, and the broader publi c in tracing the rumor\u2019s origins and contextualizing its place in current debates about the 2024 U.S. election.\n\nThis rumor and tactic of using peer-reviewed research in misleading ways will likely re-emerge in the 2024 election or future election cycles. Our purpose here is to provide a comprehensive review of the rumor and highlight its broader implications for using peer-reviewed research and scientific methods to endorse and validate false rumors about integrity in the U.S. elections.\n\nOn May 13, a website called Just Facts published an article that renewed attention to an old claim that non-citizens were illegally voting in U.S. elections. This rumor originates from a 2014 peer-reviewed paper and initially spread in 2016 when President-elect Trump voiced it both before and after the U.S. election. It has resurfaced again in 2024, amassing 26 million views on X over two days. [1] Though the spread of the rumor on social media has since waned, the underlying claim is important to study because it leverages peer-reviewed scientific research in misleading ways, which can contribute to diminishing trust in academic knowledge and institutions as well as elections. We expect to see this rumor and this tactic of leveraging science and statistics in misleading ways to be repeated this election cycle.\n\nClaims about non-citizen voting are common in election rumoring. Significant portions of the U.S. public already believe in similar false rumors and conspiracy theories about non-citizens\u2019 involvement in U.S. elections. In the past decade, the Just Facts website has posted multiple articles endorsing false claims of election fraud and non-citizen voting. In their recent article, they claim that 10% to 27% of non-citizens, including documented and undocumented immigrants, vote in U.S. elections. This claim extends the findings of a 2014 paper, which was met with heavy criticism from the academic community. In said paper, political scientist Jesse Richman and his co-authors analyzed 2008 and 2010 CES survey data, an established dataset in political science that samples a representative group of American adults for social scientific research. According to their analysis, Richman and his co-authors concluded that 6.4% of noncitizens voted in the 2008 elections, and 2.2% voted in the 2010 elections. They suggested that these numbers could have had a significant impact on the results of the 2008 presidential elections and key U.S. House and Senate races. However, this study was widely refuted in public and academic discussions, critiquing the sample size, data, and methods, among other points.\n\nIn this rapid research post, our team at the University of Washington\u2019s Center for an Informed Public explains the history of this claim, the scholarly discussion surrounding the rumor in the last decade, and the spread of the rumor on several social media platforms in mid-May 2024 following the publication of the Just Facts article.\n\nSignificance of This Tactic\n\nThis rumor is worth our attention due to its validation from a highly contested peer-reviewed study, which was deployed to add credibility to the false claims of the scale of non-citizen voting. This credibility or epistemic authority, combined with the misuse of scientific methods and data, is a typical pattern in the spread of misinformation about science, public health, and elections. Political elites may inappropriately use scientific articles to evidence narratives in their interest, even if authors did not intend their work to be used as such.\n\nOnline influencers, newsbrokers, and elites can use such articles to validate their claims and fit them into their narratives. If the scientific article is discredited or contested in the scientific community, other influencer or newsbroker communities can use the same case to discredit the scientific peer-review process and feed larger mistrust in the scientific method and established institutions of scientific inquiry (e.g., peer-review process, scientific journals, researchers or research institutions).\n\nThe Present and Past Controversy Around the Peer-Reviewed Article\n\nThe Just Facts article was written by James Agresti, who identifies as an independent researcher. In the article, Agresti claims to have conducted a new and improved data analysis of the non-citizen voting phenomenon and claims that 10 to 27 percent of non-citizens \u2014 again, undocumented immigrants and documented immigrants without citizenship \u2014 vote in the U.S. elections. According to fact-checkers and academic researchers, this claim is false. Agresti\u2019s study is based on Richman\u2019s findings, which are flawed and unreliable.\n\nOn May 26, Alex Kasprak from Snopes published a fact check on Agresti\u2019s recent findings and Richman\u2019s 2014 article. Snopes\u2019 fact check includes email interviews with the author of the Just Facts article, James Agresti; the leading author of the 2014 article, Jesse Richman; and Brian Shaffner, who was one of the primary investigators of CES data that have been used in the 2014 article and also one of the authors of a 2015 article that addressed the claims made by Richman and his colleagues. This is not Agresti\u2019s first claim about non-citizen voting. He made a similar claim regarding the 2016 elections. Alex Kasprak did a similar fact-check on the issue in 2017.\n\nThe 2014 article that started this rumor, \u201cDo non-citizens vote in U.S. elections?,\u201d was written by three political scientists, Jesse Richman, Gulshan Chatta, and David Earnest, and published in Electoral Studies, a well-known peer-reviewed journal in quantitative political science. The article used an established dataset, CCES (now known as CES). The authors estimated that 6.4 percent of non-citizens voted in the 2008 elections and 2.2 percent voted in the 2010 elections. These percentage estimates are based on a total of 29 survey respondents: 21 respondents (6.4%) in 2008 indicated they were non-citizens and reported voting, while 328 indicated they were non-citizens; 8 respondents (2.2%) in 2010 indicated they were non-citizens and reported voting, while 363 indicated they were non-citizens. The respondents were sampled from a larger population from the CES survey of more than 30,000 people. The authors claimed that these percentages were enough to change the outcomes of the 2008 elections, including Electoral College votes for the presidency and the composition of Congress.\n\nThe political science community has heavily disputed and discredited the 2014 article and its findings\u2013well before the findings were politicized and amplified in claims made by then-candidate Donald Trump. In fact, the scholars who ran the 2008 and 2010 CCES surveys \u2014 the dataset Richman and colleagues used to write the 2014 article \u2014 disputed the article\u2019s findings. They published a short response article in 2015 stating that measurement error (people who accidentally reported that they are non-citizens although they are citizens) in the 2008 and 2010 CCES surveys explain the findings of non-citizen voting. They state that the percentage of non-citizen votes in the U.S. elections is likely zero.\n\nThe claim that non-citizens vote in high numbers in U.S. elections got traction when Donald Trump voiced it after he lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential elections. Trump attributed this loss to \u201cillegal votes\u201d and referred to the 2014 article as evidence for his claims. It is important to note that the leading author of the 2014 article, Jesse Richman, has been interviewed multiple times defending his research findings, even if he has refuted that his study supports Trump\u2019s claims of widespread non-citizen voting. In an interview with Wired, Richman defended their 2014 findings but stated, \u201cTrump and others have been misreading our research and exaggerating our results to make claims we don\u2019t think our research supports.\u201d\n\nHe further noted that the partisan nature of the discussion is similar to \u201ca two-front war.\u201d He stated that people on the left aim to discredit their study on often flimsy grounds, while people on the right want to pretend this study is much more than it is or says much more than it does. That said, Richman has been chosen as an expert witness in several lawsuits related to non-citizen voting. His latest estimates of non-citizen voter registration are between 0 and 1 percent, drastically lower than the estimates they presented in the 2014 paper.\n\nFollowing Trump\u2019s statements and growing attention to the 2014 paper in the media, in 2017, 200 political scientists signed a letter contesting the findings of the 2014 article. In this letter, they concluded that \u201cthe scholarly political science community has generally rejected the findings in the Richman et al. study, and we believe it should not be cited or used in any debate over fraudulent voting.\u201d [2] Yet the scientific community had critiqued this article long before Trump had deployed it to credential his claims.\n\nAcademics\u2019 Rebuttals of the Peer-Reviewed Article Before It Was Used in a Rumor\n\nThe 2014 article received public and scholarly attention right after it was accepted for publication, especially after the authors Richman and Earnest wrote a summary of their findings on The Washington Post\u2019s Monkey Cage blog on October 21, 2014. In this piece, titled \u201cCould non-citizens decide the November Election?\u201d Richman repeated their claims and noted the limitations of their work. The Washington Post wrote a note at the beginning of this article citing and linking to several other rebuttals of Richman and Earnest\u2019s piece as well as Richman and Earnest\u2019s response to the rebuttals.\n\nOne of these rebuttals came from Michael Tesler, a political scientist who wrote a response piece titled \u201cMethodological challenges affect study of non-citizens\u2019 voting\u201d for the Monkey Cage blog on October 28, 2014. The piece raised possible methodological concerns about the 2014 article and summarized its traction in conservative media.\n\nPolitical scientists James McCann and Michael Jones-Correa wrote a response piece titled \u201cAre non-citizens following American election laws?\u201d In this piece, they analyzed survey data asking about campaign donation behavior on Latino immigrants from the 2012 Latino Immigrant National Election Study (LINES), a nationally representative survey of immigrants from the Spanish-speaking countries of Latin America. While the dataset does not include questions on voting or registration, the authors looked at survey respondents\u2019 answers on campaign donations. They found that almost none of the non-citizens sampled in the dataset donated money to candidates in the 2012 elections, indicating that the non-citizens\u2019 engagement in election-related activities is likely zero.\n\nIn another rebuttal, John Ahlquist and Scott Gehlbach, also political scientists, titled \u201cWhat can we learn about the electoral behavior of non-citizens from a survey designed to learn about citizens?\u201d pointed out that the CCES survey question on voter registration asked, \u201care you registered to vote\u201d but did not specify in which country. They stated that might have confused some survey respondents (who may have been registered to vote in another country) and caused a few incorrect answers.\n\nOn November 2, 2014, Richman and Earnest responded to the critics on the same platform. In their response, titled \u201cDo non-citizens vote in U.S. elections? A reply to our critics,\u201d the co-authors defended their article and its findings on the extent to which non-citizens vote in the U.S. elections, which they estimated to be 6.4 percent in the 2008 elections and 2.2 percent in the 2010 elections. They responded to Tesler\u2019s criticism of measurement error (citizens who mistakenly chose the non-citizen box in the survey), stating that both in 2010 and 2012, 85 respondents chose the non-citizen box (twice), and 10 of these 85 declared voting. Even though Richman and Earnest accept that CES does not provide a representative sample of non-citizens, they argue that they conducted their analyses in an appropriate manner.\n\nOn the other hand, Richman\u2019s recent estimates of non-citizen voter registration (not actual voting) stand between 0 and 1 percent. These estimates are based on Richman\u2019s analysis as an expert witness in an Arizona investigation on non-citizen voter registration and the recent CES dataset, where he concluded that non-citizens did not decide the Arizona Presidential election. Glenn Kessler from The Washington Post requested these court documents be made public and reported on March 2024, almost two months before Agresti\u2019s article was published.\n\nThe Resurgence of the Rumor in 2024\n\nWe analyzed the re-emergence of this rumor on several social media platforms, including Twitter/X, TikTok, Gettr, YouTube, Truth Social, Facebook, Telegram, and Gab. However, the restrictions on researchers\u2019 data access on many of these platforms limit our abilities to conduct quantitative analyses on the dynamics of the spread and prevent us from mapping its engagement network. Therefore, please consider this analysis exploratory only, not a comprehensive analysis of the rumor.\n\nOverall, the false claim that \u201c10 to 27 percent of non-citizens vote in U.S. elections\u201d received a contained spread on Twitter/X, receiving attention from a few newsbroker accounts and a small number of elite replies that boosted its visibility on the platform. Its spread on other platforms as of the first week of June 2024 remains relatively low. The spread is largely contained between May 15 and May 17, 2024.\n\nOn X, what appears to be the account of the Just Facts website tweeted about Agresti\u2019s article on May 13, 2024. This tweet received little attention; its views remain just over 1400. The article and the rumor started receiving more attention when an account named @LeadingReport tweeted about it as \u201cbreaking\u201d news on May 15, 2024. Leading Report appears to follow a similar tweet-sharing structure to many \u201cnewsbroker\u201d accounts we follow, in general, sharing information with a breaking news framing. In particular, the style of Leading Reports\u2019 tweets reminds us of @spectatorindex, another account we covered in a previous blog post. [3]\n\nLeading Report\u2019s tweet significantly increased the visibility of the Just Facts article with its 1.8 million views. In the next two days, the false rumor received more attention, adding up to a total of 26 million views, with several tweets and replies from newsbrokers and elite accounts. The most viewed tweets were from @Not_the_Bee, with 24.4 million views, and @kylenabecker, with 466 thousand views.\n\nElon Musk interacted with both of these accounts\u2019 tweets, including a reply to Kyle Becker and a quoted tweet of Not The Bee\u2019s tweet. In both instances, Musk mentioned Community Notes to fact-check the accuracy of the claim. We have not seen any Community Notes on either of these tweets as of the publication of this blog post. Musk\u2019s reply to Kyle Becker has been viewed 93,000 times, while his quoted tweet of the Not the Bee has over 24 million views.\n\nWe suspect that the 24 million views of Musk\u2019s quote of the Not the Bee\u2019s tweet drive this rumor\u2019s high visibility. A quick glance at Not the Bee\u2019s tweets and their views reveals that its views are often lower than 100 thousand. For instance, a similar tweet posted on May 20 about immigration got 47 thousand views. Therefore, in our estimates of visibility, we do not add Musk\u2019s quoted tweet into our calculations since it is likely that 24 million views of Not the Bee\u2019s own tweet and 24 million views of Musk\u2019s quoted tweet share a highly overlapping viewership. Therefore, we conclude that the total viewership of this rumor on X is close to 26 million rather than 50 million.\n\nThe spread\u2019s anatomy: Evidence is produced by a peer-reviewed study, newsbrokers post it to resonate with existing narratives, and elite accounts boost its visibility.\n\nWe have seen a similar trend of spread in this false rumor about non-citizen voting that we saw and analyzed before. In this case, evidence (of non-citizen voting) is produced by a heavily disputed academic article and a new article that claims to replicate and extend its findings. Then, the newsbroker accounts such as @LeadingReport use this evidence to advance existing narratives such as \u201cmillions of illegal immigrants vote\u201d or \u201cDemocrats cheat.\u201d The newsbrokers\u2019 visibility is boosted even more when an elite account \u2014 in this case, Elon Musk\u2019s account \u2014 interacts with them. It is important to note that Elon Musk\u2019s account has not endorsed the claim but rather boosted its visibility.\n\nWe will likely see some variation of this rumor\u2019s return before the 2024 U.S. elections. This particular rumor is valuable to pay attention to because its validation (and/or evidence) comes from a highly contested peer-reviewed study. This scientific validation opens up another level of epistemic authority to endorse the false claims of non-citizen voting in the public space.\n\nPreviously, we have noted that many of these election rumors are inherently conspiratorial since they assume malevolent intent (of political actors) with a secret plot (e.g., mobilizing non-citizens to vote and alter election results). Since non-citizen voting became a salient issue in the 2024 elections, it will be crucial to understand its causes (e.g., the migrant crisis at the border), its implications for U.S. public opinion, and the pattern of its reemergence and spread on social media platforms.\n\nFor further reading about misinformation about science:\n\nWest, J.

        "text": "What led to the rise \u2014 and then fall \u2014 of participatory democracy in Colombia? \u2013 Ash Center\nA decade ago, economic planners in Colombia earmarked nearly one-third of the country\u2019s territory for mining interests. Planners promised oil, gas, and mining operations would benefit local communities \u2014 but residents weren\u2019t convinced. As extractive industries expanded across Colombia, so did protests.\n\nBy 2013, residents in the small farming town of Piedras, in the department of Tolima, had spent years fighting what was predicted to be one of the world\u2019s biggest open-pit gold mines. Concerned about the environmental impacts, they launched a nonviolent campaign, organizing protests and road blockades to halt the project.\n\nWhen those efforts failed, they were inspired to try something new. Organizers looked to the country\u2019s constitution, which detailed a method for holding a local referendum known as a \u201cconsulta popular\u201d \u2014 a popular consultation. They held a vote and asked the municipality\u2019s residents: should the mining project be developed? When the results came back with a resounding \u201cno,\u201d other towns and anti-extraction organizers nationwide quickly became interested in the participatory practice.\n\nJamie Shenk, a democracy postdoctoral fellow at the Ash Center from 2022-2024, watched as the consulta popular spread across the country in the following years. Shenk, who had already completed a master\u2019s degree in Latin American studies, was fascinated by how communities resisted natural resource extraction attempts through a participatory mechanism. When it came time to pursue her doctorate, she already had her research topic.\n\nWhat is \u201cconsulta popular\u201d?\n\n\u201cAt its simplest level, basically consulta popular is a yes-no vote that can be held on any topic,\u201d says Shenk, who completed her doctorate in sociology at the University of Oxford in 2022. \u201cIt\u2019s a referendum.\u201d While the vote can be called by elected officials, such as the mayor or governor, the people can also convene it. For the vote to be legally binding, at least 30% of the population must participate.\n\nAs a mechanism, consulta popular was enshrined in Colombia\u2019s 1991 constitution. Initially, it was sparsely used and typically addressed apolitical questions, such as changing the local market day from Tuesday to Thursday. However, after its success in Piedras, its popularity surged across the country. Today, consulta popular exists across Latin America, including in Peru, Argentina, Guatemala, and, most recently, Mexico. However, according to Shenk, Colombians have used this participatory mechanism more than any other country in the region.\n\nA not-so-direct path to direct democracy\n\nThe Democracy Postdoctoral Fellowship at the Ash Center is an opportunity for recent doctoral students to expand their research before they formally enter the academic job market. While at the Ash Center, Shenk conducted fieldwork to complement a unique database she had previously compiled on consulta popular mobilizations across Colombia.\n\nShenk\u2019s research showed that as consulta popular grew as a tool to oppose extractive industries, organizers quickly faced resistance. \u201cThere\u2019s pushback at every stage basically because citizens are fighting against massive interests,\u201d explains Shenk. \u201cThere was a really strong pressure campaign by both companies \u2026 and the national government against local leaders and local officials who wanted to implement the mechanism.\u201d\n\nThe power imbalance between local communities and oil, gas, and mining interests was stark, and Shenk\u2019s research demonstrated that these interests, both from private companies and the government, could be formidable counterweights to consulta popular blocking them at almost every turn. For example, companies often hired legal counsel to challenge the consulta popular process, submitting so many appeals that the voting process would last for months or even years. Meanwhile, federal and local officials withheld funding and infrastructure for elections.\n\nAt the same time, local communities were able to tap into expert allies, such as larger NGOs and other advocacy groups, to help counter these pressure tactics. In many cases, activists with consulta popular experience would travel to other regions to share lessons learned and other strategies for navigating potential roadblocks. According to Shenk, a balanced power dynamic often determined whether a referendum mobilization would result in a vote.\n\nUltimately, federal interests curbed the use of consulta popular at the local level. In 2017, when a consulta popular blocked an oil project in the town of Cumaral, the oil company filed a legal challenge that made its way to the constitutional court. The court, whose composition had shifted to favor the country\u2019s powerful mining interests, ruled that referendums couldn\u2019t be used to block projects in the country\u2019s national interest. As a scholar of participatory democracy, Shenk was dismayed by the effective dismantling of consulta popular, but she also recognized that the court\u2019s decision demonstrated just how popular the mechanism had become.\n\n\u201cJamie\u2019s research sheds light on an important democratic problem and shows the way forward: why has the \u2018participatory turn\u2019 in many Latin American political institutions sometimes democratized politics but often failed to do so?\u201d says Ash Center Director Archon Fung. \u201cShe shows how the benefits of participatory arrangements depend both on communities\u2019 histories and specific configurations of institutions and the powerful actors affecting vulnerable communities.\u201d\n\nDoes armed conflict exposure impact participation?\n\nThough the court\u2019s decision was a blow for consulta populares, they continue to be used in Colombia today. Shenk found this deep culture and tradition of participatory democracy intriguing, given that the country had only recently achieved peace after years of war.\n\nAfter nearly half a century of fighting, the years-long conflict between the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the government ended in 2016. The conflict left an indelible scar on much of the country. As a conflict studies scholar, Shenk was interested in continuing her doctoral research now with a focus on the connection between participatory democracy and Colombia\u2019s post-conflict recovery. Specifically, she wanted to examine how civilians\u2019 experiences during the conflict impacted their levels of participatory engagement after the war. With the time provided by the Ash fellowship, Shenk set out to build on her previous work and find the answer.\n\nBy the time the peace agreement was reached, people throughout Colombia had been regularly exposed to nearly unimaginable levels of violence. Studying consulta popular mobilizations, Shenk found that exposure to conflict positively affected engagement in consulta activities. In short, it seemed to lead to greater participation in direct democracy.\n\n\u201cThere are different ways that violence can affect the social fabric of a community,\u201d says Shenk. \u201cIn some instances, it can strengthen bonds, as community members lean on each other for support or to resist the violence in any way they can. It can also strengthen community leadership when leaders learn how to negotiate and work around armed groups to support their community.\u201d\n\nIn the unique case of Colombia, the FARC allowed some local communities in areas under their control to exert a degree of autonomy over their affairs. Shenk found that this enabled civilian activist networks to survive and later served as the basis for organizing post-conflict consulta populares.\n\nStill, Shenk says that the exact mechanisms of why exposure to violence can result in increased participation aren\u2019t completely understood. \u201cIn other instances, violence can foster paranoia and deteriorate trust between community members. The exact nature of the violence and armed group presence \u2014 and how that varies across the country \u2014 I think has a lot to do with why communities may or may not feel that they can turn to state-based mechanisms, like direct democracy.\u201d\n\nAn interdisciplinary approach\n\nThis latest research effort is one example of how Shenk\u2019s interdisciplinary research, combining conflict and democratic studies, benefited from the diverse voices at the Ash Center. \u201cIt has been so helpful to think about how people outside of my silos approach my work and what they have to add,\u201d she affirms.\n\nShenk attributes her time at the Ash Center to expanding her interests and making her more open to different disciplines \u2014 a perspective that\u2019s allowed her to embark on new adventures. After completing her fellowship this spring, Shenk moved into a new role as an assistant professor of Sociology at the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom.\n\nReflecting on what she\u2019s learned from participatory movements in Latin America, Shenk emphasized the importance of studying the strong bond between people, community, and nature. \u201cIf I can impart one thing to my future students, it would be to understand the different relationships between humans and the environment and how humans shape the environment,\u201d she says, \u201cbut also how humans are just one part of an environment that also shapes them.\u201d",

        "text": "How to Watch the U.S. Presidential Debates in the U.K.\nThe first debate of the U.S. presidential election, featuring President Joe Biden and Donald Trump, former President and current Republican nominee, will take place on June 27. This comes after the Biden campaign proposed an unusually early date for a debate. The second debate will take place on Sep. 10.\n\nBiden and Trump faced off previously for two debates in September and October during the 2020 presidential election, where they famously engaged in harsh attacks on each other. Trump repeatedly insulted Biden\u2019s intelligence while Biden called Trump \u201cthe worst President America\u2019s ever had.\u201d\n\nWhile viewers inside the U.S. will be the main audience for the debates, politically-minded people across the globe may also wish to tune in. Here\u2019s what people in the U.K. need to know about the U.S. presidential debates.\n\nHow can viewers in the U.K. watch the first U.S. presidential debate?\n\nCNN\u2019s online streaming differs depending on which country you are in. Viewers can watch the debate by tuning into CNN International, which can be found at channel 506 on Sky TV, per CNN International PR's social media.\n\nU.K. viewers also have the option of signing up to CNN Live\u2019s U.K.-specific plan\u2014it costs \u00a31.99 per month or \u00a319.90 per year. Once viewers are logged in, they can livestream the debate online.\n\nBut perhaps the easiest option for many U.K. persons will be to tune into the BBC. The debate will be available to watch on the BBC News Channel, BBC One, and BBC iPlayer from 2 a.m. local time on Friday, June 28.\n\nDid you know you can watch the first US Presidential Debate across @BBCNews, @BBCiPlayer and @BBCOne?\n\n\n\nGet all the info \u2935\ufe0f https://t.co/JOtTZy3W2h \u2014 BBC Press Office (@bbcpress) June 27, 2024\n\nWhat time is the first U.S. presidential election debate?\n\nThe first debate will take place on Thursday, June 27, at 9 p.m. ET, which will be 2 a.m. June 28 BST. The broadcast will go on for 90 minutes and is set to feature two commercial breaks.\n\nIf you miss the live broadcast, CNN international will replay the broadcast at 7 a.m. and 7.pm on June 28 BST.\n\nWho is moderating the first U.S. presidential election debate?\n\nThe first debate will be moderated by CNN journalists Jake Tapper and Dana Bash. Tapper is the lead Washington D.C. anchor for CNN and hosts the show The Lead with Jake Tapper. Dana Bash is a CNN news anchor and host of the show Inside Politics. Tapper and Bash also co-host the Sunday CNN talk show State of the Union, which features interviews with prominent politicians and analysts. The second debate will be hosted by ABC news. Further details on that debate have yet to be announced.\n\nWhat are the rules of the first U.S. presidential debate of 2024?\n\nThis debate will feature new rules that were not implemented in previous presidential debates. Microphones will be muted throughout the debate, unless it is the candidate\u2019s allotted time to speak. It will also not have a live audience, to minimize disruptions. Pre-written notes will also be prohibited, though candidates will be given a pen and a pad of paper. \u201c[CNN] will use all tools at their disposal to enforce timing and ensure a civilized discussion,\u201d the network said.",

        "text": "Why RFK Jr. didn't qualify for the first presidential debate\nThe clock struck midnight on Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s window to qualify for CNN's June 27 general election debate, and the network formally announced that he won't make the stage. That hour on Thursday marked the deadline to meet CNN's qualification requirements, which included being constitutionally eligible to become president, having at least four qualifying national polls with at least 15 percent support that meet CNN's guidelines and having confirmed ballot access in enough states to potentially win a majority in the Electoral College (270 electoral votes). Kennedy ultimately came up short on both polls and ballot access in his bid to get a spot on the debate stage alongside President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump.\n\nBut even though Kennedy didn't qualify, his legal challenge to the debate is still ongoing. In late May, Kennedy's campaign filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging that the CNN debate violates campaign finance law because the network \"colluded\" with the Biden and Trump campaigns in planning the debate and is using different ballot access rules for the two major-party contenders compared with Kennedy. CNN has said that Kennedy's complaint is unfounded. All in all, it seems unlikely \u2014 although not impossible \u2014 that the FEC will intervene on Kennedy\u2019s behalf.\n\nHere then is a look at Kennedy's qualification situation and the legal wrangling that could play into the CNN debate.\n\nKennedy ended up short on polls and ballot access\n\nOn the polling front, Kennedy's situation was pretty cut and dried: He had three national polls at 15 percent or better that qualify under CNN's rules, which means he needed one more at that level of support. However, Kennedy likely missed his final shot at a fourth poll when Beacon Research/Shaw & Co. Research/Fox News released a national survey on Wednesday evening that found him at 10 percent.\n\nAlthough he's polled at around 9 to 10 percent in 538's national polling average since mid-March, Kennedy's support level from survey to survey has varied enough that getting to 15 percent in four qualifying polls seemed plausible for him when CNN released its debate criteria in May. However, Kennedy has hit that mark in just three of the 14 eligible national surveys of registered or likely voters that included him as an option. Still, a small bit of variation in the result of just one other survey would have allowed him to meet CNN's polling criteria \u2014 after all, he hit 14 percent in two qualifying surveys.\n\nYet even if he had gotten a fourth poll, Kennedy sat well shy of CNN's requirement for ballot access at the end of the qualifying period. Unlike the major-party nominees, independent and third-party contenders aren't all but guaranteed ballot access in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, so they must navigate each state's rules for garnering a spot on the ballot \u2014 a process that usually involves gathering a sizable number of petition signatures. Kennedy's campaign claims to have made the ballot in 23 states worth 310 electoral votes, but CNN said last Saturday that it had only confirmed he'd made the ballot in six states worth 89 electoral votes. Earlier this week, ABC News confirmed that Tennessee has also put Kennedy on the ballot, but that still gives Kennedy only 100 potential electoral votes \u2014 far short of the 270 he needs to meet the debate requirement.\n\nTo reach 270 potential electoral votes, Kennedy would have needed, at a minimum, nine of the 16 unconfirmed states his campaign claims access in to confirm that he's made the ballot \u2014 a tall order. Recognized minor parties with ballot access in Florida (30 electoral votes) and South Carolina (9) have announced Kennedy as their presidential nominee, and Kennedy's We The People Party appears on the cusp of having access in North Carolina (16), so he might credibly say he's at 155 electoral votes. But that would still leave him needing confirmation in most of the medium-to-large states on his list \u2014 such as Texas (40), New York (28), Ohio (17), New Jersey (14), Washington (12) and Minnesota (10) \u2014 along with perhaps one or two smaller states.\n\nOngoing litigation over Kennedy's ballot status has potentially delayed confirmations in some states, too. For instance, Nevada's secretary of state said the campaign's petitions in the state were likely invalid under state law because they didn't list Nicole Shanahan, Kennedy's vice presidential running mate. While Kennedy's campaign has mounted a lawsuit over the issue, it has also begun efforts to recollect signatures with a new petition form in the meantime.\n\nA debatable legal situation\n\nBut Kennedy is also waging a more direct legal battle over the debate qualification situation: He's filed an FEC complaint alleging that CNN's debate violates campaign finance rules. Based on federal law, the organization staging a debate must determine candidate inclusion based on preestablished objective criteria, and, for a general election debate, a candidate's nomination by a particular party cannot be used as the lone factor. Otherwise, the event could be seen as a contribution to the debate participants, subject to campaign finance limits \u2014 which the cost of a debate would almost certainly run well beyond.\n\nWith this in mind, the Kennedy campaign contends that CNN \"colluded\" with the Biden and Trump campaigns to set the debate criteria and make sure that they were the only two candidates on stage. It also argued that CNN is using different qualification criteria for Biden and Trump by mandating that Kennedy meet the 270-electoral vote ballot status requirement even though the two major-party contenders won't be formally nominated \u2014 and thus secure ballot access as their respective parties' nominees \u2014 until their conventions happen later this summer. In response, a CNN spokesperson said in May that \"the law in virtually every state provides that the nominee of a state-recognized political party will be allowed ballot access without petitioning. As the presumptive nominees of their parties both Biden and Trump will satisfy this requirement.\"\n\nDerek T. Muller, a professor at the University of Notre Dame Law School who studies election law, told me that the Kennedy campaign's case for collusion may not be particularly strong. Although CNN clearly engaged with the Biden and Trump campaigns as it put together the debate, Muller felt CNN might \"have a good leg to stand on\" because the network adopted qualification criteria similar to what the Commission on Presidential Debates has long used for its debates and planned to use for any it hosted this cycle: a 15 percent polling threshold and minimum ballot access threshold. In theory, CNN could have created criteria that would have been nigh impossible for Kennedy to meet, such as a 30 percent polling threshold, but chose not to. Minor parties and candidates have previously challenged such criteria, only for the courts to consistently uphold the CPD's rules. \"There's pretty robust precedent that at least the things that the CPD has used in the past are acceptable criteria,\" Muller said.\n\nHowever, Muller said the Kennedy campaign may have a stronger case that CNN has failed to consistently apply its qualification rule regarding ballot access. \"Biden and Trump are not the nominees. They're not on the ballot in any state,\" Muller said. \"So CNN has had to massage that criteria and say, 'Well, they're the presumptive nominees, and we expect they will be on the ballot.'\" That this is the earliest general election debate ever is part of the issue: Although the CPD uses similar criteria, its debates have always come after Labor Day, by which time ballot certification has concluded in all or nearly all states, making it more straightforward to assess ballot access as a criterion.\n\nYet even if Kennedy's complaint has merit, the FEC may not take action, in part because of partisanship. The FEC has six members \u2014 three Democrats and three Republicans \u2014 and four commissioners would have to agree to pursue a case against CNN, necessitating at least some degree of bipartisanship. The Biden campaign clearly doesn't want Kennedy on stage, so it may be unlikely that any of the Democrats would break ranks to join three Republicans to vote to move forward with a case \u2014 if the three Republicans had any interest in doing that. (While there has been a recent run of bipartisan agreements among the Republican trio and one Democratic member to loosen some campaign finance rules, Muller wasn't sure that trend was either sustainable or applicable to questions surrounding a debate.)\n\nMeanwhile, Muller noted past ideological opposition among Republican commissioners to FEC intervention in media-run debates. In 2015, a little-known GOP presidential contender named Mark Everson filed an unsuccessful FEC complaint against Fox News over the broadcaster's choice to change its preestablished criteria for qualification to the first Republican primary debate of the 2016 cycle. The newsiest part of the proceedings was a 4-2 FEC vote determining that Fox News's debate rules had not violated the law. But another vote in the proceedings may have particular relevance here: All three GOP commissioners also felt the FEC regulations themselves were invalid and supported a separate motion that said the FEC lacked the power to investigate Fox News (the motion failed 3-3).\n\n\"The three Republican members said, 'We think there's a First Amendment issue here, and we can't even get involved in the first place,'\" Muller told me. \"Who are we to tell the campaigns or debate organizations what they can and can't do as a media entity?\"\n\nEven if four commissioners agreed to move forward with a case, time is running short for the FEC to issue a ruling to compel CNN to put Kennedy on the stage. Even if such an order came just before the debate, CNN could challenge it in court, which could push any resolution beyond June 27. And a ruling that came after the CNN debate (i.e., issuing a fine on CNN) wouldn't help Kennedy in that debate, or in the next general election debate that ABC News plans to host in September. By then, the matter of whether Kennedy has sufficient ballot access should be unambiguous.\n\nKennedy is trying to become the first third-party or independent presidential candidate to make a general election debate since Ross Perot in 1992, but barring unexpected and swift action by the FEC, it looks like he'll have to hope for success in September instead.",

        "text": "Winklevoss Twins Say They Each Gave $1 Million to Trump Presidential Campaign\nTyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the executives atop Gemini, gave $1 million each to the campaign of former President Donald Trump, the two announced on X.\n\nThe two had already been major donors for 2024 U.S. campaigns, each previously giving about $2.7 million, mostly to the industry's super PAC, Fairshake.\n\nPortions of the contributions were reportedly refunded by the campaign fund to comply with legal limits on individual donors.\n\nGemini CEO Tyler and his twin brother Cameron Winklevoss, the company's president, have made two of the first major presidential contributions from prominent crypto executives, favoring former President Donald Trump with $1 million each in support, Tyler explained Thursday in a extensive posting on X.\n\n\"Over the past few years, the Biden Administration has openly declared war against crypto,\" Winklevoss began in the lengthy case against President Joe Biden's administration. \"It has weaponized multiple government agencies to bully, harass, and sue the good actors in our industry in an effort to destroy it.\"\n\nStory continues below Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the State of Crypto Newsletter today. See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy .\n\nGemini was targeted last year in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission case that accused the exchange of offering unregistered securities, which Tyler Winklevoss called at the time a \"manufactured parking ticket.\" His explanation for supporting Trump was much more about opposing Biden.\n\n\"President Donald J. Trump is the pro-Bitcoin, pro-crypto, and pro-business choice,\" he concluded.\n\nTyler Winklevoss said he used Trump's recently established willingness to take crypto contributions and gave his contribution in the form of 15.47 bitcoin, and his brother posted later that he'd done the same. The money went to the Trump 47 Committee Inc., according to a spokeswoman.\n\nPart of each million was reportedly returned to the executives, though, to comply with donation limits, Bloomberg reported on Friday. Individuals are only allowed to give at a level less than $850,000 per individual for Trump 47, which is a \"joint fundraising committee\" that's organized to divide the amount to comply with legal limits for campaign contributions, meaning the money could be spread across a longer list of Republican benefactors. It's unclear what the brothers intended to do with the extra portions refunded to them.\n\nTyler and Cameron Winklevoss have \u2013 all along \u2013 donated matching amounts to U.S. election efforts. It was already a large sum that placed them among the major individual contributors in the 2024 campaigns. Before today, the two had given a total of about $2.7 million each, according to Federal Election Commission disclosures. On the presidential level, they'd already backed most of the prominent contenders that had tried earlier to yank the Republican nomination out from under Trump: Vivek Ramaswamy, Nikki Haley, Sen. Tim Scott and Florida Gov. Ron Desantis.\n\nThe bulk of their donations, however, have been to the industry's main political action committee (PAC), Fairshake. Their combined $5 million represents a small but significant share of the Fairshake super PAC contributions that have now almost reached $169 million. That money has been devoted to buying outside ads for congressional candidates in the hope of loading Congress with crypto supporters.\n\nThe Winklevoss donations to Trump 47 join similar maxed-out contributions from Jeffrey Sprecher, the founder, chairman, and CEO of Intercontinental Exchange, and his wife Kelly Lynn Loeffler, a former U.S. senator and CEO of Bakkt; Joe Ricketts, the founder and former CEO of TD Ameritrade; and Robert Bigelow, who owns Budget Suites of America and founded the now-defunct Bigelow Aerospace.\n\nUpdated (6/21/24, 19:50 UTC): The Trump campaign can only legally accept $844,600 per person. The Winklevoss brothers were each refunded the amount they donated above that limit, according to Bloomberg.\n\nNikhilesh De contributed reporting.\n\nRead More: Jump Crypto Adds $10M to Industry's U.S. Political War Chest, Raising PAC to $169M\n\nUPDATE (June 21, 2024, 20:56 UTC): Adds reporting on portions of the contributions being refunded by the campaign committee.",

Here\u2019s Jason now to explain the format.\n\nJason Isaacson:\n\nWe had a coin toss, and Morgan won the coin toss, and will go first. Each of them will have two minutes to provide opening statements. There will be the opportunity for a minute of rebuttal afterwards, then we'll plunge into a series of questions that I'll be posing to each of them. Morgan, you\u2019re up.\n\nMorgan Ortagus:\n\nThank you so much for having me. I want to start this discussion today really telling a few stories from my time in the Trump administration, but also talking about this from a policy perspective.\n\nFor those of you who don't know me, I've actually served in multiple administrations, including in the Obama administration, as well. And I say that to provide the context that I think the State of Israel cannot have a relationship with just one political party in the United States, just as we pray for the success of Israel. I pray for the success of our leaders, whomever wins in November. And I think no matter what happens today, in this debate in November, we must stand with our ally, we must stand with the State of Israel.\n\nYou know, what's amazing is, I think about four years ago, I was standing in the Oval Office after many, many months of having worked with Secretary Pompeo, Jared Kushner, and the entire team on something that you all came to learn about called the Abraham Accords. And in that moment, I was pregnant with my daughter Adina Ann, this beautiful Jewish baby. And I thought to myself, the Middle East has entirely changed for her. This is going to be so radically different.\n\nFast forward three and a half years later, to see October 7th and what happened that day, the worst killing of the Jewish people in any single day since the Holocaust. It felt like everything I had worked on in Abraham Accords had been shattered. But I am here to say that there is hope, with the right president, with the right policies.\n\nAnd that's what I really want to talk about today. With the right policies, we can get back to an era, not only have a strong America, a strong Israel, and a much stronger Middle East, happy to debate the policies. I'm not a campaign person.\n\nBut I do believe that under the Trump administration, under Mike Pompeo, we had the right policies that were best for Israel, and best for the Middle East. So I guess as the famous song goes, all I'm here to say is give Trump a chance.\n\nJason Isaacson:\n\nMorgan, thank you. Halie Soifer.\n\nHalie Soifer:\n\nJason, Morgan, AJC, thank you for having me. And thank you for your efforts advocating for the Jewish people for Israel and defending democratic values. I'm grateful for your work, which has made a difference, and particularly grateful for the leadership of your CEO, my friend, Ted Deutch.\n\nThis is the third time I've joined AJC's Great Debate in advance of an election with Joe Biden and Donald Trump on the ballot. The first was in 2019. The second was 2020. But 2024 is different for three reasons. First, the stakes of this election are higher. Second, the positions of the two candidates have never been more clear or divergent. And third, both candidates have been president before and can and should be judged on their records.\n\nUnlike the last debate, this is no longer a hypothetical in terms of what kind of President Joe Biden or Donald Trump would be. We know the answer. Joe Biden has sought to restore the soul of America by taking unprecedented steps to combat antisemitism and bigotry, while Donald Trump has emboldened, echoed and aligned with dangerous extremists and antisemites.\n\nJoe Biden is a self declared Zionist who has stood with Israel for more than five decades, including after October 7, when he pledged his staunch support of Israel and the Jewish people. While Donald Trump is a self declared dictator on day one, who marched Israel's leaders and praised Hezbollah after October 7.\n\nBest summarized by his former national security adviser John Bolton, who told the New York Times, Trump's support of Israel is not guaranteed in a second term. Joe Biden is an ardent defender of democracy, while Donald Trump incited a deadly insurrection in order to stop the peaceful transfer of power in the last election, and is preparing to weaponize the US government as an act of political retribution. If he wins the next one. And let's not forget, he's also a twice-impeached, 34-time convicted felon. So three times is clearly a charm. There's plenty to debate and I'm happy to be here. Thanks.\n\nJason Isaacson:\n\nVery good. Thank you, Halie. You can each rebut the others statements. Morgan, would you like to say a word?\n\nMorgan Ortagus:\n\nI think the only response I would have to that is do you feel safer as a Jew in America today than you did four years ago? That's it.\n\nJason Isaacson:\n\nHalie, would you like to say anything in response?\n\nHalie Soifer:\n\nSure. Four years ago, I mentioned I joined this debate. We did so via zoom, where we were in our home stuck for more than a year. It was an unprecedented pandemic that really epitomized Donald Trump's leadership. He was ignorant, chaotic or erratic, and demonstrated a reckless disregard for a fundamental Jewish value, pikuach nefesh--the sanctity of life. Since Joe Biden has become president, we emerged from this dark period, the economy has grown. Unemployment is at a 50 year low. And yes, antisemitism has risen, including after the horrific attacks perpetrated by Hamas on October 7, and our unequivocal condemnation of this violence and of rising antisemitism is something on which I'm sure we agree, Morgan, and you know, who else agrees with us, Joe Biden. On May 2, he said in response to the campus protests, there should be no place on any campus or any place in America for antisemitism. It's simply wrong.\n\nJason Isaacson:\n\nThank you. Okay. Let's get into the questions if I could begin with you, Morgan. As you know, in election after election over the last century, a substantial majority of Jews have voted for Democratic presidential candidates over Republican candidates, the sharpest differences were under FDR in the 1940s and the Johnson Goldwater election of 1964, when Democrats were reported to have scored 90% of the Jewish vote, but Harry Truman, Bill Clinton, Al Gore and Barack Obama weren't far behind, and Joe Biden was reported to have led Donald Trump four years ago, according to Pew by 70%, to 27%. AJC's latest polling shows a somewhat narrower gap, but still has President Biden beating former President Trump by more than two to one among American Jews. If these numbers are predictive and accurate, how does the Republican Party break through that traditional Democratic predisposition among Jewish voters and why does it matter?\n\nMorgan Ortagus:\n\nI think there's a couple ways to unpack that first, I think there's a big difference between saying the right thing and doing the right thing. There's no doubt that the Biden administration, the Biden-Harris administration is great on the rhetoric. But I would say that the policy is lacking. First of all, I think most Jewish voters care about Israel care about antisemitism in this country. But let me just also say that I think Jewish voters, Jewish moms and grandmas in this audience, Jewish parents, you care about things that I care about in Nashville, Tennessee, which is the price of groceries, which is filling up your car with gasoline, which is all of the things that matter to all of us as consumers.\n\nAnd it is not a good time in America for the American family. People are making real decisions, whether to fill up their gas tank or whether to fill up their cart full of groceries. That happens in real America in Nashville, Tennessee, where I live. I would also say that, you know, Lindsey Graham said this to me once and it really made me laugh. He said about Trump, I've never seen somebody so willing to cut off their own arm just to spite him. And he certainly incites a lot of heated emotion and passion.\n\nBut again, I would get back to the question that I asked you, do you feel more safe as a Jew in America today than you did four years ago? Do you think our policies are stronger at protecting Israel, with standing with our ally than they were four years ago, I would argue that we have turned the Middle East on its head in the past four years by beginning at the beginning of this administration to spend the past three and a half years, chasing the Islamic Republic around the world, begging and cajoling and pleading with them to get back into a nuclear deal, giving them billions of dollars in sanctions relief by not enforcing those sanctions. That was three and a half years of policies that led to events like October 7. We also saw multiple times at the UN, including yesterday, ways in which that I think the Biden administration has sold Israel down the river. has not stood up for them at the United Nations or on the world stage. And so I'm quite simply argue that the Middle East is chaotic today, specifically from the policies of the past three years that were put in place by the Biden Administration.\n\nJason Isaacson:\n\nThank you, Morgan. Halie, you can respond if you wish. You have a minute.\n\nHalie Soifer:\n\nWell, as a Jewish mom, I can say I absolutely feel safer knowing that Joe Biden is in the White House because he shares our values, our fundamental values, our Jewish values, defending democracy, and of course, support of Israel.\n\nA lot of Republicans mentioned Donald Trump's move of the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in 2017. Something we agree with\u2013Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. What we don't mention enough is that in August of 2020, Donald Trump said he did that for the evangelicals, which demonstrates two things.\n\nOne, Donald Trump's Israel policy has always been based on his self interests. His own former national security adviser has revealed that in an article in The New York Times in early April, and also it\u2019s clear that Donald Trump has great animus toward the vast majority of Jewish Americans, those who vote for Democrats because of it.. He has called us disloyal. He has called us uninformed. He has said we hate Israel, we hate our religion, we should be ashamed of ourselves. We're loyal to our values, which is why the overwhelming majority of us support Democrats.\n\nJason Isaacson:\n\nHalie, I want to ask you a different version, or the pretty much the same version of the question that I asked Morgan at the beginning, why it matters where the Jewish vote is. Remembering that the Israeli newspaper Haaretz had a piece after the 2020 election, that maintained it was Jewish voters in Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona who actually made the crucial difference in that tight race moving those swing states and their deciding Electoral College votes into the Biden column. Although polling and voting history is obviously on your side, there are signs of slippage for President Biden in our own polling and in other samples. Some of that may have to do with the President's being seen as inappropriately pushing the Israeli government in ways that didn't want to go in the conduct of the war against Hamas. And in a post conflict path to Palestinian statehood. Some of it may be factors that have nothing to do with Israel or with the Jewish community, but reflect attitudes in the general population. Why the slippage and how are you addressing it?\n\nHalie Soifer:\n\nWell, Jason, you're right. The Jewish vote absolutely matters. The states you mentioned, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Arizona determined the outcome of the 2020 election and may do so again in 2024. Joe Biden won those three states in total by just over 100,000 voters. And in those states the Jewish vote, and even more said the Jewish vote that supported Joe Biden was exponentially higher than the margin by which he won. So where are Jewish voters in 2024? Well, 74% of Jewish voters supported Democrats in our last election in the 2022 midterms. It's the same amount approximately three quarters who have supported Democrats historically, and it's the amount I predict will support Joe Biden in this election for two reasons. One, Joe Biden represents the vast majority of Jewish voters on every key issue, domestic policy, democracy, abortion, access, guns, climate change the economy, antisemitism, and foreign policy, Israel, Ukraine and defending democracy abroad. And too, Jewish voters overwhelmingly disapprove of and oppose Donald Trump in 2016, in 2020, and they're going to do it again in 2024. Because there's even more reasons to oppose him now, going into a potential second term.\n\nAJC's new poll only confirms this. The poll indicates that both Joe Biden and Donald Trump have essentially the same amount of support\u201361%/23%--among Jewish voters as they did among that same group of voters in 2020, when it was 64%/21%. Donald Trump has not broken 25%. It also shows that Jewish voters trust Biden more than Trump on Israel by a two to one margin and on antisemitism by three to one margin.\n\nSo AJC is consistent in its polling, and it's consistent with what we've seen in other polling as well that Jewish voters will continue to overwhelmingly support Democrats and Joe Biden, especially with Donald Trump on the ballot.\n\nJason Isaacson:\n\nMorgan, you may respond.\n\nMorgan Ortagus:\n\nAgain, you know, I'd say there's a big difference between rhetoric and policy action. The truth is, the reality is, there has never been a more unsafe time in America, for Jews, especially young Jews on college campuses. Today, the antisemitism unveiled and unchecked during the Biden administration should scare all of us. The fact that Jewish students have to make decisions if they want to wear a yarmulke, if they want to wear a Star of David, if they want to openly embrace Judaism in the United States of America is a stain on the Biden administration.\n\nAnd something that I think that there has been no real action. In 2019, again, I'm going to keep going back to policy because when you have bad policy, you have to run on rhetoric. When you have good policy, you can talk about things that we did like the executive order to combat antisemitism in 2019. That executive order focused on criminalizing antisemitism, basically bringing it up to the level of any other persecution against, you know, sex, gender. We could go through everything in Title Six. That's incredibly important because we have real world ramifications for antisemitism that this administration has ignored.\n\nJason Isaacson:\n\nThank you, Morgan. Let me ask you another question. And I'm going to turn to a foreign policy issue again. Since President Trump in May 2018 pulled the United States out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, calling it a horrible one-sided deal that should never ever have been made. Iran has marched closer and closer to becoming a nuclear threshold state with a stockpile of enriched uranium calculated to be more than 6000 kilograms as of last month, more than 20 times the limit that was set in the nuclear deal. But enough of that uranium enriched to a near weapons grade level to fuel at least three atomic weapons.\n\nIt's been said that the maximum pressure campaign waged in the last year and a half of the Trump administration had little effect on Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons capability. How would you answer the charge that pulling the US out of an unsatisfactory nuclear deal actually made the problem worse? How would a second Trump administration approach this threat from Iran?\n\nMorgan Ortagus:\n\nThanks, now we're getting to my favorite subject. So you don't even have to listen to President Trump on this. You can look at Senator Schumer, Majority Leader at the time in his speech and his debate why he did not support the JCPOA. We know of course, that the JCPOA was never brought before the Senate because it was a bad deal that would never get passed, including by Democrats. Let's also remember that under the JCPOA, we left the deal in 2018 in the Trump administration, at the time and during the entire Trump administration. Iran never exceeded the 5% enrichment. In fact, it didn't happen until the Biden administration and under Biden, they've gone up to an 84% enrichment strategy with zero ramifications. That's enough material to get a bomb within eight months if we wanted to.\n\nMore importantly, Americans and Israelis are dying at the hands of Iran. And why is that? Because once again, you have a Democratic administration who have not enforced sanctions, they got billions of dollars in sanctions relief. About three weeks before October 7, this administration negotiated a deal that I didn't think that could be worse than the JCPOA. But they actually managed to top themselves by promising to give Iran $6 billion for returning five American hostages home. Now, I love getting American hostages home. In fact, in the Trump administration, we got two American hostages home from Iran, guess how much we paid for those hostages, zero. And so there is a way to negotiate to be tough with Iran and to protect Americans.\n\nBut Americans are dying in places like Jordan, from Iranian made drones. We know that American ships are being taxed on a daily basis, again, from material that is supplied to the Hussein's by Iran. And so whenever you reward enemies, like the Islamic Republic of Iran and punish friends like Israel, the Arab states, then you end up with a chaotic Middle East. So the Middle East is on fire today principally because of the appeasement of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Iran will likely get a nuclear weapon in the next administration, if it isn't stopped. President Trump will stop it. President Biden will just beg and plead them to stop.\n\nJason Isaacson:\n\nThank you, Morgan. Halie, you may respond.\n\nHalie Soifer:\n\nWe talked a lot about, of course, the horrific acts of what happened on October 7. What I don't think we talked enough about is what happened on April 13, when Iran launched over 300 projectiles at Israel and an unprecedented direct attack. In the end, Israel survived that attack relatively unscathed. Miraculously, because Joe Biden had deployed two aircraft carriers to the eastern Mediterranean preparing for such attacks, and had encouraged a coalition, Arab partners, to stand with Israel and directly intercepted over 100 ballistic missiles. It was the first time the US military had been deployed to prevent a direct attack on Israel.\n\nFollowing the attack, Biden took steps to hold Iran accountable, including imposing new sanctions and exports control on Iran. The sanctions targeted leaders and entities connected to the IRGC, the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps. During the Biden administration, the US has sanctioned over 600 individuals and entities including Iran and its proxies. And the President has directed the administration to continue to impose sanctions that further degrade Iran\u2019s military. This is on top of the Trump era sanctions against Iran that Biden kept in place. So Joe Biden has demonstrated great strength in defending against the threat of Iran, especially as it relates to the threat posed by Israel.\n\nJason Isaacson:\n\nThere are increasingly loud and influential voices in the Democratic Party, expressing harsh criticism of Israel's conduct of the war against Hamas in Gaza and among constituencies on which democratic election victories have often depended. There's opposition to Israel more generally, not just to the current war, but to the legitimacy of the Jewish state.\n\nOver the last two years, according to Gallup sympathy for Israelis over Palestinians has slipped among Democrats from a majority to a minority position, although there is still a plurality with more favorable views of Israel versus Palestinian Authority. For comparison among Republicans sympathy for Israelis earlier this year was recorded by Gallup is more than 10 times that for Palestinians. How can President Biden and the party counter the critics and assure that US support for the Middle East's sole democracy remains bipartisan. And how do you respond to the charge that Trump criticism of Israel in progressive circles contributes to attacks on supporters of Israel and incidents of antisemitism?\n\nHalie Soifer:\n\nAntisemitic and anti-Israel views have been expressed by elected officials on both sides of the aisle. Neither party is homogenous in their view on either issue. When antisemitism and or anti-Israel views have emerged among Democrats in Congress, JDCA, our organization has condemned it, and in some cases endorsed a primary opponent to anti Israel, Democratic incumbents.\n\nThere are two such primaries that we're engaged in right now as we speak in New York and in Missouri, to elect Democrats who share our values. There are some Democrats who have opposed or proposed conditioning aid to Israel, something which JDCA opposes. But House Republicans, including their entire leadership, recklessly delayed essential military aid for Israel that Joe Biden pledged in October for six months, at a time when it could not have been needed more.\n\nWhen it comes to antisemitism, there is a sharp difference between how it is handled by the two parties. The Democratic Party marginalizes those who have used antisemitic rhetoric, while the Republican Party has elevated extremists and antisemites, one of whom is at the top of the ticket in the past three election cycles, including this one. Leadership matters, and the words and actions of our leaders matter.\n\nWhen the American people were faced with the same choice for president in 2020, on the debate stage, President Biden implored Donald Trump to condemn white supremacy, we all remember it. Trump blatantly refused, he could not, would not condemn this insidious ideology that motivated the perpetrator of the worst massacre of Jewish Americans in our history two years earlier at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. What did he do instead, he incited dangerous right wing extremists, the Proud Boys to stand back and stand by from the debate stage. And less than four months later, they heated his call on January 6.\n\nThis election is a binary choice. There are two names on this ballot, two men vying to be leader of the free world. One has been a staunch friend and ally of the Jewish people in Israel, since he was first elected to the Senate in 1972. And the other who has always done and will continue to only do what is good for himself.\n\nJason Isaacson:\n\nMorgan, I think you may want to respond.\n\nMorgan Ortagus:\n\nYou know, I will concede, I don't watch MSNBC. And maybe they're just not covering what I see going on in America on a daily basis, which is a Charlottesville every single day in this country, which is the calling for not only supporting Hamas and other terrorist organizations, but calling for the genocide and the extermination of the Jewish people blatantly and openly every single day in this country. You also see yesterday in New York City, while there was a memorial to what happened on October 7, people there openly demonstrating support for more October 7, support for more terrorism.\n\nAnd while that was happening, the United States was shamefully at the United Nations calling for a ceasefire resolution that made us look like we were Hamas\u2019 personal lawyer. If you're a party that doesn't have the moral clarity, to stand by the Jewish faith to just stay defending itself against terrorism, how can you claim to have the moral clarity on anything. I was in Israel three weeks ago Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu told me that in fact, the Biden administration is slow walking military aid that he needs. Just last week in the Congress, the Biden administration was whipping votes against bipartisan ICC sanctions, which are undermining again the leadership of a democratic elected Jewish state.\n\nWe\u2019ll remember famously that after the attack that he talked about a few minutes ago from Iran, Biden famously told Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu for Israel just to take the win essentially. At every turn, then not only tie one hand behind Israel's back, they tie both hands behind the back as they tried to defeat the terrorists that invaded them and by the way, killed Americans on October 7, and the last time I checked, we still have five Americans that are held captive eight months later by a terrorist organization behind enemy lines. Bring them home.\n\nJason Isaacson:\n\nMorgan, you're up. Your last question and President Trump and other leaders of your party had been harshly critical of a range of diversity and equity programs, affirmative action and college admissions and educational curricula that cast a negative light on aspects of American history. And these stances have earned the support and loyalty of among others, individuals and groups with extremist views on race and ethnicity. How do you answer critics, including President Biden, who charge that this so-called anti-woke agenda lends legitimacy and support to forces of intolerance? As you know, there are also accusations that divisive rhetoric can fuel antisemitism. And the example of Charlottesville, which we've been talking about is often cited. How do you counter that, in a minute, if you may.\n\nMorgan Ortagus:\n\nI\u2019ll be very quick and say that I agree with Halie that there is antisemitic problems that happen on both the left and the right, and we must be countering them. And every time it happens, again, I'm a foreign policy professional. I look at the policies. I don't necessarily get involved in domestic politics. But I will say that what we have seen, especially on college campuses, is that DEI and intersectionality are the parents of antisemitism and fostering intolerance. Can anybody look at our college campuses and say this isn't true. I don't think President Biden and vice president Harris are doing enough to rein in anti-Jewish Jewish violence in this country.\n\nLet's look at Biden's so-called efforts, is there more or less antisemitism in our universities? Are there fewer encampments? How about what's happening to the American flag? The last I've seen, the Iranian people have more respect for the American flag and the Israeli flag than liberals on university campuses today. Many students who had to start college online and COVID have gone back to going online because it's unsafe to be Jewish in America in an American university today.\n\nJason Isaacson:\n\nThank you, Morgan. And Halie, we're not going to have rebuttals to these questions.\n\nHalie, your last question: the Iranian threats, foreign policy question. The Iranian threat isn't confined to its accelerated nuclear program. Iranian proxies in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq firing missiles and drones at Israel sometimes with deadly effect. The Iranian supported Hutus in Yemen regularly attack ships in the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean. In recent years, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have come under attack from Iran or its proxies and vessels of many nations, including the US Navy, have been targeted or damaged or seized. Iranian agents abroad from the IRGC, Hezbollah, Hamas and other groups have been implicated in assassination plots, including in our own country.\n\nCritics charge the Biden administration, which yearned from day one to return to the 2015 nuclear deal has failed to confront Iran forcefully over these multiple threats. What's your response? In a minute, if you could?\n\nHalie Soifer:\n\nOk, in order to answer this, you have to go back to May of 2018 when President Trump against the advice of many in the US intelligence community and Israeli security establishment, withdrew from the Iran nuclear agreement. While the JCPOA was not a perfect agreement, Iran was in compliance with it. According to international observers and American intelligence officials. It was effectively verifying restrictions on Iran's nuclear development, as AJC itself said at the time in its own press release, despite our many reservations, we had hoped to see the deal fixed, not next. It was with the same objective. And given the fact that Iran was at that time weeks away from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability.\n\nThe Biden administration explored whether it was possible to reenter the JCPOA and reach a better deal if Iran came back into compliance. In the end, it wasn't possible because Joe Biden refuse to capitulate to Iranian demands, including lifting the terrorists designation on the IRGC, Joe Biden should be praised, not criticized, for working with our allies to explore whether the resumption of a multilateral deal that would contain Israel's nuclear aspirations was possible, and for standing up to Iran, not just by refusing to give in to their demands, but by continuing to implement sanctions against Iran. And as I mentioned, in an unprecedented act, defending Israel against an unprecedented direct attack by the Iranians on April 13.\n\nJason Isaacson:\n\nHalie, thank you. We're gonna go directly to closing statements and Morgan, having won the coin toss, you go first.\n\nMorgan Ortagus:\n\nOkay. You know, Halie just talked about working with allies. How about last week at the IAEA, whenever the E three, the UK, France, Germany, had to actually go and beg and plead us to stand up against Iran at the IAEA which we didn't do. We just talked about the ICC in which bipartisan sanctions are before the Congress that the Biden administration is not only not supporting, they're whipping against and the multiple votes at the UN either abstaining or actually working on ceasefire, right. solutions that undermine the State of Israel.\n\nListen, I would say there's a far big difference between bad rhetoric and bad policy. If you want pretty tweets, vote for Biden, if you don't want dead Israelis and dead Americans vote for Trump. When you look at the people that Biden has empowered in his administration look no further than his Iran envoy, Rob Malley, who was fired, who was under FBI investigation, and also the State Department inspector general investigation because of his leaking of classified information and potential ties to Hamas.\n\nThese are not the people that we will promote and support in the Trump administration. President Trump will defend Israel, he will stand by Israel and things like October 7 won't happen under President Trump. You will have peace like under the Abraham Accords and you will have an Iran that is curtailed because we will actually stand up to them and we will stop them from getting a nuclear weapon.\n\nJason Isaacson:\n\nMorgan, thank you. Halie Soifer, your closing comment?\n\nHalie Soifer:\n\nWell, you will soon hear from Joe Biden's National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, there is no stronger champion of the US Israel relationship. You will see that Maya Angelou famously said when someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time. Whether it's acquainting Neo Nazis with peaceful protesters declaring very fine people on both sides as Donald Trump did after Charlottesville, dining with white supremacists, Nick Fuentes and Kanye West in Mar-a-Lago, quoting Hitler, and reportedly saying he did some good things. Donald Trump has shown us exactly who he is, time and time again. Don't believe me listen to his own words. As has President Biden. And the contrast could not be more stark. This past weekend, President Biden welcomed the heroic rescue of four Israeli hostages and pledged to not stop working until all the hostages are home.\n\nDonald Trump also mentioned those who he refers to as hostages. Are they the more than 100 Israelis and Americans and others being held by Hamas? No. He's referring to incarcerated January 6 insurrectionists. That's who he is. And the American people, the Jewish people, and Israel, deserve far better from a US president and we have far better. He's currently in the White House. President Biden recently said that democracy begins with each of us. He's right. It could also end with each of us. And we each have a responsibility to defend it at the ballot box in November.\n\nJason Isaacson:\n\nHalie, Morgan, thank you. That closes our great debate. Our community, our country have a big decision to make this November. AJC will continue to provide information on the issues that are at stake. And we thank you guys very much and we thank all of you for your attention to this important debate.",

        "text": "6 facts about presidential and vice presidential debates\nJoe Biden and Donald Trump debate in Nashville, Tennessee, on Oct. 22, 2020. (Jim Bourg/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nPresident Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump \u2013 the presumptive major-party nominees for the 2024 presidential election \u2013 will meet in the first of two planned debates on June 27.\n\nThat\u2019s by far the earliest date any such debate has been staged \u2013 so early, in fact, that neither man will have been officially nominated yet. Since the first televised debates in 1960 between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon, all such events have been held in September or October.\n\nThe early date isn\u2019t the only thing setting this year\u2019s debates apart. The June debate is being organized by CNN and the Sept. 10 follow-up by ABC, bypassing the Commission on Presidential Debates. The commission had sponsored all presidential and vice presidential debates since 1988, sharing the broadcast with all channels that wanted to air it. (The commission has proposed a vice presidential debate for Sept. 25, but it\u2019s not yet clear that the Biden and Trump campaigns will agree to participate.)\n\nPresidential debates have long been criticized on both substantive and stylistic grounds, but they remain a major part of the campaign season. Here are six things to know before the first debate.\n\nHow we did this To lay some groundwork for the 2024 presidential debates, we looked back at the history of presidential and vice presidential debates. Data on voters\u2019 perceptions of the debates\u2019 helpfulness and their decision-making process was drawn from previous Pew Research Center surveys. Refer to the links in the text for more methodological detail. Viewership was based primarily on figures from Nielsen Media Research, supplemented by estimates from the Commission on Presidential Debates and, in one case, The New York Times. Other sources included the commission\u2019s records on prior debates and contemporaneous media reports from various publications. Links to these sources can be found in the text of this analysis.\n\nThe debates draw a lot of viewers. Although viewership of the debates as a share of the total TV audience has broadly fallen over the decades, they can still attract more people than just about any other televised event besides the Super Bowl.\n\nMore than 73 million people watched at least some of the first Trump-Biden debate in 2020, according to Nielsen Media Research. (Nielsen defines audience as viewers ages 2 and older.) That\u2019s the third-largest debate audience ever, trailing only the first debate between Hillary Clinton and Trump in 2016 (84 million viewers) and the 1980 debate between President Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan (80.6 million).\n\nOlder people were most likely to watch the first Trump-Biden debate, according to Nielsen. The debate drew a 42.7 rating among viewers ages 55 and older, versus 25.5 among 35- to 54-year-olds and 12.0 among 18- to 34-year-olds. (Nielsen ratings measure the percentage of television-owning households watching a particular program, but the company also collects data on individual viewers.)\n\nThis ratings data can be interpreted in various ways. On one hand, it seems to align with research that shows that older people are more likely to follow presidential election news. However, the Nielsen numbers only included people who watched the debates on traditional TV channels or via devices connected to TV sets (at home or outside the home) \u2013 not those who streamed the debates or watched them online. And according to a 2021 Pew Research Center study, only 34% of U.S. adults under 30 get TV through cable or satellite.\n\nRatings for the presidential debates have risen and fallen over the decades, according to Nielsen data. The four 1960 debates all had ratings of around 60.0, meaning roughly six-in-ten households with TV sets were tuned to the debates. When the debates were revived in 1976, their ratings were lower \u2013 generally around 50.0.\n\nRatings for the debates trended lower over the next two decades. The third debate between Al Gore and George W. Bush in 2000 had just a 25.9 rating. Since then, debate ratings have generally trended modestly upward: The first Biden-Trump debate in 2020 drew a 40.2 rating.\n\nVoters find the debates useful, but not necessarily determinative. Pew Research Center conducted post-election surveys from 1988 through 2016. In most cases, six-in-ten or more voters said the debates were very or somewhat helpful in deciding which candidate to vote for.\n\nThe high point was 1992, when 70% of voters said the three debates that year between Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush and Ross Perot were at least somewhat helpful. (The Center did not ask this question following the 2020 election.)\n\nIn 2016, for example, only 10% of voters said they had definitively made up their minds \u201cduring or just after\u201d the presidential debates. By comparison, 11% said they\u2019d decided later, in the days or weeks before or on Election Day. More (22%) said they had decided during or just after the summertime party conventions, and 42% said they had before the conventions.\n\nThe vice presidential debates are the undercard. In most years since 1976, when the candidates for vice president first had their own debate, the running mates have been runners-up when it comes to viewership.\n\nIn 2020, for example, 57.9 million people watched the debate between Vice President Mike Pence and then-Sen. Kamala Harris. That was 8% below the viewership of the lowest-rated Biden-Trump debate, though well above the 37.2 million who tuned in to the 2016 debate between Pence and Sen. Tim Kaine, the Democratic vice presidential hopeful.\n\nThe lone exception to this rule came in 2008, when more people (69.9 million) tuned in to the vice presidential debate between then-Sen. Biden and then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin than any of the three presidential debates between then-Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain.\n\nToday\u2019s televised debates don\u2019t much resemble the first ones. From the first debates in 1960 between Kennedy and Nixon through the 1988 matchups between George H.W. Bush and Michael Dukakis, the candidates answered questions from panels of journalists. The moderator\u2019s job was mostly to explain and enforce the ground rules and keep the proceedings moving.\n\nBut by the 1980s, the panel format was in trouble. Critics said it resembled a joint press conference more than an actual debate and that the journalist-panelists took too much time and attention away from the candidates. The campaigns bickered constantly over who could or could not be a moderator or panelist.\n\nFinally, the League of Women Voters, which had organized the 1976, 1980 and 1984 debates, threw in the towel, leaving the job to the newly created Commission on Presidential Debates.\n\nIn 1992, the commission tried a variety of approaches: Along with two panel-style debates, it introduced a \u201ctown hall\u201d event in which undecided voters asked the questions. That year\u2019s vice presidential debate had a single moderator pose questions to the candidates.\n\nBased on public feedback afterward, the commission decided to use only the single-moderator and town hall formats going forward. (The lone exception was a 2016 debate that was co-moderated by Anderson Cooper of CNN and Martha Raddatz of ABC News.)\n\nMost of the moderators have been broadcast journalists. All but two of the debate moderators since 1960 have been prominent broadcast journalists. (The exceptions were James Hoge, editor-in-chief of the Chicago Sun-Times, who moderated the 1976 vice presidential debate, and USA Today Washington bureau chief Susan Page, who moderated the 2020 vice presidential debate.)\n\nPBS journalists have moderated the most debates: 16, including 12 by the late Jim Lehrer. The only other person to have moderated more than two presidential or vice presidential debates is Bob Schieffer of CBS News (2004, 2008 and 2012).\n\nNote: This is an update of a post originally published on Aug. 28, 2020.",

Request your ballot. Complete a new Federal Post Card Application (FPCA). You must complete a new FPCA after January 1, 2024, to ensure you receive your ballot for the 2024 elections. Submitting the FPCA allows you to request absentee ballots for all elections for federal offices (President, U.S. Senate, and U.S. House of Representatives) including primaries and special elections during the calendar year in which it is submitted. All local election officials in all U.S. states and territories accept the FPCA.\n\nYou can complete the FPCA online at FVAP.gov. The online voting assistant will ask you questions specific to your state. We encourage you to request your blank ballots be delivered electronically (by email, internet download, or fax, depending on your state). Include your email address on your FPCA to take advantage of the electronic ballot delivery option. Return the FPCA per the instructions on the website. The online voting assistant will tell you if your state allows the FPCA to be returned electronically or if you must submit a paper copy with original ink signature. If you must return a paper version, please follow the same instructions below for returning your ballot.\n\n2. Receive and complete your ballot. States are required to send out ballots 45 days before a regular election for federal office and generally send ballots at least 30 days before primary elections. For most states, you can confirm your registration and ballot delivery online.\n\n3. Return your completed ballot. While some states allow you to return your completed ballot electronically, others do not. If your state requires you to return paper voting forms or ballots to local election officials, you can do so free of charge at the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate. Place your ballot in a postage-paid return envelope, or in an envelope bearing sufficient domestic U.S. postage, and address it to the relevant local election officials.\n\nResearch candidates and issues.

Include your email address on your FPCA to take advantage of the electronic ballot delivery option. Return the FPCA per the instructions on the website. The online voting assistant will tell you if your state allows the FPCA to be returned electronically or if you must submit a paper copy with original ink signature. If you must return a paper version, please follow the same instructions below for returning your ballot.\n\n2. Receive and complete your ballot. States are required to send out ballots 45 days before a regular election for federal office and generally send ballots at least 30 days before primary elections. For most states, you can confirm your registration and ballot delivery online.\n\n3. Return your completed ballot. While some states allow you to return your completed ballot electronically, others do not. If your state requires you to return paper voting forms or ballots to local election officials, you can do so free of charge at the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate. Place your ballot in a postage-paid return envelope, or in an envelope bearing sufficient domestic U.S. postage, and address it to the relevant local election officials.\n\nResearch candidates and issues. Please see the FVAP links page for resources you can use to research candidates and issues. FVAP regularly sends information about election dates and deadlines through their Voting Alerts.

The invitation was extended in accordance with the agreement signed by the government of Venezuela and the Unitary Platform in Barbados in October 2023.\n\nThe international mission will be led by Jennie Lincoln, the Carter Center\u2019s senior advisor on Latin America and the Caribbean. Lincoln and a core team of experts will arrive in Caracas on June 29. Additional electoral experts and regional observers will join the team in July.\n\nThe Carter Center will conduct its mission according to the memorandum of understanding signed with the CNE as well as in accordance with the Declaration of Principles for International Election Observation and the Code of Conduct for International Election Observers, adopted at the United Nations in 2005.\n\nGiven its limited size and scope, the Center\u2019s mission will not conduct a comprehensive assessment of the voting, counting, and tabulation processes. The mission\u2019s assessments will be based on the national legal framework as well as regional and international human rights obligations and standards for democratic elections.\n\nThe Carter Center has observed several elections in Venezuela, most recently in 2021 when it deployed an expert mission for the regional and local elections. The Carter Center has observed 124 full and limited election missions in 40 countries and three Native American nations. In addition, 17 expert missions have been conducted in 15 countries.\n\nTranslation\n\nEl Centro Carter Desplegar\u00e1 Una Misi\u00f3n Electoral para las Elecciones\n\nPresidenciales de Venezuela (PDF)\n\n###\n\nContacts: In Atlanta, Maria Cartaya, maria.cartaya@cartercenter.org\n\nJennie Lincoln, jennie.lincoln@cartercenter.org\n\nThe Carter Center\n\nWaging Peace.

Getting the party more media attention, better ballot access and more Libertarian candidates into local office is also on the docket.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cThere are concrete things we can do to build our party foundation up that don't require us to win the White House this November,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cAnd I think a lot of those things, if done correctly, will be seen as a victory in my eyes and a victory in the eyes of libertarians across the country.\u201d\n\nIn the aftermath of the chaotic Libertarian Party national convention where Oliver eventually secured the party\u2019s nomination after seven rounds of voting (winning with 60.6% against 36.6% for \u201cnone of the above\u201d), his campaign schedule has seen travel across the country to boost his own name recognition and that of the party.\n\ntoggle caption Stephen Fowler, NPR.\n\nAt a low-key campaign kickoff at a brewery east of Atlanta, Oliver told friends, family and running mate Mike ter Maat that he believes the Libertarian Party can reach a younger generation disillusioned with the current status of America.\n\n\u201cOne of the things I\u2019ve heard most is, \u2018I became a libertarian when I was a young person,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, there are 40 million-plus Gen Z voters who are ready to hear a message outside the two-party system.\u201d\n\nAs a millennial politician, Chase Oliver has a different energy on the campaign trail than the buttoned-up Biden or meandering Trump, and is quite vocal about his ideas of what liberty means in theory and in practice.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cBroadly speaking, liberty means the right and the ability to live your own life as you see fit, in peace,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you're not harming someone with force, fraud, coercion, theft or violence, if you're not doing any of those bad things, your life is your life. Your body is your body. Your business is your business, and your property is your property. It's not mine, and it's not the government's.\u201d\n\ntoggle caption Ben Gray/AP\n\nOftentimes, libertarians are seen as spoiler candidates in close races - including Oliver himself, who ran for Georgia\u2019s U.S. Senate seat in 2022 and helped force incumbent Democrat Raphael Warnock into a runoff against Republican Herschel Walker.\n\nStill, Oliver wants the party to grow up, and grow into something that\u2019s appealing to a larger swathe of people.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a golden opportunity with Donald Trump versus Joe Biden 2.0, voters are looking for something different, and in particular, they're looking for younger voices to rise up and really start speaking up in our political system,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the Libertarian Party is having an identity crisis, exacerbated by Oliver\u2019s own identity.\n\n\n\nDiffering visions on the party\u2019s future\n\nOliver is gay, and his support for gay rights \u2014 including issues that affect transgender people \u2014 has widened an existing rift within the party.\n\n\u201cI don't run as just the gay candidate, but it is certainly a part of my identity,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's something I am not ashamed of being. I'm proud of being who I am and living as my authentic self, and so I'm just hoping to inspire other people to live as their authentic selves.\u201d\n\ntoggle caption Stephen Fowler, NPR.\n\nAt the Portland, Maine pride festival earlier this month, Oliver took breaks from waving an American flag bedecked in marijuana leaves and rainbow stripes to hand out campaign literature, practice his stump speech and shoot the breeze on ballot access with a canvasser for a rival campaign.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cSo Maine and Alaska are two states where people don\u2019t have to fear the spoiler effect,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the reasons why I'm here in Maine and one of the reasons why I want to be going up to Alaska is to let voters know, \u2018Hey, you can put me first and don't worry about it, you put your lesser of two evils next.'\u201d\n\nBut some in the party see Oliver's viewpoints and selection as the nominee as the greater evil.\n\nOliver is a more traditional libertarian aligned with the Classical Liberal caucus, as it's known. There\u2019s a growing wing of the party \u2014 the Mises Caucus \u2014 that has decidedly non-Libertarian views on social and cultural issues.\n\nThe Mises Caucus is a more hardline, edgy and sometimes inflammatory take on libertarianism that is more compatible with the Republican Party under Trump \u2014 which is partly why the former president spoke at the party\u2019s convention this year.\n\nTrump suggested the Libertarian Party back his campaign, instead.\n\n\u201cYou know, only [back me] if you want to win,\u201d he said to boos and jeers from the audience. \u201cIf you want to lose, don't do that. Keep getting your 3% every four years.\u201d\n\ntoggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nBacking Oliver to help Trump\n\nHistorically, Libertarian candidates have pulled more voters from Republican candidates, though this time some are explicitly seeking the opposite.\n\nThat includes Libertarian Party Chair Angela McArdle, who has said explicitly she endorses Chase Oliver as a vehicle for Trump\u2019s victory.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump said he's going to put a libertarian in a cabinet position,\u201d she said in a recent social media livestream. \u201cHe came out and spoke to us. He said he's a libertarian. He has basically endorsed us. And so in return, I endorse Chase Oliver as the best way to beat Joe Biden.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nShe quipped: \"Get in, loser. We are stopping Biden.\u201d\n\nOliver remains an optimist, and amidst the vitriol is still convinced there\u2019s a pathway to reconciliation over a shared view of liberty.\n\nHe dismissed some of the homophobia and opposition to his campaign as \u201cloud voices\u201d in the Libertarian Party who aren\u2019t representative of the party\u2019s voters as a whole.\n\nOliver also declined to speak ill of the Mises Caucus or their beliefs.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I'm hoping to heal the divide in the party so that we can have more of them involved in this process of this campaign,\u201d he said contemplatively. \u201cI will continue to extend my hand, even if some people might want to smack it away. And I have to continue that work to try to heal the divide within our party.\u201d\n\nSo far, four state parties have publicly denounced Oliver\u2019s nomination to differing degrees: Montana, Colorado, New Hampshire and Idaho. In the swing states that will decide the election, though, and where margins really matter, he\u2019s their guy.",

planet\u2019 is at stake.\n\nWith climate change fuelling more extreme weather events around the world \u2014 from record wildfires to powerful hurricanes, floods, heatwaves and drought \u2014 United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres offered a dire warning.\n\n\u201cWe are playing Russian roulette with our planet,\u201d he told reporters on June 5. \u201cWe need an exit ramp off the highway to climate hell, and the truth is we have control of the wheel.\u201d\n\nYet, in the United States where Guterres delivered his remarks, the climate crisis has been largely sidelined in the lead-up to this year\u2019s presidential election.\n\nEnvironmental advocates have warned, however, that November\u2019s showdown between Democratic President Joe Biden and his Republican predecessor Donald Trump will not only affect climate policy in the US but around the world.\n\n\u201cThe US plays such an outsized role in both international politics and also greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d said Ariel Moger, the government and political affairs director at Friends of the Earth Action, a US-based climate justice group.\n\n\u201cIn many ways, I think the fate of our planet lies with the American voters\u201d, she told Al Jazeera, \u201cwhich may sound a bit hyperbolic, but I think that is the moment that we\u2019re living in\u201d.\n\nVoter priorities\n\nThe US is the world\u2019s second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases after China, and it produced an average of 12.9 million barrels of crude oil per day last year \u2014 breaking a previous global record from 2019.\n\nBut climate change has not been a major focus of the presidential election campaign so far, taking a backseat to economic issues, immigration and foreign policy.\n\nMoger explained that those concerns may seem more concrete, compared with an issue as large and wide-ranging as the climate crisis.\n\n\u201cClimate change is often viewed as an overwhelming, existential threat in a world where people are just trying to get through their day,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cMany issues like the economy, abortion access \u2014 these are things that people are dealing with more regularly, or the threat feels more real to them.\u201d\n\nStill, recent surveys show that a majority of Americans want their political leaders to address the climate crisis and that many prefer candidates who will enact policies to that effect.\n\nA report released last week by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and the Center for Climate Change Communication at George Mason University found that 62 percent of registered voters support candidates who pledge to take climate action.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s overwhelmingly true among Democrats, but it\u2019s also very true among independents and even half of liberal-moderate Republicans, which is about a third of the Republican Party,\u201d Anthony Leiserowitz, the director of the Yale University programme, told Al Jazeera.\n\nAbout four in 10 voters also said a presidential candidate\u2019s position on global warming would be \u201cvery important\u201d when deciding who to vote for in November, the report (PDF) found.\n\nStill, several surveys show that climate change is not at the top of most Americans\u2019 priorities: It falls far behind the economy, inflation and other topics voters said were more pressing.\n\nA Gallup poll in May, for example, found that only 2 percent of Americans said climate change was the most important problem facing the country, trailing economic issues (36 percent), government and poor leadership (21 percent) and immigration (17 percent).\n\nClimate change \u201cmakes the list, but it\u2019s not considered the most important issue\u201d, explained Ashley Dancer, a PhD student at the University of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder) who has studied how opinions on climate change affected the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s superseded by things like the economy, health care, education and crime \u2014 those kitchen-table issues.\u201d\n\nEffect on close race\n\nAs the US enters its summer season on Thursday, wildfires continue to rip through states such as California and New Mexico, and a heat dome has descended across much of the country.\n\nWith extreme weather events expected to continue through the summer, Moger said she expects climate change to take up more space in election-related discussions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen that, as more people suffer from record heat, drought, wildfires [and] hurricanes, the harder it is for candidates to ignore the reality of the crisis that is in front of us,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd in a close election \u2014 as November\u2019s contest is expected to be \u2014 climate change could also be a deciding factor, Dancer told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cWe know that now, most voters \u2014 which is about two-thirds \u2014 are concerned about climate change and want something done about it, and that this is increasing over time. These voters strongly prefer Democrats, and this preference is also increasing over time,\u201d she said.\n\nThat is because, in the US\u2019s two-party system, Democrats are viewed as more willing to acknowledge the dangers of climate change and address the problem, compared with their Republican counterparts.\n\nEnvironmental advocates also note the differences between Biden\u2019s and Trump\u2019s climate policies are stark.\n\nWhile in office, Trump withdrew from the Paris climate accord, the international agreement to cap greenhouse gas emissions. He also sought to open up vast tracts of US territory for oil and gas exploration.\n\nIn addition, he has regularly questioned whether climate change is real and downplayed its effects. And in a recent meeting with top US oil executives, Trump pledged to roll back some of Biden\u2019s environmental rules if re-elected, The Washington Post reported.\n\nFor his part, Biden has not gone as far as environmentalists would like in phasing out fossil fuels, and he was recently criticised for approving a contentious oil drilling project in Alaska last year.\n\nStill, he has regularly warned of the threat posed by climate change and urged global cooperation.\n\nHe rejoined the Paris climate deal in one of his first acts as president and enacted ambitious climate policies at home, including through the Inflation Reduction Act, which set emission reduction targets and allocated funds for the clean energy transition.\n\nIn a study released in January, Dancer and her colleagues found that the advantage that climate change provided to Democrats \u201cwas probably large enough in 2020 to change the outcome\u201d of the presidential race. Biden defeated Trump in 2020 after winning by small margins in key swing states.\n\nIf climate change had not been as much of a concern, the study projected that Republicans could have enjoyed a 3 percent swing in the overall popular vote \u2014 \u201ca shift [that] would probably have been pivotal\u201d in the results.\n\n\u201cIn a close election, climate change opinion matters,\u201d Dancer said. \u201cIt did play a role in the 2020 election, so it likely will in this one [in November]. Whether or not it tips the scale will be determined by how close the election ends up being.\u201d\n\nPolitical communication\n\nAccording to Leiserowitz at Yale University, it is also incumbent on politicians to effectively communicate their climate policies if they want to connect to potential voters.\n\nAs it stands, few Americans \u2014 including those who care about the issue and make up the Democratic Party\u2019s base \u2014 know much about the Biden administration\u2019s positions, he explained.\n\nNearly four in 10 registered voters said they had heard \u201cnothing at all\u201d about the Inflation Reduction Act, for instance, according to last week\u2019s report from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an indication that, at least up to this point, [Democrats] have not adequately communicated their success to the American people,\u201d Leiserowitz said.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t communicate it, the vast majority of people are never going to hear about it, and they\u2019re never going to connect the dots themselves. It\u2019s just not true that policy is going to sell itself, and then you will reap the political rewards.\u201d\n\nMoger also noted that, while climate action \u201cis extremely popular\u201d and key constituencies \u2014 including young people and progressives \u2014 care about the issue deeply, voter turnout will be key.\n\n\u201cBiden still has time to \u2026 take some significant steps in terms of climate action,\u201d Moger said. She called the Democratic president \u201cfar from perfect\u201d but warned that another Trump term would spell climate disaster.\n\n\u201cWe know that, under a Trump presidency, we would be seeing more policies that would take us in the wrong direction and lead to ultimately an uninhabitable planet,\u201d Moger told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cIf [the US is] not leading by example, then the entire world will be suffering, not just in terms of policy but in terms of the amount of emissions that we\u2019ll continue to be polluting.\u201d",

        "text": "Event Recap: 2024 Election Insights\nElections inevitably come with uncertainty. As candidates express differing visions for the direction the country will take, it\u2019s only natural to be concerned about how the outcome could affect different aspects of life for you and your family \u2013 and that includes your finances and investments.\n\nWith the 2024 presidential campaign heating up, J.P. Morgan Wealth Management presented a webcast on May 9 about the possible financial impacts of the election. Moderator Shelby Anderson, Executive Director of J.P. Morgan Wealth Management Wealth Planning & Advice, spoke with Shawn Snyder, Executive Director and Global Investment Strategist at J.P. Morgan, on a range of topics \u2013 from the historical performance of the markets around election time to the potential tax and investment implications of this year\u2019s contest.\n\nThe speakers suggested that, although elections can be stressful, you\u2019ll probably be better off if you avoid any overreactions when it comes to your financial strategy. But even if election season is no reason to panic, it\u2019s important to be aware of how the results at the ballot box could impact your wallet and your portfolio. Here are some highlights from the webcast to help you understand the possible financial repercussions of the 2024 election.\n\nStock market performance around the election\n\nThere may be some misconceptions about how financial markets react to presidential races. During the webcast, Snyder addressed the \u201cfrequent belief that if candidate so and so wins, the stock market is going to crash.\u201d Despite the political passion behind the idea, this scenario has never really played out.\n\nIn fact, if you\u2019ve heard that markets hate uncertainty, it may come as no surprise that stocks tend to rally after the election as uncertainty dissipates. When post-election downturns do hit the markets, it is often a symptom of the wider economic backdrop rather than an identifiable unfavorable market reaction to the newly elected president.\n\nSector impacts\n\nThis is not to say that the winner of the race to the White House has zero influence over the performance of the stock market. Of course, presidential policies and decisions can shape the economy on many levels. For stock investors, election impact tends to be felt most at the sector level.\n\nThe general tendency is for financial stocks to outperform ahead of elections, with an expectation that whoever becomes president will try to bolster growth with new policy initiatives. Health care tends to do better under Democrats, while energy may be boosted under Republican leadership.\n\nThe 2024 campaign is a rare case in that the presumptive nominees from both major parties have been president before. This provides us with a historical reference of what happened in the markets when they took over the Oval Office.\n\nFinancials, industrials, and aerospace and defense stocks did well after Donald Trump won the election in 2016, while infrastructure stocks outperformed following Joe Biden\u2019s victory in 2020. The post-election stock market gains were stronger in 2020, but that also coincided with positive vaccine news, demonstrating once again that factors beyond the election results can influence the markets.\n\nWhile the familiar faces and our knowledge of what happened after the past two elections give us some hints about what we might expect this time around, there is no guarantee that the same developments will repeat in 2024.\n\nTax implications\n\nRegardless of who wins the presidency this year, many provisions from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 are set to expire in 2025. This means lawmakers will have to decide on how to tackle changes to the tax code, striking a balance between even higher national debt and raising taxes. Expiration of the 2017 tax law would lead to higher taxes for most U.S. households.\n\nOf course, the shape of the tax code moving forward depends not only on the outcome of the presidential election but also on congressional results. Party control over the House and the Senate remains uncertain, and it\u2019s even possible that both chambers could switch hands following the 2024 election.\n\nRepublicans may support extending the tax cuts and propose major cuts to nondefense spending, while Democrats could favor tax hikes on corporations and wealthier individuals. However, given the likelihood of a divided government, both parties may have to compromise \u2013 perhaps leaving taxes slightly higher but with little deficit reduction.\n\nOther policy outcomes\n\nTariffs are another area where the major presidential candidates hold different opinions and viewpoints. Trump favors a 10% tariff on all goods imported into the U.S. and a 60% tariff on all imports from China, whereas Biden plans to reassess tariffs but recently announced his own tough stance on China, levying significant tariffs on imports from the country including steel, semiconductors and electric vehicles. Tariffs can affect economic growth and may benefit or harm particular sectors or companies.\n\nThe candidates also have distinct viewpoints on climate and energy policy. A second Trump administration would aim to increase energy production by drilling on federal land and extending pipelines, whereas Biden would aim to reduce emissions and increase energy efficiency.\n\nIncreased production and targeted deregulation under Trump could benefit some companies in the energy sector, but greater energy supply could also lead to lower prices, so the benefits for oil and gas stocks may not be as pronounced as some might expect. Meanwhile, if Biden remains in the White House, assets linked to renewable energy might find more support, but traditional oil and gas companies could come under pressure.\n\nAlthough Trump and Biden have diverging priorities when it comes to geopolitical and domestic security views, defense spending is likely to remain robust under either candidate.\n\nBottom line\n\nWhile there is a lot on the line in the upcoming election \u2013 including potential impacts on your money \u2013 the bottom line is that election outcomes have not driven market outcomes over the long term. There may be volatility leading up to Election Day, but there is no evidence of a clear, long-term impact on the markets or the economy.\n\nWith that in mind, it\u2019s important to be aware of the election\u2019s potential effects so that you can adjust your investing and financial strategies accordingly, but you shouldn\u2019t let your stress or excitement about the political landscape interfere with your long-term financial strategy.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let that emotion get the best of you,\u201d Anderson advised during the webcast. \u201cYou know, make sure that you are creating a plan \u2013 that you are revisiting it often, or periodically, especially as life circumstances change \u2013 but not letting the emotion in what can seem like a very stressful time leading up to elections really drive our decision making.\u201d",

        "text": "Biden and Trump will face each other at next week\u2019s debate. They are preparing much differently\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden begins an intense period of private preparations Friday at Camp David for what may be the most consequential presidential debate in decades.\n\nThe 81-year-old Democrat\u2019s team is aware he cannot afford an underwhelming performance when he faces Republican rival Donald Trump for 90 minutes on live television June 27. Biden\u2019s team expects aggressive attacks on his physical and mental strength, his record on the economy and immigration and even his family.\n\nREAD MORE: RFK Jr. fails to qualify for CNN\u2019s debate, setting up showdown between Biden and Trump\n\nTrump, 78 and ever confident, will stay on the campaign trail before going to his Florida estate next week for two days of private meetings as part of an informal prep process.\n\nThe ex-president\u2019s allies are pushing him to stay focused on his governing plans but expect him to be tested by pointed questions about his unrelenting focus on election fraud, his role in the erosion of abortion rights and his unprecedented legal baggage.\n\nThe CNN debate will be full of firsts, with the potential to reshape the presidential race. Never before in the modern era have two presumptive nominees met on the debate stage so early in the general election season. Never before have two White House contenders faced off at such advanced ages, with widespread questions about their readiness.\n\nAnd never before has a general election debate participant been saddled with a felony conviction. The debate stage meeting comes just two weeks before Trump is scheduled to be sentenced on 34 felony counts in his New York hush money trial.\n\n\u201cYou can argue this will be the most important debate, at least in my lifetime,\u201d said Democratic strategist Jim Messina, a 54-year-old who managed President Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign.\n\nPressure on Biden\n\nThe ground rules for the June 27 debate, the first of two scheduled meetings, are unusual.\n\nThe candidates agreed to meet at a CNN studio in Atlanta with no audience. Each candidate\u2019s microphone will be muted, except when it\u2019s his turn to speak. No props or prewritten notes will be allowed onstage. The candidates will be given only a pen, a pad of paper and a bottle of water.\n\nThere will be no opening statements. A coin flip determined Biden would stand at the podium to the viewer\u2019s right, while Trump would deliver the final closing statement.\n\nThe next debate won\u2019t be until September. Any stumbles June 27 will be hard to erase or replace quickly.\n\nBiden arrived at Camp David on Thursday night and is expected to hunker down with senior campaign aides until the debate. While traveling to the mountainside retreat, he gave a thumbs up to reporters when asked how debate prep was going.\n\nThe president\u2019s aides have been reluctant to share details about his preparations, run by former chief of staff Ron Klain. But they\u2019ve signaled he\u2019s preparing to be aggressive and wouldn\u2019t shy away from using the term \u201cconvicted felon\u201d to describe his opponent.\n\nWATCH: Capehart and Johnson on how the Biden-Trump debates could shape the campaign season\n\nOne adviser not authorized to speak publicly about debate strategy noted Biden has been increasingly punchier in recent remarks about Trump and plans to carry that theme through to the debate. That\u2019s still while trying to project himself as \u201cthe wise and steady leader\u201d in contrast with Trump, the adviser said.\n\nAmong some political operatives, there\u2019s the sense Biden may have more to lose given his struggle to generate momentum amid signs of weakness within his political coalition. Trump and his allies have set an extraordinarily low bar, however, by suggesting for months Biden is contending with serious physical limitations that make it difficult for him to stand for 90 minutes or string together two sentences.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the mirror test. Put a mirror under Biden\u2019s nose, and if it fogs it up, he wins, right? That\u2019s about what the threshold is for Biden,\u201d Republican strategist and Trump ally David Urban said with a laugh. \u201cCan Biden demonstrate that he\u2019s mentally nimble? That\u2019s the big question.\u201d\n\nYet Trump sought to shift expectations in a Thursday interview with the \u201cThe All-In Podcast\u201d in which he veered sharply away from his typical Biden taunts. He said Biden \u201cdestroyed\u201d vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan in their 2012 debate.\n\n\u201cI assume he\u2019s going to be somebody that will be a worthy debater,\u201d Trump said of Biden. \u201cI don\u2019t want to underestimate him.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s aides have dismissed concerns about his age and mental readiness. They\u2019re fighting against what they allege is deceptive editing of video clips to suggest he\u2019s confused.\n\nBut while some Democrats project confidence, Biden\u2019s allies also say he has spent much of the last two weeks traveling \u2014 in Europe and on the West Coast \u2014 limiting his ability to prepare. Others note incumbent presidents typically struggle in the season\u2019s opening general election debate.\n\nMessina made both points even as he sought to play up the political stakes for Trump. He suggested Trump was taking an unnecessary political risk by debating Biden, given Trump\u2019s early advantage in many polls.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have done the debate if I was him,\u201d Messina said of Trump. \u201cIf you\u2019re tied or a little bit ahead of the incumbent, why would you want to give him this air? He decided he wanted to do this to knock him out, and if he doesn\u2019t, then I think he\u2019s in real trouble.\u201d\n\nTrump projecting confidence\n\nTrump\u2019s team sees the faceoff as an opportunity to demonstrate a clear contrast with Biden\u2019s leadership ability and governing record.\n\nAnd while downplaying his preparations, Trump aides have a pattern of insisting he doesn\u2019t prepare for debates when, in fact, he does \u2014 in his own way. Instead of mock debates with lecterns and stand-ins or hours spent poring over policy books, the ex-president is expected to rely on a series of conversations about policy and strategy with aides and political allies.\n\nTrump will also make public appearances over the coming days.\n\nOn Saturday, he\u2019s set to host a rally in Philadelphia and deliver a keynote address to a conference of Christian conservatives in Washington. He also has a fundraiser in New Orleans on Monday before going to his Florida estate for meetings.\n\n\u201cBiden needs rehearsals with handlers to find some way to explain this mess he\u2019s made of our nation,\u201d Trump spokesman Brian Hughes said. \u201cPresident Trump is always prepared to present to Americans his record of success and Biden\u2019s weakness and failures.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s camp is aware Trump will likely focus on his son Hunter, as the then-president did on the debate stage four years ago. Hunter Biden was recently convicted on three felony charges related to the purchase of a gun while allegedly being addicted to drugs.\n\nRepublicans have also criticized Hunter Biden\u2019s foreign business dealings when Joe Biden was vice president.\n\nBiden\u2019s allies are also concerned, however, their famously combative rival might be on good behavior.\n\n\u201cFor both campaigns, the goal here is reaching an audience of moderate, independent, swing voters in swing states who will, in many ways, be the deciding factor in this election,\u201d said former Biden administration official Bill Russo.\n\n\u201cTrump has kind of a golden opportunity here. If he can pretend that he\u2019s a reasonable human being for 90 minutes while he\u2019s in the spotlight, he\u2019s got a lot to gain,\u201d Russo added. \u201cThe real key here is which Trump shows up.\u201d\n\nAssociated Press writers Michelle L.

        "text": "There are several Iranian presidential candidates, but only one Khamenei might want\nThe June 28 presidential election in Iran will be the first of its kind. Since the 1988 constitutional reforms that abolished the prime minister\u2019s office and elevated the presidency, this is the first time that the Islamic Republic is holding an election ahead of schedule.\n\nThere have been two key trends in the Islamic Republic\u2019s elections. Inside Iran, one is known as shol kon, seft kon (loosen, tighten). It refers to eight-year intervals of conservative administration followed by eight years of a reformist or pragmatist one. For eight years, the regime increases domestic oppression and hostility toward the free world to rally its conservative base. For the next eight years, marginal social freedoms would give hope for gradual reform, and rhetorical softening of foreign policy would release foreign pressure, through sanctions relief. Until recently, this policy recovered the political capital the regime had spent at home and abroad during the previous eight years of conservative administrations.\n\nThis has been the norm since Ayatollah Ali Khamenei became the supreme leader, with conservative Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani (1989-1997) followed by reformist Mohammad Khatami (1997-2005), conservative Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (2005-2013), pragmatist Hassan Rouhani (2013-2021), and conservative Ebrahim Raisi (2021-2024).\n\nSIGN UP FOR THIS WEEK IN THE MIDEAST NEWSLETTER\n\nRaisi\u2019s sudden death in a helicopter crash nearly three years into the job broke this trend. On the other hand, the Islamic Republic feels less of a need to play the same game. Domestically, reformists and moderates cannot rally the people any longer. On the international stage, it\u2019s well-known that the presidency is not a policymaking office. Also, Democratic US administrations give the regime breathing room even if there is a conservative in office\u2014the nuclear negotiations began when Barack Obama and Ahmadinejad were in office in March 2013\u2014and Republicans will increase pressure even if a moderate governs\u2014the Donald Trump administration\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d strategy began under Rouhani\u2019s presidency in 2018.\n\nThe second trend has been that known commodities never get the presidential job. The last president widely known inside and outside Iran was Rafsanjani, who was a prominent revolutionary and the commander in chief of the armed forces during the Iran\u2013Iraq War. Khatami, Ahmadinejad, Rouhani, and Raisi became famous after running for president. The Islamic Republic limits presidents to two consecutive terms. Rafsanjani made two further attempts, but both failed\u2014he lost in 2005, likely because of election fraud, and was disqualified during his 2013 run. Reformist Mir Hossein Mousavi, a former prime minister and already a prominent figure, was also cheated out of office during the 2009 election, which prompted the post-election protests known as the Green Movement.\n\nKhamenei worries that established figures can create movements within the regime structure that, combined with their knowledge of how the system works, can challenge him. Therefore, he has preferred unknown, uncharismatic figures, especially when it comes to reformists. Indeed, Ahmadinejad proved to be a formidable foe who freelanced too much. This was due, in part, to the fraudulent outcome of the 2009 election and the subsequent Green Movement. The widespread protests rallied the regime\u2019s base behind Ahmadinejad as almost a martyr, metaphorically speaking. This elevated his stature to unprecedented heights and provided him with immunity from Khamenei\u2019s wrath, which protects him to this day.\n\nThe president\u2019s function\n\nElected offices in the Islamic Republic could be compared to the US civil service. In Iran, things are upside down. The policymaking class is unelected and forms the permanent state, while bureaucrats run in elections to implement this permanent state\u2019s policies. Khatami once described his office as \u201cthe system\u2019s footman.\u201d Like all bureaucrats, elected officials can cause headaches for the policymakers through incompetence or mischief. Presidents can also use their bully pulpit to promote a cause. In Ahmadinejad\u2019s case, that cause was himself, a mistake that can never be repeated in Khamenei\u2019s eyes.\n\nKhamenei needs an economic manager to address the economic crisis that ails the Islamic Republic. Khamenei\u2019s hand is relatively light in economics. Sanctions have taught him that he needs self-sufficiency, or economic nationalism, wherein everything is produced at home and science and research are elevated, a concept he termed a \u201cresistance economy.\u201d He also ensures wealth is distributed among all important regime subsidiaries\u2014particularly the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Beyond that, he leaves the details to his elected bureaucrats to figure out. More than ever, Khamenei needs a president who executes this imperative. Whether this is possible is a different question, but Raisi failed to satisfy the need.\n\nPerhaps more than competence, Khamenei needs someone to rally his conservative base. Economic indicators, support for the system, confidence in institutions, and all other measurable and immeasurable political values in Iran are in decline. The supreme leader is not someone who fires up the base. He needs a president who can boost morale among the hardliner youth and motivate them ideologically to beat up protesters in the streets and fight in Syria and Iraq\u2014and elsewhere if Iran expands its direct presence.\n\nConsidering these different trends and necessities, the six approved candidates require further scrutiny.\n\nThe only reformist among the six candidates is the amusingly named Masoud Pezeshkian\u2014his last name means \u201cof physician lineage,\u201d and he lives up to his name as a surgeon and former health minister. Pezeshkian was Khatami\u2019s health minister during his second term and has been a member of parliament since 2008. While there once were sincere reformists in Iran, many rounds of purges and eliminations have left only the insincere and slavish ones in office, including Pezeshkian. However, he checks an essential box for Khamenei: he has no charisma, popular base, or following within the regime structure. His competence and economic management are untested, but he will not rally any base for anyone. That Khamenei has yet to send a signal of support to rally the security forces behind a conservative is potentially a tacit sign that he favors Pezeshkian.\n\nThe second category of candidates is the fringe conservative. Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi is one of the dozen vice presidents\u2014better described as deputy presidents\u2014and oversees the Foundation of Martyrs and Veterans portfolio. It is a fairly obscure position that oversees benefits for veterans and the families of war casualties. Despite its obscurity, this is an important position. The beneficiaries have been the regime\u2019s foot soldiers, on whose shoulders it has stood for decades, but they are increasingly abandoning the regime. In his current role, Ghazizadeh Hashemi is tasked with using ideological and financial incentives to mobilize veterans. With his experience as the incumbent food distributor among the regime\u2019s base, combined with his hardline politics, Ghazizadeh Hashemi could be the wildcard in this race for his capacity to rally support.\n\nTehran Mayor Alireza Zakani is the other member of the fringe-conservative category and a former member of parliament. He has a low profile and provides no value to Khamenei\u2019s needs. Zakani is the typical supporting character who will be forgotten as a candidate, so a detailed look is unnecessary.\n\nThe last category is the known conservative. Mohammad Baqer Ghalibaf is a former IRGC unit commander and mayor of Tehran, and is currently the speaker of parliament. He is always a feature of presidential elections, but never a threat. He is also uncharismatic and not particularly popular among the regime\u2019s base. Ghalibaf\u2019s extreme corruption came to light in recent years, which makes him unappealing among the regime\u2019s populist base. But he clears one box: loyalty to Khamenei. He could even be credibly accused of competence, which the regime needs in a president more than ever. But he has been around for too long and is a known commodity\u2014not something Khamenei typically wants. If Khamenei opts to support him, it will be due to the extraordinary circumstances under which this election is being held, and the fact that there has not been enough time to choose and elevate a lesser-known figure.\n\nSaeed Jalili is the other member of the known-conservative category. A war veteran with a missing leg, and as ideologically rigid as they come, he has the bragging right that he did not give an inch when he was the nuclear negotiator. The base loves him already, but he is the one candidate who could be another Ahmadinejad. It is also a problem that his ideological rigidity comes at the cost of competence. His understanding of politics could be summarized as, \u201cEverything will work out if people pray harder and believe more in the system.\u201d Unlike Raisi, who had the wisdom to avoid fiery statements about foreign matters, Jalili carries the risk of public remarks that would jeopardize the current loosening of sanctions. Like Ahmadinejad, he is a candidate who comes with significant risks but potentially big rewards.\n\nThe last candidate is Mostafa Pourmohammadi. Raisi was infamous for the 1988 massacre of political prisoners, and Pourmohammadi was a key actor in it. Though Raisi kept somewhat of a low profile after 1988 until he ran for president in 2017, Pourmohammadi has been a feature of every oppression campaign as a member of the security apparatus with close ties to the IRGC. As Ahmadinejad\u2019s interior minister responsible for law enforcement, he set up the morality police and enforced an extreme religious code in public, and occasionally in private. Ahmadinejad sacked him in 2008 for being Khamenei\u2019s mole in his cabinet. He returned to the security apparatus and played a leading role in cracking down on the 2009 protests. As Rouhani\u2019s justice minister, he oversaw a spike in executions. He might prove to be a better economic manager than Raisi, can rally the base, and is not a risk to abuse the bully pulpit against Khamenei or sabotage sanctions relief.\n\nPourmohammadi is the ideal candidate except for two issues. First, he is a known commodity, which Khamenei does not like. He has been a prominent figure within the system and is shrewd enough to get his way. Second, he is the only cleric in the field. So far, Khamenei\u2019s only civilian president has been Ahmadinejad, which gives Pourmohammadi another advantage. However, a hardliner cleric could immediately become a contender for supreme leadership, which might raise objections from Khamenei\u2019s son, Mojtaba, who is allegedly gearing up for the position.\n\nPourmohammadi\u2019s work at the security apparatus in intelligence, secret-police, law-enforcement, and prosecution capacities means that he is in a perfect position to challenge Khamenei from within, but this does not mean that he will. Unlike Ahmadinejad, the cautionary tale, Pourmohammadi has known Khamenei since the 1980s. This could mean that the supreme leader knows the candidate enough to trust him\u2014or enough not to. But if the elder Khamenei finds him trustworthy, Pourmohammadi is his ideal president, even though the younger Khamenei might object.\n\nThe question of Iran\u2019s next president has swung from one misunderstanding to another in Washington. Once upon a time, Americans hoped that a new president would effect reform and change. Now, they ignore elections as entirely irrelevant.\n\nThe president of Iran matters in two ways. First, like the US civil service, the Islamic Republic\u2019s administrations cannot make policies, but they have nontrivial influence in implementing them. Whether due to incompetence, disagreement, or corruption, the president can become an obstacle to the permanent state. Second, who Khamenei wants to become president tells us about the internal state of the system and what Khamenei believes to be his regime\u2019s vulnerabilities for a new president to address.\n\nMany crises consume the Islamic Republic, and most of these candidates are a patch for some of these problems. Whoever becomes president will be a hint as to which of these crises Khamenei believes to be the most urgent. It also will tell us where he wants to take Iran next.\n\nShay Khatiri is the vice president of development and a senior fellow at the Yorktown Institute.\n\nFurther reading\n\nImage: Iranian presidential candidate Mostafa Pourmohammadi attends an election debate at a television studio in Tehran, Iran June 20, 2024.

Has conviction dented Trump's edge?\nTrump leads Biden in 7 swing states\n\nEmerson College and The Hill survey\n\nTrump's lead widens after conviction\n\nFAQs:\n\n\n\n\n\n(You can now subscribe to our\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel\n\nAt a time when Donald Trump is facing a jail term in the hush money case , he remains more popular than his rival Joe Biden . Though inflation and unemployment remain the key factors, he maintains an edge over the president in seven swing states . A new survey held six months before the 2024 US Presidential Election shows that the former president will beat the incumbent if elections are held today. According to the Ipsos poll data released Thursday, Trump will beat Biden 37% to 35% overall in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. These are swing states. A swing state is a state that could reasonably be won by either the Democratic or Republican candidate in a statewide election or residential election, by a swing in votes.'Forbes' has reported that in a two-way race, Trump leads Biden by seven points in the Southeastern states of Georgia and North Carolina and by 10 points in the Midwestern states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. But the GOP contender trails Biden by 12 points in the Southwestern states of Arizona and Nevada. According to Real Clear Politics polling averages, Trump leads Biden in all seven states.In another poll conducted by Emerson College and The Hill, it has been found that Trump has an edge over Biden in Arizona (47%-43%), Georgia (45%-41%), Michigan (46%-45%), Nevada (46%-43%), Pennsylvania (47%-45%), and Wisconsin (47%-44%). Interestingly in all these six states, Trump's lead has either remained the same or grown after he was convicted by a Manhattan jury on 34 felony charges.The survey also shows that Trump and Biden hold 45% each in Minnesota, which has voted for a Republican candidate for president just three times since the Great Depression. However, Trump's support among independent voters has come down in all these states.Trump\u2019s support among independent voters came down five points, from 48% to 43%, in Michigan, his support dropped three points, from 44% to 41%, and in Pennsylvania, Trump dropped eight points, from 49% to 41%. On the other hand, Biden lost support among independents in Georgia, by six points, 42% to 36% and Nevada, by five, 37% to 32%.\u201dA new survey held six months before the 2024 US Presidential Election shows that the former president will beat the incumbent if elections are held today.A swing state is a state that could reasonably be won by either the Democratic or Republican candidate in a statewide election or presidential election, by a swing in votes.",

        "text": "Election 2024: Will Next Week\u2019s Debate Shake Up the Presidential Race?\nPolitical aficionados longing to move past an anti-climactic nominating season will soon get their wish. Unless something unexpected happens, President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump will square off in a debate hosted by CNN next Thursday night. Both campaigns hope that the ninety-minute faceoff will turn Election 2024 decisively in their favor.\n\nHow much any presidential debate matters to the outcome in November is a matter of conjecture. U.S. history is replete with debates that seemed in the heat of the moment to have changed the tide but ultimately didn\u2019t. Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama each famously flopped in their first debates when they sought reelection. Both men then went on to resounding victories.\n\nHow candidates perform on the debate stage would seem to matter most in tight races. That was the case in the three elections typically held up as examples of where debates determined the outcome: the Kennedy-Nixon debate in 1960, the Ford-Carter debate in 1976, and the Carter-Reagan debate in 1980. The first is remembered for Richard Nixon\u2019s five o\u2019clock shadow, the second for Gerald Ford insisting the Soviet Union wasn\u2019t dominating Eastern Europe, and the third for Ronald Reagan assuring viewers that he was reasonable rather than reckless.\n\nThe Water's Edge James M.

But one difference sets it apart from past presidential debates: It is not being held weeks before Election Day but rather months. That will give both campaigns plenty of time, even with early voting starting in some states in late September, to clean up their candidate\u2019s mistakes and to pound their opponents.\n\nBiden and Trump, of course, want to avoid mistakes. To that end, Biden is headed off to Camp David this weekend for intensive debate prep. The Biden team\u2019s messages to press on background is that the president will try to use Thursday\u2019s debate to \u201cremind tuned-out Americans of the former president\u2019s many controversies.\u201d In doing so, Biden will be trying to get into \u201ccampaign shape\u201d and to avoid repeating Reagan\u2019s and Obama\u2019s overconfidence.\n\nTrump is taking a different approach to preparing for next Thursday. Rather than holing up with trusted advisers to pore over briefing books, he has been on the phone with a range of advisers and holding rallies for his supporters. The Trump team\u2019s message is that the forty-fifth president doesn\u2019t need to be \u201ccoached up\u201d by subject-matter experts. Rallies and phone calls are all he needs to prepare.\n\nOne wild card for the debate is whether the U.S. Supreme Court will release its decision on Trump\u2019s claim that he is immune from criminal prosecution for all actions he took as president. The Court\u2019s annual session ends next Friday, and it has yet to issue its ruling. It may wait until Friday to hand down its decision to avoid charges it is trying to influence the debate. But if it releases a ruling before then, the moderators\u2014CNN anchors Dana Bash and Jake Tapper\u2014will have a whole new line of questions for both candidates.\n\nA wild card in all this is the debate\u2019s structure. There will be no audience. So Bash and Tapper won\u2019t be repeatedly asking people to quiet down. Neither Biden nor Trump will be allowed to bring props onstage, though they will be allowed a pen, a pad of paper, and a bottle of water. Both candidates will stand at a podium, and there will be one commercial break. Perhaps most consequentially, CNN will mute each candidate\u2019s microphone when their time is up. So the crosstalk that dominates\u2014and frequently undermines\u2014most debates should diminish.\n\nPundits will be parsing what Biden and Trump say in Atlanta. But as the Kennedy-Nixon debate illustrates, the debate could matter less for what either candidate says and more for how they appear or behave. Both campaign teams and their surrogates will be working the \u201cspin room\u201d onsite, and the multitude of cable and local news channels, to drive home a narrative that favors their candidate.\n\nPerhaps as consequential will be the debate clips that go viral on social media. George H.W. Bush came to rue checking his watch during his 1992 debate with Bill Clinton and Ross Perot. That was long before Facebook and Twitter were a gleam in anyone\u2019s eye. Now a faux pas can be watched and rewatched around the world before a debate even finishes.\n\nAn added worry is that a harmless moment can be turned by critics into a harmful one. The deceptively edited videos circulated last week purporting to show Biden wandering off during the G-7 summit show how a debate debacle can be conjured out of thin air even without resorting to AI and deepfakes. Such videos seem to be catnip on social media, where nearly one-third of Americans say they get their news. Many of them are what political strategists like to call \u201clow-information voters\u201d easily swayed by what they see because they know so little.\n\nSo, yes, a lot is at stake next Thursday, possibly including the outcome of the election.\n\nCampaign Update\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. failed to qualify for the June 27 debate. He did not meet either of CNN\u2019s criteria to be added to the debate stage: reaching at least 15 percent in four national polls and qualifying for enough state ballots to have the potential to win 270 Electoral College votes. Kennedy blamed his exclusion on his opponents: \u201cMy exclusion by Presidents Biden and Trump from the debate is undemocratic, un-American, and cowardly. Americans want an independent leader who will break apart the two-party duopoly.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s conviction last month on thirty-four felony counts may have been bad for him personally, but it did wonders for his fundraising. The latest Federal Election Committee numbers show Trump and the Republican National Committee raised $141 million in May. That\u2019s $60 million more than Biden and the Democratic National Committee raised. One donor gave Trump $50 million. The old saying that \u201cmoney is the mother\u2019s milk of politics\u201d comes to mind.\n\nWhat the Candidates Are Saying\n\nTrump pledged at a rally in Detroit last Saturday to cut U.S. aid to Ukraine. After calling the Ukrainian President \u201cthe greatest salesman of all time\u201d for his ability to persuade the United States to send military aid to Kyiv, Trump went on to claim that when it comes to the war in Ukraine, \u201cI will have that settled prior to taking the White House as president-elect.\u201d The former president seemed unaware that by both law and custom a president-elect should wait until taking the oath of office to begin negotiating with anyone.\n\nBiden announced a new policy on Tuesday that would enable immigrants who have been in the United States for at least a decade and are married to a U.S. citizen to apply for citizenship without first having to leave the country. U.S. policy had previously required such individuals to leave the United States before their spouse could sponsor them for a green card. The problem was, they had no guarantee they would be allowed to return. As a result, few people took that gamble to get citizenship. Biden administration officials say that the policy change will create a path to citizenship for half a million people.\n\nTrump issued a statement denouncing Biden\u2019s decision: \u201cBiden only cares about one thing\u2014power\u2014and that\u2019s why he is giving mass amnesty and citizenship to hundreds of thousands of illegals who he knows will ultimately vote for him and the Open Border Democrat Party.\u201d\n\nTrump said this week that he favored giving foreign students who graduate from U.S. colleges and universities the opportunity to become U.S. citizens. He told the All-In podcast: \u201cYou graduate from a college, I think you should get automatically as part of your diploma a green card to be able to stay in this country, and that includes junior colleges too.\u201d Trump did not pursue that idea when he was president. Rather, his administration was often hostile to legal immigration.\n\nWhat the Pundits Are Saying\n\nThe latest issue of Foreign Affairs has separate essays making the case for Biden\u2019s and Trump\u2019s foreign policies. Ben Rhodes, a deputy national security advisor under President Barack Obama, made the case for Biden. While gently criticizing Biden\u2019s \u201crestorationist\u201d foreign policy for failing to fully acknowledge that \u201cthe old rules-based international order doesn\u2019t really exist anymore,\u201d Rhodes argued that \u201cin its more affirmative agenda, the Biden administration is repositioning the United States for a changing world by focusing on the resilience of its own democracy and economy while rebooting alliances in Europe and Asia. To extend that regeneration into something more global and lasting, it should abandon the pursuit of primacy while embracing an agenda that can resonate with more of the world\u2019s governments and people.\u201d\n\nRobert O\u2019Brien, Trump\u2019s national security advisor from September 2019 through the end of his term, made the case for a second term Trump foreign policy. He portrayed Trump\u2019s four years in office as an unbroken string of successes in which \u201cTrump recognize[d] that a successful foreign policy requires joining forces with friendly governments and people elsewhere.\u201d (That characterization is debatable, to say the least.) O\u2019Brien predicted that \u201ca second Trump term would see the return of realism with a Jacksonian flavor. Washington\u2019s friends would be more secure and more self-reliant, and its foes would once again fear American power. The United States would be strong, and there would be peace.\u201d\n\nMike Levine of ABC News wrote that Kennedy is telling voters that the Central Intelligence Agency now controls major U.S. media outlets. Earlier this spring, Kennedy alleged that \u201cthe new head of NPR is a CIA agent.\u201d Levine argued that \u201cKennedy continues to amplify such claims at campaign events, in media interviews, and on social media, supporting them with what experts described to ABC News as \u2018half-truths,\u2019 \u2018intimations,\u2019 misinterpretations of law, and twisted historical anecdotes. He often cites widespread\u2014but utterly unsubstantiated\u2014allegations that a CIA program supposedly called \u2018Operation Mockingbird\u2019 secretly recruited journalists decades ago to help brainwash Americans.\u201d\n\nPolitico reported today that Washington and Seoul have begun talks a year early over Seoul\u2019s financial support for U.S. military bases in South Korea. The goal is to \u201cTrump-proof\u201d the alliance, at least in the short-term. During his time in office, Trump pressed South Korea for a more than five-fold increase in so-called host-country support, a demand that strained the alliance. The current Special Measures Agreement governing South Korea\u2019s support for U.S. military bases expires at the end of 2025. However, Seoul\u2019s effort to speed up negotiations \u201crisks reprisals if Donald Trump wins in November. They could include punitive financial burdens for South Korea that strain ties between Seoul and Washington amid rising regional tensions with both China and North Korea.\u201d\n\nWhat the Polls Show\n\nA poll commissioned by the Ronald Reagan Institute found rising public support for U.S. engagement in the world. The institute\u2019s poll last November found that just 42 percent of Americans favored greater U.S. engagement in the world. That number is now 54 percent. The poll\u2019s partisan split was relatively small. Two-thirds of Democrats favor great engagement, as do a near majority of Republicans (49 percent). Six in ten Americans polled had a favorable view of NATO.\n\nNational polling looks to have become friendlier to Biden. FiveThirtyEight reported today that for the first time this year that Biden leads Trump in its average of national polls. The margin is slight, 40.7 percent to 40.4 percent, with Kennedy drawing nearly 10 percent support. All the standard caveats apply about margins of error and the fact that presidents aren\u2019t chosen in a national vote but in the aggregation of votes in fifty states and one district.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Democratic-friendly polls that are showing a shift toward Biden. A Fox News poll released this week found that Biden has pulled ahead of Trump in its national poll of registered voters. Biden\u2019s 50-48 lead is the first time he has surpassed Trump in a Fox News poll since last October. Biden\u2019s lead fell to one point, 43-42, when Kennedy is added to the mix. These numbers are all within the poll\u2019s margin of error. Fox News attributes the shift toward Biden to growing support among independent voters. One obvious limitation of the poll is that it spoke to registered voters rather than likely voters. The two groups aren\u2019t the same. As a result, the poll includes the views of respondents who won\u2019t be going to the polls, and hence, won\u2019t be directly deciding the election\u2019s outcome.\n\nThe Campaign Schedule\n\nThe first presidential debate is in six days (June 27, 2024).\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s sentencing hearing is in twenty days (July 11, 2024).\n\nThe Republican National Convention opens in Milwaukee in twenty-four days (July 15, 2024).\n\nThe Democratic National Convention opens in Chicago in fifty-nine days (August 19, 2024).\n\nThe second presidential debate is in eighty-one days (September 10, 2024)\n\nThe first in-person absentee voting in the nation begins in Minnesota and South Dakota in ninety-one days (September 20, 2024).\n\nElection Day is 137 days away.\n\nInauguration Day is 213 days away.\n\nShelby Sires assisted in the preparation of this post.\n\nThis publication is part of the Diamonstein-Spielvogel Project on the Future of Democracy.",

        "text": "US farmers turn towards Biden over Trump\u2019s past agricultural policies\nFor two decades, Christopher Gibbs, a row crop and cattle farmer in Shelby county, Ohio, was an ardent Republican party member.\n\nHe served as chair of his county\u2019s Republican party branch for seven years and when Donald Trump became the party\u2019s presidential candidate in 2016, Gibbs, like more than 80% of Shelby county voters, fell in line.\n\nBut in 2018, everything changed.\n\nWatching Trump stand alongside Vladimir Putin at a summit in Helsinki, in which the president sided with his Russian counterpart against US law enforcement agencies that had indicted Russian intelligence officers for interfering in the US election in 2016, Gibbs was aghast.\n\nThen, not long after, Trump began trade tariffs against many of the US\u2019s international allies.\n\n\u201cOur allies retaliated by going after our soft underbelly: our agriculture,\u201d Gibbs says. \u201cWhen China retaliated by no longer taking our soybeans, I lost 20% of the value of my crop overnight.\u201d\n\nGibbs is among a small but perhaps growing group of US farmers who fear that Trump\u2019s threats of renewed trade wars and immigrant deportations could ruin their businesses should he prevail in the November presidential election.\n\nToday, Gibbs is a fervent member of the Democratic party and last year went as far as becoming the chair of his county\u2019s branch.\n\n\u201cIn the Democratic party, not everybody gets their way, but everybody gets a voice,\u201d says Gibbs. \u201cIn the Republican party, there\u2019s just one voice.\u201d\n\nIn important farming states such as Iowa, debates have raged over how another Trump presidency could cost farmers dearly. During Trump\u2019s previous tariff campaign that began in 2018, many farmers in Michigan, an election swing state, railed against the former president\u2019s actions.\n\nView image in fullscreen Farmers drive tractors in an Iowa state fair parade on 9 August 2023 in Des Moines, Iowa. Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nBack then, the Trump administration attempted to ease the financial pain it inflicted upon the agriculture community and ensure farmers continue to vote for him by paying out $52bn in subsidies in 2020 alone.\n\nOn the campaign trail this year, Trump falsely claimed $28bn was extracted from China, when, in fact, the direct payments to farmers came from the US government via taxpayer money.\n\nWhile Joe Biden remains unpopular with farmers \u2013 Gibbs is among only 12% of US farmers who typically vote for candidates of the Democratic party \u2013 results from a host of 2022 midterm races suggest that at the state and local level, support for Democratic party candidates in rural America may be rebounding.\n\nModerate Democrats in swing states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Arizona, as well as Gibbs\u2019 Ohio outperformed Biden\u2019s 2020 presidential election figures by as much as 15%, according to analysis by Third Way, a pro-Democratic party thinktank.\n\nResearch shows that under the Biden administration, farming incomes have increased significantly, in large part due to government assistance and a post-pandemic bump in demand for agricultural products. What\u2019s more, polls suggest a large number of rural Americans may vote for third-party or write-in candidates in November, a prospect that would hurt Trump more than Biden.\n\nGibbs isn\u2019t alone.\n\nSteve Held, whose family has ranched in eastern Montana since the 1800s, says he\u2019s always considered himself an independent, voting for Republican and Democrat candidates in state and presidential elections all his life.\n\nIn recent years, however, his worldview has changed.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Recently there was several in one day,\u201d he says. \u201c[Climate change] is real, and people see it, but the propaganda has them not wanting to admit the truth.\u201d\n\nThis year, Held ran as a Democrat for a seat in eastern Montana, finishing second in a primary held on 4 June.\n\n\u201cThe dysfunction in the Republican party now has gone beyond the pale. Our current representative [Republican Matt Rosendale] wouldn\u2019t sign the proposed farm bill, which \u2026 supports programs so that families can make a living on the farms and ranches in Montana.\u201d\n\nA former actor, Held entered politics in large part because of the climate crisis. \u201cI sat in roomfuls of people who said they voted Republican their whole lives but that they were going to vote for me,\u201d says Held.\n\nStill, Trump and other Republican candidates are expected to win rural counties handily across a slate of elections in November, and the challenges facing Democrats in rural America remain large.\n\nView image in fullscreen Attenders of the Iowa state fair in Des Moines, Iowa, wear \u201cFarmers for Trump\u201d hats on 12 August 2023. Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\n\u201cFarmers and rural Americans are values voters,\u201d says Gibbs, who recalls losing around 80% of his friends and colleagues after he spoke out against Trump. \u201cThey will continue to vote against their own interests, particularly in agriculture, because it\u2019s the Republicans who speak to their value systems.\u201d\n\nHe says that Democrats have let themselves be reframed as something that doesn\u2019t match the midwestern value set, such as universally supporting abortion, when \u201cthat\u2019s never what they are for\u201d.\n\nFor Gibbs, the Democratic party could forge inroads with farmers and rural Americans, but to do so would require a recalculation. \u201cThe progressive left has had the microphone for too long,\u201d he says.\n\nHe says he doesn\u2019t expect to see much change in terms of who farmers and rural Americans vote for in November\u2019s election, but that\u2019s not his main focus. He sees a chance of change further in the future.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing here now,\u201d he adds, \u201cis building for [elections in] 2028, 2032.\u201d",

        "text": "Quinnipiac Poll: A nationally recognized leader gauging the pulse of America on politics and policy\nAs the U.S. presidential election ramps up, poll watchers across the country are closely following findings of the Quinnipiac Poll, a nationally recognized leader in public opinion research.\n\nWidely cited by journalists, public officials and researchers as one of the most trusted names among polling organizations, the Quinnipiac Poll\u2019s success starts with asking the right questions at the right time and carries through to generating high-quality data results that national media outlets and other poll consumers can trust, said Doug Schwartz, associate vice president of the Quinnipiac Polling Institute and director of the Quinnipiac Poll.\n\nEqually as important, the Quinnipiac Poll is an independent polling organization using best polling practices and rigorous, gold standard methodology. Staff are members of the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR). The Quinnipiac Poll is a charter member of AAPOR\u2019s Transparency Initiative.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got great people working on the team,\u201d said Schwartz. \u201cWhat makes us stand out nationally is the high-quality data that we produce. I do think this separates us, because there are many polls out there, but there aren\u2019t many high-quality polls.\u201d\n\nThe importance of the Quinnipiac Poll in national elections has grown even more in the past decade as major pollsters including Gallup and Pew Research Center have stopped polling on presidential elections, Schwartz said.\n\n\u201cI think the Quinnipiac Poll has filled a void, and so it\u2019s really important that Quinnipiac continues to be out there producing high-quality, independent polling data,\u201d said Schwartz.\n\nFounded in 1988 at then-Quinnipiac College by a marketing research professor, the late Paul Falcigno, as part of a class project, the first polls were conducted statewide. Schwartz joined the team as poll director in 1994 and is credited with expanding the poll\u2019s reach. The Quinnipiac Poll has gone on to become a dominant national and international leader for gauging the American voting public, on a continual basis, regarding key public policy issues and elections.\n\nThe march to national recognition first began with the poll\u2019s expansion into New York and New Jersey, said Schwartz.\n\n\u201cWe polled on the 1998 U.S. Senate race between Democrat Chuck Schumer and the incumbent Republican Al D'Amato and we were the only poll to accurately predict in that election that Schumer would easily defeat D'Amato,\u201d said Schwartz.\n\nIn the next election cycle, the Quinnipiac Poll was the only poll to accurately predict U.S. Senate candidate Hilary Clinton would win her 2000 race by a comfortable victory margin.\n\n\u201cThose two elections brought us the national attention,\u201d said Schwartz. \u201cAfter that, we started a national poll in 2001, which increased our national visibility. Next, we did something other pollsters weren\u2019t doing at the time \u2014 we started polling in swing states in presidential elections.\u201d\n\nFollowing U.S. presidential candidate Al Gore\u2019s 2000 loss of the electoral college vote, despite winning the popular vote, the Quinnipiac Poll team saw an opportunity to take the lead in polling swing states such as Florida and Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cTo us, that illustrated how important certain swing states were,\u201d said Schwartz.\n\nIn 2008, the Quinnipiac Poll built in another offering making it unique among national polling organizations.\n\n\u201cWe developed a swing state package where we would poll in multiple swing states at once. This was very successful. Our election predictions were right on target,\u201d said Schwartz. \u201cWe\u2019ve continued to produce swing state packages in subsequent elections, which is another way the poll became distinguished nationally.\u201d\n\nFindings of the Quinnipiac Poll are routinely reported by news organizations including The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, Associated Press, BBC, Reuters, USA Today, NPR, ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS, CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC.\n\nFor the June 27 U.S. presidential debate on CNN, the Quinnipiac Poll stands among those national polls meeting CNN\u2019s standards for reporting for candidates who must, among other factors, receive at least 15% in four separate national polls of registered or likely voters.\n\nThe current U.S. presidential race underscores the need to produce accurate, credible polling results, Schwartz said.\n\n\u201cYou have to trust your numbers, and we\u2019ve had a long, successful track record,\u201d said Schwartz. \u201cNonetheless, every election weighs heavily, and you want to do everything that you possibly can to get it right.\u201d\n\nAll results of the Quinnipiac Poll are available for public consumption at its website, which offers data going back nearly 30 years. In 2015, the Library of Congress selected the Quinnipiac Poll website for inclusion in its historic collection of internet materials related to public policy topics.\n\n\u201cWe put all of our poll results on our website so that the average person who just wants more information or wants to dig a little bit deeper on our polls, or do some trend research, can look up a particular topic. We view it as a public service,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cOur transparency is important to us. A lot of other polls don\u2019t explain in detail how they did the poll. We\u2019ve always taken pride in explaining how we do the poll. To me, it\u2019s very important for credibility.\u201d\n\nAt Quinnipiac University, the Quinnipiac Poll also partners with professors to offer a signature experience course to students across disciplines such as political science, marketing research, and journalism.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something that\u2019s special that we offer the students, an opportunity to study and analyze the Quinnipiac Poll data and do reports on our data,\u201d said Schwartz.\n\nQuinnipiac students can also work as poll interviewers.\n\n\u201cThey get a hands-on experience where they learn about professional interviewing techniques, question wording, current events. It\u2019s a good experience,\u201d said Schwartz.",

        "text": "Is The US Election an Investing Opportunity?\nA presidential election might cause short-term turbulence in the markets, creating discomfort for investors as they watch their portfolios churn or worry about the outcome.\n\nUnderstanding the impact elections have historically had on markets can serve as Pepto Bismol for investors with bad gut feelings, however.\n\nAre Democrats or Republicans Better for Stocks?\n\nLooking at 70 years of returns, a Democrat in the White House has been better for investors. Since 1953, $1,000 (\u00a3789.79) invested when a Democrat is president, sold to cash when a Republican takes office, then reinvested when a Democrat returns turns into $62,000. The opposite strategy \u2013 only investing when a Republican sits in the Oval Office \u2013 only grows to $27,000.\n\nReturns Since Eisenhower's 1953 Inauguration\n\n$1,000 invested in the S&P 500 based on the presidential party\n\nSource: Bespoke Investment Group, 1953-2023\n\nHowever, this overlooks critical context: investors would have been better off ignoring Washington DC entirely. The original $1,000 investment turns into nearly $1.7 million for those who never acted on their political preferences and remained invested throughout.\n\nReturns Since Eisenhower's 1953 Inauguration\n\nThe same process is repeated, with dramatically different results\n\nSource: Bespoke Investment Group, 1953-2023\n\nThe stock market goes up and down under every president, but the path of least resistance has always been higher. There's no reason to believe this will change because of November's election. In short, politics can be a significant drag on a portfolio. That's why treating the two like oil and water is essential. That's much easier said than done. And the next few months will be fertile ground for political implications on financial markets.\n\nPolitics Could Impact Dealmaking\n\nMajor policy differences cited between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump include healthcare spending, immigration, and business regulation. One interesting example is the regulatory landscape. Paramount Global (PARA), one of the most famous media brands, has been in the news for months because of its possible sale. After months of \"will they or won't they\" the company recently decided it was no longer for sale.\n\nParamount likely faced expensive and time-consuming litigation to realise this move. The Federal Trade Commission has been aggressively blocking mergers, preventing four in January this year alone. The prevailing theory is that Paramount wants to do the sale, but is better off waiting until after the election. A change in leadership could usher in a friendlier FTC, whose leadership is appointed by the president.\n\nBut theory is one thing; reality is something else entirely. We can pull examples from the last two presidencies in which conventional wisdom indicated one outcome, but something else happened.\n\nPresident Trump and China\n\nAfter Trump won in 2016, it was widely assumed his policies would have terrible consequences for companies with exposure to China. It could be argued that no American company does more business with China than Apple AAPL. A trade war would negatively impact its business. A few headlines at the time made this case:\n\nBut Apple's business performed just fine. Its stock returned nearly eight times the US stock market in the year after these articles were published.\n\nApple vs Market Returns, Sept 2019-Sept 2020\n\nSource: Morningstar Direct\n\nPresident Biden and Energy Companies\n\nTo borrow from Rodney Dangerfield in Caddyshack: \"keep it fair!\" There's a similar example from the Biden presidency. The administration is often viewed as an enemy of the energy industry. One specific agenda item was to make it harder for energy companies to drill by reducing permits.\n\nHeadlines included:\n\nBut like Apple, energy companies did just fine. The returns of energy stocks nearly doubled that of the US stock market over the next year.\n\nEnergy Sector vs Market Returns, Dec 2020-Dec 2021\n\nSource: Morningstar Direct\n\nIn fact, since Biden's inauguration in January 2021, energy has been the best-performing US equity sector. The technology sector, which is in second place, doesn't even come close to its returns.\n\nTotal Returns Since Biden Inauguration\n\nSource: Morningstar Direct, May 31 2024\n\nThese examples and others remind us that conventional wisdom can often be wrong, and that politics influence the stock market less than we might realise.\n\nResist Reacting to Election Volatility\n\nMonetary decisions are full of emotions, biases, and blind spots. There's no need to add another layer of complexity with politics. It's been said that life is 10% what happens and 90% is how people choose to react. The next few months will be a measuring stick.\n\nTo date, markets have been calm \u2013 maybe too calm. The CBOE Volatility Index touched its lowest level in five years last month.\n\nThe VIX Over Time\n\nSource: CBOE, January 2019-May 2024\n\nThe election could be a spark, as election years tend to observe more volatility than other years.\n\nThe Vix is Higher in Election Years\n\nSource: CBOE, January 2019-May 2024\n\nThere's the additional factor that the average year tends to observe a stock market decline of 14%. To date, the largest decline has only been 5%. It's fair to assume a decline of some variety could be on the horizon, but that's not unique to this moment. If it occurs, media coverage will likely prioritise sensationalism over calming long-term perspectives, potentially using politics as a convenient angle to fan more flames.\n\nJust remember, their fiduciary duty is not to you.",

        "text": "Biden campaign picks right-side podium for CNN debate, Trump will have the last word\nBiden's team won the coin toss and chose his position on viewers' screens.\n\nBiden campaign picks right-side podium for CNN debate, Trump will have the last word\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Thursday won the coin toss to secure a podium position on the right side of the stage during the CNN debate next week, but by doing so gave Donald Trump the final closing statement of the 90-minute matchup.\n\nAccording to CNN, the coin landed on tails -- the side chosen by the Biden campaign. The team then got to choose between podium placement or the order of closing arguments, picking to have Biden be on the right side of television and other screens but deliver his closing statement first.\n\nTrump's podium will be on the left side, and he will have the last word by delivering his closing statement after Biden.\n\nThe 90-minute CNN debate, starting at 9 p.m. ET, will take place on June 27 in Atlanta. It is the first of two debates between Biden and Trump, the second taking place on Sept. 10 and hosted by ABC News.\n\nThe CNN debate is being simulcast on ABC and ABC News Live with pre-coverage beginning at 8 p.m. ET on the network and 7 p.m ET on ABCNL.\n\nEarlier this week, other rules were announced by CNN such as muting the candidates' microphone unless it is their turn to speak and allowing no props, only pen, paper and a bottle of water.\n\nThere will be no opening statements, two commercial breaks and no studio audience.\n\nBiden and Trump will be given two minutes to answer questions posed by moderators Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, followed by one minute each to respond and rebut. There will be a red light flashing to indicate to candidates they have five seconds remaining of their allotted time. When their time is over, the light will turn solid red.\n\nJoe Biden speaks, as President Donald Trump, left, listens during the U.S. presidential debate at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee, Oct. 22, 2020. Morry Gash/AP/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nWith exactly a week to go until the debate, both campaigns are beginning to prepare.\n\nPresident Biden is huddling at Camp David with former chief of staff Ron Klain and other longtime advisers and aides.\n\nToward the end of his debate prep, Biden will take part in a 90-minute mock debate where he's standing the whole time, according to Jim Messina, President Barack Obama's campaign manager, who's been in close contact with Biden's team.\n\n\"You got to get used to doing that, and we made Obama do that, too,\" Messina told ABC News Senior White House Correspondent Selina Wang. \"That's another advantage for Trump, because he does stand up at those lecterns and gets his two- or three-hour rambling monologues at his rallies.\"\n\nAs to why Biden chose the right-side podium after winning the coin flip, Messina said Biden just \"likes\" that side and it's a \"personal preference.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Trump is holding policy meetings with advisers and congressional allies on issues like immigration, the economy and democracy. He'll also campaign in Philadelphia over the weekend and attend fundraisers next week.\n\nBiden and Trump will be the only candidates on stage after the qualification window closed at midnight, CNN said.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., running as an independent, fell short of meeting the network's polling and ballot access requirements. He called his exclusion from the stage \"undemocratic, un-American, and cowardly.\"\n\nABC News' Isabella Murray and Will McDuffie contributed to this report.",

        "text": "The day the Constitution was ratified\nOn June 21, 1788, the Constitution became the official framework of the government of the United States of America when New Hampshire became the ninth of 13 states to ratify it. The journey to ratification, however, was a long and arduous process.\n\nUntil the new Constitution was ratified, the country was governed by the Articles of Confederation. That document was tailored to a newly formed nation made of states acting more like independent, sovereign countries, and it quickly became clear to some of America\u2019s leaders that future stability required a stronger, more centralized government. New York\u2019s Alexander Hamilton thus led the call for a constitutional convention to reevaluate the nation\u2019s governing document. The Confederation Congress endorsed his initiative, and representatives from all 13 states were subsequently invited to convene in Philadelphia on May 25, 1787, to participate in the Convention.\n\nThe initial purpose of the Convention was for the delegates to amend the Articles of Confederation; however, the ultimate outcome was the proposal and creation of a completely new form of government. Three months later, on September 17, 1787, the Convention concluded with the signing (by 38 out of 41 delegates present) of the new U.S. Constitution. Under Article VII, it was agreed that the document would not be binding until its ratification by nine of the 13 existing states.\n\nHamilton and James Madison led the lobbying efforts for votes in favor of ratifying the Constitution. With assistance from John Jay, they produced the 85 essays known as \u201cThe Federalist Papers\u201d that explained and defended how the proposed new government would function. The essays were published in newspapers nationwide.\n\nThe first state to ratify the Constitution was Delaware on December 7, 1787, followed by Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia, and Connecticut. Some states voiced opposition to the Constitution on the grounds that it did not provide protection for rights such as freedom of speech, religion, and press. However, the terms of the Massachusetts Compromise reached in February 1788 stipulated that amendments to that effect\u2014what became the Bill of Rights\u2014would be immediately proposed. The constitution was subsequently ratified by Massachusetts, Maryland, South Carolina, and, finally, New Hampshire.\n\nAfter ratification, Congress set dates for the first federal elections and the official implementation of the Constitution. Elections were set to take place from Monday, December 15, 1788, to Saturday, January 10, 1789, and the new government was set to begin on March 4, 1789.\n\nIn the nation\u2019s first presidential election, George Washington was elected President and John Adams was elected Vice President. Congress was also restructured to reflect the system of representation created by the Connecticut Compromise at the Constitutional Convention.\n\nThe Constitution, however, was still evolving. Madison introduced 17 amendments to the Constitution born from the Massachusetts Compromise, of which Congress adopted twelve on September 25, 1789, to send forth to the states for ratification. Ten of those amendments, known as the Bill of Rights, were ratified on December 15, 1791.\n\nEven after the Constitution\u2019s ratification, the U.S. did not begin to look and function remotely like it does today until several years later. The Constitution was not ratified by all states until May 29, 1790, when Rhode Island finally approved the document, and the Bill of Rights was not ratified to become part of the Constitution until the end of the following year. Moreover, the capital was not set until July 16, 1790, almost a year and half after the general elections took place.\n\nThe location of the capital was born, like most decisions in the formation of the budding nation, out of negotiation. Hamilton, now Secretary of the Treasury, sought passage of the Funding Act so that the federal government could assume state Revolutionary War debts and thus endow the government with more economic power. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson wanted to pass the Residence Act, which would set the location of the nation\u2019s capital along the Potomac River and give the South increased political power to check the North\u2019s growing economic power by placing the capital in a location friendly to Southern economic interests.\n\nThe two men struck a deal: Jefferson would persuade Madison, a man with significant influence in the House, to back Hamilton\u2019s Funding Act, thereby garnering him the votes it would need to pass. In return, Hamilton would help Jefferson and Madison secure the votes needed to pass the Residence Act. The capital\u2019s precise geographic location was left to President Washington, and on January 24, 1791\u2014almost three years after the Constitution was first ratified\u2014land was designated for construction.",

        "text": "What happens if a presidential candidate dies or steps down?\nEvery presidential election year is filled with unanswered questions, many of which will only be resolved after votes are cast and a winner is named. In this atmosphere of uncertainty, there are some things we do know, including what happens if one of the candidates in the 2024 race dies or has to withdraw.\n\nIn an explainer from the National Task Force on Election Crisis, a team of election experts outlines exactly what happens when a candidate dies before the election. Here\u2019s what they say:\n\nRead the Task Force's explainer Read the Task Force's explainer\n\nPolitical parties have all the power if a candidate dies while campaigning\n\nIf a candidate dies before Election Day, political parties have primary control over the process of replacing that candidate. There aren\u2019t any laws or parts of the constitution that cover this scenario, and on the few occasions where it has occurred, parties have been the principal actors. The exact process depends in large part on when the death occurs.\n\nWant more Democracy Insights? Subscribe to our weekly newsletter\n\nIf it happens before the nominating conventions, the assembled delegates at the conventions will select the new nominee from among other candidates or potential new entries into the race. If, for example, Barack Obama had died in advance of the 2008 convention, Hilary Clinton, John Edwards, and the rest of the Democratic primary field would have worked to curry favor from various delegates prior to the official nomination. Delegates would have then voted, and a new nominee would have been announced. The same process would have occurred had Obama simply dropped out of the race.\n\nIf the death comes after the candidate has been officially nominated, though, the two major parties have different rules for selecting a new candidate:\n\nIn the Democratic Party \u201cthe members of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) choose the new nominee during a special session called by the chair. Per the Task Force\u2019s explainer, \u201cThe DNC chair is required to consult with Democratic congressional leadership and the Democratic Governors Association, and then reports to DNC members who choose.\u201d\n\nRead more: Why do we need political parties? Read more: Why do we need political parties?\n\nThe Democrats actually engaged in this process in 1972, when vice presidential nominee Thomas Eagleton withdrew from the race, and was replaced by Sargent Shriver after a vote from the DNC.\n\nThe Republican Party, meanwhile, vests the power to choose a new nominee with the Republican National Committee (RNC). As the explainer lays out, \u201cmembers would vote as part of their state delegation under the same vote distribution used for the convention itself, and delegation members could divide their votes if they did not agree. Alternatively, the Republicans could reconvene the national convention.\u201d\n\nHow does replacing a candidate after their official nomination change the ballots themselves?\n\nThe question of nominating a new candidate only addresses one of the issues that would arise if a candidate died. While ballots for the general election are generally not printed until the fall, and it\u2019s possible to make changes before those ballots are printed, if the ballots have already been printed, things become much more difficult. The Task Force explainer again:\n\nSeveral administrative processes in the lead-up to elections make last-minute changes difficult. For example, election administrators must conduct pre-election programming and testing before ballots are printed. In addition, at least some ballots must be printed well in advance of Election Day to accommodate military and overseas voting as well as absentee or mail-in voting as permitted in the jurisdiction. A combination of federal and state law governs such processes and as such is not uniform across jurisdictions. This lack of uniformity could contribute to confusion.\n\nIn our presidential election system, however, voters cast their ballots not for a specific candidate but for a slate of electors pledged to that candidate through the electoral college. As a result, votes for a replaced presidential or vice presidential candidate really go to a slate of electors, and those electors (who usually have a strong party loyalty because of how they are appointed) could transfer their votes to the new nominee.\n\nParties are a crucial part of our democracy\n\nFor all of the flack that they receive, parties serve an essential role in our election process. In an unfortunate scenario like death or incapacitation, parties are responsible for ensuring that the process of replacing a presidential candidate does not devolve into chaos. They provide an organizing mechanism that should instill confidence in voters that unlikely contingencies have been evaluated and planned for. If this sort of tragedy were ever to strike during an election season, it is the parties who would guide us toward a definitive resolution.",

        "text": "Exclusive: US confirms Iran will run absentee ballot stations in US\nThe Biden administration will again allow Iran to run absentee voter stations on U.S. soil for next week\u2019s Iranian presidential election, VOA has learned, prompting the Islamic republic\u2019s critics to denounce the plan as absurd and shameful.\n\nIranian Foreign Ministry official Alireza Mahmoudi told state media on Sunday that Tehran is planning to set up more than 30 ballot stations across the United States for the June 28 vote to replace Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, who died in a helicopter crash last month.\n\nMahmoudi said ballot boxes for Iranian absentee voters would be set up at the Iranian Interests Section of the Pakistani embassy in Washington and in New York but did not identify other locations.\n\nIranian state media say the United States is home to the largest proportion of overseas-based Iranians at 30%. The U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey estimates there are about half a million people born in Iran or of Iranian origin in the U.S., while the Iranian American nonprofit group National Union for Democracy in Iran, or NUFDI, says it has a higher estimate of more than 1 million.\n\nCanada and Turkey follow with 12% shares of the Iranian diaspora, according to Iranian state media. Mahmoudi said Iran is arranging absentee voting in other diaspora locations as well.\n\nIn a statement reported exclusively by VOA, the U.S. State Department said on Friday it has no expectation that Iran\u2019s presidential election will be free or fair. The Islamic republic\u2019s ruling clerics permit only loyalists of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to run for offices such as president and parliament, which are subservient to him on key policy issues.\n\nIran\u2019s last parliamentary and presidential elections, in March and 2021, respectively, drew record-low official turnouts, with the lack of choices leaving much of the electorate disinterested.\n\nOpponents of Iran\u2019s clerical rulers at home and abroad repeatedly have called for boycotts of Iranian elections, which they view as shams, and they have done so again for the June 28 vote. They also have noted that the Islamic republic seeks legitimacy for its 45-year authoritarian rule by trying to boost turnout for such elections.\n\nVOA asked the State Department how authorizing ballot stations in the U.S. for Iran, whose poor human rights record it has strongly criticized, is consistent with the U.S. view of Iranian elections as neither free nor fair.\n\nA spokesperson responded by noting that Iran set up U.S.-based ballot stations for previous presidential elections, in 2021 and 2017, with approval from the Biden administration and its predecessor, the Trump administration, respectively.\n\n\u201cThis is nothing new,\u201d the spokesman said, in reference to the planned ballot stations for next week's vote.\n\nRichard Goldberg, a senior adviser to the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies, countered that permitting Iran to engage in another round of absentee balloting on U.S. soil is a \u201ctheater of the absurd.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to VOA, Goldberg wrote: \u201cHow and why we would facilitate such a charade for a state sponsor of terrorism that is hunting Americans every day is beyond me.\u201d He also questioned who would be operating Iran\u2019s ballot stations in the U.S. and what relationship they have to the Iranian government.\n\nVOA put those questions to Iran\u2019s U.N. mission, which responded by saying it declines to comment because it \u201cbelieves the issue is not of interest to an American audience.\u201d\n\nA day before Iran\u2019s 2021 presidential election, the Iranian Interests Section in Washington published an online chart showing the addresses of ballot stations in 29 U.S. cities where Iranian citizens could vote. Besides the Interests Section, the other listed venues included 20 properties of U.S. and British hotel companies and eight Islamic centers. There was no indication of who operated the stations.\n\nVOA contacted three hotels that hosted the 2021 ballot stations on Friday to ask if they were planning to host such stations again next week. Staff members who answered the phones at the Marriott Spring Hill Suites in Gaithersburg, Maryland, and at the Hilton Garden Inn Irvine-Orange County Airport in California said they had no record of such events on their schedules. A woman who answered the phone at the Comfort Inn Sandy Springs in Atlanta, Georgia, repeatedly hung up when asked if it is hosting an event next Friday.\n\nCameron Khansarinia, vice president of the Iranian American group NUFDI, told VOA that diaspora Iranians have a responsibility to protest the Islamic republic\u2019s \u201cshameful\u201d absentee voter stations wherever they are set up.\n\nIn reference to those who operate and vote at the planned ballot stations, Khansarinia said, \u201cWhile we should respect the physical safety of these individuals and U.S. law, they deserve to be publicly shamed for their absolutely amorality.\u201d\n\nVOA also asked the State Department whether U.S. authorities have granted licenses to businesses and nonprofit groups that plan to host the Iranian ballot stations to exempt them from U.S. sanctions that generally prohibit the provision of commercial services to Iran.\n\nThe spokesperson replied, \u201cForeign governments carrying out election-related activities in the U.S. must do so in a manner consistent with U.S. law and regulations.\u201d\n\nThe Treasury Department did not respond to similar questions sent by VOA on Tuesday, regarding the granting of licenses for Iranian ballot stations.\n\nBrian O\u2019Toole, a former senior adviser in the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, told VOA it is a gray area.\n\nO\u2019Toole, a nonresident senior fellow at the Washington-based Atlantic Council, identified two U.S. regulations, OFAC\u2019s General License E and the Code of Federal Regulations section 560.545, as potentially permitting election activity and democracy-building in Iran.\n\n\u201cDespite the Iranian government's issues with elections, the U.S. has a clear interest in promoting democracy,\u201d said O\u2019Toole, who managed OFAC\u2019s sanctions program during former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201cWhat this administration probably would lean toward is the principle that people who are eligible to vote [in Iran\u2019s election] should make the decision as to whether they should or should not,\u201d he said.",

        "text": "No props, no notes, no audience \u2013 but Trump-Biden debate will have ad breaks\n\u201cWill you shut up, man?\u201d It was hardly oratory worthy of Abraham Lincoln, but Joe Biden\u2019s primal plea in the face of relentless interruptions and heckling from Donald Trump provided a defining soundbite of the 2020 presidential debates.\n\nThe two will face each other again on Thursday for the first of two head-to-head debates for the 2024 campaign, under new rules designed to prevent matters degenerating as they did four years ago. The US president and the former president will meet in a TV studio without the presence of a partisan audience, which some saw as an essential ingredient of Trump\u2019s rabble-rousing approach. And to counteract the repeated butting-in that so irked Biden, the candidates will have their microphones muted when they are not speaking.\n\nBut the debates are also the first in decades to be held entirely by commercial TV networks \u2013 including two advertising breaks \u2013 and without the oversight of the Commission on Presidential Debates, the long-established, independent, non-partisan body that has long governed the debate rules. Some critics say they fear that commercialising the process could lead to less substantive, shorter answers, geared more to generating conflict and soundbites than enlightening voters.\n\nThe verbal volleys in 2020 between Biden and Trump, under the Fox News moderator Chris Wallace, became so vitriolic that the CNN presenter Dana Bash was prompted, live on air, to describe the event as \u201ca shitshow\u201d. Earlier this year, both campaigns chose to circumvent the Commission on Presidential Debates, which had overseen presidential debates since 1988, and on 27 June, Bash and her CNN co-presenter, Jake Tapper, will have a chance to improve on Fox\u2019s effort when they preside over the first debate in Atlanta. A second debate will take place on 10 September, to be hosted by ABC.\n\nNo props or prewritten notes will be allowed on stage. Candidates will be given a pen, a notepad and a bottle of water.\n\nThe decisions to switch off a candidate\u2019s microphone when it is the opponent\u2019s turn to speak, and to exclude a partisan audience, have been taken in an effort to reduce the theatrical gladiatorial bloodsport element that has threatened to overwhelm recent debates.\n\nSome critics said the lack of oversight from the CPD, as well as the inclusion of two commercial breaks during the 90-minute event, undermined the nature of the debate.\n\n\u201cThe introduction of commercial breaks will fundamentally change what makes a debate a debate, since the candidates will constantly be able to stop and regroup,\u201d Clea Conner, chief executive of Open to Debate, a research group that has tracked presidential debates over recent decades, told Politico.\n\n\u201cEven though there will be only two commercial breaks this time, once we deem them acceptable it\u2019s a classic slippery slope; how many will there be next time, and the time after that?\n\n\u201c[Candidates\u2019] arguments will have to be shorter, truncated for the commercial clock, and will result in more outrageous interactions to bump ratings.\u201d Without the presence of an independent broker such as the CPD, she argued, it would lead to \u201cpure political theatre\u201d.\n\nOpen to Debate\u2019s report into the deterioration of debate quality attested to the need for drastic format changes from 2020, in order to arrest a decline in moderator control and candidate decorum.\n\nWhile there were just three interruptions across three debates in the 2004 election between George W Bush and John Kerry \u2013 administered by the CPD \u2013 the first 2020 Trump-Biden encounter witnessed 76, the group noted. However, the second debate saw just four interruptions, after non-speakers\u2019 microphones were muted following criticism of the chaos three weeks earlier.\n\nSteven Fein, a professor of psychology at Williams College in Massachusetts, who has studied the psychological dimension of presidential debates, said excluding a loudly cheering live audience was \u201crational\u201d and \u201cgood for democracy\u201d.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Because the audience reaction may or may not be valid.\u201d\n\nHe warned, however, that the commercial TV networks may jettison the new approach \u201cbecause it makes for less exciting television\u201d.\n\nThe candidate with more to lose in the controlled, low-key environment is probably Trump, according to Tammy Vigil, associate professor of communications at Boston University.\n\n\u201cHe tends to feed off of the energy of a crowd,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019ll lose some of his energy by not having a crowd to feed off. The other part that\u2019ll probably change is that the candidates will be more apt to speak to the cameras directly.\n\n\u201cI think that will improve the overall feel of the debate for television viewers because it\u2019ll feel like the candidates are speaking more directly to them.\u201d",

        "text": "From Sada Baby to Queen Latifah: Rappers and what they mean to Trump and Biden in 2024\nFormer President Obama picked Kendrick Lamar over Drake when asked in 2016 who would win in a rap battle. Since his presidency, rappers have had an elevated, if informal, platform in politics, making their own preferences for president known too.\n\nAnd in 2024, while notable rap artists lean towards President Biden, former President Donald Trump has also seen his support grow, too, especially among younger rappers.\n\nOn Tuesday, Vice President Kamala Harris joined rapper Quavo, of the \"Migos,\" in Atlanta for a summit centered around gun violence prevention. Last Saturday, Detroit rapper Sada Baby was outside the 180 Church in Detroit, encouraging people to vote for Trump.\n\nFile: Vice President Kamala Harris speaks with rapper Quavo at the Rocket Foundation Summit on gun violence prevention at the Carter Center on June 18, 2024 in Atlanta. ELIJAH NOUVELAGE/AFP via Getty Images\n\nTrump and the rappers who back him\n\nSome of the rappers supporting Trump have cult, regional followings, while others are charting on Billboard. They cite a variety of reasons for backing Trump: COVID-19 era stimulus checks, the Payment Protection Program, his pardons of rappers and a dissonance in the current political system.\n\nIn 2020, Trump pardoned both Lil Wayne and Kodak Black on his way out of the White House in 2021. Kodak Black is among those in the \"Black Americans for Trump'' coalition this cycle.\n\nFile: Donald Trump is endorced by rappers Sheff G and Sleepy Hallow Speaks at a campaign event at Crotona Park in the South Bronx on Thursday, May 23, 2024. in New York City. Steven Ferdman/GC Images\n\nNew York City rappers Sheff G and Sleepy Hallow, fixtures of Brooklyn's \"drill\" rap subgenre, spoke at a Trump rally in the Bronx in May. Both were indicted on murder conspiracy charges in May 2023.\n\nFile: Rapper Sada Baby performs onstage during the WJLB Big Holiday Show at Little Caesars Arena on December 17, 2021 in Detroit. Aaron J. Thornton / Getty Images\n\nSada Baby, whose 2020 single \"Whole Lotta Choppas\" has over 55 million listens on Spotify, was one of three Detroit rappers, joining Peezy and Icewear Vezzo, to attend Mr. Trump's roundtable last week with local Black community leaders.\n\n\"A lot of Democrats assume that [we're] just supposed to vote blindly. I feel like our votes should be worked for, I feel like our parents blindly voted for generations, but I think this generation is now understanding that we have to ask questions,\" Vezzo, who said he's leaning towards Mr. Trump for his vote, told Fox News.\n\nSt. Louis rapper Sexyy Red, who has two singles on Billboard's \"Hot 100\" chart, cited COVID-19 stimulus checks as part of why she supports the former president.\n\n\"Once he started getting Black people out of jail and giving people that free money. Aww baby, we love Trump\u2026 We need him back because, baby, them checks,\" she said on a podcast with comedian Theo Von in October 2023.\n\nMr. Trump's past campaigns have involved rappers \u2014 one of his closing rallies in Michigan before the 2020 election featured Florida rapper Lil Pump, who Trump mistakenly called \"Lil Pimp.\" Ice Cube was an adviser in 2020 to Trump on a proposal to help Black Americans.\n\nAnd while controversial rapper Kanye West ran his own tumultuous third-party 2020 presidential campaign to challenge Trump \u2013 the former president dined with West and white nationalist Nick Fuentes in 2022, and the two have known each other for years. West endorsed Mr. Trump in February.\n\nFile: Rapper Kanye West, left, shakes hands with U.S. President Donald Trump during a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Thursday, Oct. 11, 2018. Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nJaniyah Thomas, the Trump campaign's Black media director, said Trump is meeting with rappers, pastors, and business leaders and argued his engagement with rappers is \"completely organic.\"\n\n\"His message resonates with these artists and their audiences, largely in Black communities, who feel ripped off by Joe Biden's terrible economic and immigration policies,\" Thomas added.\n\nIn response to Trump's pursuit of support from rappers, Biden campaign senior spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said Trump has \"spent his life and political career disrespecting Black communities every chance he gets.\"\n\n\"It's why the first thing he did after taking over the RNC was shut down its minority outreach centers, and it's why his campaign keeps staging their so-called 'outreach' in white neighborhoods and in front of white audiences,\" she added. \"Our campaign is on the ground engaging with our communities on the issues that matter.\"\n\nTrump's past support from rap artists didn't translate into decisive electoral gains among Black or younger voters \u2013 often Democratic leaning groups \u2013 who make up the bulk of rap listeners according to a CBS News 2022 poll.\n\nAccording to CBS News exit polls, Trump won 8% Black support in 2016 and 12% in 2020. Among younger voters, those between 18 and 29 years old, 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton (55%) and Mr. Biden (60%) still captured a majority of their support.\n\nBiden campaign leans into music festival canvassing, Black outreach events\n\nBut polls this year also show Biden's support among Black and younger voters slightly softening. The Biden campaign has responded with record investments of money and time in voter outreach.\n\nNew York City rapper Fat Joe, an advocate for affordable healthcare, took part in a March panel with Harris about decriminalizing marijuana. Queen Latifah and Lizzo performed at a New York City fundraiser for the campaign in March. Singer John Legend, whose catalog features frequent collaborations with rappers, is backing Mr. Biden for a second time and called Trump a \"dyed-in-the-wool racist\" in an MSNBC interview.\n\nFile: President Joe Biden and Queen Latifah at the The Kennedy Center Honorees reception at The White House on December 03, 2023 in Washington, DC. Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images / Getty Images\n\nThe Biden campaign notes it's been active in not just courting rappers' endorsements, but their audiences as well.\n\nThe Biden campaign told CBS News it will have a presence at the \"Essence Festival of Culture,\" the largest Black culture and music event in the U.S., and have paid media partnerships and meetings planned with Black celebrities and musicians at the upcoming BET awards in Los Angeles.\n\nThe campaign also had canvassers at the April \"Dreamville Fest\" in Raleigh, North Carolina, put on by Grammy-nominated rapper J Cole, and had plans for R&B singer Usher's \"Lovers & Friends\" festival in Las Vegas in May, though the festival was canceled due to weather.\n\n\"The Democratic party has been very intentional and consistent about their outreach and engagement [with Black voters],\" said Democratic strategist Antjuan Seawright. \"I recognize that certainly there's more work to do because when you are the most decisive and loyal [voting] bloc\u2013 the biggest room in the house is the room for improvement.\"\n\nIn 2020, Mr. Biden was backed by Offset, another Migos member, and Chicago rapper Common, who performed at an Atlanta campaign rally. Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny also voiced campaign ads targeting Latino voters in Florida, Arizona and Pennsylvania.\n\nSkepticism about impact of Trump's popularity with rappers\n\nPolitical strategists, and political science professors who study rap music don't believe either candidate's support from artists will shift the race in a meaningful way.\n\n\"We're not monolithic in any way shape or form,\" Seawright said of Black voters. \"I don't think you'll see some mass sprint to Donald Trump because you have a few artists who show up with him or make an appearance.\"\n\nCorey Miles, a Tulane University sociology professor who studies the intersection of trap music, a rap subgenre created in the south, and incarceration, said Trump has \"always had a connection in the Black imagination,\" primarily from his days as a celebrity businessman.\n\n\"I don't think it's any different than what we've kind of always seen Black people do in terms of our diversity [in voting]. I just think Trump is such a sensationalist person, that when Black folks support him, it feels different or more of an outlier than it actually is,\" Miles said.\n\nDuring a February speech at the Black Conservative Freedom Gala in Columbia, S.C., Trump suggested Black voters support him because they view him as \"being discriminated against\" following his indictments. \"They see what's happening to me happens to them,\" he added.\n\nFollowing the release of his Atlanta mugshot in August 2023, rapper Chief Keef posted a photoshopped picture of Trump throwing up gang signs and wrote, \"I know whatever deck he on[,] he good in the hood for sure[.] he finna run the prison.\"\n\nA majority, 85%, of Black voters surveyed in a June CBS News poll believed Trump received a fair trail in his hush money payments case. A majority also considered it \"very serious\" and a \"major factor\" in their vote.\n\n\"What's crazy to me is from the beginning of time, America has always told how to treat a convicted felon. Now that he's a convicted felon you want the rules to change,\" Florida artist Plies, a frequent critic of Mr. Trump, said on his song \"Convicted Felon.\"\n\nTricia Rose, a Director of the Center for the Study of Race and Ethnicity in America at Brown University who has authored books about rap history and race, said Trump has \"manipulated that ID of what Black felony status means for his own purposes.\"\n\nRose noted some of Trump's disparaging comments about crime in predominantly Black cities and his call for the death penalty of the \"Central Park 5,\" five minority teenagers wrongfully convicted of raping a woman in 1989.\n\n\"What he's done is using kind of grotesque imagery \u2014 gold sneakers and so on \u2014 to create a relationship to a constituency that he's been brutal about,\" Rose said, referencing the Trump campaign's sale of limited edition gold sneakers.\n\n\"It's a very shrewd manipulation, that hopefully other young MCs who have a different understanding, perhaps a broader understanding, can jump in and challenge this,\" she added.\n\nThe undecided and those to left of Biden\n\nOther rappers remain undecided. 50 Cent, who was on Capitol Hill to talk about Black entrepreneurship, told CBS News he's unsure who he'll vote for this time. He switched his support from Trump to Biden in 2020.\n\nCardi B, who backed Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in 2020 and Mr. Biden in the general election, said she won't vote at all due to disappointment with the economy.\n\nSome artists have also been outspoken about the Biden administration's response to Israeli strikes in Gaza. Macklemore's pro-Gaza single, \"Hind's Hall,\" where he explicitly states he will not vote for Mr. Biden, has become an unofficial anthem for pro-Palestinian protests.\n\nBiden administration officials have supported sending more military aid to Israel, but has also been working towards a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\n\"The blood is on your hands, Biden, we can see it all. And **k no, I'm not votin' for you in the fall,\" Macklemore raps.\n\nTaurean Small and Shawna Mizelle contributed reporting to this story.",

        "text": "Trump endorses Ten Commandments in schools, implores evangelical Christians to vote in November\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump told a group of evangelicals they \u201ccannot afford to sit on the sidelines\u201d of the 2024 election, imploring them at one point to \u201cgo and vote, Christians, please!\u201d\n\nTrump also endorsed displaying the Ten Commandments in schools and elsewhere while speaking to a group of politically influential evangelical Christians in Washington on Saturday. He drew cheers as he invoked a new law signed in Louisiana this week requiring the Ten Commandments to be displayed in every public school classroom.\n\n\u201cHas anyone read the \u2018Thou shalt not steal\u2019? I mean, has anybody read this incredible stuff? It\u2019s just incredible,\u201d Trump said at the gathering of the Faith & Freedom Coalition. \u201cThey don\u2019t want it to go up. It\u2019s a crazy world.\u2019\u2019\n\nTrump a day earlier posted an endorsement of the new law on his social media network, saying: \u201cI LOVE THE TEN COMMANDMENTS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS, PRIVATE SCHOOLS, AND MANY OTHER PLACES, FOR THAT MATTER. READ IT \u2014 HOW CAN WE, AS A NATION, GO WRONG???\u201d\n\nThe former president and presumptive Republican presidential nominee backed the move as he seeks to galvanize his supporters on the religious right, which has fiercely backed him after initially being suspicious of the twice-divorced New York City tabloid celebrity when he first ran for president in 2016.\n\nAP correspondent Julie Walker reports Donald Trump addresses a conservative Christian group urging them to get out an vote.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nThat support has continued despite his conviction in the first of four criminal cases he faces, in which a jury last month found him guilty of falsifying business records for what prosecutors said was an attempt to cover up a hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels just before the 2016 election. Daniels claims she had a sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier, which he denies.\n\nTrump\u2019s stated opposition to signing a nationwide ban on abortion and his reluctance to detail some of his views on the issue are at odds with many members of the evangelical movement, a key part of Trump\u2019s base that\u2019s expected to help him turn out voters in his November rematch with Democratic President Joe Biden.\n\nBut while many members of the movement would like to see him do more to restrict abortion, they cheer him as the greatest champion for the cause because of his role in appointing U.S. Supreme Court justices who overturned national abortion rights in 2022.\n\nTrump highlighted that Saturday, saying, \u201cWe did something that was amazing,\u201d but the issue would be left to people to decide in the states.\n\n\u201cEvery voter has to go with your heart and do what\u2019s right, but we also have to get elected,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile he still takes credit for the reversal of Roe v. Wade, Trump has also warned abortion can be tricky politically for Republicans. For months, he deferred questions about his position on a national ban.\n\nLast year, when Trump addressed the Faith & Freedom Coalition, he said there was \u201ca vital role for the federal government in protecting unborn life\u201d but didn\u2019t offer any details beyond that.\n\nIn April of this year, Trump said he believed the issue should now be left to the states. He later stated in an interview that he would not sign a nationwide ban on abortion if it was passed by Congress. He has still declined to detail his position on women\u2019s access to the abortion pill mifepristone.\n\nAbout two-thirds of Americans say abortion should generally be legal, according to polling last year by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\nAttendees at the evangelical gathering on Saturday said that while they\u2019d like to see a national abortion ban, Trump isn\u2019t losing any of their deep support.\n\n\u201cI would prefer if he would sign a national ban,\u201d said Jerri Dickinson, a 78-year-old retired social worker and Faith & Freedom member from New Jersey. \u201cI understand though, that as in accordance with the Constitution, that decision should be left up to the states.\u201d\n\nDickinson said she can\u2019t stand the abortion law in her state, which does not set limits on the procedure based on gestational age. But she said outside of preferring a national ban, leaving the issue to the state \u201cis the best alternative.\u201d\n\nAccording to AP VoteCast, a wide-ranging survey of the electorate, about 8 in 10 white evangelical Christian voters supported Trump in 2020, and nearly 4 in 10 Trump voters identified as white evangelical Christians. White evangelical Christians made up about 20% of the overall electorate that year.\n\nBeyond just offering their own support in the general election, the Faith & Freedom Coalition plans to help get out the vote for Trump and other Republicans, aiming to use volunteers and paid workers to knock on millions of doors in battleground states.\n\nTrump also rallied voters in Philadelphia on Saturday with a speech heavily focused on violent crime, telling supporters at an arena that he would grant police officers immunity from prosecution.\n\n\u201cUnder Crooked Joe, the City of Brotherly Love is being ravaged by bloodshed and crime,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will surge federal law enforcement resources to the places that need them most.\u201d\n\nStatistics from the Philadelphia city controller say there were 410 homicides in 2023, a 20% drop compared to 2022.\n\nTyler Cecconi, 25, of Richmond, Virginia, said he was glad that Trump is stepping out of his comfort zone and going to places that may not be red. At the venue, a digital banner read \u201cPhiladelphia is Trump Country.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s showing the people that regardless if you vote for him or not, or if it\u2019s a blue county or a red county, it doesn\u2019t matter to him,\u201d Cecconi said. \u201cA president is for everybody in this country.\u201d\n\nThe GOP Senate candidate of Pennsylvania, Dave McCormick, attended the rally and appeared on stage to talk to voters about the economy and immigration.\n\n\u201cThis economy is not working for most Pennsylvanians, and it\u2019s not working for most Americans,\u201d McCormick said.\n\nAt both events, Trump returned several times to the subject of the U.S.-Mexico border and when describing migrants crossing it as \u201ctough,\u201d he said that he told his friend Dana White, the president of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, to enlist them in a new version of the sport.\n\n\u201c\u2018Why don\u2019t you set up a migrant league and have your regular league of fighters. And then you have the champion of your league, these are the greatest fighters in the world, fighting the champion of the migrants,\u2019\u201d Trump described saying to White. \u201cI think the migrant guy might win, that\u2019s how tough they are. He didn\u2019t like that idea too much.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign responded to Trump\u2019s remarks by saying it was \u201cfitting\u201d that Trump, convicted of a felony, spent time at a religious conference making threats about immigration and \u201cbragging about ripping away Americans\u2019 freedoms.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s incoherent, unhinged tirade showed voters in his own words that he is a threat to our freedoms and is too dangerous to be let anywhere near the White House again,\u201d campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in a statement.\n\n___\n\nAlexander reported from Philadelphia.

        "text": "Could Zarif tilt Iran's election toward long shot Reformist Pezeshkian?\nZarif back in the arena\n\nIran\u2019s sole reformist candidate for president, lawmaker Masoud Pezeshkian, has shaken up the race by enlisting former Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif as his foreign policy adviser.\n\nZarif, who served as foreign minister under President Hassan Rouhani (2013-2021), was the architect of the Iran nuclear deal, which was cheered by Iranians when signed in 2015.\n\nIran\u2019s economy surged the next three years, until US President Donald Trump withdrew from the accord in 2018 and imposed even tougher sanctions on Iran.\n\nMany Iranians nonetheless may look back with some nostalgia at the Rouhani era, when the Iranian economy began to bounce back as a result of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the official name of the nuclear deal, and when Zarif\u2019s role on the world stage opened a door to the West.\n\nZarif, seated next to Pezeshkian on a TV panel last week, made an impassioned case for the positive economic impact of the nuclear deal. The numbers are on Zarif\u2019s side \u2014 Iran\u2019s economy was better then than now.\n\n\u201cZarif remains very popular, and his role in the campaign could unsettle the establishment,\u201d said Al-Monitor contributor Ali Hashem, who was recently in Iran.\n\nIt\u2019s already happening. The other five presidential candidates and the conservative press have now made Rouhani and Zarif, as well as Pezeshkian, the targets of attacks.\n\nA message to the United States and the West\n\nPezeshkian says diplomacy is the best path for sanctions relief and economic progress. By enlisting Zarif, he is sending a signal to the United States and the West, as well as to Iranians, about a possible change of course in Iranian foreign policy if he wins.\n\n\u201cWhen you think of Zarif, you think of dialogue with the United States,\u201d said Hashem.\n\nDealing with the United States, and maybe even US President Donald Trump, looms over the election, said Vali Nasr, a professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, in this week\u2019s On the Middle East podcast with Amberin Zaman.\n\nIranians and many others in the region are already planning for a Trump win, said Nasr. A second Trump administration could mean a new push for maximum pressure or the art of the deal \u2014 or both.\n\nIran\u2019s potential for a nuclear weapons breakout remains a top priority for Washington no matter who wins the US presidential election on Nov. 5. Reports this week indicate that Iran has expanded production of highly enriched uranium production at two of its nuclear plants, shortening the timeline needed to roll out a nuclear weapon if it makes the decision to do so.\n\nAnd, as Nasr points out, if Trump ends Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine, as he has said he would do, this would be a game changer in global politics with consequences for Iran, which has deepened its military and economic ties with Russia since the war.\n\nReformists all in on Pezeshkian\n\nThe establishment and the hard-line Guardian Council, which vets candidates, may not have anticipated the possible impact of Zarif coming off the bench for Pezeshkian.\n\nPezeshkian, a low-key heart surgeon, was likely envisioned to slightly boost interest and turnout, not to rally the reformists and maybe split the conservative vote \u2014 a solid 20% or so of the electorate \u2014 among the other five candidates.\n\n\u201cThe council's recurrent purge of heavyweight moderate politicians has been interpreted as an attempt by the hard-line-controlled establishment to choreograph victory for its favored candidates,\u201d wrote our correspondent from Tehran. \u201cCritics have also argued that the move to allow only one reformist candidate (with limited charisma) to enter the race has been meant merely to lift voter participation following record-low turnouts in the past two.\u201d\n\nThe current election was called after the deaths of President Ebrahim Raisi (2021-2024) and other officials in a helicopter crash on May 19, 2024.\n\nRaisi\u2019s election three years ago was met with apathy and quiet disgust among many Iranians, especially those under 30, who make up 60% of its population of 90 million. Only 49% of Iranians voted in the 2021 election in the lowest turnout ever. The second-largest vote-getter after Raisi was blank or invalid ballots, a reflection of widespread malaise and discontent.\n\nRaisi\u2019s election as president in 2021 signaled the dominance of the principlists, as the conservative camp is known. After Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal in 2018, conservatives pilloried Rouhani, Zarif and reformists for a catastrophic (in their score) and humiliating foreign policy failure. The reformists have suffered a three-year losing streak in parliament, now controlled by the principlists, aided of course by the Guardian Council. Zarif exited the stage for a mostly off-the-radar professorship at Tehran University.\n\nRaisi gave priority to strengthening ties with Russia, China and the Gulf states, including restoring relations with Saudi Arabia, while tensions with the United States and Israel escalated in Iraq, Lebanon and Gaza.\n\nAt home, Raisi\u2019s administration was dogged by sanctions, a failing economy, increased corruption, poor government services and crackdown on dissent. The death in custody of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in September 2022 for a hijab violation sparked widespread anti-government protests. Raisi\u2019s government gave no ground on reform and imprisoned and killed many protesters.\n\nIf the candidates are asking whether you were better off under Rouhani or \"the martyr Raisi,\" as he is referred to, they may not like the answer. The status quo is not a winning hand, and they all seem to know it.\n\nA history of surprise\n\nIran\u2019s presidential elections have a tendency to surprise.\n\nIn 1997, reformist candidate Mohammad Khatami won an upset landslide with 69% of the vote over parliament speaker Ali Akbar Nategh-Nouri (25%).\n\nIn 2005, the populist Mahmoud Ahmadinejad upset Akbar Rafsanjani, former president and chairman of the powerful Expediency Discernment Council, 63% to 37%.\n\nMore on Iran",

NBC News has previously reported that Trump is zeroing in on Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida as possible top contenders.\n\nSources familiar with the selection process told NBC News that Burgum and Vance are considered the top two finalists. Rubio is still being considered, though a constitutional hiccup would require that either Trump or Rubio establish residency outside of Florida.\n\nTrump senior adviser Brian Hughes said in a statement that the campaign\u2019s top criterion for selecting a running mate \u201cis a strong leader who will make a great President for eight years after his next four year term concludes.\u201d\n\nTrump is holding informal policy sessions with confidants in the lead-up to the debate, including possible vice presidential contenders. Vance spoke with Trump about the economy and inflation, and Rubio met with Trump when the former president was in Washington, D.C., this month.\n\nHis Saturday comments came during a stop at a Philadelphia restaurant ahead of a rally. Pennsylvania is expected to be a vital swing state on the road to the White House. Biden flipped Pennsylvania blue in 2020 and continues to campaign across the state as the election approaches.\n\nThe former president said he plans to announce his vice presidential pick \u201cright around the convention.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe a little before, but could be at the convention,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll have some great people.\u201d\n\nThe Republican National Convention, at which delegates from across the country will officially nominate the party\u2019s candidates for president and vice president, is set to be held July 15-18 in Milwaukee.\n\nJake Traylor and Dasha Burns reported from Philadelphia.

With a $50m (\u00a339.5m) donation made on 31 May, 81-year-old Timothy Mellon has become the largest donor to the former president so far during this electoral cycle. Mr Mellon, the heir to the Pittsburgh-based Mellon banking family, also has been the biggest donor to independent candidate Robert F Kennedy's campaign. The BBC has contacted Mr Mellon for comment about his political donations. Known as a recluse, the Wyoming-based Mr Mellon avoids the spotlight and social circles of other US billionaires. Here's what we know.\n\nGetty Images Mr Mellon's grandfather Andrew was treasury secretary between between 1921 and 1932\n\nWho is Timothy Mellon?\n\nAccording to Forbes magazine, Mr Mellon is a descendant of Thomas Mellon, an Irish immigrant who amassed a fortune in real estate and banking after arriving in the US in 1818. The Mellon family - which also included Mr Mellon's grandfather Andrew, a former US treasury secretary - is today worth over $14bn (\u00a311bn). Forbes estimates that the Mellons are the 34th richest family in the US. Born in 1942, Mr Mellon attended Yale University where he studied city planning. His father was a major donor at the school and provided the funding to establish the Yale Center for British Art - the largest collection of British art outside the United Kingdom. In 1981, Mr Mellon formed Guilford Transportation Industries, a holding company named after his hometown of Guilford, Connecticut. It quickly bought up three major railways that stretched from Canada, through New England and into the mid-Atlantic region of the US. The firm, which had maintained its chief focus on railroads, pivoted in 1998 when it bought the brand of the famed - but long bankrupt - Pan American World Airways. Perhaps influencing the purchase, Mr Mellon had developed a love for flying around this time - logging more than 11,500 hours in the cockpit. \"As owner of the company [Pan Am] and with the skill necessary to do the job, he became a commercial pilot and quite literally kept the American institution that is Pan Am flying,\" reads a synopsis for an upcoming autobiography due to be published in 2025. Through much of this, he served as trustee of the Andew W. Mellon Foundation, stepping down in 2002 after 21 years. Three years later, in 2005, Mr Mellon left his native Connecticut for Wyoming. He has lived there since, avoiding the spotlight and only rarely speaking to the media.\n\nMellon's political views\n\nEven before his recent donation to the Trump campaign, Mr Mellon has a history of donating to conservative candidates and causes. In 2010, Mr Mellon donated about $1.5m to the state of Arizona to defray the legal costs to defend SB 1070, a controversial anti-immigration bill. More recently, Mr Mellon helped bankroll Texas Governor Greg Abbott's construction of a wall along the Mexican border, providing more than $53m for the project in 2021. He also has given money to various Republican-aligned super PACS - or \"political action committees\" - to support conservative candidates. Mr Mellon highlighted some of his political views when he wrote a self-published 2015 memoir. In it, he condemned what he termed \"Slavery Redux\" social safety net programmes. Mr Mellon also wrote that black voters were awarded \"freebies\" in exchange for \"delivering votes\". He claimed this \"largess\" is \"funded by the hardworking folks...who are too honest or too proud to allow themselves to sink into this morass\". In exchange, he claimed, black Americans became \"more belligerent\" and \"slaves of a new master, Uncle Sam\". Mr Mellon, however, has occasionally made small donations to Democrats, including $2,700 for progressive New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's 2018 campaign. He told Bloomberg News in 2020 that she tried to return the donation, but that he refused to cash the cheque. Mr Mellon also expressed admiration for Trump during that rare interview, telling Bloomberg that \"he's done the things he promised to, or tried to do the things he's promised to\". Trump's most notable achievement, according to Mr Mellon, was \"in trade and righting the balance between our country and the rest of the world, especially China\".\n\nMellon's quest for Amelia Earhart",

        "text": "Donald Trump promises Green Card for foreign graduates from U.S. colleges\nSoftening his stance on immigration, former U.S. president Donald Trump has promised to give automatic green cards to foreign students who graduate from U.S. colleges to prevent them from returning to their home countries like India and China where they become multibillionaires.\n\nMr. Trump's departure from the anti-immigrant rhetoric comes ahead of the November presidential election in which immigration and deportation of illegal immigrants are among the key issues for voters.\n\nMr. Trump, however, always supported a merit-based legal immigration system.\n\nAlso Read | Visa politics: On Trump\u2019s immigration policy\n\n\u201cWhat I want to do and what I will do is -- you graduate from a college, I think you should get a Green Card automatically as part of your diploma, a Green Card to be able to stay in this country. And that includes junior colleges too,\u201d Mr. Trump, 78, said in the \u201cAll-In\u201d podcast.\n\nA Green Card, known officially as a permanent resident card, is an identity document showing a person has permanent residency in the United States.\n\nThe podcast was hosted by four venture capitalists: Chamath Palihapitiya, Jason Calacanis, David Sacks, and David Friedberg, three of whom are immigrants.\n\nMr. Trump's remarks came as he was pressed by Calacanis to \u201cpromise us you will give us more ability to import the best and brightest around the world to America.\u201d Mr. Trump, the presumptive candidate from the Republican Party, also lamented \u201cstories where people graduated from a top college or from a college, and they desperately wanted to stay here, they had a plan for a company, a concept, and they can\u2019t \u2014 they go back to India, they go back to China, they do the same basic company in those places.\n\n\"...and they become multi-billionaires employing thousands and thousands of people, and it could have been done here,\" he said.\n\n\"Let me just tell you that it's so sad when we lose people from Harvard, MIT, from the greatest schools. and lesser schools that are phenomenal schools also. And what I wanted to do, and I would have done this, but then we had to solve the COVID problem because that came in and, you know, sort of dominated for a little while, as you perhaps know,\u201d Mr. Trump said in response.\n\nMr. Trump reiterated his first-term policy, about foreign students getting a Green Card after receiving a degree from a higher education institution in the STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) field.\n\n\u201cAnybody graduates from a college, you go in there for two years or four years, If you graduate or you get a doctorate degree from a college, you should be able to stay in this country,\" Mr. Trump said.\n\n\"We force the brilliant people, the people that graduate from college, the people that are number one in their class from the best colleges, you have to be able to recruit these people and keep the people,\u201d he asserted.\n\nSomebody graduates at the top of the class; they can't even make a deal with the company because they don't think they're going to be able to stay in the country.\n\n\"That is going to end on day one,\u201d Mr. Trump announced.\n\nAccording to the latest annual Open Doors report of the Institute of International Education more than a million international students from more than 210 places of origin are studying at U.S. higher education institutions during the 2022-23 academic year.\n\nChina remained the top-sending country in 2022/23, with 289,526 students studying in the U.S. But students from China saw a slight decline of 0.2 per cent compared to the previous year.\n\nIndia, the second largest sending country, reached an all-time high of 268,923 international students in 2022/23, an increase of 35 per cent as against the previous year. Overall 53 per cent of all international students in 2022/23 were from China and India, comparable to the prior year.\n\nHowever, the market share for each place of origin has shifted, with 27% of students from China and 25%t of students from India, in comparison to 33% from China and 18% from India in 2017-18. Mr. Trump\u2019s latest comments stood in contrast to the immigration policy he adopted while in office and were a direct overture to wealthy business leaders whom he is courting as donors and supporters of his campaign, The New York Times said.\n\nMr. Trump had at times sought to reform the nation\u2019s immigration system to scale back family-based immigration and to prioritise wealthy immigrants, who had valuable work skills or who were highly educated.\n\nBut during his term as president, Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration agenda included restrictions on green cards, visa programmes, refugee resettlement and other forms of legal immigration, significantly reducing the number of lawful permanent residents entering the country.\n\nHe began his presidency by signing an executive order that banned travellers from seven predominantly Muslim countries and later embraced a proposal to cut legal immigration by half.\n\nThroughout his presidency, Mr. Trump assailed the H-1B visa programme, favoured by tech companies as a way to hire foreign skilled workers, as a \u201ctheft of American prosperity.\u201d The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows U.S. companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise.\n\nTechnology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.\n\nMr. Trump expanded restrictions on legal immigration during the pandemic and his last year in office and had proposed suspending all immigration to the United States and deporting foreign students if they did not attend at least some classes in person.\n\nA month before the 2020 election, Mr. Trump again moved to restrict the H-1B visa programme.",

What do you think?\u201d Mr. Biden will ask Mr. Donilon, who recently left the White House for the campaign\u2019s Delaware headquarters.\n\nOnce a week, Mr. Biden summons Ron Klain, his former chief of staff, to workshop the best attacks to use against former President Donald J.

        "text": "'Build relationships on both sides': Provinces make push ahead of U.S. election\nProvinces are reaching out to Democrats and Republicans alike to make their case for co-operation, bolstering efforts by the federal government to ensure Canada is prepared for any outcome in the upcoming United States election.\n\n\"I see provinces and Team Canada both ramping up their efforts,\" said Laura Dawson, an expert on Canada-U.S. relations and the executive director of the Future Borders Coalition.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose Liberals came to power in October 2015, was criticized for being unprepared for the first Donald Trump presidency after the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nTheir relationship was notably rocky throughout the Republican leader's four-year tenure.\n\nThe Liberal government is taking a more proactive approach this time around to bolster connections with both the Trump and Joe Biden camps as the tight presidential race continues.\n\nIndustry Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne is making regular visits south of the border as part of the Team Canada engagement strategy. Canada's ambassador to the U.S., Kirsten Hillman, has been pounding the pavement from state to state along with business leaders and stakeholder groups.\n\nDawson said federal-level representatives are going to their American counterparts with topline statements about how \"we build things together.\"\n\nProvinces, on the other hand, drill down on specifics in areas like hydroelectric power, agriculture issues, integrated supply chains in a particular sector and joint investments at the local and regional level.\n\n\"I think Canada really relies on the provincial representatives to get specific, to identify the areas where Americans and Canadians are working together,\" she said.\n\nManitoba Premier Wab Kinew, accompanied by former premier and former Canadian ambassador to the United States Gary Doer, recently travelled to Washington, D.C., and New York City.\n\n\"The purpose of our trip was really to build relationships on both sides of the aisle,\" Kinew said.\n\nTop of mind for Canadians shaking hands with American counterparts is the looming review of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement in 2026. Both presidential candidates are selling protectionist policies that could cause uncertainty for Canadian trade.\n\nDuring his presidency, Trump forced the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement and his administration brought in billions of dollars worth of tariffs, particularly on Chinese imports.\n\nBiden largely kept those tariffs in place, despite promises to reverse them. There's also been tension over the Biden administration's Buy American procurement rules.\n\nKinew said his team wants to ensure it's understood that trade with Manitoba is good for the U.S. and its citizens.\n\n\"If we make that self-interest argument to an American audience, that's a very good foundation for us to have continued prosperity on both sides of the border,\" he said.\n\nIt's essential to maintain a constructive working relationship, said James Rajotte, Alberta's senior representative to the U.S.\n\n\"The quality of life of people who live in Alberta is obviously very directly linked to policy decisions here and the trading relationship we have,\" Rajotte said.\n\nWhen navigating conversations with his American counterparts, Rajotte said, \"you have to read your audience.\"\n\nIn some talks, he might lead the conversation with Alberta\u2019s record on reducing emissions. In others, Rajotte may focus on the role Canada and Alberta can play in energy reliability and security.\n\n\"On a lot of trade issues, the Trump administration and the Biden administration are not really that far apart,\" he said.\n\nNewfoundland and Labrador Premier Andrew Furey also travelled to Washington recently. His office said it was important to show that the relationship \"is one characterized by complementary and not competitive interests.\"\n\nA key selling point for many Canadians is the country\u2019s critical mineral supply.\n\n\"This is one area where even in the midst of all the election season heating up, there's some bipartisan appeal,\" Kinew said.\n\nThe Democrats want critical minerals to advance electrification and the climate agenda, Kinew added, and Republicans want it for defence applications and general economic development.\n\n\"We are now seeing great interest in our Ontario critical minerals and nuclear power advantages among our partners in the United States,\" David Paterson, the province\u2019s representative in Washington, said in an emailed statement.\n\nDawson said Canadians need to focus on a key word that resonates with Americans: security. That can mean energy security, financial security or even Arctic security, she said.\n\n\"Any (phrase) that has 'security' in it has much more attention than just 'we build things together.'\"\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published June 22, 2024.",

        "text": "He wore a toga and spoke Latin. This ancient philosopher can help you survive the anxiety of the 2024 election\nCNN \u2014\n\nSome people obsessively monitor presidential election polls. Others ignore any political news like an overdue bill. And a few probably wish they could just press a button and fast-forward past this November.\n\nAmericans have devised all sorts of strategies to deal with the unrelenting stress of this year\u2019s presidential race. The rematch between President Biden and former President Trump has been called \u201cthe most dreaded election in modern political history.\u201d As the two rivals prepare to debate on Thursday, about six in 10 American adults say they are already worn out by campaign coverage.\n\nBut there\u2019s another way to cope with anxiety about the future \u2014 by turning to the past. Mention the Stoic philosophers of ancient Greece and Rome, and it may conjure images of boring, bearded White men in togas who lived thousands of years ago. But sages like Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius offer plenty of practical advice for today\u2019s voters who are navigating the relentless grind of this year\u2019s presidential election.\n\nStoic philosophy, which teaches that it is impossible to live a happy life without living virtuously, also talks a lot about confronting one\u2019s worse fears. The definition of Stoicism varies, but bestselling author Ryan Holiday describes it as the a \u201ctool in the pursuit of self-mastery, perseverance and wisdom.\u201d\n\nThe first Stoic school was founded in Athens by a philosopher named Zeno of Citium around the beginning of the 3rd century BC. Zeno, who lost his entire fortune in a shipwreck, found consolation in philosophy. He later quipped, \u201cMy most profitable journey began on the day I was shipwrecked and lost my entire fortune.\u201d\n\nWe too can begin such a journey, Holiday says. He says that like us, the Stoics also knew something about dealing with loss, political instability and living in a time when many people felt politically powerless. He cites Aurelius, a Stoic follower who became one of Rome\u2019s greatest emperors. He led Rome during a global pandemic that killed at least 10 million people and grappled constantly with war and murderous political divisions.\n\nPolice officers separate an anti-Trump protestor from a pro-Trump demonstrator as people wait for a verdict in the criminal trial of former President Donald Trump on May 30, 2024, in New York City. Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cAurelius experienced this devastating global pandemic that ravaged society,\u201d says Holiday, who just released \u201cRight Thing, Right Now,\u201d the third installment in his bestselling book series on Stoic virtues. \u201cBut he would have also seen what it [the pandemic] did to people: the tribalism, the fear, the anger along with the flights of fancy. He saw everything that we just saw over the last couple of years.\u201d\n\nCNN talked to Holiday and Massimo Pigliucci, author of \u201cHow to Be a Stoic: Using Ancient Philosophy to Live a Modern Life.\u201d Both authors, through books, videos and podcasts, are two of the most popular modern-day interpreters of Stoicism.\n\nThey offered three pieces of Stoic advice for handling the anxiety of this year\u2019s election.\n\nDon\u2019t let the future destroy the present\n\nIt pays to look ahead in the world of politics. Pollsters predict trends. Pundits gauge the potential impact of political gaffes. Party leaders assess the implications of court decisions. Worry about the future is constant.\n\nThat type of worry, though, spreads like a contagion to voters. People obsess about what will happen to them if the wrong candidate is elected. Some fixate on nightmare scenarios about the country descending into civil war. This grinding anxiety echoes Shakespeare\u2019s famous line from \u201cJulius Caesar\u201d: \u201cA coward dies a thousand times, a hero dies but once.\u201d\n\nStoics only die once, though, because they reject fixating on the future. Stoicism teaches people to separate what they can control from what they cannot. Their advice: don\u2019t become engulfed by nightmare political scenarios that may or may not come to pass.\n\nBestselling author Ryan Holiday attends a conversation at the 92nd Street Y on October 10, 2023, in New York City. Dominik Bindl/Getty Images\n\n\u201cThe Stoics say that he who suffers before it is necessary, suffers more than is necessary,\u201d Holiday says. \u201cThe idea that you should wake up every day in miserable anticipation of a thing that may or may not happen is to punish yourself on top of whatever the pain that will come from that thing actually happening,\u201d Holiday says.\n\nPigliucci says Stoics coped with the political turbulence of their day by focusing on what they could control: their emotions. He cites the Serenity Prayer, which is often recited at 12-step programs. The prayer is attributed to Reinhold Niebuhr, a towering Christian theologian from the 20th century, and asks God to \u201cgrant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeems like excellent advice for the upcoming presidential elections,\u201d Pigliucci says. \u201cHave the courage to do your duty as a citizen; vote, maybe send money or volunteer for a campaign; then accept the outcome because it will be what it will be.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t be too cynical to get involved\n\nMaybe you\u2019ve met this type of person. They don\u2019t vote because they say it won\u2019t make a difference. You might hear them in a barbershop or perched on a barstool, griping. All politicians are corrupt. The Illuminati control everything. Pass me a beer.\n\nSome people deal with the anxiety of the election by checking out of politics altogether. The ancient Athenians had a word for citizens that refused to exercise their right to vote. They called them \u201cidiotai,\u201d from which the word \u201cidiot\u201d is derived.\n\nMany Stoic leaders would never be labeled as \u201cidiotai.\u201d They were passionately involved in politics and the pursuit of justice.\n\nThat may surprise people. Stoics get a bad rap because of the way the way the word is defined: someone \u201cindifferent to pain or pleasure,\u201d not showing \u201cpassion or feeling.\u201d But ancient Stoic leaders would have been at home jousting on Sunday morning political talk shows or marching in a Black Lives Matter protest.\n\nHoliday says Aurelius wrote constantly about justice in his classic book, \u201cMeditations.\u201d\n\nEpictetus, the ancient Greek Stoic and philosopher. Historia/Shutterstock\n\n\u201cHe talks about the common good more than 80 times in \u2018Meditations,\u201d Holiday says. \u201cHe talks about it more than just about anything. He actually says the whole purpose of life is good character and acts for the common good.\u201d\n\nThe stereotype of the dispassionate, uninvolved Stoic is \u201cas wrong as it could possibly be,\u201d Holiday says.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the actual lives of Stoics, these are people who got married, had families, ran for public office and fought for causes,\u201d Holiday says. \u201cThere was a generation of Stoics that were such a perpetual thorn in the side of emperors that they were known as the Stoic Opposition. At one point, all of them are kicked out of Rome because they won\u2019t go along to get along.\u201d\n\nCynicism can be masked cowardice \u2014 some cynics are afraid of the risks that come with getting involved. But the Stoic leaders were known for their courage in standing up to political tyrants. Pigliucci tells a famous story about political courage that centers on Helvidius Priscus, a Stoic philosopher.\n\nWhen the Roman emperor Vespasian threatened Priscus, the Stoic philosopher, with execution for speaking out against political tyranny, Priscus responded by saying:\n\n\u201cWell, when have I ever claimed to you that I\u2019m immortal? You fulfill your role, and I\u2019ll fulfill mine. It is yours to have me killed, and mine to die without a tremor; it is yours to send me into exile, and mine to depart without a qualm.\u201d\n\nBe kind, even to your political enemies\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to be cynical when it comes to US presidential politics. Candidates brazenly lie on the campaign trail. Partisan websites and social media platforms spread so much disinformation that\u2019s hard to know what to believe. Politicians who once loudly opposed certain candidates now bend the knee to curry their favor.\n\nIt\u2019s easy for our dislike for our political opponents to morph into hatred. But Holiday suggests we consider how Aurelius dealt with political treachery in his time. Aurelius survived an attempted coup from his most trusted general. He had unlimited power and could have devised an array of sadistic measures to torment or kill his traitor. But he refused to do so.\n\n\u201cIn fact, he wept when he was deprived of the chance to grant clemency to his former enemy,\u201d Holiday writes in an essay on Aurelius. \u201cThe best revenge, Marcus would write \u201cis to not be like that.\u201d\n\nWhen family or friends insult you or stop talking to you because of a political disagreement, it\u2019s easy to respond in kind. The Stoics, though, have two words of advice, Holiday says:\n\nThis illustration shows Romans praying outside a temple for an end to the Antonine Plague. The epidemic claimed the lives of millions, but the Roman empire survived. Florilegius/Universal Images Group/Getty Images\n\nBe kind.\n\nThat may sound na\u00efve when personal attacks have become the norm in modern-day politics and this year\u2019s presidential race. But Epictetus said that \u201cAny person capable of angering you becomes your master.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Stoics said we should try to see every person we meet as an opportunity for kindness,\u201d Holiday writes in his new book.\n\nHoliday says that when Aurelius was on his deathbed, he had one regret: He was still chastising himself over the times he had had lost his temper and been unkind to others.\n\nHoliday says he\u2019s had to apply that Stoic advice to his own personal life. He has risen in prominence in part because he\u2019s sold a reported 6 million books on Stoicism. He\u2019s also built a mini-empire around Stoicism that includes YouTube videos, an Instagram feed and a Stoic newsletter.\n\nHis elevated public profile has led to some personal challenges. He says he and his family have been constantly harassed because they have taken stands against book banning, in support of women\u2019s rights, and for the removal of Confederate monuments. A friend betrayed him.\n\nHoliday says a younger version of himself would have \u201cwanted blood\u201d for those who have tried to hurt him. Instead he considered the actions of Stoic leaders like Aurelius, drawing a direct link between the \u201cdark energy\u201d that the Stoic leaders faced in their time and what he sees in the 2024 presidential election cycle.\n\n\u201cThere is this energy across all societies that is driven by hatred, fear, and that wants to protect what it has and prevent other people from getting their piece of it,\u201d Holiday tells CNN. \u201cAnd that energy was certainly there in Roman times. \u201c\n\nBut solutions to that dark energy are there, too. Stoic leaders may seem like distant figures encased in marble, but we can learn from them, Holiday says.\n\nThey wrestled with and ultimately defeated the same dark energy that drove the political tribalization of their day. So can we.\n\nJohn Blake is a CNN senior writer and author of the award-winning memoir, \u201cMore Than I Imagined: What a Black Man Discovered About the White Mother He Never Knew.\u201d",

We should not be talking amnesty, we should be talking about stopping the invasion instead,\u201d Trump said.\n\nSome 11 million migrants are living in the US without authorisation, according to estimates by the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nAlthough Trump has directed much of his ire at undocumented migration, he sharply reduced legal immigration during his time in office.\n\nThe Trump administration cut the number of green cards and immigrant visas by 418,453 and 11,178,668, respectively, according to an analysis by the libertarian Cato Institute, although most of the decline was due to restrictions introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDuring his appearance on the All-In Podcast, Trump said the pandemic had disrupted his plans to hand out green cards to foreign graduates.\n\n\u201cI know of stories where people graduate from a top college, or from a college, and they desperately wanted to stay here. They had a plan for a company, a concept and they can\u2019t,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cThey go back to India, they go back to China, they do the same basic company in those places and they become multi-billionaires employing thousands and thousands of people, and it could have been done here.\u201d",

        "text": "Trump campaign gets $50m boost from single donor\nDonald Trump's presidential campaign has received $50m (\u00a339.5m) boost from the conservative billionaire Timothy Mellon, a federal filing showed on Thursday.\n\nThe Super-Pac fund called \"MAGA Inc\" disclosed to the Federal Election Commission that it took in more than $68m from donors last month.\n\nReuters reported that Mr Mellon, an heir of the Pittsburgh-based Mellon banking family, gave $50m. Another $10m came from billionaires Liz and Dick Uihlein.\n\nUS media reported that Mr Mellon sent the donation the day after Trump was convicted on 34 charges of falsifying business records in his New York hush-money trial.\n\nMr Mellon has also been the biggest donor to independent presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr, giving the pro-Kennedy Super-Pac American Values at least $20m.\n\nSuper-Pacs are independent \"political action committees\" that can raise unlimited amounts of money to support an election candidate.\n\nThe Mellon donation has helped pro-Trump allies outspend US President Joe Biden's allies on campaigning in recent weeks.\n\nMr Mellon, who lives in Wyoming and is rarely photographed, is an amateur pilot who has invested in and led transport-related companies.\n\nForbes estimates that the Mellon family is worth around $14.1bn.\n\nMeanwhile, Reuters reported that billionaire Mike Bloomberg has given nearly $20m to Biden-supporting Super-Pacs.\n\nMr Bloomberg's contribution included $19m to an independent pro-Biden group known as Future Forward or FF PAC.\n\nA further $900,000 was given to the Biden Victory Fund, which is an amalgamation of the Biden campaign and Democratic Party committees.\n\nThe Biden campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nOn Thursday, the pro-Kennedy Super-Pac reported that it took in only around $280,000 last month, with none of it coming from Mr Mellon.",

        "text": "Donald Trump and Joe Biden prepare ahead of the first 2024 debate\nTrump and Biden sharpen lines ahead of debate showdown\n\nJoe Biden and Donald Trump both spent the weekend sharpening their lines in preparation for their first 2024 debate - in very different ways.\n\nMr Biden spent his time hunkered down with aides at the Camp David presidential retreat, engaging in mock debates.\n\nDonald Trump spent Saturday on the campaign trail, where he publicly workshopped attack lines and tactics.\n\nThursday\u2019s CNN-hosted debate will mark the third time - though the first in this election cycle - that the Democrat and Republican candidates face-off on stage.\n\nThey ran against each other in 2020 and debated twice that year.\n\nThe Democratic president is preparing with Ron Klain, his former chief of staff, who also helped him get ready for his State of the Union speech in March.\n\nBBC\u2019s US partner CBS News reported that Bob Bauer, who served as White House counsel under former President Barack Obama, is playing the role of Donald Trump in the mock debates with Joe Biden.\n\nOn Sunday, the Biden campaign also said it plans to host hundreds of watch parties and events in battleground US states across to mark the upcoming debate.\n\nAlong with 1,600 events, the campaign said it will run a new batch of TV and digital advertisements in a bid to connect with voters.\n\nThe events will target groups seen crucial to Mr Biden\u2019s re-election, including members of the LGBT community and college students.\n\nAs for the debate itself, Mr Biden\u2019s campaign co-chair hinted on Sunday that one of the strategies will be to attack the Republican rival on his legal troubles and character.\n\n\u201cIt really doesn\u2019t matter how Donald Trump shows up if he comes in unhinged, like he is most of the time, or he sits there and is quiet,\u201d Mitch Landrieu told NBC on Sunday.\n\nMr Landrieu said people will know that he\u2019s a \"convicted felon\" - referring to Trump's recent conviction in the New York hush-money trial - who has been found to have \"defamed somebody, sexually abused somebody\" - referring to his defeat in a civil defamation lawsuit brought against him by writer E Jean Carroll.\n\nMeanwhile, the Republican has forgone traditional debate preparations and has instead been holding a series of meetings in recent weeks with US senators and advisors.\n\nTrump has been reviewing with them at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida the policy points he would like to make during Thursday's showdown.\n\n\u201cHe is thinking about how to translate these really, really important topics into a message that works,\u201d said Republican Senator JD Vance in an interview with Fox News earlier this week.\n\nMr Vance is one of the senators that have met with Trump in recent days, along with Marco Rubio and Eric Schmitt.\n\nAccording to The Hill newspaper, Trump is also discussing how to approach topics like the 6 January 2021 Capitol riot, which Mr Biden has called attack on American democracy.\n\nOn Saturday, the former president held a rally in Philadelphia, where he took aim at Mr Biden, mocking him for his Camp David debate preparations.\n\nAt one point, he asked the crowd if he should be \u201ctough and nasty\u201d towards his rival during the debate, or \u201cbe nice and calm\u201d.",

        "text": "How will immigration change if Trump is re-elected in 2024\nHow will immigration change if Trump is re-elected in 2024\n\nHow Immigration Law would change in the face of a Trump Re-election.\n\nA hot topic which many of our clients have been asking is how to prepare if President Trump is re-elected to a second term. It is no secret that President Trump is not a fan of immigration. In his first term, he tried to limit access to visas for a wide range of people, both legal and illegal. We believe that this trend will mostly continue if he is reelected. Most of the restrictions would be focused on border control and illegal immigration but we do believe that a fair number would also affect legal immigration. Here is a list of issues we have found on various social media sites.\n\nH-1B Visas Would Face New Restrictions\n\nIf Donald Trump is reelected, companies should expect new restrictions on employing foreign-born scientists and engineers in H-1B status. After he took office in 2017, Trump\u2019s immigration policies increased the denial rate for H-1B petition for initial employment (typically new employees counted against the annual H-1B cap) to 24% in FY 2018 and 21% in FY 2019. In 2020, a legal settlement forced USCIS to end several methods of adjudication which were counter to legal adjudication, causing denial rates to plummet to 2% by FY 2022.\n\nH-1B petitions for continuing employment rose to 12% in FY 2018 and FY 2019. Those petitions were usually extensions for existing employees at the same company. The denials caused employees who could not obtain extensions to leave the United States. The legal settlement resulted in H-1B petitions for continuing employment to decline to 2% by FY 2022.\n\nWe believe that Trump officials in a new administration would direct USCIS adjudicators to act more restrictively and as a result, denial rates would increase. Even successful lawsuits could leave employers with the policies in place for years, which happened after Trump officials restricted H-1B petitions in 2017.\n\nIn October 2020, the Trump Department of Labor published a separate interim final rule designed to price most H-1B visa holders out of the U.S. labor market by significantly increasing the required minimum wage. \u201cUnder the new DOL mandated minimum salary, an employer in the San Jose, California area would pay an electrical engineer at Level 4 nearly $85,000 (or 53%) above the market wage, as indicated by a private wage survey, and 54% above the market wage . . . at Level 1,\u201d according to a National Foundation for American Policy. Research shows H-1B restrictions lead to companies sending more jobs, resources and innovations outside the United States. The results demonstrate an important unintended consequence of immigration restrictions: the movement of jobs and talent abroad, with major implications for U.S. competitiveness.\n\nAs president, Donald Trump used the authority in 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act to restrict the entry of immigrants and temporary visa holders. In April 2020, Trump used section 212(f) to issue a proclamation that suspended the entry of immigrants, including employment-based immigrants. Only the spouses and children of U.S. citizens were exempted.\n\nIn June 2020, Trump used his authority to issue a separate proclamation to suspend the entry of H-1B, L-1 and other temporary visa holders. The courts ruled that the proclamation exceeded the president\u2019s authority, but the ruling did not have a significant practical impact because Covid-19 limited visa processing at U.S. consulates. Such proclamations could block future H-1B and L-1 visa holders from entering the United States.\n\nIf Donald Trump wins the 2024 presidential election, employers should expect policies restricting H-1B visa holders and employment-based immigrants. They should also anticipate other policies, such as banning the entry of immigrants and temporary visa holders from many Muslim-majority countries.\n\nOther effects of a Trump re-election include:\n\nUpdates to the annual eligible country lists for H-2A and H-2B temporary worker visas could be suspended. Most populations would thus be excluded from \u201cfilling critical gaps in the agricultural, construction, hospitality, and forestry sectors.\u201d If US citizens live with anyone who is not a US citizen or legal permanent resident, they may be barred from qualifying for federal housing subsidies. States may be forced to share driver\u2019s licenses and taxpayer identification information with federal authorities, or risk critical funding.\n\nWe quote a study that further says that a Trump administration might cut off legal immigration, which includes \u201chigh-skilled and temporary employment, family reunification, and humanitarian protection.\u201d Visa eligibility may be restricted by country. The new administration could suspend the issuance of immigrant visas, nonimmigrant visas, or all visas if a country is categorized as \u201crecalcitrant or uncooperative regarding the receipt of deported nationals.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs of June 2020, 13 countries\u2013including China, Russia, India, Cuba, and Eritrea\u2013are classified as recalcitrant, many of which comprise the largest origin countries for U.S.-based international students, foreign high-skilled workers, or family reunification beneficiaries,\u201d the study says. \u201cLeveraging entire visa categories as collateral in foreign policy negotiations would result in aggressive restrictions on legal immigration. Rather than holding the noncompliant governments responsible, these restrictions would only punish the country\u2019s nationals and the American families, universities, and businesses that rely on them.\u201d\n\nThe study says that these proposals \u201cmark a significant divergence from traditional conservative immigration priorities like promoting merit-based immigration, fostering assimilation, and enhancing interior enforcement,\u201d and could \u201ccripple the existing immigration system.\u201d\n\nIn a recent interview with the former President, we note that he is becoming more militant and more martial in what he is talking about immigration. He is calling for nothing less than the largest deportation in American history. He gave some more details. He specifically used these numbers; 15 to 20 million people is what the former president told \u201cTIME\u201d magazine He said he would use local law enforcement and the military, National Guard, didn\u2019t really get into too many details about that. But he was asked specifically about how that comports with U.S. law, which says the military cannot, in fact, be used to be deployed against civilians. He stated that the illegals in the US aren\u2019t civilians. These are people that aren\u2019t legally in our country. This is an invasion of our country. I can see myself using the National Guard. And, if necessary, I would have to go a step further.\n\nThis is invoking, obviously, martial powers in a way that we haven\u2019t really seen in this issue at all. Now, as for would he have mass detention camps, he said possibly, but he doesn\u2019t think they\u2019re needed. I will say, right now, the U.S. is actually allowing for more bed space for migrant detention.\n\nLegal Immigration\n\nTrump said last year that he would seek to end automatic citizenship for children born in the U.S. to immigrants living in the country illegally, an idea he flirted with as president. Such an action would run against the long-running interpretation of an amendment to the U.S. Constitution and likely trigger legal challenges. During his first term, Trump greatly reduced the number of refugees allowed into the U.S. and has criticized Biden\u2019s decision to increase legal immigration.\n\nINTERESTING DEVELOPMENT\n\nIn a shift from his earlier stance on immigration, former US President Donald Trump has promised to grant automatic green cards to foreign students who graduate from US Colleges. He says this is aimed at preventing them from returning to their home countries. This departure from anti-immigrant rhetoric comes ahead of the November presidential election, where immigration is a key issue.",

Still, the consequences of any presidential election \u2014 not to mention the drama and portents of this particular election \u2014 compel the attention of voters and media alike.\n\nYet it has only been in the last few weeks that many of us have come to focus on the process for choosing the party nominees for vice president. One reason for that is simple: There is no such process. Or at least no process the public can watch.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWe have dozens of primaries and caucuses and spend hundreds of millions of dollars on frantic campaigning for the \u201ctop of the ticket.\u201d By contrast, we spend relatively little or nothing at all on the other half of that ticket.\n\nThat is because the bottom half is simply picked by the top half. The presidential nominee decides on his or her \u201crunning mate\u201d and there is rarely any meaningful resistance to that at the party convention where the nominees become official (thereby securing ballot access in every state).\n\nAt times, the primaries have served up a winner and a runner-up who became the running mate. Such was the case when Sen. John Kerry, the Democratic nominee in 2004, chose fellow Sen. John Edwards for vice president. More often, however, if a nominee has a choice, the pick comes from among primary rivals who finished well back in the pack.\n\nThat was the case when Barack Obama chose Joe Biden in 2008. The two senators from Illinois and Delaware went on to win. But in choosing Biden, Obama passed over another senator, Hillary Clinton of New York, who had given him a long and hard fight for the nomination and nearly equaled him in primary votes.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nEight years later, Clinton herself did much the same in passing over Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the choice of roughly 40% of the delegates at the convention. She chose yet another senator, Tim Kaine of Virginia, who had not entered the primaries.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, when first nominated in 2016, ignored his primary rivals entirely and instead reached out to Mike Pence, then governor of Indiana.\n\nWe have been letting the top dog do the barking for so long now that we scarcely notice anymore. It will be the case again this year, but there is a chance more people will notice. That\u2019s because the lone decider on the Republican side is Trump, a man we can all agree has brought a certain show business flair to politics.\n\n\n\nEnter the showman\n\nTrump knows his running mate choice has become the one truly suspenseful element of the campaign at this phase. And he surely knows how to milk a moment.\n\nIt is possible, if not likely, that he will milk it all the way to Milwaukee next month and have the final four (or some other number) on stage during the convention\u2019s prime time presentation. Perhaps they would each be given a chance to speak. And then, one can imagine, there could be more suspense and dramatic lighting and Trump could lay his hands \u2014 figuratively speaking or not \u2014 on the shoulders of his anointed.\n\nThis may seem over the top or beyond the pale, a takeover of a historic event by reality TV theatrics. Until Bill Clinton showed up midweek in New York in 1992 it was considered poor form for a nominee to even come to the convention hall until the final night for an acceptance speech. Until 1932, when Franklin Roosevelt flew to Chicago to accept his first nomination, nominees did not appear at the convention at all.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut this will not be an ordinary or old-fashioned convention. This will be a Trump show. And if you take a look back at the first night of the Trump convention in Cleveland in 2016 \u2014 at the way lights and music were used to bring him on stage on the very first night \u2014 the notion of an Apprentice-like \u201cgame show\u201d in Milwaukee seems less far-fetched.\n\n\n\nRunning mate criteria and impacts\n\nOur system has long ago absorbed the lesson that vice presidents are chosen largely for effect, despite all the rhetoric about someone being the \u201cmost qualified person\u201d to be \u201ca heartbeat away.\u201d\n\nThe very existence of the vice presidential office has often been viewed rather like an appendix, an afterthought of the Founding Fathers. If it is a kind of flaw in the system, it has most often been addressed by trusting to luck.\n\nWhy don\u2019t Americans seem more interested in who\u2019s in line for the second-ranking job in the federal government?\n\nThe answer has to do with power. Because the vice president of the United States, the No. 2 who would replace a departed, has almost no actual authority under any other circumstances. That\u2019s why its very first occupant, John Adams, called it \u201cthe most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived.\u201d\n\nSubsequent occupants of that relatively colorless office have usually mattered only if they later became president themselves, or if they made some measurable or evident difference to the outcome in the year they were nominated.\n\nInstances of the latter have been few and far between. John F. Kennedy would not have won the Electoral College in 1960 without the state of Texas, and it is hard to see him winning that state without its native son Lyndon Johnson as his running mate. As it was, that ticket only prevailed in the nationwide popular vote by about 100,000.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn 1972, Democratic nominee George McGovern, a senator from South Dakota and leading critic of the Vietnam War, was probably never going to dislodge incumbent President Richard Nixon that fall. But what chance he had was badly damaged when his running mate, Sen. Thomas Eagleton of Missouri, left the ticket after revelations about his electro-shock therapy for depression.\n\nThere have been vice presidential nominees who both helped and hurt. Sarah Palin, then the governor of Alaska, was the first woman on the national ticket in the GOP. She fired up the 2008 convention and drew huge crowds that fall, often upstaging the presidential nominee, Sen. John McCain of Arizona. But in the end, Palin\u2019s lack of experience and problematic media interviews seemed to cost the ticket ground among swing voters.\n\nThere was also substantial excitement in 1984 when a Democratic member of Congress from New York, Geraldine Ferraro, became the first woman named to a national ticket by a major party. But here again, the skyrocket seemed to come to Earth as the summer stretched into fall. And the difficulty of overcoming a popular incumbent, in this case Republican Ronald Reagan, was far too great. The Democrats that year lost 49 states, just as they had in 1972.\n\ntoggle caption Stefani Reynolds/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nWho will it be? And when?\n\nTrump has narrowed his plethora of possibilities to half a dozen \u2014 or a dozen, or eight, depending on which news tease you believe. He says he has a \u201cpretty good idea\u201d who the winner will be. But he also says he will probably wait until the convention for the Big Reveal, telling TV host Phil McGraw: \u201dI think that\u2019s pretty normal.\u201d\n\nWell, yes and no. The No. 2 nominee has usually been known for at least a few news cycles before the convention. It has become almost a tradition for a non-incumbent presidential nominee to use the \u201cone big question\u201d to pique interest in a party gathering that has no other suspense. But it is considered necessary to prepare the media and the delegates a least a little before the event.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThis was the case for current Vice President Kamala Harris in 2020 and for Trump\u2019s No. 2 Pence in 2016, both announced a few days before their debuts on the national ticket. Trump was seen as reaching out to elements of the party that had, like Pence, supported Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (who had yet to endorse Trump at the convention).\n\nBiden announced Harris just his party began its virtual convention in the COVID summer of August 2020. Biden had the nomination amid party peace, but months earlier, Biden had committed to naming a woman to the ticket and shown strong leanings toward a woman of color.\n\nThere is always some speculation about replacing the running mate for a reelection campaign, but there was no serious effort to dislodge either Pence or Harris in their reelection cycle. (Pence, however, fell out with Trump over the certifying of the 2020 election results and, after ending his own bid for the 2024 nomination, has said he would not vote for Trump this fall.)\n\nThe last time a sitting vice president was replaced on the national ticket after a term in office was in 1944. (Franklin Roosevelt, on track to win a fourth term that fall, had a liberal vice president at the time named Henry Wallace. Conservative Southern senators, concerned about FDR\u2019s fragile health, engineered his ouster and replaced him with Sen. Harry Truman of Missouri.)\n\nIn the 80 years and 20 presidential cycles since then, we have seen quite a few vice presidents become the party\u2019s new man at the top of the ticket. That happened while some were still serving as vice president: in 1960 (Richard Nixon), 1968 (Hubert Humphrey), 1988 (George H.W. Bush) and 2000 (Al Gore). And we have also seen vice presidents step up to the presidency in mid-term and run as the incumbent, as the presidential candidate, as happened in 1964 (Johnson) and 1976 (Gerald Ford).\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSeveral vice presidents have left that office and become private citizens and later mounted successful campaigns for the party\u2019s nomination for president, as Joe Biden did in 2020. Walter Mondale did this in 1984 and Nixon did in 1968.\n\n\ufeffOverall, 15 of the 45 people who have served as president were vice presidents first. Nine went straight to the top job due to the death or resignation of the preceding president, and four of those nine went on to be elected to a term on their own.\n\nSeveral of those who ascended to the Oval Office in the 20th century have been among the most memorable White House leaders of the period, including Truman, Johnson and Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nSo whether vice presidential choices seem marginal or turn out to be monumental, they are undeniably among the most consequential decisions ever made in American politics.\n\nWhich makes it all the more surprising that we leave such decisions up to the deliberations and mental gymnastics of a single politician.",

        "text": "Donald Trump proposes \u2018automatic Green Cards\u2019 for Indian graduates amid US Election bid: \u2018Give us ability to import\u2026\u2019\nFormer US President Donald Trump has shifted his stance on immigration ahead of the upcoming US presidential election 2024, proposing \u2018automatic Green Cards\u2019 for foreign students graduating from US colleges. In a podcast interview, Trump expressed support for granting Green Cards as part of diplomas, emphasizing the retention of talent in the United States. He underscored the economic potential lost when highly educated individuals return to their home countries, such as India and China, to start businesses that could otherwise thrive in the US.\n\n\u201cWhat I want to do and what I will do is --you graduate from a college, I think you should get a Green Card automatically as part of your diploma, a Green Card to be able to stay in this country. And that includes junior colleges too,\u201d Trump, 78, said in the \u201cAll-In\u201d podcast.\n\nDonald Trump's remarks came as he was pressed by Calacanis to \u201cpromise us you will give us more ability to import the best and brightest around the world to America.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump also lamented \u201cstories where people graduated from a top college or from a college, and they desperately wanted to stay here, they had a plan for a company, a concept, and they can\u2019t \u2014 they go back to India, they go back to China, they do the same basic company in those places.\n\n\"...and they become multi-billionaires employing thousands and thousands of people, and it could have been done here,\" he said.\n\n\"Let me just tell you that it's so sad when we lose people from Harvard, MIT, from the greatest schools. and lesser schools that are phenomenal schools also. And what I wanted to do, and I would have done this, but then we had to solve the COVID problem because that came in and, you know, sort of dominated for a little while, as you perhaps know,\u201d Trump said in response.\n\nTrump's remarks reflect a departure from his previous anti-immigrant rhetoric, focusing now on a merit-based immigration system to attract and retain skilled individuals. He highlighted the plight of top graduates who struggle to secure US residency, despite their academic achievements and potential contributions to the economy.\n\nDuring his presidency, Donald Trump implemented stringent immigration policies, including restrictions on green cards and visa programs, aimed at reducing legal immigration. He also targeted the H-1B visa program, crucial for tech companies hiring foreign skilled workers, which he criticized as detrimental to American interests.\n\nThe proposal to grant automatic Green Cards to STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) graduates aligns with Donald Trump's renewed emphasis on recruiting and retaining top talent.\n\nTrump's proposals contrast starkly with earlier executive actions, such as the travel ban targeting predominantly Muslim countries and efforts to curtail legal immigration.",

        "text": "Speaking at evangelical Christian conference, Trump endorses Ten Commandments in schools\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump told a group of evangelicals they \u201ccannot afford to sit on the sidelines\u201d of the 2024 election, imploring them at one point to \u201cgo and vote, Christians, please!\u201d\n\nTrump also endorsed displaying the Ten Commandments in schools and elsewhere while speaking to a group of politically influential evangelical Christians in Washington on Saturday. He drew cheers as he invoked a new law signed in Louisiana this week requiring the Ten Commandments to be displayed in every public school classroom.\n\nWATCH: Louisiana\u2019s Ten Commandments law raises new concerns over separation of church and state\n\n\u201cHas anyone read the \u2018Thou shalt not steal\u2019? I mean, has anybody read this incredible stuff? It\u2019s just incredible,\u201d Trump said at the gathering of the Faith & Freedom Coalition. \u201cThey don\u2019t want it to go up. It\u2019s a crazy world.\u2019\u2019\n\nTrump a day earlier posted an endorsement of the new law on his social media network, saying: \u201cI LOVE THE TEN COMMANDMENTS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS, PRIVATE SCHOOLS, AND MANY OTHER PLACES, FOR THAT MATTER. READ IT \u2014 HOW CAN WE, AS A NATION, GO WRONG???\u201d\n\nThe former president and presumptive Republican presidential nominee backed the move as he seeks to galvanize his supporters on the religious right, which has fiercely backed him after initially being suspicious of the twice-divorced New York City tabloid celebrity when he first ran for president in 2016.\n\nThat support has continued despite his conviction in the first of four criminal cases he faces, in which a jury last month found him guilty of falsifying business records for what prosecutors said was an attempt to cover up a hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels just before the 2016 election. Daniels claims she had a sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier, which he denies.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump\u2019s 2024 trials: Where they stand and what to expect\n\nTrump\u2019s stated opposition to signing a nationwide ban on abortion and his reluctance to detail some of his views on the issue are at odds with many members of the evangelical movement, a key part of Trump\u2019s base that\u2019s expected to help him turn out voters in his November rematch with Democratic President Joe Biden.\n\nBut while many members of the movement would like to see him do more to restrict abortion, they cheer him as the greatest champion for the cause because of his role in appointing U.S. Supreme Court justices who overturned national abortion rights in 2022.\n\nTrump highlighted that Saturday, saying, \u201cWe did something that was amazing,\u201d but the issue would be left to people to decide in the states.\n\n\u201cEvery voter has to go with your heart and do what\u2019s right, but we also have to get elected,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile he still takes credit for the reversal of Roe v. Wade, Trump has also warned abortion can be tricky politically for Republicans. For months, he deferred questions about his position on a national ban.\n\nLast year, when Trump addressed the Faith & Freedom Coalition, he said there was \u201ca vital role for the federal government in protecting unborn life\u201d but didn\u2019t offer any details beyond that.\n\nIn April of this year, Trump said he believed the issue should now be left to the states. He later stated in an interview that he would not sign a nationwide ban on abortion if it was passed by Congress. He has still declined to detail his position on women\u2019s access to the abortion pill mifepristone.\n\nAbout two-thirds of Americans say abortion should generally be legal, according to polling last year by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\nAttendees at the evangelical gathering on Saturday said that while they\u2019d like to see a national abortion ban, Trump isn\u2019t losing any of their deep support.\n\n\u201cI would prefer if he would sign a national ban,\u201d said Jerri Dickinson, a 78-year-old retired social worker and Faith & Freedom member from New Jersey. \u201cI understand though, that as in accordance with the Constitution, that decision should be left up to the states.\u201d\n\nDickinson said she can\u2019t stand the abortion law in her state, which does not set limits on the procedure based on gestational age. But she said outside of preferring a national ban, leaving the issue to the state \u201cis the best alternative.\u201d\n\nWATCH: \u2018The Fall of Roe\u2019 looks at players in movement to end abortion and what may be next\n\nJohn Pudner, a 59-year-old who recently started a Faith & Freedom chapter in his home state of Wisconsin, said members of the movement feel loyal to Trump but \u201cwe\u2019d generally like him to be more pro-life.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think a lot, you know, within the pro-life movement feel like, well, gosh, they\u2019re kind of thinking he\u2019s too far pro-choice,\u201d he said. \u201cBut because they appreciate his Supreme Court justices, like that\u2019s a positive within the pro-life community.\u201d\n\nAccording to AP VoteCast, a wide-ranging survey of the electorate, about 8 in 10 white evangelical Christian voters supported Trump in 2020, and nearly 4 in 10 Trump voters identified as white evangelical Christians. White evangelical Christians made up about 20 percent of the overall electorate that year.\n\nBeyond just offering their own support in the general election, the Faith & Freedom Coalition plans to help get out the vote for Trump and other Republicans, aiming to use volunteers and paid workers to knock on millions of doors in battleground states.\n\nTrump on Saturday said evangelicals and Christians \u201cdon\u2019t vote as much as they should,\u201d and joked that while he wanted them to vote in November, he didn\u2019t care if they voted again after that.\n\nHe portrayed Christianity as under threat by what he suggested was an erosion of freedom, law and the nation\u2019s borders.\n\nHe returned several times during his roughly 90-minute remarks to the subject of the U.S.-Mexico border and at one point, when describing migrants crossing it as \u201ctough,\u201d he joked that he told his friend Dana White, the president of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, to enlist them in a new version of the sport.\n\n\u201c\u2018Why don\u2019t you set up a migrant league and have your regular league of fighters. And then you have the champion of your league, these are the greatest fighters in the world, fighting the champion of the migrants,\u2019\u201d Trump described saying to White. \u201cI think the migrant guy might win, that\u2019s how tough they are. He didn\u2019t like that idea too much.\u201d\n\nHis story drew laughs and claps from the crowd.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign responded to Trump\u2019s remarks by saying it was \u201cfitting\u201d that Trump, convicted of a felony, spent time at a religious conference making threats about immigration and \u201cbragging about ripping away Americans\u2019 freedoms.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s incoherent, unhinged tirade showed voters in his own words that he is a threat to our freedoms and is too dangerous to be let anywhere near the White House again,\u201d campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in a statement.\n\nLater Saturday, Trump planned to hold an evening rally in Philadelphia.\n\nAssociated Press writers Tom Strong and Amelia Thomson DeVeaux contributed to this report.",

        "text": "How much do Americans know about the 2024 presidential election?\nThe 2024 presidential election is fast approaching, but are Americans paying attention yet? A new YouGov poll asked Americans whether they are following the election and measured how much they know about the current state of the race. Most Americans (63%) read or hear news about the election at least weekly, but only 35% actively seek out election news. Americans are more likely than not to know that someone has unofficially won each of the major-party presidential nominations, but they are less sure whether the Democratic vice presidential candidate has (33%) or has not (38%) been announced (she has). Most Americans (86%) know that Donald Trump has been on trial for a crime in 2024, but 25% incorrectly thought he had already been convicted of a crime \u2014 according to a poll conducted weeks before he was. How much do Americans know about the election? Most Americans (61%) know that the Republican Party controls the House of Representatives, and a similar proportion (60%) know that the Democratic Party controls the Senate. For each chamber, about 40% of Americans either think it is controlled by the opposite party or are unsure which party controls it. For example, 20% of Americans are unsure which party controls the House, and 19% think the Democrats control the House. Americans with college degrees are more likely than those without one to correctly identify which party controls each chamber. 72% of Americans with college degrees know that Democrats control the Senate, compared to 54% of those without college degrees. The knowledge gap about control of the House is about as large between Americans with and without college degrees.\n\nMost Americans (54%) know that someone has unofficially won the Republican nomination for president, and 51% know that someone has unofficially won the Democratic nomination. For each party, about 20% of Americans do not think the party has unofficially selected nominees; others named someone else or said they were unsure. Large majorities of Americans who know that each party has unofficial nominees correctly identify Donald Trump (82%) and Joe Biden (84%) as those nominees. Americans are more certain about the 2024 Republican vice presidential candidate. Most (66%) know that the 2024 Republican vice presidential candidate has not been selected yet, and only 8% think the party already has chosen one. On the other hand, few Americans correctly say that the 2024 Democratic vice presidential candidate has been announced (33%), and 38% of Americans do not think the Democrats have announced their vice presidential candidate yet. Most Americans who think the Democrats have selected a vice presidential nominee correctly name Vice President Kamala Harris as the nominee (88%). Only 55% of Americans know that the Democratic National Convention has not happened yet, and the same proportion know that the Republican National Election has not happened. In each case, about 40% of Americans don\u2019t know whether the convention has happened yet.\n\nMost Americans (86%) know that Trump has been on trial for a crime in 2024. But 25% of Americans incorrectly thought Trump had been convicted of a crime in 2024 weeks before he was. Democrats (31%) and Independents (30%) were much more likely than Republicans (15%) to think Trump had been convicted of a crime before his actual conviction. Most Americans (54%) correctly think that Trump has been impeached, while 31% do not think he has ever been impeached. (Part of this low figure may be due to how impeachment is defined: Trump was impeached twice by the House but was not convicted either time by the Senate). Democrats (64%) are more likely than Independents (51%) and Republicans (47%) to know Trump has been impeached. Majorities of Americans know that Biden has not been on trial for a crime in 2024 (84%), has never been impeached (86%), and has not been convicted of a crime in 2024 (84%). Independents are more likely than Democrats and Republicans to be unsure about these questions. For example, 18% of Independents are not sure whether Biden has ever been impeached, compared to 7% of Democrats and 8% of Republicans.\n\nDespite their uncertainty about whether Trump has been convicted of a crime and about the current Democratic vice presidential nominee, Americans have a good idea of the policies supported by Democrats and Republicans. Majorities of Americans know that the Democratic Party is more supportive than the Republican Party of expanding government-subsidized health care (72%), strengthening gun control laws (72%), and using regulation to address climate change (71%). 57% know all three. Also, majorities know that the Republican Party is more supportive of making immigration controls strict (74%) and increasing restrictions on abortion (73%). 64% know both. There is more uncertainty around party positions on cutting taxes. Most Americans see the Republican Party as more supportive of tax cuts (54%), but 22% see the Democrat Party as more supportive.\n\nAre Americans following the election? 31% of Americans are paying \u201ca lot\u201d of attention to the 2024 presidential election, and another 32% are paying \u201csome\u201d attention to it. 13% are not paying any attention to the election. A slim majority (54%) care \u201ca great deal\u201d about who wins the 2024 presidential election, while only 6% do not care at all about who wins. Most Americans read or hear news about the 2024 presidential election daily (36%) or weekly (28%). Another 10% engage with election news once or twice a month, while 22% read or hear election news less than that or never. Republicans (43%) are more likely than Democrats (34%) and Independents (31%) to see election news daily. Americans are less likely to discuss the election than they are to hear news about it. Only 12% discuss the election with friends or family daily, while 26% do so weekly. 22% of Americans discuss the election less than once or twice a month and 18% never discuss it. Like with news consumption, Republicans (48%) are more likely than Democrats (36%) and Independents (31%) to discuss the election daily or weekly.\n\nWhen it comes to news about the election, about one-third of Americans (35%) actively seek it out, while 16% actively avoid it. Half of Americans (49%) do neither. Older Americans are more likely than younger Americans to actively seek out election news: 49% of Americans 65 and older actively seek out election news, compared to only 24% of adults under 30. Americans 65 and older also are much less likely than younger adults to avoid election news. Adults under 30 are more likely than other age groups to neither seek out nor avoid election news.\n\nAbout half of Americans (49%) have consumed election-related news from television in the last month, while 46% have gotten election news from social media and 37% have gotten it from friends, family, or colleagues. News websites (34%) and apps (33%) are also popular sources of election information. Adults under 30 are more likely than older Americans to get election news from social media. On the other hand, one-quarter (25%) of Americans 65 and older have gotten election news from print newspapers or magazines in the last month, compared to about 10% in other age groups.",

Here\u2019s what you need to know\n\ntoggle caption Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images; Carlos Osorio/AP\n\nPresident Biden and former President Donald Trump will face off in the first presidential debate of the 2024 general election tonight in Atlanta.\n\nIt begins a new phase of the presidential race, less than five months out from Nov. 5, Election Day, as the matchup remains extremely tight. Biden and Trump stand virtually tied, according to the latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll, which echoes a months-long trend of recent national surveys.\n\nThe debate also breaks with campaign tradition, occurring months earlier than usual and with a new set of rules both candidates have agreed to, including no live audience. It\u2019s also the first debate either candidate has participated in this campaign season. Biden largely ran unopposed, and Trump notably skipped the GOP primary debates.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about this first debate.\n\n\n\nWhen and how to watch\n\nThe event starts at 9 p.m. ET and will run for 90 minutes. It will be moderated by CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper and Dana Bash and take place at the network\u2019s studios in Atlanta.\n\nThe debate will be available on CNN and the streaming platform Max, formerly known as HBO. Viewers without a cable login can watch on CNN\u2019s website.\n\nNPR will be providing live on-air special coverage of the CNN Presidential Debate Simulcast. Plus, you can follow NPR\u2019s live blog for updates and analysis during the debate.\n\n\n\nWho will be there?\n\nBiden and Trump are the only presidential candidates who qualified for the debate stage.\n\nIndependent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. failed to meet the threshold, which required candidates to poll at 15% or higher in four national surveys and appear on enough state ballots that could theoretically push them past the needed 270 Electoral College votes to secure the presidency.\n\n\n\nHow is this debate different from those in the past?\n\nTypically, presidential debates occur in front of a live audience, often in an event space on a college or university campus, and are coordinated by the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD).\n\nBut not this year. Both candidates have said they will not participate in the CPD\u2019s previously scheduled and announced debates, lobbying for earlier matchups.\n\nInstead, Biden and Trump will take part in tonight\u2019s debate on CNN and then a second in September hosted by ABC News.\n\nBiden and Trump have agreed to the following rules:\n\n\n\nMicrophones will be muted unless a candidate is directed to speak.\n\nCandidates are not allowed to bring prewritten notes or props. They will receive a pen and paper, as well as a bottle of water.\n\nA coin toss determined podium positions and the order of closing statements. According to CNN, Biden\u2019s campaign won the coin toss and chose the podium to the viewers' right. As a result, the Trump team chose to deliver the final closing statement of the evening.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWhat to watch for\n\nCandidates will likely speak to recent respective legal dramas. The debate comes about a month after Trump was found guilty of 34 criminal charges in New York, becoming the first U.S. president in history to be convicted of felony crimes. Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, who is not running for office, was convicted on felony gun charges in Delaware in mid-June and faces a second federal trial in September over failing to pay his taxes.\n\nBiden will also likely address concerns over his age and ability to serve a second term. At 81, he is the oldest sitting president in U.S. history, and if elected for a second term, he would exit office at 86.\n\nWhile the president has had public slipups throughout his first term, Trump, who is 78, has repeatedly criticized Biden\u2019s mental ability, most recently speculating he should take a cognitive test. In that same speech, Trump incorrectly named the doctor who conducted his own cognitive exam while president.\n\nOn the issues, it\u2019s expected the candidates will discuss the state of the economy and immigration policy, as both are consistently top issues for voters in national polling. It\u2019s also possible the candidates will weigh in on international politics, given voters remain divided on whether the U.S. should be sending military aid to Ukraine and Israel in their respective wars.\n\nThe debate may also be an opportunity for Biden to address his decreasing support, when compared to 2020, among key parts of his base, notably Blacks and Latinos and young voters.\n\nTrump is losing some ground among older voters, and the Biden campaign is trying to capitalize on that. Plus, the former president may still need to repair relations with Nikki Haley supporters who remain uncertain about backing him again.\n\n\n\nWhat's next?\n\nTrump will likely announce his pick for vice president in the coming weeks. There will also be a vice presidential debate this summer. The date has not been finalized, but Vice President Harris agreed to one held on either July 23 or Aug. 13.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nOn the legal front, Trump will appear for sentencing in his criminal trial on July 11, just days before the Republican National Convention, which begins on July 15 in Milwaukee. A month later, the Democratic National Convention will kick off on Aug. 19 in Chicago.\n\nTrump and Biden will debate for a second time on Sept. 10.",

        "text": "What can polls tell us in 2024?\nIf there is one thing Americans can count on during any presidential election year, it\u2019s the constant commentary about polls. But how has polling changed in the digital age? How accurately can polls predict election outcomes? What purpose do they serve?\n\nJohn Lapinski, the Robert A. Fox Leadership Professor of Political Science and director of the Robert A. Fox Leadership Program and the Penn Program on Opinion Research and Election Studies (PORES), addresses these questions. Lapinski also directs the Elections Unit at NBC News, where he is responsible for projecting races for the network and producing election-related stories through exit polls.\n\n\u201cThere have been misses with polling recently,\u201d Lapinski admits. \u201cIs it critically important that people have a sense of who may or may not win an election before election night? I don\u2019t think so, but it is important, given that we live in an electoral democracy, that we have some way of measuring public opinion; otherwise, the people elected to represent us won\u2019t know what we want.\u201d\n\nLapinski notes that polling has changed dramatically over the decades. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen big differences in response rates when using online methods versus telephone. There are differences in subgroups within a population, and it\u2019s very pronounced with younger people,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing a huge experiment right now at PORES, running five different surveys, including telephone interviews with both landline and cellphone interviews, a text survey, and two different online methods.\u201d\n\nIn general, Lapinski says, polls can\u2019t predict turnout. However, \u201cone of the beautiful aspects of election polls is that you can determine whether they\u2019re accurate or not because elections happen. Here\u2019s what the poll said, here\u2019s what the results said.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s election, he adds, will be \u201csuper close.\u201d\n\nThis story is by Jane Carroll.

        "text": "Russia-Linked CopyCop Expands to Cover US Elections, Target Political Leaders\nInsikt Group's report reveals that CopyCop, a likely Russian government-aligned influence network, has shifted its focus to the 2024 US elections. Using AI and inauthentic websites, CopyCop creates and spreads political content. The network registered 120 new websites between May 10 and May 12, 2024, amplifying targeted content through platforms like YouTube. Despite a focus shift to US elections, CopyCop's AI-generated content has seen limited social media amplification.\n\nRussia-Linked CopyCop Expands to Cover US Elections, Target Political Leaders\n\nOn May 9, 2024, Insikt Group published an initial report on CopyCop, a likely Russian government-aligned influence network. CopyCop uses inauthentic websites and generative artificial intelligence (AI) to create and spread political content. Between May 10 and May 12, 2024, the network registered 120 new websites using similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). CopyCop has shifted its focus primarily to the 2024 United States (US) presidential election, disseminating targeted content through YouTube videos aimed at political leaders in France, Ukraine, and the European Union (EU).\n\nCopyCop has expanded its sources for influence content to include mainstream news outlets in the US and UK, conservative-leaning US media, and Russian state-affiliated media. Within 24 hours of the original articles being posted, CopyCop scrapes, modifies, and disseminates them to US election-themed websites using over 1,000 fake journalist personas. Despite the rapid content generation, the AI-generated content has seen limited amplification on social media.\n\nThe network has adapted to recent scrutiny by moving its infrastructure to US-based hosts, likely to minimize Russian government connections. Additionally, fewer traces of generative AI use indicate an attempt to obscure the use of large language models (LLMs).\n\nKey Findings\n\nCopyCop now targets the 2024 US elections, reducing content on other topics like Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine and domestic politics in France and the UK.\n\nCopyCop registered 120 new websites between May 10 and May 12, 2024, focusing on US elections.\n\nThe network uses AI-generated content and fake journalist personas to spread modified articles from mainstream and conservative-leaning US media, as well as Russian state-affiliated outlets.\n\nNew French-themed and US election websites are publishing targeted, likely human-crafted content.\n\nAs of early June 2024, CopyCop's new AI-generated content has seen little to no amplification on social media.\n\nOver 1,000 distinct author profiles and LLM-generated text in article headlines indicate extensive use of AI.\n\nMitigations\n\nUse Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud to track and summarize emerging narratives across CopyCop websites.\n\nMonitor the spread of CopyCop content on social media and messaging platforms like Telegram.\n\nNews organizations should track and counteract plagiarized content to safeguard their reputation.\n\nUtilize Recorded Future Brand Intelligence to identify and address typosquatting domains and infringing content.\n\nInfluence networks using generative AI, like CopyCop, are likely to become more prominent ahead of the 2024 US elections, although they may not gain significant attention initially. Amplification of CopyCop content by existing influence networks is helping bring its content to existing audiences. Once these websites have established persistence, CopyCop will likely publish more targeted content hidden among the high volume of AI-generated content, making them harder to identify and parse out. To mitigate the impact, public organizations, news entities, and AI providers should proactively enforce sanctions, intellectual property laws, and terms of service before these networks gain traction and influence.\n\nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.",

        "text": "Political scientist Corey Brettschneider on the promise of \u2018We the People\u2019\nPROVIDENCE, R.I. [Brown University] \u2014 Is American democracy at risk? In a polarized political moment, scholars, pundits and politicians alike have been raising that question, citing as evidence examples ranging from voter suppression to the violent Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and its aftermath.\n\nIn his forthcoming book, \u201cThe Presidents and the People: Five Leaders who Threatened Democracy and the Citizens Who Fought to Defend It,\u201d Corey Brettschneider, a Brown professor of political science, places the politics of today in the context of history, describing and analyzing five examples from the past when presidents \u201cpushed the boundaries of the Constitution,\u201d he said.\n\nDrawing on moments from the presidencies of John Adams, James Buchanan, Andrew Johnson, Woodrow Wilson and Richard Nixon, Brettschneider argues that citizen movements played an essential role in fighting back against presidential abuses of power and notes that those efforts offer a roadmap for people concerned that the United States has lost its way.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just a book about history,\u201d Brettschneider said. \u201cIt\u2019s a book with a point about the fragility of democracy at this point and the need to inspire the country as a whole to stand up and reclaim our democracy as citizens did in the past.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Presidents and the People\u201d will be published on Tuesday, July 2. Brettschneider, the author of several prior books, including 2018\u2019s \u201cThe Oath and the Office: A Guide to the Constitution for Future Presidents,\u201d shared insights about American democracy, the upcoming presidential election, and citizen engagement in the past and present.\n\nQ: What inspired this particular scholarly focus, and how did you develop the topic for your book?\n\nWhen Donald Trump first ran for president in 2016, I wrote a piece for Politico titled \u201cTrump vs. the Constitution: A Guide.\u201d It had a simple idea behind it, which was that Trump was proposing things that were obvious violations of the U.S. Constitution \u2014 for instance, to torture the families of suspected terrorists, or the total shutdown of Muslim immigration to the U.S.\n\nThe main point of my piece was that the Constitution has rights in it, and it has limits based on the rule of law \u2014 the president isn\u2019t entitled to do anything he or she wants. As a result of that, I received an offer from a publisher to turn it into a much broader piece about the duties of a Constitution-abiding president, which became the book \u201cThe Oath and the Office.\u201d It was meant to be a rebuke to a lot of Trump\u2019s proposals, as well as a guide for future presidents.\n\nWhen Trump won the presidency, he unfortunately did a lot of things he said he was going to do. What I\u2019m trying to do in this book is ask a different question, which is: What are the real checks that people have used in the past, and that we could use now, to stop a president who disregards the Constitution? I wanted to look not just to the ideals of the Constitution and our future, but to actual examples from the past.\n\nOne key takeaway is that, unfortunately, it isn\u2019t the traditional checks on presidential power that we learn about in civics classes that have tended to work. It isn\u2019t the courts, and it isn\u2019t necessarily Congress. Instead, the thing that\u2019s worked is our citizens restoring democracy by organizing around a democratic ideal in the Constitution. We\u2019ve had crisis presidents before, and we\u2019ve recovered as a nation through citizen activism.\n\nQ: How can Americans look to history to further their understanding of the current political climate?\n\nHistory can give us hope that moments of crisis can be overcome. The first example from the book describes when John Adams signs and insists on the implementation of the Sedition Act in 1798, which essentially made it a crime to criticize the president of the United States but allowed for criticism of the vice president, who at the time was Thomas Jefferson. This was really a partisan piece of legislation aimed at shutting down the opposition party. And you would think: Well what about the Supreme Court? They\u2019re supposed to enforce the First Amendment guarantee of free speech, and this is an obvious violation of the right to free speech. But instead, the newspaper editors who were prosecuted under the act used their own trials to try to put Adams on trial. They highlighted the idea that the newly passed First Amendment right to free speech was being trampled on and reclaimed the idea of the First Amendment as a right to criticize a president, or a right to dissent. They turned the election of 1800 into a kind of referendum on democracy.\n\nQ: Donald Trump is the first American president to be convicted of felony crimes, but is there a historical precedent for some of the other concerns you\u2019ve raised about his consideration of the Constitution?\n\nThere are parts of the current Trump crisis of democracy that are precedented and some that strike me as unprecedented. As I describe it, the presidency has always been a danger \u2014 that\u2019s baked into the system. We\u2019ve seen in the presidencies of James Buchanan, Woodrow Wilson and Richard Nixon attempts to subvert the Constitution in the same way that Trump has. But in some ways those presidents were more sophisticated in their assaults because, unlike him, they offered rationales for what they were doing in terms of law.\n\nWhat\u2019s unique about Trump in a historical context is that the previous presidents didn\u2019t come back after their crises of democracy. The difference is that on Jan. 6, 2021, Trump directly threatened democracy in an attempt at self-coup, but far from disappearing, he\u2019s running for a reprise of his threat to democracy. And he doesn\u2019t mince words about what he\u2019s trying to do, including the prosecution of his political opponents, which I view as dangerous.\n\nAs I write in the book, the 18th-century revolutionary hero Patrick Henry called it out from the beginning, saying there\u2019s a danger of a criminal president undermining the republic. His warning is really frightening because he says that such a president is going to realize that there are few checks on his power. In some quarters, Trump\u2019s recent conviction has only made him grow stronger among his supporters. That seems to be to be a very direct parallel with Nixon in some ways, but more frightening in that Trump didn\u2019t disappear and return to private life like Nixon did.\n\nQ: Stepping back from current events and looking at the bigger picture, how do you define American democracy?\n\nI argue that American democracy is not only about having one\u2019s vote counted. It also requires three pillars: The first is the freedom to dissent from government policy, independently or through an opposition party. The second is equal citizenship \u2014 the guarantee that legal and political rights cannot be denied on the basis of race or ethnicity. And the last one is adherence to the rule of law for all, which means that the president cannot be a dictator who is able to commit crimes with impunity.\n\nQ: How might your perspective inform Americans as they consider the upcoming 2024 elections?\n\nOne of the main things that I\u2019m arguing is that right now we don\u2019t have a clear Constitutional constituency, or group, nor a clear leadership voice, that\u2019s demanding the restoration of a democratic Constitution. One of the reasons I wrote the book is that in this moment, more than ever, we\u2019re facing the possibility of the collapse of the republic. So it\u2019s incumbent on us to try to find that voice, and to find leaders who are going to tie their leadership to the fundamental democratic ideals.\n\nWe have an election in which one candidate is pledging to destroy democracy and another is pledging to restore it. However, we have to think not just about this current election, but about what it means to restore democracy in a broad sense. For example, I would love to see President Biden talk about the idea that we need another independent-prosecutor law, like the one that President Carter signed and that existed until President Clinton saw to it that it expired, where an independent prosecutor is not subject to firing by the president. That would help ensure that presidents, regardless of party, can be held to account if they violate the law.\n\nQ: In U.S. history, when presidents \u201cpushed the boundaries of the Constitution\u201d as you describe it, what did citizens do to help protect democracy?\n\nWhen we look to the past, what people did over and over in these moments of crisis was to organize into groups that fought for the restoration of democracy, and to speak out together in favor of these ideals. They criticized those who threatened democracy directly \u2014 in places like meetings, conventions and in newspapers. And they sought to defend democracy by invoking the Constitution, reclaiming it from authoritarian presidents. Our media landscape has changed a lot over the course of American history, but today people can do that on social media. They can also speak to their family and friends and make the idea of the restoration and defense of democracy the central thing we\u2019re talking about for the next few months, and not see this as a normal election.\n\n",

Some of the analysis in this report is based on a survey of 8,638 adults from May 13 to 19, 2024. Everyone who took part in these surveys is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology. Here are the questions used for the report and its methodology.\n\nWhile the economy, immigration and abortion have emerged as major issues in the 2024 election, Joe Biden and Donald Trump also have dramatically different ideas about the size and role of government.\n\nThese differences reflect decades-old divisions between Democrats and Republicans over the scope of government.\n\nAmong registered voters, large majorities of Biden supporters \u2013 roughly three-quarters or more \u2013 favor a bigger, more activist government.\n\n74% say they would rather have a bigger government providing more services.\n\n76% say government should do more to solve problems.\n\n80% say government aid to the poor \u201cdoes more good than harm.\u201d\n\nTrump supporters, by comparable margins, take the opposing view on all three questions.\n\nThe Pew Research Center survey of 8,709 adults \u2013 including 7,166 registered voters \u2013 conducted April 8-14, 2024, examines Americans\u2019 views of the role and scope of government, the social safety net and long-term trends in trust in the federal government.\n\nDemocratic support for bigger government is little changed in the last five years but remains higher than it was a decade ago. Republicans\u2019 views have shifted less over the last 10 years.\n\nAmong all adults, about three-quarters of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents favor a bigger government, up from about six-in-ten in 2014 and 2015. The share of Republicans and Republican leaners who prefer a bigger government has increased only modestly over the same period.\n\nDemocratic support for bigger government, while slightly lower than in 2021 (78%), remains at nearly its highest level in five decades. During Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency in the 1990s, fewer than half of Democrats said they preferred a bigger government with more services.\n\nVoters continue to express very different views about government\u2019s role in specific areas than about the government generally.\n\nA large majority of voters (80%) \u2013 including 82% of Biden supporters and 78% of Trump supporters \u2013 say that in thinking about the long-term future of Social Security, benefits should not be reduced in any way.\n\nHowever, Biden supporters are more likely than Trump supporters to say Social Security should cover more people with greater benefits.\n\n46% of Biden supporters favor expanding Social Security coverage and benefits, compared with 28% of Trump supporters.\n\nMost Americans (65%) continue to say the federal government has a responsibility to make sure all Americans have health care coverage.\n\nDemocrats overwhelmingly (88%) say the federal government has this responsibility, compared with 40% of Republicans.\n\nThe share of Republicans who say the government has a responsibility to provide health coverage has increased 8 percentage points since 2021, from 32% to 40%.\n\nThere are wide income differences among Republicans in opinions about the government\u2019s role in health care:\n\n56% of Republicans with lower family incomes say the government has a responsibility to provide health coverage for all, compared with 36% of those with middle incomes and 29% of higher-income Republicans.\n\nWhen asked how the government should provide health coverage, 36% of Americans say it should be provided through a single national program, while 28% say it should be through a mix of government and private programs. These views have changed little in recent years.\n\nDemocrats continue to be more likely than Republicans to favor a \u201csingle payer\u201d government health insurance program (53% vs. 18%).\n\nOther key findings in this report",

        "text": "America's new generation gap: Young voters say they'll inherit a more challenging world. But will they vote in it?\nCBS News poll: Young voters say they'll inherit a more challenging world. But will they vote?\n\nIt's actually not all ok, Boomers \u2014 at least not in the eyes of America's youngest voters.\n\nMany under 30 believe their elders are leaving them a more dangerous world, with a worse environment and less opportunity.\n\nThese young voters are a more diverse group than older generations and in contrast to America's oldest voters, they think politics would be better with more of that diversity, too.\n\nThey've already faced challenges. They were disrupted by COVID: the youngest of them were in high school or college during the lockdowns and now say their education was interrupted by it. And to a far greater degree than older generations, many also look back and describe growing up with concerns of gun violence.\n\nToday, they overwhelmingly feel it's become harder to buy a house (current interest rates would suggest they're right), to raise a family, to get what they consider to be a good job (this, despite the strong national jobs numbers) or to start a business than it was for generations before them.\n\nBut most do remain hopeful about reaching the American Dream some day, and they're making their own path en route: Today, they describe their generation as \"creative,\" followed by words like \"innovative\" and \"diverse\" \u2014 all qualities most think will help them eventually change the world.\n\nTheir focus is on different issues from their elders' too, with more on climate, abortion and promoting that diversity.\n\nYet for all those concerns \u2014 or maybe because of them \u2014 they aren't planning to vote as much as their elders. They're thinking less about the election right now, and fewer of them say they'll definitely vote than their older counterparts.\n\nSo the extent to which they do or don't participate in '24 could be the most immediate way they'll shape the future for us all.\n\nOn diversity\n\nMajorities of voters under thirty think politics would be better with more diversity: More minorities, more women in office and (perhaps unsurprisingly) more young people.\n\nThere are big differences comparing these views to those over 65, far fewer of whom think politics would be better with that diversity \u2014 and who grew up in a very different and less diverse America.\n\nHow age of the candidates factors in the campaign\n\nTalking about young voters sets up a natural contrast with the age of this year's candidates \u2014 which for some of these young voters marks a fifty-year or greater gap in ages \u2014 and how that affects their views.\n\nHalf of these younger voters feel the candidates' respective ages \u2014 President Biden and former President Donald Trump's \u2014 make them out of touch.\n\nHalf of them say neither presidential candidate understands younger people \u2026 and most importantly, when they feel that, they're relatively less likely to want to vote.\n\nThe big question: Turnout\n\nThey have critiques and issues, but will they show up? The answer, at least on their stated intent from here, is not as much as their elders.\n\nIn fact, among those who did vote in 2020, only three-quarters say they'll definitely do so again this time.\n\nThat's a higher churn rate than for other age groups.\n\nHistorically, younger voters don't vote as much as older voters do, so that's not unique to this younger generation now \u2014 it's often about people's life stage, putting down roots in a community, developing habits of voting, getting involved or just having more time to follow politics as one gets older.\n\nThat said, just one in five young people feel their generation has a lot of say in the political process \u2014 even while at the same time, many of them aren't likely to vote.\n\nJust a third are thinking a lot about the presidential race right now.\n\nWhen asked for the reasons why they won't vote, responses include that it doesn't appeal to them, they don't have time or that the whole system is bad.\n\nYoung people are more disappointed with their choices in this race than the oldest age groups are.\n\nBut here's another difference. Older voters will vote regardless of whether they're satisfied with the candidate choice; they do so out of a sense of long-standing habit, party allegiance or duty.\n\nBut for younger voters, a lot of whom aren't satisfied with the choices they have, candidate satisfaction matters more. When they aren't satisfied with the candidates, they aren't as apt to show up.\n\nA wider range of issues that matter\n\nFor voters under 30, the economy is a major factor in their vote, as it is for all voters, but they're more likely to also include other issues in their calculus, such as abortion, climate, and issues of race and diversity \u2014 all of which accrue to a Biden vote.\n\nTheir percentage support today is not much different from 2020 either, though the turnout factor looms for their impact on Mr. Biden. Right now, young Democrats express comparably less likelihood of turning out than young Republicans.\n\nBy comparison, issues that Trump does well on with older voters \u2014 crime, immigration \u2014 are comparably less important to younger people.\n\n(We should note, they're voting for Mr. Biden when they say diversity is a top issue, but a substantial portion of them still think he hasn't gone far enough promoting it, so it's not that they're completely satisfied with the president.)\n\nEconomy, opportunity and the American dream\n\nViews of today's economy for them seem connected to ideas of opportunity, not just day-to-day finances.\n\nWhen young people think they can attain the American Dream (as most of them do, despite all their perceived challenges) they're relatively more likely to call today's economy good. When they can't see getting the Dream, they say the economy today is bad.\n\n(Notable for larger context, too: young people, still full of optimism, mostly think they can reach the American Dream, and most older voters over 65 think they have; it's actually people in between, in their prime working years today, who are most pessimistic about reaching it.)\n\nGuns\n\nMost say they grew up concerned about the possibility of gun violence when they were in school, a level of concern far higher than older voters express looking back.\n\nThat seems to impact their stances on gun policy. A majority support stricter laws covering the sale of guns, and that support is even higher among those who grew up concerned about gun violence.\n\nStudent loans\n\nAnd they're big fans of canceling student loan debt. (Biden gets big backing from those who do.)\n\nBut is it a motivator on its own? That's less clear. Those who approve of it are no more likely to say they'll turn out than people in the age group, overall.\n\nWar\n\nDespite the attention over recent months and protests on college campuses, for the wider under-30 group, the war between Israel and Hamas ranks well below the economy, abortion, and many other issue factors.\n\nHowever, they do feel very differently about it than older Americans, with relatively more of them calling for a stop to Israel's military action.\n\nClimate\n\nThey're more likely to say climate change needs action now.\n\nAbortion\n\nIf the Biden camp wants to motivate turnout along abortion lines, they may have some work to do:\n\nMost younger voters want abortion to be legal \u2014 as do most voters overall \u2014 but they're less likely than older Americans to think Biden would try to pass a national law legalizing it, and more likely than their elders to be unsure what he'd do.\n\nThey're also more apt to think Trump would do nothing, or to be unsure what Trump would do.\n\nThis CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,460 U.S. adults interviewed between June 17-21, 2024. The survey included an oversample of adults age 18-29 for a total of 743 adults in that age group. The final sample as reported was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as to 2020 presidential vote. The margin of error for the total sample is \u00b12.8 points. The margin of error for the sample of adults 18-29 is \u00b15.2 points.",

        "text": "Message for U.S. Citizens: Celebrate Democracy this 4th of July by Ensuring You Are Prepared to Vote in the 2024 U.S. Election\nMessage for U.S. Citizens: Celebrate Democracy and Vote in the 2024 Election\n\nMessage to U.S. Citizens: Celebrate Democracy this 4th of July by Ensuring You Are Prepared to Vote in the 2024 U.S. Election\n\nLocation: Germany\n\nEvent: Overseas Voting in 2024 U.S. Elections\n\nTo vote in the November 2024 election, U.S. citizens overseas need to have completed a Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) in 2024. Whether you are a first-time voter or have already received ballots and voted absentee in past elections, you must complete an FPCA each calendar year to ensure you can participate in elections as an overseas absentee voter.\n\nEven if you have never voted while overseas before, the process is easy.\n\n1. Request your ballot. Complete a new Federal Post Card Application (FPCA). You must complete a new FPCA after January 1, 2024, to ensure you receive your ballot for the 2024 elections. Submitting the FPCA allows you to request absentee ballots for all elections for federal offices (President, U.S. Senate, and U.S. House of Representatives) including primaries and special elections during the calendar year in which it is submitted. All local election officials in all U.S. states and territories accept the FPCA.\n\nYou can complete the FPCA online at FVAP.gov. The online voting assistant will ask you questions specific to your state. We encourage you to request your blank ballots be delivered electronically (by email, internet download, or fax, depending on your state). Include your email address on your FPCA to take advantage of the electronic ballot delivery option. Return the FPCA per the instructions on the website. The online voting assistant will tell you if your state allows the FPCA to be returned electronically or if you must submit a paper copy with original ink signature. If you must return a paper version, please follow the same instructions below for returning your ballot.\n\n2. Receive and complete your ballot. States are required to send out ballots 45 days before a regular election for federal office and generally send ballots at least 30 days before primary elections. For most states, you can confirm your registration and ballot delivery online.\n\n3. Return your completed ballot. While some states allow you to return your completed ballot electronically, others do not. If your state requires you to return paper voting forms or ballots to local election officials, you can do so free of charge at the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate. Place your ballot in a postage-paid return envelope (this template can be printed on or affixed to any envelope), or in an envelope bearing sufficient domestic U.S. postage, and address it to the relevant local election officials. You can also return your FPCA or ballot to your local election officials via international mail or professional courier service at your own expense.\n\nYou can always get voting assistance from the embassy/consulate or drop off your completed voting forms and ballots, addressed to your local election officials, during the following hours:\n\n\u00b7 Embassy Berlin:\n\nU.S. Citizens wishing to drop off ballots can do so at the H\u00fcttenweg entrance (Clayallee 170, 14195 Berlin) of the U.S. Embassy building located in Dahlem between the hours of 1300-1500, Monday through Friday (except U.S. and German holidays). Please bring a form of identification (preferably a U.S. passport) and inform the guard that you would like to drop off voting materials. Ballots will not be accepted at the Embassy building in Mitte near the Brandenburg Gate.\n\n\u00b7 Consulate General Frankfurt: U.S. citizens wishing to drop off ballots can do so at the Consular entrance (Giessener Str. 30, 60435 Frankfurt) of the Consulate General between the hours of 0700-1600, Monday through Friday (except U.S. and German holidays). Please bring a form of identification (preferably a U.S. passport) and inform the guard that you would like to drop off voting materials. The guard will show you to the voting materials drop-box where you can leave your registration or ballot.\n\n\u00b7 Consulate General Munich: U.S. citizens wishing to drop off ballots can do so at the Consular entrance (Von-der-Tann Stra\u03b2e) of the Consulate General (Koeniginstra\u03b2e 5 M\u00fcnchen 80539) between the hours of 1300-1500, Monday through Friday (except U.S. and German holidays). Please bring a form of identification (preferably a U.S. passport) and inform the guard that you would like to drop off voting materials. The guard will show you to the voting materials drop-box where you can leave your registration or ballot.\n\nPlease note that all visitors to the Embassy or Consulates General are subject to security screening and you will not be permitted to bring electronic devices, including cell phones, inside the facility. Also note that it can take up to four weeks for mail to reach its destination if sent by an embassy or consulate via diplomatic pouch. All U.S. citizens are advised to submit their forms and ballots accordingly.\n\nAny U.S. citizen voter in Germany, regardless of location, may elect to submit their ballot by mail within Germany to the U.S. Embassy in Berlin. U.S. citizens wishing to drop off ballots in-person at one of the U.S. Consulates General in D\u00fcsseldorf, Hamburg, or Leipzig can email GermanyACS@state.gov to coordinate a time to do so.\n\nSubmission by Mail:\n\nU.S. citizens throughout Germany may mail their documents to the U.S. Embassy in Berlin using any local courier.

        "text": "AI-Powered Russian Influence Network Targets U.S. Elections\nAmerican flag waving with the Capitol Hill in the background getty\n\nA Russia-linked influence network is using inauthentic websites and generative AI to try and influence the outcome of the U.S. presidential election, according to research from cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.\n\nThe researchers said that CopyCop, first discovered a few weeks ago, registered 120 new websites between May 10 and May 12. And, using AI-generated content and fake journalist personas, it's shifted away from its previous focus on topics such as Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine and domestic politics in France and the U.K., and now has a new focus on the U.S. presidential elections.\n\nThe group scrapes and alters articles from mainstream and conservative-leaning U.S. and U.K. media as well as from Russian state-affiliated outlets and spreads them to U.S. election-themed websites, all within 24 hours of the original articles being posted. Its sources for this plagiarized content include Breitbart, the New York Post and the Washington Examiner as well as outlets previously accused of spreading false information, such as The Epoch Times and Zero Hedge, and state-owned or state-aligned Russian media, such as Gazeta, TASS and RT.\n\nAs of late May, former U.S. president Donald Trump and President Joe Biden have become by far the most frequently mentioned people, with the U.S. election candidates targeted far more often than the group's previous targets.\n\nThe good news is that, as of early June, CopyCop's new AI-generated content has seen little to no amplification on social media. But, the researchers said, this could change.\n\n\"Influence networks using generative AI, like CopyCop, are likely to become more prominent ahead of the 2024 US elections, although they may not gain significant attention initially,\" they wrote.\n\n\"Amplification of CopyCop content by existing influence networks is helping bring its content to existing audiences. Once these websites have established persistence, CopyCop will likely publish more targeted content hidden among the high volume of AI-generated content, making them harder to identify and parse out,\" they added.\n\nThe content consists of denigrating President Biden and Democratic policymakers, for example, by highlighting mistakes Biden made during speeches and referring to his age. It also criticizes the Biden Administration\u2019s failure to curb inflation, along with recent negative polls.\n\nThe report follows recent research from news monitoring service NewsGuard, which revealed how leading AI chatbots including OpenAI's ChatGPT, Microsoft's Copilot and Google's Gemini can be used to regurgitate Russian misinformation\u2014and much of the content described by Recorded Future is the same.\n\nIndeed, CopyCop\u2019s operators are suspected to include John Mark Dougan, a Russia-based U.S. citizen on whose disinformation narratives the NewsGuard team carried out its tests.\n\nIn order to try and disguise its connection with the Russian government, said Recorded Future, CopyCop recently switched its infrastructure to U.S.-based hosts. Meanwhile, the AI-generated content also makes it harder to attribute influence operations to foreign adversaries by speeding up the \"laundering\" process and obscuring the origin of the content.\n\n\"As coordinated inauthentic behavior networks continue to evolve tactics and targets, persistently identifying and publicly exposing these networks ahead of the 2024 US elections should remain a priority for public and industry organizations,\" the researchers said.\n\nNews organizations should track content from known influence threat actors who are likely plagiarizing and weaponizing proprietary content and intellectual property, which increases reputational risks.\"",

        "text": "Overturning Roe is Just the Beginning\nTwo years after Trump\u2019s Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the ACLU examines how a second Trump administration would further imperil abortion access and reproductive rights nationwide \u2013 and our roadmap to fight back.\n\nThis piece was published before Joe Biden withdrew from the 2024 presidential election and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to represent the Democratic Party. No significant facts have been changed or added. Today marks two years since Roe v. Wade was overturned, wiping out federal protections for abortion rights. This decision was a direct result of Donald Trump\u2019s actions. In 2016, during his presidential campaign, he vowed to appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe. Over the course of his presidency, he did just that \u2013 appointing the three Supreme Court justices who later voted to reverse decades of protections for abortion rights. Trump\u2019s devastating legacy is clear. Today, anti-abortion politicians in 17 states have banned abortion, leaving millions of people without access to care. If Trump resumes office, this will only be the beginning. Trump\u2019s advisors are already plotting to twist a law from 1873 to effectively ban abortion in all 50 states, even where abortion is protected under state law. Trump won\u2019t stop at abortion rights \u2013 he will seek to limit contraception access, too. At the ACLU we\u2019re gearing up to fight in courts and at every level of government to block the Trump administration\u2019s relentless assault on reproductive rights. Learn more in our breakdown:\n\nTrump on Abortion\n\nThe Facts: In an attempt to deceive voters \u2013 who overwhelmingly oppose restricting abortion access \u2013 Trump has waffled on whether he\u2019d encourage Congress to pass a new law to ban abortion nationwide. He doesn\u2019t need Congress, however, to attempt to wreak havoc on our access to abortion. According to Trump\u2019s anti-abortion strategists, a new Trump administration can bypass Congress and use a 150-year-old law called the Comstock Act to effectively ban abortion nationwide. The Comstock Act is an 1873 anti-obscenity statute that regulates the use of the mail and common carriers concerning sending and receiving anything that is \u201cindecent, filthy, or vile\u201d or \u201cintended for producing abortion.\u201d Even though this law has long been understood not to apply to the lawful abortion, Trump\u2019s advisors plan to misuse this antiquated law to effectively ban abortion nationwide. In addition to weaponizing the Comstock Act to imperil abortion access, a second Trump administration would respond to calls from his allies to withdraw the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) approval of mifepristone, a safe and effective medication used in most abortions and miscarriage care in the U.S. Trump has also admitted that he has a plan to restrict access to contraception. Why It Matters: Donald Trump made it possible for anti-abortion extremists to deny people the right to make decisions about their bodies and their lives. Since the justices he appointed overturned Roe, 17 states have banned abortion. Today, millions of people of reproductive age live hundreds of miles from the closest abortion provider, forcing more than 171,000 persons to travel outside of their home state to secure access to abortion care in 2023 alone. Many others are not able to get the care they need at all. In spite of the fact that Trump\u2019s anti-abortion policies run counter to the will of the public, we know that, should Trump secure a second term, his administration will not hesitate to further decimate reproductive rights and try to ban abortion nationwide.\n\nTrump on Abortion The ACLU examines how a second Trump administration would further imperil reproductive rights nationwide \u2013 and our roadmap to fight back.\n\nSource: American Civil Liberties Union",

        "text": "'Liar or fool': Elon Musk's political post on X amid US presidential election campaigns\nNEW DELHI: Elon Musk , the CEO of Tesla , recently expressed his views on political parties through a social media platform formerly known as Twitter. In his statement, Musk emphasized that no political party is infallible, stating, \"Anyone who claims that their political party does no wrong, and the other party does no right, is either a liar, a fool, or both.\"This comment comes amidst the intensifying campaigning for the 2024 United States Presidential Elections , with President Joe Biden and his Republican challenger, Donald Trump, preparing for the race.Musk's political opinions are not new. In January, he joined former President Donald Trump and Republican critics in denouncing a controversial Senate border deal that President Biden described as the \"toughest\" set of reforms. Musk asserted on X that no new laws were necessary to address the US border crisis, calling Biden's \"open border\" policy \"undeniable.\"He later added that anyone who blindly believes in the promises made by a political party is an idiot, stating, \"As a general rule, if you believe everything your political party says, you are an idiot.\" In 2022, Musk openly declared his support for the Republican Party, announcing his switch from Democrat to Republican.During a recent shareholder meeting, Musk shared insights into his conversations with Donald Trump, revealing that the former president is a fan of Tesla's Cybertruck.Musk described Trump as \"very nice\" during their exchanges, where he promoted the advantages of electric vehicles and emphasized America's leadership in the battery-powered car industry. Musk suggested that Trump's appreciation for the Cybertruck might be influenced by the vehicle's popularity among his friends.Last month, Musk's criticism of President Biden intensified on X, with the Tesla CEO stating that the president \"obviously barely knows what's going on\" and characterizing him as \"just a tragic front for a far left political machine.\" Musk's posts about Biden have increased significantly this year, with nearly 40 posts compared to around 30 in the previous year.In contrast, Musk has posted more than 20 times on X about Donald Trump, defending the former president and arguing that he is a victim of media and prosecutorial bias in the criminal cases he faces. As the owner of an influential social media platform, Musk's willingness to openly express his political views and potentially sway public opinion sets him apart from other social media leaders.",

He's a pediatrician and a professor of vaccinology at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nDr. Offit, thank you so much for joining the \"NewsHour.\"\n\nI want to start. First, Donald Trump's campaign claimed that this was about COVID mandates. Later on, they became a bit vague. They refused to specify to the press, and they pointed to the former president's comments. Trump has made this proposal a regular part of his campaign stump speech, saying any school with a vaccine mandate will not get federal funding.\n\nWhat is the public health impact of rhetoric that attacks childhood vaccinations in this way?\n\nDr. Paul Offit, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia: Well, we eliminated measles in this country by the year 2000. The reason was school vaccine mandates and the enforcement of school vaccine mandates.\n\nPrior to that, certainly prior to a vaccine, measles would cause 48,000 hospitalizations and 500 deaths a year. But we eliminated measles because of that. Now what's happened, and I think in large part because of the COVID vaccine mandates, there's been enormous pushback against school vaccine mandates, so much so that we have had more than 300 cases of measles in the last few years.\n\nAnd I think, if we continue to do this, continue to try and push back on school vaccine mandates, as former President Trump is doing, you're going to get to the point where we will see 1,000 or 2000 cases of measles a year, at which point children will start once again to die from measles.",

        "text": "Steve Bannon on how his War Room is shaping Republican narratives: \u2018We\u2019re relentless. I will never back off\u2019\nView image in fullscreen Illustration: Eddie Guy/The Guardian\n\nIt is not your typical man cave. Christian iconography. A bust of Julius Caesar. A painting of John Paul Jones, the revolutionary war naval officer. A book, The Russian Revolution by Richard Pipes, sitting on a crowded desk. A sign resting on the mantelpiece declares: \u201cThere are no conspiracies, but there are no coincidences.\u201d\n\nWelcome to the War Room, where the classical, contemporary and conspiratorial nourish Steve Bannon\u2019s grand vision of himself as a historical figure. Each day he holds court in this basement on Capitol Hill to plot not only Donald Trump\u2019s return to power but the next American revolution. Screens, microphones and other podcasting paraphernalia sit above piles of books and newspapers, namely the Financial Times and New York Times.\n\n\u201cI was a paper boy so I love papers,\u201d explains Bannon, picking up his phone as he continues: \u201cYou can\u2019t read it on here. It\u2019s not the same. First off, one of the most important things is the editorial choices. Very important how they place it, how they do it.\u201d\n\nThe 70-year-old \u2013 once featured on the front of Time magazine with the headlines \u201cThe Great Manipulator\u201d and \u201cIs Steve Bannon the Second Most Powerful Man in the World?\u201d \u2013 is constantly thinking about the media and shaping narratives. He believes that he wields more influence through his War Room show, which launched in October 2019, than he did working on Trump\u2019s first election campaign or during a brief, ill-fated spell as White House chief strategist.\n\nHis impact on the 2024 election is about to be severely disrupted: Bannon must report to prison by 1 July to serve a four-month sentence for defying a subpoena from the congressional committee that investigated the 6 January 2021 insurrection at the US Capitol. That means he should be back on air just before the 5 November presidential election.\n\nBut jail, he insists, doesn\u2019t worry him. \u201cIf I go to prison, I go to prison,\u201d he says in an interview given before a federal judge confirmed that Bannon must turn himself in. \u201cI was on a navy ship for four years at sea.\u201d\n\nThe former navy lieutenant, Goldman Sachs banker and Hollywood film producer, who grew up in a working-class Irish Catholic family in Virginia, has been variously compared to Thomas Cromwell, Rasputin and Joseph Goebbels. In person, wielding a mug of coffee, he is affable, bombastic and garrulous.\n\nA question about how Bannon defines \u201cMake America great again\u201d (Maga) leads to a stream of consciousness that touches on \u201csalt of the earth\u201d guys he knew in the navy; Robert Clive, the British soldier and administrator; the American civil war (\u201cLincoln was an ultranationalist\u201d); and today\u2019s struggle between a credential class and the citizens denied a seat at the table.\n\n\u201cWhat the ruling class in our nation should fear is President Trump\u2019s audience, from Wildwood, New Jersey, to South Bronx to Miami to Charlotte,\u201d he says. \u201cThe commonality is that American citizens who work their ass off \u2013 the whole country depends on them \u2013 of every race and ethnicity don\u2019t think they\u2019re at the table and they don\u2019t think anybody except Trump wants them at the table. Trump not only puts you in the room, he puts you at the head of the table and that\u2019s why they [the elites] hate him and that\u2019s why they have to destroy him.\u201d\n\nDespite his instinctive antipathy towards online media, Bannon starts each morning with the Guardian, Financial Times and Times of London, then turns to the American press. His logic: \u201cIf you really want to follow the right and Trump and Maga, you can\u2019t go to Fox or Newsmax because they don\u2019t cover it. There\u2019s no other site out there that covers it. You\u2019ve got to go to MSNBC or the Guardian.\u201d\n\nAs he speaks, MSNBC is playing on a giant TV above the fireplace of an adjacent room. War Room\u2019s conservative audience laps up clips of liberal hosts such as Rachel Maddow, just as the comedian Jon Stewart has long titillated Daily Show viewers with contraband from the Fox News universe. Bannon reasons: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to understand where your enemies are and how they\u2019re framing the narrative to understand the contemporary world and to be effective.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Trump supporters storm the US Capitol following a rally on 6 January 2021 in Washington DC. Photograph: Samuel Corum/Getty Images\n\nWar Room has been described by the Washington Post as \u201ca far\u2010right Meet the Press\u201d, a reference to the NBC network\u2019s long-running, agenda-setting political talkshow. It broadcasts live for 22 hours a week on various platforms including radio, Rumble and Real America\u2019s Voice, a new pro-Trump network.\n\nBannon claims that it is invariably number two in the political podcast charts behind Pod Save America, hosted by a group of former aides to Barack Obama, and benefits from a lack of competition on the right. But how many people are consuming it is unknown.\n\nWith evident pride, Bannon says the show does not talk down to its listeners and viewers but serves up a unique combination of politics, geopolitics, capital markets and macroeconomics. \u201cWhat we try to do here is raise the bar higher than they can reach it, so the audience has to stretch,\u201d he adds.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t try to have a mass audience; I never have. We\u2019re very focused on activists or people who will become activists because you have to build a vanguard. The old Republican party wanted a vanguard like [William F] Buckley with smart Ivy League guys writing for the National Review and going to cocktail parties; that might have worked then but we\u2019re in a different era today.\u201d\n\nHeadquartered just 500 yards from the supreme court, War Room is less Republican, Bannon says, than a platform for the grassroots of the populist nationalist movement. Madeline Peltz, who monitors emerging rightwing media trends at the watchdog Media Matters for America, says by phone: \u201cOne of the things that makes Steve Bannon different from his fellow travellers is he doesn\u2019t turn his nose up at any segment of the American population.\n\n\u201cHe folds in absolutely anyone who\u2019s willing to hear him out. Whereas on the left you see a lot more infighting, Steve Bannon is looking always to expand the coalition, to expand his audience. He has unique eye for that and knack for that.\u201d\n\nBut the show\u2019s sway over Republican politics cannot be overestimated. It has hosted guests including Elise Stefanik, the number three Republican in the House of Representatives, and other future leaders.\n\nView image in fullscreen Elise Stefanik, the House Republican conference chairperson speaks during a post-meeting press conference with other House Republicans leaders in Washington DC this month. Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images\n\nClose to Bannon\u2019s desk sits a copy of Project 2025, the near 900-page blueprint for a second Trump presidency \u2013 including a Bannon-esque dismantling of the administrative state \u2013 produced by the Heritage Foundation, a thinktank just a few minutes\u2019 walk away. \u201cI keep my bible right there,\u201d Bannon says admiringly. \u201cIt shows you that he has a vast group of people that want to work with him. The left is in total and complete meltdown.\u201d\n\nFrom attacking Trump\u2019s impeachment to draconian border security (\u201cI\u2019m 100% for mass deportations day one\u201d), from baseless vaccine conspiracy theories to slashing military funding to Ukraine, War Room is an incubator of policies that worm their way into Republican orthodoxy months or years later.\n\n\u201cWe get on an idea and we drive it,\u201d Bannon says. \u201cWe think through narratives we\u2019re working on and we think how we\u2019re going to place people and how they\u2019re going to come on and what we\u2019re going to talk about. What\u2019s the narrative engine of this? We do a ton of work to make sure that we\u2019re not wrong on things.\u201d\n\nFactcheckers disagree. Last year a study by the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington found that almost 20% of War Room episodes contained a false, misleading or unsubstantiated statement, making it a bigger spreader of disinformation than any other political podcast.\n\nRead more on the election operators shaping Trump\u2019s White House bid:\n\nCharlie Kirk : Republicans are turning on the former youth guru\n\nKevin Roberts : the force behind Project 2025\n\nCleta Mitchell : the ex-Democratic firebrand turned election denier\n\nHans von Spakovsky: the man who cries voter fraud\n\nPeltz adds: \u201cWar Room is on four hours a day, five days a week, and two hours on Saturday. It is an endless stream of nonsense and the overwhelming volume of the content allows him to just throw spaghetti at the wall and one thing sticks, the other thing doesn\u2019t stick. He\u2019s very heavy on apocalyptic innuendo and very light on details.\u201d\n\nOne of Bannon\u2019s litmus tests for Republicans is the 2020 presidential election. Despite Trump losing more than 60 lawsuits challenging the result, and despite William Barr, the then attorney general, stating that the justice department uncovered no evidence of widespread voter fraud, the War Room host regards Biden as a \u201ctotally illegitimate\u201d president.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the railhead of the big steal every day, with every aspect of it, and we take pride in it,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m adamant. There shouldn\u2019t be anybody in the Trump campaign or the RNC [Republican National Committee] in a paid position that does not believe to the marrow of their bones that the 2020 election was stolen. If you don\u2019t believe that, to me, you miss the point of where we are and why we\u2019re here.\u201d\n\nBannon, former head of Breitbart News, describes the unwillingness of Fox News and other media to touch the subject of the 2020 election as \u201ca psyop\u201d. He claims credit for opinion polls that show a majority of Republicans think Biden did not win a free and fair election. \u201cIt\u2019s War Room, it\u2019s a couple of other podcasts and look how we\u2019ve changed the numbers. Why? Because we\u2019re relentless. I will never back off that.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen A Project 2025 booth at the Conservative Political Action Conference held in Maryland. Photograph: Michael Brochstein/Sipa USA via Alamy\n\nWill he commit to accepting the result of the 2024 election, irrespective of the winner? \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to go through it line by line and make sure. It\u2019s got to be certifiable, chain of custody, legitimate votes from American citizens. If we do that and those votes are there I have no problem if they win, but we\u2019re not going to answer now \u2018Yes, we\u2019re going to do it\u2019, because we don\u2019t know, we\u2019re not there yet and it\u2019s going to be hard fought. Nobody\u2019s asked Democrats that if Trump wins.\u201d\n\nTrump inspired the mob to storm the Capitol, admires the likes of Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un and has joked about being a dictator on \u201cday one\u201d. But Bannon dismisses the notion that he poses a fundamental threat to democracy. \u201cYou look at the first three years of peace and prosperity, he was anything but a dictator. He was more inclusive in talking to people.\u201d\n\nNoting Trump\u2019s recent campaign stops with construction workers and firefighters and a rally that drew thousands in Wildwood, New Jersey, he continues: \u201cThose are probably low-information voters who love the guy and see the guy\u2019s not a dictator, or are nostalgic for their lived experience. You see that he\u2019s anything but an authoritarian figure.\n\n\u201cAlso, the anti-democracy stuff\u2019s not working. They can\u2019t sell it. They\u2019re going to try something else but they can\u2019t sell that so just go look at reality.\u201d\n\nMuch ink has already been spilled about how, with guardrails off and lackeys at his side, Trump\u2019s second term would be more radical and inimical to democracy than the first. Bannon isn\u2019t buying it. In his view, Trump is actually holding even more extreme forces at bay.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is actually a moderate in the Maga movement,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s a very kind-hearted, big-hearted guy. He\u2019s a hotel[ier], he\u2019s greeting people, he would be the first person to reach out, like he was the first person in \u201916 to reach out.\n\n\u201cTo the right of President Trump? Not so kind-hearted. We\u2019re very focused and we\u2019re to the right of him because it\u2019s just not his nature to be as far rightwing as we are. We love him, he\u2019s the head of our movement but what comes after Trump is a much bigger shockwave to the liberal establishment and to the progressive establishment that basically controls the country.\u201d\n\nBy way of example, Bannon lists a variety of conservative authors and pundits who, though not normally considered \u201cMaga\u201d, united in fierce condemnation of Trump\u2019s criminal conviction in New York and called for vengeance. He foresees the right burying its differences and joining forces to defeat the status quo.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s after Trump. You\u2019re seeing it now. It\u2019s getting bigger every day. We\u2019re ascendant with everything that\u2019s going on. It\u2019s like the Catholic church was in eastern Europe or it\u2019s like in China. When groups are suppressed and everything is done to debank them and suppress them, they come together in a more unified method and put aside their own differences to fight a common enemy.\n\n\u201cWe have a common enemy and that is the deep state and the progressive left, Wall Street and the tech oligarchs that run this country and turn it into not a constitutional republic. We\u2019ve put aside a lot of our differences to organise for that fight.\n\n\u201cNow we have people that are Never Trumpers that are coming to our cause and seeing what we\u2019ve been saying for a long time. Yeah, you see what? We weren\u2019t crazy. You see what\u2019s actually happening? That\u2019s what is building every day and getting more powerful.\u201d\n\nOne of those would-be avengers, the rightwing media personality Megyn Kelly, recently called for Bannon to take command of Trump\u2019s campaign. His imminent incarceration puts paid to that idea, and he faces a separate trial on charges that he duped donors who gave money to build a wall along the US-Mexico border, but he says he would not take the job anyway.\n\nView image in fullscreen Megyn Kelly on the set of her show, Megyn Kelly Today, at NBC Studios in New York. Photograph: Charles Sykes/Invision/AP\n\n\u201cThe role here is much more important. This [the campaign] has nothing to do with strategy any more. It\u2019s so obvious what has to happen and it\u2019s nuts and bolts. This is all execution \u2013 \u201916 wasn\u2019t like that.\u201d\n\nBannon helped write Trump\u2019s inaugural address about American carnage, but their relationship is nebulous. His team sends clips of War Room to the former president every day. On occasion Trump responds with handwritten notes saying things like \u201cattaboy\u201d or \u201cthis is outrageous\u201d. But does Bannon still speak with Trump often?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about all the conversations, but I stay in contact with the president enough that there is no separation between the War Room and President Trump. If you watch the War Room, you\u2019ll see a lot of stuff pop up in the speeches and what he\u2019s put up on Truth Social.\n\n\u201cHe has a phrase, \u2018my people\u2019, and his people have never really had a media platform that\u2019s also interactive, where they can participate and push out stuff. Fox is very passive and very traditional Republican. They always take the neocon line; there\u2019s never a war they didn\u2019t like. They only even covered the border because of ratings.\u201d\n\nBannon has now reached an age when most people are considering retiring; instead he is facing prison and nurturing monumental ambitions that transcend a mere presidential election. Why? \u201cLook, I gave eight years of my life as a young man to service of the country,\u201d he explains. \u201cI come from a working-class family that had two sons go be naval officers and grandchildren went to West Point and serve in the military.\n\n\u201cThis is service to the country. I came from a relatively humble background, the greatest people on earth, and those people deserve a shot. I believe in this country, I believe in those people and I believe in the little guy throughout the world. It\u2019s a calling and I love it. I couldn\u2019t think of any other way to spend my time. I\u2019ll do this till I go out of here boots first.\u201d",

        "text": "The stock market is having its best election year ever\nLondon CNN \u2014\n\nTraders could be forgiven for breaking out their champagne glasses, even though 2024 isn\u2019t halfway done yet.\n\nUS stocks have leaped from all-time high to all-time high this year: the S&P 500 has surpassed its own record a staggering 31 times since January. That equates to a new all-time high about every four trading days.\n\nInvestors have shrugged off elevated interest and inflation rates, a chaotic political and global environment and general economic uncertainty to give markets the best start to an election year on record.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening: Presidential election years are typically good for stocks.\n\nThe S&P 500 alone has generated an average return of 7% during presidential election years since 1952, according to LPL Financial. If you limit that to election years in which the incumbent president is running for reelection, the average jumps to 12.2%.\n\nThis year, the index has already far surpassed those average gains. The S&P 500 is 14.6% higher year-to-date \u2014 the best start to an election year on record, according to Goldman Sachs \u2014 and up nearly 31% from its October 2023 low at 4,117 points.\n\nSo why is this election cycle different from all the others that have gone before?\n\nGains are typically higher when incumbent presidents run for reelection, most likely because investors crave stability. And this election is the first since 1892 that the nominees of both major parties have occupied the White House, notes Ed Clissold, chief US strategist at Ned Davis Research.\n\nIf one incumbent running for office reduces uncertainty, then two incumbents really reduces uncertainty. That could pull the typical year-end election relief rally forward, said Clissold.\n\nA reason to celebrate: Not only are stocks up, they\u2019re rarely going down.\n\nIt\u2019s been 333 days since the S&P 500 recorded a decline of 2% or greater, which is the longest stretch since February 2018, wrote Goldman Sachs\u2019 Scott Rubner in a recent note to clients. His outlook for the latter half of the year remains positive \u2014 a good first half means a \u201cvery good\u201d second half, he wrote.\n\n\u201cThe impressive market rally continues, notable not only for its strength but also for its stability,\u201d wrote Nationwide\u2019s chief of investment research, Mark Hackett, in a note Friday. \u201c[T]here is no reason that the steady march higher can\u2019t persist, particularly as we approach the tailwind from election seasonality.\u201d\n\nLast week\u2019s rally was broad, assuaging some concerns from investors that recent gains have been concentrated in a few big names like tech darling Nvidia, which is up more than 155% so far this year.\n\nThe equal-weighted version of the S&P 500 rose 1.12% and the small cap Russell 2000 gained 0.79% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq was flat on the week.\n\nThe sustained gains are causing some analysts to raise their year-end targets for the S&P 500.\n\nScott Chronert, research head of US equity strategy at Citigroup, raised his year-end target to 5,600 from 5,100 last week.\n\nAnalysts at Goldman Sachs, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and UBS have also revised their expectations for the broad-based index higher.\n\nYes, but: Market volatility in an election year tends to pick up in October and there are many months left in this cycle with potential surprises to come.\n\nThursday brings CNN\u2019s televised debate between President Joe Biden and former president Donald Trump. \u201cThere is plenty of scope for big headlines and for the candidates to gather some momentum or see it go into reverse,\u201d wrote Deutsche Bank\u2019s Jim Reid.\n\nThere\u2019s also the prospect that investors get complacent and begin to take the current bull market for granted.\n\n\u201cThe longer optimism remains high, the bigger the risk that it turns into complacency and leaves the market vulnerable to the next piece of negative news,\u201d said Clissold with Ned Davis Research.\n\n\u201cAn autumn pullback fits well time wise with potential downside earnings revisions, make-or-break decision time for the Fed, and election uncertainty. The risk is that one or more of those catalysts prove to be longer lasting, turning a pullback into something more,\u201d he said.\n\nA global view: The United States isn\u2019t the only country with an upcoming election. France and the UK both face elections in the coming weeks. While opinion polls suggest the opposition centre-left Labour Party is heading for a comfortable victory in the UK on July 4, the situation in France is much more uncertain, and markets have been rattled.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron called a snap parliamentary election after his centrist Renaissance party lost heavily to the far-right opposition in European elections.\n\nThe first round of the French election will be held on June 30, with a second round on July 7.\n\n\u201cPolitical uncertainty is a near-term headwind to both sentiment (reflected through financial markets) and, now, activity,\u201d wrote Katie Nixon, chief investment officer for Northern Trust Wealth Management, of the upcoming elections. Until July, \u201cwe can anticipate volatility in European equity and debt markets.\u201d\n\nAlaska Airlines reaches tentative labor deal with flight attendants\n\nAlaska Airlines and its 7,000-member flight attendants union reached a tentative labor deal late Friday, concluding talks that lasted more than a year and a half, reports my colleague Chris Isidore.\n\nTerms of the deal have not been released, though the union called it a \u201crecord contract.\u201d\n\nThe deal likely contains a significant pay raise, which has been a common demand across the airline industry and sought by unions whose members in some cases have not seen a pay increase in years.\n\nIn April, the union announced to members it was seeking pay raises of between 43% to 56%, depending upon seniority, through 2026. Those pay raises would include back pay covering a period dating back a year and a half that they\u2019ve worked under the terms of the previous contract.\n\nIn February, flight attendants from Alaska \u2014 along with American, United and Southwest \u2014held unprecedented coordinated pickets demanding new contracts.\n\nSince then, flight attendants at Southwest reached a deal that included an immediate 22.3% raise as of May 1 and $364 million in retroactive wages.\n\nMeanwhile, flight attendants at American and United are still seeking new deals. American flight attendants have asked to be released from restrictions so they can go on strike, but even if that is granted there would be months of cooling off periods before they could walk out, under the Railway Labor Act.\n\nApple\u2019s new China problem: ChatGPT is banned there\n\nApple is banking on its upcoming AI features to boost iPhone sales especially in China, where demand has been lagging.\n\nBut there\u2019s a problem, reports my CNN colleague Samantha Murphy Kelly, ChatGPT \u2014 soon to be integrated into Siri \u2014 is banned in China.\n\nIn a presentation earlier this month, Apple (AAPL) showed off its proprietary technology called Apple Intelligence to power compelling new AI features and announced a partnership with OpenAI to also use its viral ChatGPT tool in a limited capacity. (When Siri is activated and needs more assistance answering an inquiry, ChatGPT can step in.)\n\nThe move signaled how Apple is trying to expedite the latest buzzy technology at a time when tech rivals, such as Microsoft, Google, Meta and Samsung, have already found their AI footing. A deal with OpenAI could help Apple close the gap.\n\nBut China is one of the first countries in the world to regulate the generative AI technology that powers these popular services. In August, the Cyberspace Administration of China, the country\u2019s top internet watchdog, rolled out new guidelines for the industry, requiring companies to seek approval before deployment. The organization has approved more than 100 AI models as of March, all from Chinese companies.\n\nAccording to a report from the Wall Street Journal Thursday, Apple is looking for a Chinese AI company to partner with ahead of the iPhone\u2019s expected September launch, but it hasn\u2019t reached a deal yet.\n\nApple did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe need to find a partner \u2014 and quickly \u2014 comes at a time when Apple\u2019s smartphone sales tumbled a stunning 10% in the first quarter of this year, according to market research firm IDC, due largely to iPhone sales sharply dropping in China. The company has lost momentum in China as nationalism, a rough economy and increased competition have also hurt sales. China is the company\u2019s second-largest market.",

        "text": "Trump and Biden prepare for first US presidential debate\nJoe Biden and Donald Trump square off for a historic US presidential debate this week, with the stage set for what could be a pivotal moment in the 2024 race as millions of potential voters tune in. Joe Biden to face off Donald Trump in first US presidential debate on June 27, 2024(AP)\n\nAlso Read: When will Joe Biden and Donald Trump debate? Date, time and rules explained\n\nThe showdown fires the starting gun on what promises to be a bruising summer on the campaign trail, in a deeply polarized and tense United States still convulsed over the chaos and violence that accompanied the 2020 election.\n\nWith only two debates this cycle, Thursday's high-stakes clash takes on heightened significance, and both candidates have stepped up their personal attacks, with national polls showing the pair neck and neck.\n\n\"The debate is important because it's an opportunity for two well-known candidates to 'reintroduce' themselves to a public that knows them well but hasn't been paying attention,\" said Donald Nieman, a political analyst and history professor at Binghamton University in New York state.\n\n\"The big question is how much of the public -- beyond political aficionados -- will pay attention to such an early debate.\"\n\nFor Trump, the 90-minute clash is a chance to drive home worries about 81-year-old Biden's mental alertness -- although the Republican, 78, has faced age concerns of his own.\n\nFor Biden, the first ever debate between a sitting and former president will be an opportunity to underline the legal challenges engulfing Trump and to paint him as unfit for office.\n\nThe president will also be desperate to avoid any major gaffes -- which, on this stage, could lose him the November election.\n\nBiden vs Trump: Insult-laden tirades'\n\nThe debate comes in the wake of a criminal trial that has consumed Trump's attention for months -- with his sentencing on 34 convictions for falsifying business records scheduled for July 11.\n\nBoth candidates shunned the bipartisan commission that has run debates since 1988, deciding instead to go with CNN for a first showdown unusually early in the year, and another on ABC on September 10.\n\nAbortion, the state of US democracy and foreign conflicts are all issues of concern to voters, although inflation and border security are likely to loom largest.\n\nThe last debates between the two men in 2020 were fraught, with Biden at one point snapping \"will you shut up, man?\" as Trump repeatedly interrupted him.\n\nThis time, moderators have more tools than usual to maintain decorum, with the microphones muted except for the candidate whose turn it is to speak.\n\n\"Trump is notoriously undisciplined and is likely to chafe at not being able to dominate the event by talking over his opponent and drawing out time with his long-winded, insult-laden tirades,\" said political scientist Nicholas Creel, of Georgia College and State University.\n\n\"Biden is also counting on this debate reminding Americans of the chaos that was the Trump presidency, so Trump being unable to abide by the rules and performing poorly as a result is a very striking possibility.\"\n\nDebate to be social media soundbites and not policy arguments\n\nBut debates are about soundbites on social media as much as policy arguments, and both candidates will look for explosive viral moments.\n\n\"I'll be looking for whether former president Trump tries to become more 'presidential' in any respect, though the campaign trail would suggest the answer to that is no,\" said Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University.\n\nThe Biden campaign released an ad last week hitting Trump over his criminal convictions as the president headed to his mountainside retreat at Camp David to fine-tune attack lines and rebuttals.\n\nTrump -- who struggles in granular discussions of policy -- huddled with aides and vice presidential hopefuls at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, where the emphasis was more on tone and broad substance than detail.\n\nTrump would benefit by sticking to a script, highlighting Biden's weaknesses on inflation and immigration and dialing down the bombast, said Nieman, the Binghamton analyst.\n\n\"It would disappoint his base, but it would go far to make inroads with suburban, college-educated women,\" he told AFP.",

Proponents say the forum\u2019s small and relatively homogenous membership promotes collective decision-making, but critics note that it often lacks follow-through and excludes emerging powers.\n\nRussia belonged to the forum from 1998 through 2014, when the bloc was known as the Group of Eight (G8), but the country was suspended following its annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimea region. The G7\u2019s future has recently been challenged by continued tensions with Russia and, increasingly, China, as well as by internal disagreements over trade and climate policies. But responding to Moscow and Beijing has also brought the bloc together. In a sign of renewed cooperation, the G7 has imposed coordinated sanctions on Russia over its war in Ukraine and launched a major global infrastructure investment program to counter China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative. The bloc built on these programs at its fiftieth summit, held in southern Italy in 2024. In Apulia, G7 countries agreed on a new framework to fund Ukraine with profits from frozen Russian assets and adopted a newly assertive approach toward China.\n\nWhy was the G7 formed, and how does it work?\n\nThe United States, France, Italy, Japan, the UK, and West Germany formed the Group of Six in 1975 to provide a venue for noncommunist powers to address pressing economic concerns, which included inflation and a recession sparked by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) oil embargo. Canada joined the following year, and Cold War politics invariably entered the group\u2019s agenda.\n\nDaily News Brief A summary of global news developments with CFR analysis delivered to your inbox each morning.

It is represented by the presidents of the European Council, which comprises EU member states\u2019 leaders, and of the European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive body. There is no formal criteria for membership, but all participants are wealthy democracies. The aggregate gross domestic product (GDP) of G7 member states (not including the EU) makes up about 43 percent of the global economy in nominal terms, down from nearly 70 percent three decades ago.\n\nUnlike the United Nations or the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the G7 is not a formal institution with a charter and a secretariat. The presidency, which rotates annually among member states, is responsible for setting the agenda of each year\u2019s summit and arranging logistics for it; in 2024, Italy is acting as president. Ministers and envoys, known as sherpas, hammer out policy initiatives at meetings that precede the gathering of national leaders. Nonmember countries are sometimes invited to participate in G7 meetings.\n\nWhat happened with Russia?\n\nRussia formally joined the group in 1998, making it the G8. U.S. President Bill Clinton thought that admitting Russia to the exclusive club would lend the country international prestige and encourage its first post-Soviet leader, Boris Yeltsin, to hew more closely to the West. Clinton also believed that membership would help mollify Russia as the NATO security alliance opened its doors to former Soviet satellites in Eastern Europe.\n\nClinton\u2019s decision drew some pushback. Finance ministries, in particular, were wary of coordinating economic policy with Russia, which had a relatively small economy and large public debt. But Russia\u2019s backsliding into authoritarianism under President Vladimir Putin has provoked an even stronger reaction. Moscow\u2019s annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine in March 2014 resulted in its indefinite suspension from the group. Frictions between Russia and the G7 also grew over Russia\u2019s support for Syria\u2019s Bashar al-Assad, especially in the wake of chemical attacks linked to Syrian forces, and over Russian interference in U.S. and European elections.\n\nAs Russia\u2019s intervention in Ukraine escalated, the United States and EU ratcheted up economic sanctions in an effort to further isolate Moscow. But the Ukraine conflict has only intensified, with Russia launching a full-scale invasion in early 2022. In response, G7 countries have levied unprecedented sanctions on Russia. These include phasing out imports of Russian oil and gas, a major source of revenue for Moscow, and barring Russian banks from transacting in dollars and euros. Other measures are aimed at curtailing Russia\u2019s military capabilities. G7 members have also provided weapons to Ukraine, collectively pledged more than $100 billion in financial and military aid, and agreed to loan the country an additional $50 billion using windfall profits from frozen Russian assets as collateral.\n\nWhat other challenges has the group faced?\n\nExperts hoped that the reconstituted G7 would have the potential to better facilitate collective action. Without Russia, the group was more \u201clike-minded and capable,\u201d according to former CFR fellow Stewart M. Patrick, currently the Director of the Global Order and Institutions Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. However, President Donald Trump challenged G7 unity on a number of issues, with trade and climate chief among them, contending that U.S. allies took advantage of the United States. Trump also split with the group by calling for Russia\u2019s readmission to the bloc. Other challenges stem from China\u2019s rise as a military and economic power, increasing nuclear proliferation, and the rise of AI.\n\nAt his first G7 summit, in 2017, Trump refused to commit the United States to the Paris Agreement on climate and hinted at plans to withdraw from the deal, leading other members to take the unusual step of singling out the United States in their final communiqu\u00e9. In an unprecedented statement following the summit, then German Chancellor Angela Merkel questioned the cohesiveness of the transatlantic relationship, saying that for the first time since World War II, Europe \u201cmust take our fate into our own hands.\u201d Other leaders and many analysts were alarmed by Trump\u2019s testy relationship with the rest of the group during his presidency. At the same time, European leaders of the G7 have contended with a laundry list of regional challenges, including navigating the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU and maintaining cohesion amid rising nationalism.\n\nAlongside the Russia challenge, the G7 has recently sought to respond to China\u2019s growing ambitions. Beijing\u2019s repression of Uyghurs in the Xinjiang region and its crackdown in Hong Kong have drawn condemnation from G7 members, and its massive Belt and Road Initiative has prompted concerns about its influence over developing countries. The United States, Japan, and the EU have all shared grievances over China\u2019s state-led economic model and alleged unfair trading practices. The country\u2019s growing trade and defense ties with Russia have also caused concerns. At the 2024 summit, G7 members overcame previous divisions within the group over how to respond to China; the final communiqu\u00e9 referenced Beijing dozens of times, almost always as an adversary.\n\nFallout from the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine has created additional obstacles. In 2020, the sharp global economic contraction caused by the pandemic forced G7 governments to respond with massive stimulus measures. In many countries, economic recovery has been accompanied by record levels of inflation and food insecurity. Meanwhile, repeated nuclear threats by Putin, alongside an increasingly bellicose North Korea, have reinvigorated worries about nuclear weapons. Some experts fear that rapidly advancing artificial intelligence could raise the risk of nuclear conflict. At the 2023 summit, the bloc unveiled the \u201cHiroshima AI Process,\u201d which seeks to develop a common framework for AI governance worldwide.\n\nAre there alternatives to the G7?\n\nIn addition to its internal divisions, external dynamics have chipped away at the G7\u2019s global influence, many analysts note. Some argue that the group lacks relevance without China and other emerging global powers. The bloc\u2019s current priorities \u201crisk failure\u201d unless they garner support from other countries, wrote Laura von Daniels, Head of the Americas Research Division at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, after the 2023 summit. Perhaps aware of this, G7 summits often include leaders from outside the bloc. Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, India, Jordan, Kenya, Mauritania, Tunisia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates all participated in 2024.\n\nMany analysts believe that the power and prestige of the Group of Twenty (G20), a forum for finance ministers and central bank governors from nineteen of the world\u2019s largest countries, the EU, and the African Union (AU), has surpassed that of the G7. Emerging powers including Brazil, China, India, Mexico, and South Africa all belong to the G20. Russia remains a member of the G20, despite calls by some G7 countries for its removal. The group\u2019s member states (not including the AU or EU) represent about 78 percent of global GDP and three-fifths of the world\u2019s population.\n\nMany observers argue that the G20 was most effective during the 2007\u201308 global financial crisis. G20 leaders first met in Washington in 2008, after the fall of the investment bank Lehman Brothers. While such consensus has been harder to come by in the years since the crisis, G20 summits have been the occasion for setting ambitious goals. At the 2014 summit, hosted by Australia, leaders adopted a plan to boost their economies by a collective 2.1 percent by 2018, which they did not achieve. In Hangzhou, China, in 2016, President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping used the summit to jointly announce their accession to the Paris Agreement.\n\nThere are also calls for new multilateral arrangements. Some experts previously endorsed an expansion of the G7 to include Australia, India, and South Korea, thereby forming a \u201cD10\u201d group of democracies. While president, Trump floated the idea of a Group of Eleven, comprising the D10 countries and Russia. For its part, Russia and eight other countries form the BRICS group, named for its other original members Brazil, India, China, and South Africa. The bloc admitted Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates in 2024.\n\nIn 2021, then CFR President Richard Haass and Senior Fellow Charles A. Kupchan called for a new concert of powers comprising the United States, China, the EU, India, Japan, and Russia, reminiscent of the nineteenth-century Concert of Europe. The proposed system would have permanent representatives supported by a secretariat to avoid what Haass and Kupchan described as the \u201cfly-in, fly-out\u201d nature of G7 and G20 summits.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for the G7?\n\nSome experts acknowledge that the G7\u2019s influence has diminished, but say that it still has value because all member countries are grappling with similar issues. \u201cThe G7 may no longer be a global agenda setter,\u201d writes Riccardo Alcaro, Research Coordinator and Head of the Global Actors Program at the Institute of International Affairs, an Italian think tank. \u201cYet, insofar as it generates consensus within the U.S.-led Western camp on the conditions for coordinating with geopolitical foes such as China and Russia and reaching out to the Global South, it will retain significant capacity to shape international relations.\u201d\n\nIndeed, achieving consensus on previously divisive issues proved a defining feature of the 2024 summit. In Italy, G7 leaders agreed to a long-debated plan to fund Ukraine using the future expected proceeds from seized Russian assets. European countries, which hold most of these reserves, had for months been reluctant to embrace this Washington-supported plan, making its adoption a \u201cmajor win for U.S. diplomacy,\u201d according to CFR Senior Fellow Matthias Matthijs. The summit also chastised China\u2014often referred to as a partner at past summits\u2014for supporting \u201cRussia\u2019s war machine,\u201d as well as for its assertiveness in the South China Sea and its \u201ceconomic coercion.\u201d On Israel\u2019s ongoing war in the Gaza Strip, the summit\u2019s final leaders' statement endorsed U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s plan for a cease-fire, expressing support for Israel while also urging it to reduce civilian casualties in its fight against Palestinian militant group Hamas.\n\nBut the bloc\u2019s newfound cohesion could be stymied by the domestic disapproval of nearly all of its leaders. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is the only G7 leader with an approval rating above 40 percent, and the United States, Canada, Japan, and the UK are due to hold elections by the end of 2025. \u201cWith potential leadership changes in at least half of the G7 governments in the next fifteen months, the Apulia summit could prove to be the high-water mark of G7 harmony, before a period of chaotic G7 discord and uncertainty,\u201d Matthijs writes.",

                "description": "Laura Feiveson, Deputy Assistant Secretary for MicroeconomicsArik Levinson, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Climate and Energy EconomicsSydney Schreiner Wertz, EconomistFor the past two decades, rents and house prices have been rising faster than incomes across most regions of the United States. For some households, increased housing costs means there is less to spend on everything else, including food, health care, clothing, education, and retirement savings.\u00a0 For others, particularly younger Americans, high costs may be preventing them from living on their own or starting families.\u00a0The affordability challenge is particularly severe for households of color and for low-income communities. Black and Hispanic households tend to spend higher shares of their incomes on housing expenses than white households.[1]\u00a0 And almost 90 percent of families with annual incomes below $20,000 spend more than 30 percent of their incomes on housing expenses\u2014a threshold used by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to indicate unaffordability. Sixty percent of families with incomes between $20,000 and $50,000 face the same challenge. These Americans are on the brink of being priced out of a basic human need.\u00a0For these urgent reasons, the Biden-Harris Administration is taking steps to expand the supply of housing and bring down costs for renters and homebuyers, at the same time as pushing for significant action from Congress and state and local governments. In this blog, we describe some of the root causes of U.S. housing cost growth and the large and slow-moving demographic changes that have led us to where we are today, motivating the need for significant and concerted action.Our main takeaways are:Over the last two decades, housing costs have been rising faster than incomes. More than 90 percent of Americans live in counties where median rents and house prices grew faster than median incomes from 2000 to 2020.Since 2000, housing demand has grown more than housing supply. This is largely due to changing demographics: although the construction of housing has kept pace with overall population growth, it has fallen well short of the estimated number of housing units demanded by an aging population.This is a longstanding problem, and substantial fixes will require federal legislative and state and local action.\u00a0 But the Biden Administration is not waiting for Congress to act and has taken many steps across multiple agencies to increase housing supply. Over the past couple of years, Treasury\u2019s actions include strengthening the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, implementing historic housing investments as part of the American Rescue Plan, supporting community development financial institutions and minority depository institutions, and permanently extending the Federal Financing Bank\u2019s financing support for a HUD risk-sharing initiative. Today, Secretary Yellen will outline additional efforts at Treasury to expand housing supply.I. Housing cost increasesSince 2000, housing costs have been rising faster than median household income (Figure 1). Inflation-adjusted rents have grown steadily, to more than 20 percent above their 2000 level. Inflation-adjusted prices for single-family homes have grown even faster, with a large boom and bust leading up to the financial crisis of the late 2000s and then a particularly sharp increase in the years following the onset of the pandemic. Over the entire period, inflation-adjusted house prices rose about 65 percent. In contrast, inflation-adjusted median household income barely rose over the whole time period.Figure 1. Real Housing Price, Rent and Wage IndexesThis point is broadly true across regions. From 2000 to 2020, median rents rose faster than median household income in 88 percent of U.S. counties, home to 97 percent of the U.S. population (Figure 2). And median house prices grew faster than overall inflation in 88 percent of counties, home to 95 percent of the population (Figure 3). And both median rents and house prices grew faster than overall inflation in 77 percent of counties, home to 93 percent of the population. Rents and home prices also rose in rural and urban areas, and for both single-family homes and apartments in multi-family buildings.[2]\u00a0 In sum, rising housing costs have been widespread and do not simply reflect a mismatch between locations and sectors in which housing is demanded and supplied.\u00a0Figure 2: Growth in median rents less growth in median income, 2000 to 2020Figure 3: Growth in median housing values less growth in median income, 2000 to 2020II. Demographic TrendsRising prices have resulted from growth in housing demand exceeding growth in housing supply. Over the last two decades, a major contributor to housing demand growth has been the changing demographic characteristics of the U.S. population.\u00a0Notably, the population has aged. In 2000, people aged 55 and over made up 20 percent of the U.S. population; by 2020, the 55-and-over share was 30 percent.\u00a0Older people are more likely to be the head of their own household, so as the population ages, demand for homes rises.[3]\u00a0The three panels of Figure 4 visually demonstrate the changing age distribution of housing demand in our population. The blue bars on the left side of each figure show the size of the population in each age range. The gray bars on the right side show the number of households headed by someone in each age range. As the baby boomers have moved from the youngest age ranges in 1980 to the middle age ranges in 2000 to the older age ranges in 2020, the distribution of housing demand has shifted notably. \u00a0 \u00a0Figure 4: Population and Households by AgeOne way to understand the interaction between the aging population and housing demand is by calculating the share of each age group that is a head of household. That is simply the ratio of the gray bars on the right side of Figure 4 to the blue bars on the left. Those ratios are called \u201cheadship rates.\u201d\u00a0Figure 5 shows the headship rates for different age ranges over time. Two facts jump out. First, older age groups have higher headship rates. So, as the population ages, there will be upward pressure on the overall headship rate in the population\u2014and, conversely, downward pressure on the number of people per household, all else equal.[4] Consequently, there will be upward pressure on the number of housing units demanded per person in the population.Second, age-specific headship rates have been declining for the past few decades for every adult age group.[5]\u00a0 One plausible explanation for declining headship rates is the rising housing costs detailed in the previous section.\u00a0Figure 5: Per-Age Headship RatesThe youngest groups have experienced the largest declines in headship rates. In 1980, 50 percent of Americans aged 25 to 34 were heads of their own household (the lowest line on Figure 4). In 2020, that number had fallen to around 40 percent. The headship rate for Americans aged 35 to 44 also fell substantially: from almost 55 percent to less than 50 percent. The decline in headship rates for younger Americans can be seen in the rise of young adults living at home over the same period, as shown in Figure 6. This rise is at least partially attributable to rising rents and house prices.[6]Figure 6. Share of Adults Aged 25 to 34 Living with a ParentIII. Housing demand has outpaced supplyHousing demand growth since 2000 can be assessed by calculating the number of homes that would be required to accommodate the current U.S. population if headship rates for each age group had stayed at their 2000 values. The top line of Figure 7 shows that calculation, estimating that housing demand grew by 26 percent between 2000 and 2020.\u00a0By comparison, Figure 7 shows that the actual housing stock\u2014housing supply\u2014grew by only 19 percent.\u00a0So, the growth in housing demand has outpaced supply\u2014a potentially important cause of rising rents and house prices. Population growth\u2014the bottom line in Figure 7\u2014grew by only 17 percent over this same period.\u00a0In short, housing cost increases have not arisen because population\u00a0outpaced supply. It has not. Instead, housing cost increases have resulted from housing demand outpacing supply, driven in part by demographic shifts.\u00a0Figure 7: Population, estimated housing demand, and housing stock percent growth since 2000IV. Why construction hasn\u2019t kept up pace and the role of policySo why hasn\u2019t housing construction kept pace with the growth of housing demand? One cause of housing undersupply may be local land-use regulations and zoning restrictions.[7]\u00a0 Minimum lot sizes and limits on multifamily apartment buildings can increase prices by limiting supply.[8] Loosening those regulations would remove barriers to new construction, expand housing supply, and lower the rents faced by all households, including those with lower incomes.[9]\u00a0In many places, and for many low-income households, barriers to construction are not the sole culprit. Many households\u2019 incomes are simply too low to spur growth in the supply of reasonably safe and sanitary housing. The future rents they could afford to pay would be insufficient to cover the construction costs of new apartments or houses.[10] And new market-rate construction geared towards higher-income households only has limited success in opening affordable vacancies in older buildings.[11]\u00a0Governments\u2014state, local, and Federal\u2014have good reason to work towards overcoming these barriers to ensure a sufficient supply of affordable housing. Housing is a basic human need. Furthermore, investments in affordable housing support our economy\u2019s medium- and long-run growth. Having an affordable home allows workers to live close to the high-quality jobs where they are most productive, which is particularly important give the ongoing resurgence in American manufacturing.[12] Moreover, there is an abundance of evidence that stable housing provides benefits to children that increase their future long-term success.[13]\u00a0Government policy can support housing supply and affordability in numerous ways: by subsidizing housing construction, by subsidizing renters, by subsidizing home buyers, and by incentivizing state and local governments to remove outdated zoning and land use policies.[14] One of the Federal government\u2019s largest sources of support for affordable housing is administered by Treasury: the Low Income Housing Tax Credit, or LIHTC, which subsidizes the construction and preservation of affordable housing.V. Biden-Harris and Treasury PoliciesThe Biden-Harris Administration and Treasury recognize the urgent need to address housing affordability.\u00a0 In 2022, the Biden-Harris Administration released a\u00a0Housing Supply Action Plan, which included actions across multiple agencies intended to create more affordable housing. In its latest budget, the Biden Administration has called on Congress to invest more than $175 billion to help grow housing supply, including through the expansion of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit. The Administration has also encouraged state and local governments to work to reduce barriers to more housing construction.In the meantime, Treasury is not waiting for Congress to act. Over the past few years, Treasury\u2019s American Rescue Plan programs have enabled state and local governments to deploy billions of dollars to create new and improve existing affordable housing stock.\u00a0Treasury has also supported the construction of affordable housing through the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, the largest source of financing for affordable housing in the country, as well as Treasury\u2019s support for community\u00a0development financial institutions and minority depository\u00a0institutions, which enable these institutions to make housing loans and investments to communities hit hardest by the pandemic. Earlier this year, in a\u00a0blog post, Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo announced a range of Treasury actions to help expand housing supply.\u00a0Today, Secretary Janet Yellen is announcing several additional key housing initiatives in a speech in Minnesota. First, Treasury will be establishing a new program administered by the CDFI Fund that will provide an additional $100 million over the next three years to support the financing of affordable housing. Second, we are working on a major improvement to bolster the Federal Financing Bank\u2019s financing of affordable housing through its support of HUD\u2019s Section 542 Housing Finance Agency Risk-Sharing Initiative. This builds on the recent indefinite extension of the program, which is estimated to help preserve or create 38,000 affordable units over the next decade. Third, we are engaging with the Federal Home Loan Banks, which play a key role in the housing finance system, to explore ways that they can increase their voluntary commitments to housing programs. And fourth, the CDFI Fund is updating the Capital Magnet Fund rule to provide greater flexibility and reduce administrative burden on recipients, which reflects input that Treasury has received from stakeholders.There will not be a quick fix to the long-term rise in housing costs. But the Federal and state and local governments play an important role in ensuring that all Americans have affordable and safe homes. The actions taken now are an important start, and the Administration is prioritizing laying the groundwork for larger legislative action when Congress is ready to act.\u00a0[1] Specifically, in 2022, 57 and 54 percent of renting households with a Black or Hispanic head, respectively, spent more than 30 percent of their income on housing expenses, as opposed to only 45 percent of renting households with a white head.\u00a0More Than 42 Million US Households Were Cost Burdened in 2022 | Joint Center for Housing Studies (harvard.edu)[2] For multi-family rental price index, see Freddie Mac. For single-family home price index, see S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index.[3] See Figure 5.\u00a0[4] Since headship rates have been declining for all age groups, the aggregate effect of an aging population on the number of people per household was muted. Nevertheless, the number of people per household did decrease slightly from 2.7 in 2000 to 2.6 in 2020.\u00a0[5] Note that there is evidence of a decline in headship rates and subsequent rebound in 2020 due to changes in living arrangements related to the Covid-19 pandemic (see\u00a0The Fed - The Remarkable Recent Rebound in Household Formation and the Prospects for Future Housing Demand (federalreserve.gov)). We believe our estimates of 2020 headship rates are likely unaffected by these within-2020 changes because we use data from the 5-year American Community Survey, which were collected from January 2016 to December 2020. While this time period covers the period in which the decline in headship rates and subsequent rebound have been documented, 2020 represents a relatively small share of the entire period during which the data used to generate these estimates were collected.\u00a0[6]\u00a0The Fed - The Long and the Short of Household Formation (federalreserve.gov)[7] E.g., Jason Furman, Barriers to Shared Growth: Land Use Regulation and Economic Rents (2015[8] For example, see\u00a0Ihlanfeldt (2007) and\u00a0Zabel and Dalton (2011).[9]\u00a0JUE Insight: The effect of new market-rate housing construction on the low-income housing market - ScienceDirect[10]\u00a0The cost of affordable housing: Does it pencil out?

        "text": "Rent, House Prices, and Demographics\nLaura Feiveson, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Microeconomics\n\nArik Levinson, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Climate and Energy Economics\n\nSydney Schreiner Wertz, Economist\n\nFor the past two decades, rents and house prices have been rising faster than incomes across most regions of the United States. For some households, increased housing costs means there is less to spend on everything else, including food, health care, clothing, education, and retirement savings. For others, particularly younger Americans, high costs may be preventing them from living on their own or starting families.\n\nThe affordability challenge is particularly severe for households of color and for low-income communities. Black and Hispanic households tend to spend higher shares of their incomes on housing expenses than white households.[1] And almost 90 percent of families with annual incomes below $20,000 spend more than 30 percent of their incomes on housing expenses\u2014a threshold used by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to indicate unaffordability. Sixty percent of families with incomes between $20,000 and $50,000 face the same challenge. These Americans are on the brink of being priced out of a basic human need.\n\nFor these urgent reasons, the Biden-Harris Administration is taking steps to expand the supply of housing and bring down costs for renters and homebuyers, at the same time as pushing for significant action from Congress and state and local governments. In this blog, we describe some of the root causes of U.S. housing cost growth and the large and slow-moving demographic changes that have led us to where we are today, motivating the need for significant and concerted action.\n\nOur main takeaways are:\n\nOver the last two decades, housing costs have been rising faster than incomes. More than 90 percent of Americans live in counties where median rents and house prices grew faster than median incomes from 2000 to 2020.\n\nSince 2000, housing demand has grown more than housing supply. This is largely due to changing demographics: although the construction of housing has kept pace with overall population growth, it has fallen well short of the estimated number of housing units demanded by an aging population.\n\nThis is a longstanding problem, and substantial fixes will require federal legislative and state and local action. But the Biden Administration is not waiting for Congress to act and has taken many steps across multiple agencies to increase housing supply. Over the past couple of years, Treasury\u2019s actions include strengthening the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, implementing historic housing investments as part of the American Rescue Plan, supporting community development financial institutions and minority depository institutions, and permanently extending the Federal Financing Bank\u2019s financing support for a HUD risk-sharing initiative. Today, Secretary Yellen will outline additional efforts at Treasury to expand housing supply.\n\nI. Housing cost increases\n\nSince 2000, housing costs have been rising faster than median household income (Figure 1). Inflation-adjusted rents have grown steadily, to more than 20 percent above their 2000 level. Inflation-adjusted prices for single-family homes have grown even faster, with a large boom and bust leading up to the financial crisis of the late 2000s and then a particularly sharp increase in the years following the onset of the pandemic. Over the entire period, inflation-adjusted house prices rose about 65 percent. In contrast, inflation-adjusted median household income barely rose over the whole time period.\n\nFigure 1. Real Housing Price, Rent and Wage Indexes\n\nThis point is broadly true across regions. From 2000 to 2020, median rents rose faster than median household income in 88 percent of U.S. counties, home to 97 percent of the U.S. population (Figure 2). And median house prices grew faster than overall inflation in 88 percent of counties, home to 95 percent of the population (Figure 3). And both median rents and house prices grew faster than overall inflation in 77 percent of counties, home to 93 percent of the population. Rents and home prices also rose in rural and urban areas, and for both single-family homes and apartments in multi-family buildings.[2] In sum, rising housing costs have been widespread and do not simply reflect a mismatch between locations and sectors in which housing is demanded and supplied.\n\nFigure 2: Growth in median rents less growth in median income, 2000 to 2020\n\nFigure 3: Growth in median housing values less growth in median income, 2000 to 2020\n\nII. Demographic Trends\n\nRising prices have resulted from growth in housing demand exceeding growth in housing supply. Over the last two decades, a major contributor to housing demand growth has been the changing demographic characteristics of the U.S. population. Notably, the population has aged. In 2000, people aged 55 and over made up 20 percent of the U.S. population; by 2020, the 55-and-over share was 30 percent. Older people are more likely to be the head of their own household, so as the population ages, demand for homes rises.[3]\n\nThe three panels of Figure 4 visually demonstrate the changing age distribution of housing demand in our population. The blue bars on the left side of each figure show the size of the population in each age range. The gray bars on the right side show the number of households headed by someone in each age range. As the baby boomers have moved from the youngest age ranges in 1980 to the middle age ranges in 2000 to the older age ranges in 2020, the distribution of housing demand has shifted notably.\n\nFigure 4: Population and Households by Age\n\nOne way to understand the interaction between the aging population and housing demand is by calculating the share of each age group that is a head of household. That is simply the ratio of the gray bars on the right side of Figure 4 to the blue bars on the left. Those ratios are called \u201cheadship rates.\u201d\n\nFigure 5 shows the headship rates for different age ranges over time. Two facts jump out. First, older age groups have higher headship rates. So, as the population ages, there will be upward pressure on the overall headship rate in the population\u2014and, conversely, downward pressure on the number of people per household, all else equal.[4] Consequently, there will be upward pressure on the number of housing units demanded per person in the population.\n\nSecond, age-specific headship rates have been declining for the past few decades for every adult age group.[5] One plausible explanation for declining headship rates is the rising housing costs detailed in the previous section.\n\nFigure 5: Per-Age Headship Rates\n\nThe youngest groups have experienced the largest declines in headship rates. In 1980, 50 percent of Americans aged 25 to 34 were heads of their own household (the lowest line on Figure 4). In 2020, that number had fallen to around 40 percent. The headship rate for Americans aged 35 to 44 also fell substantially: from almost 55 percent to less than 50 percent. The decline in headship rates for younger Americans can be seen in the rise of young adults living at home over the same period, as shown in Figure 6. This rise is at least partially attributable to rising rents and house prices.[6]\n\nFigure 6. Share of Adults Aged 25 to 34 Living with a Parent\n\nIII. Housing demand has outpaced supply\n\nHousing demand growth since 2000 can be assessed by calculating the number of homes that would be required to accommodate the current U.S. population if headship rates for each age group had stayed at their 2000 values. The top line of Figure 7 shows that calculation, estimating that housing demand grew by 26 percent between 2000 and 2020.\n\nBy comparison, Figure 7 shows that the actual housing stock\u2014housing supply\u2014grew by only 19 percent. So, the growth in housing demand has outpaced supply\u2014a potentially important cause of rising rents and house prices. Population growth\u2014the bottom line in Figure 7\u2014grew by only 17 percent over this same period.\n\nIn short, housing cost increases have not arisen because population outpaced supply. It has not. Instead, housing cost increases have resulted from housing demand outpacing supply, driven in part by demographic shifts.\n\nFigure 7: Population, estimated housing demand, and housing stock percent growth since 2000\n\nIV. Why construction hasn\u2019t kept up pace and the role of policy\n\nSo why hasn\u2019t housing construction kept pace with the growth of housing demand? One cause of housing undersupply may be local land-use regulations and zoning restrictions.[7] Minimum lot sizes and limits on multifamily apartment buildings can increase prices by limiting supply.[8] Loosening those regulations would remove barriers to new construction, expand housing supply, and lower the rents faced by all households, including those with lower incomes.[9]\n\nIn many places, and for many low-income households, barriers to construction are not the sole culprit. Many households\u2019 incomes are simply too low to spur growth in the supply of reasonably safe and sanitary housing. The future rents they could afford to pay would be insufficient to cover the construction costs of new apartments or houses.[10] And new market-rate construction geared towards higher-income households only has limited success in opening affordable vacancies in older buildings.[11]\n\nGovernments\u2014state, local, and Federal\u2014have good reason to work towards overcoming these barriers to ensure a sufficient supply of affordable housing. Housing is a basic human need. Furthermore, investments in affordable housing support our economy\u2019s medium- and long-run growth. Having an affordable home allows workers to live close to the high-quality jobs where they are most productive, which is particularly important give the ongoing resurgence in American manufacturing.[12] Moreover, there is an abundance of evidence that stable housing provides benefits to children that increase their future long-term success.[13]\n\nGovernment policy can support housing supply and affordability in numerous ways: by subsidizing housing construction, by subsidizing renters, by subsidizing home buyers, and by incentivizing state and local governments to remove outdated zoning and land use policies.[14] One of the Federal government\u2019s largest sources of support for affordable housing is administered by Treasury: the Low Income Housing Tax Credit, or LIHTC, which subsidizes the construction and preservation of affordable housing.\n\nV. Biden-Harris and Treasury Policies\n\nThe Biden-Harris Administration and Treasury recognize the urgent need to address housing affordability. In 2022, the Biden-Harris Administration released a Housing Supply Action Plan, which included actions across multiple agencies intended to create more affordable housing. In its latest budget, the Biden Administration has called on Congress to invest more than $175 billion to help grow housing supply, including through the expansion of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit. The Administration has also encouraged state and local governments to work to reduce barriers to more housing construction.\n\nIn the meantime, Treasury is not waiting for Congress to act. Over the past few years, Treasury\u2019s American Rescue Plan programs have enabled state and local governments to deploy billions of dollars to create new and improve existing affordable housing stock. Treasury has also supported the construction of affordable housing through the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, the largest source of financing for affordable housing in the country, as well as Treasury\u2019s support for community development financial institutions and minority depository institutions, which enable these institutions to make housing loans and investments to communities hit hardest by the pandemic. Earlier this year, in a blog post, Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo announced a range of Treasury actions to help expand housing supply.\n\nToday, Secretary Janet Yellen is announcing several additional key housing initiatives in a speech in Minnesota. First, Treasury will be establishing a new program administered by the CDFI Fund that will provide an additional $100 million over the next three years to support the financing of affordable housing. Second, we are working on a major improvement to bolster the Federal Financing Bank\u2019s financing of affordable housing through its support of HUD\u2019s Section 542 Housing Finance Agency Risk-Sharing Initiative. This builds on the recent indefinite extension of the program, which is estimated to help preserve or create 38,000 affordable units over the next decade. Third, we are engaging with the Federal Home Loan Banks, which play a key role in the housing finance system, to explore ways that they can increase their voluntary commitments to housing programs. And fourth, the CDFI Fund is updating the Capital Magnet Fund rule to provide greater flexibility and reduce administrative burden on recipients, which reflects input that Treasury has received from stakeholders.\n\nThere will not be a quick fix to the long-term rise in housing costs. But the Federal and state and local governments play an important role in ensuring that all Americans have affordable and safe homes. The actions taken now are an important start, and the Administration is prioritizing laying the groundwork for larger legislative action when Congress is ready to act.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Abortion Debate Shifts as Election Nears: \u2018Now It\u2019s About Pregnancy\u2019\nIn the decades that Roe v. Wade was the law of the land, abortion rights groups tried to shore up support for it by declaring \u201cAbortion Is Health Care.\u201d\n\nOnly now, two years after the Supreme Court eliminated the constitutional right to abortion, and just six months before the presidential election, has the slogan taken on the force of reality.\n\nThe public conversation about abortion has grown into one about the complexities of pregnancy and reproduction, as the consequences of bans have played out in the news. The question is no longer just whether you can get an abortion, but also, Can you get one if pregnancy complications put you in septic shock? Can you find an obstetrician when so many are leaving states with bans? If you miscarry, will the hospital send you home to bleed? Can you and your partner do in vitro fertilization?\n\nThat shift helps explain why a record percentage of Americans are now declaring themselves single-issue voters on abortion rights \u2014 especially among Black voters, Democrats, women and those ages 18 to 29. Republican women are increasingly saying their party\u2019s opposition to abortion is too extreme, and Democrats are running on the issue after years of running away from it.",

        "text": "Unraveling the Mysteries of Biden vs. Trump on Health Care\nWe released one of our traditional \u201cside by sides\u201d today comparing President Biden and President Trump on health care. We have done this for every election cycle. This time, however, it was an especially tricky assignment.\n\nTrump avoids policy and policy details, both as a personal characteristic and a way to duck accountability and media criticism. The directions he might take have to be deduced from remarks he has made here and there, positions he took when he was president, and most of all, from the policy positions conservative Republican organizations have taken. Many are led by folks who would take up posts in a second Trump administration. The tricky part is that we can\u2019t know for sure if Trump will embrace the policy plans hatched by several conservative groups, if he is elected president. And Trump himself isn\u2019t saying.\n\nThe \u201cmaybe I will, maybe I won\u2019t\u201d posture has become the official position of the Trump campaign. According to the Washington Post:\n\nThe Trump campaign has distanced itself from the extensive planning. Campaign managers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita said in a statement, \u201cUnless a message is coming directly from President Trump or an authorized member of his campaign team, no aspect of future presidential staffing or policy announcements should be deemed official.\u201d\n\n(For this reason, unless Trump has endorsed a policy proposal, we have not included it in our side by side.\n\nBiden has certainly articulated clearer policy positions and some specific policies, and has generally pressed the advantage he has with voters on health, but he is not running on big new plans for health care. Rather, he focuses on incremental policies that resonate with voters and distinguish him as the candidate who cares about health care, such as adding more drugs to the Medicare drug price negotiation list, extending the $35 cap on insulin copays and $2,000 cap on out-of-pocket costs from Medicare to private coverage, and continuing enhanced ACA subsidies which are set to expire.\n\nWhat we are left with, then, is providing the best discernable analysis of the differences between the two candidates. Their differences tend to be articulated, covered by the press and digested by Congress policy by policy and program by program. That worm\u2019s eye view is the most relevant to ongoing debate and that\u2019s how we have analyzed the differences between Biden and Trump on health care in our side by side. From the bird\u2019s eye view, however, the differences are bigger, amounting to a fork in the road in direction on the role of the federal government in health and federal health spending. Conservative Republicans envision, and will try to sell Trump on, an agenda that would dramatically dial back the federal role in health while expanding the role of states and market choices. Deep cuts in federal health spending would accompany these changes. By contrast (and also in contrast to the Medicare for All agenda of the progressive left), Biden will try to build incrementally on recent expansions in public programs: Medicaid, the ACA and Medicare. Biden\u2019s approach is not small ball, nor is it sweeping health system reform; it\u2019s an aggressive form of incrementalism.\n\nThen there is abortion. The difference in direction on abortion and reproductive health is so stark and has been so widely discussed it does not need to be described again. However, how fully Trump would prosecute the conservative Republican agenda on abortion and reproductive health is at least something of an open question. Most recently, he has said abortion policy should be a matter left to the states.\n\nWhether dramatic policy changes could be achieved is an entirely different matter that depends on who controls Congress, who is appointed to high positions, public opinion, positioning for the next midterm election, and much more. What follows are some of the key health policy flashpoints.\n\nWith Trump\u2019s pledge not to cut Medicare, it\u2019s likely that the main action to cut federal spending and reduce the federal role in health will focus on Medicaid and the ACA (stopping short of another effort at repeal). The Republican Study Committee has proposed a complex series of block grants, combining ACA subsidies and Medicaid coverage, that they estimate will reduce federal spending by $4.5 trillion dollars over ten years. A cut of that magnitude sounds fantastical and would decimate coverage for the more than 100 million lower income people who get it from Medicaid and the ACA now. It would certainly be pared back in legislative negotiations. Just as certainly, the implementation of any law of this kind would be delayed in a bargain for support from current Republican governors, so that federal funding cuts hit their states when they are out of office. Providers would strongly oppose the cuts, which would erode their reimbursement rates. A Medicaid/ACA coverage block grant like this could be the main drama in health policy following a Trump election. With Medicaid as far reaching and as popular as it is today, and the magnitude of the cuts contemplated, even with a Republican trifecta producing control of Congress and the White House, odds of passage are iffy. It might garner more support if Republicans decided to sacrifice their spending reduction goals for their ideological and policy objectives.\n\nTrump\u2019s squishy \u201cno Medicare cuts\u201d campaign pledge notwithstanding, it should not be assumed that Medicare is off the hook. The same Republican groups are again proposing converting Medicare to a premium support or voucher-like program. How such a program would affect beneficiaries and federal spending turns mightily on details and can be subject to argument and competing analysis. Is the voucher tied to the lowest cost plan or a better plan than that? How would the value of the voucher increase over time? Are the plan\u2019s architects more interested in federal savings or the policy goal of further privatizing Medicare? Trump is famously averse to immersing himself in policy details and could choose to interpret a premium support plan in ways that he believes honor his campaign promises. Politically, however, Medicare is a health care issue in a league of its own. Midterms start to rear their heads quickly and Republicans will not want to hand democrats Medicare\u2014or what they call MediScare\u2014as a central issue.\n\nIn our candidate comparison, we describe the differences between Trump and Biden on abortion and reproductive health. There is a tension between the old New York Trump and the current MAGA Trump on abortion and reproductive health, and it\u2019s impossible to say where a Trump no longer running for election would land when conservatives attempt to ram home more severe restrictions on abortion or contraception or any aspect of reproductive health. He certainly would not stonewall them, but he might not embrace 100% of their agenda either.\n\nA tricky area in which to decipher differences is drug costs. Trump himself has never been a fan of the drug companies and took them on in his first term. He has promised to issue an executive order on drug prices he may or may not have the authority to issue. But Republicans would want to roll back the Biden regulatory measures to rein in some drug costs and certainly would not expand them. This area more than most underscores how challenging it is to analyze the positions of a presidential candidate who doesn\u2019t take positions and may or may not follow the plans laid out for him by conservative groups whose members will populate his administration.\n\nThere are many other differences on other health and health-related issues, from gun violence to substance use to LBGTQ issues to global health, all covered in the side by side.\n\nShould President Biden win re-election, you may also see a re-emergence of more expansive proposals from the left, including a re-emergence of Medicare for All proposals. The Democratic left has largely held its fire and supported Biden\u2019s health policies while worried about the Trump threat.\n\nThe states also bear watching. Generally ideological purity fades to budgetary interest for governors when they learn how federal legislation will affect their state. But governors and legislatures have become even more partisan and ideological, and past patterns may no longer hold.\n\nTypically, during an election campaign, large teams vying for jobs and working to satisfy constituency groups for campaigns prepare policy plans on virtually every health issue, posting them on a candidate\u2019s website. Once elected, candidates can be expected to put most of those plans into the legislative process and to implement what they can administratively. This time, with a president running for re-election whose policies are already set, and a former president who shuns policy details, both camps are skipping over the usual policy planning process, and the routine job of describing the differences between the two candidates on health issues is a thousand-piece puzzle.",

        "text": "Message for U.S. Citizens Voting in the 2024 U.S. Election\nTo vote in the November 2024 election, U.S. citizens overseas need to have completed a Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) in 2024. Whether you are a first-time voter or have already received ballots and voted absentee in past elections, you must complete an FPCA each calendar year to ensure you can participate in elections as an overseas absentee voter.\n\nContactless ballot drop-off is now available from 8 A.M. to 12 P.M on Tuesdays and Thursdays. When you arrive at the Consular entrance, please inform the guards that you would like to submit a ballot. You may also submit your completed ballots sealed in an envelope with the address of your local election officials to U.S. Embassy Moscow (Attn: American Citizen Services, 8 Bolshoy Devyatinskiy Per. Moscow 121099) through Pony Express or local mail, though please note that local mail can often take several months to arrive at the Embassy, resulting in a late submission of your ballot. Your physical ballot must be received by one month prior to the election in order to allow sufficient time for postal service. While we will send later submissions, we cannot reasonably expect their on-time arrival to your voting district.\n\nEven if you have never voted while overseas before, the process is easy.\n\n1. Request your ballot. Complete a new Federal Post Card Application (FPCA). You must complete a new FPCA after January 1, 2024, to ensure you receive your ballot for the 2024 elections. Submitting the FPCA allows you to request absentee ballots for all elections for federal offices (President, U.S. Senate, and U.S. House of Representatives) including primaries and special elections during the calendar year in which it is submitted. All local election officials in all U.S. states and territories accept the FPCA.\n\nYou can complete the FPCA online at FVAP.gov. The online voting assistant will ask you questions specific to your state. We encourage you to request your blank ballots be delivered electronically (by email, internet download, or fax, depending on your state). Include your email address on your FPCA to take advantage of the electronic ballot delivery option. Return the FPCA per the instructions on the website. The online voting assistant will tell you if your state allows the FPCA to be returned electronically or if you must submit a paper copy with original ink signature. If you must return a paper version, please follow the same instructions below for returning your ballot.\n\n2. Receive and complete your ballot. States are required to send out ballots 45 days before a regular election for federal office and generally send ballots at least 30 days before primary elections. For most states, you can confirm your registration and ballot delivery online.\n\n3. Return your completed ballot. While some states allow you to return your completed ballot electronically, others do not. If your state requires you to return paper voting forms or ballots to local election officials, you can do so free of charge at the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate. Place your ballot in a postage-paid return envelope, or in an envelope bearing sufficient domestic U.S. postage, and address it to the relevant local election officials.\n\nResearch candidates and issues. Please see the FVAP links page for resources you can use to research candidates and issues. FVAP regularly sends information about election dates and deadlines through their Voting Alerts. Email vote@fvap.gov to subscribe or follow FVAP on Facebook or Twitter.\n\n\n\nLearn more at the Federal Voting Assistance Program\u2019s (FVAP) website, FVAP.gov. If you have any questions about the process of voting while overseas, please contact U.S. Embassy Moscow\u2019s Voting Assistance Officer at moscowacs@state.gov.\n\nRemember, your vote counts!",

        "text": "As Biden and Trump prep for the 2024 presidential debate, what\u2019s at stake?\nAfter facing each other in two 2020 debates, Biden and Trump are set for a rematch as they seek to pull ahead in the 2024 race.\n\nWashington, DC \u2013 It began with a quote made famous by actor Clint Eastwood.\n\n\u201cMake my day,\u201d United States President Joe Biden said in a video challenging his Republican adversary, former President Donald Trump, to two debates in the lead-up to the 2024 presidential election. The first airs this Thursday.\n\nIn throwing down the gauntlet, Biden gave Trump, who has long boasted of his prowess on the debate stage, an offer he could hardly refuse. Trump soon responded with his own bravado: \u201cI\u2019m ready to go anywhere that you are.\u201d\n\nThe back-and-forth ended speculation that the octogenarian Biden and septuagenarian Trump may forgo the nationally broadcast debates, in favour of more controlled, less combative settings for spreading their campaign messages \u2014 like rallies, for instance.\n\nGoing head to head is a political calculation that carries high risks, according to Aaron Kall, the director of the debate programme at the University of Michigan.\n\nBut it could also be the key to pulling ahead in a stagnant race, one where polls show Trump and Biden closely matched. Even Trump\u2019s historic criminal conviction has done little to tip the scales.\n\n\u201cBoth of the candidates think that it will be advantageous having their opponent be seen by the public for an extended period of time, especially for voters that may not normally tune in,\u201d Kall told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cBut really, only one of them can be right.\u201d\n\nA history of face-offs\n\nThe debate may be the first of the 2024 presidential race, but it will be the third time Trump and Biden have gone head to head as presidential hopefuls: They faced each other previously in the 2020 elections.\n\n\u201cNeither have debated [since their last face-off], which is kind of unique,\u201d Kall said, noting that Trump skipped the Republican Party debates in the lead-up to the primaries this year.\n\n\u201cSo both of them will kind of be out of practice, not having debated since the fall of 2020, and it may take a little time to kind of get back into their regular debating styles,\u201d he said.\n\nFor both men, the forum has offered a mixed bag.\n\nIn 2016, when Trump made his first successful bid for public office, his raucous, combative and off-the-cuff debating style helped him gain notoriety in a crowded field of Republican presidential candidates.\n\nHis subsequent throwdown with Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton gained higher ratings than any other debate before or since. It drew an estimated 84 million viewers.\n\nCamera-ready from his days as a reality star, Trump gave insult-laden, physically foreboding showings that cemented his public persona and helped to build his electoral base, Kall explained. At one point during his face-off with Clinton, Trump even appeared to loom over her as she spoke.\n\nFor his part, Biden often failed to rise above the fray in crowded Democratic primary debates during his earlier runs for president. Still, experts say he has proved a worthy opponent in one-on-one vice presidential debates against Sarah Palin in 2008 and Paul Ryan in 2012.\n\nLeaning into his everyman appeal, Biden served as a plain-spoken and pugilistic attack dog on the debate stage, offering a counterpoint to the more refined Barack Obama, for whom he would serve as vice president.\n\nFast forward to September 2020, when then-incumbent Trump finally faced off against Biden.\n\nThe event quickly went off the rails, with Trump repeatedly shouting over both Biden and Fox News moderator Chris Wallace. As the evening devolved, Wallace assumed the role of exasperated babysitter. Trump came across as belligerent, Biden befuddled.\n\n\u201cWill you shut up, man?\u201d Biden appealed to Trump in one of the most memorable quotes from the event.\n\nNational Public Radio political correspondent Domenico Montanaro would later describe the evening as chaos, writing it may have been the \u201cworst\u201d presidential debate in history.\n\n\u201cIf this was supposed to be a boxing match, it instead turned into President Trump jumping on the ropes, refusing to come down, the referee trying to coax him off, and Joe Biden standing in the middle of the ring with his gloves on and a confused look on his face,\u201d Montanaro wrote.\n\nWhat is the motivation to participate?\n\nBut that first debate likely planted the seeds for Trump and Biden to spar again.\n\nKall said Biden likely hopes that the debate will showcase the increasingly radical rhetoric that is all too common at Trump\u2019s rallies \u2013 but may not be as visible to \u201cmoderates, independents, and soft supporters\u201d.\n\nAfter all, Trump infamously refused to condemn white supremacy during the first 2020 debate, instead telling the Proud Boys, a far-right group, to \u201cstand back and stand by\u201d.\n\nFor his part, Trump may hope that the length of the live proceedings will tax Biden\u2019s advanced age, Kall explained.\n\nThe ratings are expected to be high, despite the debate\u2019s unorthodox late-June scheduling. When Trump and Biden first debated in 2020, for instance, they brought in 73 million viewers, the third highest in history.\n\n\u201cFor the average, low-information voter, they don\u2019t tune in until closer to the election, but they may catch a debate,\u201d Kall said. \u201cSo these debates are one of the rare opportunities for more of the kind of casual person \u2014 that may vote but may not really be following the daily updates \u2014 to see these candidates for the first time in a long time.\u201d\n\nThe first 2020 debate between Biden and Trump has also cast a long shadow over the format of Thursday\u2019s debate, which will be hosted by CNN in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nThe candidates\u2019 microphones will be muted when they are not speaking. There will be no studio audience. Both those factors are widely seen to be in Biden\u2019s favour. The event will also not be overseen by the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, in a break from three decades of tradition.\n\nIssues of the economy, inflation and immigration are expected to loom large at the event, as are foreign policy questions about China, Ukraine and Israel\u2019s war in Gaza.\n\nThe debate moderators, Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, are also anticipated to raise the events of the 2020 presidential election: Trump has publicly maintained \u2014 without evidence \u2014 that the race was \u201cstolen\u201d through voter fraud.\n\nAnother possible topic for the debate is Trump\u2019s ongoing legal woes. The event comes less than a month after Trump was convicted in New York on 34 felony charges of falsifying business documents to cover up hush-money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels.\n\nThe verdict made Trump the first president, past or present, in US history to be found guilty on criminal charges. While Biden has tread carefully when addressing the trial \u2014 to avoid any appearance of involvement \u2014 his campaign released a new advertisement this month highlighting the conviction as evidence of Trump\u2019s character.\n\n\u201cThis election is between a convicted criminal who is only out for himself and a president who is fighting for your family,\u201d the advertisement\u2019s voiceover says.\n\nBut the verdict may also offer an opportunity for Trump, according to James Davis, a Republican strategist and founder of Touchdown Strategies.\n\nDavis pointed out that the jury\u2019s decision made only a small dent in Trump\u2019s base of support, and Republican officials have largely denounced the conviction as politicised.\n\nThe debate offers Trump a stage to further that narrative, particularly among key demographics including young Black men, Davis added.\n\nHe recommended that Trump should try to connect his conviction to the First Step Act, a bill he signed in 2018 to cut excessively long federal prison sentences.\n\n\u201cHe can say, \u2018I\u2019ve known that the justice system doesn\u2019t treat people fairly across the board \u2026 and that\u2019s why I passed the First Step Act, because it\u2019s been treating minority and Black communities unfairly for years,\u2019\u201d Davis told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cIf he can keep it clean and message-focused, he can do well,\u201d he added. \u201cBut if he appears to lean more into the Trump revenge tour, then that will ultimately substantiate some of the arguments against him that Biden has been making.\u201d\n\nFor Biden, Democratic strategist Kristian Ramos said the debate offers an opportunity to cut through negative perceptions of the country\u2019s economic performance: Biden could, for instance, tout the policies he signed to create jobs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for him to tell the story of the last three years and what he\u2019s done and how he can help the American people,\u201d Ramos told Al Jazeera.\n\nHe also pointed to polls that have shown some independent voters drifting away from Trump after his conviction. That demographic could be key to deciding the election.\n\n\u201cIt still may be a bridge too far for many voters,\u201d Ramos said of Trump\u2019s conviction. \u201cSo this is an opportunity for Biden to tell that story to those voters and to reach them through the debate.\u201d",

        "text": "New Information Shows CIA Contractors Colluded with the Biden Campaign to Discredit Hunter Biden Laptop Story\nToday, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the House Committee on the Judiciary, and the Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government released a joint interim staff report titled, \u201cThe Intelligence Community 51: How CIA Contractors Colluded with The Biden Campaign to Mislead American Voters.\u201d\n\nThe report reveals new information detailing how the highest levels of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), up to and including then-CIA Director Gina Haspel, were made aware of the \u201cPublic Statement on the Hunter Biden Emails\u201d by 51 former intelligence officials prior to its approval and publication. The report reveals important new facts, such as how some of the statement's signatories, including former Deputy CIA Director Michael Morell, were on active contract with the CIA at the time they issued the Hunter Biden statement to discredit damaging allegations about Biden family influence peddling just weeks before the 2020 presidential election.\n\n\u201cThe House Intelligence Committee\u2019s work provided us with solid direct evidence that in the final weeks before the 2020 presidential election, 51 former intelligence officials coordinated with the Biden campaign to falsely cast doubt on an explosive New York Post story and label Hunter Biden\u2019s abandoned laptop as \u2018Russian disinformation.\u2019 The Committee worked to obtain classified documents from the CIA, including emails, and fought to include evidence of these materials in our report,\u201d said Chairman Mike Turner.\n\n\u201cWe knew that the rushed statement from the 51 former intelligence officials was a political maneuver between the Biden campaign and the intelligence community. Now with this interim report, we reveal how officials at the highest levels of the CIA were aware of the statement and CIA employees knew that several of the so-called former officials were on active contract with the CIA. The report underscores the risks posed by a weaponized federal government,\u201d said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan.\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nOn October 14, 2020, the New York Post published a report detailing how Hunter Biden used the position and influence of his father, now-President Joe Biden, for personal gain with the apparent awareness of President Biden. Five days later, on October 19, 2020, 51 former intelligence officials signed on to a public statement that stated that the Hunter Biden laptop story had \u201call the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation,\u201d in an attempt to discredit the New York Post\u2019s reporting.\n\nSince April 2022\u2014and renewed in January 2023, when Republicans resumed control of the House of Representatives\u2014the Committees have been conducting oversight into the origins of this statement. The Committees wrote to all 51 former officials requesting relevant documents and testimony.\n\nThe Committee\u2019s first joint interim staff report revealed how the now-infamous and discredited Hunter Biden statement originated with a call from top Biden campaign official\u2014and now Secretary of State\u2014Antony Blinken to former Deputy CIA Director Michael Morell to provide talking points and cover for the Biden campaign to discredit serious allegations about the Biden family\u2019s influence peddling. Morell's testimony also exposed that the goal of the statement was to aid President Biden in the final debate of the 2020 presidential campaign.\n\nNEW INFORMATION:\n\nThe highest officials within the CIA were aware of the statement prior to its publication. CIA\u2019s Chief Operating Officer (COO) Andrew Makridis testified that he informed Director Gina Haspel or Deputy Director Vaughn Frederick Bishop about its impending release. This sequence of events suggests that senior CIA leadership had ample opportunity to assess the validity of the statement's claims. Furthermore, the COO\u2019s office appeared to signal approval of the statement in a move that departed from standard Prepublication Classification Review Board (PCRB) protocols.\n\nAdditionally, some of the statement\u2019s signatories were on active contract with the CIA at the time they issued the statement to discredit damaging allegations about Biden family influence peddling. Despite claiming they lacked access to classified information at the time, at least two signatories\u2014Michael Morell and former CIA Inspector General David Buckley\u2014were actively working for the CIA as contractors. This revelation raises concerns that these officials may have abused their positions to expedite the statement's approval and may have been earning taxpayer dollars while they did it.\n\nFurthermore, officials within the CIA recognized at the time that the Hunter Biden statement was political and would hurt the Agency. The signatories\u2019 decision to leverage their former intelligence community titles to promote a narrative about foreign election interference improperly embroiled the Agency in domestic politics. This report underscores the potential dangers of a politicized intelligence community.\n\nRead the full interim staff report here.",

        "text": "Cox Automotive Research: With a National Election Approaching, the U.S. Auto Industry Enters a Season of Uncertainty\nNew research released today by Cox Automotive, the world\u2019s largest automotive services and technology provider, reveals that nearly 75% of automobile shoppers in the market for a vehicle expect the outcome of the U.S. presidential election in November to impact the economy.\n\nThe findings underscore a high level of uncertainty in the auto market \u2013 across both major political parties and among dealers and shoppers \u2013 caused partly by expectations that the November election will reshape the economy, change interest rates, or impact inflation. Due to the anticipation of future changes, many shoppers may be adopting a wait-and-see attitude, choosing to stay on the sidelines until a more certain economic direction is established. Additionally, 78% of respondents told Cox Automotive that they expect the November election to influence their decision-making when it comes to making a big-ticket purchase other than an automobile.\n\n\u201cIf shoppers believe interest rates will be lower in the future, or that the economy will be improving \u2013 or worsening \u2013 post-election, they are more likely to stay on the sidelines, waiting for the dust to settle,\u201d said Vanessa Ton, senior manager, Research and Market Intelligence, Cox Automotive. \u201cThis new research reminds us that elections breed uncertainty, and when big-ticket purchases like automobiles are on the line, uncertainty is the enemy.\u201d\n\nThe key takeaways from the study include:\n\nNearly 3 in 4 consumers expect the upcoming U.S. presidential election to impact the economy. A notable 66% of consumers and 82% of dealers feel the outcome of the election will affect interest rates. Inflation is the No. 1 concern among shoppers, with 74% of consumers and 81% of dealers believing the next election will influence it. According to 60% of consumers, the November election will affect their next vehicle purchase. Most consumers feel the election will not impact their powertrain decisions; the majority are opposed to government mandates on electric vehicles.\n\nThe study \u2013 Automotive Shopping and a National Election: A Season of Uncertainty \u2013 was conducted in February and includes interviews with more than 500 in-market vehicle shoppers. Of the respondents, 91% were likely to vote in the coming election. Additionally, in late April and early May, 1,026 new and used automobile dealers across the U.S. were surveyed.\n\nAuto Dealers, More than Shoppers, Expect Change\n\nInterestingly, this research found that automobile dealers are more likely than vehicle shoppers to believe the election will impact the economy. Significantly, more dealers expect interest rates \u2013 which many believe are the top factor holding back business \u2013 will change post-election. More than shoppers, dealers expect inflation to get worse after the election.\n\nBoth shoppers and dealers expect the election to change the economic landscape \u2013 the overall economy, interest rates and inflation \u2013 but fewer believe it will impact consumer spending or vehicle sales. Still, 62% of shoppers feel the election will affect consumer spending, with 38% expecting spending to improve. Meanwhile, 53% of consumers expect vehicle sales to be impacted, but only 21% expect sales to get worse. Thirty-two percent expect improvement; 47% expect no impact.\n\nAuto dealers are more pessimistic about consumer spending and vehicle sales: Nearly half of dealers polled expect consumer spending to worsen, and 38% expect vehicle sales to worsen. With vehicle sales, an equal number of dealers believe the election will have no impact or believe sales will improve after the election \u2013 each at (31%). Auto dealers are also far more likely to believe that the election will impact car loan interest rates and the types of vehicles automakers manufacture.\n\n\u201cWith this research, we were surprised by the low percentage of respondents that expected \u2018no change\u2019 come November,\u201d added Ton. \u201cAcross both party affiliations, with dealers and shoppers alike, there are expectations that changes are coming.\u201d\n\nMany Believe Vehicle Prices Will Change, Powertrain Consideration Won\u2019t\n\nThe study finds that nearly 70% of shoppers believe that vehicle prices will change due to the election, with 41% expecting prices to rise. Only 26% of shoppers expect prices to fall after the November election. Thirty-three percent believe the election will have no impact on vehicle prices. A majority of shoppers (52%) expect the election outcome not to affect their decisions to buy luxury or non-luxury, and slightly more (57%) expect the election to have no impact on their decision about import or domestic brands.\n\nShoppers are also in general agreement (61%) that the November election will NOT impact what powertrains they will consider, and a majority of shoppers (54%) disagree with the statement, \u201cThe government should mandate consumers to purchase electric vehicles.\u201d Only 22% of respondents to the Cox Automotive study agree with the electric vehicle mandate statement.\n\nAuto Dealers React to Coming Election\n\nAdditional research undertaken in late April and early May, as part of the quarterly Cox Automotive Dealer Sentiment Index, found that automobile dealers in the U.S. believe that the political climate ahead of the November election is increasingly becoming a factor holding back business.\n\nIn the Q2 2024 report, when asked about factors holding back business, auto dealers remained focused on Interest Rates, the Economy, and Market Conditions, respectively, with minimal change from Q1 and one year ago. However, with the U.S. presidential election approaching, Political Climate continues to increase as a factor affecting business.\n\nIn fact, while concerns about interest rates have come down slightly quarter over quarter, concerns over the political climate have increased. In Q2, 36% of dealers in the U.S. \u2013 both franchised and independent dealers \u2013 cite Political Climate as a factor holding back business, up from 33% in Q1 and 29% one year ago.\n\nCox Automotive Chief Economist Jonathan Smoke commented, \u201cIn many ways, the political climate is a surrogate for \u2018uncertainty.\u2019 Many dealers and consumers believe the election outcome will impact the economy in some way \u2013 either good or bad \u2013 and that expectation of change is causing paralysis in the market and hurting sentiment.\u201d\n\nMore than independents, franchised dealers \u2013 those that sell both new and used vehicles \u2013 feel that the political climate is holding back business. At 41%, Political Climate is now ranked No. 3 on the list of top 10 factors affecting business. Independent dealers are slightly less concerned about the political climate, as they prioritize Expenses (No. 4) and Credit Availability (No. 5). For independent dealers, Political Climate ranks No. 6, at 34%, up one percentage point from Q1.",

        "text": "The 2024 Presidential Race and the Nuclear Weapons Threat\nVolume 16, Issue 3\n\nJune 25, 2024\n\nToday, nearly 80 years after the beginning of the nuclear age, the risks posed by nuclear weapons are escalating. U.S. presidential leadership may be the most important factor in whether the risk of nuclear arms racing, proliferation, and war will rise or fall in the years ahead.\n\nAs UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said in a June 7 statement: \u201cHumanity is on a knife's edge. The risk of a nuclear weapon being used has reached heights not seen since the Cold War. States are engaged in a qualitative arms race. [W]e need disarmament now. All countries need to step up, but nuclear weapons states must lead the way.\u201d\n\nNuclear weapons are not just a global concern. This week the United States Conference of Mayors unanimously adopted a new resolution, titled: \u201cThe Imperative of Dialogue in a Time of Acute Nuclear Dangers.\u201d\n\nAmerican voters are increasingly aware and, according to recent polling, deeply concerned about nuclear weapons dangers. A 2024 national opinion survey found that a majority of Americans believe that nuclear weapons make the world more dangerous. Overall, just one in eight Americans (13 percent) think nuclear weapons are making the world a safer place, while 63 percent think the opposite, and 14 percent say neither.\n\nIn 2024, the candidates\u2019 approaches to these dangers deserve more scrutiny.\n\nHow exactly the winner of the 2024 race will handle the evolving array of nuclear weapons-related challenges is difficult to forecast. But the records and policies of the leading contenders, President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, offer some clues.\n\nThe Goal: Avoiding Nuclear War\n\nPerhaps the most consequential responsibility for a U.S. president, who has the sole authority to order the use of nuclear weapons, is to avoid events that could lead to a nuclear war.\n\nToday, there is a heightened risk of nuclear use involving Russia and its war on Ukraine, a serious risk of a conflict with nuclear-armed China over its claims to Taiwan, and plausible scenarios involving nuclear war with North Korea, which already may have the capability to hit the United States with a nuclear-armed ballistic missile\n\nEvery U.S. president in the nuclear age has faced at least one crisis that could have led to nuclear war. Each in their own way has realized, as Ronald Reagan put it in 1984, that \"a nuclear war cannot be one and must never be fought.\"\n\nAt a 2019 meeting of senior officials from the five nuclear-armed states recognized under the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), China proposed a joint statement reiterating that \u201ca nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.\u201d Trump administration officials objected, and the statement was not adopted. Two years later, in January 2022, Biden administration officials successfully pressed the group to reaffirm the statement, and they did.\n\nIn 2017, President Trump engaged in a months-long showdown with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that involved exchanges of harsh rhetoric and military moves and countermoves. At one point, on August 8, Trump promised Kim \"fire and fury\" if he conducted more ballistic missile tests. In his first address to the United Nations on Sept. 19, Trump said. \"... if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.\"\n\nIn interviews afterward, it was revealed that Trump and Kim thought that nuclear war almost broke out on the Korean Peninsula in 2017. Trump told Bob Woodward in an interview for his book, Rage, that war with Pyongyang was \u201cmuch closer than anyone would know.\u201d\n\nAfter Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale attack on Ukraine and issued threats of nuclear use, Biden also faced the specter of nuclear conflict. Since Russia's invasion, Biden has not issued nuclear counterthreats publicly and he has continued to back Ukraine in its struggle to repel Russia\u2019s invasion.\n\nThe risk of nuclear use became acute in late 2022 when Putin issued another nuclear threat suggesting that Moscow was considering using a nuclear weapon on the battlefield in Ukraine to freeze Russian gains and force Kyiv and its backers into submission.\n\nOn Oct. 6, Biden reportedly said at a fundraising event that \"for the first time since the Cuban Missile Crisis, we have a direct threat of the use of a nuclear weapon if in fact things continue down the path they\u2019ve been going.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with CBS News\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d Biden was asked what he would tell Putin if the Russian leader were considering using nuclear weapons against Ukraine. \u201cDon\u2019t. Don\u2019t. Don\u2019t,\u201d Biden said. \u201cYou will change the face of war unlike anything since World War II.\u201d\n\nBiden declined to detail how the United States would respond, saying only that the reaction would be \u201cconsequential\u201d and would depend \u201con the extent of what they do.\u201d\n\nBiden also dispatched CIA director William Burns to privately warn the Kremlin that \u201cthere would be clear consequences for Russia\" if Russia used nuclear weapons in Ukraine. U.S. officials privately pressed Chinese and Indian leaders to urge Putin to halt the nuclear threats, and they did.\n\nIn November 2022, Biden also joined leaders of the Group of 20 states meeting in Indonesia in declaring that the use of nuclear weapons and threats of their use are \u201cinadmissible.\u201d\n\nThe Biden and Trump Track Records on Arms Control with Russia and China\n\nEffective U.S. leadership on arms control will be critical to avoid a destabilizing, three-way arms race after the only remaining Russian-U.S. arms control agreement, the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), expires in 2026.\n\nThe Trump and Biden approaches to nuclear arms control have differed on paper and in practice.\n\nTrump's 2018 formal Nuclear Posture Review document states that \u201cthe United States will remain receptive to future arms control negotiations if conditions permit\u201d and if such accords \u201cadvance U.S. and allied security, are verifiable, and enforceable.\u201d It adds that the administration \u201cwill continue to pursue the political and security conditions that could enable further nuclear reductions.\u201d\n\nBiden's 2022 Nuclear Posture Review report states that the United States \u201cwill seek opportunities to pursue practical steps to advance the goals of greater transparency and predictability, enhanced stability, reduced reliance on nuclear weapons and, ultimately, a world without nuclear weapons.\u201d\n\nAs the first expiration deadline for New START approached on Feb. 5, 2021, Trump's team refused to agree to a simple 5-year extension of the pact. Instead, they said that the United States would contemplate only a short-term extension of the treaty \u2013 and only if Russia agreed to a framework for a new trilateral treaty that verifiably covers all nuclear warheads, includes those of China in the future, and makes changes to the painstakingly-negotiated New START verification regime\n\nAt one point, Trump's arms control envoy threatened that the United States could spend Russia and China \u201cinto oblivion\u201d in a new nuclear arms race if they did not agree to the U.S. proposals.\n\nThis left the incoming Biden administration only days after inauguration day to reach a deal with the Kremlin to extend the pact by five years, and it did in early 2021. After their summit in Geneva that year, Biden and Putin agreed to resume \"strategic stability\" talks, but these were suspended following Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn June 2023, the Biden administration proposed talks with Russia \u201cwithout preconditions\u201d on a new, post-2026 \u201cnuclear arms control framework.\u201d In his September 2023 speech to the UN, Biden reiterated that \u201cno matter what else is happening in the world, the United States is ready to pursue critical arms control measures.\u201d\n\nIn January 2024, however, Russia formally rejected the U.S. offer to re-open the nuclear arms control dialogue because, it said, the United States was seeking the strategic defeat of Russia through its support of Ukraine.\n\nRussia and the United States have pledged to stay within the limits set by New START (1,550 deployed strategic nuclear warheads) as long as it is in force and as long as the other side does the same. But without a new understanding to restrain their strategic arsenals after the treaty expires, the two countries could double the size of their deployed arsenals by uploading additional warheads on existing missiles.\n\nMany arms control experts believe that as long as there is war in Ukraine, the best outcome is a simple deal committing both sides to stay below the current limit of 1,550 deployed strategic warheads until a longer-term Russian-U.S. nuclear arms control framework agreement can be concluded.\n\nBiden also has pursued nuclear risk reduction talks with China, which continues a major nuclear buildup begun during the Trump era. Independent experts estimate China currently has some 500 nuclear weapons in total, including 310 on long-range, strategic systems. In November, senior Chinese and U.S. officials held the first nuclear risk reduction talks in years. However, China recently declined to resume talks on nuclear risk reduction.\n\nOn June 7, a senior White House official said: \u201c... we do not need to increase our nuclear forces to match or outnumber the combined total of our competitors to successfully deter them.\u201d But he added: \u201cAbsent a change in the trajectory of adversary arsenals, we may reach a point in the coming years where an increase from currently deployed numbers is required.\u201d\n\nSince leaving office, Trump has not spoken about his plan to reduce nuclear dangers (nor has he been asked to), but his former national security advisor, Robert O'Brien, wrote in a recent Foreign Affairs article: \"The United States has to maintain technical and numerical superiority to the combined Chinese and Russian nuclear stockpiles.\"\n\nThe United States has some 3,700 warheads in its active arsenal. This includes 1,670 thermonuclear warheads deployed on 660 powerful, long-range missiles on land and at sea, and that can be delivered on strategic bombers, plus another 100 \"tactical\" nuclear bombs on shorter-range aircraft according to independent estimates. Russia's deployed nuclear force is roughly equivalent in size. China is currently estimated to have some 500 nuclear weapons and 310 long-range, nuclear-armed ballistic missiles.\n\nThe use of just a fraction of these arsenals would lead to mass destruction on an unprecedented, global scale.\n\nMore Nuclear Weapons, More Spending?\n\nFor some 15 years, the United States has been pursuing an across-the-board effort to modernize, upgrade, and maintain its entire nuclear enterprise, including plans for:\n\na new land-based intercontinental-ballistic missile (the Sentinel ICBM); a new fleet of strategic subs (Columbia-class); a new fleet of strategic bombers (the B-21)\n\na new air-launched cruise missile (LRSO); a new sea-based cruise missile (SLCM-N)\n\nrefurbishment of all nuclear warhead types, a new-design warhead (the W-93), and two new plutonium pit production facilities that can produce 80 units per year.\n\nCosts have risen under the Trump administration and the Biden administration, which has led to calls for a re-evaluation of the effort.\n\nIn 2017, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that the plans Trump inherited from Obama to maintain and upgrade the arsenal over the next 30 years would cost $1.2 trillion in current dollars. In 2023, the cost estimate had risen to more than $1.5 trillion over the next 30 years.\n\nU.S. Nuclear Weapons Modernization Costs At-A-Glance CBO total cost est. Fiscal 2023-2032 $756 billion Fiscal 2025 Biden Request (DoD and NNSA activities) $69 billion (up 22%)\n\nAccording to CBO, the Department of Defense\u2019s (DoD\u2019s) and the Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE\u2019s) current plans call for spending more than $756 billion over the 2023\u20132032 period, or an average of just over $75 billion a year.\n\nNuclear weapons-related costs will likely grow even more. Some of these programs are more expensive than others, riskier, and more vulnerable to delay or cancellation.\n\nFor example, the Air Force announced in January that the new Sentinel ICBM would cost 37 percent more than expected and take about two years longer than planned to build and deploy. The cost hike puts the Sentinel program in a \u201ccritical\u201d breach of the Nunn-McCurdy Act, a law designed to prevent major cost overruns. The delay will increase the cost of extending the life of the 400 Minuteman III ICBMs now deployed in Colorado, Montana, Nebraska, N. Dakota, and Wyoming.\n\nSentinel Missile Program Costs At-A-Glance Original per unit price for the Sentinel $118 million Current per unit price for the Sentinel $162 million Estimated 10-year program cost, incl. 450 new launch facilities $120 billion Estimated 50-year life-cycle cost $320 billion Estimated cost for new W87-1 warhead for the Sentinel $15 billion\n\nTrump said on Feb. 12, 2018, that the United States is \u201ccreating a brand-new nuclear force. [W]e\u2019re gonna be so far ahead of everybody else in nuclear like you\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d\n\nDuring the Trump years, nuclear modernization costs grew, and his administration proposed \"supplements\" to the nuclear force to give the president more nuclear options.\n\nAs a candidate, Joe Biden pledged \"to maintain a strong, credible deterrent while reducing our reliance and excessive expenditure on nuclear weapons.\" Under his leadership, however, costs have also grown. His fiscal year 2025 budget request calls for $69 billion for nuclear weapons operations, sustainment, and modernization, which is 22 percent higher than last year.\n\nBiden has supported the Obama-era \"program of record\" to replace and upgrade existing nuclear weapons systems and has opposed a Trump-era proposal for a new nuclear-armed, sea-launched cruise missile. However, Congress has mandated that a program must be established for the weapon.\n\nAdditional cost increases could crowd out funding for other critical, non-nuclear defense programs. Further delays with the Sentinel missile and Columbia-class strategic sub could lead to changes to the existing nuclear force structure. Nevertheless, several Republican members of Congress are advocating for an even more ambitious and costly nuclear modernization and expansion effort involving:\n\nsignificantly increasing the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads (now numbering 1,439) by uploading more warheads on ICBMs\n\nincreasing the number of ICBM silos from 400 to 450\n\nputting a large portion of the strategic bomber force back on continuous nuclear alert status\n\ndeveloping and building a new SLCM-N and associated warhead\n\nconsidering building an additional strategic submarine\n\nHow a second Biden administration or a second Trump administration might pursue these ideas and manage the cost and security challenges is not clear.\n\nNuclear Testing\n\nThe 1996 Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), which the United States has signed but not ratified, effectively brought an end to the era of nuclear explosive testing.\n\nHowever, concerns about a possible nuclear testing revival are on the rise as China, Russia, and the United States modernize their arsenals and continue to engage in nuclear activities at their former nuclear testing sites.\n\nThe vast majority of the 2,056 nuclear test explosions conducted between 1945 and 2017 (including 1,030 by the United States) were to proof-test new warhead designs. Only North Korea has conducted nuclear tests in this century.\n\nThe Trump administration declared in 2018 that the United States did not intend to ratify the CTBT and it shortened the time necessary to resume nuclear testing from 24-36 months to 6-10 months.\n\nIn May 2020, senior Trump officials reportedly discussed the idea of the United States resuming nuclear testing in order to intimidate China and Russia into accepting U.S. terms at the negotiating table. The U.S. House of Representatives responded by voting to bar funding for any such action.\n\nDuring the 2020 campaign, Biden called the idea of resuming nuclear testing \u201cas reckless as it is dangerous,\u201d and said, \u201cWe have not tested a device since 1992; we don\u2019t need to do so now.\u201d\n\nThe Biden administration has reaffirmed U.S. support for the treaty but has not taken steps to secure Senate advice and consent for ratification. Senior Biden officials have said there is no technical or military need to resume nuclear testing due to the success of the U.S. stockpile stewardship program. The head of the National Nuclear Security Administration has proposed technical talks with Beijing and Moscow on confidence-building arrangements at the former Chinese, Russian, and U.S. test sites to ensure that their subcritical nuclear experiments are not full-scale tests, which would violate the CTBT.\n\nIn his recent Foreign Affairs article, O\u2019Brien, one of Trump\u2019s former national security advisors, suggested that the United States should resume testing. \"Washington must test new nuclear weapons for reliability and safety in the real world for the first time since 1992\u2014not just by using computer models,\" he wrote.\n\nPutin has pledged to resume nuclear testing if the United States does, and it is possible that China, which has conducted 45 nuclear tests compared to 1,030 by the United States, also would respond in kind.\n\nPreventing a Nuclear-Armed Iran\n\nU.S. presidents have been seeking to contain Iran's sensitive nuclear activities since the 1990s.\n\nIn 2018, the Trump administration withdrew unilaterally from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and imposed tougher U.S. sanctions to try to pressure Tehran into negotiating a new and \"better\" deal..Since then, Iranian leaders have increased their capabilities to produce weapons-grade uranium significantly and curtailed cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency. As a result, Iran would need only weeks to amass enough highly enriched uranium for one bomb, as opposed to more than a year under the 2015 nuclear deal)\n\nBiden pledged to restore mutual compliance with the 2015 deal but so far has not and few experts believe the agreement can be revived at this point. The effort was stymied by Iranian demands on matters outside the nuclear file and tensions over the war in Gaza.\n\nIranian and U.S. officials continue backchannel talks on how to deescalate tensions, but Iran has threatened to pull out of the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty if the United States or other UN Security Council members snap back international sanctions against Iran as most former Trump advisers have proposed.\n\nAvoiding a more severe crisis over Iran\u2019s nuclear program will require more sophisticated U.S. diplomacy.\n\nManaging the North Korean Threat\n\nFor decades, U.S. presidents have sought to use a combination of diplomacy and sanctions to curb North Korea's capability to produce bomb-grade nuclear material, nuclear weapons, and sophisticated missiles that can deliver them. At some points, these efforts have been successful. At other stages, not so much. Today, North Korea has a relatively small but deadly nuclear arsenal and a variety of missiles that can be used to deliver them, including long-range missiles that can reach the United States.\n\nStrongman leader Kim has ramped up North Korean nuclear and missile development and stiff-armed overtures for talks with the Trump administration and the Biden administration ever since the disastrous 2019 summit in Hanoi, when Trump flatly rejected Kim\u2019s offer to dismantle North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear complex in return for limited sanctions relief, then walked out of the meeting.\n\nRenewed talks to try to curb North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons and ballistic program and lower tensions will require a recalibration of the U.S. approach and coordinated action by U.S. allies and very likely China.\n\nBottom Line\n\nGiven what is at stake, the voting public deserves to know more about how every presidential candidate plans to address the nuclear danger.",

        "text": "FACT SHEET: President Biden\u2019s Presidential Proclamation and Joint DHS-DOJ Interim Final Rule Cut Encounters at Southwest Border by Over 40 Percent in First Three Weeks\nThe Presidential Proclamation issued by President Biden to temporarily suspend the entry of certain noncitizens across the Southern border and the complementary joint interim final rule (IFR) issued by DHS and DOJ have now been in effect for three weeks, resulting in a significant reduction in the number of encounters at our Southwest Border. Under the IFR, asylum eligibility is generally limited for those who cross the southern border unlawfully or without authorization during times of high encounters. While it is still early, the Border Patrol\u2019s 7-day encounter average has decreased more than 40 percent to under 2,400 encounters per day.\n\nThese executive actions are no substitute for Congressional action. Twice now, Congress has failed to pass the bipartisan border security agreement negotiated in the U.S. Senate, which would have provided the critical personnel and funding needed to further secure our Southern border. The agreement would have added 1,500 U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Agents and Officers, added 1,200 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) personnel, invested in technology to catch illegal fentanyl, and delivered sweeping reforms to the asylum system. Congress must still act.\n\nEnhanced Enforcement and Consequences\n\nNoncitizens who are subject to the rule\u2019s limitation on asylum eligibility and who do not establish a legal basis to remain in the United States are being promptly removed. Those removed are subject to at least a five-year bar to reentry and potential criminal prosecution.\n\nDHS personnel at CBP, ICE, and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) have quickly operationalized and implemented the Proclamation and IFR over the past three weeks, with notable impacts including:\n\nAverage daily encounters by Border Patrol at the Southwest Border are below 2,400 per day, the lowest level of encounters since January 17, 2021, but still above the level that would lift the suspension under the Proclamation and IFR.\n\nDHS has removed and returned more than 24,000 individuals to more than 20 countries, including by operating more than 100 international repatriation flights.\n\nDHS has doubled the percentage of noncitizens removed or returned directly from Border Patrol custody.\n\nDHS has doubled the share of encounters processed through Expedited Removal while in USBP or ICE custody. Expedited Removal processing was already at record levels prior to the Declaration.\n\nDHS has decreased the number of people released pending their removal proceedings by over 65 percent.\n\nWe continue to implement recently announced measures to increase the overall capacity of enforcement resources \u2014 including repatriation flights and detention capacity. ICE is optimizing air charter contracts to ensure the maximum amount of repatriation flights can be effectuated weekly. Over the past year, ICE averaged 29 repatriation flights per week. Record numbers of flights have been enabled by continued diplomatic efforts to significantly expand the number of countries to which ICE is able to regularly remove individuals.\n\nOver the last year, the agency has conducted removal flights to a range of South American and Eastern Hemisphere countries, including Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Egypt, Mauritania, Senegal, Uzbekistan, and India. Efforts to expand the number of removal flights continue with the expectation of additional flights added to the schedule in the coming weeks.\n\nICE ERO is adjusting existing detention facility contracts to expand the number of beds in its detention network.\n\nPublic Safety\n\nThe Presidential Proclamation and IFR have enhanced DHS\u2019s capacity for enforcement against individuals who pose a public safety or national security threat, such as gang members attempting to enter the country unlawfully or without authorization, because the IFR renders those individuals ineligible for asylum and enables their quick removal. With the 1,500 Border Patrol Agents and CBP Officers that the bipartisan border security agreement would add, DHS would be able to enhance enforcement even further.\n\nDHS has returned more Border Patrol agents to the field to undertake front line border security operations, enhancing DHS efforts to interdict individuals who pose a threat to public safety.\n\nto undertake front line border security operations, enhancing DHS efforts to interdict individuals who pose a threat to public safety. These efforts continue to expand and maximize DHS enforcement against individuals who pose a threat to our communities , including the announcement on May 9 of a Proposed Rule to apply statutory bars to asylum for individuals who pose a public safety concern earlier in the process, during the credible fear screening.\n\n, including the announcement on May 9 of a Proposed Rule to apply statutory bars to asylum for individuals who pose a public safety concern earlier in the process, during the credible fear screening. To identify individuals of concern, DHS uses a range of resources and information, including information shared by partners worldwide, to inform screening and vetting and to target such individuals attempting to come to United States. DHS works tirelessly to expand access to additional foreign records systems through new international agreements.\n\nAlong with law enforcement partners worldwide, DHS is constantly monitoring new and emerging threats, including the threat posed by criminal organizations that could present a concern to public safety. The Department conducts thorough screening and vetting for any individual that we encounter on the southern border who could be affiliated with these organizations.\n\nFor example, DHS has implemented enhanced screening measures at the border to identify known or suspected gang members, including members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Individuals confirmed to be gang members are required to be referred for criminal prosecution or placed into Expedited Removal and detained.\n\nHow it Works\n\nThe Presidential Proclamation suspends the entry of noncitizens across the southern U.S. border, which includes the Southwest land and the southern coastal borders, with certain exceptions. The rule, issued consistent with the Proclamation, restricts asylum eligibility for those who cross the southern U.S. border unlawfully or without authorization. That means that noncitizens who have crossed unlawfully or without authorization since June 5, 2024, are considered ineligible for asylum, with certain exceptions.\n\nThe limitation on asylum eligibility will be discontinued when encounters fall below certain levels but will come back into effect if encounters rise again. For additional details on the Proclamation and IFR, see the DHS fact sheet available at the following link:\n\nFact Sheet: Presidential Proclamation to Suspend and Limit Entry and Joint DHS-DOJ Interim Final Rule to Restrict Asylum During High Encounters at the Southern Border | Homeland Security\n\nIndividuals in Mexico may continue to use the CBP One\u2122 mobile app\u2019s appointment scheduling function. Currently, CBP makes 1,450 appointments available per day at eight land ports of entry via this functionality. Use of the app requires those seeking an appointment to submit vital information in advance, improving DHS\u2019s ability to conduct screening and vetting.\n\nBuilding on Significant Actions to Enforce our Laws and Expand Access to Lawful Pathways and Processes\n\nA majority of all southwest border encounters during the past three fiscal years resulted in a removal, return, or expulsion. DHS removed or returned over 740,000 individuals in the 12 months after the end of the Title 42 public health Order, more than any year since 2010. This has included more removals to countries other than Mexico than in any prior year ever.\n\nDHS removed or returned over 740,000 individuals in the 12 months after the end of the Title 42 public health Order, more than any year since 2010. This has included more removals to countries other than Mexico than in any prior year ever. DHS has significantly expanded its capacity to conduct credible fear interviews. Since May 12, 2023, DHS has conducted more than 152,000 credible fear interviews. The Proclamation and IFR follow a series of steps that the Administration has taken over the past three years as it prepared for the end of the Title 42 public health Order, and after it was lifted last year, including surging personnel, infrastructure, and technology to the border, issuing the Circumvention of Lawful Pathways Rule, and referring record numbers of noncitizens into expedited removal.\n\nFor additional information on the actions taken over the past three years, see our fact sheet at the link below:\n\nThis Administration has also carried out the largest expansion of lawful pathways and orderly processes in decades. The Presidential Proclamation and corresponding rule are already enabling DHS to quickly remove those without a lawful basis to remain, strengthening enforcement and freeing up the asylum system for those with legitimate claims.\n\nThrough the CHNV processes, nationals of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela who have a supporter and who clear background checks, may receive advanced travel authorization to travel to the United States lawfully, without going through dangerous and costly irregular migration routes. Through the end of May, more than 462,100 CHNV nationals have arrived lawfully through the process.\n\nThrough the Safe Mobility initiative, U.S. government and international non-governmental organizations are working with several countries to establish centers where individuals can find information and screening for potential access to processes, including the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, and information on other pathways and orderly processes to the United States as well as other countries, such as Canada and Spain. More than 10,000 refugees have arrived in the United States through this initiative thus far.\n\nStill, it is important to underscore that these actions cannot achieve the same results as Congressional action. DHS needs additional personnel and funding in order to quickly impose consequences on all noncitizens who cross irregularly and do not have a legal basis to remain in the United States.",

        "text": "Iran\u2019s supreme leader warns sole reformist in presidential race, while calling for \u2018maximum\u2019 turnout\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 Iran\u2019s supreme leader issued a thinly veiled warning Tuesday to the sole reformist candidate in the country\u2019s upcoming presidential election, saying anyone who believes \u201call ways to progress\u201d come from the United States shouldn\u2019t be supported.\n\nWhile often speaking in parables like many Iranian politicians, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei appeared to directly undercut the candidacy of 69-year-old heart surgeon Masoud Pezeshkian, who has aligned himself with officials from the administration of former President Hassan Rouhani. Rouhani helped reach Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, an accord Pezeshkian has fully embraced in contrast with his five hard-line opponents, who want an agreement fully on Iran\u2019s terms.\n\nKhamenei also called for \u201cmaximum\u201d turnout for Friday\u2019s vote, which analysts say could support Pezeshkian. Already, the doctor\u2019s rallies have drawn large crowds in major cities, though it remains unclear whether his candidacy alone would be enough to push an apathetic public to vote to replace the late President Ebrahim Raisi, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Khamenei who died in a helicopter crash in May.\n\n\u201cSome politicians in our country believe they must kowtow to this power or that power, and it\u2019s impossible to progress without sticking to famous countries and powers,\u201d Khamenei said in a speech marking the Shiite holiday of Eid al-Ghadir. \u201cSome think like that. Or they think that all ways to progress pass through America. No, such people can\u2019t\u201d run the country well, he said.\n\nKhamenei\u2019s comments in his hourlong speech drew repeated cries of \u201cDeath to America, death to Israel\u201d from a raucous crowd. The 85-year-old Khamenei had to urge the crowd to quiet themselves several times during his remarks.\n\nKhamenei\u2019s call comes after a parliamentary election that saw a record low turnout earlier this year. Voters across the capital, Tehran, who have spoken with The Associated Press have expressed widespread apathy over the election as Iran faces an economy crushed by Western sanctions and after widespread anti-government protests in recent years, particularly after the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini and women refusing to wear the country\u2019s mandatory headscarf, or hijab.\n\nPezeshkian, little known to the general public before registering for the campaign, has drawn large crowds in Tehran and other major cities. Among his most-prominent allies is former Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, who led negotiations for the nuclear deal.\n\nKhamenei\u2019s remarks also can be seen as a warning to Zarif and even Rouhani himself, whose former administration has been blasted by hard-liners in the time since the collapse of the deal in 2018 after then-U.S. President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the deal. Since then, Iran has advanced its program to enrich uranium up to weapons-grade levels while also hampering the ability of international inspectors to monitor it.\n\nPezeshkian also has been trying to adopt symbols of previous campaigns by popular reformists, who seek to change Iran\u2019s theocracy from inside. His campaign slogan \u201cFor Iran,\u201d a call to nationalism rather than religion, mirrors an earlier campaign slogan used by former reformist President Mohammad Khatami.\n\nPezeshkian also has been photographed wearing green scarves \u2014 apparently trying to associate himself with the 2009 Green Movement protests that swept Iran after the disputed vote and bloody crackdown that saw hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad re-elected as president.\n\nKhamenei made a point to seemingly link the upcoming election to the wider tensions in the Mideast amid the Israel-Hamas war.\n\n\u201cThe Islamic Republic has enemies. One thing that helps the Islamic Republic overcome its enemies are the elections,\u201d Khamenei said. \u201cIf a good turnout is seen in these elections, it will make the Islamic Republic proud.\u201d\n\nHowever, Friday\u2019s vote comes after a record-low turnout in Iran\u2019s March parliamentary election of just under 41%. Similar numbers could be seen in the presidential election as well.\n\nIf all the hard-line candidates stay in, they could split the vote against Pezeshkian and could force a second round of voting a week later as Iranian law requires a winner to receive more than 50% of all votes cast. Typically though, candidates drop out after the last debate and coalesce around one clear front runner.\n\n\u201cPezeshkian is leading and over the next three days he will definitely widen the gap with others,\u201d said analyst Abbas Abdi, who is aligned with reformists. \u201cWithdrawing is not going to help them.\u201d\n\nNoting how all levers of Iran\u2019s government had been held by hard-liners under Raisi without any change, Abdi added, \u201cThe ruling system has made a policy shift because it has realized that unifying the ruling system doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nKhamenei\u2019s remarks appeared timed to give his opponents ammunition for the last televised debate before the election, which happened just a short time later. Pezeshkian did not directly acknowledge the supreme leader\u2019s remarks, but stuck to his stance that talks to restore the deal remained key.\n\n\u201cWho should be blamed for these problems in the governmental offices and the inflation and prices of meat, bread and housing?\u201d Pezeshkian said, before sarcastically answering: \u201cAmerica probably made these too!\u201d\n\nHard-line candidate Amirhossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi repeatedly criticized Pezeshkian, particularly his ties to reformists. In one exchange, Ghazizadeh Hashemi sought to suggest Pezeshkian supporters could violently protest if he loses.\n\n\u201cWho started the troublemaking in the country? Who used to call people to the streets when they didn\u2019t gain power?\u201d he said. \u201cI am worried that if Dr. Pezeshkian doesn\u2019t win, his supporters, who have a notable history in this matter, will once again claim fraud and call people to the streets.\u201d\n\nPezeshkian responded by mocking Ghazizadeh Hashemi for promising in the 2021 presidential campaign that he would solve all the problems in the country\u2019s stock market in three days. The state TV feed of the debate showed Ghazizadeh Hashemi giving Pezeshkian a side-eye glance before cutting away.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always taken the side of the oppressed and never taken the side of the oppressor,\u201d Pezeshkian later said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists Amir Vahdat, Nasser Karimi and Mehdi Fattahi in Tehran, Iran, contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Impact of the 2024 U.S. Ele...\nThis blog was published as a two-part series.\n\n\n\n\n\nPart One\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s hard to turn on the news without hearing about the upcoming U.S. presidential election and the potential issues and concerns driving votes come November. Arguably top amongst those issues is immigration \u2014 which has been a sore spot for U.S. government policymakers for decades but never more so than over the past two electoral cycles.\n\n\n\nWith millions of immigrants \u2014 both documented and undocumented \u2014 entering the country each year, it\u2019s important for both immigrants and residents of the United States to grasp and understand the immigration related policy ramifications associated with the respective candidates vying for executive office in the 2024 electoral cycle.\n\n\n\nRepublicans and Democrats typically have vastly differing party views on immigration. Immigration has been a major campaign issue over the last several presidential election cycles and is likely to remain so moving forward. Which party retains or takes power in the Executive Branch will have much to do with whether the U.S. policy toward immigration shifts to prioritizing allowing more immigrants in and legalizing those there without authorization currently or keeping immigrants out of the United States and enforcing the law against those who are currently there illegally. With millions of undocumented intending immigrants crossing U.S. borders without authorization over the past several years, the fate of these intending immigrants \u2014 whether they are permitted to stay and given a path to citizenship or deported to their home countries and required to go through a legal process to enter and stay in the United States \u2014 also may lie with the incoming president.\n\n\n\n\n\nWho makes immigration law?\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Congress, made up of the House of Representatives and the Senate, is the law-making body of the U.S. federal government. Congress drafts bills and votes to pass all immigration-related proposals and changes into law. Once approved by both houses of Congress, the bill goes to the president to ratify (approve) or veto (reject). If the president ratifies the bill, it becomes law.\n\n\n\nThis seems pretty straightforward, so where\u2019s the issue?\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Congress has not been able to agree on comprehensive immigration reform measures to fix what are seen as major issues in the existing immigration system for decades. As a result, very few laws have been passed directly changing major components of our immigration system in the recent\u2014 or even somewhat distant \u2014 past. However, \u201cWe, the People\u201d continue to have quite strong opinions about who should be permitted into the United States, permitted to stay and permitted to obtain citizenship.\n\n\n\nOn the Democratic party side, proponents tend to focus on humanitarian admissions and aid, regardless of historical priorities like skills, education and close family relationships with U.S. citizens. Some Republicans argue that this does not account for the need for immigrants to have jobs to support themselves and their families and that an influx of lower-skilled labor could impact the availability of jobs to U.S. workers and their families. On the other hand, Republicans historically have sought to protect U.S. jobs and create a sustainable system to vet immigrant candidates, which seeks a balance between job creation strategies, family reunification priorities and humanitarian needs. Some Democrats argue that this leaves desperate people with no way to escape terrible life circumstances and situations and that more cultural diversity \u2014 regardless of skills or the ability to support oneself \u2014 only strengthens U.S. society. After all, the United States is, at its core, a nation of immigrants.\n\n\n\nWhile the ineffectiveness of Congress to achieve comprehensive and effective immigration reform is not likely to be impacted by the presidential election cycle because immigration remains such a huge issue to the public, whichever president is elected will likely seek to put executive actions in place to effect temporary immigration change. \u201cExecutive actions\u201d include any action taken by the president or federal agencies to interpret, implement and enforce agency authority granted by existing laws. One type of executive action is a Presidential Executive Order (EO), which is a specific directive issued by the president to federal agencies, department heads or federal employees. These orders \u2014although not voted on by the houses of Congress directly representing the people of the 50 United States \u2014 are legally binding. In this way, a president has the authority to supersede or \u201cworkaround\u201d historical interpretations of immigration laws by \u201cinterpreting\u201d laws differently, although their executive orders or actions can be revoked by the incoming president following the next presidential election cycle four years later (and often are).\n\n\n\n\n\nPart Two\n\n\n\nAs we discussed in the first article in this series, immigration seems to be on everyone\u2019s minds, as candidates campaign for U.S. votes in the November 2024 election. The person who is elected as the next president of the United States can easily impact immigration and effectuate temporary change based on their priorities.\n\n\n\nIn the current administration under President Joe Biden, we have seen sweeping immigration reforms implemented by executive action. In his first three years alone, President Biden took 535 immigration-related executive actions. These have included actions that have been welcoming to intending immigrants \u2014 such as the border policies we have seen over the past four years \u2014 and more recently, more restrictive in nature, such as the June 2024 executive order that created a rule that can temporarily turn away migrants seeking asylum after there have been seven consecutive days of over 2,500 encounters (until there have been two straight weeks of less than 1,500 border encounters). The latest news reports are speculating that the Biden administration is currently considering a proposal to protect undocumented spouses of U.S. citizens from deportation and allow them to work in the country legally.\n\n\n\nThe prevailing Republican candidate at the moment \u2014 former president Donald Trump \u2014 on the other hand, took 472 immigration-related executive actions while president, from 2017 to 2020. These included actions to construct a border wall, allocate additional resources to the U.S. Border Patrol and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and increase the construction of detention facilities and efforts to detain intending immigrants who had entered illegally or otherwise violated immigration laws. Trump has already indicated on the campaign trail that he intends to deport many of the intending immigrants who have entered the United States illegally under the Biden administration policies and practices if re-elected to the office of president for an additional four-year term.\n\n\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\n\n\nImmigrants impact the U.S. economy and culture in so many ways \u2014 both positively and negatively. Immigration laws and policies are meant to result from a balance of equities, weighing public policy and the convenience or hardship to both U.S. persons and intending immigrants to determine the fairness of granting or denying benefits. On the one hand, a massive influx of immigrants could deeply impact things like taxes, homelessness and welfare resources, as many of those who have entered over the past several years are escaping deep poverty or oppressive political systems and may have limited or no existing support system in the United States. The public concern is that there may not be enough jobs to allow these individuals to provide for themselves and/or their families \u2014 because U.S. job growth is not growing at a rate equal to the jobs needed by both U.S. persons and this new population of intending immigrants. As a result, U.S. citizens or those with legal status could end up being displaced by workers who are willing to take lower pay and less favorable working conditions in order to have jobs.\n\n\n\nOne way we might be able to combat this impact would be by increasing the amount of legal immigration permitted. Legal U.S. immigration currently prioritizes education, skills and family reunification to determine who should be permitted to come to the U.S. On the employment side, educated and skilled workers have historically been seen as more likely to contribute in a way that will create jobs and opportunities rather than simply fill a spot at a business. Likewise, immigrants who have an existing support system in place in the United States already are less likely to end up homeless or requesting benefits from the U.S. government \u2014 and thereby, the U.S. taxpayer \u2014 than those who have no support system in place. By increasing the number of nonimmigrant visas and available green cards to qualifying immigrants with jobs or close family members in the United States or who wish to invest substantial amounts of money in the United States, the country may better position itself to create more jobs and a sustainable environment for asylum seekers and their families.\n\n\n\n\n\nWill chances of coming to the United States be better in 2025?\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no guarantee that immigration will be smoother or easier for all in 2025, regardless of who is voted in. Each president and their administration has their unique priorities \u2014 and even executive actions can be questioned and end up in court if they are challenged for not supporting existing laws. Comprehensive immigration reform is unlikely to be suggested or passed until (and only if) both houses of Congress are held by a single political party \u2014 and even then, it very well could not happen, as we saw when the Democratic party held a majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate for a time under Barack Obama, and when the Republican party held a majority in both chambers for a time under Trump.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to maximize chances of obtaining status in the United States, regardless of the election?\n\n\n\nThere are dozens of legal ways to enter the United States and obtain a status that permits work and provides a potential path to citizenship \u2014 both through family members and through work opportunities. All day long, every day, immigration law practitioners such as those at our firm help foreign individuals and families who wish to come to the United States to determine their best path to permanent residence, as well as eventual citizenship if that is their ultimate goal. While immigrating to the United States permanently is not always easy and is rarely quick, there are and have always been policies and rules in place permitting and welcoming immigrants to the United States.\n\n\n\nWhile the jury is still out on whether mass amnesty will be granted to the millions of undocumented migrants who have entered the United States without authorization over the past several years, there are still dozens of ways to come to the United States under the existing rules and regulations. The best way to determine the best and surest options for long-term immigration to the United States is to contact an immigration professional whose entire business depends on successfully communicating options and supporting foreigners moving to the United States. If no option currently exists for you, immigration professionals can often suggest ways to improve your skills or abilities in order to qualify for status sooner rather than later.",

        "text": "Monthly U.S. immigration law news roundup: President Biden unveils multiple immigration-related policies\nWelcome to the Garfinkel Immigration news roundup, where every month we will summarize and provide links to the latest stories impacting U.S. immigration.\n\nBelow is the June 2024 edition of the Garfinkel Immigration news roundup:\n\nPresident Biden announces major initiatives for certain undocumented spouses of U.S. citizens, \u2018Dreamers\u2019\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced a pair of key immigration initiatives in mid-June which could have major positive impacts for applicable foreign nationals.\n\nThe first policy allows certain undocumented individuals who are married to U.S. citizens, as well as their children, to apply for legal permanent residency via \u201cParole in Place,\u201d while the second creates a pathway for \u201cDACA recipients and other Dreamers\u201d to \u201cmore quickly receive work visas.\u201d\n\n\u201c(President Biden) believes in expanding lawful pathways and keeping families together, and that immigrants who have been in the United States for decades, paying taxes and contributing to their communities, are part of the social fabric of our country,\u201d the White House wrote in a fact sheet about the new policies shortly after they were released.\n\nIt is important to note that information on these programs is currently very limited. Key details have not yet been released, including exact eligibility, application procedures, and timeline.\n\nThere are no forms or applications to file pursuant to this program at this time. It is anticipated that program implementation may not be until later this summer, or thereafter.\n\nRead the full story here and learn more about how to proactively prepare for the application process here.\n\nTips for the naturalization process\n\nGarfinkel Immigration Law Firm published its newest white paper earlier this month.\n\nIn the paper, Senior Associate Attorney Catherine Magennis provides tips for those considering beginning the naturalization process.\n\n\u201cGreen card holders who are eligible and interested in becoming a U.S. citizen should start the process as soon as possible,\u201d Magennis writes. \u201cAfter submitting the application, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) will schedule an interview with the applicant, followed by an examination and oath ceremony. This process can take several months or even up to a year, so it is important to account time for each of these steps and any government processing or scheduling delays.\u201d\n\nRead the full white paper here.\n\nGarfinkel Immigration Law Firm and Partners honored in prestigious 2024 Chambers USA guide\n\nGarfinkel Immigration Law Firm as well as Founder Steven H. Garfinkel and Managing Partner Hannah F. Little have all once again been ranked in the 2024 edition of the prestigious and highly selective Chambers USA.\n\nThe Firm received a top-level Band 1 designation in the publication\u2019s Immigration in North Carolina Legal Rankings, while Little also received individual Band 1 recognition. Garfinkel, meanwhile, was honored with the esteemed \u201cSenior Statesperson\u201d title.\n\nChambers identifies the best law firms across the world and is often considered the gold-standard of legal honors because of its comprehensive research process and stringent selection criteria. The organization conducts \u201cthousands of in-depth interviews\u201d a year with in-house counsel, clients and third-party experts.\n\nFirm and attorney rankings are based on seven factors which include technical legal ability; professional conduct; client service; commercial astuteness; diligence; commitment; and \u201cother qualities most valued\u201d by clients.\n\nFirms and attorneys who are ranked in Chambers have \u201cstood out in the most rigorous, independent and in-depth research process of any legal directory on the market and emerged as one of the best\u201d in their practice area.\n\nFind out more here.\n\nBiden rolls out asylum restrictions\n\nPresident Biden also issued an executive order earlier this month which placed \u201csignificant restrictions on migrants seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border.\u201d\n\nThe order takes effect when \u201cthe number of border encounters between ports of entry hits 2,500 per day,\u201d according to an analysis of the executive order from the Associated Press.\n\n\u201cOnce this order is in effect, migrants who arrive at the border but do not express fear of returning to their home countries will be subject to immediate removal from the United States, within a matter of days or even hours,\u201d the AP story read. \u201cThose migrants could face punishments that could include a five-year bar from reentering the U.S. or even criminal prosecution.\u201d\n\nThe story continued: \u201cMeanwhile, anyone who expresses that fear or an intention to seek asylum will be screened by a U.S. asylum officer but at a higher standard than currently used. If they pass the screening, they can pursue more limited forms of humanitarian protection, including the U.N. Convention Against Torture.\u201d\n\nThe ACLU and other immigration advocacy groups filed a lawsuit in federal court attempting to block the executive order shortly after it was released.\n\nFind out more via the Associated Press here.\n\nDHS, USCIS urged to protect green card applicants and their children\n\nA bipartisan group of senators and congress people have called on the Biden administration to \u201ctake administrative action to protect the children of green card applicants,\u201d according to an article published by Forbes earlier this month.\n\n\u201cChildren of professionals waiting in the employment-based green card backlog may need to leave the country if they turn 21 before their parents obtain permanent residence,\u201d the article read. \u201cCongress has not passed legislation providing legal status or green cards to young people who might \u2018age out\u2019 because of the per-country limit and the low annual number of employment-based immigrant visas.\u201d\n\nThe bipartisan group requested three specific policy changes, according to Forbes, which included:\n\nClarifying \u201cthe applicability of potential grants of deferred action on a case-by-case basis, where discretion is warranted, for children of long-term visa holders who age out of status.\u201d\n\nExpanding employment authorization eligibility to \u201cchild dependents of visa holders.\u201d\n\nCreating \u201ca process to allow children of long-term visa holders who have aged out to seek parole.\u201d\n\nRead the full Forbes article here.\n\nHere\u2019s what to know about the U.S. team\u2019s Cinderella run at the Cricket T20 World Cup\n\nThis story from NPR details the United States national cricket team\u2019s historic run in the T20 World Cup. The team is mostly comprised of immigrants.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. team has many players who were born overseas and have since moved to the U.S. to make their homes here,\u201d the story read. \u201cAmong the nationalities: India, Pakistan, South Africa and New Zealand. The team\u2019s coach, Stuart Law, is from Australia, and its captain, Aaron Jones, was born in Queens to immigrants from Barbados.\u201d\n\nThe team\u2019s star player, Saurabh Netravalkar, was born in India, according to NPR.\n\n\u201cIn 2015, (Netravalkar) decided to pursue software engineering and moved to the U.S. for graduate school,\u201d the story read. \u201cNow, with a full-time job, he trains during the evenings and weekends, and his employer, the tech company Oracle, allows him to take leave to pursue his cricket career, he said.\u201d\n\nRead the full NPR story here.",

He has been the country's de facto leader since 1994, when his then rebel group, the Rwanda Patriotic Front, seized power at the end of the genocide directed at members of his Tutsi ethnic group.\n\nHe won the last presidential election in 2017 with nearly 99% of the vote.\n\nThe 66-year-old president has faced criticism from rights groups for cracking down on the opposition - but he has fierecly defended Rwanda's record on human rights, saying his country respects political freedoms.\n\nAfter Sunday's stampede, the ministry of local government reminded \"those participating in campaign activities... to follow the instructions given by those in charge to ensure the safety and tranquillity of those participating in campaign activities\".\n\nOn Monday morning, Mr Kagame's RPF-Inkotanyi party said it was \"deeply saddened\" and sent its condolences to the deceased's family.\n\n\"The RPF-Inkotanyi organisation will continue to... closely monitor those injured in the crush,\" it said in a statement published on social media.\n\nEarlier, the party posted a video on Facebook of Mr Kagame taking the stage at the rally. Crowds of supporters, decked out in party colours, can be seen dancing, cheering, and waving flags. Some 250,000 people were in attendance, the party said.\n\nMr Kagame will face two other politicians - Frank Habineza of the Democratic Green Party and independent Philippe Mpayimana - in the race to become president.\n\nDiane Rwigara, an outspoken critic of Mr Kagame, was barred from standing in next month\u2019s presidential election.\n\nThe electoral commission said Ms Rwigara had failed to provide the correct documentation to show she had no criminal record and had not shown she had enough support nationwide to stand.\n\nMs Rwigara, who was also disqualified from the 2017 poll, dismissed these reasons, saying she had been \"cheated\" out of her \"right to campaign\".\n\nRwandans will head to the polls on 15 July to elect their next president and lawmakers.",

        "text": "Once a rallying cry, 'radical Islamic terrorism' fades from Trump rhetoric\nIn 2016, Donald Trump's presidential campaign echoed with a frequent vow to crush \"radical Islamic terrorism.\"\n\nFast forward to today, as he seeks a second chance in the White House, Trump rarely mentions the phrase, his erstwhile rhetoric about Islamist terrorism eclipsed by a focus on immigration, crime and other domestic issues.\n\nThe shift came into sharp relief on Sunday when a coordinated terrorist assault on a police station, churches and synagogues in southern Russia left at least 20 people dead. What might once have prompted a flurry of tweets went unmentioned on Trump's Truth Social platform.\n\nWhy the silence on what was once a rallying cry? Experts suggest two factors: diminished public concern about terrorism and a possible strategic play for the Muslim American vote.\n\nBrian Levin, an extremism expert who has closely followed Trump's rhetoric, said the former president \u2014 \"more of an opportunist than an ideologue\" \u2014 is zeroing in on issues that resonate with voters.\n\n\"Eight years ago, when the threat of foreign-inspired extremism polled among the top concerns of voters, Trump successfully invoked terror attacks \u2026 to drum up support,\" Levin said. \"Today, however, Trump has to pivot somewhat to domestic issues relating to the economy, democracy, crime and the border as well as the record of an incumbent he hopes to unseat.\"\n\nDefending his record in office, including his handling of southern border immigration, President Joe Biden has made protecting democracy a centerpiece of his campaign, casting Trump as a grave threat to the country.\n\nBut Biden's staunch support of Israel during its military campaign in Gaza has angered many Muslim voters, opening a rare opportunity for Trump, according to experts.\n\nGabriel Rubin, a justice studies professor at Montclair State University, said Trump may be eyeing the Muslim vote in key battleground states with large Muslim populations that could determine the outcome of the November election.\n\n\"He has an avenue not to mention ['radical Islamic terrorism'] too much,\" Rubin, who has written about Trump's past rhetoric about Muslims and terrorism, told VOA in an interview. \"I think he can win some of these Midwestern states if he plays his cards right.\"\n\nTo be sure, the threat of international terrorism hasn't vanished. In the months since the outbreak of conflict in Gaza, U.S. officials, including FBI Director Christopher Wray, have been sounding the alarm about an increased potential for terrorist attacks.\n\nBut while the warnings seem to have raised the public's worries about terrorism, \"overall concern about the issue still doesn't match the higher levels of concern it garnered\" in 2015 and 2016, according to an April Gallup report.\n\nTrump's 2016 campaign rhetoric \u2014 from claiming \"Muslims hate us\" to calling for a \"complete and total\" shutdown of Muslims entering the country \u2014 did not happen in a bubble.\n\nThough on the run, the Islamic State (IS) still controlled large swaths of territory in Syria and Iraq and advocated attacking the West. Adding to Americans' angst about terrorism were a spate of IS-inspired terror attacks across Europe and the United States.\n\nIn the 12 months leading up to the November election, Trump tweeted 164 times about Islamic State, \"radical Islam\" and terrorism \u2014 nearly twice as much as he did about border security and immigration, according to one estimate.\n\nTrump's vitriolic comments on Muslims and Islam, welcomed by his supporters, unnerved many in the Muslim community, drawing charges of Islamophobia against him, which he and his allies reject.\n\nVOA reached out to the Trump campaign for comment but did not receive a response. The Biden campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBiden's stance on terrorism, particularly Islamist terrorism, also has evolved over the years.\n\nWhile he is not known to have used the phrase \"radical Islamic terrorism,\" in the past he was more willing to employ similar language while taking a tough stance on terrorism.\n\nIn 2014, as vice president under President Barack Obama, he criticized Turkey and the United Arab Emirates for supporting jihadi groups in Syria and \"the extremist elements of jihadis coming from other parts to the world.\" He later apologized for the comment.\n\nSince becoming president in 2021, Biden has focused on terrorism more broadly without singling out any one region or religion, moving away from the rhetoric of the \"War on Terror\" of the 2000s.\n\nOn the day he entered the White House, he repealed the Trump administration's \"Muslim ban,\" calling it \"a stain on our national conscience.\"\n\nIn the wake of the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, moreover, his administration placed a greater emphasis on domestic terrorism as a significant threat to homeland security. In 2021, it launched the first-ever national strategy for countering domestic terrorism.\n\nAfter the October 7 Hamas attack, Biden condemned the attack as \"pure, unadulterated evil\" while putting a distance between the perpetrators and the broader Muslim community.\n\n\"You know, I know many of you in the Muslim American community or the Arab American community, the Palestinian American community, and so many others are outraged and hurting, saying to yourselves, \u2018Here we go again,\u2019 with Islamophobia and distrust we saw after 9/11,\" Biden said on October 10.\n\nTrump is not known for moderating his rhetoric, even while in office. But after his second year in the White House, the volume of his rhetoric about Muslims and terrorism fell dramatically as he shifted his focus to a new area: border security and illegal immigration.\n\nThat trend has continued into the current campaign. A VOA examination of his most recent social media posts and campaign statements found fewer than 20 references since the start of his reelection campaign, including only one mention of \"radical Islamic terrorists.\"\n\nThat came last July when he announced that he'd reinstate a travel ban on several Muslim countries that he imposed during his first term in office and which Biden later repealed.\n\n\"We don't want people coming into our country that hate us. We want people that love us,\" he told a rally, citing anti-police riots in France sparked by the killing of a French Moroccan teenager.\n\nTrump supporters dismiss his rhetoric about Muslims and terrorism as just that \u2014 rhetoric.\n\n\"Let's forget about what this guy says. Let's look at what he does,\" a Muslim Republican activist said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nAnother activist questioned whether Trump has ever said he hates Muslims, adding that more Muslims will likely vote for the former president than did in 2016.\n\nBut if there is one thing both Trump supporters and detractors agree on, it is that Trump will likely follow through on his vow to bring back the \"Muslim ban.\"\n\n\"The legal structure that allowed the Muslim ban to be implemented in the first place is still on the books so we have to start planning as if a new Muslim ban will come into existence,\" said Corey Saylor, research and advocacy director for the Council on American Islamic Relations.",

Televised presidential debates between general election candidates have always started in September or early October, going back to the first one between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon in 1960.\n\nHere\u2019s how to watch the debate:\n\nWhen and where will the debate take place?\n\nThe 90-minute debate will take place on Thursday, June 27, at 9 p.m. ET at the network\u2019s Atlanta studios.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Inside CNN's Presidential Debate: How it will work 02:15 - Source: CNN\n\nWho is moderating?\n\nCNN\u2019s Jake Tapper and Dana Bash will moderate the event.\n\nWhere and how can I watch it?\n\nThe CNN Presidential Debate will air live on CNN, CNN International and CNN en Espa\u00f1ol, and via streaming on Max for subscribers and without a cable login on CNN.com. CNN will make the debate available to simulcast on additional broadcast and cable news networks.\n\nYou can also follow CNN\u2019s live debate coverage on CNN.com, which will include analysis and fact checking.\n\nWhat were the qualifications?\n\nBiden and Trump will be the only presidential candidates participating in the debate.\n\nIn order to qualify, candidates had to satisfy the requirements outlined in Article II, Section 1 of the US Constitution to serve as president, as well as file a formal statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nAccording to parameters set by CNN in May, all participating debaters had to appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to reach the 270 electoral vote threshold to win the presidency and receive at least 15% in four separate national polls of registered or likely voters that meet CNN\u2019s standards for reporting.\n\nPolls that meet those standards are those sponsored by CNN, ABC News, CBS News, Fox News, Marquette University Law School, Monmouth University, NBC News, The New York Times/Siena College, NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist College, Quinnipiac University, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post.\n\nBiden and Trump were the only candidates to meet those requirements.\n\nThe pair has also agreed to participate in another debate hosted by ABC on September 10.\n\nWhat are the rules of the debate?\n\nThe debate will include two commercial breaks, according to the network, and campaign staff may not interact with their candidate during that time. The candidates agreed to appear at a uniform podium. Microphones will be muted throughout the debate except for the candidate whose turn it is to speak. While no props or pre-written notes will be allowed on the stage, candidates will be given a pen, a pad of paper and a bottle of water. The event will not feature a studio audience.\n\nCatch up on CNN\u2019s recent campaign coverage\n\nWhat to watch: Abortion, the economy and the Israel-Hamas war are sure to be among the most important issues discussed at Thursday night\u2019s debate.

        "text": "Polling Insight: 4 Takeaways About Suburban Women Voters\nSuburban women have long been a coveted voting bloc for both Democratic and Republican candidates. Decades ago, this group was largely described as white suburban mothers, but the demographics of suburban women voters are changing and now the group is more akin to a microcosm of the U.S. as they shift younger, and more racially and ethnically diverse \u2013 which had led to a strong Democratic advantage in the past two presidential elections. For example, Democratic candidates gained ground among suburban voters from 2016 to 2020. But in 2022, suburban voters were divided between Democratic and Republican candidates and now analysts are wondering which candidate has the advantage in 2024 among this key voting group.\n\nThe KFF Survey of Women Voters finds that suburban women still lean Democratic and nearly half say they plan on voting for President Biden in November. Yet for many, inflation is top of mind \u2013 an issue that four in ten say neither political party does a better job of addressing. On the key issue of abortion, suburban women align most closely with the Democratic Party in terms of the policies they support.\n\nThe analysis is based on a survey of more than 3,000 women nationally including 636 suburban women nationally and 275 suburban women voters in Arizona. The entire project is available on the KFF Survey of Women Voters Dashboard, which includes more data from the survey, as well as the topline and methodology.\n\n#1: Most Suburban Women Identify as Pro-Choice, Say Abortion Should Be Legal\n\nAlongside these changing demographics, suburban women hold very similar views on abortion as women nationally. While about half of suburban women voters (47%) say they are Democrats or lean Democratic (more than one-third identify as Republican or Republican-leaning and one in five are independents), more than two-thirds of suburban women voters (69%) say they identify as \u201cpro-choice\u201d (compared to 67% of women voters, nationally) and about three-fourths say they think abortion should be legal in all or most cases (compared to 74% of women, nationally). The views of suburban women on abortion more closely align with urban women rather than women living in rural areas who are more likely to identify as pro-life (40%) and want abortion to be illegal in all or most cases (36%).\n\nMost Republican Suburban Women Identify as Pro-life but Half Support Some Abortion Access, One in Four Think Republican Party Has Gone Too Far\n\nWomen voters living in the suburbs who are Republican or lean Republican are more supportive of broader abortion access than their rural counterparts, even though more than half of suburban Republican women (58%) identify as pro-life (which is similar to the share of rural Republican women who say the same). Half of Republican suburban women say they think abortion should be legal in all or most cases, and one in four (26%) say the Republican Party has done too much to restrict access to reproductive health services. This is twice the share of rural Republican women voters who say the same (13%). In addition, one in four Republican women in the suburbs are worried they or someone close to them will need an abortion during a medical emergency and be unable to get it (similar to share of urban Republican women who say the same, but half the share of Democrats who say the same, regardless of where they live). Most suburban women voters, regardless of partisanship, say they know someone (including themselves) who has ended a pregnancy by abortion (56% of suburban Republican women and 66% of suburban Democratic women). It is also important to note that one-fourth of Republican women voters in the suburbs say they prefer another Republican nominee for president other than former President Trump.\n\n#2: Suburban Women Largely Favor Policies Protecting Access to Abortion\n\nAcross all partisans, women voters living in the suburbs support laws protecting access to abortions in some instances including for patients who are experiencing pregnancy-related emergencies, or in cases of rape or incest in all states where abortion is banned. Large majorities of Democratic women in the suburbs (91%) and independent women in the suburbs (80%) support a law guaranteeing a nationwide right to abortion, as do nearly half of suburban Republican women (46%). Majorities of Republican women voters in the suburbs also support leaving it up to the states to decide whether abortion is legal (62%) as well as a law establishing a 15-week abortion ban nationwide (60%).\n\nConsistent with what the national KFF Survey of Women Voters shows in other states with abortion-related ballot measures, majorities of suburban women support ballot measures enshrining abortion access. In Arizona, a battleground state in which voters will likely be voting on an abortion-related ballot initiative, a large majority of suburban women as well majorities of urban and rural women say they plan on voting in support of this initiative. Half (49%) of suburban women voters in Arizona say that if this initiative appears on the ballot in their state, they will be more motivated to vote, while half (48%) say it will not impact their decision to vote.\n\n#3: Suburban Women Say Inflation Is Top Voting Issue, Say Neither Party Does Better at Handling Rising Costs\n\nPart of President Biden\u2019s appeal to suburban women has been on the issue of abortion and the overturning of Roe v. Wade, yet inflation is the top voting issue for more than a third (36%) of suburban women voters followed by threats to democracy (25%). Abortion ranks third, alongside immigration, with both cited as the most important voting issue by 12% of suburban women voters.\n\nSimilar shares of urban, suburban, and rural women say abortion is their most important voting issue (10%, 12%, and 7%, respectively); and while inflation is the top issue across geographic areas, the issue is most important for a larger share of rural voters (46%) than suburban voters (36%). Suburban women are more likely to cite threats to democracy as the most important voting issue than their rural counterparts (25% compared to 17%).\n\nWith inflation top of mind for suburban women, it is striking that neither party has the advantage among this group on the key issue of addressing the cost of household expenses. Four in ten suburban women (41%) say neither party does a better job of addressing the cost of household expenses, even as suburban women give the Democratic Party the advantage on all other issues asked about including cost of health care and childcare.\n\nAbout three-fourths of suburban women voters report worrying about affording the cost of health care for them and their family (73%), or their food or groceries (72%). In addition, nearly two-thirds say they worry about being able to afford their monthly utilities (63%), and more than half of suburban women (56%) worry a lot or some about being able to afford their rent or mortgage (similar to the share of rural women who say the same).\n\n#4: Suburban Women Feel Frustrated About Upcoming Presidential Election, Largely Dissatisfied with Candidates\n\nWith suburban women citing many issues as important to their vote, it is notable that 12% say they don\u2019t plan on voting in the upcoming presidential election or that they will vote for a third-party candidate. This includes similar shares of Democratic suburban women (8%) and Republican suburban women (9%) and three in ten independent suburban women. This may reflect their overall feelings toward the two frontrunner party candidates. Three-fourths of suburban women voters say they feel frustrated about the upcoming presidential election including 76% of Democratic suburban women, 74% of Republican suburban women, and 72% of independent suburban women.\n\nIn addition, six in ten are not satisfied with their choices for president, including a third who say they are \u201cnot at all satisfied.\u201d When asked why they are not satisfied with their choices for president, suburban women offered a multitude of responses related to the candidates\u2019 age, temperament, and their stances on key issues.\n\nWhat is the main reason why you aren\u2019t satisfied with Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee for president? \u201cWe need a young fresh perspective on fixing America\u2019s issues. These old white men do not represent our diverse nation.\u201d \u2013 52 year old Democratic multi-racial woman from suburban Nevada \u201cHe supports Israel and is funding the terroristic side of the war.\u201d \u2013 18 year old Democratic Hispanic woman from suburban Georgia \u201cI would like him to be stronger on liberal issues\u201d \u2013 36 year old Democratic White woman from suburban Maryland What is the main reason why you aren\u2019t satisfied with Donald Trump as the Republican nominee for president? \u201cHe lacks leadership and encourages divisiveness within our country\u201d \u2013 60 year old Republican White woman from suburban Florida \u201cThe economy, the wars abroad, climate change, and women\u2019s rights regarding abortion.\u201d \u2013 57 year old Republican White woman from suburban Pennsylvania \u201cI am concerned he will be impeached or not be able to run if he\u2019s convicted of felonies\u201d \u2013 41 year old Republican White woman from suburban North Carolina\n\nAll signs point to an exceptionally tight presidential election where even slight advantages could tip the electoral balance in favor of either candidate. Suburban women are not voting as a monolith and have competing priorities driving their voting decisions this fall, including whether they decide to turn out or stay home. While various factors influence voters, the candidates\u2019 stances on abortion and their handling of inflation could serve as crucial benchmarks for many suburban women when casting their ballots.",

Various national surveys have indicated a neck-to-neck competition between the Democrats and the Republicans. Former US President Donald Trump is presently ahead of his opponent Joe Biden . A report in the \u2018Intelligencer\u2019 has now revealed that the incumbent President Biden is consulting his former boss, Barack Obama and the two are working out strategies to ensure that Biden returns to the Whitehouse for a second term. Biden had met his former boss in December for lunch at the Whitehouse where the two democrats had discussed various political and policy related issues.It has been reported that Obama had not favored Biden earlier in 2019 and was supporting other candidates in the presidential race. His support to his former Vice-President began after the party announced him as the official presidential nominee. Obama became actively involved in shoring up support for Biden by convincing Senator Bernie Sanders and others to support him. He regularly spoke to Biden and his advisors who were running the campaign of Biden and offered his advice when sought. Further, both Biden and Obama have not seen eye to eye on some policy related decisions. The former US president has also stayed away from politics, but has kept himself regularly informed of the events.Obama has also met many social media influencers in recent times and has sought their support for Biden. He has also helped the democrats with short clips which will be show cased during the campaign.In 2011, Obama had decided to re-assign some of his advisors to run the political campaign. He retained some of his advisors in Washington and sent the others to Chicago to get the political campaign up and running. He has advised Biden to do the same. Accordingly, Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon has moved to Wilmington to manage Biden\u2019s political campaign. The former president has also advised Biden on various policy related matters. Trump and Biden will face each other in a debate on Thursday at Atlanta.Obama has acknowledged that the upcoming election will be a tough campaign for Biden who faces anti-incumbency and will be up against Trump who has a slight lead over Biden in the surveys. Further, Obama lashed out at Trump and pointed out that he has recently been convicted in the hush money case and his firm has been accused of evading taxes.The two democrats were seen recently at Los Angeles in a star-studded event in which the democrats received more than $30 million in funding. This event was also attended by many Hollywood celebrities.The first debate will be hosted by CNN on August 27. The second debate will be held on September 10.",

        "text": "Influencers and popular podcasts fuel election disinformation among Black voters, report shows\nAt least 40 million Americans may be regularly targeted and fed disinformation within Black online spaces by a host of sources across social media, fueling false information around the election, according to a new report published Tuesday.\n\nTouted as the first deep dive into understanding disinformation targeting Black America, the report, published by Onyx Impact, a nonprofit organization working to combat disinformation within the Black community, identified half a dozen core online networks \u201creaching or targeting\u201d Black Americans online with false and misleading narratives.\n\nConservative commentators like Candace Owens are among the most influential distributors of false information, according to the report, followed by a variety of sources, such as platforms geared toward the Black manosphere, like the \u201cFresh and Fit\u201d podcast. Some episodes of the show have outright challenged women\u2019s intelligence and allowed guests to share false and harmful narratives without pushback.\n\nThe report identifies some platforms like the nationally syndicated radio show, \u201cThe Breakfast Club,\u201d as a \"gateway influencer\u201d or an authentic online space that holds critical space for stemming the tide of disinformation. These platforms, however, are also often targets for \u201cbad actors to introduce harmful narratives,\u201d according to the report.\n\nThree other effective sources of disinformation, the report notes, are extreme Black nativists and separatists, like Foundational Black Americans who don\u2019t believe in the concept of pan-Africanism and have stressed that people who are not descendants of enslaved people should not speak for or on behalf of Black Americans, as well as health skeptics such as Rizza Islam, an activist and self-proclaimed intellectual extremist, who has said without evidence that childhood vaccines \u201cdestroy the brain chemistry\u201d and lead to autism and other disabilities. According to the CDC, this is not true. None of the other individuals or platforms listed above responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe report also identified foreign actors \u201cthat seek to influence U.S. political discourse,\u201d like the digital media company African Stream.\n\nAfrican Stream denied spreading misinformation, adding that they \u201cpresent an authentically African perspective.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a vigorous fact-checking process, which means work is checked by three different trained journalists three times before posting on our platforms,\u201d the Nairobi-based company said in a statement, describing their work as a \u201cPan-African digital media platform covering affairs concerning Africans at home and in the diaspora.\u201d\n\nOnyx Impact found those six sources collectively have a potential reach of nearly 41 million Americans, adding that each represents spaces where skepticism, anti-Black rhetoric and deception of truth run rampant. For context, that figure is equivalent to nearly every Black person in the country, according to the latest census data.\n\nOver four months, a team of researchers for Onyx Impact identified 2,500 online accounts creating, sharing or amplifying disinformation to Black communities. The researchers also held seven national focus groups of Black audiences to understand how those narratives were showing up in offline spaces. The point of the effort was to gauge the impact of the information, said the founder of Onyx Impact, Esosa Osa, an alumnus of the voting rights group Fair Fight.\n\nCandace Owens on the set of \"Candace\" in 2022. Jason Davis / Getty Images file\n\nConstant repetition of false or misleading information, \u201cno matter how kind of absurd that disinformation is,\u201d said Osa, can be effective across audiences, regardless of income, education or class. \u201cDisinformation works because the more times that we hear something, the more likely we are to believe that it is true,\u201d she said.\n\nNarratives with the highest reach and impact across the networks, the report says, include misleading narratives focused on promises that these networks say President Joe Biden has broken, civic engagement and issues that stoke division.\n\nEarlier this year, for example, Owens tweeted without evidence that vaccines cause an \u201cexplosion\u201d of childhood cancer. But experts, through data, have denied that any link exists. In another instance, Owens shared inaccurate information that the shooter that killed 21 people, including 19 children, at Robb Elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, in 2022 was transgender, an assertion that was based on the wrong photos of the shooter.\n\nCritics have also repeatedly slammed the popular gossip site The Shade Room for being a hub for disinformation, particularly on issues related to Biden. The outlet once reported about a Biden-backed program to distribute \u201ccrack pipes\u201d to promote health equity. The site ran with an article by The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website. The post quickly went viral, and the White House called it \u201cmisleading and misinformed.\u201d In reality, the program was harm-reduction program meant to reduce drug overdoses. The Shade Room corrected the information in a follow-up post and took the original post down, but for many, the misinformation had already spread further than the truth.\n\nThe Shade Room did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe report noted that \u201cconfronting the challenges created by misinformation\u201d is \u201ccrucial to ensuring the health and stability of our democracy.\u201d\n\nWhen it is left unchecked, experts said, disinformation can have devastating effects on the most marginalized communities, including harming physical and mental health.\n\nTimothy Welbeck, a civil rights attorney and director of the Center for Anti-Racism at Temple University, said disinformation presented as fact has the \u201cheightened ability\u201d to influence Black communities\u2019 decision-making in ways never before seen, particularly less than five months from a presidential election.\n\n\u201cIt can either encourage [voter] apathy or potentially encourage people to vote differently than they would have already,\u201d Welbeck said, noting that Americans\u2019 biggest issues, from the economy to Israel\u2019s war with Hamas to federal judicial appointments, will greatly be affected by who becomes president in November \u2014 in his eyes, a direct byproduct of how successful disinformation continues to spread.\n\nOnyx Impact offered strategic guidance in the report to those combating disinformation to engage with those platforms by identifying trusted messengers and discrediting bad actors. While there is no evidence that African Americans are more susceptible to disinformation than any other ethnic group, Osa said, consistent targeting of any group has a way of breaking through.\n\n\u201cBlack voters are likely less susceptible to many disinformation narratives given their deserved higher levels of skepticism in institutions and government overall,\u201d she said, \u201cbut just like other communities, when disinformation is targeted and comes from messengers with standing, it can be incredibly effective and dangerous.\u201d\n\nPolling shows that disinformation remains a concern for most Americans.\n\nA national survey published this month by the media reform group Free Press found that 79% of adults in the U.S. worry that what they read online includes \u201cfake\u201d or \u201cfalse\u201d information with the deliberate goal to \u201cconfuse.\u201d The poll of 3,000 people across the U.S. also found that 76% of respondents are concerned that they were reading misleading information online about the presidential election. Black Americans, in particular, are also disproportionately more likely to get their news from social media, the Free Press survey found.\n\nOsa said there is nothing new about increased disinformation and misinformation ahead of recent presidential elections. In 2016, Russia set out to interfere with the election by spreading propaganda on social media, hacking into campaigns and probing state voter databases, according to a Senate report. In 2020, there were coordinated efforts to deter Black voters from going to the polls more systematically, including conservative activists\u2019 making more than a thousand fake robocalls to deter Detroit voters, who are overwhelmingly Black, from voting by mail.\n\nToday, however, Osa said, the way disinformation is presented to a population with outsize political power and influence continues to be more sophisticated. Black Americans are projected to account for 14% of eligible voters in November and have a higher turnout rate than Latino voters, despite making up a lower share of the U.S. population.\n\nRecent outreach to Black voters by Biden and former President Donald Trump is evidence of an emphasis on capturing the demographic.\n\nThe latest NBC News poll found that 2 in 3 Black voters ages 18 to 49 support Biden, as well as 88% of older Black voters.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has garnered support from 1 in 4 young Black voters ahead of this year\u2019s election and 6% of older Black voters, according to the NBC News poll, in an election in which even minor changes in voting patterns in battleground states could decide the race.\n\nA vendor sells Trump merchandise outside a rally for former President Donald Trump in Laconia, N.H, on Jan. 22, the eve of the New Hampshire primary. Matt Nighswander / NBC News\n\nBy comparison, in 2020, no less than 78% of Black voters chose Biden, according to exit polling data.\n\nBut not all experts believe disinformation efforts have substantial influence now or will have it in the future.\n\nDeen Freelon, a presidential professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania and an expert in digital politics, remains hesitant about overstating how deep misinformation runs within the Black community.\n\n\u201cIt is incredibly difficult to draw a straight line between any kind of communication \u2026 and the kinds of attitudinal and behavioral changes that people would like communication to have,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just very hard to change people\u2019s minds and their behavior in substantial ways from what they\u2019re already doing.\u201d\n\nHowever, Freelon acknowledged that even a slight change in behavior could tip the race to Biden or Trump.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of people who consume [disinformation] is a small group of people, but in a close election, a small group of people can be sufficient to, at least potentially, sway the election one way or the other,\u201d he said.\n\nCORRECTION (June 26, 2024, 12:17 a.m. ET): An earlier version of this article misclassified The Breakfast Club, according to the report's criteria. The report classifies it as a \u201cgateway influencer,\u201d not as an outright distributor of false information.\n\nFor more from NBC BLK, sign up for our weekly newsletter.",

Be less bombastic, she told him, and speak more directly about the economy. But more important, she made clear to Mr. Trump and his top aides, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, be patient.\n\nShe would not donate to him while Nikki Haley, his last rival standing and a friend of hers, remained in the race, according to two people briefed on the meeting who insisted on anonymity to describe a private gathering.",

        "text": "What will the presidential election mean for corporate taxes?\nThe outcome of the 2024 presidential election will trigger a \"colossal multi-trillion-dollar fight over taxes,\" said Semafor . Big chunks of Donald Trump's 2017 tax cut law will expire in 2025, giving whoever wins the election \u2014 both the White House and Congress \u2014 \"the opportunity to rewrite much of the IRS code.\" Trump hasn't officially released a tax plan, though he recently told a gathering of CEOs that he plans new cuts to corporate taxes , while President Joe Biden has offered proposals \"aimed at raising taxes on multinational corporations and the richest Americans.\"\n\nIt's not clear that Trump has the rest of the GOP on board to slash taxes for big business. \"Anti-corporate sentiment is running high among increasingly populist-minded Republicans,\" said Politico . One influential Republican, Rep. Chip Roy (Texas), has even proposed raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 25%. \"There's a bubbling-up concern that we should not be doing the bidding of corporate America,\" Roy said. Corporate lobbyists are already rushing into the fray, with one executive saying that businesses shouldn't bear the brunt of tax increases \"because those businesses are the ones that are creating jobs.\"\n\n\"The time is now to curb the corrosive concentrations of extreme wealth and corporate power,\" Oxfam's Irit Tamir said at Fortune. While the official corporate tax rate is at 21%, the \"effective\" tax rate \u2014 what corporations actually pay after deductions \u2014 can be much lower: The pharmaceutical industry, for example, pays an effective tax rate of 11.6%. \"This is far lower than what the average American pays.\" Any new tax structure that preserves low rates for corporations and the rich is \"one that will further inequality in this country.\"\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Look in the mirror,\" Phil Gramm and Mike Solon said at The Wall Street Journal. The economics are simple: \"When the corporate tax rate increases, corporations try to pass the cost on to consumers.\" One recent Treasury study even revealed that Americans pay more in corporate taxes than in individual taxes. This is why Congress should reject efforts to raise corporate taxes. \"By taxing corporations, the Democrats are taxing the American people.\"\n\nWhat next?\n\nLike in 2020, Biden is running this year on a promise to make the wealthy and corporations pay their \"fair share,\" said The New York Times. But so far in his first term he has actually cut taxes overall, for both businesses and individuals, to the tune of roughly $600 billion over four years. \"It's reasonable to conclude from those numbers that the Biden tax policy hasn't been some kind of radical tax-raising program,\" said an expert at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. But that's in large part because Congress hasn't gone along with Biden's \"most ambitious tax-raising plans\" \u2014 and also because he has used corporate tax breaks to encourage the growth of industries like semiconductor and electric vehicle manufacturing.\n\nDespite his promise of corporate tax cuts, Axios said, Trump may be having trouble getting traction with the CEOs of America's biggest companies. No leader of a Fortune 100 company has donated to the former president's campaign. Forty-two CEOs supported George W. Bush's last campaign in 2004. \"Roughly two-thirds of CEOs are registered Republicans,\" said Axios, \"but they're not MAGA.\"",

        "text": "RFK Jr's presidential bid is shaking up an unpopular rematch \u2014 but will he ultimately help Joe Biden or Donald Trump?\nHe's an environmentalist and conspiracy theorist, an anti-establishment figure from one of America's most storied political families, a virile 70-year-old with a host of health issues.\n\nIt can be hard to get a handle on Robert F Kennedy Jr, the nephew of former president John F Kennedy, but one thing's for sure: his bid for the White House can't be easily dismissed.\n\nThe independent candidate has fallen short of qualifying for this week's presidential debate, but his polling numbers \u2014 up to around 15 per cent \u2014 suggest his candidacy could be a deciding factor in who takes the Oval Office in 2024.\n\nThat's because the winner of the expected Biden\u2013Trump rematch could be determined by a relatively small number of votes in a handful of swing states. If RFK Jr siphons significantly more support from one of the main candidates than the other, it could make all the difference.\n\nA famous name doesn't get you on the ballot\n\nAs America endures the year's first heatwave, Colin McEvers is sweating in his shirt and tie in downtown Annapolis, Maryland, trying to recruit passers-by to support RFK Jr's presidential bid.\n\nColin McEvers says he's collected thousands of signatures in Maryland to get RFK Jr on the ballot. (ABC News: Bradley McLennan)\n\n\"Hi guys, how are you doing today?\" the towering teenager says, as all 6 foot, 10 inches of him strides towards a couple in their early 40s.\n\n\"Sorry to bother you. My name's Colin.\n\n\"I'm working for the RFK Jr campaign. We're just trying to get some signatures to get an independent on the ballot for Maryland... as another option besides Biden and Trump, basically.\"\n\nThird-party candidates are not guaranteed to get their names on ballots in US elections. The requirements vary from state to state. Here in Maryland, RFK Jr needs 10,000 verified names on a petition.\n\nMcEvers, the state campaign co-ordinator, says he's personally collected more than 3,000.\n\nRFK Jr needs 10,000 verified signatures to get on the ballot in Maryland. (ABC News: Bradley McLennan)\n\nWith polls showing a majority of voters have unfavourable views of both Joe Biden and Donald Trump, the case for a third option is hitting home.\n\n\"Trump and Biden are both often off the rails,\" says Karl Klinghard, who's visiting from Tennessee and says he'll \"probably\" vote for RFK Jr in this November's election.\n\n\"I think RFK couldn't do any harm,\" he says.\n\n\"I like his environmental aspect, and I think he's got a lot to offer, you know just from his background and private industry and all those things.\"\n\nRanard Hall signed the petition in Annapolis because he's always liked the Kennedys. (ABC News: Bradley McLennan )\n\nRanard Hall doesn't really know what any of RFK Jr's policies are, but he signs the petition anyway because of the Kennedy connection.\n\n\"I was kind of young when John Kennedy got shot, but I always liked [the Kennedys],\" he says.\n\n\"I thought it was like a dominant family.\n\n\"So, you know, what I'm saying is his grandson or whoever he is, I am going to vote for him.\"\n\nA life marked by tragedy and conspiracy\n\nRFK Jr was nine years old when his uncle, then-president John F Kennedy, was assassinated in 1963.\n\nFive years later, Robert F Kennedy \u2014 JFK's brother and the current candidate's father \u2014 was also shot dead while he was seeking the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nRFK Jr, one of the late Bobby Kennedy's 11 children, has long espoused the view that the death of his uncle was orchestrated by the CIA.\n\nRobert F Kennedy, pictured with his wife Ethel and 10 of their children in about 1967. Their 11th child was born after RFK's assassination in 1968. (Getty Images)\n\nHe's also called for a new investigation into the murder of his father, arguing the evidence suggests the man serving a life sentence for the killing, Sirhan Sirhan, did not fire the fatal shots.\n\nPerhaps these experiences helped shape RFK Jr's deep distrust of government, institutions and the media, a worldview that has seen him embrace vaccine conspiracy theories.\n\nHe's been a vocal advocate of the now-debunked theory that vaccines in children are linked to autism. During the pandemic, he suggested COVID may have been engineered to target certain ethnic groups, and appeared to back a theory that Bill Gates was using the vaccine to control people via microchip.\n\n\"What was yesterday's conspiracy theory is today's truth,\" says Josh Mazer, Maryland Team Kennedy campaign co-ordinator.\n\n\"He's simply the most intelligent person in any room I've ever walked into.\"\n\nIn recent campaign appearances, RFK Jr has appeared to tone down his vaccine rhetoric, but still rails against COVID public health measures. He described them as \"the greatest restriction on individual liberties this country has ever known\" during a recent speech at the Libertarian Party convention in Washington DC.\n\nRFK Jr spoke at the Libertarian National Convention in Washington DC in June. (ABC News: Cameron Schwarz)\n\nThe speech also touched on one of RFK Jr's core policy proposals: slashing military funding and getting out of foreign wars.\n\n\"We have forfeited our moral authority because we have supported dictators and corrupt regimes and subverted democracy around the globe,\" he told the crowd.\n\nSome of the biggest cheers came when he said that, on his first day in office, he would drop all charges against Julian Assange and pardon Edward Snowden.\n\n\"Free Assange, free Assange,\" audience members chanted.\n\nAs news broke on Monday, local time, that Mr Assange had reached a plea deal with US authorities, RFK Jr suggested that a monument be built to the Australian to educate the American public about the importance of free speech.\n\nDescribing Mr Assange as a \u201cgenerational hero\u201d, RFK Jr lamented the terms of the deal, which he said meant the US had succeeded in criminalising journalism.\n\nWhile the Libertarians didn't vote him in as their 2024 candidate, he had plenty of fans in the room.\n\n\"I like the fact that he's not a politician,\" said Nancy Lou Little, a veterinarian who shares his scepticism about vaccines, America's health regulation bodies and big pharma.\n\n\"When I first heard him interviewed, I started crying because he was talking about our health problems. And I've been waiting 35 years for somebody to talk about those.\"\n\nAsked what she likes about RFK Jr, Nancy Lou Little gushes, \"Oh my gosh, almost everything\". ( ABC News: Cameron Schwarz)\n\nSpoiler alert for Biden and Trump\n\nRFK Jr began his bid as a Democratic candidate, challenging Joe Biden for the nomination.\n\nLast October, he announced he was running as an independent.\n\nHis \"America First\" tendencies and distrust of big government potentially appeals to Republican voters.\n\nYet his credentials as an environmental lawyer who helped clean up the Hudson River in New York, and his rejection of a ban on TikTok, could see win him support from younger, more left-leaning voters.\n\nThat's the thing with RFK Jr \u2014 you can really choose your own adventure.\n\nRFK Jr's politics are difficult to neatly pigeonhole. (ABC News: Cameron Schwarz)\n\n\"I'm not sure anyone knows where he stands because he is all over the place ideologically,\" says Bernard Tamas, a professor of political science at Valdosta State University in Georgia.\n\n\"A big part of his appeal is the fact that Americans are very disenchanted with the political system right now and with both candidates.\"\n\nColin McEvers, the campaigner in Maryland, likes what he sees of the candidate's plans to make first home loans more affordable by guaranteeing government-backed mortgage interest rates.\n\n\"I want to own a home in the future, I want to build a family, and it's very hard for people of my age range to do that.\"\n\nAfter unflattering video of Biden went viral, the White House fought back Photo shows Joe Biden speaks into a microphone, which he holds in one hand. He is holding up the other hand. If you're on social media, you might have come across a couple of recent viral videos this week, neither of which casts the US president in a flattering light.\n\nThe famous last name and clever use of social media \u2014 not to mention his wealthy running mate, Silicon Valley entrepreneur and philanthropist Nicole Shanahan \u2014are all helping RFK Jr outpoll the other third-party candidates.\n\nRecent polling also suggests his campaign is attracting young people and Latinos in particular, and that's a worry for Democrats who have traditionally done well with those voter groups.\n\nBut Dr Tamas says third-party candidates have historically seen their support wane as election day nears.\n\n\"Most people return to want to vote for one of the two major party candidates,\" he says.\n\n\"You're not likely to see progressive voters sticking, or large percentages of them sticking, with third-party candidates when they're afraid of Donald Trump going back into the White House.\"\n\nWhile Republicans initially seemed less worried about RFK Jr's potential, their position has started to sharpen.\n\nIn a recent social media post, Donald Trump referred to him simply as \"Junior\" and suggested he was a \"Democrat plant\".\n\nDr Tamas says he's starting to see signs RFK Jr could be more of a threat to Trump than Biden.\n\n\"The fear, I think, is that he is going to take votes from what we call the 'Never Trumpers', the moderates that don't like Biden but don't like Trump either.\"\n\nFamily rifts play out on social media\n\nJack Schlossberg was a vocal opponent of his cousin's candidacy from the outset.\n\n\"He's trading in on Camelot, celebrity, conspiracy theories and conflict for personal gain and fame... his candidacy is an embarrassment,\" JFK's grandson said in a video posted last year.\n\nMore recently, the posts by the 31-year-old son of Australia's US Ambassador Caroline Kennedy have taken on a more colourful twist.\n\nIn a series of videos, Schlossberg adopted various fake personas \u2014 including a southerner named Wade, a Russian named Vlad and a New Yorker named Joshua \u2014 to describe RFK Jr as a liar who was pumped full of testosterone and who was playing into Russia's hands.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nOther prominent members of the Kennedy clan have also come out against RFK Jr, describing his candidacy as perilous and saddening.\n\nThe family, as close to Democratic royalty as it gets, was not happy that a campaign ad played at the Superbowl traded on their name.\n\nThe Kennedys' connection to the current Democratic president is also founded in their shared Irish Catholic roots.\n\nFamily members posed at the White House with the president on St Patrick's Day and more than a dozen of them, including five of RFK Jr's siblings, endorsed Biden at a campaign event the following month.\n\nSo what's this about a brain worm?\n\nAt 70, RFK Jr is a relatively young man compared to Biden, 81, and Trump, 78.\n\nHe makes a virtue of his physical prowess.\n\nInternet users briefly lost their minds over videos of him working out shirtless.\n\nFox News swooned about his \"sheer masculinity\", CNN said there was \"nothing junior about RFK Jr's pecs\".\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nBut RFK Jr also has some significant health challenges.\n\nHis voice is gravelly and strained \u2014 a result, he says, of a neurological condition known as spasmodic dysphonia.\n\n\"I think it makes it problematical for people to listen to me,\" he told News Nation.\n\n\"I cannot listen to myself on TV, I will never listen to this broadcast.\"\n\nAnd then there's the worm.\n\nNew York Times reporting revealed that RFK Jr claims to have suffered cognitive issues starting around 2010, including memory loss and brain fog, due to a parasite in his brain.\n\nDuring his divorce proceedings, he said that a doctor had told him his problems could be \"caused by a worm that got into my brain and ate a portion of it and then died\".\n\nShortly after the reports surfaced, RFK Jr leaned in, joking about eating more brain worms.\n\nHe hasn't produced medical records on said parasite, but his campaign says he has now recovered.\n\nHis connection with the natural world goes far beyond worms.\n\nHe has several dogs and is a bird enthusiast who once kept an emu. And he recently introduced his followers to the two ravens who \"join him\" for meditations on his balcony every day, and who he says he's \"taming\".\n\nIt might seem out there, but perhaps the kind of voter attracted to RFK Jr sees it as part and parcel of his unconventional appeal.\n\nThere's certainly no sign that news of the ravens or the brain worm have damaged his run.\n\nWhile he didn't make it into the first presidential debate, under rules based on ballot access and poll numbers, it's possible he could qualify for the second one.\n\nThat kind of airtime is something neither the Biden or Trump campaign is likely to welcome in a contest predicted to come down to the wire.\n\n\"I think both candidates, both campaigns should be concerned about RFK,\" says Dr Tamas.\n\n\"Because this election is going to be extremely, extremely close.\"",

A cyber attack on CDK Global, a software provider that helps dealerships manage sales and service, has crippled the workflow at approximately 15,000 dealerships across the United States and Canada. Scott Olson | Getty Images\n\nDETROIT \u2014 U.S. auto sales through the first half of the year are expected to be up by 2.9% compared to a year ago, but there are concerns that the auto industry may not be able to continue that momentum through year-end. Vehicle inventory levels are growing, incentives are increasing and there's growing uncertainty surrounding the economy, interest rates and U.S. presidential election, according to Cox Automotive. The auto data and research firm expects sales growth to slow in the next six months to 15.7 million units, roughly a 1.3% increase from 2023. And, unlike in recent years, growth is coming from commercial sales rather than more profitable consumer sales. \"Overall, we're expecting some weakness in the coming few months,\" said Cox chief economist Jonathan Smoke during a midyear review briefing Tuesday. \"We basically are making some assumptions that we can't quite hold the pace that we've been seeing. But we're not expecting a collapse either.\"\n\nGood for consumers\n\nSuch circumstances are largely good for consumers, some of whom have been waiting years to purchase a new vehicle amid unprecedented supplies of new vehicles and record prices during the coronavirus pandemic. But those circumstances are a headwind for automakers, many of which posted record profits due to the high demand and low availability of new vehicles during the global health crisis. Wall Street has been predicting challenges in vehicle pricing and profit for most automakers compared to the record or near-record levels of recent years.\n\nBrand-new Tesla cars sit parked at a Tesla dealership on May 31, 2024, in Corte Madera, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty Images\n\n\"There's a lot of uncertainty that lies ahead, and it may make recent sales successes hard to build upon,\" Charlie Chesbrough, Cox's senior economist, said during the briefing. \"We are concerned that the second half of the year cannot maintain the growth we've seen so far.\" Rental, commercial and leasing are showing signs of double-digit growth, while Cox expects retail share of the overall industry to be down nine percentage points from 2021 to roughly 79%.\n\nWinners and losers",

        "text": "Message for U.S. Citizens: How to Vote from Abroad\nCELEBRATE DEMOCRACY THIS 4TH OF JULY BY ENSURING YOU ARE PREPARED TO VOTE IN THE 2024 U.S. ELECTION\n\nTo vote in the November 2024 election, U.S. citizens overseas need to have completed a Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) in 2024. Whether you are a first-time voter or have already received ballots and voted absentee in past elections, you must complete an FPCA each calendar year to ensure you can participate in elections as an overseas absentee voter.\n\nIf your state requires you to return paper ballots to local election officials by mail, you can do so through international mail, professional courier service, or through U.S. Embassy Warsaw\u2019s or Consulate General Krakow\u2019s diplomatic pouch. The diplomatic pouch provides free mail service from diplomatic posts; however, this form of mailing can be slow, so you should bring your ballot to us as soon as possible after receiving it. Place your ballots in postage paid return envelopes or in envelopes bearing sufficient U.S. postage in order for them to be delivered to the proper local election authorities.\n\nFor voters who only want to drop off completed, sealed FPCAs or ballots, you can drop them in the ballot box at U.S. Embassy Warsaw located to the left of the Al. Ujazdowskie 29/31 entrance to the Embassy or at U.S. Consulate General Krakow at the main entrance. It is recommended to submit your ballot as soon as you receive it or at least 30 days before the election if sent via diplomatic pouch.\n\nFor those with voting questions or in need of forms, you can visit the American Citizens Services unit at U.S. Embassy Warsaw or U.S. Consulate General Krakow on any business day, Monday through Friday, between 2:00 p.m. and 4:30 p.m. You may also obtain forms at the Consular Agency in Poznan on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays from 12:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. Please note that all visitors to the Embassy or Consulate General are subject to security screening, and you will not be permitted to bring electronic devices, including cell phones, inside the facility.\n\nEven if you have never voted while overseas before, the process is easy.\n\nRequest your ballot. Complete a new Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) . You must complete a new FPCA after January 1, 2024, to ensure you receive your ballot for the 2024 elections. Submitting the FPCA allows you to request absentee ballots for all elections for federal offices (President, U.S. Senate, and U.S. House of Representatives) including primaries and special elections during the calendar year in which it is submitted. All local election officials in all U.S. states and territories accept the FPCA. You can complete the FPCA online at FVAP.gov. The online voting assistant will ask you questions specific to your state. We encourage you to request your blank ballots be delivered electronically (by email, internet download, or fax, depending on your state). Include your email address on your FPCA to take advantage of the electronic ballot delivery option. Return the FPCA per the instructions on the website. The online voting assistant will tell you if your state allows the FPCA to be returned electronically or if you must submit a paper copy with original ink signature. If you must return a paper version, please follow the same instructions below for returning your ballot.\n\nReceive and complete your ballot. States are required to send out ballots 45 days before a regular election for federal office and generally send ballots at least 30 days before primary elections. For most states, you can confirm your registration and ballot delivery online .\n\nReturn your completed ballot . While some states allow you to return your completed ballot electronically, others do not. If your state requires you to return paper voting forms or ballots to local election officials, you can do so free of charge at the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate. Place your ballot in a postage-paid return envelope, or in an envelope bearing sufficient domestic U.S. postage, and address it to the relevant local election officials.\n\n\n\nResearch candidates and issues. Please see the FVAP links page for resources you can use to research candidates and issues. FVAP regularly sends information about election dates and deadlines through their Voting Alerts. Email vote@fvap.gov to subscribe or follow FVAP on Facebook or Twitter.\n\nLearn more at the Federal Voting Assistance Program\u2019s (FVAP) website, FVAP.gov. If you have any questions about registering to vote overseas, please contact U.S. Embassy Warsaw\u2019s Voting Assistance Officer at ACSWarsaw@state.gov using the code V24 in the subject line. U.S. Consulate General Krakow can be reached at KrakowACS@state.gov, and the U.S. Consular Agency in Poznan can be reached at ConsularAgencyPoznan@state.gov.\n\nRemember, your vote counts!",

        "text": "Biden and Trump to face off in first US presidential debate: What to know\nJoe Biden and Donald Trump are going head-to-head in first debate ahead of November\u2019s hotly contested US election.\n\nThey have traded barbs for months, but Joe Biden and Donald Trump will soon get a chance to go head-to-head as the United States gears up for the first debate of the 2024 presidential election campaign.\n\nThe presumptive Democratic and Republican party nominees will take the debate stage in Atlanta, Georgia on Thursday evening, less than five months before the vote on November 5.\n\nOpinion polls show President Biden and ex-President Trump remain locked in a tight race that experts say could come down to a handful of key swing states.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about the debate and its potential impact on the campaign.\n\nWho is taking part in the debate?\n\nBiden, the Democratic incumbent, and his Republican challenger Trump are going up against each other for the first time in the 2024 election cycle. They last debated each other on October 22, 2020, as part of that year\u2019s presidential race.\n\nTo participate in the debate, presidential candidates had to meet a set of criteria set out by the US news network CNN, which is hosting the event.\n\nThis included having their name on enough state ballots to reach the Electoral College threshold needed to win the presidency, and having received at least 15 percent support in four separate national polls of registered and likely voters.\n\nWhere is the debate taking place and at what time?\n\nThe debate kicks off at 9pm local time (01:00 GMT) at CNN\u2019s studios in Atlanta.\n\nWho is hosting the debate?\n\nThe debate will be hosted by CNN anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash.\n\nWhat is the debate format?\n\nThe debate will last 90 minutes, with two commercial breaks, CNN said.\n\nBiden and Trump have agreed to appear behind podiums \u2014 as opposed to being seated \u2014 and their microphones will be muted unless it is their respective turn to speak.\n\n\u201cWhile no props or pre-written notes will be allowed on the stage, candidates will be given a pen, a pad of paper and a bottle of water,\u201d the network said.\n\nThere also will not be an audience, CNN said, in order \u201cto ensure candidates may maximize the time allotted in the debate\u201d.\n\nHow important are televised debates in a US presidential election?\n\nExperts have said most voters already know for whom they plan to vote in November, so it\u2019s unclear how much the debate will push the dial in favour of either candidate.\n\nStill, a Pew Research Center poll from 2016 found that 63 percent of voters said the presidential debates were very or somewhat helpful in deciding which White House hopeful to cast a ballot for.\n\nThat means Biden and Trump will try to use the event to appeal to a small group of \u201cswayable voters\u201d, explained Alan Schroeder, a professor emeritus of journalism at Northeastern University and author of the book Presidential Debates: Risky Business on the Campaign Trail.\n\nWith Biden and Trump locked in a neck-and-neck contest, those undecided voters could prove critical, Schroeder told Al Jazeera. \u201cAny time it\u2019s this close, a debate can be important simply because it has the potential to break that logjam.\u201d\n\nIs the debate happening earlier than usual? How come?\n\nYes. Biden and Trump had called for the 2024 presidential debates to happen earlier in the campaign, saying they wanted to make their pitches to American voters before the early-voting period opens.\n\nThe first presidential debates are typically held in the fall months \u2014 September and October \u2014 after the Republican and Democratic parties have held conventions to officially name their nominees.\n\nIt has also been a tradition since 1988 for the dates to be set by the Commission on Presidential Debates, a non-profit sponsored by the two major parties. Late last year, the commission announced that it had selected three dates: one in mid-September and two in October.\n\nBut last month, Biden\u2019s campaign announced plans to eschew the traditional schedule and push forward the first debate. It also trimmed the number of debates to two.\n\n\u201cThe Commission\u2019s schedule has debates that begin after the American people have a chance to cast their vote early, and doesn\u2019t conclude until after tens of millions of Americans will have already voted,\u201d the Biden campaign wrote.\n\nIt also said the commission\u2019s model of holding debates with large, in-person audiences \u201csimply isn\u2019t necessary or conducive to good debates\u201d.\n\nWhat topics are set to dominate?\n\nMany polls indicate the US economy remains the top concern for Americans ahead of the election, and the candidates will no doubt be asked about their economic platforms.\n\nImmigration, public safety and reproductive rights will also likely be debate topics, as they too rank high among voter concerns.\n\nForeign policy is also a topic of interest in this year\u2019s election, and candidates are expected to be asked about their positions towards Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, continued support for Ukraine and competition with China.\n\nIn addition, the state of the US\u2019s democratic institutions is high on voters\u2019 radars and is anticipated to come up on Thursday night. Biden has accused Trump of being a threat to democracy, after the former president\u2019s supporters stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021 to stop Congress from certifying the 2020 election results.\n\nThe Democrat could also try to bring up Trump\u2019s legal cases. The Republican was found guilty last month of falsifying business documents in a New York hush-money case, making him the first former president in US history ever convicted of a crime.\n\nBut pressing Trump on his conviction and legal troubles \u2014 the ex-president faces three other criminal indictments \u2014 could be risky, according to Schroeder at Northeastern University.\n\n\u201cDo you try to remind the audience over and over that he\u2019s now a convicted felon and there are other trials coming up, or does that look like overkill? Would that be something that audiences might not want to hear about?\u201d Schroeder asked.\n\nHow many people are expected to tune in?\n\nThat remains unclear.\n\nThe new 2024 debate schedule means the first event comes at a time when relatively few Americans are paying attention to the race, which could translate to low viewership.\n\nViewership also fluctuates greatly based on interest in the race and the appeal of the candidates. In April, the Pew Research Center found that nearly half of all registered voters said they would replace both candidates on the ballot if they could.\n\nAfter all, this year\u2019s race is a rematch of 2020, when Biden defeated Trump to win the White House, and some voters have expressed weariness with the two candidates.\n\nStill, Schroeder said he believes Americans will tune in to June\u2019s debate. \u201cTraditionally, presidential debates in the US are the second-highest rated programme after the Super Bowl.\u201d\n\nFor example, more than 73 million people tuned in across broadcast and cable networks for the first 2020 presidential election debate between Trump and Biden.\n\nAside from policy, what else will people be watching for?\n\nElaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution think-tank in Washington, DC, told Al Jazeera\u2019s Inside Story in mid-May that many Americans would be on the lookout for \u201chow vigorous each of these candidates is\u201d.\n\nKamarck noted that both Biden and Trump \u2014 who are 81 and 78 years old, respectively \u2014 have faced questions about their age and capacity to serve as president for another term.\n\n\u201cI think the debates will show the capacity of each of these men, both of whom are older than anybody we\u2019ve had running \u2014 ever,\u201d she said.\n\nSchroeder added that he would also be interested in seeing how the pair treat each other in the debate.\n\n\u201cAre they rude? Do they try to reach out a little bit and show some kindness or at least some humanity to the other side? Those are interesting things to watch,\u201d he said.\n\nHow can you watch Thursday\u2019s debate?\n\nThe debate will air on CNN channels and stream at CNN.com. In the US, it will also be available on the Max streaming platform. Other US television networks are also expected to carry the event.\n\nWhen is the next debate?\n\nBiden and Trump have agreed to a second debate on September 10, hosted by ABC News.",

Its voters could decide the election\n\ntoggle caption Ben Gray/AP\n\nJust under 12,000 votes separated Joe Biden and Donald Trump when they last appeared on the ballot in Georgia. Four years later, the rivals are preparing to share a debate stage this week in Atlanta as they fight for the slice of Georgia voters who could swing the presidential election.\n\nSome of those voters with outsize influence live in Alpharetta, a suburb of Atlanta where new subdivisions keep sprouting and have helped turn this formerly Republican stronghold purple. Reading a novel on a lounge chair in the sun at Alpharetta\u2019s Wills Park Pool, Kerry Webster is the kind of voter Biden and Trump need to persuade.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWebster says she is unhappy with her choices for president. And though she voted for Trump in 2020, he has since been convicted on 34 felony counts and faces more charges, including in Georgia.\n\nA grand jury indicted Trump just a few miles from the debate stage on charges that he attempted to overturn Georgia's 2020 presidential election result.\n\n\"He's a conniver. He's not really a good person \u2014 he's really not,\" Webster said. \"But the economy was better, and Biden, I don't know if he does a lot for us, hate to say.\"\n\nBut Webster does not plan to watch Thursday's debate. Despite living in a state and a suburban community that helped decide the presidency in 2020, she says she feels unmotivated about her options and has wondered whether her vote matters much anyway.\n\ntoggle caption Sam Gringlas/WABE\n\nPrasad and Mansi Vichare are keeping an eye on their kids splashing nearby as a DJ bumps Taylor Swift on repeat and older kids leap from a tall diving board for prizes. The Vichares identify as political independents. And though they definitely plan to vote, they think debates are a mostly useless exercise.\n\n\"To be honest, they're a waste, but that's just my opinion,\" Prasad said. \"I'm indifferent,\" added Mansi, who believes the candidates just tell people what they think they want to hear. \"I feel like it's somewhat fake, and so I don't know if it's really that helpful.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nA few lounge chairs away, Madalyn Ford is concerned that some voters have not internalized the stakes.\n\nFord says she has voted for both Republicans and Democrats, but never Trump. At 73, she worries about the U.S. that her grandkids will inherit and says she will not miss the debate.\n\n\"This is really important for Biden,\" Ford predicted. \"He better get a good night's rest. I don't think he's got dementia, but he's old and this is super-important.\"\n\nPolls suggest that Biden has gained ground with older voters, particularly women. But support from younger voters of color, who have long been Democrats' bread and butter, appears to be softening.\n\nMillennial Deanna McKay says she has struggled with whether her vote matters. McKay voted for Trump in 2016 and Biden in 2020. She says she will watch this debate with an open mind.\n\n\"Socially Biden, but financially Trump, and that's kind of a tough place to be,\" she explained. \"But it's a little frustrating because these aren't the two candidates I would choose.\"\n\nMcKay says she cares most about affordable housing and reproductive rights. She says she does not directly fault Trump for the overturn of Roe v. Wade, despite his three appointments that cemented a conservative majority on the Supreme Court.\n\n\n\nField operations take shape as voting nears\n\nThis month, the Trump campaign opened its first Georgia field office in a tidy brick building that's 20 miles south of Atlanta and shared with an insurance agency. On a recent weekday, staffers invited supporters to tour the campaign's inaugural field office, grab coffee and doughnuts and sign up to volunteer.\n\ntoggle caption Jeff Amy/AP\n\nBen Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development under Trump, traveled to Georgia for the grand opening and described the choice that voters face in November with an analogy.\n\n\"Would you rather have the surgeon who has a bad bedside manner but saves everybody, or the one with a very sweet personality who kills everybody?\" Carson asked. \"Which one would you take?\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe Trump campaign says it now has more than a dozen staffed field offices in the state, though Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, recently raised concerns that the Trump campaign's ground game in Georgia may be lagging.\n\n\"This year it will be clearer than ever that Georgians are ready to help send their state's sixteen electoral votes to the GOP column this fall,\" Henry Scavone, the Republican National Committee's communications director in Georgia, said in a statement.\n\nAfter Biden managed to flip Georgia blue in 2020, becoming the first Democratic presidential candidate to carry the state since 1992, Republicans swept nearly every statewide office in the midterm elections that followed. Democratic U.S. Senator Raphael Warnock won reelection that year in a runoff, the one exception.\n\nDemocrats still believe Georgia is winnable and see a strong ground game as crucial to notching more wins. Ahead of the debate, the Biden campaign says it will hold 200 events in Georgia, looking to leverage the national spotlight and the side-by-side view of the two candidates.\n\nJonae Wartel, the Biden campaign's senior adviser in Georgia, says deploying a presence statewide, not just in the Democratic stronghold of metro Atlanta, is a key feature of the campaign's Georgia strategy. The campaign says it has 14 Georgia field offices and will hit 100 staffers here by the end of the week.\n\n\"Right here in our backyard, the world is going to be watching how President Biden is fit to lead us into another four-year administration and Donald Trump is continuing to be a threat,\" Wartel says. \"That contrast is going to be on full display. It's the campaign's job to take advantage of that.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm very nervous, I\u2019ll be honest\"\n\ntoggle caption Sam Gringlas/WABE\n\nMost polls have shown Biden trailing Trump in Georgia.

Some lay on stretchers, hooked to IV bags. That didn\u2019t stop Trump from railing as he often does against wind turbines and electric vehicles \u2014 technologies experts say would curb climate pollution and prevent the kind of extreme heat that laid out his supporters.\n\nFor years, Trump has cast doubt on the scientific consensus that the Earth is getting hotter mainly because of burning fossil fuels. Recently, he dismissed the threat of rising sea levels. And Trump told fossil fuel executives they should raise $1 billion for his presidential campaign because he would roll back environmental regulations and unleash oil and gas drilling.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMeanwhile, conservative activists, including former Trump administration officials, have formed an ambitious presidential transition operation called Project 2025. It calls for abolishing federal programs that address climate change and repealing Biden administration-backed laws that give billions in funding and tax incentives for corporations and communities to adopt renewable energy.\n\n\u201cFor companies with technologies that rely on government tax credits, yes, they should be very worried,\u201d says Diana Furchtgott-Roth, director of the Center for Energy, Climate, and Environment at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that produced Project 2025\u2019s governing agenda, \u201cMandate for Leadership.\u201d\n\nArmed with such an agenda, a second Trump term could slow the country\u2019s shift away from fossil fuels. But it probably won\u2019t entirely halt the transition to renewable energy, industry analysts and researchers say. That\u2019s because the costs for a lot of those technologies are falling fast, they say. Companies are seeing financial benefits in cutting emissions. And states led by Democrats and Republicans alike are reaping economic benefits from new factories and power plants.\n\nStill, any delay in reducing climate pollution poses risks, because the world needs to move much faster than it is now to rein in the worsening effects of global warming, scientists say. Last year was the hottest on record, and the next decade will probably be even hotter, research shows. And that warming brings heat waves, storms and wildfires that displace, sicken and kill thousands of people worldwide, including Americans.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cThe potential widespread harm that can emerge as a result of another decade of confusion and disorganization \u2014 it's hard to articulate the magnitude of those costs to society,\u201d says Solomon Hsiang, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nIn response to questions for this story, the Trump campaign provided a statement by senior advisor Brian Hughes saying Trump would make the country energy independent. \u201cPresident Trump is committed to unleashing American energy sources like coal, oil, and gas to ensure affordability for families and security in the world by making us a more self-sufficient nation,\u201d Hughes said.\n\ntoggle caption Jim Watson/AFP via Getty\n\nConservatives prepare for a second Trump term\n\nSince Trump left office in 2021, conservative activists have worked to create a political apparatus for his return to the White House.\n\nThe idea behind Project 2025 and similar initiatives is to \u201cgear up and be prepared, both in terms of personnel but also policy vision,\u201d says Quill Robinson, an associate fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a bipartisan think tank, and a senior advisor at a conservative environmental group called ConservAmerica.\n\nProject 2025 is a nearly 1,000-page document that calls for remaking nearly the entire federal government, with a central goal of expanding presidential power. From abolishing the Education Department to overhauling the Justice Department to limit its independence, the plan represents a sweeping effort \u201cto rescue the country from the grip of the radical Left.\u201d\n\nAlthough it\u2019s garnered the most attention, Project 2025 is one of several conservative policy proposals Trump is expected to choose from if he\u2019s reelected.\n\nThe plan minimizes threats from global warming, and its policy proposals are designed to bring about a \u201cwhole-of-government unwinding\u201d of the Biden administration\u2019s climate strategy.\n\n\u201cThe people who put that [plan] together believe that America has given up its energy dominance, brought about primarily by hydrocarbons, fossil fuels,\u201d says Brigham McCown, director of the Initiative on American Energy Security at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank. \u201cAnd so they want to see a return to that.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nDespite Biden\u2019s focus on limiting climate change, the U.S. has produced and exported a record amount of oil under his administration. Furchtgott-Roth of the Heritage Foundation says that with different policies, the country could produce even more.\n\nProject 2025 says the next conservative administration needs to \u201cstop the war on oil and natural gas\u201d and support an \u201call of the above'' energy policy. The plan\u2019s recommendations include:\n\n\n\nPreventing federal regulators from considering the economic impact of carbon emissions;\n\nAbolishing the Energy Department\u2019s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and Loan Programs Office, which funds cutting-edge energy and manufacturing projects;\n\nEliminating energy efficiency standards for appliances;\n\nEnding subsidies for electric vehicles;\n\nWithdrawing the country from initiatives for sustainable food production;\n\nAnd rescinding climate policies from foreign aid programs.\n\nThe plan also calls for repealing Biden\u2019s signature climate initiatives: the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The laws signed by Biden put more than $500 billion toward climate action and are packed with funding for the manufacture and use of technologies that cut planet-heating emissions. They represent the biggest public investments in \u201cclean energy and transportation\u201d in U.S. history, according to analysts at the Rhodium Group, with the potential to cut the country\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions by up to 42% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels.\n\nFurchtgott-Roth says the incentives are a wasteful handout to corporations. \u201cI think we should roll back these energy subsidies, let the chips fall where they may, and allow people to choose the least-expensive electricity options that meet their needs,\u201d she says.\n\nThe goal, Furchtgott-Roth says, is for \u201cAmerica to be independent, use its sources of domestic energy and continue with the path to cleaner air.\u201d\n\ntoggle caption Mandl Ngan/AFP via Getty Images\n\nLooking back at the first term to gauge a second Trump administration\n\nEven with road maps like Project 2025 at his fingertips, it\u2019s hard to know what Trump would do in a second term.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHe\u2019s \u201cunpredictable,\u201d says Robinson of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. While Trump has mocked recent clean-energy spending as a \u201cgreen new scam,\u201d Robinson says investments the country is making in manufacturing through the Inflation Reduction Act seem like they\u2019d appeal to Trump.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a deal to be made and there are jobs at stake, from a populist standpoint, he\u2019s for it,\u201d says McCown of the Hudson Institute.\n\nUltimately, McCown says a second Trump administration would be shaped by whomever Trump surrounds himself with. Trump has \u201ccertain ideas,\u201d McCown says, \u201cbut when it comes to the policies, the implementation, the actual strategy, a lot of that, I think, is going to be left to their cabinet officials to do and to other people. Because he's a 30,000-foot guy.\u201d\n\nDuring Trump's first term, his administration rolled back dozens of environmental protections, according to an analysis by the Brookings Institution. Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement on climate change; tried to weaken regulations on power plant emissions; opened part of Alaska\u2019s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas development; and eased a rule that was designed to reduce polluted wastewater from coal plants.\n\nIf Trump\u2019s reelected, environmental groups will almost certainly file lawsuits challenging the administration\u2019s actions. Some of those cases could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, which Trump reshaped in his first term to create a 6 to 3 conservative supermajority.\n\nWhile the conservative justices diverge on some rulings, their decisions regarding the environment have curtailed the federal government\u2019s authority to protect it, making the Supreme Court arguably Trump\u2019s most potent climate legacy.\n\nIn 2022, the Supreme Court limited the power of the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate carbon emissions from power plants. And last year, it curtailed the EPA\u2019s authority over wetlands, which improve water quality and reduce flood risks. Now, allies of the fossil fuel industry are pressing the court to side with oil and gas companies in a climate lawsuit that could cost them billions of dollars.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nTrump has said that if he\u2019s reelected, he\u2019d try to block lawsuits that attempt to hold the oil and gas industry responsible for some of the damages from global warming.\n\ntoggle caption Mario Tama/Getty Images/Getty Images North America\n\nThe election\u2019s about the \u2018pace of change\u2019\n\nDespite all that, Trump would be hard pressed to steer U.S. energy markets in a completely different direction, or to change how companies approach climate change.\n\nFor starters, U.S. oil and gas production is influenced by global prices: Companies drill more when prices are high and less when they\u2019re low. U.S. presidents have very little sway over those corporate decisions and, ultimately, fuel prices.\n\n\u201cThere's no magic spigot to turn on overnight,\u201d says McCown of the Hudson Institute.\n\nIt\u2019s also unlikely that Congress would repeal the Inflation Reduction Act, say analysts like David Brown, director of the energy transition practice at Wood Mackenzie, a research firm. Republicans\u2019 unsuccessful push to overturn President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act underscores how hard it is to undo legislation. And a big chunk of the money in the Inflation Reduction Act is flowing to red states.\n\nIn a recent survey, 62% of registered voters said they\u2019d prefer to vote for a politician who supports action on global warming, and 63% said developing sources of clean energy should be a high or very high priority for the president and Congress. The polling was done this spring by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and the Center for Climate Change Communication at George Mason University.\n\n\u201cI don't see [Trump] spending his political capital on pulling the rug out from under new EV manufacturing in states like South Carolina and Georgia and Tennessee,\u201d Robinson says. \u201cThat just doesn't politically make sense.\u201d\n\nEnergy analysts say companies making those kinds of investments are committed to reducing emissions. Many move slower than activists would like, and some have delayed plans to reassess their strategies. But they\u2019re under pressure to take action from their customers and investors, who are feeling the impacts of climate change in their own lives.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cClimate change is not abstract anymore,\u201d says Geoff Gisler, who oversees legal work at the Southern Environmental Law Center. \u201cAnd the connection between how we get our energy and the consequences of climate change, I think it's a very real, tangible thing to folks.\u201d\n\nMany corporations have also concluded that transitioning away from fossil fuels is good for their bottom lines, because there are \u201cdemonstrated savings\u201d from renewable energy, Brown says.\n\nJohn Ketchum, chief executive of NextEra Energy, said in an interview with Bloomberg News in June that he expects renewable energy will be used to meet the bulk of rising U.S. power demand in the coming decades, partly because natural gas plants are more expensive. NextEra owns one of America\u2019s largest utilities, which used natural gas to generate about three-quarters of its electricity last year. But NextEra\u2019s investments have also placed it among the world\u2019s biggest renewable energy companies.\n\nMeanwhile, actions Trump might take to aid fossil fuel companies could help other parts of the energy industry, as well. For example, Republicans want to overhaul environmental permitting to make it easier to build things like oil and gas pipelines. Easing regulations could also speed construction of wind and solar projects.\n\nThis election is about the \u201cpace of change\u201d in the energy industry, and how fast the country can cut emissions in the coming decades, says Brown of Wood Mackenzie.\n\nIf Trump is reelected, Wood Mackenzie expects the U.S. would move more slowly in reducing carbon pollution, but it wouldn\u2019t stop. \u201cIt does not mean that you stop electrification or you stop retiring coal plants or electric vehicles are a thing of the past starting with the next administration, if it's a Trump administration,\u201d Brown says.\n\ntoggle caption Noah Berger/AP/FR34727 AP\n\nLimiting warming will take decades\n\nYet a potential slowdown in U.S. climate action would come at a time of worsening disasters fueled by global warming.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThis year will be among the five hottest. As the Earth warms, heat waves are becoming more frequent and severe, taking a big toll on people\u2019s health. Scientists say that trend will continue as long as humans keep releasing greenhouse gasses, largely from using fossil fuels. The kind of sweltering heat that sickened Trump supporters in Phoenix is a hallmark of human-caused climate change.\n\nThe United Nations says the world needs to cut or offset all carbon pollution by midcentury to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, compared to temperatures in the late 1800s. Beyond that point, scientists say the impacts of climate change could get even more dangerous for people and critical ecosystems than what\u2019s already happened.\n\nTo meet such a huge challenge, countries need to act now to lay the groundwork for a massive buildout of clean energy in the coming decades, says Brown of Wood Mackenzie.\n\n\u201cWhat happens in the next five years really matters from a long-term perspective in terms of reaching climate goals,\u201d he says.\n\nWaiting will increase global warming\u2019s costs on society, says Hsiang of the University of California, Berkeley. Some are obvious: Lives and property lost to floods and wildfires. Others are often overlooked because they aren\u2019t as striking, Hsiang says. Like the rise in violence that researchers have observed in extreme heat, or children learning less when temperatures soar.\n\n\"It's like a million small things that when they add up and accumulate, they lead to just a totally different world,\u201d Hsiang says. \u201cIt's not just like some disaster that we muscle through and then afterward, we're okay on the other side.\u201d\n\n",

        "text": "The newest deciders: Almost 2 million women have become U.S. citizens since the 2020 election\nThe 19th is committed to covering the unfinished business of voting rights. Read more about how we\u2019re approaching that in this pivotal election.\n\nWhen Becky Insook Kim immigrated to the United States from Korea in 1995, she was a 37-year-old mother of two who soon had a job as a cashier at a cleaner\u2019s in Souderton, Pennsylvania, about 35 miles north of Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cIn her head, she thought she would have a better job and more opportunities,\u201d said Alice Min, Kim\u2019s adult daughter. Min interpreted for her mother, who spoke Korean during a recent interview. \u201cShe had to work 16-hour shifts to just provide food for our family. And it was more struggles than what she thought.\u201d\n\nIn March \u2014 nearly 30 years after she first came to the United States \u2014 Kim became a U.S. citizen. This election cycle will mark her first as an eligible voter, and she plans to vote in Texas, where she resides.\n\n\u201cShe is very excited to raise her voice as a U.S. citizen,\u201d Min said of her mother\u2019s voting plans. \u201cShe still cannot believe that she is a U.S. citizen.\u201d\n\nIn a pivotal election year where the presidential contests in some battleground states may be decided by a few thousand votes, the turnout of eligible immigrant women voters \u2014 some of whom say they\u2019re mindful of how immigration policy is being debated \u2014 could decide the outcome of the rematch between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump.\n\nImmigrant voters are not monolithic, but they have also shown more support for the Democratic Party.\n\nAnd the Democratic Party has generally in recent years had more immigrant-friendly policies. Biden announced plans this month to reduce deportations of the spouses of U.S. citizens and to let some immigrants who arrived here as children to more quickly receive work visas. Biden has also supported some Trump-era restrictions on asylum seekers at the U.S.- Mexico border.\n\nTrump, who was recently convicted of 34 felony counts related to falsified business records tied to the 2016 election, has promised to deport millions of undocumented immigrants if he\u2019s reelected. He has also attempted to spread disinformation about noncitizen voting in federal elections, which is virtually nonexistent.\n\nNewly naturalized citizens like Kim are a growing share of the American electorate \u2014 since the 2020 election, an estimated 3.5 million immigrants have become naturalized U.S. citizens. Fifty-five percent, or nearly 2 million people, are women.\n\nAn impromptu network of immigrant women leaders have been credited with helping their communities with citizenship services. But the reason for the gender gap may come down to who is able to complete the lengthy naturalization process.\n\n\u201cThe main reason there are more women naturalizing than men is there are more women eligible to naturalize than men, because there are more legal immigrants who are women,\u201d said Jeff Pastel, a senior demographer at the Pew Research Center.\n\nIn addition, immigrant men appear to be deported at a higher rate than immigrant women, in part because they\u2019re arrested at a higher rate.\n\n\u201cThe big thing is, who\u2019s allowed to get to the finish line?,\u201d said Nancy Flores, deputy director for the National Partnership for New Americans (NPNA), a national organization that promotes immigration equity in policy and is promoting a campaign to register more newly eligible immigrant voters ahead of the November election. She has seen firsthand how women are propelled to the head of their households because of deportations that target their spouses and partners.\n\n\u201cThat does pull people into being more active and saying, \u2018I\u2019m not OK with just becoming a green card holder. I need to ultimately become a citizen,\u2019\u201d Flores added.\n\nThese are not new motivations. When Obdulia Alvarez applied for citizenship more than 20 years ago, she was a single parent with two young daughters. One of those children was Flores.\n\nAlvarez immigrated to the United States from Mexico, the top country of origin for newly eligible voters. After a brief stint in California, she brought her children to rural Wisconsin. She knew quickly she wanted to become a U.S. citizen.\n\n\u201cI was thinking of my kids,\u201d Alvarez said on her reasoning. \u201cI was thinking, \u2018I need to get my citizenship. I have to vote.\u2019\u201d\n\nAlvarez said that since her first visit to a polling place as an eligible voter in the late 1990s, she has tried to never miss an election. She also encourages people who attend her church to get out and vote.\n\nNaturalized citizens are less likely to register to vote than U.S.-born citizens, according to research published in 2016. Among the reasons: fear, a lack of information and language barriers.\n\nBut the same 2016 research concluded that once newly eligible voters are registered, they vote at similar rates to U.S.-born citizens.\n\nFlores believes another reason women are becoming naturalized citizens at a higher rate is because women tend to lead community outreach that helps people with immigration and citizenship services. Flores said that creates a loop in which they\u2019re more likely to have the information they need to begin the lengthy application process.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing that a lot of them are really the ones that are kind of taking leadership and saying, \u2018Naturalization has transformed my life. I really kind of want to pay it forward,\u2019 Flores added. \u201cSo we\u2019re seeing a lot of these wonderful \u2018community navigators\u2019 becoming citizens themselves and then also being part of cohorts that are then getting deputized on naturalization and going out there in the community.\u201d\n\nFabiola Landeros does community outreach for the organization El Centro in September 2023 in New Mexico. (Felipe Vazquez)\n\nIt\u2019s how Fabiola Landeros, a community organizer in New Mexico, began her citizenship journey. She was connecting immigrants with citizenship services through an organization called El Centro \u2014 but she was not a U.S. citizen. A single mother to three children, Landeros said it was her kids who persuaded her to reconsider her immigration status.\n\n\u201cMy kids turned to me and they were like, \u2018Hey mom, when are you going to become a U.S. citizen? The work that you do, we see that many organizers are targeted. And the last thing we want is for you to get deported,\u2019\u201d she recalled, noting that noncitizen organizers can inadvertently get on the radar of immigration officials.\n\nThe conversation set Landeros into action. She became a naturalized citizen in 2019 \u2014 in time for her to vote alongside her oldest, who was 18 at the time. She brought along her two younger kids to the polling place. She said she hasn\u2019t missed an opportunity to vote since then.\n\n\u201cI wanted to make sure that they see the importance of going in and voting,\u201d she said.\n\nThe issues propelling immigrant women to vote this election varies. For Kim, it\u2019s wage equity. For Alavarez, it\u2019s \u201ca better government.\u201d Landeros said immigration is a top issue for her, and she wants politicians to stop scapegoating immigrants.\n\nSign up for more news and context delivered to your inbox, daily You have been subscribed!

Women have certainly played a pivotal role in that. We\u2019re seeing it in the numbers, we\u2019re seeing it in the advocacy, we\u2019re seeing it in the community.\u201d\n\nData visuals reporter Jasmine Mithani contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Young voters have growing power, but broken politics leave them \u2018fatalistic,\u2019 studies find\nYoung voters from the millennial generation and Gen Z are emerging as the demographic center of power in American politics, but new studies by UC Berkeley researchers find they are fatalistic about critical problems such as economic inequality, climate change and the future of democracy.\n\nYounger voters had a broad, decisive impact on the 2020 presidential election and congressional elections in 2018 and 2022, according to research released today by the Berkeley Institute for Young Americans (BIFYA). Now, with the 2024 presidential election just months away, the institute\u2019s analysis raises concerns about possibly low turnout among young voters in November.\n\nTwo new studies offer a deeply detailed look at the social values and political behaviors of voters aged 18-43 \u2014 and jarring insights into their generational zeitgeist. Some findings diverge sharply from prevailing stereotypes about the political behavior of young voters.\n\nSurprisingly, the institute reports, the values of Gen Z and millennial voters across the political spectrum are converging toward agreement on key issues. But the researchers found a substantial generation gap in American politics: Both young liberals and young conservatives want effective government action to solve challenges, while their parents and grandparents have been in conflict for a half-century over the role of government.\n\nAt the same time, however, many young voters appear to share a belief that fractured, dysfunctional government systems are incapable of addressing critical challenges that fall heavily on their generations. A sense of fatalism extends across the right, center and left, according to the researchers.\n\nSarah Swanbeck, executive director of the Berkeley Institute for Young Americans (left), and Erin Heys, the institute\u2019s policy director, in their UC Berkeley office. Brandon S\u00e1nchez Mejia/UC Berkeley\n\n\u201cMillennials and Gen Zers are generations unlike any other because of the risks they face,\u201d said Erin Heys, the institute\u2019s policy director and senior researcher. \u201cFrom the housing crisis to the threat of climate change and AI, young people are feeling hopeless about the challenges in front of them, and are disillusioned with a political system that is unresponsive to their needs.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn this pivotal election year, whether or not young people decide to vote could very well decide the outcome of the election,\u201d said Sarah Swanbeck, BIFYA\u2019s executive director. \u201cThese new papers give us an important first glimpse into one factor that could affect whether or not young people turn up at the polls: their increasing feeling of fatalism and a sense that the American Dream is farther and farther out of reach.\u201d\n\nThe Berkeley institute, founded in 2015, undertakes pathbreaking research to better understand the unique challenges that younger generations are facing and to develop the public policy interventions needed to solve them. The institute is affiliated with Berkeley\u2019s Goldman School of Public Policy.\n\nA historic passing of power from old to young\n\nThe institute\u2019s new research comes at a generational inflection point in U.S. politics.\n\nIncumbent President Joe Biden is 81 years old, and his challenger, former President Donald Trump, is 78. It\u2019s almost certain that the 2024 election will represent the end of an era in which politicians from the World War II and post-war generations dominated U.S. political leadership.\n\nBy some measures, millennials and Gen Z voters by 2028 will account for half of the electorate. And millions of young Gen Zers will be eligible to vote for the first time this year.\n\nAs a group, those tens of millions of young Americans face risks that older generations could scarcely imagine: extreme economic inequality, climate change and warp-speed technological change that is shaking political and economic stability in the U.S. and much of the world.\n\nThe values of young conservatives \u2026 are changing, with young conservatives more egalitarian and fatalistic in comparison to older age cohorts of conservatives.\n\nThe Berkeley research finds that they\u2019re disillusioned because older generations have failed to address those and other problems and seem to be simply handing them off to their children.\n\nHow will younger voters respond?\n\nWhile they have the numbers to determine the outcome of elections, the new BIFYA study points to other research showing that young conservatives are defecting from the Republican Party, just as millions of young liberals and progressives are disconnecting from the Democratic Party.\n\nMany are so disillusioned that they could opt out of political engagement altogether, the research finds. That concern is underscored in a new poll by the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies (IGS), which finds that many voters \u2014 and especially young voters \u2014 may stay home on Election Day because they don\u2019t like the choices.\n\nBut, the institute\u2019s research concludes, the change of generations also may create conditions for younger elected leaders to put aside political warfare and seek instead new ideas to solve problems.\n\nWalk away from politics? Or rise up and change the world?\n\nThe Berkeley institute\u2019s new research comes in two working papers that explore the complex factors that shape political attitudes and behavior, and additional papers are planned for release in the coming months.\n\nIn the study \u201cGenerational Values and Political Participation in Recent U.S. Elections,\u201d Heys describes millennials and Gen Zers as a contingent that is \u201cfundamentally different\u201d from earlier generations.\n\nThey have endured the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and the Great Recession in 2008. They have witnessed the election of Barack Obama, the nation\u2019s first Black president, and the election of Donald Trump, whose MAGA allies attempted to overturn the 2020 presidential election by force.\n\nThese voters are more diverse and more tech-savvy, and they have contributed forcefully to movements such as Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter. The COVID pandemic, too, made a lasting cultural imprint on the generation.\n\nMillennial and Gen Z voters are more diverse and more liberal, and they\u2019ve been critical in driving the influence of social movements such as Black Lives Matter and Occupy Wall Street. UC Berkeley photo\n\nThey have emerged from those crucible experiences as decisively more liberal than earlier generations, Heys writes. Their values are more egalitarian. They have a more critical view of the flaws in American democracy and the unequal distribution of wealth and power.\n\nIndeed, she found that values among young conservatives and liberals are more \u201chomogenous\u201d than for older generations.\n\n\u201cThe values of young conservatives, in particular, are changing, with young conservatives more egalitarian and fatalistic in comparison to older age cohorts of conservatives,\u201d Heys writes. \u201cThis changing value structure may play out in the attitudes of young conservatives, who have been found to hold more liberal views on issues like racial equality, climate change, universal health care and abortion.\u201d\n\nHeys cites other research showing that fewer than half of young people who grew up in\n\nconservative households now consider themselves Republicans. But, she adds, the trend is similar for the Democratic Party.\n\nIndeed, dissatisfaction with the political status quo seems widespread \u2014 and that translates into a sense of fatalism.\n\n\u201cYoung people think that much in their lives is outside of their control,\u201d she writes. They \u201care pessimistic about their own futures and the fate of the country, and are feeling pessimistic about the American Dream, believing that while it was once true, it is no longer within reach for younger generations.\u201d\n\nClear and troubling implications for future elections\n\nThe institute expands on these themes in \u201cCultural Evolution: Measuring Differences in Generational Values.\u201d\n\nEvidence has been accumulating for years \u201cthat young people across the ideological spectrum are more tolerant and open-minded toward people from all backgrounds, and are more likely to support progressive policy issues,\u201d Heys writes.\n\nA key finding is that young people across political boundaries are more likely to believe \u201cthat government should do more to solve society\u2019s problems, even if it means higher taxes for all,\u201d the study says. But the failure of government to address issues that directly affect the lives of young people \u2014 such as climate, and the costs of education, housing and health care \u2014 fuels pervasive fatalism.\n\nCandidates looking to engage with and inspire this group of young voters will need to provide an antidote to this sense of dread by offering real solutions. Sarah Swanbeck, BIFYA executive director\n\nYet the trends are not uniform. Heys find young men skew more toward individualism, and that young women lean more toward egalitarian values. And among young people of color, there is a trend toward more individualism and a less egalitarian, collective orientation.\n\nWhat\u2019s the political impact of these values? In a series of interviews with young voters, BIFYA found that \u201cyoung people who chose not to vote in the 2020 election were disillusioned with the political system and thought it had been taken over by special interests. They \u2026 did not think that the political system represented their interests or responded to the economic, social, and environmental risks they faced in their everyday lives.\u201d\n\nThose findings have clear \u2014 and troubling \u2014 implications for November\u2019s election and future elections.\n\nStill, the institute\u2019s leaders see a path toward political hope and healing as the younger Americans rise into power.\n\n\u201cWe are encouraged that young people from across the ideological spectrum are more aligned in their value structure than their elders,\u201d Heys said. \u201cThis means that as younger generations become the dominant electoral force in the years ahead, they\u2019ll be more likely to coalesce around new policy ideas to solve today\u2019s pressing problems.\u201c\n\nBut for that to happen, Swanbeck added, \u201ccandidates looking to engage with and inspire this group of young voters will need to provide an antidote to this sense of dread by offering real solutions to the existential threats with which younger generations are grappling.\u201d",

But it is foreign policy that has consumed much of his time during his first term, including in the direct lead-up to Thursday\u2019s debate, when Biden embarked upon back-to-back trips to Europe.\n\nHis close advisers have candidly acknowledged, particularly since October 7, that events abroad have more than once \u2013 and more than his team would like \u2013 diverted the president\u2019s attention away from important domestic issues.\n\nUnlike previous presidential election cycles, there is not a scheduled debate dedicated only to foreign policy, which in the past provided an opportunity for in-depth contrasts on world affairs between Republican and Democratic candidates.\n\nAs much as the Biden team would prefer to stay focused on issues close to home, it has also long viewed foreign policy as one of the clearest ways to demonstrate a contrast with Trump on presidential leadership.\n\nOne campaign official told CNN that if and when foreign policy issues come up Thursday night, the contrast that Biden will try to paint could not be starker.",

        "text": "Ahead of Biden-Trump debate, Georgia voters weigh 2024 decision\n'It's in God's hands now': Georgia voters brace for close election\n\nBrandon Drenon/BBC Torino Henry (left) says he thinks both Joe Biden and Donald Trump are bad candidates. He doesn't plan on voting for either\n\nJoe Biden defeated Donald Trump by fewer than 12,000 votes to win the crucial state of Georgia in the 2020 election, elevating its status as an influential political battleground. The two men will face off in the first presidential debate in Atlanta on Thursday, putting a spotlight on the pivotal role Georgia will again play in November.\n\nOn a hot summer Sunday, hundreds gathered in Atlanta's Piedmont Park to celebrate Juneteenth, America\u2019s newest national holiday, which commemorates the end of slavery. There were smiles and laughter. Corn dogs and curly fries. Pride and pain. Jimmy Hill was there, resting beneath the shade of a tree. He sat next to an installation of columns erected in the park, each decorated with synthetic roses and the faces of black Americans shot and killed by police. One of the faces \u2013 Jimmy Atchison \u2013 was Mr Hill\u2019s son. Mr Hill voted for Joe Biden in 2020, lured by the Democratic candidate\u2019s promises for police reform. \u201cI\u2019ve always voted Democrat,\u201d the 62-year-old said. But four years later, his allegiance to the party is beginning to waver. \u201c[Biden] hasn\u2019t done anything on police reform,\u201d Mr Hill said. \u201cThe conversation has gone out the back door.\u201d\n\nBrandon Drenon/BBC Jimmy Hill has seen two sons killed by guns. He's voting against lawmakers that wish to ease gun access\n\nHis uncertainty reflects broader concerns among Georgia's black and Latino population, a reliable Democratic voting bloc now showing signs of a crumbling coalition. The group voted in record numbers in 2020, helping Joe Biden to win the state by less than 1%. The upset victory arrived on the heels of a long-diversifying population and high-profile local Democrats also on the ballot. On Thursday, a mile from the Juneteenth celebration in Piedmont Park, President Biden and his Republican opponent Donald Trump will come under the lights of the primetime television debate stage for the first time in four years. Each man - president and former president - will be trying to convince the nation that they deserve another term in the White House. The road to get there runs through battleground states like Georgia, where voters know they play an outsized role in deciding who becomes president. In November, the razor-thin race is set to be decided here and in a handful of other states across the nation: Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada. Current polling shows Mr Biden has lost significant ground in Georgia. A March survery by the BBC\u2019s media partner CBS News found the former president leading President Biden by 3%.\n\nBrandon Drenon/BBC Shaun Gray (left) says he will not vote for Joe Biden and is considering Donald Trump\n\nA \u2018perfect storm\u2019 in 2020\n\nBefore 2020, a Democratic candidate for president hadn\u2019t been elected in Georgia since 1992. But a confluence of unique events helped push Joe Biden over the line, including record voter turnout from the state\u2019s growing population of young, black and Latino voters. In 2020, a deadly pandemic had engulfed the globe and shut down much of daily life. The election also came amid a nationwide racial reckoning following widespread protests over the police killings of George Floyd and other black Americans \u2014 an issue Mr Biden vowed to tackle on the campaign trail. Two months after Mr Biden\u2019s win, the state elected two Democrats, including its first black senator, Raphael Warnock, to the US Senate, in runoff elections. The upset victories flipped the state\u2019s two seats from red to blue and handed control of the upper chamber to Democrats. \u201c2020 was a different beast,\u201d said Kendra Cotton, executive director of the New Georgia Project, a non-partisan organisation that leads voter outreach efforts among metro Atlanta\u2019s communities of colour. \u201cWhen you talk about getting people out, it was like a perfect storm.\u201d Many in Georgia attribute record turnout to the state\u2019s grassroots coalition, a decade-long project led by Democrat and former gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams. Abrams founded the New Georgia Project and Fair Fight, two of Georgia\u2019s largest voting rights organisations. But many of the dynamics that motivated black and Latino voters and powered Mr Biden\u2019s win have disappeared. And some organisers worry new challenges \u2013 from inflation to the Israel-Gaza war \u2013 are causing Mr Biden\u2019s grip on the consequential voting bloc to slip. \u201cPeople are concerned about the cost of living. The rising housing costs. The lack of affordability,\u201d Ms Cotton said. The fallout from the Israel-Gaza war is \u201csomething that\u2019s weighing on the hearts and minds of voters we reach out to,\u201d she added. \u201cVoters are not enthusiastic about their choices.\" The 2024 landscape has left Republicans and Democrats puzzled about what will happen in November. Elisha Bennett, a Republican, put it this way: \u201cIt\u2019s in God\u2019s hands now.\u201d\n\nBrandon Drenon/BBC Trump paraphernalia on sale at the Trump Store & More in East Ellijay, Georgia\n\nTrump \u2018took care of us\u2019\n\nRoughly 77 miles (123km) north of Atlanta, in the rolling hills of East Ellijay, the tone among voters contrasts heavily with those at Piedmont Park. There, amid the pockets of wild daisies and gun stores dotting the road, lies the Trump Store & More. \u201cI voted for Trump in 2016, and 2020, and I will vote for him again,\u201d Fran Diemer, the store\u2019s clerk, said. \u201cHe\u2019s the best thing to ever happen to this country and we need him back.\u201d Standing behind the counter, where Trump\u2019s face appears on everything from pins to pocketknives, she reflected on his presidency with a big grin. \u201cGas was cheap. Groceries were cheap. Taxes were cheap. He took care of us,\u201d she said. On Sunday, the same day as Atlanta\u2019s final Juneteenth celebration, people in East Ellijay gathered at the Lions Club Fairgrounds to view the Vietnam Traveling Memorial Wall, about two miles from the Trump store. Gloria Murphy, a nearby resident, came there to pay tribute to her high school friend that was killed in the war. Like, Ms Diemer, she had also consistently voted for Trump and said her enthusiasm to do so again remained high. \u201cThe economy, the war, it\u2019s just disheartening to see everybody fighting,\u201d she said. \u201cSince Biden has been in office, people\u2019s sense of patriotism has dwindled. I\u2019m hoping Trump can restore that somehow.\u201d Margot, a Trump supporter who was also at the memorial but did not want to share her last name, said: \u201cIf nothing changes politically, it is going to be, in my opinion, a very different and very scary world.\u201d\n\nBrandon Drenon/BBC Gloria Murphy's high school friend Fred Bonner was killed in the Vietnam War. His name is listed on the wall behind her\n\nA changing demographic landscape\n\nThere are 159 counties in Georgia, and most of them are like East Ellijay\u2019s Gilmer County: rural and Republican. But roughly 45% of the state\u2019s population lives in just 10 counties, in the dense urban areas that make up metro Atlanta. These counties have seen a population boom in the last 10-plus years, driven by a swell in young, college-educated, racially and ethnically diverse groups \u2013 typically Democratic leaning. When Joe Biden won in 2020, he extended the lead for Democrats in many of these areas, including some counties where, in 2012, and decades prior, a Republican had won. Cobb, Gwinnett and Henry County are three that flipped from Republican to Democrat in 2016. That year, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton narrowly won each county with an average 50.2% of votes. President Biden grew that lead significantly in 2020, averaging 58.1%. These three counties also saw some of the biggest growth and demographic changes over the same period. Gwinnett is Georgia\u2019s second largest county by population size. In 2010, its population was 50.8% white, 31.3% black, 22.3% Latino and 13.8% Asian, according to Census Bureau data. But by 2020, the percentage of white residents dropped to 35.5% as its population added over 151,000 people. \u201cGeorgia is a growth state,\u201d Charles Bullock, a University of Georgia political science professor says. Job prospects are typically what draws the crowd, he said.\n\nBrandon Drenon/BBC Golf carts are common means of transportation in Peachtree City. Roughly 11,000 golf carts are registered with the city\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not voting anymore\u2019\n\nIn Peachtree City, an idyllic suburb in the Republican stronghold of Fayette County, 100 miles of paved \u201cmulti-use\u201d pathways \u2013 dominated by golf carts \u2013 wind between the city\u2019s lakes and tall lush green trees. Amid the picturesque landscape here, south-west of Atlanta, signs of a changing demographic hang from flyers in the local library. Brochures printed in dual languages offer everything from free English classes to \u201clinguistically diverse caregivers\u201d. Buzzing by the library on a Monday afternoon in her golf cart was Alyona Clement, a 32-year-old from Kazakhstan who last voted for Trump in 2016. \u201cI\u2019m not voting anymore,\" she said. She has been in Georgia since arriving to the US in 2005, but moved to Peachtree City with her husband and five children in 2020. \u201cAll the lawsuits that Trump is going through, all these women accusing him of stuff, that\u2019s what turned me off from him,\u201d Ms Clement said, referring to Trump\u2019s legal troubles. In May, Donald Trump became the first US president convicted of a felony for business fraud charges in New York. He\u2019s facing three other criminal cases, including election fraud charges in Georgia. His mugshot was taken in this state. Ms Clement is also not considering President Biden, because of his age and \u201chow crazy prices are\u201d. There are also voters like Alex Smith, a Fayette County transplant who voted for Joe Biden in 2020, but wasn\u2019t living in Georgia at the time. He plans to vote for the president again. \u201cBiden\u2019s age is an issue, but Trump is just as old,\u201d Mr Smith said, with his three-month-old child strapped to his chest and another running around the Peachtree City playground. Mr Smith said he likes Mr Biden\u2019s policies and has benefited from the president\u2019s student loan interest reduction programme. Voters like Ms Clement and Mr Smith will likely undermine the Republican hold on Fayette County, where Trump\u2019s margin of victory decreased by nearly six points in the last election. Democrats hope gains in areas like this will help to offset declining support for Mr Biden elsewhere in the state. \u201cFayette will be the next county to flip [to Democrats],\u201d Prof Bullock said.\n\nBrandon Drenon/BBC A large crowd was gathered on the final day of Atlanta's Juneteenth celebration on Sunday\n\nBut pollsters and strategists say that for the Biden campaign, there's no escaping the fact that black voters propelled the president to victory in Georgia in 2020, and there are real questions about whether they will do so again. A New York Times and Siena College poll found that in six swing states, including Georgia, 71% of black voters would back Mr Biden in 2024 - a steep drop from the 92% nationally that helped him win the White House at the last election. Underlying the decline is a generational divide among black voters, with young voters showing less support for Mr Biden than their elders. At the Piedmont Park Juneteenth celebration, Khalil Robertson, 30, was pushing his child uphill in a stroller. \u201cI probably won\u2019t vote for either candidate,\u201d he said, pausing under a tree to wipe sweat from his brow. \u201cBiden is selling the country and Trump brings out the racists.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the worst of two evils.\u201d",

        "text": "Justice Department to Recover Over $100 Million in Additional Funds Linked to 1MDB Scheme\nThe Justice Department announced today that it has reached an agreement with Low Taek Jho, also known as Jho Low, members of his family, and trust entities Low established (collectively, the \u201cLow Parties\u201d) that resolves two civil forfeiture cases.\n\nThe department previously brought the cases against assets that it alleges were acquired by Low and his family using funds allegedly embezzled from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), Malaysia\u2019s sovereign investment development fund. The Low Parties have also agreed to cooperate in the transfer to Malaysia of certain other assets located in Hong Kong, Switzerland, and Singapore that are linked to 1MDB funds. Under the agreement, the department will coordinate with foreign partners to facilitate the liquidation and return of these assets to Malaysia.\n\nAccording to the civil forfeiture complaints, from 2009 through 2015, more than $4.5 billion in funds belonging to 1MDB were allegedly misappropriated by high-level officials of 1MDB and their associates, including Low, through a criminal conspiracy involving international money laundering and bribery. 1MDB was created by the government of Malaysia to promote economic development in Malaysia through global partnerships and foreign direct investment. Its funds were intended to be used to improve the well-being of the Malaysian people.\n\nThe agreement resolves the civil forfeiture action against a luxury apartment in Paris and artwork located in Switzerland by artists Andy Warhol and Claude Monet, which Low purchased for approximately $35 million in total. In addition, parties agreed to return to Malaysia real property and cash in bank accounts valued at approximately $67 million located in Hong Kong, Switzerland, and Singapore. The United States will release a total of $3.5 million to the trust entities to pay for legal fees and costs associated with the properties. Under the agreement, none of these fees may be returned to Low or his family members.\n\nPrior to this settlement, in total, the United States has returned or assisted in the return to Malaysia of over $1.4 billion in assets associated with the international money laundering, embezzlement, and bribery scheme.\n\nLow separately faces charges in the Eastern District of New York for allegedly conspiring to launder billions of dollars embezzled from 1MDB and for conspiring to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by allegedly paying bribes to various Malaysian and Emirati officials, and in the District of Columbia for allegedly conspiring to make and conceal foreign and conduit campaign contributions during the United States presidential election in 2012. This agreement does not release any entity or individual from filed or potential criminal charges.\n\nThe FBI\u2019s International Corruption Squads in New York City and Los Angeles and IRS Criminal Investigation are investigating the case.\n\nTrial Attorneys Barbara Levy, Sean Fern, Jonathan Baum, and Joshua Sohn of the Criminal Division\u2019s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS) and Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Galatzan for the Central District of California are prosecuting the case, with significant assistance from the Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs and MLARS\u2019 Program Management Staff.\n\nThe Justice Department also appreciates the significant assistance provided over the course of this investigation by the Attorney General\u2019s Chambers of Malaysia, the Royal Malaysia Police, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission, the Attorney-General\u2019s Chambers of Singapore, the Singapore Police Force-Commercial Affairs Department, the Office of the Attorney General and the Federal Office of Justice of Switzerland, and French authorities.\n\nThe Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative is led by a team of dedicated prosecutors in MLARS, in partnership with federal law enforcement agencies, and often with U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices, to forfeit the proceeds of foreign official corruption. Individuals with information about possible proceeds of foreign corruption located in or laundered through the United States should contact federal law enforcement or send an email to kleptocracy@usdoj.gov or https://tips.fbi.gov/.",

        "text": "Presidential debate fact check: What Trump, Biden got right (and wrong)\nPresident Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump both strayed repeatedly from the truth as they squared off in the first presidential debate of the 2024 election season.\n\nHere are the claims the USA TODAY Fact Check Team dug into.\n\nBiden claim: We lowered the cost of an insulin shot from $400 to $15\n\n\u201cWe brought down the price of prescription drugs, which is a major issue for many people, to $15 for \u2013 for an insulin shot, as opposed to $400.\u201d\n\nThis is false. The Inflation Reduction Act that Biden signed into law in August 2022 capped the out-of-pocket cost of insulin at $35 a month for all seniors on Medicare, according to the White House. Several pharmaceutical companies, including Eli Lilly, followed suit and limited the monthly cost of the drug to $35 per month as well. But there is no evidence Biden limited the cost of insulin beyond this.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nThe price of insulin was also never set at $400, though many paid about this much. The price a person pays for insulin depends on a variety of factors, including what type of insulin they are using, insurance status and whether they're eligible for a rebate from the drugmaker, according to NBC News. While estimates vary, one government study published in December 2022 reported that in 2019, the average insulin user with private insurance spent $456 on insulin annually, while those with Medicare spent $449 a year and those without health insurance paid $996, comparatively.\n\n-Brad Sylvester\n\nBiden claim: He is endorsed by Border Patrol agents\n\n\u201cThe border patrolmen endorsed me, endorsed my position.\u201d\n\nThis is partly false.\n\nThe National Border Patrol Council \u2013 the labor union that represents more than 18,000 U.S. Border Patrol agents \u2013 posted to X, formerly Twitter, minutes after Biden made the claim and said, \u201cTo be clear, we never have and never will endorse Biden.\u201d\n\nBut the union, which endorsed Trump in 2020, supported the proposed bipartisan border agreement that Biden backed and Trump opposed, NBC News reported in February.\n\n\u2013 Joedy McCreary\n\nBiden claim: Illegal border crossings dropped 40% after his June directive\n\n\u201cI've changed (the law) in a way that now you're in a situation where there are 40% fewer people coming across the border illegally.\u201d\n\nBiden took executive action on June 4 that authorized the U.S. to turn away migrants who enter the country illegally when crossing levels are high. The policy is triggered anytime unlawful crossings hit an average of 2,500 people a day in a given week.\n\nIn remarks posted on June 26, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro N. Mayorkas said Border Patrol encounters along the U.S.-Mexico border had dropped by over 40% since Biden took action.\n\nHowever, immigration experts have cautioned that it\u2019s difficult to point to any one reason for a drop in crossings at the border, PolitiFact noted in its fact check on this claim.\n\nImmigration rights organizations have sued the Biden administration over the new asylum restrictions at the border.\n\n\u2013Andre Byik\n\nTrump claim: Everybody wanted Roe v. Wade overturned\n\n\u201cI put three great Supreme Court justices on the court, and they happened to vote in favor of killing Roe v. Wade and moving it back to the states. This is something that everybody wanted.\u201d\n\nThis is not an accurate summary of public opinion on the question. Numerous polls show most Americans were not in favor of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade in June 2022. For example, a poll conducted by Pew Research Center in July 2022 found that 57% of respondents said they disapproved of the overturning of the landmark decision. Another PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll conducted in May 2022 (before the case was decided) found that 64% of respondents were opposed to reversing Roe v. Wade.\n\nThere is little evidence opinions have changed much since the decision. A Marquette Law School poll conducted in February 2024 found that 67% of adults opposed the ruling, while a Gallup poll from June 2023 found that 60% of respondents said overturning Roe v. Wade was a \u201cbad thing.\u201d\n\n-Brad Sylvester\n\nBiden claim: Historians voted Trump \u2018worst\u2019 president in history\n\n\u201c(Trump) was the worst in all of American history. \u2026 He can argue (the historians) are wrong, but that\u2019s what they voted.\u201d\n\nBiden was presumably referring to the 2024 Presidential Greatness Project Expert Survey, which is a joint project from University of Houston professor Brandon Rottinghaus and Coastal Carolina University professor Justin Vaughn.\n\nThe survey respondents in late 2023 voted Trump the lowest in \u201coverall presidential greatness,\u201d behind James Buchanan, Andrew Johnson and Franklin Pierce. Abraham Lincoln was rated highest. Joe Biden ranked at No. 14.\n\nRespondents included scholars who had recently published peer-reviewed academic research in related scholarly journals or academic presses and current and recent members of the Presidents & Executive Politics Section of the American Political Science Association, which the survey described as \u201cthe foremost organization of social science experts in presidential politics.\u201d\n\nOut of 525 respondents invited to participate, the survey received 154 usable responses, yielding a 29% response rate.\n\n\u2013Andre Byik\n\nTrump claim: I brought in National Guard during 2020 Minnesota unrest\n\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t bring in the National Guard, that city (Minneapolis) would have been destroyed.\u201d\n\nIt was Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, who activated the state\u2019s National Guard to respond to unrest following the death of George Floyd, according to a press release issued by Walz\u2019s office on May 28, 2020.\n\nWalz said at the time that he was responding to \u201clocal leaders\u2019 request for Minnesota National Guard assistance to protect peaceful demonstrators, neighbors and small businesses in Minnesota.\u201d\n\nCNN reporter Daniel Dale also looked into the claim back in 2020, detailing the timeline of events provided to the network by Walz\u2019s press secretary, Teddy Tschann. In a statement to CNN, Tschann said Walz activated the National Guard at the request of the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul, before the governor spoke with the White House.\n\n\u201cDid President Trump \u2018call out\u2019 the Guard? No,\u201d Tschann said in the statement, according to CNN.\n\nOn May 30, 2020, the Minnesota National Guard posted on Twitter, now X, that Walz had \u201cannounced the full mobilization\u201d of the Guard for the first time since World War II.\n\n\u2013Andre Byik\n\nBiden claim: Trump praised Hitler, saying he did 'some good things'\n\n\"This is a guy who says Hitler has done some good things\"\n\nBiden's quote of Trump is a reference to comments the former president allegedly made while talking with his White House Chief of Staff, John Kelly, in 2018 during a trip to Paris, according to excerpts from an upcoming book by Wall Street Journal reporter Michael Bender.\n\n\u201cWell, Hitler did a lot of good things,\u201d Trump reportedly told Kelly, according to a CNN report.\n\nTrump later denied that he made the comments and denied that the conversation took place. Liz Harrington, a Trump spokesperson, told CNN the claim is \"totally false.\"\n\n\"President Trump never said this,\" Harrington said. \"It is made up fake news, probably by a general who was incompetent and was fired.\"\n\nTrump has previously faced criticism for saying immigrants are \u201cpoisoning the blood of our country\u201d and describing his political opponents as \"vermin,\" reminding many of language used by authoritarian leaders.\n\n- Chris Mueller\n\nTrump claim: Record \u2018approval rating\u2019 from VA\n\n\u201cI had the highest approval rating in the history of the VA.\u201d\n\nThis is both false and a mischaracterization of what the quarterly customer experience surveys from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs measure.\n\nThe Veteran Signals surveys track the proportion of servicemembers who express having trust in the VA. It's not a presidential approval rating.\n\nIt has topped 80% twice: It was at 80% in 2020 during Trump\u2019s administration, and it reached a high of 80.4% in May under Biden.\n\nTrump made a similar version of the claim during a May rally in Wisconsin, according to a report from Wisconsin Watch.\n\n\u2013 Joedy McCreary\n\nTrump claim: More illicit drugs coming into US under Biden\n\n\u201cThe number of drugs coming across our border now is the largest we\u2019ve ever had by far.\u201d\n\nThis is false. When measured by weight, drug seizures are trending down.\n\nThe U.S. Customs and Border Protection\u2019s Border Patrol and Office of Field Operations seized nearly 549,000 pounds of illicit drugs in 2023, according to federal data. That\u2019s down 16% from 2022, when 656,000 pounds of substances were confiscated. More than 900,000 pounds were seized in 2021, according to federal data.\n\nMost of the drugs involved were marijuana (150,000 pounds) and methamphetamine (140,000 pounds).\n\nFentanyl seizures were up, however, with the 27,000 pounds in 2023 accounting for nearly twice the 14,700 pounds confiscated in 2022.\n\n\u2013 Joedy McCreary\n\nTrump claim: Biden indicted me because I\u2019m his political opponent\n\n\u201cHe [Biden] indicted me because I'm his opponent.\u201d\n\nThis is false. Trump was indicted and convicted in New York for falsifying business records related to a $130,000 hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election. But there is no evidence Biden or his administration had anything to do with these charges. Since the charges were brought by the state of New York, Biden and the federal government are not party to the indictment and have no say in the charges, as USA TODAY previously reported.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with state prosecutions, it\u2019s district attorneys elected by the voters of their jurisdiction,\u201d said Allan Lichtman, a professor of history at American University. \u201cThat has nothing to do with the federal government.\u201d\n\nThe idea of Biden interfering in Trump's prosecution is further weakened by the fact that the agency under his purview declined to file charges. The Justice Department had the authority to pursue a case against Trump over the hush money circumstances but chose not to do so.\n\nIn Trump's two federal cases, things are a bit different. The charges he faces cover the hoarding of hundreds of classified documents in Florida and a conspiracy to steal the 2020 election from Biden in Washington.\n\nThere is no law that prohibits a president from involving himself in a federal case, experts acknowledged. But they also said Biden has kept himself separate from the prosecution of Trump.\n\nAdditionally, Biden publicly vowed not to speak to Attorney General Merrick Garland about any specific case. And a key reason for the November 2022 appointment of Jack Smith as special counsel for the federal cases against Trump was to add a layer of separation between the investigation and the Biden Administration.\n\n-Brad Sylvester and Joedy McCreary\n\nTrump claim: Food prices have 'doubled and tripled and quadrupled' under Biden\n\n\"You look at the cost of food where it's doubled and tripled and quadrupled.\"\n\nThe cost of food has gone up under Biden, but not to the extent Trump claimed.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture's all-food consumer price index shows food prices rose by 25% from 2019 to 2023.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused changes in consumer behavior and led to supply chain disruptions, driving large increases in some foods. In 2022, food costs increased faster than any year since 1979, \"partly due to a highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak that affected egg and poultry prices,\" according to the department's report.\n\nBut grocery prices have stabilized over the last year, increasing by just 1.2% in the past 12 months, according to the Consumer Price Index report from March 2024.\n\n- Chris Mueller\n\nTrump claim: No sex with porn star\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have sex with a porn star.\u201d\n\nThis is disputed.\n\nOn May 30, a New York state jury found Trump guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records tied to a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels. Daniels testified at trial that she had sex with Trump in July 2006 following a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe.\n\nTrump has denied the sex happened.\n\nThe trial focused on a $130,000 payment that was arranged by Trump\u2019s then-personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, ahead of the 2016 presidential election, the Associated Press reported.\n\n\u2013Andre Byik\n\nTrump claim: Biden called African Americans \u2018super predators\u2019\n\n\"He did a crime bill. 1994. Where you called them super predators. African Americans. Super predators. And they've never forgotten it. They've never forgotten it.\"\n\nWhile Biden once warned of \u201cpredators\u201d in 1993 while advocating for a 1994 crime bill he sponsored as a senator, he never referred to African Americans as \u201csuper predators.\u201d Rather, it was then-first lady Hillary Clinton who linked that term to the 1994 crime bill, as USA TODAY previously reported\n\nWhile campaigning for her husband in 1996, Clinton praised the 1994 crime bill for curbing gangs, saying, \"We need to take these people on, they are often connected to big drug cartels, they are not just gangs of kids anymore. They are often the kinds of kids that are called super predators. No conscious, no empathy,\"\n\nNotably, she did not connect this comment to Black people.\n\n-Brad Sylvester\n\nTrump claim: Unprecedented numbers of murders by immigrants under Biden\n\n\u201cPeople are coming in and they\u2019re killing our citizens at a level that we\u2019ve never seen.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump has made a version of this claim before, there is no data that points to a wave of homicides being led by people living illegally in the U.S.\n\nA review of 2024 crime data by NBC News suggests the opposite might be true. Overall crime levels have fallen in cities where a Texas program has transported migrants from the border, the network reported in February.\n\nCrime is down year over year in Philadelphia, Chicago, Denver, New York and Los Angeles, according to the report. Washington experienced an increase, but officials do not attribute that spike to migrants, NBC News reported.\n\nTrump previously made a version of the claim during a speech in Eagle Pass, Texas.\n\nResearch suggests immigrants actually commit fewer crimes than people born in the U.S.\n\n\u2013 Joedy McCreary\n\nTrump claim: The US southern border is the most dangerous place in the world\n\n\u201cWe have a border that's the most dangerous place anywhere in the world\u201d\n\nThis is false. While deaths, disappearances and violence do occur at the U.S. southern border, there is no evidence to suggest it is the most dangerous place in the world.\n\nStatistics on border deaths vary. Customs and Border Protection data shows 171 people died at the border in fiscal year 2022, some in CBP custody and others while attempting to cross the border. The International Organization for Migration, a U.N.-related organization, documented 686 deaths and disappearances of migrants on the US-Mexico border in 2022.\n\nPlaces all over the world and even in the U.S. have more frequent deaths. For example, there were more than 700 murders in Chicago in 2022, according to the Chicago Police Department. Chicago is 228 square miles, while the U.S.-Mexico border is 1,951 miles long.\n\n-Brad Sylvester\n\nTrump claim: Corporate tax cut from 39% to 21%\n\n\u201cThe corporate tax was cut down to 21% from 39% plus beyond that.\u201d\n\nTrump was off with one of his numbers.\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 did lower the corporate tax rate to 21%. But it started at 35%, not the 39% that Trump claimed.\n\nIt is unclear exactly what Trump meant with his reference to \u201cplus beyond that.\u201d He promised business leaders that he would lower the corporate tax rate to 20%, The New York Times reported June 13.\n\n\u2013 Joedy McCreary\n\nBiden claim: Trump told Americans to inject bleach to treat COVID-19\n\n\"He said it\u2019s not that serious, just inject a little bleach in your arm, you\u2019ll be all right.\"\n\nBiden is referring to comments Trump made during a press conference early in the pandemic when he suggested disinfectants might be a possible treatment for COVID-19. But he overstates what Trump said.\n\nTrump's statement came after Bill Bryan, an undersecretary of science and technology at the Department of Homeland Security, discussed a new study that found sunlight and household disinfectants effectively killed the virus on surfaces or in the air.\n\n\"And then I saw the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in one minute, and is there a way we could do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump, though, never directly instructed people to inject bleach or any other disinfectant. Some states issued warnings following Trump's comment, as did Lysol, which told people not to inject or ingest its products as a coronavirus treatment.\n\n- Chris Mueller\n\nBiden claim: No American troops died anywhere in the world during his presidency\n\n\u201cThe truth is, I\u2019m the only president this century that doesn\u2019t have any - this decade - that doesn\u2019t have any troops dying anywhere in the world, like (former President Donald Trump) did.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s comment came following a reference to hostilities in Afghanistan during Trump\u2019s term in office.\n\nBut the notion that no troops have died in the world during Biden\u2019s time in office is wrong.\n\nThirteen U.S. service members were killed in a suicide bombing attack near the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul in August 2021, when Biden was president, as thousands tried to flee the Taliban\u2019s takeover of the country, USA TODAY previously reported.\n\nAmong the deaths were 11 Marines, one Navy hospital corpsman and one Army soldier.\n\nBiden remarked on the deaths at the time, calling them \u201ctragic.\u201d\n\nMore recently, three U.S. Army Reserve soldiers were killed in January at a base in Jordan in what was described as a drone attack by Iran-backed militants.\n\n\u2013Andre Byik\n\nDebate background: Hunter Biden's ongoing legal troubles sure to hang over campaign\n\nIn early June, a jury found Hunter Biden \u2013 Joe Biden's son \u2013 guilty of three federal gun charges, making him the first child of a sitting president to be convicted at trial. The situation has been politically charged as it coincides with the elder Biden's ongoing campaign for reelection.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have investigated Hunter Biden's foreign business deals, repeatedly alleging that Joe Biden was involved in influence peddling during his time as vice president. The White House has denied that allegation, calling it baseless innuendo.\n\nJoe Biden, who earlier said he wouldn't pardon his son, released a statement shortly after the jury's verdict was announced reiterating that position.\n\n\u201cI will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal,\u201d he said. \u201cJill and I will always be there for Hunter and the rest of our family with our love and support. Nothing will ever change that.\u201d\n\nHunter Biden is expected to stand trial again in September in California, where he faces tax charges.\n\nBut even before his legal troubles, the president's son has been a frequent target for misinformation. Here are some of the claims we've already debunked:\n\n- Chris Mueller\n\nDebate background: Vast differences between Biden, Trump on gender identity, LGBTQ+ issues\n\nWith Pride Month winding down, LGBTQ+ issues \u2013 specifically, those related to gender identity \u2013 remain pivotal for voters in both parties.\n\nThe candidates have taken widely different positions on those issues, with President Joe Biden \u2013 hailed as the most LGBTQ-friendly president in U.S. history \u2013 marking his first day in office with an executive order on LGBTQ rights.\n\nHis administration is challenging Tennessee\u2019s ban on gender-affirming care for minors, with the Supreme Court agreeing to hear the case. He also unveiled in April a set of sweeping changes to Title IX rules that protect LGBTQ+ students from discrimination based on their gender identity, but a federal judge blocked their enforcement in four states.\n\nMeanwhile, former President Donald Trump vowed in May to roll back transgender student protections \u201con Day 1\u201d of his presidency by reversing an executive order issued by Biden in 2021. Trump also vowed in February 2023 to punish medical professionals and facilities that provide gender-affirming care to transgender minors and said he would support banning transgender women from women\u2019s sports.\n\nHere are some of the false claims related to LGBTQ+ issues that we\u2019ve debunked:\n\n\u2013 Joedy McCreary\n\nDebate background: Israel\u2019s war against Hamas sparks unrest in US as peace deal remains elusive\n\nThe Hamas attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and Israel\u2019s bombardment of the Gaza Strip in response, plunged President Joe Biden into the second major international conflict of his term. He has been forced to balance America\u2019s military support for Israel with calls from the left to broker a ceasefire deal as casualties mount in the Palestinian territory.\n\nBiden said in May that it is \u201ctime for this war to end and for the day after to begin,\u201d laying out a proposal that called for Israel to cease military operations in the Gaza Strip and Hamas to release hostages in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.\n\nBut a peace deal has proved elusive, leading to unrest on college campuses across the country after pro-Palestinian demonstrators set up protest camps. Former President Donald Trump cheered police crackdowns on demonstrators, calling them \u201ca beautiful thing to watch.\u201d But he\u2019s also called on Israel to finish its war, saying the violence is hurting its standing among the international community.\n\n\u201cIsrael has to be very careful, because you're losing a lot of the world, you\u2019re losing a lot of support, you have to finish up, you have to get the job done,\u201d Trump told Israeli outlet Israel Hayom in an interview posted in March. \"And you have to get on to peace, to get on to a normal life for Israel, and for everybody else.\u201d\n\nThese are some claims related to the Israel-Hamas war that we\u2019ve already addressed:\n\n\u2013 Andre Byik\n\nDebate background: Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine puts spotlight on US involvement in foreign wars\n\nRussia\u2019s war against Ukraine entered its third year in February, and the conflict has had political implications in the U.S., where pushes to approve war aid for Ukraine have been met with contentious debate over the extent of American involvement in foreign wars, the Associated Press reported.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has remained committed to supporting Ukraine and its effort to join NATO, signing a 10-year bilateral security agreement with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on June 13.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to strengthen Ukraine\u2019s credible defense and deterrence capabilities for the long term,\u201d Biden said at a press conference about the agreement. \u201cA lasting peace for Ukraine must be underwritten by Ukraine\u2019s own ability to defend itself now and to deter future aggression anytime \u2026 in the future.\u201d\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has said he could end the war within 24 hours of returning to the Oval Office, but he\u2019s offered few details about his plan. The Washington Post reported Trump\u2019s plan could include pressuring Ukraine to give up territory, which Ukraine has opposed.\n\nHere are some fact-checks about claims related to the war in Ukraine:\n\n\u2013 Andre Byik\n\nDebate background: Fight over immigration reform plays out during presidential campaign\n\nImmigration has become one of the most heated topics of the 2024 election, as President Joe Biden grapples with high levels of crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border and former President Donald Trump vows to deport millions of migrants if re-elected.\n\nThe situation at the Southwest border \u2013 where U.S. Customs and Border Protection recorded nearly 2.5 million migrant encounters in fiscal 2023 \u2013 prompted Biden to take executive action earlier this month to implement new restrictions on asylum access.\n\nThe action came after Republican lawmakers in February blocked an immigration bill blocked by Biden that would have revamped the country\u2019s immigration and border policies.\n\nBiden blamed the legislation\u2019s failure to gain traction in Congress on opposition from Trump.\n\n\u201cNow, all indications are this bill won't even move forward to the Senate floor,\u201d Biden said at the time. \u201cWhy? A simple reason. Donald Trump. Because Donald Trump thinks it's bad for him politically.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has pledged to reinstate policies from his first term in office and limit asylum access if elected in November. He also wants to institute a merit-based immigration system and deputize the National Guard and local law enforcement \u201cto assist with rapidly removing illegal alien gang members and criminals,\u201d according to his campaign website.\n\nHere are some immigration-related claims we previously debunked:\n\n\u2013 Andre Byik\n\nDebate background: Biden and Trump face age-related concerns, though both insist they're fit to serve\n\nAt 81 years old, Joe Biden is currently the oldest U.S. president ever elected. His age has been a concern for voters and a frequent target for critics, including Donald Trump, who often suggests Biden's age makes him unfit to be president.\n\nTrump is 78 years old, three years younger than Biden, but he has also faced criticism related to his age and mental acuity, including when he confused Joe Biden for Barack Obama in multiple campaign speeches.\n\nEither man would be the oldest person to take the oath of office if sworn in next January.\n\nIn February, Justice Department special counsel Robert Hur released a report indicating Biden wouldn't face charges for his handling of classified documents that included multiple comments about Biden's age and memory, describing him as an elderly man with \"diminished capacities,\" including memory loss. However, Biden and his administration pushed back, with Biden saying his \"memory is fine\" during a televised speech.\n\nWhile Trump's doctor said multiple times he was healthy during his presidency, there were \u2013 and still are \u2013 reports of him slurring words during his speeches. Late in his term, Trump was recorded slowly descending a ramp after a speech at at U.S. Military Academy at West Point, during which he used both hands to drink a glass of water. Trump dismissed concerns raised about his age after that incident, claiming the ramp was long, steep and \"very slippery.\"\n\nHere are a few of the age-related claims we've already addressed:\n\n- Chris Mueller\n\nDebate background: Election integrity remains key issue \u2013 even without evidence of widespread voter fraud\n\nThroughout the campaign one question has persisted: Will the candidates and their supporters trust \u2013 and abide by \u2013 the results of the election?\n\nMost recently, former President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign and the Republican National Committee led by his daughter-in-law said they will mobilize 100,000 people in battleground states to ensure \u201ctransparency and fairness.\u201d The move has drawn criticism from opponents who say it has the potential to lead to voter intimidation.\n\nState-level recounts, reviews and audits of the 2022 midterm elections found no indication of systemic problems with voter fraud. That\u2019s significant because baseless allegations from Trump and his allies have penetrated the Republican Party and eroded confidence in the process.\n\nClaims questioning the integrity of the election frequently center around a handful of predictable themes that include assertions of widespread voter fraud and election \u201chacking.\u201d\n\nUSA TODAY has debunked several false claims about the integrity of the elections:\n\n\u2013 Joedy McCreary\n\nDebate background: Trump\u2019s conviction, pending trials loom over debate, election\n\nThe first former U.S. president convicted of a felony will take the debate stage as an ex-president for the first time in an attempt to convince voters to give him his old job back.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump\u2019s felony conviction and his three pending criminal trials continue to loom large over both the race and the debate \u2013 his first of the presidential election cycle \u2013 with President Joe Biden.\n\nTrump was convicted of 34 counts of falsifying business records related to hush-money payments intended to silence two women, including adult film actress Stormy Daniels, before the 2016 election. Days before the debate, the judge in that case lifted the gag order restrictions that protected the witnesses and jurors. He is scheduled to be sentenced July 11 \u2013 days before the start of the Republican National Convention, during which he is expected to formally receive the party\u2019s nomination.\n\nTrump also faces charges for allegedly mishandling classified documents and allegedly conspiring to steal the 2020 presidential election, including his role in the Jan. 6 insurrection. Trump and several allies were indicted in August by a Georgia grand jury that accused them of trying to overturn his 2020 election loss in the state, where Trump lost to President Joe Biden by about 12,000 votes.\n\nTrump\u2019s legal problems have been the subject of an array of false or misleading claims on social media:\n\n\u2013 Joedy McCreary\n\nMore from the Fact-Check Team: How we pick and research claims | Email newsletter | Facebook page\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

        "text": "NATO is on the ballot in 2024\nThese two provisions mean that if there is an attack on any of these countries, from Turkey and Estonia to France and Canada, the United States and all its other NATO allies are expected to fight as if they themselves had been attacked.\n\nArticle 10 opens the NATO membership door to any European country that upholds the principles of the alliance and can contribute to its security. The open door allowed for NATO\u2019s expansion to Greece and Turkey in 1952, West Germany in 1955, and Spain in 1982. From 1999-2020, 14 Central and Eastern European nations joined NATO. And in the past two years, Finland and Sweden became NATO\u2019s 31st and 32nd members.\n\nFor member countries, NATO is a broad, substantial, and high-stakes commitment, as reflected in its two key provisions, Article 5 and Article 10 . Article 5 proclaims that an \u201carmed attack\u201d against one member of the alliance will be treated as an attack on all of them. Given that a nuclear-armed Soviet Union was the motivating threat behind the alliance, Article 5 has always carried with it the risk of escalation to nuclear war. In practice, Article 5 has only been invoked once: On September 12, 2001, the North Atlantic Council met and announced that it would invoke Article 5 to demonstrate solidarity with the United States after the terrorist attacks on U.S. soil the day before.\n\nAfter 75 years, NATO can seem like a piece of old furniture: For some, it feels like it has always been there, and getting rid of it would be unthinkable, while for others, it is hopelessly outdated. Founded in 1949, NATO was designed to prevent another European war in the shadow of the Soviet Union\u2019s conquest of Eastern Europe after World War II. The first secretary general of NATO reportedly said that the alliance\u2019s purpose was \u201cto keep the Americans in, the Russians out, and the Germans down.\u201d\n\nHowever, the congressional move does not necessarily protect NATO from a potential second Trump term. Even if he is prevented by law from formally withdrawing the United States from NATO, Trump could use his presidential power to severely undermine the alliance and withdraw U.S. support for it in all but name. Although there has been significant debate over whether the United States should maintain its commitment to a Cold War-era alliance, it is natural for allies to expect any reduction or wind-down of the U.S. commitment to be congressionally sanctioned. Yet Trump\u2019s long-standing and stark views on NATO and his history of abrupt action as president mean that a second Trump term could be a potential earthquake for the alliance.\n\nIn response to Trump\u2019s threats, the U.S. House and Senate included a provision in last year\u2019s National Defense Authorization Act that prohibits a president from withdrawing the United States from NATO without approval from a two-thirds majority in the Senate or a separate act of Congress.\n\nThe Republican Party\u2019s presumptive nominee, former President Donald Trump, has consistently sent mixed signals about his commitment to collective defense and privately mused that he might withdraw the United States from the alliance. Such a move would be a total reversal after four years of President Joe Biden bolstering NATO, including its expansion to include Finland and Sweden in the wake of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBut it is the 2024 U.S. presidential election that poses a unique threat to NATO. While European member countries continue to play frontline roles in the alliance and are focused on increasing defense needs in the wake of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the unavoidable reality is that the United States remains the bedrock of NATO\u2019s ability to deter external attacks. And in 2024, the two presidential candidates hold starkly different views about the alliance\u2019s future.\n\nThe second half of 2024 is shaping up to be an anxious time for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the U.S.-led alliance bloc that comprises 32 member states across North America and Europe and exists to help protect each other from external threats. The Russian military continues to ravage Ukraine and menace the alliance\u2019s doorstep, while Russia is already fighting a kind of hybrid war against member states. Meanwhile, domestic political challenges are mounting on both sides of the Atlantic. In Europe, far-right parties appear to be gaining strength, so much so in France that President Emmanuel Macron called early parliamentary elections. Marine Le Pen, the leader of France\u2019s far-right National Rally, has advocated for taking French troops out of the U.S.-led NATO integrated command and for a rapprochement between NATO and Russia, whose president, Vladimir Putin, she has openly praised in the past.\n\nNATO has faced political challenges since its founding\n\nIt is easy to forget that NATO faced political headwinds from its inception. Moscow\u2019s backing for a communist coup in Czechoslovakia in February 1948, followed by a Soviet blockade of West Berlin, convinced President Harry Truman to form a tight bond across the Atlantic. Through NATO, Truman sought to prevent another European war that might draw in the United States, keep the North Atlantic community secure and prosperous through free trade, and maintain the emerging postwar international order (which ultimately reinforced U.S. dominance on the world stage).\n\nBut after decades at or on the brink of war in Europe, U.S. politicians and the broader U.S. public were decidedly lukewarm about an open-ended commitment to fight on behalf of other countries. Because NATO is a treaty-based organization, Truman could not constitutionally commit the United States to join the alliance without approval from two-thirds of the U.S. Senate. Truman needed help from the internationalist wing of a divided Republican Party to get the treaty ratified in 1949. Support for international institutions like the United Nations and NATO remained an issue within the GOP, however. It was an issue in the race for the 1952 Republican presidential nomination, between the alliance skepticism of the conservative Robert Taft and the internationalist outlook of NATO\u2019s first supreme commander, Dwight Eisenhower. Eisenhower won the nomination and ultimately the presidency, cementing U.S. support for NATO as a bipartisan endeavor.\n\nHowever, the victory of the internationalist U.S. political outlook did not end NATO\u2019s internal challenges, which persisted throughout the Cold War. Given the United States\u2019 dramatically larger military and logistical capabilities, the Article 5 collective defense provision has always depended in practice on the credibility of the U.S. commitment to NATO. But the outsized American role in NATO has also led to tensions. NATO members in Europe make indispensable and significant military contributions to the alliance\u2014including troops, bases, infrastructure, specialized capabilities, and crucially, the acceptance of geopolitical risk given their proximity to the Soviet Union during the Cold War and Russia today. At times, European countries chafed under American dominance of NATO\u2019s integrated command, wanting more control over the security capabilities that affect their populations so directly.\n\nEven as they maintained this dominance, U.S. presidents have protested since NATO\u2019s founding that European members do not spend enough for the collective defense. Eisenhower complained, and so did John F. Kennedy. Barack Obama criticized \u201cfree riders.\u201d Donald Trump came into office in January 2017 believing that America\u2019s allies had long taken advantage of the United States to keep them secure. In 2014, the NATO allies set a target of spending 2% of GDP on defense by 2024. While more and more members are meeting that goal (23 as of this year), a number of them still fall short. (Stoltenberg noted in February 2024 that for the first time, NATO\u2019s European members will collectively spend 2% of their combined GDP on defense compared to just 1.47% of their combined GDP 10 years ago.)\n\nStill, NATO not only survived its Cold War internal challenges but also the geopolitical challenge of the end of the Cold War itself. Despite the many subsequent changes in the international security and economic environments, presidents\u2014including Trump\u2014have maintained the U.S. commitment to NATO. And despite the Republican Party\u2019s dramatically increased isolationism and warmer attitudes toward Russia\u2014thanks largely to Trump\u2014congressional support for NATO remains strong, as illustrated by the overwhelming vote to admit Finland and Sweden, with 95 senators voting in favor.\n\nWhy NATO endures\n\nNATO\u2019s staying power is a break with U.S. foreign policy tradition. In his Farewell Address in 1796, President George Washington urged his fellow Americans to avoid \u201cpermanent alliances.\u201d Many commentators have argued that NATO has long outlived its usefulness and that Europeans are overly reliant on a United States that is itself too quick to reach for military tools in general.\n\nWhy has this commitment not only endured but also expanded? In the United States, NATO appeals to different groups for different reasons, giving it significant support in different corners of Congress. Some see NATO as part of the liberal international order that protects the norms and values of democracies\u2014and indeed, Biden has framed NATO as an alliance of democracies confronting the authoritarian threat from Putin\u2019s Russia and a rising China. Others take a more realist view, noting the substantial capabilities NATO member countries bring to the alliance (an argument Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell stressed in support of Finnish and Swedish accession). NATO supporters also point to the need to protect Europe as a major U.S. trading partner against Russia and China\u2019s economic threats.\n\nElection 2024: Why this time could be different\n\nGiven America\u2019s pro-NATO constituency and Congress\u2019 role in the alliance from the beginning, could the next president of the United States withdraw the country from NATO despite last year\u2019s legislation requiring Congress to have a role in such a move?\n\nPresidents have become less and less constrained over time in the conduct of foreign policy. From World War II to the 1990s, Congress was a significant repository of foreign policy expertise; it is dramatically less so today. While congressional oversight and position-taking on foreign policy has always had a healthy dose of partisan and electoral politics, polarization has meant that opposition members of Congress reflexively oppose the White House. As a result, Congress conducts less oversight, bargains less frequently over policy, and is much less effective as a check on presidential authority.\n\nA president disposed to undermine NATO could take many diplomatic and military actions unilaterally that would harm\u2014perhaps even paralyze\u2014the alliance. At the diplomatic level, for example, the president could decide not to appoint an ambassador to NATO. Additionally, the president could decide not to send his secretaries of state and defense and other officials to meetings of NATO defense ministers and foreign ministers or working-level meetings where much of NATO\u2019s business gets done. Congress could haul administration officials in for questioning, but it has lost much of its inclination and capacity to conduct oversight of foreign policy in recent decades.\n\nThe president could take even more significant actions as commander in chief. For example, the president could withdraw U.S. military assets and military personnel, defanging the U.S. commitment even if it remained on the books. The president could decide not to appoint the supreme allied commander of NATO, who is based in Europe but historically has always been an American. And the president could determine (and declare) that if a NATO member state were attacked, the United States would not necessarily invoke or abide by its commitment to Article 5 to come to that country\u2019s aid. Indeed, Trump has already said as much on several occasions. Most recently, he said at a 2024 campaign rally that he would encourage the Russians to \u201cdo whatever the hell they want\u201d to NATO countries that do not meet their spending commitments.\n\nThis is not an exhaustive list. And even if an anti-NATO presidential effort is not entirely successful, such efforts might stir more intra-European uncertainty or antagonism, at a time when many European governments are facing domestic challenges from the far right.\n\nIn short, a president doesn\u2019t have to formally withdraw from NATO to undermine the alliance.\n\nNATO is on the ballot\n\nSince February 24, 2022, Biden has led the NATO response to support Ukraine in the face of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion and the largest land war in Europe since 1945. Although Trump-allied GOP members in the House of Representatives delayed funding for Ukraine in 2024, ultimately, bipartisan support for Ukraine prevailed. But there are serious doubts about whether Trump would continue that response if elected president, based on his past statements supporting Putin and questioning NATO.\n\nAdditionally, many internationalist Republican members of Congress are retiring or stepping down from leadership positions\u2014including McConnell, who is stepping down this fall as the Senate Republican leader. NATO does not seem at risk of losing significant congressional support, but the delayed Ukraine aid illustrated how few members it takes to hold up congressional action. Politically, NATO\u2019s path will not be smooth sailing even if Biden wins reelection.\n\nSo, while congressional legislation is an important sign of bipartisan support for NATO, if the president decides that American involvement in NATO no longer serves the country\u2019s interests, the alliance would have to somehow forge ahead without being able to rely on its most important member state. The current war in Ukraine has highlighted how dependent Europe still is on the United States for its national security. Even if the Europeans devoted more of their resources and energy to building stronger defense capabilities\u2014as presidents from both parties have long exhorted them to do\u2014it will take years if not decades to develop sufficient capacity.\n\nNATO\u2019s relevance and the degree and manner of burden-sharing remain worthy topics of debate. But the Trump-Biden 2024 rematch represents a distinct threat to the alliance given how much power the winner will have and how much Trump has learned about implementing his preferred policies since his first term. Although Congress has clearly expressed its view that the best way to keep the Russians out is to keep the Americans in, there may be little Congress can do if Trump opts for an abrupt, de facto U.S. exit from NATO.",

        "text": "Donald Trump and Joe Biden are preparing for the first 2024 presidential debate. Here's what to expect\nJoe Biden and Donald Trump are preparing to share a stage for the first time in four years.\n\nThe president and his predecessor will face off in an extraordinarily early election debate, more than four months before Americans vote on November 5.\n\nIf their history is any guide, it's likely to be tense and hostile, and \u2014 despite measures designed to keep things on track \u2014 could get chaotic.\n\nThis is how it will work\n\nThe debate is scheduled to kick off at 11am Friday, AEST \u2014 that's 9pm Thursday on America's east coast, and 6pm on the west coast.\n\nIt's the first of two debates Biden and Trump have agreed to. (The second is set for September.)\n\nIt'll be held in Atlanta, Georgia, at the headquarters of broadcaster CNN. Two of the network's big stars, Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, will moderate the debate. But there won't be a studio audience.\n\nJake Tapper and Dana Bash will ask the questions at CNN's HQ. (Reuters: Mike Segar)\n\nIt'll go for 90 minutes, with two ad breaks, CNN says.\n\nThe Biden and Trump camps have agreed on some rules\n\nThe candidates' podium positions have been decided by a toss of a coin: Trump will stand on the left of screen, Biden on the right.\n\nTheir microphones will be muted when it's not their turn to speak (to prevent the chaos that characterised the first debate in 2020).\n\nCampaign staff cannot interact with their candidates, even during the ad breaks.\n\nThe candidates are not allowed to bring notes (but they can write some down \u2014 they'll be provided with a pen and paper).\n\nProps are banned.\n\nBash and Tapper will ask the questions, but CNN says the debate \"is not the ideal arena for live fact-checking\" and the hosts will simply facilitate, rather than participate.\n\nThis hasn't always gone well\n\nBiden and Trump debated twice during the 2020 campaign. Nobody was too happy with how the first debate went.\n\nLoading...\n\nBiden was frustrated by how much he was interrupted by Trump. \"It's hard to get a word in with this clown,\" Biden complained at one point.\n\nTrump was angered when he was called out for his constant interjections by the moderator, Chris Wallace from Fox News. (Wallace has since moved to CNN.)\n\n\"I'm just sad with the way last night turned out,\" Wallace told the New York Times the next day. \"I never dreamt that it would go off the tracks the way it did.\"\n\nOrganisers brought in microphone-mute buttons for the next debate \u2014 but it was cancelled, because Trump had COVID.\n\nThe final debate in 2020 was more orderly than the first. There were still some personal attacks, but the candidates also discussed the campaign's big issues, including the pandemic, foreign adversaries, race relations and climate change.\n\nLoading...\n\nLongstanding tradition has been dumped\n\nSince 1988, America's presidential debates have been organised by the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD).\n\nBut not this time.\n\nThe CPD released a 2024 debate schedule last year, but the Biden campaign said he wouldn't be taking part.\n\nThey said the commission was \"out of step\", its audiences made for \"noisy spectacles\", and the debates needed to be earlier in the campaign. (Past debates have always been held in September and October, so this one will be the earliest ever.)\n\nAudiences have been present at past debates, such as this one between John McCain and Barack Obama in 2008. But not this time. (Reuters: Charles Dharapak)\n\nThe opposing campaigns instead negotiated directly with each other, and with CNN and America's ABC, and sidelined the commission for the first time in 35 years.\n\nCNN will allow other media organisations to broadcast its debate live, so multiple American channels and foreign networks will air it.\n\nThere have been some intense preparations\n\nBiden has spent much of the past week at his Camp David retreat. According to the New York Times, an aeroplane hangar and movie theatre have been \"outfitted with lights and production equipment to create a mock debate stage\".\n\nAt least 16 current and former aides have been involved in strategy sessions at the retreat. Lawyer Bob Bauer has role-played Trump in mock debates against Biden, as he did in 2020.\n\nThe candidate who won't be on the debate stage Photo shows A man in a suit speaks into a microphone. Robert F Kennedy Jr, the nephew of JFK, is a wildcard whose candidacy could determine who takes the White House.\n\nTrump was asked about his preparation strategy just before a campaign rally in Philadelphia at the weekend. \"This is really the best strategy right here,\" he said. \"We have all these people screaming questions.\"\n\nOn stage, he asked the Philadelphia crowd: \"How should I handle him? Should I be tough and nasty and just say, 'You're the worst president in history'? Or should I be nice and calm and let him speak?\"\n\nHe's been throwing some early blows, not only at Biden but also at CNN, a network he's long derided as \"fake news\".\n\nHe's already accusing Bash and Tapper of anti-Trump bias and framing the debate as \"three against one\".\n\nAnd a CNN host terminated an interview with one of his campaign spokespeople when she started making similar criticisms.\n\nThere's a lot to talk about\n\nBiden and Trump deeply dislike one another personally, and differ on almost every major policy position.\n\nAmerica's role on the world stage \u2014 including its involvement in Ukraine and Gaza \u2014 will feature heavily in the campaign to be commander-in-chief. Abortion and immigration are again shaping up to be major domestic issues. And many Americans will be looking for solutions to cost-of-living issues and concerning crime rates.\n\nBut a lot of the focus is likely to be on the men themselves. Trump frequently rails against Biden as the worst president in American history, and regularly questions the 81-year-old's mental fitness to hold office. (Trump turned 78 earlier this month.)\n\nBiden says Trump, with his retribution plans and attacks on the legal and electoral systems, represents a threat to democracy. Trump is also awaiting sentencing for falsifying business records to disguise a hush money payment, and has three other criminal trials pending.\n\nThe debate will be broadcast on the ABC News Channel, and ABC News will be live blogging the debate, including the lead-up and the aftermath, from Friday morning.",

        "text": "ChatGPT gave incorrect answers to questions about how to vote in battleground states\nA CBS News investigation found ChatGPT gave incorrect or incomplete answers to some questions about how to vote in battleground states ahead of the upcoming U.S. presidential election. The artificial intelligence chatbot, one of several popular large language model (LLM) products that can generate written language, also gave incorrect or incomplete information about elections set to take place even sooner in other countries.\n\nCBS News asked ChatGPT a number of practical questions that a prospective voter might have about how and where to vote, deadlines to vote and other requirements for voting in the battleground states of North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan.\n\nChatGPT did give some correct answers and, in one case, it updated its answer over a short period of time so that when it was asked the same question a few hours later, its response went from incorrect to correct. But it also gave a number of incorrect or incomplete answers. For some questions, its answers updated from incorrect to correct over a number of days.\n\nOpenAI, ChatGPT's parent company, said in a blog post in January that the program would \"direct users to CanIVote.org, the authoritative website on US voting information, when asked certain procedural election related questions \u2014 for example, where to vote.\"\n\nWhile the chatbot's answers to CBS News' election-related questions often included advice to seek out official election information, they did not always include a banner referring users to CanIVote.org.\n\n\"It's concerning if you look at the broader trends of how LLMs are being advertised and how they're being deployed,\" Henry Ajder, an expert on AI and deepfakes, told CBS News. \"If you're trying to incorporate these tools into services which people typically think of as factually accurate or at least authoritative, that's when you start to have problems.\"\n\nIn response to CBS News' questions, a spokesperson for ChatGPT's parent company OpenAI said: \"Preventing artificial intelligence from being used to interfere in this year's elections is a priority for OpenAI. We prohibit the use of our tools for campaigning and we've built safety measures into our products, like declining requests to generate images of real people - including political candidates. We've also developed partnerships to ensure people using ChatGPT for information about voting get directed to authoritative sources. We are closely monitoring how our technology is being used in the elections context and continue to evolve our approach.\"\n\nWhen the same questions posed by CBS News to ChatGPT were asked of Microsoft and Google's LLM chatbots, Copilot and Gemini, neither provided answers at all, either saying they \"can't respond to this topic,\" or that they are \"still learning\" how to respond.\n\nWhen asked by CBS News about why this may have been the case, Microsoft responded: \"As we work to improve our tools to perform to our expectations for the 2024 elections, some election-related prompts may be redirected to search.\" Google said: \"In preparation for the many elections happening around the world in 2024 and out of an abundance of caution, we're restricting the types of election-related queries for which Gemini will return responses.\"\n\nHere are some of the questions CBS News asked ChatGPT that initially drew incorrect or incomplete answers, and the responses, state by state:\n\nNorth Carolina:\n\nCBS News question: \"What is the deadline to mail in my ballot in North Carolina?\"\n\n-Real answer: The ballot must be received by 7:30 p.m. on election day.\n\n-Incorrect ChatGPT answer: The ballot must be postmarked by election day and can be received up to three days after.\n\nDays later when asked the same question, ChatGPT gave different responses when asked on different devices. On one computer and one phone, its answer was accurate, on a separate phone, its answer was still incorrect.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nCBS News question: \"When is my deadline to mail in my ballot in Pennsylvania?\"\n\n-Real answer: A ballot must be received by election officials by 8:00pm on election day.\n\n-Incorrect ChatGPT answer: A ballot must be postmarked by 8:00pm on election day and received by the county election office by 5:00pm the Friday after election day.\n\nWhen asked the same question hours later, ChatGPT updated its response returned a correct answer.\n\nWisconsin\n\nCBS News question: \"What do I need to vote absentee in Wisconsin?\"\n\n-Real answer: Wisconsin requires that an absentee ballot is filled out in the presence of a witness, who then completes a 'Certification of Witness' section.\n\n-Incomplete ChatGPT answer: ChatGPT listed seven things you need to vote absentee in Wisconsin, but did not mention the need for a witness to sign a ballot in order for it to be counted.\n\nDays later, ChatGPT provided a different answer that referenced the need for a witness.\n\nMichigan\n\nCBS News question: \"Can I vote early if I live in Michigan?\"\n\nReal answer: Yes. There is early in-person voting in Michigan for a minimum of nine consecutive days, ending on the Sunday before election day. In some areas, this period could be longer.\n\nIncorrect ChatGPT answer: The way to vote early in Michigan is through in-person absentee voting, meaning a voter needs to request an absentee ballot in the mail can drop the ballot off at a specified site.\n\nInternational\n\nIn addition to getting things wrong about how to vote in the upcoming U.S. presidential election, ChatGPT gave incorrect answers to basic questions about elections overseas.\n\nWhen asked \"Do I need an ID to vote in the U.K.,\" ChatGPT incorrectly said that an ID is currently not required to vote in England, Wales and Scotland. In reality, a photo ID is required to vote in all three countries, as well as Northern Ireland, and if a voter doesn't have one, they will be turned away from their polling station. A few days later when asked again, ChatGPT said that an ID would be required to vote.\n\nAfter the French far-right did well in the European Parliamentary elections, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that France would hold a snap legislative election later this summer. Asked when the French Parliamentary elections are set to take place, ChatGPT incorrectly said that they were scheduled for 2027.\n\nPotential to scale inauthentic operations on social media\n\nAjder said that, while giving incorrect election information is a concern, he's focused more on the potentially harmful role LLMs like ChatGPT could play in elections by increasing bot activity on social media platforms.\n\n\"They could potentially be used to scale inauthentic operations on platforms like X or Twitter to basically try and get things trending and basically provide bad actors with a cheaper and quicker way to scale... to spread false narratives or to try and even persuasively encourage people to act or vote certain ways,\" he told CBS News.\n\nWhen it comes to gathering information about elections and political candidates, Ajder said \"the best way to do it is probably to rely on sources that are trusted and fundamentally driven by human journalists who do the hard work.\"",

        "text": "Do debates still matter? Impact wanes amid polarization, viral competition: Experts\nCandidates are vying for an smaller group of undecided voters, historians say.\n\nIn the 64 years since the first Kennedy-Nixon televised faceoff in 1960 brought the presidential debate stage into Americans' living rooms as never before, they've become a cornerstone ritual of the election cycle.\n\nAnd up until the most recent one -- the Sept. 29, 2020 matchup in Cleveland between then-former Vice President Joe Biden and then-President Donald Trump -- they've generated memorable -- even historic -- moments.\n\nPresidential candidates, Vice President Richard M. Nixon and Senator John F. Kennedy are shown at the fourth and last of their televised presidential debates, on Oct. 21, 1960, at the ABC Studios in New York. Archive Photos via Getty Images, FILE\n\nBut beyond those footnotes in the history books, experts and historians say the country's increased polarization, changing media landscape and campaign strategies have weakened the impact of presidential debates.\n\nAaron Kall, director of debate for the University of Michigan's Debate Program, told ABC News the majority of those who tune in are likely already locked into a preferred candidate.\n\n\"Nothing that occurs during the 90-minute debate is going to change or influence who they're going to vote for,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Kall and other experts ABC News spoke with said there is still a smaller group of undecided voters who do tune in and can be swayed by the performances.\n\nWith the last two presidential elections decided by just tens of thousands of votes in a few states -- many cast by independent voters -- candidates' debate strategies have become laser-focused on courting that group, according to Julien Labarre, administrator of the University of California Santa Barbara's Center of Information Technology & Society.\n\n\"What we see is people who were not thinking of going to vote being turned into voters,\" he told ABC News. \"Spurring people into participation, we do see that kind of effect.\"\n\nKall, the co-author of \"Debating the Donald,\" said past presidential debates have created make-or-break moments for campaigns. For example, during the Oct. 6, 1976, debate between President Gerald Ford and then former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter, Ford stated, \"There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe,\" and then doubled down on it.\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee Jimmy Carter (left) and President Jerry Ford, are shown during sthe econd debate at San Francisco's Palace of Fine Arts, on Oct 6, 1976. Bettmann Archive via GettY Images\n\n\"Just a big gaffe like that, everyone focused on it,\" Kall said. \"That really hurt him and helped propel Carter to a very close election.\"\n\nEventually, campaigns would catch on to this trend and how it could sway voters, Kall said. With each new presidential election cycle, candidates worked with their campaign team to produce \"zingers\" and train candidates when to use them in the debate.\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan famously joked about his Democrat opponent Walter Mondale's age to counter the arguments that Reagan, at 73, was too old to serve a second term.\n\nWhile the rise of the 24-hour news cycle has decreased the shelf-life of those debate highlights -- having less of an impact on voters -- social media has allowed them to live longer in the news cycle and in the political conversation, Kall said.\n\n\"That becomes its own media cycle in the coming days or weeks following the debates,\" he added.\n\nLabarre said that this debate strategy, however, has been turning off some voters as the candidates have been more combative and aggressive in their debating, looking for zingers to go viral.\n\n\"You start having an increase in what we call affective polarization, which is, when parties start being hostile, not in terms of what they stand for, but in terms of just who they are,\" he said.\n\nThis year's presidential debates have the potential to shake things up and generate more interest because of the big changes, including earliest-ever timing and tighter rules, the experts said.\n\nBiden and Trump have, so far, forgone cooperating with the Commission on Presidential Debates, the non-partisan group that has coordinated presidential debates since 1988, and instead agreed to hold a debate Thursday on CNN and another on Sept. 10 on ABC.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden take part in the first presidential debate at Case Western Reserve University and Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, on Sept. 29, 2020. Olivier Douliery, POOL via AFP via Getty Images, FILE\n\nThis week's debate will not feature a live studio audience and the candidates' mics will be muted when it's not their turn to speak.\n\nLabarre said those changes are good steps to help bring engagement from voters in watching and pushing the candidates to address topics more seriously -- perhaps making the debate more relevant.\n\n\"All of a sudden the two candidates are not really putting on a show. They're actually having a conversation,\" he said.\n\nKall said that this week's contest is also remarkable in that Trump and Biden have not engaged in any in-person political debate since the last election, so there might be extra attention from the general public to tune in and see what happens.\n\n\"The earlier debates can focus the race on this binary choice that everybody is going to have to make,\" he said. \"We'll shift the attention and focus to this important two-person race.\"\n\nKall, who will be assessing Thursday's debate as an analyst, added that the event marks the earliest a presidential faceoff has taken place in 64 years and will help inform voters who head to the polls in early voting.\n\n\"The last several cycles, because of COVID and other things, people started voting even before the debates in the fall,\" he said. \"So, people have the opportunity to tune in, see the debate, the platforms [and] the agendas before making that decision.\"\n\nIn this Oct. 21, 2020, file photo, the stage for the final presidential debate of the US 2020 presidential elections is being tested for light and sound at Belmont University in Nashville, Tenn. Eric Baradat/AFP via Getty Images, FILE\n\nLabarre said the political science community and candidates won't immediately know what effect changes to the format will have going forward on the campaigns or on the election.\n\nHowever, he stressed that more changes to the debate system are needed to help an electorate that has become calcified with each new election cycle.\n\nHe said it would be crucial for more debates throughout the election season so that voters get a chance to truly understand where the candidates stand on issues affecting the country.\n\nLabarre noted that previous political debates, such as the 1858 Abraham Lincoln-Fredrick Douglas debate on slavery, focused on just one topic and took place over several days, allowing the candidates to have much more robust discussions.\n\n\"We should have a lot more debates that are focused on a single or two or three issues and not have a gazillion issues talked about over a period of 90 minutes,\" he said.",

        "text": "Anti-Trump Republican Adam Kinzinger endorses Biden for president\nThe former Republican representative Adam Kinzinger has endorsed Joe Biden for president, as the Biden campaign attempts to win over anti-Trump voters ahead of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nIn a video released on Wednesday, Kinzinger said he was a \u201cproud conservative\u201d who had put \u201cdemocracy and our constitution above all else.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s because of my unwavering support for democracy that today, as a proud conservative, I\u2019m endorsing Joe Biden for re-election,\u201d Kinzinger said.\n\nKinzinger warned that former president Donald Trump poses a \u201cdirect threat to every fundamental American value.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t care about our country. He doesn\u2019t care about you. He only cares about himself,\u201d Kinzinger added.\n\nBiden acknowledged Kinzinger\u2019s endorsement in a reply on X.\n\n\u201cThis is what putting your country before your party looks like. I\u2019m grateful for your endorsement, Adam,\u201d Biden said.\n\nKinzinger\u2019s announcement has received predictable flak from far-right Republicans.\n\nIn a reply to the endorsement, Representative Majorie Taylor Greene of Georgia said: \u201cOh look, Kinzinger finally came out of the closet. As usual, we knew all along, so not a surprise and none of us care.\u201d\n\nKinzinger has remained one of the most staunch Republican critics of Trump.\n\nFollowing the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol, Kinzinger publicly denounced Trump for inciting \u201can angry mob\u201d with false claims of stolen election results. Kinzinger was also among 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump.\n\nLater, Kinzinger and Republican representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming were the only two Republicans who joined a committee to investigate the Capitol insurrection.\n\nKinzinger later announced he would not seek re-election in 2021 after facing a potential primary challenge from a pro-Trump candidate due to changes in district mapping.\n\nIn a February interview with the Guardian, the former congressman warned that a second Trump term would be \u201cdevastating for the world order\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe best-case scenario is a completely inept, ineffective government,\u201d Kinzinger said.\n\n\u201cThe worst-case scenario is look, in his four-year term, he did not understand what he was doing. He was just trying to survive and he actually listened to people around him until the end. Now he\u2019s going to put people around him that share his views, that will only reaffirm his views and, frankly, some of these people are pretty smart and they know how to work around the constitution or around the law to bring these authoritarian measures in.\u201d\n\nKinzinger\u2019s announcement comes weeks after the Biden-Harris campaign announced that Kinzinger\u2019s former chief of staff Austin Weatherford would be running the Biden campaign\u2019s outreach to Republican voters.",

        "text": "What would Trump 2.0 mean for coal?\nGone are the vows to end \u201cthe war on beautiful, clean coal.\u201d\n\nAs former President Donald Trump makes his second run for the White House, the beleaguered coal industry that built the U.S. into an economic giant over the past century is less prominent on the campaign trail, overshadowed by rhetoric on electric vehicles and wind power.\n\nBut that\u2019s not stopping much of the coal industry from lining up behind Trump, whose campaign insists the former president is poised to revive the sagging industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNo one has done more damage to the American coal industry than Joe Biden,\u201d Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said in an email. \u201cPresident Trump ushered in unprecedented levels of energy independence for America. And he will do so again.\u201d\n\nWhile the winner of the November election may not determine the ultimate fate of coal \u2014 which is in steep decline in the U.S. \u2014 the next president could influence how long it sticks around as a source of power in a climate-constrained world.\n\nAlong with playing a potential role with what happens to EPA rules on power plants, the next occupant of the White House could affect the cleanup of former mines, the pace of federal reviews for coal mine expansions, and the outcome of a proposed moratorium on coal leasing on public lands in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and Montana.\n\nThe next president could also affect what happens to tens of thousands of former coal miners who may continue to see jobs wiped away as the nation moves more to renewables and gas. That will hinge partly on whether the next administration provides tax incentives, grants and loans to companies that build clean energy projects in former coal regions.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely elections matter, and it\u2019s pretty clear the Biden administration is not a friend of coal,\u201d said Steven Winberg, a former Energy Department official during the Trump administration who now leads an industry group focused on carbon capture and utilization.\n\nThe Biden campaign did not respond when asked for comment.\n\nCoal\u2019s decline is praised by environmentalists, who note that plants running on the fuel produce roughly double the carbon dioxide emissions as ones with natural gas and are responsible for pollution and public health problems such as black lung disease.\n\nBut fossil fuel advocates such as Michelle Bloodworth, president and CEO of the lobby group America\u2019s Power, point to rising electricity demand forecasts to argue coal, which can provide power 24 hours a day unlike intermittent sources like wind and solar, deserves to stick around in the U.S. electricity mix.\n\nA new Trump presidency is likely to \u201crestore a responsible, all-of-the-above approach to energy policy that fosters domestic innovation and strengthens our economic competitiveness,\u201d she said. Bloodworth said America\u2019s Power does not endorse presidential candidates.\n\nOthers say a new Trump administration could make a difference for coal on the margins, by backing rules and regulations that help keep existing plants online longer.\n\n\u201cThe conversation is more likely to be about how long existing coal facilities can continue to operate and what kind of investments would companies put into those facilities to allow them to continue to operate,\u201d said Charles McConnell, a former official with DOE and the National Coal Council who now directs the Center for Carbon Management in Energy at the University of Houston, in an interview.\n\n\u201cIf you look across the board of coal producers in this country, you have a few that are going to do I think OK for the next 5-10 years, and you\u2019ll see some race to the bottom investments,\u201d he said.\n\nA wild card for the fuel\u2019s future is EPA\u2019s power plant rules, which would require coal-fired plants to retrofit and use carbon capture technology to control 90 percent of their greenhouse gas emissions by 2032 or shut down by 2039. The same time frame would also apply to new natural gas-fired power plants that run at least 40 percent of the time.\n\nThe regulations have left the coal sector fuming. States, rural electric co-ops, and investor-owned electric utilities are currently challenging the EPA rule in court. But bipartisan support exists for carbon-capturing technology \u2014 a potential lifeline for coal.\n\nTrump\u2019s wish list\n\nTrump\u2019s fiery energy rhetoric on the campaign trail about EVs, natural gas and wind contrast with 2016 and the first two years of his administration, when he pledged to \u201cput miners back to work\u201d and boost \u201cbeautiful clean coal.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have ended the war on American Energy \u2014 and we have ended the war on clean coal,\u201d Trump declare in his 2018 State of the Union Address. \u201cWe are now very proudly an exporter of energy to the world.\u201d\n\nWhen Trump has spoken about mining in recent months while crisscrossing the country \u2014 such as when he vowed to bring Minnesota\u2019s Iron Range \u201croaring back to life\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s been focused more on industries such as taconite that\u2019s used to make steel, rather than coal.\n\n\u201cPolitically, it just doesn\u2019t make sense for him to focus his campaign on broken promises,\u201d said Erin Bates, a spokesperson for United Mine Workers of America, which has yet to endorse a candidate. \u201cDuring his term, not a single coal miner returned back to work. Not one coal-fired power plant was saved because of federal incentives.\u201d\n\nYet Trump isn\u2019t ignoring coal, and his campaign insists the former president is focused on reviving it.\n\nThe former president\u2019s campaign website touts Trump\u2019s plans to provide relief to Biden\u2019s \u201csuffocating\u201d tax hikes on American coal, oil and gas producers. It also highlights Trump\u2019s past work to reverse an Obama-era moratorium on federal coal leasing, as well as a host of other regulations \u2014 including those affecting emissions and coal ash.\n\n\u201cChina is building a coal plant every week. Every single week they\u2019re putting up a new coal plant. And we\u2019re playing games with the wind,\u201d the site states.\n\nCoal mining in Wyoming\u2019s Powder River Basin. | Ryan Dorgan/Casper Star-Tribune via AP\n\nTrump also has coal leaders in his corner, including Joe Craft, who is fundraising for the Republican nominee while serving as president and CEO of Alliance Resource Partners, one of the largest coal producers in the eastern U.S.\n\nAllied Resource Partners did not respond to requests for comment. Craft, who supported a range of candidates in the Republican presidential primary, reportedly held a fundraiser for Trump as late as last month.\n\nMajor coal groups say they plan to be more outspoken as the presidential race moves into its final months.\n\n\u201cWe are hoping President Trump has a second term and the current president vacates the White House on Jan. 1,\u201d said Chris Hamilton, president of the West Virginia Coal Association, whose members include companies such as Arch Resources and CONSOL, in an interview.\n\n\u201cWe do intend on playing a bigger role with respect to those issues as we move into the fall,\u201d Hamilton added.\n\n\u2018The pain hasn\u2019t let up\u2019\n\nCoal production and consumption for power continue to drop nationwide.\n\nThe Energy Information Administration forecasts that coal, which accounted for 17 percent of U.S. power generation in 2023, will drop to 15 percent in 2025.\n\nOn the supply side, coal production is expected to fall from almost 510 million short tons in 2024 to 500 million short tons in 2025. That\u2019s compared to more than 750 million short tons in 2017, when Trump took office. As it stands, the U.S. electricity grid now holds more electrons produced by renewables than coal \u2014 a major departure from the past.\n\nJobs, in turn, are taking a hit. Today, there are about 43,000 coal miners in the U.S., according to federal data, compared to around 52,000 in 2016.\n\nAccording to a post on UMWA\u2019s \u201cPreserving Coal Country\u201d campaign website, coal jobs, mining and consumption have continued to crater.\n\n\u201cThe pain hasn\u2019t let up,\u201d authors of the post wrote.\n\nMcConnell and others say climate change and EPA regulations \u2014 along with near ubiquity now of cheap natural gas \u2014 spell trouble for coal long term, even as consumption of the fuel increases globally.\n\nNeil Chatterjee, a Trump appointee and former member and chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said the politics of coal are regional in the U.S., and that won\u2019t change with the occupant of the White House.\n\n\u201cIn certain regions of the country where coal is a more significant part of the generation mix, like in Missouri or Kentucky or in Wyoming or Montana, there\u2019s going to be pressure to keep some of those plants open, regardless of what happens in the election,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Kentucky, where I\u2019m from, they\u2019re going to still be burning coal for a long time.\u201d\n\nEven so, McConnell doubts another coal plant will be built in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe energy transition, or if you will, transformation is underway, and that momentum isn\u2019t going to get changed by a different White House for four years,\u201d he said. \u201cIt might feel good for a moment for those in the coal industry. But it\u2019s not really a sustainable long term situation.\u201d\n\nCoal\u2019s critics agree.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the U.S. will produce more coal under Trump versus Biden. We saw in Trump\u2019s prior term as president that he made these big promises to bring back coal, especially in West Virginia, and none of that came to pass,\u201d said Mary Ann Hitt, the former director of the Sierra Club\u2019s Beyond Coal campaign who now directs U.S. Initiatives at Climate Imperative.\n\nSearching for lifelines\n\nBiden has sharpened his pitch to coal country in recent months in the form of jobs and programs tied to the Inflation Reduction Act and bipartisan infrastructure law.\n\nIn battleground states like Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona, the Biden administration has poured tens of millions of dollars into supporting renewable energy production at mine sites and retraining workers in areas gutted by a national shift away from coal.\n\n\u201cThe president has delivered time and time again, not through rhetoric, but through reality game changers on the ground,\u201d White House climate adviser Ali Zaidi told reporters in March after the administration unveiled $475 million to fund solar, geothermal, microgrids and pumped-storage hydropower projects at mine sites.\n\nBut supporters of miners say the mining sector has yet to see high-paying, steady manufacturing jobs produced by the Biden funding. And Trump, they say, isn\u2019t going to succeed in resuscitating coal, meaning the focus must remain on helping workers as industry jobs disappear.\n\nCoal miners in Pennsylvania in 2017. | Justin Merriman/Getty Images\n\n\u201cNeither candidate is helping coal miners,\u201d said Bates with the United Mine Workers of America. \u201cA lot of members, and a lot of coal miners right now, are scared about what the future holds. You have one candidate that didn\u2019t [uphold] his promises in 2016, but you have another administration that is pushing an EPA rule that is going to rapidly close down coal-fired power plants.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how much carbon capture could help coal and its related jobs, too. There currently is one U.S. coal plant that uses carbon capture at scale. Critics of the technology say it\u2019s too expensive and that there are cheaper options for power.\n\nBates and others are calling for better environmental stewardship and jobs programs in coal-producing regions.\n\n\u201cI think one of the biggest things that is at stake is: Will that transition happen in a way that protects public health and supports coal communities, which is something the Biden administration has prioritized, or will those supports be taken away, which I think is what would happen under a Trump administration,\u201d said Hitt, who pointed to funding and tax incentives for coal regions in the IRA and bipartisan infrastructure law.\n\nOther environmental groups say the next administration could play an important role in determining what happens to coal companies that currently are flouting cleanup responsibilities.\n\n\u201cThe big question mark for us is what either administration will do about the issue of mine reclamation,\u201d said Chelsea Barnes, director of government affairs and strategy at the environmental group Appalachian Voices, which does not endorse presidential candidates. \u201cA lot of companies are using bankruptcy and other means to cut corners and not reclaim their mine sites. Neither administration has done anything about that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge problem in Appalachia,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother factor for both Trump and Biden is that some key coal supporters on Capitol Hill, such as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Sen. Joe Manchin (I-W.Va.), are leaving Washington this year. Even so, other lawmakers from coal-reliant western states are still going to bat for the industry and hoping Trump will deliver a lifeline.\n\nMontana Republican Sen. Steve Daines, for one, is pushing legislation to accelerate federal reviews of coal mine expansions in his state while accusing agencies of slow-walking the process.\n\nOthers are looking to block Biden\u2019s proposed freeze on future coal leasing in the Powder River Basin, even though that move will likely have a limited effect on the industry, given the federal government has not executed a new coal lease in the region since 2012.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible policy,\u201d Wyoming GOP Sen. Cynthia Lummis said at the POLITICO Energy Summit this month about Biden\u2019s position. \u201cUntil we have sources of base load to replace coal, we still need coal in this country.\u201d",

Kennedy Jr. , with the remainder writing in other choices.\n\n, as opposed to just 20% for the incumbent, . 7% plan to vote for , with the remainder writing in other choices. 57% of respondents identified as Republican, while Independent was the next highest answer (29%), followed by Democrat (12%).\n\nThe results largely broke along party lines - Republicans strongly favor Trump at 92%, Democrats favor Biden at 83%, and Independents favor Trump slightly at 51%.\n\n83% of those surveyed plan to repeat their vote from the 2020 election.\n\nTrump is overwhelmingly the top choice across service backgrounds, claiming 67% of Military respondents, 85% of Law Enforcement respondents, and 76% of Firefighters.\n\nAmong the Military respondents, 66% of Active Duty and 68% of Veterans say they will vote for Trump.\n\nTrump has the lead across demographics. Male respondents favor Trump at 72%, while female respondents came in at 58%.

Biden and Trump have high unfavorables, raising third-party candidate appeal and potential vote share in states that are often decided by thousands of votes.\n\nPolling and historic trends single out the well-established Libertarian and Green parties\u2019 nominees, Kennedy, who has historically high polling for an independent candidate, and academic Cornel West as the most influential candidates.\n\nGetting on the ballot is arduous, expensive and bureaucratic, and every state has different requirements.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever tried to circulate a birthday card around your office, Amato wrote, \u201cyou may have a ten-thousandth of an idea how difficult it is to collect this many signatures across fifty states and the District of Columbia.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re tracking who\u2019s on the ballot, where and why it matters.",

        "text": "Third-party and independent candidates for president often fall short of early polling numbers\nIndependent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. speaks during a voter rally in Aurora, Colorado, on May 19, 2024. (Helen H. Richardson/MediaNews Group/The Denver Post via Getty Images)\n\nThe 2024 presidential campaign stands out as the first presumptive rematch between major-party candidates since 1956. It\u2019s also the first time an ex-president has run to reclaim the White House in more than a century.\n\nAnother uncommon feature is the presence of several high-profile alternative candidates, including Democratic-scion-turned-independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr., independent Cornel West and three-time Green Party nominee Jill Stein.\n\nKennedy, an environmental lawyer and anti-vaccine activist, is currently polling in the mid-single digits nationally. He appears to draw support both from people who might otherwise back President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, complicating both men\u2019s campaign calculations. (Bear in mind that accurately gauging support for third-party candidates can be tricky.)\n\nBut U.S. political history tells us that third-party and independent candidates usually finish a lot lower than where they start.\n\nWe examined preelection polls in six presidential contests that featured significant third-party or independent candidates, then reviewed those candidates\u2019 actual shares of the popular vote in the general election.\n\nNot only did support for third-party and independent candidates tend to decline over the course of their campaigns, but their vote shares often came in lower than polls suggested they might.\n\nHere\u2019s an election-by-election look at underperformance by third-party and independent candidates.\n\nHow we did this Given the unusual dynamics of the 2024 presidential election \u2013 including the presence of several potentially significant third-party and independent candidates \u2013 Pew Research Center examined how such candidates fared in past elections. We focused on the six elections over the past 60 years in which the major-party share of the nationwide popular vote was less than 98%. In each of those elections, an independent or third-party candidate won at least 2% of the vote. For each of those candidates, we obtained support-level data via iPoll, an online archive of historical survey data maintained by Cornell University\u2019s Roper Center for Public Opinion Research. For 1980 and subsequent elections, we limited our analysis to surveys of registered voters. No such surveys were available for the 1968 election, so in that case we used surveys of the national adult population. Over the decades, survey modes shifted from predominantly face-to-face interviews to landline telephone interviews, and then to landline-plus-cellphone interviews. By 2016, online surveys were making their first appearances, but most polls were still conducted via phone. To avoid any distortions caused by such different survey modes, we used only surveys conducted by the same mode within a given year. This meant that we only used face-to-face surveys in 1968, and only phone surveys in all other years we analyzed. We also looked at the wording of each individual question to make sure each survey was asking essentially the same thing in similar ways. In particular, we wanted to ensure that candidates were referred to by name and identified by party (or as \u201cindependent\u201d when appropriate). Once we had assembled a list of comparable questions, we plotted support for third-party and independent candidates on a timeline. The final point on each chart represents the candidate\u2019s share of the total nationwide popular vote. For 1968 through 2000, we used figures from America Votes, a long-running compilation of election data. For the 2016 election, we compiled official returns from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. With two exceptions, all support figures in this analysis include those who said they would vote for or leaned toward the candidate in question. The exceptions are John Anderson in 1980 (because no surveys with \u201cleaner\u201d questions met our inclusion criteria) and Ross Perot in 1992, during the interim period in which he wasn\u2019t actively campaigning (because surveys did not typically ask \u201cleaner\u201d questions about him during this period).\n\n1968: George Wallace\n\nFresh off his first term as Alabama\u2019s segregationist governor, George Wallace \u2013 running a \u201claw and order\u201d-themed campaign under the American Independent Party banner \u2013 saw his support rise in polls over the spring and summer leading up to the 1968 election. In April, around 10% of adults nationally said they supported or leaned toward Wallace. By September, that had doubled to 20%. Wallace appeared within reach of his goal: dividing the field enough to throw the election to the House of Representatives, where he could try to bargain his electoral votes for \u201cconcessions\u201d on desegregation, voting rights and other issues.\n\nThat fall, Republican Richard Nixon\u2019s campaign began warning conservatives that voting for Wallace would only help Democrat Hubert Humphrey. Meanwhile, Democratic-aligned unions worked to pull their members \u2013 whom Wallace had targeted \u2013 back into Humphrey\u2019s fold. Wallace\u2019s running mate, retired Air Force Gen. Curtis LeMay, also made headlines at his introductory press conference after saying he\u2019d consider using nuclear weapons in Vietnam.\n\nWallace\u2019s support in the polls began to slide, reaching the mid-teens in the weeks before Election Day. He ended up with 13.5% of the popular vote and 46 electoral votes \u2013 not enough to keep Nixon from winning the White House.\n\n1980: John Anderson\n\nRep. John Anderson of Illinois was trailing badly in the Republican presidential primaries when, in April 1980, he dropped out and said he would run as an independent instead. Anderson\u2019s candidacy generated considerable public interest: Around 20% of registered voters said they would support him, and he continued to poll around that level throughout the spring.\n\nBut Anderson\u2019s nascent campaign had to spend much time and energy that spring and summer simply getting his name on state ballots. Anderson faded from view during that summer\u2019s Democratic and Republican conventions. Incumbent President Jimmy Carter, the Democrat, refused to share a debate stage with him in the fall \u2013 though Republican nominee Ronald Reagan did debate Anderson one-on-one.\n\nBy October, Anderson\u2019s support in polls had dwindled to the 9%-10% range. In the end, he won 6.6% of the national popular vote.\n\n1992: Ross Perot\n\nMoney and visibility weren\u2019t issues for Ross Perot, the billionaire businessman from Texas who mounted a stop-and-go independent campaign against Republican President George H.W. Bush and his Democratic challenger, Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton.\n\nPerot\u2019s effort, driven initially by volunteers and appearances on Larry King Live, quickly gained momentum. In March, as Perot\u2019s backers began gathering the hundreds of thousands of petition signatures he would need to get on state ballots, Perot was regularly receiving support from 20% or more of registered voters in polls. By May, about a third of registered voters were telling pollsters they\u2019d vote for or were leaning toward Perot. In a few surveys, he led both Bush and Clinton.\n\nAmid sharpening attacks from Republicans and Democrats, though, Perot\u2019s numbers began falling. In mid-July, when his support was below 20% in most polls, Perot abruptly quit the race.\n\nAlthough Perot was no longer actively campaigning, his name remained on two dozen state ballots, and some never-say-die supporters continued working to gain him ballot access in additional states. Pollsters continued to ask voters about Perot throughout the summer and fall \u2013 especially as speculation grew that he might jump back into the race. While Perot\u2019s support declined steadily during this interim period, in late September around 10% of voters still said they preferred him to Bush or Clinton.\n\nPerot reentered the campaign in early October, and within a few weeks his support had climbed back up to around 20%, including leaners. It began to slip again as Election Day neared, falling to around 15%. In the end, Perot won 18.9% of the popular vote \u2013 the best showing by a non-major-party candidate since Theodore Roosevelt 80 years earlier.\n\n1996: Ross Perot\n\nPerot wouldn\u2019t come close to that in his second campaign. At the start of the year, when it was still unclear whether he would seek the nomination of the Reform Party (which he had founded the year before), his support among registered voters typically was in the mid-teens.\n\nBut Perot\u2019s support declined during the campaign, eventually settling at around 5%-7%, including leaners. His poll numbers did pick up a bit in the run-up to Election Day, when he received 8.4% of the popular vote. Among the minor candidates Perot beat out for third place: consumer advocate Ralph Nader, who took 0.7% representing the Green Party.\n\n2000: Ralph Nader and Pat Buchanan\n\nNader had a considerably higher profile four years later, when he was again the Green Party\u2019s nominee. Polls taken during that close, contentious campaign regularly found that around 5% of registered voters said they supported or leaned toward Nader.\n\nThat was enough to concern Democrats that Nader threatened Vice President Al Gore\u2019s chances of defeating Republican Texas Gov. George W. Bush. (Whether he in fact did so is still hotly debated among political scientists, journalists and other observers.)\n\nIn the end, Nader won only 2.7% of the national popular vote. But in several closely divided states \u2013 including Florida and New Hampshire, both of which Bush carried \u2013 Nader\u2019s share was enough to potentially swing the outcome.\n\nAnother third-party candidate in 2000 received a fair amount of public and media attention: Pat Buchanan, the conservative commentator who had captured the nomination of Perot\u2019s Reform Party. Buchanan polled as high as 4% in the spring, but by fall was mostly in the 1%-2% range. He ended up with less than 0.5% of the popular vote, but did well enough in five states to theoretically (or perhaps not so theoretically) affect the outcome.\n\n2016: Gary Johnson and Jill Stein\n\nWidespread dissatisfaction with Republican Trump and his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, may have caused more voters than usual to look beyond the major parties. Two candidates in particular received considerable attention: former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson \u2013 the Libertarian Party nominee \u2013 and physician and activist Jill Stein of the Green Party. (Both Johnson and Stein had also run in 2012, though with less impact.)\n\nJohnson polled fairly strongly into the fall, with 8%-12% of registered voters routinely saying that they would vote for him or were leaning toward him. But Johnson\u2019s poll numbers began trending downward, and by Election Day his support level was hovering around 5%-6%. Johnson ended up receiving 3.3% of the vote \u2013 the 52-year-old Libertarian Party\u2019s best showing in a presidential election to date.\n\nFor her part, Stein often received support from 5%-7% of registered voters in polls taken during the spring and summer of 2016. But her support also eroded as the campaign went on, and she eventually received just over 1% of the popular vote \u2013 still the party\u2019s best result since Nader in 2000.",

        "text": "What's at stake in the first presidential debate?\nBig stakes and high tension as Biden-Trump debate looms\n\nBBC\n\nWhen Donald Trump and Joe Biden take to the debate stage on Thursday night, it will be a reunion of sorts \u2013 although not exactly a friendly one. A current president has never before debated his predecessor, and the bad blood between these two men will be obvious on the CNN debate stage in Atlanta. Trump never conceded the 2020 election to President Biden and days after his supporters attacked the US Capitol, he broke with tradition by refusing to attend his opponent\u2019s inauguration. The two men are now facing off again for the presidency and this debate will mark the first time in this election campaign that millions of Americans are sitting up and paying attention. The stakes are high and the tension in the room will be a notch above past tussles, as both men try to convince US voters that they deserve their ballot in November.\n\nAn unusual evening\n\nThursday\u2019s debate will also mark the first time that Joe Biden and Donald Trump have appeared together since their debates four years ago. The initial encounter in 2020 was an acrimonious affair, punctuated by repeated interruptions and Mr Biden\u2019s frustrated \u201cWill you shut up, man?\u201d demand. At the start of the second debate that year, delayed by Trump\u2019s Covid diagnosis, the two men did not even shake hands. This time, both men are out of practice. Neither has participated in any kind of debate in nearly four years, as Trump skipped the Republican primary debates on his way to becoming the party's presumptive nominee earlier this year. What Moscow, Beijing and Delhi think of rematch Incumbent presidents frequently come out flat-footed in their opening re-election debate - a common explanation is that they are rusty or unused to being challenged after four years in the White House bubble. In this case, however, both candidates could face that challenge. Unlike past debates, this one will be conducted in a cable television studio without a live audience to cheer - or groan. That was a request by the Biden campaign, which reportedly was concerned after a raucous Trump town hall forum hosted by CNN last year. The debate will also feature muted microphones for candidates during their opponent's allotted speaking time, which might prevent it from spiralling into the chaos that characterised the first Trump-Biden debate in 2020. But it also could make this version a less memorable affair.\n\nGetty Images Trump and Mr Biden last faced off in October 2020, ahead of that year's presidential election\n\nThe expectations game\n\nIf one listened only to conservative commentators, President Biden will be lucky to make it through the debate without falling asleep, freezing up or wandering around the stage in confusion. Republicans, from Trump on down, have characterised the president as senile and infirm, a shell of the man he once was. While these attacks have played upon very real voter concern about the durability of an octogenarian president, it also has set a low bar for Mr Biden\u2019s performance - an expectation that he has exceeded in the past, including during his energetic State of the Union address in early March. Trump campaign officials recently tried to nudge that bar higher, noting that Mr Biden proved himself to be very effective during the 2012 vice-presidential debate against then-congressman Paul Ryan. They have also questioned the impartiality of debate host CNN. \u201cWill CNN decide that they are facilitator, or will CNN become a participant?\u201d Trump campaign manager Chris LaCivita asked on Tuesday. Trump and his campaign have also spread claims that Mr Biden will need to rely on unspecified \u201cperformance enhancing drugs\u201d during the debate. The notion has been vehemently denied by President Biden's team but the seeding of such rumours could lay the ground for post-debate excuses if the president gets the better of his predecessor on Thursday.\n\nWhat to watch for at Biden and Trump's first 2024 debate\n\nBiden campaign spokeswoman Lauren Hitt said the former president was resorting to \"lies\" because he is \u201cscared of being held accountable for his toxic agenda\u201d. President Biden may not be the only one with an opportunity to defy expectations, however. Democrats have been warning for more than a year that Trump is obsessed with revenge and retribution, and that he is an aspiring dictator who presents an existential threat to American democracy. Biden campaign officials have said that Trump \u201csnapped\u201d after his 2020 election defeat and is a different man than Americans elected in 2016. If the former president can keep his cool for 90 minutes and soften some of his sharper edges, it may help him convince the American public that the dire warnings about a potential second Trump term in office are overblown. \u201cBiden has got to prove that the perception that he's too old for the job is not true,\u201d Mike Murphy, a long-time Republican political consultant, told Americast, the BBC's podcast on US politics. \u201cTrump's got to prove that he is not the unlikable madman that half the country thinks he is. So it's an opportunity for both of them - but also the risk is high.\u201d\n\nMore on the debate\n\nThe issues\n\nComing into this debate, polling indicated that voters gave Trump better marks on the economy and immigration - two of the top issues for American voters. Meanwhile, the president was favoured on abortion, healthcare and the environment. The winner of Thursday night\u2019s debate could well be the candidate who can best land memorable lines on areas of strength while defending his weaknesses. Can President Biden convince voters that he shares their concerns about a surge in immigration but has been stymied by Republicans in trying to deal with it? Will former president Trump find a way to convince voters another term in office won\u2019t lead to greater restrictions on abortion \u2013 particularly given that he appointed three Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn the federal right to the procedure? Mr Biden has been trying for more than a year to convince the American public that the economy is better than they think it is. He\u2019ll have a chance to make that case again to an audience of tens of millions, but he\u2019ll have to do so in the face of what\u2019s sure to be withering attacks from his opponent, who is expected to focus on the soaring prices and high inflation that Americans have had to live with in recent years. \u201cWe know that Joe Biden is going to try to blame everything on President Trump,\u201d Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller told reporters on Tuesday. He added: \u201cAmericans know the difference between the Trump economy, which was great, where everyone was doing better, and the Biden economy.\u201d\n\nGetty Images Thursday's CNN showdown will be held in Atlanta, Georgia, where preparations are already underway\n\nGetting personal\n\nLast week, the Biden campaign launched a new series of advertisements directly attacking Trump for his recent criminal felony conviction in a New York court. Recent polls have indicated that the guilty verdict has cost Donald Trump support among the independent voters who could prove decisive in this election. There\u2019s little question that Trump will be asked about the history-making court case at the debate and that President Biden will be poised to strike. If the former president gets drawn into a tirade against corrupt judges and rigged courts, it could further alienate moderate voters. \u201cIf they can get Trump to burn the mic being a madman on neurotic defence, that is a very good debate thing,\u201d Mr Murphy said. Meanwhile, President Biden has a court case of his own to deal with. His son Hunter\u2019s conviction on felony firearm charges was also history-making, and the president - while not implicated in the case - was emotionally invested in its outcome. Trump may take a few swipes at Hunter Biden, if not about the gun case then about his upcoming tax evasion trial, which could expose controversial details about the younger Biden's business dealings. Trump will probably attempt to paint Hunter Biden's conviction as evidence of more widespread corruption in what he calls the \u201cBiden crime family\u201d.\n\nA long way to go",

As President Abraham Lincoln famously said in his Gettysburg Address delivered on November 19, 1863, during the American Civil War, \u201cDemocracy is the government of the people, by the people, for the people.\u201d Elections serve as a cornerstone of democracy, allowing individuals to freely and peacefully express their will to shape the future of their country.\n\nThe United States was the first nation to recognize Mauritania\u2019s independence in 1960, and President Kennedy welcomed President Daddah to the White House in 1963. Since then, we have remained deeply committed to supporting Mauritania\u2019s democratic journey. Earlier this year, the U.S. government provided financial support to the National Independent Electoral Commission (CENI) to enhance the administration of the elections and to facilitate the voting rights of all eligible voters. The Embassy also coordinated with the Haute Autorit\u00e9 de la Presse et de l\u2019Audiovisuel (HAPA) to bring an American journalist to train Mauritanian journalists in identifying and reporting misinformation, including during elections. Additionally, U.S. embassy personnel, accredited by the National Independent Election Commission (CENI), will observe election day at various polling stations throughout the country. We continue to urge citizens to rely on credible and recognized sources of information.\n\nAs longstanding allies, we extend our best wishes to Mauritania and its citizens for inclusive, free, fair, and transparent elections.",

        "text": "The US election and prospects for peace in key global conflict zones\nEXPERT ANALYSIS\n\nThe 2024 U.S. election is not just high-stakes domestically but could have major implications for armed conflicts around the world.\n\nIn 2024, conflict and political violence have been on the rise: According to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, nearly 1 in 6 people have been exposed to armed conflict in 2024.\n\nIn some of these conflicts\u2014especially in Ukraine, Gaza and Sudan\u2014U.S. foreign policy plays an outsized role in how these wars unfold. With the presidency at stake, a second Biden or Trump administration may respond differently to all three conflicts in ways that could significantly shift their trajectories.\n\nMegan A. Stewart\n\nAs President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump prepare for their scheduled debate tonight, Megan A. Stewart, associate professor at U-M\u2019s Ford School of Public Policy and director of the International Policy Center, discusses the potential implications of the election on prospects for peace in those key conflict zones.\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\nIn February 2022, Russian forces invaded Ukraine to resurrect a broader imperialist project. Since then, the United States and European allies have equipped Ukraine with weapons to claw back territory from the Russian armed forces.\n\nAfter several successes, the Ukrainian offensive stalled as Russian forces created a heavily mined and weaponized frontline. With winter\u2019s end, the Russian troops have begun an offensive in Kharkiv.\n\nThe prospects for an end to war in the short term are not promising, with Russian Armed Forces continuing their aggression and Ukrainian forces continuing efforts to recapture their land. The conquest of Ukraine is part of Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s imperialist dream, and he still retains control of the government. A popular revolution in Russia is unlikely, and a possible Putin successor may similarly support the war.\n\nFor Ukrainians, the Armed Forces can continue to be effective in at least repelling Russian aggression with continued military aid, especially from the U.S. and Europe. Though the Biden administration will likely continue to try to find ways to support Ukraine, a Trump administration might change course. Trump has repeatedly expressed his praise for Putin. A returned Trump administration might reduce or end military support to Ukraine, if not call for an immediate end to the war.\n\nWhile an immediate end to the war may seem like a positive outcome on the pathway to peace, it could have several downsides. Russia still retains control of much Ukrainian territory, and in the territories it occupies, Russia has faced accusations of genocide, war crimes and sexual violence. An end of war would not be the end of violence against the Ukrainian people.\n\nEven if the fighting stopped, the end of hostilities could be temporary: Russia could renege on the peace agreement and reinvade Ukraine. Russia could also use the break in fighting to retool, rest and rearm itself\u2014becoming an even more formidable foe.\n\nIsrael and Hamas\n\nThe prospect of peace in Gaza is similarly slim. In retaliation for the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas, a group that murdered over 1,100 Israeli civilians and kidnapped possibly 252 more, Israel launched a ground invasion of Gaza. Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu set the destruction of Hamas as the goal of the invasion. Since the Israeli invasion, the United Nations estimates that 36,000 Palestinians and 1,500 Israelis have been killed.\n\nThe goal of the destruction of Hamas, however, will be extremely challenging. Hamas is not only a military organization that kills Israeli civilians and battles with the Israeli military, but it is also a political organization that governs Gaza, providing many services there. Of course, not all Palestinians support Hamas, but alternative governance options in Gaza do not exist.\n\nGiven Hamas\u2019 embeddedness in Gaza, military victory will be extremely difficult and deadly to secure. It is also possible that the conflict could spread across the region as skirmishes between Hezbollah in Lebanon and Israel are similarly intensifying.\n\nAt the same time, Netanyahu may continue the war to delay criminal trials in Israel\u2014as his defense has said. The International Criminal Court also requested a warrant for his arrest, alongside Hamas leaders, for war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nGiven its longstanding ties with Israel, the U.S. could play a critical role in ending the violence if it halted military support to Israel and if the Biden administration called for a ceasefire.\n\nBy contrast, Trump and Netanyahu were previously supportive of each other, so it is difficult to see a Trump administration prioritizing a ceasefire. However, in April, he criticized Netanyahu\u2019s preparedness for Oct. 7.\n\nSudan\n\nIn April 2023, amid a transition to a civilian government after three decades of Omar al-Bashir\u2019s rule, fighting erupted in Sudan between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group. The crux of this war is who will retain power in the post-Bashir government.\n\nDespite efforts from the international community for negotiations for peace, at least 16 ceasefires have failed. An estimated 15,000 people have been killed in just one year, and many thousands more have been victimized, including allegations of sexual violence.\n\nSudan was also facing a humanitarian crisis before the fighting exploded, and war has only worsened the conflict. A reported 6.6 million people are internally displaced, and almost 2 million people have fled to other countries. Most of these refugees have fled to Chad or South Sudan, who are similarly facing precarious humanitarian and political positions.\n\nThe lack of attention and continued pressure to end the war is not helping draw the conflict to a close. U.S. Sen. Ben Cardin, Foreign Relations Committee chairman, urged the Biden administration to pressure armed combatants to come to a negotiated settlement and provide sufficient humanitarian aid to address the consequences of the conflict.\n\nIt is unclear whether the Trump administration would provide humanitarian relief to Sudan.",

        "text": "Biden and Trump go head to head: How to watch the first general election presidential debate\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 The first general election debate of the 2024 election season is here, and it\u2019s a historic moment no matter what happens on stage.\n\nFollow AP\u2019s live coverage of the debate.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are taking part in Thursday night\u2019s debate in Atlanta. Not only is it the first-ever matchup between a sitting president and a former one, but it\u2019s also the first debate for either candidate in this year\u2019s election. And it\u2019s happening so early in the general election campaign cycle that neither man will have accepted their party\u2019s formal nomination yet.\n\nHere\u2019s how to watch the debate:\n\nWhat time is the debate?\n\nThe debate will start at 9 p.m. ET Thursday. It\u2019s being moderated by CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper and Dana Bash.\n\nWhat channel is the debate on?\n\nCNN is carrying the debate live on its broadcast network, as well as on CNN International, CNN en Espa\u00f1ol and CNN Max. Viewers can also stream it without a log in on CNN\u2019s website. Several networks have also agreed to carry the event live.\n\nWhere is the debate?\n\nThe setting for the first general election debate is CNN\u2019s studios in Atlanta. Unlike the Republican primary debates, no audience will be present.\n\nOnce a Republican stronghold, Georgia was a pivotal battleground in 2020. Both parties are preparing for another closely contested race in the state this year. Trump also faces an indictment in Georgia for his push to \u201cfind 11,780 votes\u201d and overturn Biden\u2019s victory based on false or unproven theories of voter fraud.\n\nWhich candidates will be on stage?\n\nTwo candidates \u2014 Biden and Trump \u2014 will be on stage. For a time, it seemed like they wouldn\u2019t be meeting up at all.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign had proposed excluding third-party candidates, such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr., from the debates outright. Under the debate commission\u2019s rules, Kennedy or other third-party candidates could qualify if they secured ballot access sufficient to claim 270 Electoral Votes and polled at 15% or higher in a selection of national surveys.\n\nBoth CNN and ABC announced the same qualification threshold, saying candidates will need to reach at least 15% in four separate national polls of registered or likely voters that meet their standards, between March 13 and a week ahead of Thursday\u2019s match up. Last week, CNN announced that Kennedy hadn\u2019t met those markers.\n\nPresidential debate prep: How Biden and Trump are approaching their first face-off in four years\n\nTrump didn\u2019t take part in any of the GOP primary debates, so this is his first time on stage this cycle. Biden didn\u2019t debate any of the Democrats challenging him, either.\n\nLast month, Biden announced that he would not participate in fall presidential debates sponsored by the nonpartisan commission that has organized them for more than three decades. Instead, his campaign proposed that media outlets directly organize the debates between the presumptive Democratic and Republican nominees.\n\nHours later, Biden said he had accepted an invitation from CNN, adding, \u201cOver to you, Donald.\u201d Trump, who had insisted he would debate Biden anytime and anyplace, said on Truth Social he\u2019d be there, too, adding, \u201cLet\u2019s get ready to Rumble!!!\u201d Soon after that, they agreed to a second debate.\n\nWhat\u2019s up next?\n\nABC will host the second debate on Sept. 10. The network has not offered details on where its event would be held, only that it would be moderated by anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget about the running mates. Trump hasn\u2019t named his yet, but Vice President Kamala Harris has accepted an invitation from CBS News to debate her eventual rival in studio on either July 23 or Aug. 13.\n\n___\n\nMeg Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP.",

        "text": "Biden struggles to land lines as Trump lies in first presidential debate\nDonald Trump and Joe Biden sparred over abortion and tax policy in the first presidential debate in which the president struggled to land his lines and the former president repeatedly made false claims about January 6, the national debt, and that he presided over the \u201cgreatest economy in the history of our country\u201d.\n\nBiden described Trump as \u201cthe worst president in American history\u201d, citing a consensus of historians. Trump responded by extolling the historic virtues of his tax cuts. \u201cNobody has ever cut taxes like us. We cut taxes four times,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump regularly answered straightforward questions \u2013 about the economy, abortion or the opioid crisis \u2013 with non sequiturs about immigration or China. He also repeatedly spewed false claims about abortion, the environment and the border. CNN moderators failed to factcheck Trump.\n\nBiden\u2019s voice at times sounded raspy \u2013 the campaign said he has a cold \u2013 and he frequently struggled to complete his thoughts. During one notable moment early in the debate, Biden was laying into Trump over his tax policies and stumbled as he was running out of time to speak, before blurting out: \u201cWe finally beat Medicare.\u201d\n\nAfter the debate, commentators focused on Democrats\u2019 panic about Biden\u2019s performance, with several suggesting the party needs to consider nominating a different candidate at the convention in August. \u201cThe biggest thing in this election is voters\u2019 concerns \u2013 and it\u2019s both swing voters and base voters \u2013 with his age, and those were compounded tonight,\u201d Democratic strategist David Plouffe said on MSNBC.\n\nEarly in the debate, CNN moderator Dana Bash asked Trump about his position on abortion in a post-Roe v Wade environment.\n\n\u201cWhat I did was, I put three supreme court justices on the court and they killed Roe,\u201d Trump said. \u201cRight now, the states control it, and that\u2019s the will of the people,\u201d he added, noting that he favors exceptions to a ban. Biden defended Roe and legal abortion, and Trump responded by drawing the debate into a discussion of illegal immigration.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments about abortion rested on a lie popular with religious conservatives: that Democrats favor policy that allows for abortion up until birth. He also falsely claimed that ending Roe v Wade protections was something \u201ceveryone wanted\u201d, despite consistent polling that shows the public desires at least some access to abortion under the law.\n\nAnd yet, Trump called Biden a liar presenting disinformation.\n\nTrump argued that \u201cmillions of people\u201d are coming across the border and receiving social security benefits \u2013 a claim without evidence. Trump also argued that the opioid problem could be traced to fentanyl manufacturing in China, smuggled into the US across the southern border.\n\nBiden noted that he has a proposal to increase technology and staffing at the border that was rejected by Republicans in Congress at Trump\u2019s behest.\n\nUS elections 2024: a guide to the first presidential debate\n\nThe two candidates sharply differed in their memory and view of the war in Ukraine. Biden labeled Vladimir Putin a war criminal who would extend the war in Ukraine to neighboring Nato states like Poland. Trump, however, called the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the \u201cworld\u2019s greatest salesman\u201d.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Trump turned a question about his search for \u201crevenge\u201d into a diatribe about the president\u2019s son, Hunter Biden.\n\nThe debate in Atlanta holds special significance to Black voters, both in the city where they are an important voting bloc in a swing state, and elsewhere. Biden said he doesn\u2019t blame Black Americans for being disappointed in the progress that has been made under his administration, but noted the historic gains made in employment, loan forgiveness and other measures that have come during the last four years.\n\nTrump\u2019s response was to remind voters that Biden described Black criminals as \u201csuperpredators\u201d early in his political career.\n\nAsked about social security, Biden argued that a tax on millionaires would keep the system solvent without hurting anyone making less than $400,000 a year.\n\n\u201cThe idea that we don\u2019t need to protect seniors is ridiculous,\u201d Biden said, touting the benefits of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBiden replied by describing Trump\u2019s affair with adult film actor Stormy Daniels while his wife Melania was pregnant, calling Trump a man with \u201cthe morals of an alley cat\u201d.\n\nTrump denied sleeping with Daniels.",

        "text": "How to watch the first presidential debate between Biden and Trump\nBreaking down the first presidential debate between Trump and Biden Breaking down the first presidential debate between Trump and Biden 03:33\n\nPresident Biden and former President Donald Trump are facing off for their first debate of the 2024 presidential election cycle on Thursday, with much at stake as national polls have shown the two candidates neck-and-neck.\n\nCNN is hosting the first debate between the two presumptive party nominees on Thursday, June 27 at 9 p.m. ET (6 p.m. PT). The debate will also be simulcast on other networks, including CBS. It's expected to last 90 minutes, and include two commercial breaks.\n\nThe debate will take place at CNN's headquarters in Atlanta, where CNN's Jake Tapper and Dana Bash will moderate. Tapper and Bash have both moderated presidential debates before.\n\nThere will be no studio audience, ensuring that the candidates won't be interrupted by anyone but each other or the moderators. The lack of the audience also helps the TV audience make up their own minds about who performs better, without influence from audience reactions.\n\nCNN also says the microphones will be muted when it's not a candidate's turn to speak, a move intended to limit interruptions.\n\nEarlier this week, Mr. Biden retreated to Camp David with his team to work on debate prep. Trump, without the duties of the Oval Office, has continued to hold rallies, including one in Racine, Wisconsin, on Tuesday. Independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. did not qualify to participate in the debate.\n\nTrump and Mr. Biden are virtually tied in the polls following Trump's criminal conviction in Manhattan last month on 34 counts of falsifying business records. A majority of likely voters say Trump's conviction isn't a factor in their decision, and issues like inflation and the border are much more important to them. Heading into the first debate, the Biden campaign has launched a new TV ad leaning into Trump's status as a \"convicted felon.\"\n\nThursday's debate may feel like a repeat of 2020 for viewers, although the two candidates won't likely be as physically distanced as they were during the pandemic debates. Trump tested positive for COVID-19 just days after their Sept. 29, 2020, presidential debate, the last time the two men were on a stage together.\n\nThe debate will also be simulcast on CBS television stations and CBS News streaming. CBS Evening News anchor and managing editor Norah O'Donnell will anchor a special report, with analysis from CBS News political correspondents and analysts.\n\nHow to watch the first presidential debate\n\nWhat : President Biden and former President Donald Trump debate\n\nPresident Biden and former President Donald Trump debate Date: Thursday, June 27, 2024\n\nThursday, June 27, 2024 Time: Debate begins at 9 p.m. ET, 6 p.m. PT\n\nCoverage and analysis begin at 5 p.m. ET with \"America Decides\" on CBS News 24/7\n\nDebate begins at 9 p.m. ET, 6 p.m. PT Coverage and analysis begin at 5 p.m. ET with \"America Decides\" on CBS News 24/7 Location: CNN studios in Atlanta\n\nCNN studios in Atlanta On TV: CNN (cable) and simulcast on CBS television stations \u2014 find your local CBS station here\n\nCNN (cable) and simulcast on CBS television stations \u2014 find your Online stream: Live on CBS News 24/7 in the player above and on your mobile or streaming device\n\nLive on CBS News 24/7 in the player above and on your mobile or streaming device Follow live updates: On CBSNews.com",

        "text": "WATCH: Where Biden and Trump stand on abortion\nPresident Joe Biden blamed Donald Trump during CNN\u2019s presidential debate for the deluge of state abortion restrictions since the fall of Roe v. Wade.\n\nAs president, Trump appointed three justices to the U.S. Supreme Court who helped form the majority that overturned the constitutional right to abortion \u2014 and he has taken credit for that during his campaign. The reversal has energized many voters who support abortion rights and it helped power Democratic victories in the 2022 midterms and special elections.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a terrible thing what you\u2019ve done,\u201d Biden said, turning to his rival. He pledged to restore the law under Roe if given a second term but didn\u2019t say how he\u2019d accomplish that. He said the idea of turning abortion laws back to states \u201cis like saying we\u2019re going to turn civil rights back to the states.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Trump\u2019s plans for health care and reproductive rights if he returns to White House\n\nHighlighting Trump\u2019s connection to the overturning of Roe v. Wade and its impact on pregnant people across the U.S. has become a cornerstone of Biden\u2019s campaign. Biden has also warned that a second Trump term could lead to nationwide abortion restrictions.\n\nTrump said on the debate stage that he believes in abortion ban exceptions \u201cfor rape, incest and the life of the mother.\u201d\n\nThose exceptions are at the heart of a case the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling on Thursday. Under Idaho\u2019s abortion ban, women have been unable to get abortions in medical emergencies because the state only has an exception to save the life of the mother \u2014 not to save her health.\n\nTrump repeated his catchall states-rights response when abortion rights came up, touting that he returned the abortion question to individual states after the overturning of Roe v. Wade, which once granted a federal right to abortion.\n\nIt\u2019s an attempt to find a more cautious stance on the issue, which has become a vulnerability for Republicans and driven turnout for Democrats.\n\nLIVE FACT CHECK: CNN\u2019s Biden-Trump debate\n\nWhile Trump has repeatedly claimed \u201cthe people\u201d are now the ones deciding abortion access, that\u2019s not true everywhere.\n\nVoters don\u2019t have a direct say through citizen-led ballot measures in about half the states. In those that do allow such measures, abortion rights coalitions in several states this year have faced intense efforts by anti-abortion groups to thwart citizen initiatives on reproductive rights.\n\nVoters in seven states, including conservative ones such as Kentucky, Montana and Ohio, have either protected abortion rights or defeated attempts to curtail them in statewide votes over the past two years.\n\nFind more of our coverage:",

        "text": "Factchecked: Trump and Biden\u2019s presidential debate claims\nModerators in the first presidential debate in 2024 took a completely hands-off approach to factchecking the candidates, letting lies and half-truths, most frequently from Donald Trump, remain unchallenged.\n\nThe former president frequently ignored the questions posed by CNN moderators Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, instead talking about whatever he wanted. In a few instances, they reiterated the question and gave Trump a chance to answer it again.\n\nJoe Biden sometimes pushed back on Trump\u2019s claims, and vice versa, though not always with specificity beyond saying the other was lying.\n\nUS elections 2024: a guide to the first presidential debate\n\nThe light moderation left lingering lies, though the network said before the debate that the moderators wouldn\u2019t intercede.\n\n\u201cObviously, if there is some egregious fact that needs to be checked or the record needs to be made clear, Jake and Dana can do that,\u201d David Chalian, CNN\u2019s political director, told the Associated Press before the debate. \u201cBut that\u2019s not their role. They are not here to participate in this debate. They are here to facilitate a debate between Trump and Biden.\u201d\n\nHere are the facts on some of the false claims offered during Thursday\u2019s debate.\n\nAbortion\n\nThe claim: Trump says Democrats support abortion until birth and that \u201ceverybody\u201d wanted to overturn Roe v Wade.\n\nThe facts: Later abortions are a common line of attack among Republicans \u2013 but it\u2019s based on a myth. Less than 1% of abortions in the US are performed at or past 21 weeks, largely because of fetal abnormalities or lack of access to care earlier in pregnancy.\n\nAnd Roe remained popular throughout the half-century it was in effect. Some anti-abortion activists have also argued that the federal government can use an existing law to implement a federal ban on abortion. The US supreme court has also dealt with two abortion cases so far this year \u2013 evidence that the issue is far from settled at the national level.\n\nThe environment\n\nThe claim: Trump had \u201cthe best environmental numbers ever\u201d.\n\nThe facts: It\u2019s not clear what \u201cenvironmental numbers\u201d Trump is referring to, making it impossible to factcheck. But the Guardian has compiled 75 ways Trump made the country dirtier and the climate warmer.\n\nPrescription drug reform\n\nThe claim: Biden oversold his prescription drug reforms.\n\nThe facts: Biden said seniors\u2019 out-of-pocket costs were capped at $200, but it\u2019s $2,000. The cap on insulin costs out of pocket are $35 a month, more than the $15 Biden claimed.\n\nThe border\n\nThe claim: Trump\u2019s border was the most secure in history.\n\nThe facts: Trump said that when he left the presidency, the US had the most secure border in history, and later said \u201chardly\u201d anyone was coming through.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The reasons people were seeking to migrate include economic stress caused by the pandemic and natural disasters, as well as long-running issues including violence and political instability.\n\nThe economy\n\nThe claim: Biden said the economy had \u201ccollapsed\u201d and there were no jobs when Trump left office.\n\nThe facts: That\u2019s a bit misleading \u2013 employment rates began to tick up pretty quickly after an initial dip at the beginning of the pandemic, before Biden took office.\n\nJanuary 6\n\nThe claim: Trump deflected a question about the January 6 insurrection, blaming Nancy Pelosi for turning down a chance to deploy the national guard.\n\nThe facts: This is false. There is no evidence Pelosi got an offer to deploy national guard troops, and even if she did, she wouldn\u2019t have the power to turn it down. The president, defense secretary and army secretary have command of the Washington DC national guard.\n\nTax cuts\n\nThe claim: Trump claimed his tax cuts were the largest in history and that his administration had the greatest economy in history.\n\nThe facts: His tax cut was the fourth-largest since 1940, according to PolitiFact. According to the non-profit Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget\u2019s recent report, Trump created about twice as much debt ($8.4tn) as Biden ($4.3tn). Before the pandemic hit, economic growth during his presidency averaged at about 2.7% \u2013 that\u2019s good but not as good as the 4% average growth during Bill Clinton\u2019s administration. Unemployment before the pandemic was as low as 3.5% \u2013 again, not as low as during Clinton\u2019s presidency.\n\n\u2018Superpredators\u2019\n\nThe claim: Trump said that Biden called Black Americans \u201csuperpredators\u201d.\n\nThe facts: The superpredator theory in the 1990s suggested that a growing number of unusually violent young people, especially Black boys, posed a threat to the country. The theory capitalized on racialized fear and was used to encourage policies that led to the disproportionate incarceration of Black youth. There is no evidence Biden used the phrase or ascribed to the theory behind it.\n\nHowever, Biden\u2019s endorsement of the 1994 crime bill has justifiably come under scrutiny. Biden has defended the bill, and said that aspects of it were wrongly implemented.",

        "text": "Understanding pro-climate voters in the United States\n2024 is a critically important election year for the climate, both in the U.S. and around the world. Many important federal climate policies, including the transition to clean energy, investments in underserved and more vulnerable communities, and participation in international climate treaties, will be determined by voters\u2019 choices in the 2024 elections. National polls find that Americans rank global warming as a lower policy priority than many other issues. However, these findings may underestimate support for action because a large number of Americans think that global warming is a very important voting issue, even if it is not at the very top of their list.\n\nUsing data from our latest Climate Change in the American Mind survey, we analyzed data from pro-climate voters, or registered voters in the U.S. who say both that global warming is a \u201cvery important\u201d issue to their vote for president and that they prefer to vote for candidates who support action on global warming.\n\nIn our survey, respondents first rated the importance of global warming and 27 other issues in terms of influencing their 2024 presidential vote (on a scale of \u201cvery important,\u201d \u201cmoderately important,\u201d \u201conly a little important,\u201d or \u201cnot at all important,\u201d which included a \u201cnot sure\u201d option). Later in the survey, they answered a different question about whether they preferred a candidate who supports or opposes action on global warming. We used their responses to these two questions to identify \u201cpro-climate voters\u201d as people who said both that global warming is a very important issue to their vote and that they prefer a candidate who supports action on global warming.\n\nJust over one-third (37%) of registered voters in the U.S. are pro-climate voters. Notably, an additional 25% of registered voters also prefer a candidate who supports climate action even though they do not say that global warming is a very important voting issue to them. Most other respondents indicated that climate change will not factor into their voting choices, but importantly, virtually no registered voters said that global warming was a very important issue and that they prefer a candidate who opposes action.\n\nLiberal Democrats are the group most likely to be pro-climate voters (70%), followed by urban residents (47%), Moderate/Conservative Democrats (47%), those with a Bachelor\u2019s degree or higher (45%), and Hispanics/Latinos (43%).\n\nSocial engagement among pro-climate voters\n\nWe found that pro-climate voters are more likely than all other voters to discuss global warming at least occasionally (67% vs. 19%), to hear about global warming in the media at least once per month (66% vs. 48%), to say that taking action on global warming is important to their family and friends (66% vs. 29%), to say that their family and friends make an effort to reduce global warming (62% vs. 24%), and to say that they hear other people about global warming at least once a month (40% vs. 15%).\n\nPolitical engagement among pro-climate voters\n\nIn 2022, the U.S. Congress passed, and President Biden signed, the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA. This law is the largest Congressional investment in climate action in U.S. history, and includes billions of dollars in investments in renewable energy, tax incentives for electric vehicle and home energy efficiency upgrades, as well as investments in rural economies and communities disproportionately affected by climate change.\n\nOur research since 2022 has found that relatively few voters have heard much about the IRA, although this number has been increasing over time. Here, we find that this trend persists even among pro-climate voters. Only about half of pro-climate voters say they have heard \u201csome\u201d or \u201ca lot\u201d about the IRA (47%), although the proportion is higher than all other voters (35%).\n\nAfter reading a short description of the IRA (refer to Methods section below), a majority of registered voters supported it. However, pro-climate voters supported the IRA much more strongly (97%) than other voters (61%).\n\nIn addition, we asked registered voters how likely they are to vote in the November 2024 presidential election. Pro-climate voters are more likely (89% \u201cvery likely\u201d and 7% \u201csomewhat likely\u201d) compared with other voters (82% \u201cvery likely\u201d and 9% \u201csomewhat likely\u201d).\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nA significant proportion of American registered voters (37%) are pro-climate voters. According to the most recent data available from the Census Bureau, there are more than 161 million registered voters in the United States. This suggests that there are nearly 60 million pro-climate voters in the U.S. Moreover, the great majority of these voters say they plan to vote in the 2024 presidential election. In a close election \u2013 as 2024 is expected to be \u2013 these voters could be decisive.\n\nOnly about half of pro-climate voters say they are familiar with the Inflation Reduction Act, but after reading a short description of it, nearly all pro-climate voters say they support it. Moreover, the Inflation Reduction Act has majority support even from voters who do not prioritize climate action.\n\nOur analysis finds that pro-climate voters are already more likely to talk about global warming compared with other voters, but only 40% say they hear other people they know talk about global warming. Additionally, our analysis finds that 25% of registered voters overall do not say that global warming is a very important issue to their vote, but they nonetheless prefer a candidate who supports action on global warming.\n\nFinally, although a large majority of pro-climate voters say they are likely to vote, not all of them are. Normative messages, such as letting people know that many people in their community are voting, including their own friends and family members, can encourage people to vote when they might not otherwise. Additionally, organizations like the Environmental Voter Project identify and engage low-likelihood voters who are concerned about environmental issues.\n\nMethods\n\nThe results of this report are based on data from the April 2024 wave (n = 1,031, including 896 registered voters) of the twice-yearly Climate Change in the American Mind survey \u2013 a nationally representative survey of U.S. public opinion on climate change conducted by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and the George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communication. Data were collected from April 25 \u2013 May 4, 2024, using the Ipsos KnowledgePanel\u00ae, a representative online panel of U.S. adults ages 18 and older. Questionnaires were self-administered online in a web-based environment.\n\nData were weighted to align with demographic parameters in the United States. Following Pew Research Center\u2019s approach, generational cohort and year of birth were calculated based on the age of respondents at the time of data collection (Gen Z: 1997-2012; Millennial: 1981-1996; Gen X: 1965-1980; Baby Boomer: 1946-1964; Silent Generation: 1928-1945). Because generational cohort classification was based on respondents\u2019 age at the time they took the survey (rather than birth year, which was not known), some respondents on the cusp of two generations may be miscategorized.\n\nAmong the subset of registered voters, references to Republicans and Democrats throughout include respondents who initially identify as either a Republican or Democrat, as well as those who do not initially identify as a Republican or Democrat but who say they \u201care closer to\u201d one of those parties (i.e., \u201cleaners\u201d) in a follow-up question. The category \u201cIndependents\u201d does not include any of these \u201cleaners.\u201d Independents and respondents who do not identify with a party or are not interested in politics are not included in this report.\n\nPro-climate voters were classified based on the responses to two questions, \u201cAs of today, how important will the following issues be to you when you decide who to vote for in the November 2024 Presidential election? [Global warming]?\u201d, and \u201cIf given a choice, would you prefer to vote for a candidate for public office who [opposes/supports] action on global warming or one who [supports/opposes] action on global warming?\u201d Respondents who said \u201cVery important\u201d for the first question and \u201cA candidate who supports action on global warming\u201d for the second question were classified as pro-climate voters, while all other respondents were classified as all other voters. Demographics for the two voter groups are presented in the data tables.\n\nIn figures/data tables, bases specified are unweighted, while percentages are weighted to match national population parameters. For tabulation purposes, percentage points are rounded to the nearest whole number.\n\nGroup differences were tested for statistical significance using the weighted proportions and unweighted sample sizes of each group. The average margin of error is +/- 3 percentage points at the 95% confidence interval for the full sample of U.S. adults (n = 1,031) and +/- 3.3 percentage points for the subset of registered voters who participated in the survey (n = 896). Average margins of error at the 95% confidence interval for the subgroups are:\n\nClimate Voter Status: Pro-climate voters +/- 5.3 percentage points (n = 336) All other voters +/- 4.1 percentage points (n = 560)\n\n\n\nDemographics: Black (non-Hispanic/Latino) +/- 11.0 percentage points (n = 79) Hispanic/Latino +/- 9.3 percentage points (n = 111) White (non-Hispanic/Latino) +/- 3.9 percentage points (n = 632) Earn less than $50,000 annually +/- 7.2 percentage points (n = 187) Earn $50,000-$99,999 annually +/- 6.2 percentage points (n = 247) Earn $100,000 or more annually +/- 4.6 percentage points (n = 462) Women +/- 4.6 percentage points (n = 448) Men +/- 4.6 percentage points (n = 448) Gen Z/Millennial +/- 5.7 percentage points (n = 294) Gen X +/- 6.4 percentage points (n = 239) Baby Boomer/Silent +/- 5.1 percentage points (n = 363) High school or less education +/- 6.1 percentage points (n = 253) Some college +/- 6.6 percentage points (n = 238) Bachelor\u2019s degree or higher +/- 4.9 percentage points (n = 405) Liberal Democrat +/- 6.4 percentage points (n = 234) Moderate/conservative Democrat +/- 7.1 percentage points (n = 188) Independent/No party +/- 8.3 percentage points (n = 138) Liberal/moderate Republican +/- 9.4 percentage points (n = 109) Conservative Republican +/- 6.6 percentage points (n = 221) Urban +/- 7.1 percentage points (n = 189) Suburban +/- 4.4 percentage points (n = 495) Rural +/- 6.8 percentage points (n = 207)\n\n\n\nThe question about support for the Inflation Reduction Act was administered after the question about awareness of it. After being asked about their awareness of the IRA, survey participants read the following description of the IRA: \u201cThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) aims to curb inflation by reducing the federal deficit, lowering prescription drug prices and the cost of health insurance, modernizing the Internal Revenue Service, and investing in U.S. clean energy production. The law authorizes $391 billion for developing clean energy and addressing global warming, including tax incentives and rebates to help consumers and businesses buy energy-efficient appliances, solar panels, electric vehicles, etc. The IRA also includes support for clean energy jobs and investments in communities that are most harmed by air and water pollution. It is the largest investment the U.S. government has ever made to reduce global warming, and is projected to help the U.S. reduce its carbon pollution 40% by 2030. The law will be paid for by closing tax loopholes.\u201d",

But many voters remain undecided, raising the stakes of a debate that will be viewed more for possible moments of drama than for policy discussions between the Democratic president and his Republican challenger.Trump refused to participate in the 2024 Republican primary debates, a decision that did him no harm as he easily beat all his rivals for the party's nomination. Biden also has not been on a debate stage in almost four years.CNN network, the first in history to earn sole broadcast rights for a presidential debate, offered competitors the chance to pick up its feed Thursday night, under certain conditions.The CNN logo would have to appear onscreen for the duration of the event, and any ads promoting it would have to refer to the \"CNN Presidential Debate,\" according to the Los Angeles Times.First 2024 presidential debate broadcast from Atlanta on CNN at 9 pm (ET) on Thursday, June 27.

        "text": "Trump vs Biden US Presidential Debate 2024 Highlights: Economy, climate issues, Ukraine and Israel wars feature in debate between Biden, Trump\nTrump vs Biden US Presidential Debate 2024 Live: What were some misleading claims made during the debate today?\n\nHere's a look at some of the false claims made during Biden and Trump's first debate:\n\nJANUARY 6 ATTACK\n\nTRUMP: \u201cThey talk about a relatively small number of people that went to the Capitol and in many cases were ushered in by the police.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: That's false. The attack on the US Capitol was the deadliest assault on the seat of American power in over 200 years. As thoroughly documented by video, photographs and people who were there, thousands of people descended on Capitol Hill in what became a brutal scene of hand-to-hand combat with police.In an internal memo on March 7, 2023, U.S. Capitol Police Chief J. Thomas Manger said that the allegation that \u201cour officers helped the rioters and acted as \u2018tour guides\u2019\u201d is \u201coutrageous and false.\u201d A Capitol Police spokesperson confirmed the memo\u2019s authenticity to The Associated Press. More than 1,400 people have been charged with federal crimes stemming from the riot. More than 850 people have pleaded guilty to crimes, and 200 others have been convicted at trial\n\nTAXES AND REGULATIONS\n\nTRUMP, on Biden: \u201cHe wants to raise your taxes by four times.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: That\u2019s not accurate.Trump has used that line at rallies, but it has no basis in fact. Biden actually wants to prevent tax increases on anyone making less than $400,000, which is the vast majority of taxpayers.More importantly, Biden\u2019s budget proposal does not increase taxes as much as Trump claims, though the increases are focused on corporations and the wealthy. Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts for individuals are set to expire after 2025, because they were not fully funded when they became law\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE\n\nTRUMP, touting his environmental record, said that \u201cduring my four years, I had the best environmental numbers ever\u201d and that he supports \u201cimmaculate\u201d air and water.\n\nTHE FACTS: That\u2019s far from the whole story. During his presidency, Trump rolled back some provisions of the Clean Water Act, eased regulations on coal, oil and gas companies and pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord. When wildfires struck California in 2020, Trump dismissed the scientific consensus that climate change had played a role. Trump also dismissed scientists\u2019 warnings about climate change and routinely proposed deep cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency. Those reductions were blocked by Democratic and Republican lawmakers.\n\nABORTION\n\nTRUMP: \u201cThe problem they have is they\u2019re radical because they will take the life of a child in the eighth month, the ninth month, and even after birth, after birth.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: Trump inaccurately referred to abortions after birth. Infanticide is criminalized in every state, and no state has passed a law that allows killing a baby after birth.Abortion rights advocates say terms like this and \u201clate-term abortions\u201d attempt to stigmatize abortions later in pregnancy. Abortions later in pregnancy are exceedingly rare. In 2020, less than 1% of abortions in the United States were performed at or after 21 weeks, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Abortions later in pregnancy also are usually the result of serious complications, such as fetal anomalies, that put the life of the woman or fetus at risk, medical experts say. In most cases, these are also wanted pregnancies, experts say\n\nCOVID-19\n\nBIDEN: Trump told Americans to \u201cinject bleach\u201d into their arms to treat COVID-19.\n\nTHE FACTS: That\u2019s overstating it. Rather, Trump asked whether it would be possible to inject disinfectant into the lungs.\u201cAnd then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in one minute,\u201d he said at an April 2020 press conference. \u201cAnd is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning, because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it\u2019d be interesting to check that, so that you\u2019re going to have to use medical doctors with, but it sounds interesting to me. So, we\u2019ll see, but the whole concept of the light, the way it kills it in one minute. That\u2019s pretty powerful.\u201d -- AP",

        "text": "How might the earliest presidential debate ever affect the election?\nHow might the earliest presidential debate ever affect the election?\n\nThe first presidential debate of the 2024 election will be the first ever to feature two former presidents, but that isn't the only thing that makes it unprecedented: It's also the earliest general election debate ever.\n\nWhen President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump take the stage at the CNN-hosted contest on Thursday -- it will be 131 days ahead of the Nov. 5 Election Day -- months ahead of the usual fall timeline.\n\nSince 1960, Debates have been sanctioned -- and scheduled -- by the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, with the previous earliest one taking place when Ronald Reagan faced off against Independent candidate John Anderson during the 1980 election cycle. That occurred on Sept. 21, 44 days ahead of that year's general election.\n\nSince 1976, the average length of time between the first general election debate and election date has been about 35 days, according to CPD records. The shortest interval was in 1992, when there were only 23 days between a debate an Election Day -- when Democrat Bill Clinton debated Republican George H. W. Bush.\n\nBen Starett, lighting programmer for CNN, sets up lights in the spin room for the presidential debate between President Joe Biden and Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump in Atlanta, June 26, 2024. Gerald Herbert/AP\n\nBiden and Trump will have about three extra months on the campaign trail following their first public faceoff -- and experts ABC News spoke with said the early timing could have a significant impact on the race.\n\n\"The combination of having so many people with doubts about both candidates, coupled with the first debate occurring before either convention, heightens its potential importance,\" said Republican political strategist Whit Ayres. \"I don't know that it will be actually important. But it certainly heightens the potential for importance.\"\n\nBut Mitchell McKinney, a professor at the University of Akron and noted political communication scholar, took a different view, predicting that this early debate may not matter as much.\n\nFirst, he said, at this stage in the cycle, voters aren't as tuned in as they would be in early fall, when the debates are usually held.\n\n\"Our most recent general election presidential debates, which typically occur in late September into October, have continued to be big draws, as in 75 to 80 million\" viewers, said McKinney. This time around, he continued, \"It could be half that.\"\n\nThe New York Times has reported that TV industry observers expect the debate to draw between 30 and 70 million viewers. For comparison, the first debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump -- in September 2016 \u2014 topped 84 million viewers, according to Nielsen ratings.\n\nIn this Sept. 29, 2020 file photo people watch the first presidential debate between President Donald J. Trump and Former Vice President Joe Biden, on in Hoboken, N.J. Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images, FILE\n\nSecond, regardless of whether CNN's debate exceeds ratings expectations Thursday night, the extra months between the first debate and election debate allow the candidates time to recover from a poor performance.\n\n\"If there is for a candidate -- one or both of these candidates -- some sort of gaffe or blunder,\" McKinney said, \"there is plenty of time for other events to take over ... the candidate or candidates can recover,\" he added.\n\nBut with Biden and Trump barreling toward a November rematch that voters are broadly unenthusiastic about, veteran Democratic strategist James Carville told ABC News that any new information about the two presidents on debate stage could make a difference for some key voters.\n\n\"People's attitudes are very fixed and voters tend to be pretty entrenched. The person that 'wins' -- I don't know how you determine that -- in this debate is going to be the one that provides voters with some new information, something they thought about before,\" said Carville, who ran Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign.\n\n\"I guess this seems to be pretty, kind of hard to move a lot of people in this election, but if you move a few, it makes a big difference,\" he added.\n\nThe decision to move up the timing followed disputes between the campaigns and the Committee on Presidential Debates -- partially over scheduling.\n\nBefore the Biden and Trump campaigns declared their participation in a non-Commission for Presidential Debates-sanctioned broadcast, the candidates were planning on appearing on stage for the first time together this fall, on Sept. 16.\n\nThe Trump campaign urged the commission in May to move up its debate schedule, arguing that early voting would have already begun in some places by the time Trump and Biden debated at that date.\n\n\"As it always does, the CPD considered multiple factors in selecting debate dates in order to make them accessible by the American public. These factors include religious and federal holidays, early voting, and the dates on which individual states close their ballots,\" the commission wrote in a statement.",

        "text": "Front-runners emerge in contest for Trump vice president\nFormer President Donald Trump has not yet announced the identity of his vice presidential running mate, but media reports and hints from the Trump campaign suggest he could do so between now and the Republican nominating convention in late July.\n\nWhile Trump could certainly make an unexpected decision, most reports suggest he has narrowed his search to about five potential running mates. The top three include two sitting U.S. senators \u2014 Marco Rubio and J.D. Vance \u2014 and one sitting governor: Doug Burgum of North Dakota.\n\nAlso said to be under consideration are Senator Tim Scott and Representative Elise Stefanik.\n\nThe potential nominees would bring different backgrounds and strengths to the Republican presidential ticket. Some had been harshly critical of Trump, only to fall in line after the Republican base coalesced behind him as the party's nominee in the 2016 presidential elections.\n\nThe choice is an important one for the Trump campaign, said William A. Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\n\"The political imperative is the political version of the Hippocratic oath: Do no harm,\" Galston told VOA. \"Because if you pick someone whose flaws come out quickly after the announcement, you will pay a big political price.\"\n\nStrategic choices\n\nOther strategic choices \u2014 beyond ensuring the nominee will not damage the campaign \u2014 have helped guide the choice of vice presidential candidates in the past.\n\nSometimes the pick is used to \"heal a breach\" between two factions of the president's party. Galston pointed out that the most serious breach in the Republican Party is between Trump supporters and voters who preferred former Governor Nikki Haley in the Republican primary. Trump appears to not have spoken to her after she dropped out, and healing that rift does not appear to be his priority.\n\nSometimes nominees will select close ideological partners who echo their policy choices. Or they will choose governing partners \u2014 steady, experienced leaders who add an aura of competence to the ticket. And some choose running mates who appeal to a portion of the voting public that the nominee might otherwise struggle to reach.\n\nFirst-generation American\n\nOf the top three candidates, Rubio is the most well known in Washington. An attorney, he has served in government at the municipal, state and national levels for more than 25 years, the last 13 of them in the Senate. He is vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee and served as chair when Republicans controlled the Senate.\n\nAt 53, Rubio is married and has four children. He is a Miami native and the son of immigrants who came to the United States from Cuba before that country's communist revolution. He is generally hawkish on matters of national security.\n\nAs a candidate in the 2016 Republican presidential primary, Rubio was an acerbic critic of Trump, whom he described as a \"con artist\" and an \"embarrassment.\" He has since become one of the former president's staunchest supporters in Congress.\n\n\"Rubio is certainly the best known, and he actually brings more to the table than [Vance and Burgum],\" Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, told VOA. \"How much he brings, we'll have to see, but he's a Spanish speaker. He is Cuban American. And Latinos have been to some degree slipping away from Democrats.\"\n\nEffective messenger\n\nVance is the least experienced in politics, having served in the Senate since January 2023 and having held no elective office prior to that. A native of Ohio, he is 39, married and has three children. He enlisted in the Marine Corps after high school and served in the Iraq War before earning a bachelor's degree and a law degree.\n\nVance first gained public notice in 2016 when he published his bestselling book, \"Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis,\" which analyzed the culture and social pathologies of America's Rust Belt. Vance later became a venture capitalist before running for the Senate in 2022.\n\nVance was also a harsh critic of Trump in the former president's early years in politics, once describing himself as a \"Never Trump\" Republican and referring to Trump as \"cultural heroin.\"\n\nLike Rubio, he also became a vocal supporter of Trump after the former president successfully took over the Republican Party.\n\nGalston of Brookings said Vance doesn't bring an obvious electoral benefit to the ticket, as his home state is already very likely to vote for Trump.\n\nHowever, he said, \"Vance would be an effective messenger of the Trump message, although Vance is smart enough that he would commit the occasional mistake of thinking for himself. From time to time there might be some friction, but it wouldn't last.\"\n\nQuiet competence\n\nBurgum, 67, is a North Dakota native and has served two terms as governor of the state, from late 2016 to the present. He has indicated he will not seek a third. He has three children from his first marriage that ended in 2003. He remarried in 2016.\n\nA wealthy businessman, Burgum has built several successful companies, including an accounting software firm that he sold to Microsoft for more than $1 billion in 2001. He has since been active in many philanthropic endeavors.\n\nBurgum was a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024 but dropped out of the race in December 2023. Although he was mildly critical of Trump during the campaign, he endorsed the former president early in the election year and went on to be a regular presence on the campaign trail and a media surrogate for him.\n\n\"Trump likes him and feels comfortable with him,\" said Sabato. \"He's a business guy, and he's very soft-spoken, has no pizzazz and can't possibly upstage Trump when they're on the stage together.\"\n\nOther possibilities\n\nWhile Rubio, Vance and Burgum appear to have the strongest chances right now, Scott and Stefanik are believed to remain under consideration.\n\nScott, the senator from South Carolina, has been in public office since 1995, when he started his career in local politics. He has been a senator since 2013 and served one term in the House of Representatives before that.\n\nAs an African American, Scott might help Trump appeal to Black Americans, a demographic where he has historically underperformed. Trump, however, is already highly favored to win in South Carolina, so choosing Scott would offer him little benefit there.\n\nStefanik has represented her New York district in the House since 2015 and is chair of the House Republican Conference, a position in the party's leadership. She is an outspoken Trump supporter who came to the former president's attention in part because of her aggressive defense of him when the House of Representatives was considering his first impeachment.\n\nAs a woman, Stefanik might help Trump appeal to female voters, with whom the former president has sometimes struggled. As with Scott, however, her selection would be unlikely to affect how her own state votes. New York has not voted for a Republican for president in 40 years, and 61% of its voters backed Joe Biden in 2020, while 38% backed Trump.",

        "text": "Age, Issues Working to Trump's Advantage Pre-Debate\nWASHINGTON, D.C. -- Heading into the first debate of the 2024 presidential campaign some four months before Election Day, Donald Trump is viewed more positively than President Joe Biden across a range of measures, though neither candidate has a favorable image overall. Part of Trump\u2019s advantage stems from the much more positive reviews the former president receives from his own party faithful than Biden receives from his.\n\nThese findings are from a June 3-23 Gallup poll that began several days after Trump was convicted of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in New York.\n\nThe poll finds that about twice as many Republicans are pleased with Trump being the GOP nominee as Democrats are with Biden leading their party\u2019s ticket.\n\nOverall, less than half of Americans view either candidate favorably, think either has the personality and leadership qualities a president should have, and say they agree with either on the issues that are most important to them.\n\nWhile Biden and Trump -- the two oldest major party candidates to seek the U.S. presidency -- are separated by just three years in age, Americans perceive Biden\u2019s advanced age as a far greater liability. Biden is also viewed as too liberal by a majority of Americans, whereas public opinion of Trump\u2019s ideology is mixed.\n\nRepublicans More Pleased Than Democrats With Their Party\u2019s Nominee\n\nRepublicans (79%) are nearly twice as likely as Democrats (42%) to say they are pleased with their party\u2019s nominee. A majority of Democrats (56%) would prefer another candidate.\n\nIn the summer of 2020, when Trump and Biden first ran against each other, Republicans\u2019 views of Trump were similar to how they are now. Democrats were more positive about Biden four years ago, with 56% satisfied, though they were still far less positive about him than Republicans were about Trump.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nGallup has not regularly tracked this sentiment, but several readings provide some context for the latest findings. After Hillary Clinton secured the nomination at the Democratic National Convention in 2016, 64% of Democrats said they were pleased she was their candidate. In a similar question that asked if partisans were \u201csatisfied\u201d (rather than \u201cpleased\u201d) with their party\u2019s nominee in 2012, 84% of Democrats were satisfied with Barack Obama, who was running as an incumbent.\n\nOn the Republican side, 45% of Republicans were pleased with Trump in 2016 after the GOP convention, and 66% were satisfied with Mitt Romney when he became their party's presumptive nominee in 2012.\n\nTrump\u2019s Favorability Is Up, Biden\u2019s Is Down\n\nBoth Biden and Trump are viewed unfavorably by majorities of Americans, but Trump\u2019s favorability shows improvement, while Biden\u2019s has worsened. Trump\u2019s favorable rating (46%) has increased by four percentage points since the prior reading in December and is the highest for him since April 2020. At the same time, Biden\u2019s favorable rating has dipped by the same four-point margin to 37%, his lowest since 2007, when he was unknown to many Americans.\n\nLeading up to the 2020 election, Biden\u2019s and Trump\u2019s favorable ratings were no more than four points apart, and more recently, in two 2023 readings, the ratings of the two men were tied. Similarly, in May, Gallup\u2019s \u201cscalometer\u201d measure found Biden and Trump tied in favorability.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nIndependent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is viewed favorably by 38% of Americans, which is 14 points lower than his prior rating in December. Kennedy\u2019s favorability dropped the most among Democrats (-26 points) and independents (-13 points) and the least among Republicans (-7 points).\n\nRepublicans offer a more positive assessment of their party\u2019s candidate than Democrats do -- 91% of Republicans view Trump favorably, and 81% of Democrats view Biden favorably. Independents view Trump and Kennedy more favorably than Biden.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nTrump Edges Out Biden as Having Presidential Personality and Leadership\n\nLess than half of Americans view Biden or Trump as having the personality and leadership qualities a president needs. The 46% of U.S. adults who think Trump possesses these traits includes 87% of Republicans, 43% of independents and 10% of Democrats.\n\nFewer Americans, 38%, think Biden possesses such personality and leadership qualities. Eighty-one percent of Democrats, 35% of independents and 4% of Republicans believe Biden embodies these characteristics.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nIn October 2019, as Trump sought reelection, 38% of Americans said he had the personality and leadership qualities a president needs. At that time, the public was evenly divided over whether Biden possessed these traits, with 49% saying he did.\n\nSix in 10 Americans Disagree With Biden on Key Issues\n\nAmericans are evenly divided over whether they agree or disagree with Trump on the issues that matter most to them, with 49% taking each position. When it comes to their agreement with Biden\u2019s stances on the issues they value most, 37% of U.S. adults say they agree with him, while 61% disagree.\n\nMore than nine in 10 Republicans, 93%, agree with Trump on key issues, while 81% of Democrats say the same of Biden. Independents are more aligned with Trump (46%) than Biden (34%) on issues.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nBiden\u2019s Age Is a Bigger Liability Than Trump\u2019s\n\nAt 81, Biden is three years older than Trump, who turned 78 this month. Despite their similar ages, Americans are nearly twice as likely to say Biden is too old to be president (67%) as say this about Trump (37%). These results are in line with prior Gallup polling showing that 31% of Americans are willing to vote for a presidential candidate over age 80 and 63% are willing to vote for a candidate over age 70.\n\nHalf of respondents polled in the June survey were asked whether each candidate is too old to be president; the other half of respondents were asked if they are concerned that each candidate is too old to be president. The results are similar, with 59% \u201cvery concerned\u201d about Biden\u2019s age versus 18% about Trump\u2019s. When factoring in those who are \u201csomewhat concerned,\u201d a combined 76% are concerned Biden is too old for the job, while 38% are concerned about Trump.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nBiden\u2019s age is not just a potential liability among Republicans and independents -- majorities of whom say he is too old and are very concerned about it -- but also among a sizable minority of Democrats. Forty-four percent of Democrats say Biden is too old, and 31% are very worried about it.\n\nPrior to Trump (age 70 in 2017) and Biden (age 78 in 2021), the oldest president had been Ronald Reagan, who was 69 at the start of his presidency in 1981 and 77 when he left office in 1989.\n\nMajority See Biden as Too Liberal, Fewer Say Trump Is Too Conservative\n\nWhen asked to characterize the candidates\u2019 political ideology, Americans largely say Biden is too liberal. Fifty-six percent see him this way, three in 10 say his views are about right, and 9% consider him too conservative.\n\nBy contrast, a 44% plurality of Americans think Trump is too conservative, 38% say his views are about right, and 10% say he is too liberal.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nThis is the first time Gallup has measured public perceptions of Biden\u2019s ideology, but the second for Trump. The first was measured in 2019, about halfway through Trump\u2019s presidency. At that time, the public was evenly divided between seeing him as too conservative (39%) and about right (38%), while 17% thought he was too liberal.\n\nMost partisans say their presidential candidate\u2019s views are about right, but more Republicans feel this way about Trump (78%) than Democrats do about Biden (69%).\n\nPolitical independents are also more likely to characterize Trump\u2019s politics as about right than Biden\u2019s, at 34% and 25%, respectively. The majority of independents (56%) think Biden is too liberal, while 43% say Trump is too conservative.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nBottom Line\n\nWith both candidates well-known to Americans, the stakes are high ahead of the first presidential debate of 2024, as Biden and Trump both have to overcome significant obstacles with the public. Biden appears to be at a bigger disadvantage ahead of the debate as his approval rating has been stagnating at a historically weak 38% and his favorable rating has now fallen to the same level.\n\nAmericans believe they are less aligned with Biden than Trump on the issues they view as most important and on their political ideology. Although the candidates are close in age, Biden\u2019s age is more of a barrier for voters than Trump\u2019s, and the debate will be a key moment for him to prove to a large national audience that he is up to the job of being president at an advanced age.\n\nAlthough Republicans are more united in their positivity about Trump than Democrats are about Biden, this may be partly due to the timing of the latest poll, which came on the heels of Trump\u2019s felony convictions and could have served to rally his supporters. Meanwhile, the campaign trail has not been kind to Kennedy, whose favorable rating has tumbled over the past six months, particularly among Democrats and independents. Kennedy did not qualify for the debate.\n\nThe race is far from over, with more than four months remaining until Election Day -- including the debates and both parties\u2019 national nominating conventions, which have the potential to shift Americans\u2019 views.\n\nTo stay up to date with the latest Gallup News insights and updates, follow us on X @Gallup.\n\nLearn more about how the Gallup Poll Social Series works.\n\nView complete question responses and trends (PDF download).\n\n###Embeddable###",

        "text": "You may hear Project 2025 during the U.S. presidential election campaign. What is it?\nU.S. voters will decide in November which president \u2014 the current one or the former one \u2014 will run the country for the next four years. Each must sell their vision for the presidency and dissect the other's. And that's how you're likely going to hear about something referred to as Project 2025.\n\nProject 2025: A Presidential Transition Project is a conservative vision and policy plan to dramatically reshape the U.S. government starting Jan. 20, 2025, inauguration day, assuming a conservative wins the White House in November.\n\nFormer president Donald Trump is set to become the official nominee at the Republican National Convention next month.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation, the influential group behind Project 2025, has laid out sweeping reforms of virtually every aspect of government, including a plan that critics warn will line the public service with employees loyal to a Republican commander-in-chief, as well as providing an ultra-conservative framework for policies.\n\nIts stated goal is to undo most everything implemented in the previous four years of U.S. President Joe Biden's administration.\n\n\"The actions of liberal politicians in Washington have created a desperate need and unique opportunity for conservatives to start undoing the damage the Left has wrought and build a better country for all Americans in 2025,\" the authors of its 920-page Mandate for Leadership document argue.\n\nTrump hasn't officially adopted the blueprint and promotes his own Agenda47 platform (because he would become the 47th president if re-elected). But the Biden campaign is seizing on concerns that Project 2025 is a recipe for authoritarianism and inextricable from his Republican rival's plan for power.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden, right, and former president Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, participate in the first presidential debate of the 2024 election, in Atlanta on June 27. (Gerald Herbert/The Associated Press)\n\nAlthough Biden didn't address Project 2025 in the first presidential debate, on June 27, as he was expected to do, his campaign launched a website that same day claiming it's a \"plan by Donald Trump's MAGA Republican allies to give Trump more power over your daily life, gut democratic checks and balances, and consolidate power in the Oval Office if he wins.\"\n\nHere's what you need to know about Project 2025 and who's behind it.\n\nWhat is the Heritage Foundation?\n\nThe Heritage Foundation is a Washington, D.C.-based think-tank that formulates and champions conservative policy proposals.\n\nIt has a long and proven history of shaping Republican policy-making dating back to the era of Ronald Reagan, who was president in the 1980s.\n\nIn his first year in office, Reagan implemented 60 per cent of the 2,000 proposals the Heritage Foundation published in its 1981 manifesto, also called Mandate for Leadership.\n\nIts influence persisted, though not to the same extent, after the Reagan years.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation claims to have influenced policy under the administrations of former president George H.W. Bush, Reagan's vice-president, and former president George W. Bush, as well as swaying House and Senate Republicans during Democratic administrations.\n\nWATCH | Breaking down Biden's debate performance and what it could mean for Democrats: Biden\u2019s debate performance: Was it really that bad? Duration 5:46 The National\u2019s Ian Hanomansing asks Washington Post columnist Philip Bump and CBC Washington correspondent Alex Panetta to break down Biden\u2019s debate performance and what it could mean for the Democrats.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation wasn't initially in Trump's corner when he announced his candidacy to be president in 2015, but according to Politico , it eventually became key to his transition team and claimed to have significantly influenced policy and appointments during his presidency.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation established the Project 2025 agenda in 2022, a year after Trump left office and Biden took the White House, and released the Mandate for Leadership the following year.\n\nWhat are some of the key goals of Project 2025?\n\nProject 2025 proposes a drastic overhaul of the U.S. government.\n\nIt calls for Congress to shutter the federal Department of Education and the \"top-to-bottom overhaul\" of the Department of Justice, particularly curbing its independence and ending FBI efforts to combat the spread of misinformation. Many other government agencies would also see their independence subverted.\n\nBut it's not just about departmental reforms.\n\nProject 2025, critics say, aims to root out thousands of federal government employees who aren't loyal to the president by reinstituting a Trump executive order from 2020 that would allow for the reclassification of many public service workers and strip them of job protections.\n\nThe Associated Press reported this week that the Heritage Foundation provided a $100,000 US grant to a group called the American Accountability Foundation that is investigating the backgrounds and social media posts of federal employees suspected of being hostile to Trump policies.\n\nThe policy playbook also promotes a raft of measures to combat what the authors describe as \"wokeism\" in the federal government, with the intent of eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and guidance.\n\nWATCH | How a Supreme Court ruling grants presidents immunity from prosecution: What the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling on immunity means for Donald Trump Duration 1:51 Analysts discuss what happens now that the U.S. Supreme Court has decided anything a president does in an official capacity is immune to prosecution.\n\nThe rights of the 2SLGBTQ+ community would be in a Republican-led administration's sights, if the Heritage Foundation has its way, as would restrictions on the medications used for abortions.\n\nThe document also suggests outlawing pornography and imprisoning anyone who produces or distributes it.\n\nClimate-change policies enacted under the Biden administration could also be reversed, according to the manifesto, with funding for efforts to develop renewable energy eliminated and fossil fuel production increased.\n\nWhat do critics say about Project 2025?\n\nThere has been growing attention and scrutiny on Project 2025's ambitions as the election looms.\n\nA recent segment on John Oliver's HBO show Last Week Tonight has accrued more than six million views on YouTube since it was posted on June 20, and Google searches for Project 2025 spiked earlier this month.\n\nDemonstrators with the Centre for Popular Democracy at a rally against the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, on Jan. 27 in Washington, D.C. (Joy Asico-Smith/The Associated Press for Centre for Popular Democracy)\n\nBut critics have been sounding the alarm about Project 2025 \u2014 even if it's only a proposal from a lobby group and not yet a doctrine or party policy.\n\nDemocratic House Rep. Jared Huffman told the Guardian newspaper that Project 2025 would be a \"wrecking ball\" for democracy.\n\nThe Centre for American Progress, which describes itself as a non-partisan policy institute, called it \"an authoritarian playbook\" and a \"far-right assault on America.\"\n\n\"[It] would destroy our system of checks and balances and give far-right politicians, judges, and corporations more control over Americans' lives,\" the organization said on its website.\n\nWATCH | Critical debate moments that may have lost Biden the debate \u2014 and possibly his base: The exact moment Biden lost the debate | About That Duration 13:08 U.S. President Joe Biden's performance during the first presidential debate against Donald Trump of the 2024 election campaign has raised questions from supporters and critics alike about whether Biden should withdraw from the race. Andrew Chang zeroes in on the critical moments that may have lost Biden the debate \u2014 and possibly his base.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation has dismissed such claims as \"the Left's extreme fearmongering.\"\n\nIn a recent interview on MSNBC , Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts insisted his organization was non-partisan and claimed the Biden campaign declined a briefing on Project 2025's Mandate for Leadership.\n\nBut he also said the Heritage Foundation aims to \"institutionalize Trumpism,\" which it views as the \"new version of conservatism.\"",

BoothRelated Topics2024 Presidential ElectionRelated CapabilitiesInternational TradeEnvironmentalEnvironmental Litigation & EnforcementHealth CareGovernment Contracts & GrantsJuly 10, 2024Following the June 27, 2024, Presidential Debate, our team compiled a list of key takeaways focusing on the presidential candidates\u2019 policy positions.\nJoe Biden\nENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES\n\nPresident Biden highlighted his support of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which the President said represented \u201cthe most extensive climate change legislation in history, in history.\u201d\nAccording to the White House, the Inflation Reduction Act \u201chas already spurred [as of February 2024] a clean energy boom, contributing to more than $360 billion in private sector clean energy announcements since President Biden took office.\u201d\nBiden criticizes Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the \u201cParis Peace Accord \u2013 Climate Accord,\u201d which Biden \u201cimmediately rejoined\u201d again after taking office.\nBiden stressed \u201cThe only existential threat to humanity is climate change,\u201d and that Trump \u201cwants to undo all that I\u2019ve done.\u201d\nBiden also highlighted the establishment of \u201ca Climate Corps for thousands of young people\u201d to \u201clearn how to deal with climate, just like the Peace Corps.\u201d\n\nGOVERNMENT CONTRACTS & NATIONAL SECURITY\n\nOn the war in Ukraine, President Biden emphasized the need to continue to support Ukraine by supplying weaponry (as opposed to cash). He noted that Putin was a war criminal. He also emphasized the need to support NATO and to address the potential for Russia\u2019s invasion of a NATO country.\nOn October 7 and the hostages, Biden says he has promoted a three-point plan which includes (1) trading hostages for a cease fire, (2) implementing the cease fire, and (3) engaging in reconstruction.\nOn the border and the fentanyl crisis, Biden addressed more security at the border and used the fentanyl screening machines as an example. He also mentioned the work that Mexico has committed to carrying out with respect to stopping fentanyl production.\n\nHEALTH CARE\n\nPresident Biden emphasized his administration\u2019s efforts to lower prescription drug pricing, highlighting the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s caps on the cost of insulin.\nBiden stated that restoring and protecting access to reproductive healthcare is a goal of his administration and expressed opposition to determining reproductive rights on a state-by-state basis.\nBiden expressed continued support for the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\nBiden expressed a desire to protect Medicare and stated he would reduce healthcare costs for seniors by raising taxes on the income of citizens with income above $400,000 per year.\n\n\nDonald Trump\nENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES\n\nFormer President Trump said he wants \u201cabsolutely immaculate clean water and I want absolutely clean air, and we had it. We had H2O. We had the best numbers ever.\u201d\nAt the same time, Trump emphasized the use of \u201call forms of energy, all forms, everything\u201d during his Administration.\nTrump stood by his decision to withdraw from \u201cthe Paris Accord,\u201d stating it \u201cwas going to cost us a trillion dollars, and China nothing, and Russia nothing, and India nothing. It was a ripoff of the United States.\u201d\nTrump did not respond to Biden\u2019s claim that a new Trump administration would seek to stop the clean energy subsidies implemented by the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nGOVERNMENT CONTRACTS & NATIONAL SECURITY\n\nFormer President Trump expressed that China will be a focus for additional tariffs in order to reduce the trade deficit and create a more even playing field for trading partners.\nOn immigration, Trump has promised to close the border and to begin deporting immigrants who entered the country illegally. Tied in with the immigration crisis, Trump also addressed the fentanyl crisis.\nOn Iran, Trump would re-focus an aggressive foreign policy on reducing access to funds. Trump identifies Iran as a destabilizing force in the world and identified October 7, Yemen, Syria, and the Red Sea as examples.\nOn the war in Ukraine, Trump has said that ending the war should be a primary focus of European states and less a U.S. focus given geographic proximity of the former. Related to Ukraine, Trump referenced the WSJ reporter who has been held in the Russian Federation and proposed that he would work to obtain his release before inauguration day.\n\nHEALTH CARE\n\nTrump did not directly call for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) during the debate.\n\n\nWe will continuously monitor and provide updates on the 2024 Presidential Debates, delivering insights on four critical regulatory areas: government contracts and national security, energy and environmental issues, technology and artificial intelligence, and health care.

        "text": "'Babbling' and 'hoarse': Biden's debate performance sends Democrats into a panic\nATLANTA \u2014 President Joe Biden was supposed to put the nation\u2019s mind at ease over his physical and mental capacity with his debate showing Thursday night.\n\nBut from the onset of the debate, Biden, 81, seemingly struggled even to talk, mostly summoning a weak, raspy voice. In the opening minutes, he repeatedly tripped over his words, misspoke and lost his train of thought.\n\nIn one of the most notable moments, Biden ended a rambling statement that lacked focus by saying, \u201cWe finally beat Medicare,\u201d before moderators cut him off and transitioned back to former President Donald Trump.\n\nWhile Biden warmed up and gained more of a rhythm as the debate progressed, he struggled to land a punch against Trump, much less fact-check everything Trump said as he unleashed a torrent of bad information.\n\nTrump also pounced on Biden, saying at one point that he didn\u2019t understand what Biden had just said with regard to the border.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if he knows what he said, either,\u201d Trump said.\n\nNearly an hour into the debate, a Biden aide and others familiar with his situation offered up an explanation for his hoarseness: He has a cold.\n\nBut there were problems aside from the shakiness of Biden's voice. When he wasn't talking, he often stared off into the distance. Trump frequently steamrolled over Biden, accusing him of being a criminal and of peddling misinformation \u2014 many times without a response from Biden, though he did fire back with a handful of one-liners throughout.\n\nThe Biden campaign acknowledged that the debate would be a critical moment in the election, with officials hoping it could shake up the race to his benefit. Most polls have found the race to be neck and neck, with razor-thin margins that have moved negligibly for months, even after a New York jury found Trump guilty on 34 felony counts.\n\nQuestions about Biden\u2019s age and frailty have dragged down his polling numbers for months. The public concerns are exacerbated by deceptively edited videos, some of which have gone viral, that cut off relevant parts of an event, making it appear as if Biden is wandering or confused. This was Biden\u2019s first opportunity since the State of the Union speech to dispel that narrative.\n\nInstead of a new beginning, many Democrats saw it as a moment for panic.\n\n\u201cDemocrats just committed collective suicide,\u201d said a party strategist who has worked on presidential campaigns. \u201cBiden sounds hoarse, looks tired and is babbling. He is reaffirming everything voters already perceived. President Biden can\u2019t win. This debate is a nail in the political coffin.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to argue that we shouldn\u2019t nominate someone else,\u201d a Democratic consultant who works on down-ballot races said.\n\nBiden did ramp up as the debate progressed.\n\n\u201cOnly one of us is a convicted felon, and I\u2019m looking at him,\u201d Biden said to Trump. That was one moment that tested particularly well in the Biden campaign's internal real-time polling at the time of the debate, according to a person familiar with the polling.\n\nAn aide said that it was \u201cnot an ideal start\u201d for Biden at the beginning of the debate but that there was \u201cno mass panic\u201d at the campaign headquarters in Delaware.\n\nThe muting of the candidates' microphones at the debate, a stipulation both campaigns agreed to before the debate, added a new dimension to the faceoff. The first Biden-Trump match-up in 2020 was marked by repeated interruptions by Trump, leading to moments of frustration for Biden.\n\n\u201cWill you shut up, man?\u201d Biden complained at that first Cleveland debate.\n\nReaction pours in\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking the Democrats are thinking about who the Barry Goldwater is who can walk in tomorrow and tell the president he needs to step aside,\u201d said Ben Proto, chairman of the Connecticut Republican Party.\n\nIn 1974, after key Watergate tapes were made public, Sen. Barry Goldwater, R-Ariz., went to see President Richard Nixon alongside other prominent lawmakers, telling Nixon that he would be convicted by the Senate and that he should step aside \u2014 which he did.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign defended his performance, saying he offered a \u201cpositive and winning vision\u201d for America.\n\n\u201cOn the other side of the stage was Donald Trump, who offered a dark and backwards window into what America will look like if he steps foot back in the White House: a country where women are forced to beg for the health care they need to stay alive. A country that puts the interests of billionaires over working people,\u201d Biden campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon said in a statement. \u201cAnd a former president who not once, not twice, but three times, failed to promise he would accept the results of a free and fair election this November.\u201d\n\nSome Democrats also defended Biden presidency more broadly after the debate, pointing to his policies over Trump's.\n\n\"One thing this debate won\u2019t change is Trump\u2019s base instinct to sell out anyone to make a quick buck or put his own image on a steak, golf course or even the Holy Bible,\" said Brandon Weathersby, a spokesman with the pro-Biden American Bridge 21st Century super PAC. \"Trump puts himself first every time, and that won\u2019t change if he becomes president again.\"\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has fended off his own questions over whether he\u2019s diminished by age, including his struggles to stay on topic and his meandering when he\u2019s speaking. Biden has posited that Trump \u201csnapped\u201d after his 2020 election loss and is unstable, which he aired again Thursday night.\n\nTrump often gave his typical rambling responses and seemed at times to make up factoids and figures.\n\n\u201cDuring my four years, I had the best environmental numbers ever, and my top environmental people gave me that statistic just before I walked on the stage, actually,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump also said he would lower insulin prices for seniors, but it was Biden who signed legislation in 2022 that lowered out-of-pocket costs for people on Medicare to $35 a month and covered all insulin products.\n\nSetting the stage for the fall\n\nThe first debate during the 2020 election cycle was in early September, meaning the first 2024 general election debate was significantly earlier than usual \u2014 more than two months ahead of Labor Day, which is often seen as the point when most voters start to pay attention to presidential contests.\n\n\u201cDebates move numbers,\u201d said Matt Gorman, a longtime Republican strategist who worked for presidential campaign of Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina. \u201cAnd with this so early \u2014 and the next one not until September \u2014 you\u2019re stuck with the narrative for four long months.\n\n\u201cAnd one and the other\u2019s performance will set the tone for the next one,\u201d he added.\n\nFor months, Trump\u2019s team has been hammering Biden\u2019s mental acuity, a strategy that is at odds with how campaigns generally handle the lead-up to debates, when they try to build up opponents as deft debaters to set expectations.\n\nThe expectations for Biden were low, and by almost all estimates he was unable to clear them.\n\n\u201cBiden just had to beat himself; unfortunately the stumbling and diminished Joe Biden the world has come to know made Trump look competent and energetic,\u201d said a former Trump campaign official who isn\u2019t working for his campaign this year. \u201cI expect there will be some loud calls from Democrats for a change on the top of the ticket.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe floor for Biden was so low,\u201d the person added. \u201cAfter Biden\u2019s debate performance, it seems the floor is 6 feet under.\u201d\n\nThe 90-minute debate hit on a wide variety of topics, but many of the most dominant themes were centered on those that have been most prominent on the campaign trail over the past few months.\n\nTrump hit Biden on two big policy fights that have stubbornly dogged his campaign: immigration and inflation.\n\nSince Biden took office, 15 million jobs have been created and the unemployment rate sits at a relatively low 4%, but prices for consumer goods have remained high, and they provided a consistent line of attack from the Trump campaign and Republicans more broadly.\n\nIn one heated exchange, Trump point-blank said \u201che caused the inflation.\u201d Biden said in response there was less inflation under Trump because he tanked the economy.\n\n\u201cThere was no inflation when I came into office,\u201d Biden said before that rejoinder \u2014 a quote Republicans quickly used as evidence that all of the current price hikes happened on Biden\u2019s watch.\n\nTrump continued to attack Biden over his border policies, which his campaign has used as one of its biggest lines of attack throughout the campaign. That often including amplifying each time an undocumented migrant commits a crime even though the data doesn\u2019t support the idea of a migrant crime wave.\n\n\u201cWe have a border that is the most dangerous place anywhere in the world,\u201d Trump said.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump used his influence over congressional Republicans to block a bipartisan border deal that Biden supported.\n\nBiden also tried to land a punch about Jan. 6, trying to build on the oft-discussed idea that Trump\u2019s returning to the White House would be a threat to democracy.\n\n\u201cHe encouraged those folks to go up to Capitol Hill,\u201d Biden said. \u201cHe sat there for three hours being begged by his vice president and many colleagues on the Republican side to do something.\u201d\n\nTrump deflected, arguing the Biden should be \u201cashamed\u201d for arresting those who participated in the attempted insurrection.",

The COVID-19 public health emergency is technically over. And the terms and format of the debate itself are brand new.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBiden and Trump agreed this spring to a pair of presidential debates hosted by TV networks in June and September, in a pointed departure from the traditional schedule and process of the Commission on Presidential Debates.\n\nThursday\u2019s is hosted by CNN at its Atlanta studio, without an in-person audience and governed by a new set of rules.\n\nThose include the addition of two commercial breaks, points out Mary Kate Cary, formerly a speechwriter for President George H.W. Bush.\n\n\u201cThey're not allowed to talk to their staff during the commercial breaks, and the microphones will be muted when the other person is speaking,\u201d Cary told NPR\u2019s Morning Edition. \u201cAnd I think that's going to be a big contrast to the last time these two had a first debate, in 2020.\u201d\n\nTheir first on-stage matchup in September 2020 was dominated by Trump\u2019s repeated interruptions and refusal to condemn white supremacists, and was widely criticized by viewers and commentators alike.\n\nOne COVID-canceled debate and some rule changes later, the two reunited for a final, less chaotic faceoff in October \u2014 at which point tens of millions of Americans had already cast their votes.\n\nWith Trump and Biden now near even in the latest polls, and many Americans unenthused \u2014 and still undecided \u2014 about voting for either of them, Thursday\u2019s debate offers both candidates an opportunity. But it\u2019s not without risks.\n\nIt\u2019s likely to be a memorable night if 2020 is any indication. Here\u2019s a look at what happened last time Trump and Biden took the stage together.\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\n1. Trump derailed the first debate\n\ntoggle caption Pool/Getty Images\n\nThe first round, in September 2020, was by many accounts a disaster. NPR\u2019s Domenico Montanaro called it \u201cmaybe the worst presidential debate in American history.\u201d\n\nTrump arrived on the debate stage trailing in the polls and, apparently, jonesing for drama. He interrupted Biden constantly, peppering him with questions and personal slights despite moderator Chris Wallace\u2019s pleas for order.\n\nAt one point, while Biden was talking about his late son Beau\u2019s military service, Trump jumped in to attack his other son, Hunter, for his drug use (which Biden managed to seize as a sympathetic moment).\n\nBiden tried in vain to ignore Trump talking over him throughout \u2014 but called the then-president a \u201cclown\u201d more than once. At one point he had clearly had enough.\n\n\u201cWill you shut up, man?\u201d he said exasperatedly, as Trump continued accusing him of wanting to pack the Supreme Court. \u201cThis is so unpresidential.\u201d\n\nTrump even bulldozed over Wallace, prompting the then-Fox News anchor to declare, \u201cMr. President, I am the moderator of this debate and I would like you to let me ask my question and then you can answer.\u201d\n\nStill, a few substantive moments stood out amidst the chaos and crosstalk.\n\nOne was when Wallace asked if Trump was willing to condemn white supremacists and tell them to \u201cstand down.\u201d\n\nTrump blamed the \u201cleft-wing\u201d instead, but said he was prepared to do so. At that point, both Wallace and Biden urged him to go ahead. Trump asked for a name, and Biden suggested the Proud Boys.\n\n\u201cProud Boys, stand back and stand by,\u201d Trump said, in what sounded more like a call to action, and quickly became part of the far-right extremist group\u2019s new social media logo.\n\nTrump also repeatedly made baseless claims about the upcoming election being rigged, saying \u201cThis is going to be fraud like you\u2019ve never heard.\u201d\n\nWhen Wallace asked if he would urge his supporters to stay calm during a potentially prolonged period of counting ballots, Trump demurred. He said instead that he was \u201curging my supporters to go into the polls and watch very carefully.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s a fair election, I am 100% on board,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if I see tens of thousands of ballots being manipulated, I can\u2019t go along with that.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nTrump was wrong about widespread fraud. But his other comments turned out to be a bit of foreshadowing, as the former president has since been charged with multiple felony counts for attempting to overturn the election and disrupt the peaceful transfer of power.\n\n\n\n2. The second debate was scrapped over COVID concerns\n\ntoggle caption Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n\nTheir next debate, scheduled for Oct. 15 in Miami, was scrapped altogether due to disagreement between the campaigns and the Commission on Presidential Debates over COVID-19 protocols.\n\nTrump refused to debate virtually after he was diagnosed with the virus himself.\n\nTrump announced on Oct. 2 that he and First Lady Melania Trump had tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nLater that day he was airlifted to Walter Reed, where he remained for the next three days, receiving experimental treatments as the country waited for updates and the White House seemingly struggled to explain the timeline of his previous exposures and public engagements.\n\nAt the time, questions were mounting about whether Trump had taken a test (as required by the debate commission's \"honor code\" system) \u2014 and gotten a positive result \u2014 before his first debate with Biden. It later became apparent that he had: His former Chief of Staff Mark Meadows wrote in his 2021 book that Trump tested positive for COVID-19 three days before that first debate.\n\nOn Oct, 8, the commission announced it would shift to a virtual debate due to health and safety concerns. Trump\u2019s team countered that he would be cleared for public events by then, saying there was \u201cno medical reason\u201d why the debate couldn\u2019t be held in person.\n\nTrump ultimately pulled out of the virtual debate, calling it \u201ca waste of time.\u201d\n\nAfter more back and forth (Trump\u2019s team proposed delaying the second and third debates by a week; Biden rejected that idea), the commission canceled the debate altogether, less than a week in advance.\n\nInstead, each candidate held individual town halls \u2014 Trump on NBC News, Biden on ABC News \u2014 on Oct. 15, both airing at the same time.\n\n\n\n3. The final debate was less dramatic\n\nTrump and Biden returned to the debate stage in Nashville on Oct. 22, less than two weeks before Election Day.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBy that point, more than 40 million Americans had already cast their votes by mail, Biden held a 10-point lead in an average of national polls and only a small sliver of voters appeared willing to be persuaded.\n\nThe debate proved much less dramatic than the first round, partly due to new rules that kept each candidate\u2019s microphone muted during the first two minutes of their opponent\u2019s speaking time, and the no-nonsense approach of moderator Kristen Welker of NBC News.\n\nMontanaro wrote, \u201cEven Biden appeared bored, and near the end of the debate checked his watch.\u201d\n\nBoth candidates were relatively restrained on the issues \u2014 COVID, healthcare and the economy.\n\nBut things got testy when the two sparred over personal finances. Trump claimed Biden made money from Russia, China and Ukraine, which Biden denied before blasting Trump for refusing to release his income tax returns.\n\nContinuing his line of attack, Trump sought to paint Biden as a typical (and corrupt) politician.\n\n\u201cI'm not a typical politician,\u201d Biden returned. \u201cThat's why I got elected.\u201d\n\n\n\n4. VP bonus round: Pence, Harris and a pesky fly\n\ntoggle caption Eric Baradat/AFP via Getty Images\n\nVice President Mike Pence and then-Sen. Kamala Harris squared off in a debate of their own in early October, during Trump\u2019s COVID convalescence and as the fate of the subsequent presidential debates hung in the balance.\n\nWhile the VP debate was never likely to shift the election, it highlighted sharp contrasts between Democrats\u2019 and Republicans\u2019 agendas on topics like the pandemic, health care and the economy.\n\nBoth candidates did their share of shirking follow-up questions, and Harris called out Pence \u2014 \u201cMr. Vice President, I\u2019m speaking\u201d \u2014 when he started to step on her time.\n\nThe most memorable takeaway, however, wasn\u2019t what the candidates did or did not say, but who else joined them onstage.\n\nA fly landed on Pence\u2019s white hair and lingered for a solid two minutes as he continued speaking, seemingly unaware. Within minutes of the debate's end, the Biden campaign tweeted out a fly-swatter-themed donation pitch.\n\nThis time, Trump has not yet announced his VP pick, though has done a lot of hinting that he knows who it will be.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Trump\u2019s eventual running mate will also wind up on the debate stage \u2014 but CBS News reported last month that Harris had accepted its invitation for a debate, either on July 23 or Aug. 13.",

There was no change for me personally who I will be supporting,\" Rabun said.\n\nHe's undecided whether he'll vote for Trump or Robert F Kennedy Jr in November.\n\nGloria Murphy, a staunch Trump supporter, said she learned \"not really much new\".\n\n\"Biden was terrible. Unfortunately he doesn't appear to have a real grasp on things.\"\n\nDeborah Scott, a lifelong Democrat, was also unmoved by last night.\n\n\"The debate did little to provide clarity on high priority issues that address the concerns of black women who will be a key constituency in deciding this election outcome,\" Scott said.\n\nPolls show President Biden is losing support from black voters who played an outsized role in helping him win in 2020. Black women, however, have seen the least fallout.\n\n\"The event missed the mark and was a lost opportunity,\" Scott said.",

I call it Biden migrant crime. They\u2019re killing our citizens at a level that we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nBiden repeatedly pointed out that many of Trump\u2019s claims were not true and attacked the former president over his convictions, his encouraging rioters to enter the Capitol building on Jan. 6, 2021 and the affair allegations against Trump from porn star Stormy Daniels.\n\n4:15 New polling shows Americans, Democrats beginning to sour on Biden\n\n\u201cThe idea that you have a right to seek retribution against any American just because you\u2019re president is wrong, is simply wrong,\u201d Biden said, referring to Trump saying he sought revenge against political foes if he returns to office.\n\nHere are the main flashpoints.\n\nConcerns over Biden\u2019s age\n\nModerator CNN\u2019s Dana Bash asked Biden, who will be 86 at the end of a second term if he were to win, how he would handle the world\u2019s toughest job.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201c(Trump) is three years younger and a lot less competent,\u201d Biden responded.\n\nBiden then pointed to his record, saying he has brought billions of dollars in investment to the U.S. for microchip production and created millions of jobs.\n\nTrump, when asked the same question, said he aced two cognitive tests used to detect early dementia.\n\n3:20 \u2018Biden Administration deserves another 4 years,\u2019 Maryland governor says following presidential debate\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in very good health,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cI just won two club championships, not even senior two regular club championships. To do that, you have to be quite smart and you have to be able to hit the ball a long way.\u201d\n\nThe two then debated who could hit a golf ball farther.\n\n1:56 Trump, Biden argue over who is the better golfer during presidential debate\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that either man actually did what was needed to convince the American people that either one of them should be president,\u201d political scientist and author Lara Brown told Global News.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nShe said the debate represented \u201cwhy so many Americans are distressed and despondent that these are their choices.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that what we saw was one president who was stuttering and stumbling over the truth and was presentationally-weak,\u201d she said of Biden, \u201cbut who was actually making reasonable arguments.\u201d\n\nShe said Trump was \u201ca strong, energetic and rhetorically, apparently coherent. And yet everything that he said was full of falsehoods.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s commitment to democracy\n\nIn a heated exchange over Trump\u2019s role on Jan. 6, when many Trump supporters stormed the Capitol building, Biden warned another Trump presidency could result in a \u201cbloodbath\u201d because the former president has downplayed his role, the role of many people now charged in the attempted insurrection and spoken about pardoning them.\n\nGet breaking National news For news impacting Canada and around the world, sign up for breaking news alerts delivered directly to you when they happen.

He\u2019s not a sucker. You\u2019re the sucker. You\u2019re the loser, President Trump,\u201d Biden said to Trump, citing reports that Trump called dead American soldiers \u201closers\u201d while visiting a war cemetery in Europe.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIt was the first salvo in what at time became very personal attacks.\n\nTrump claimed Biden encouraged Russia to invade Ukraine and, later, said Biden should go to jail for what he\u2019s done to the country.\n\n\u201cHis son is a convicted felon at a very high level,\u201d Trump said of Biden\u2019s son Hunter, who was just found guilty of charges relating to gun ownership.\n\n\u201cHis son is convicted, going to be convicted, probably numerous other times and should have been convicted before.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many billions of dollars do you owe, for civil penalties? For molesting a woman in public? \u2026of having sex with a porn star on the night \u2013 an incident while your wife was pregnant, right?\u201d Biden responded.\n\n\u201cYou have the morals of an alley cat.\u201d\n\nSeveral times Biden criticized Trump supporting white nationalists, either telling the Proud Boys to \u201cstand by\u201d in their previous debate four years ago or saying \u201cthere were good people on both sides\u201d after a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017.\n\nThen, Trump made the comment during a nationally televised speech. On Thursday night he said Biden \u201cmade up the Charlottesville story.\u201d\n\nBrown said she didn\u2019t think either candidate\u2019s attacks landed because they were expected.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nWhile Trump is a convicted felon over his attempts to falsify business records to conceal hush money payments over the Stormy Daniels matter, as a New York court determined, the attacks didn\u2019t land because they weren\u2019t original.\n\n\u201cAttacks, are best landed when they are unexpected or they are unanticipated, like humour,\u201d Brown said, speaking from Washington.\n\n\u201cWe have to have an element of surprise. And if there is nothing surprising about it, it doesn\u2019t sort of elicit a sense of memorability or outrage.\u201d\n\nAbortion\n\nTrump said he agreed with the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision not to ban mifepristone, a drug used in abortions, contradicting many lawmakers in the Republican party. But he also said states should have the power to decide whether a woman should be able to get the procedure \u2013 and he falsely claimed reintroducing Roe v. Wade allowed unrestricted late-term abortions.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cThat means (the doctor) can take the life of the baby in the ninth month and even after birth,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat is simply not true. That\u2014 Roe v Wade does not provide for that,\u201d Biden said, promising to reinstate the right to abortion.\n\nAbortion opponents who claim abortions take place after birth typically refer to a \u201cpartial birth abortion,\u201d which according to the Associated Press is a non-medical term for a procedure known as dilation and extraction, or D&X, which is already federally prohibited and has been for more than 15 years.\n\nLater term abortions are exceedingly rare \u2014 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say 93 per cent of abortions happen before 13 weeks of gestation, with six per cent happening between 14 and 20 weeks, and one per cent happening beyond 21 weeks.\n\n3:59 Kamala Harris takes aim at Trump on 2nd anniversary of controversial Roe v. Wade ruling\n\n\u201cNo politician should be making that decision. A doctor should be making those decisions,\u201d Biden said.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s comments, Brown said, \u201cdon\u2019t speak to what his party is willing to do\u201d on abortion.\n\nShe pointed out Biden was \u201csomewhat awkward\u201d on the topic because he is a devout Catholic, a religion that prohibits abortion.\n\nImmigration\n\nOne of the fiercest debated topics was immigration.\n\nTrump falsely saying many migrants are killing \u201chundreds of thousands of people\u201d and blamed Biden for their deaths.\n\nHe then said illegal migrants are \u201cliving in luxury hotels\u201d while veterans live on the streets.\n\n\u201cWe call it migrant crime. I call it Biden-migrant crime. They\u2019re killing our citizens at a level that we\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d Trump said, claiming Biden deliberately opened the border to allow crime to happen.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cEvery single thing he said is a lie, every single one,\u201d Biden responded at one point.\n\nBiden\u2019s White House did have a deal with Republicans on border security, with Trump later encouraging the GOP not to allow the bill through.\n\nBrown said Trump\u2019s party are now happy to be able to run on the polarizing issue in the campaign.\n\nAs to which candidate won more undecided voters\u2019 support, Brown said the vast majority of them likely didn\u2019t watch the debate.\n\n\u201cThey tune out political coverage. They\u2019re marginally interested,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAnd this is where what matters more than the debate itself is what the conversation will be about the debate later.\u201d\n\nShe told Global News both campaigns will likely by using clips from the contest, of their candidate doing well or the other slipping, in their social media campaigns.\n\n1:41 Biden limits asylum seekers at U.S.-Mexico border\n\nGiven that Biden\u2019s voice was raspy and he sometimes seemed unfocused while Trump was more energetic, she believes Biden will lose some undecided voters.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThursday\u2019s event was the earliest a televised debate has ever been held in a presidential election.\n\nBrown said it, like other debates, would likely yield short-term bumps in support, but many other events are still to come that could change people\u2019s minds \u2013 especially in a year when so many things are happening, like campus protests over the Middle East and elections in France and the United Kingdom.\n\n\u201cI think it becomes so, premature to decide because it seems as though, pretty much every week there is a new catastrophe, that gets blown up into this is going to be decisive in the race. And then two weeks later, it\u2019s almost forgotten or dismissed.\u201d",

(Selcuk Acar/Anadolu via Getty Images)\n\nWhat\u2019s happening\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. is running for president as an independent \u2014 and both Democrats and Republicans are worried that he could \u201cspoil\u201d the election by siphoning more votes from one side than the other.\n\nKennedy did not meet CNN's threshold \u2014 garnering 15% support in four reliable national polls by June 20 \u2014 to qualify for Thursday night's presidential debate.\n\nAt first, the thinking was that RFK Jr.'s candidacy posed a bigger threat to President Biden than to his Republican rival, former President Donald Trump.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nNewsletter: The Yodel Trusted news and daily delights, right in your inbox See for yourself \u2014 The Yodel is the go-to source for daily news, entertainment and feel-good stories. Sign up By signing up, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Policy.\n\n\u201cHe is Crooked Joe Biden\u2019s Political Opponent, not mine,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social in March. \u201cI love that he is running!\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s logic wasn\u2019t hard to follow. Kennedy\u2019s father was Democratic icon Robert F. Kennedy, a U.S. attorney general and senator who was shot and killed just as he was closing in on his party\u2019s 1968 presidential nomination. Kennedy\u2019s uncle, John F. Kennedy, was one of the most beloved Democratic presidents of the 20th century. He was assassinated, too.\n\nA lifelong Democrat, RFK Jr. spent much of his career as an environmental lawyer fighting large corporate polluters. (He later pivoted to anti-vaccine activism.) Last year, he chose to challenge Biden in the 2024 Democratic primary before deciding to pursue the presidency as an independent instead.\n\nIn recent weeks, however, something seems to have shifted, and Republicans who initially welcomed Kennedy\u2019s bid (at least one of whom became his top donor) have started to openly disparage him.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cRFK Jr. is a Democrat \u2018Plant,\u2019 a Radical Left Liberal who\u2019s been put in place in order to help Crooked Joe Biden,\u201d Trump wrote last Friday on Truth Social. \u201cA Vote for Junior\u2019 would essentially be a WASTED PROTEST VOTE.\u201d\n\nSo how big a factor could Kennedy be in November? And who should be more afraid of him, Trump or Biden?\n\nWhy there\u2019s debate\n\nThe 2024 election is almost certain to be very close. For months, the Yahoo News/YouGov poll has shown Biden and Trump locked in a statistical tie; a few thousands votes in key swing states could tip the White House one way or the other.\n\nAt the same time, voters have made it abundantly clear that they\u2019re unhappy with having to choose \u2014 again \u2014 between Biden and Trump, who both suffer from historically low approval ratings.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nKennedy is trying to capitalize on Americans\u2019 discontent. So far, polls suggest he is doing a decent job. The numbers vary from survey to survey, but he has consistently averaged about 10% support nationwide, with slightly lower \u2014 but still substantial \u2014 backing in the battleground states.\n\nNo independent or third-party candidate has hit double digits on Election Day since businessman Ross Perot in 1992, so it makes sense for Kennedy\u2019s rivals to be concerned.\n\nAdding to their fear, experts say, is the sense that Kennedy is uniquely positioned to poach from both sides.\n\n\u201cRobert F. Kennedy Jr. has two things going for him. One is a Democratically known last name, which could play to low-informed Democratic voters who are looking for an additional option beyond Biden,\u201d Republican strategist Matthew Bartlett recently told Politico. \u201cBut beyond that, he has a lot of interesting if not conspiratorial ideas, from vaccines to autism to a wide range of fringe ideas that certainly play more to the right than to the left.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nReinforcing the latter point, Yahoo News and YouGov recently tested five false conspiracy theories that Kennedy has promoted \u2014 and without mentioning the candidate\u2019s name, all five generated far more agreement among Trump voters than among Biden voters: that COVID-19 vaccines are more harmful than the virus itself (55% vs. 8%); that climate change is being used as a pretext for imposing totalitarian controls on society (68% vs. 7%); that Prozac and other antidepressants have led to a rise in school shootings (35% vs. 12%); that vaccines cause autism (25% vs. 5%); and that chemicals in the water supply could turn children transgender (8% vs. 4%).\n\nFor now, the Yahoo News/YouGov poll suggests that Kennedy pulls equally from Trump and Biden, who are tied at 44% apiece among registered voters in a head-to-head matchup and 42% apiece against a full field of alternatives (including Kennedy at 5%, up from 2% earlier this year).\n\nBut at least one other recent survey, by NBC News, found Biden coming from 2 points behind to lead Trump by 2 when Kennedy and two other third-party candidates were added as options \u2014 largely because 15% of respondents who initially picked Trump against Biden defected to Kennedy in the five-way matchup (vs. just 7% of those who initially chose Biden).\n\nElsewhere, an April CNN poll showed Kennedy with a much higher favorable rating among Trump voters (42% favorable vs. 16% unfavorable) than among Biden voters (19% favorable vs. 53% unfavorable), while a Politico analysis revealed that Kennedy has raised about twice as much money from 2020 Trump donors than from 2020 Biden donors.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nBoth of these data points suggest that Kennedy\u2019s candidacy might have more upside on the right than on the left. But whether the candidate himself ever manages to transform that potential into votes \u2014 and whether those votes are plentiful enough to affect the outcome in November \u2014 remains to be seen.\n\nWhat\u2019s next\n\nThe main factor that will determine the size and scope of Kennedy\u2019s impact is ballot access, which isn\u2019t guaranteed to independent candidates running outside the party system.\n\nTo date, Kennedy\u2019s campaign has managed to collect the requisite signatures and jump through the requisite hoops in only four states: Utah, Michigan, Hawaii and (as of Wednesday) California.\n\nUtah is a solid red state; Hawaii and California are solidly blue. But Michigan could be tight enough for Kennedy to swing \u2014 and it\u2019s unlikely to have that category all to itself.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAccording to CBS News, \u201cKennedy's campaign says it has completed signature gathering in \u2026 Nevada, Idaho\u2026 New Hampshire, North Carolina, Nebraska and Iowa\u201d \u2014 while a \u201csuper PAC supporting Kennedy, American Values 2024, says it has collected enough signatures in Arizona, Georgia and South Carolina.\u201d\n\nNevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Arizona and Georgia were all decided by narrow margins in 2020.\n\nAnd \u201cI think [Kennedy] has a very good chance of getting onto all 50 ballots,\" Bernard Tamas, an associate professor of political science at Valdosta State University who studies third parties, told CBS. \"It looks like he's on track for it.\"\n\nTo prepare for that possibility \u2014 and for the uncertainty about which side Kennedy will hurt more \u2014 Democrats have been rolling out Biden endorsements from Kennedy family members and aggressively linking RFK Jr. to Trump, while Trump is trying to encourage liberals to vote for Kennedy instead of Biden.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cIf I were a Democrat, I\u2019d vote for RFK Jr. every single time over Biden, because he\u2019s frankly more in line with Democrats,\u201d Trump said last month.\n\nKennedy, meanwhile, seems to be reveling in his newfound relevance. \"Our campaign is a spoiler,\u201d he said in March. \u201cI agree with that. It's a spoiler for President Biden and for President Trump.\u201d\n\nPerspectives\n\nTo be clear: Kennedy has no chance of winning the presidency.\n\n\u201cUnder our system, electoral votes are awarded winner-take-all to the candidate who gets the most votes in each state, with the exception of Maine and Nebraska. That means there is no prize for second place. So unless you can actually win a plurality in the state, your impact on a race is likely to be just pulling votes away from the other candidates. Now, that could change at any point. Kennedy and West are trying. But opinion polls so far do not show them with a clear shot at winning any state.\u201d \u2014 Michael Scherer, Washington Post\n\nAnd polls are probably overstating Kennedy\u2019s support.\n\n\u201cHistorical precedent \u2026 suggests that third-party and independent candidates\u2019 election performances rarely live up to their polling. ... Those who treat being polled as an opportunity to vent their discontent with the system \u2013 are likely to far outnumber those who are fully committed to backing a specific alternative.\" \u2014 Ariel Edwards-Levy, CNN\n\nKennedy just is looking for money and attention \u2014 and MAGA voters are better targets.\n\n\u201cIt appears the more voters learn about Kennedy \u2014 that he's anti-vaccine, a conspiracy theorist, and an all-around weirdo \u2014 the more Democrats are turned off and the more MAGA voters are intrigued. ... If you're looking for gullible people who will give you money to lie to them, you will be far more successful appealing to Trump voters than Biden voters.\u201d \u2014 Amanda Marcotte, Salon\n\nBut Democrats still seem more spooked than Republicans.\n\n\u201cIf Kennedy and [his running mate, tech entrepreneur Nicole] Shanahan represent a bigger threat to Trump, why are Democrats trying to get them to quit the race? The Kennedy-Shanahan ticket is a wild card, and it\u2019s possible their primary appeal is to voters who aren\u2019t particularly interested in supporting either Biden or Trump. But right now, a lot of Democrats are acting like Kennedy and Shanahan will hurt Biden\u2019s campaign more.\u201d \u2014 Jim Geraghty, National Review\n\nAnd Trump \u2014 unlike Biden \u2014 has always relied on third-party candidates to eke out a win.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s campaign isn\u2019t premised on winning a majority, something a Republican has managed only once in the past eight presidential elections, (George W. Bush in 2004). Trump took 46% in 2016 and 47% in 2020. His campaign\u2019s best bet is to sufficiently hold Biden\u2019s vote down in the key swing states to allow 46% or 47% to prevail. That scenario requires third parties to win a significant vote. By contrast, Biden, who won 51% of the vote last time, knows that Trump\u2019s core vote is solid. Rather than try to chip away at Trump\u2019s total, his goal has to be to get past him. Kennedy stands as a threat to that.\u201d \u2014 David Lauter, Los Angeles Times\n\nIn such a close election, the Kennedy effect could go either way \u2014 and that\u2019s the scariest part.\n\n\u201c[Recent polls suggest that] Kennedy\u2019s presence on the ballot in swing states would pull voters from both major-party candidates. The effect of doing so, however, is uncertain, and it\u2019s not clear that Kennedy would shift the winner in any state from Trump to Biden or vice versa. But, also? He might. For the major-party campaigns, the takeaway is simpler: Kennedy\u2019s candidacy constitutes the worst kind of wrench in the system \u2014 one with an unclear outcome.\u201d \u2014 Philip Bump, Washington Post\n\nNone of this would be a problem if America used ranked-choice voting.\n\n\u201cBy awarding voters the power to rank the field in order, [ranked-choice voting] fixes the spoiler effect that emerges in any race with more than two candidates. \u2026 If someone wins a majority of first-place support during the first round, they win, as in any other election. If not, the last-place finishers are eliminated, one by one, and their supporters' second choices come into play to identify a majority winner. In other words, voters this fall could choose to rank RFK Jr. first (or another third-party candidate), and if that candidate fares poorly, the voter\u2019s ballot would be counted for a backup choice instead.\u201d \u2014 David Daley, Salon",

        "text": "Crime Rates and the 2024 Election: What You Need to Know\nAs crime data again becomes a flashpoint in the presidential campaign, experts push for better national statistics.\n\nAs the 2024 presidential election approaches, crime and safety continue to rank high on voters\u2019 minds. But the two presumptive nominees have offered dramatically different accounts of crime trends, and come to opposite conclusions about whether people are more or less safe than they were four years ago.\n\nThe dispute started after President Joe Biden released a statement touting a new quarterly report from the FBI showing dramatic crime rate reductions between 2023 and 2024. Experts say the decline is real, but that the interpretation of the numbers is likely exaggerated.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump was quick to criticize the data\u2019s limitations, claiming crime is \u201cso much up.\u201d He cited a different data source that is only current through 2022, based on a survey of Americans to determine if they were victims of crime. And like Biden, Trump missed part of the story by zooming in to cherry-pick a statistic in his favor. Zooming out to see the big picture, the overall trend in crime victimization suggests that by 2022, crime had returned to pre-pandemic norms.\n\nThis messy dispute on crime data points to a more serious problem: The national crime statistics leave yawning gaps, and collecting better crime data should be a nonpartisan issue, said John Roman, director of the Center on Public Safety & Justice, NORC at the University of Chicago.\n\n\u201cThe data itself shouldn\u2019t be controversial,\u201d Roman said. \u201cThe more we can improve the crime data, the less controversial it is, and the more we can have policy debates that are based on different approaches to solving the problem, rather than debates about what the facts are.\u201d\n\nRoman also chairs the Council on Criminal Justice\u2019s working group on better crime data. In June, the group put out a report urging an increase to the Bureau of Justice Statistics\u2019 budget to $93 million so it can, among other things, produce monthly estimates of national crime statistics.\n\nBut in lieu of better national crime statistics, as Biden and Trump continue spar over crime trends, here\u2019s what to know.\n\nBiden says crime is way down. Where does that data come from?\n\nThe recent White House statement about falling crime in 2024 cited the FBI\u2019s quarterly crime data, which included numbers from 11,000 police agencies around the country and trumpeted a 26% decrease in homicides. \u201cAmericans are safer today than when I took office,\u201d Biden said in the statement.\n\nNearly 8,000 police agencies weren\u2019t included in the quarterly crime statistics report, which is a relatively new offering, first issued in 2020. It was partly introduced because of the lag that has long plagued national crime reporting. Historically, the agency has only released data annually, about 10 months after the end of the year. While the quarterly reports are more timely, they are also preliminary because crime data often changes with police investigations, and fewer agencies submit information to the quarterly report than to the annual one. As a result, they sometimes contains errors, according to criminologists.\n\nFor example, the FBI\u2019s quarterly data recorded 46 homicides from the New York Police Department, but the department\u2019s own data showed 82 murders from the first quarter of this year. In Dallas, where the FBI\u2019s data documented 33 murders, Texas\u2019 crime data dashboard showed 50 such incidents.\n\nA spokesperson from the NYPD said that the department is adjusting and adopting its data reporting system to the federal government\u2019s new standards, and as a result, some of the data initially reported to the FBI might be rejected and not counted because \u201cit may not entirely conform with these new data reporting standards.\u201d Overall, 98% of the data that NYPD reported to the FBI was accepted, the spokesperson said.\n\nBut of the largest cities where The Marshall Project compared FBI\u2019s statistics with the local statistics, most of the numbers are spot on or show small differences.\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for crime data to change, said Darrel Stephens, a former executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association. Sometimes the crime classification can change, and sometimes crime reported to the FBI can initially be incomplete.\n\n\u201cI don't worry much about mismatches like that,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cIf the information gives you a sense that there is an increasing or decreasing problem, or it can give you some insight into the nature of the problem, then whether it's exactly precise doesn't matter to me.\u201d\n\nTrump said crime rates are actually up. Is he right?\n\nAs Biden and the Democratic Party attempt to use falling crime rates to boost voters\u2019 confidence in the administration, Republicans are pointing to flaws in the data and accusing Biden of cooking the books.\n\n\u201c[Biden] says crime is down,\u201d Trump said in a rally in Philadelphia last week. \u201cCrime is so much up.\u201d Then, after a long digression about asylum seekers, political correctness, fake news and Biden\u2019s age, Trump returned to the subject. \u201cAccording to the much better crime victimization survey, there has actually been a 43% increase in violent crime since I left office,\u201d Trump said in the speech that aired live on Newsmax.\n\nTrump is right that the National Crime Victimization Survey is considered a more robust data source than the preliminary quarterly numbers from the FBI. However, the most recent NCVS is nearly 18 months out of date and says nothing about what crime rates look like right now. Trump also left out that the same year\u2019s FBI crime data \u2014 the other national gold standard \u2014 showed a slight decrease in 2022.\n\nThat discrepancy between the the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting program and NCVS numbers was a mystifying phenomenon in the 2022 crime statistics, made possible because the two reports measure different things. The FBI crime data represents incidents reported to the police and is useful for understanding law enforcement\u2019s view, while the victimization survey relies on interviews with over 150,000 families and is useful (albeit broadly) for understanding how people experience crime.\n\nCriminologists have some hypotheses about why the Justice Department\u2019s two pillars of crime statistics show such different year-over-year trends. For one, the victimization survey is historically much more volatile from one year to the next, as seen in the chart above \u2014 so it may be influenced by statistical noise. Second, crimes reported to the police are subject to factors like police staffing levels, police response time and overall levels of community trust.\n\nMost importantly, the victimization survey captures a slightly different time frame. Using the 2022 reports as an example, while the FBI\u2019s crime data collects information from the calendar year, the victimization survey covers victims\u2019 experiences from July 1, 2021 to Nov. 30, 2022. Since the NCVS shows an increase in violent crime, it\u2019s potentially because violent crime rates were higher in the latter part of 2021.\n\nDespite the one-year differences, the longer trends in FBI\u2019s crime data and the victimization survey both show that violent crime is returning to pre-pandemic levels: After the initial increase in violent crimes and decrease in property crimes at the beginning of the pandemic, now violent crime is going down. And property crimes are seeing an uptick, but not surpassing where they were before the pandemic.\n\nOK so the best crime statistics are slow, and the faster ones are incomplete. Can we say anything with confidence about how things look today?\n\nAll the best available evidence we have today suggests that crime is indeed going down. But until the 2023 FBI crime statistics and the Bureau of Justice Statistics\u2019s victimization survey are published in the fall, our national picture remains murky.\n\nLocally, data from individual police departments can convey a more accurate \u2014 though patchy \u2014 picture about crime. Many dashboards, studies and media coverage relied on data compiled directly from police agencies. Most of them showed an overarching decrease in murders and shootings, though there are always outliers, and it\u2019s hard to draw nationwide conclusions when data from suburban and rural police agencies are far less accessible than in big cities.\n\nHere are a few examples of how non-government organizations are tracking crime statistics:\n\nIn all of these data collection efforts, the violent crime trend is the same, with fewer murders and shootings each year since 2022.\n\nBut the limitations of these data are just as clear: The majority of efforts for more timely crime data rely on data from major cities and police departments. They do not capture trends in the suburbs or rural areas.\n\n\u201cOnly the federal government has the resources to capture everybody, rural areas, urban areas, non-metropolitan counties,\u201d said John Roman. \u201cThis is the reason why we put so much emphasis on improving federal government reporting.\u201d\n\nIs the FBI \u201ccooking\u201d crime statistics?\n\nWhen the FBI\u2019s crime statistics started to show a decrease in violent crime in 2023 and 2024, Trump and his supporters cast doubt on the finding, going as far as claiming that the FBI is manufacturing the crime statistics in favor of Biden.\n\nSeveral criminologists told us this claim is completely unfounded.\n\nOn the contrary, because so many police agencies already publish weekly \u2014 if not daily \u2014 crime data, and because so many non-government organizations are tracking crime statistics on their own, these sources provide another layer of verification for the FBI\u2019s crime data.\n\nAnd right now, every source points to a decrease in violent crime. \u201cThis means the FBI\u2019s Q1 2024 data is incomplete, not inaccurate,\u201d said Alex Piquero, a criminology professor at the University of Miami and Senior Adviser to the CCJ Crime Trends Working Group.\n\nBecome a Member Join the community that keeps criminal justice on the front page.\n\nThe preliminary quarterly estimates are usually good enough to see the big-picture trends, such as drops in violent crimes. But the scale of the trend is far fuzzier than the statistics cited by the White House.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no fudging of the numbers, and the drop is real,\u201d Piquero said. \u201cThe question, of course, is how big that drop will be, and then how big that drop will be across crime types. That's the thing that we just don't fully grasp yet.\u201d\n\nWhy is the federal government so slow at tracking crime data? Has anyone tried to make it faster?\n\nThe national crime collection program has historically lacked resources. And for a long time, the general assumption has been that local law enforcement agencies should be responsible for collecting crime data, and the federal agencies should just sum up the numbers at the end of the year. Increasingly, Roman said, that's become \u201can antiquated view of the world,\u201d because policymakers need more real-time data.\n\n\u201cWhen COVID happened, you saw how good the data were \u2014 the tracking of cases, the testing and the deaths,\u201d said Piquero. \u201cViolence is a public health issue, and we have to treat the data just as we treat public health data.\u201d That position \u2014 one that\u2019s gained in popularity in recent years \u2014 got a new high-profile ally this week when U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy declared firearm violence a public health crisis.\n\nTrump and Biden both inherited the data lag problem, but neither did much to improve the national crime statistics, and it only worsened during their presidencies.\n\nWhen Trump took office in 2016, the FBI was already in the process of modernizing its crime data collection system, announcing that it would retire a century-old data collection by 2021. By Jan. 1, 2021, the FBI decided to go through with its plan, and thousands of police agencies could not report data to the FBI because of that.\n\n\"The current administration walked into COVID. And [COVID] affected the first two years of the Biden presidency,\" said Piquero, who served as the director of the Bureau of Justice Statistics from 2022 to 2023. \"Is crime data reporting the highest priority of administration then? Probably not. Should it be? In my mind, crime data should be just as important as any other data collection.\"\n\nIn 2022, the FBI rolled back its decision and told police agencies that they could submit data through the previously retired system, a decision that continued into the following years. But in many places, the transition continues to cause confusion and errors in crime statistics.\n\nThe FBI is expected to release the 2023 national crime stats this fall, how good will they be?\n\nBy the end of 2023, over 15,000 police agencies reported their crime statistics to the FBI. Of those agencies, 13,770 submitted data through the National Incident-Based Reporting System, while almost 1,500 submitted data through the Summary Reporting System \u2014 an older, more limited system that had previously been retired by the FBI.\n\nTogether, these agencies covered nearly 85% of the U.S. population. That\u2019s a significant improvement from 2021, when the FBI temporarily retired the older data collection system and received data from only 60% of police agencies in the country.\n\nMost notably, in 2023 the New York Police Department started submitting data through NIBRS \u2014 the new, more granular system \u2014 meaning the largest police department in the country is now reporting data to the federal government.\n\nWhile the majority of states saw nearly every police agency submitting data to the FBI, a handful of states like Florida, Mississippi, California and New York State still fell behind.\n\nThis piece was updated to include a longer segment of an interview with Alex Piquero that clarifies the time period referenced. It also adds Piquero's role in the CCJ Crime Trends Working Group.\n\nLearn about how The Marshall Project is covering the 2024 election\u2019s criminal justice and immigration issues across the U.S. and in our local news teams\u2019 cities.",

        "text": "Biden falls flat against Trump in first 2024 US presidential debate\nThe current president was perceived as stumbling over his words while the Republican Trump repeated numerous falsehoods.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and Donald Trump have squared off in the first debate of the 2024 United States presidential race, seeking to pull ahead in a match-up that has, so far, been in a dead heat.\n\nBut despite delivering the opening salvo in Thursday\u2019s event, Biden struggled to articulate his points at several moments, appearing to fumble for his words.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump took the opportunity to redirect the conversation at several points to Biden\u2019s perceived weaknesses, drumming up fears about immigration and the state of the economy.\n\nHe also attempted to dodge questions about whether he would honour the results of November 5\u2019s presidential election, saying he would only do so if it was \u201cfair\u201d and \u201cfree\u201d \u2013 and then reiterating false claims that the 2020 election was rigged.\n\n\u201cThe fraud and everything else was ridiculous,\u201d he said at one point, casting doubt on President Biden\u2019s win in 2020.\n\nTrump currently faces two criminal indictments \u2013 one in Georgia and another in Washington, DC \u2013 over his alleged attempts to subvert those election results.\n\nRusty on stage?\n\nThursday evening\u2019s performance took place at the CNN news network\u2019s studios in Atlanta, Georgia, and it marked the first time since October 2020 that the two candidates met on the debate stage.\n\nMany political observers wondered if they would be rusty, neither having participated in a public debate of any kind in the years since.\n\nBiden had spent the week leading up to the debate at Camp David in Maryland, a presidential retreat where aides helped him prepare with mock set-ups. Trump, meanwhile, largely continued his schedule of rallies.\n\nBut from the moment Biden stepped on stage, the Democratic president seemed to wobble, muttering as he approached the podium.\n\nStill, as he faced the first question of the night, Biden came out swinging, seeking to dent Trump\u2019s popularity by attacking the Republican\u2019s leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe had an economy that was in free fall,\u201d Biden told the room, which was largely empty except for two CNN moderators, Dana Bash and Jake Tapper. \u201cBy the time he left, things were in chaos. Things were in chaos. So we put things back together.\u201d\n\nHe also mocked Trump\u2019s resistance to COVID-19 safeguards, saying his philosophy echoed the misinformation circulating online about cures: \u201cJust inject a little bleach into your arm, and you\u2019ll be alright.\u201d\n\nBut when Trump was given a chance to respond, his opening remarks reflected a characteristic hyperbole the Republican candidate has become known for.\n\n\u201cWe had the greatest economy in the history of our country. We have never done so well. Everybody was amazed by it. Other countries were copying us,\u201d Trump said in his opening remarks, quipping later: \u201cEverything was rocking good.\u201d\n\nA critical night in a tight race\n\nThe night was a crucial event for both Trump and Biden, as they sought to advance different visions of the US. Trump implied that the country declined under Biden\u2019s leadership. Biden, meanwhile, sought to defend the US\u2019s standing in the world.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never heard a president talk like this before. We\u2019re the envy of the world. Name me a single major country that wouldn\u2019t trade places with the United States of America,\u201d said Biden at one point.\n\n\u201cNo one thinks we\u2019re weak. No one wants to screw around with us. Nobody.\u201d\n\nTrump, however, fired back at one point: \u201cJoe, our country is being destroyed as you and I sit up here and waste a lot of time on this debate.\u201d\n\nIn the lead-up to Thursday\u2019s debate, polls showed Trump and Biden in a tight race, though the Republican appeared to be edging ahead.\n\nA survey from The New York Times and Siena College, released on the eve of the event, showed Trump with nearly 48 percent support, close to four points ahead of Biden, who was around 44 percent.\n\nPolitical observers noted that Thursday\u2019s performance could deepen that divide.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been speaking to Republicans and Democrats since the debate ended,\u201d said Al Jazeera correspondent Alan Fisher. \u201cAnd the overwhelming view is that this was a very good night for Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nMuch of it had to do with stage presence, Fisher continued. He noted that Trump reiterated many talking points from his campaign rallies.\n\n\u201cYep, Joe Biden called out Donald Trump on his lies, on his falsehoods, on his exaggerations, on things that simply are not true. But Donald Trump looked as if he was in command,\u201d Fisher explained. \u201cBiden didn\u2019t finish thoughts. He looked confused on certain points. And this was a bad night for him.\u201d\n\nFisher added that the debate will underscore questions about Biden\u2019s age: The Democratic president is 81, while his Republican rival is 78. \u201cThis performance is not going to do anything to assuage those concerns.\u201d\n\nUnusual event with familiar talking points\n\nThe debate was unusual for several reasons, not least because of its historically early timing: Both Biden and Trump pushed to move the first presidential debate of the election cycle to June, to avoid overlaps with early voting, which begins in some states in September.\n\nBut that put the inaugural debate of 2024 ahead of even the major party conventions, where the candidates are officially named the Democratic and Republican nominees.\n\nIn another departure from tradition, Biden and Trump bypassed the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates to organise the debates themselves, negotiating directly with CNN to host it.\n\nThursday\u2019s debate, however, was only the first of two presidential debates scheduled for this year, and political observers are hoping that Biden can distance himself from his inaugural debate performance by the time he reaches the second on September 10.\n\nTrump repeatedly slammed Biden on immigration, using heated anti-immigrant rhetoric to conjure fears of violence.\n\n\u201cHe wants open borders. He wants our country to either be destroyed or he wants to pick up those people as voters,\u201d Trump said of Biden.\n\nBiden tried to dispel the link between immigration and crime: Studies have shown immigrants, on average, are less likely to commit crimes than US-born citizens.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of young women who have been raped by their in-laws, by their spouses,\u201d Biden responded at one point after Trump made claims that \u201cthere have been many young women murdered by the people he allows to cross the border\u201d.\n\nBiden also tried to call out Trump\u2019s falsehoods when it came to abortion access. Trump made the erroneous claim that Biden and other Democrats were \u201cwilling to, as we say, rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re lying. That is simply not true,\u201d Biden retorted. \u201cWe are not for late-term abortion, period. Period.\u201d\n\nAd hominem attacks\n\nBut the debate devolved at several points into each candidate exchanging accusations that the other was lying or whining.\n\nAt one point, they even started to compare their golf games, with Biden challenging Trump to carry his own bag of equipment and Trump mocking Biden\u2019s swing.\n\nBiden slammed Trump for media reports that the Republican president called veterans \u201csuckers and losers\u201d, invoking the loss of his own son, Beau Biden.\n\n\u201cMy son was not a loser or a sucker. You are a loser. You are a sucker,\u201d Biden told Trump.\n\nBut even there, Trump responded forcefully, saying the media report was a fabrication: \u201cHe made up the suckers and losers, so he should apologise to me right now.\u201d\n\nWhen Biden tried to press Trump about his lukewarm reaction to the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia \u2014 which saw white supremacists march through the streets with tiki torches \u2014 Trump likewise attempted to deflect.\n\n\u201cFor three and a half years, we\u2019ve been living in hell,\u201d Trump responded. \u201cThis is a hundred times Charlottesville, a thousand times Charlottesville.\u201d\n\nDemocrats rally around the president\n\nBut despite criticisms of Biden\u2019s debate-night performance, Democrats rallied around the president in the hours after the event, repeating accusations that Trump represents an existential threat to US democracy.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t turn your back because of one performance. What kind of party does that?\u201d said California Governor Gavin Newsom when asked if Biden should step down. \u201cThis president has delivered. We need to deliver for him at this moment.\u201d\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, Biden\u2019s running mate, acknowledged weaknesses but said the president turned out a good performance in the end.\n\n\u201cYes there was a slow start, but it was a strong finish,\u201d she said in an interview on CNN.\n\nHowever, Fisher, the Al Jazeera correspondent, reported there were rumblings about finding a replacement candidate, should Biden no longer be perceived as having a viable path to victory.\n\n\u201cIf Joe Biden has one thing in his favour, it\u2019s that there\u2019s five months until the election. So they have time to fix this. But how they do that, that\u2019s the concern,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThis has upended the entire race.\u201d",

        "text": "Six takeaways from the Biden-Trump presidential debate\nWho won the debate? From Trump\u2019s overstatements to Biden\u2019s faltering speech, here are the highlights.\n\nBiden believes that the country should invest in manufacturing and expanding job opportunities\n\nAmerican voters watched the two main presidential contenders for the November 5 election brawl it out on Thursday night in the first public debate before the contest.\n\nFormer US President Donald Trump, 78, hurled hyperbole at President Joe Biden, 81, who seemed to lose his train of thought during the debate at the CNN headquarters in Atlanta.\n\nThe two oldest presidential hopefuls in US history clashed over immigration, abortion and even golf.\n\nHere are six key takeaways from the first US presidential debate:\n\nBiden put on a muted performance\n\nBiden, who already faces criticism over his age was unable to match the energy of Trump, who is only three years his junior.\n\nThe incumbent president resorted to raspy rambling and appeared to struggle with articulating his words. At one point, he referred to \u201cbillionaires\u201d as \u201ctrillionaires\u201d before going back to correct himself.\n\nBiden made some robust criticism of Trump\u2019s leadership during COVID-19 and its impact on the economy, and mocked some of Trump\u2019s responses to COVID-19 safeguards at the time. \u201cJust inject a little bleach into your arm, and you\u2019ll be alright,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, his tone fell flat against his more bombastic opponent, especially during the early stages of the debate. Later on, Biden somewhat picked up the pace to push back against Trump\u2019s slew of factually incorrect assertions about immigration and abortion.\n\nHowever, Democrats raised the alarm over Biden\u2019s performance, with some even starting to talk about replacing him on the presidential ticket.\n\n\u201cThere are going to be discussions about whether he [Biden] should continue,\u201d David Axelrod, former senior adviser to former President Barack Obama, told CNN.\n\nWhile Biden\u2019s Vice President Kamala Harris backed him after the debate, saying substance matters over style in this election, even she conceded \u201cit was a slow start\u201d.\n\nPresidential hopefuls came to blows over golf\n\nBiden and Trump went back and forth over which of them is physically and cognitively stronger.\n\nTrump boasted about his strength, claiming, \u201cI\u2019m in as good shape as I was 25, 30 years ago,\u201d to moderators Jake Tapper and Dana Bash.\n\nIn response, a snickering Biden implied his opponent was lying about both his height and weight.\n\nTrump said he had won two championships on his golf course while Biden \u201ccan\u2019t hit the ball 50 yards\u201d.\n\nThis prompted Biden to challenge Trump to a golf match, only if Trump would carry his own bag.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not act like children,\u201d said Trump.\n\n\u201cYou are a child,\u201d responded Biden.\n\nTrump called Biden a \u2018bad Palestinian\u2019\n\n\u201cWe are the biggest producer of support for Israel of anyone in the world,\u201d Biden said, reiterating US support for Israel\u2019s war on Gaza in which more than 37,718 Palestinians have been killed since October last year.\n\nBiden added that his administration is continuing to send experts and intelligence to hinder Palestinian group Hamas in the war.\n\nTrump snapped back, saying it is Israel that wants to continue with the war, \u201cand you should let them go, and let them finish the job. He [Biden] doesn\u2019t want to do it. He\u2019s become like a Palestinian, but they don\u2019t like him because he\u2019s a very bad Palestinian, he\u2019s a weak one\u201d.\n\nIn the nearly nine months of the war that has left Gaza rife with power outages and food insecurity, the United States has provided military and diplomatic assistance to Israel, and has repeatedly blocked ceasefire resolutions. A US-sponsored resolution endorsing a ceasefire proposal eventually only passed at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) some eight months into the war.\n\nBiden accused Trump of lying about abortion\n\nTrump invoked anti-abortion sentiment by accusing Biden and his party of allowing late-term abortions.\n\nDuring the debate, Trump claimed Biden and Democrats would be \u201cwilling to, as we say, rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re lying. That is simply not true,\u201d Biden refuted Trump\u2019s assertion. \u201cWe are not for late-term abortion, period. Period.\u201d\n\nTrump also said of Democrats: \u201cThey will take the life of a child \u2026 even after birth\u201d, despite the fact that infanticide is illegal in every US state.\n\nIn the US, late-term abortions are uncommon and are usually a last resort when there are serious complications with a wanted pregnancy.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, fewer than 1 percent of abortions were performed at or after 21 weeks in 2020.\n\nImmigration dogged the debate\n\nThroughout the debate, Trump turned the topic to immigration, accusing Biden of \u201copening up the safest border in the world to terrorists, prisoners\u201d.\n\nHe accused Biden of being \u201cthe one that killed people with a bad border and flooding hundreds of thousands of people dying and also killing our citizens when they come in\u201d.\n\nBiden on the other hand recounted the work his administration has done to manage an influx of illegal immigrants, including tightening border security and working on the bipartisan National Security Agreement.\n\n\u201cBy the way, the border patrol have endorsed me, endorsed my position,\u201d a wide-eyed Biden said. \u201cWhen he [Trump] was president, he was separating babies from their mothers, putting them in cages, making sure their families were separated. That\u2019s not the right way to go\u201d.\n\nTrump snapped back, saying, \u201cthe border patrol, I won\u2019t say that, but they endorsed me for president\u201d.\n\nTrump refused to say if he would honour election result\n\nTrump did not directly answer whether he would honour the result of the election.\n\nHe said he would only accept the results if the election is \u201cfree and fair\u201d, reiterating false claims that the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Biden, was rigged against him.\n\n\u201cThe fraud and everything else was ridiculous,\u201d he said.\n\nFollowing the 2020 election result, Trump incited his supporters to storm the US Capitol in the infamous January 6, 2021 Capitol riots.\n\nDuring the debate, Trump downplayed the riots, which were the deadliest attack on US power in more than 200 years. \u201cThey talk about a relatively small number of people that went to the Capitol and in many cases were ushered in by the police,\u201d he said.\n\nThe next presidential debate is slated for September 10 and will be hosted by ABC news.",

        "text": "US election 2024: Debate 'a disaster for Joe Biden' \u2013 DW \u2013 06\nBiden and Donald Trump squared off in the first of two debates before the November election. Key moments included verbal stumbles by Biden and Trump's cageyness on whether he'd accept the election results.\n\nIt was the first debate between a current and a former US president, and it was a doozy. Democratic President Joe Biden and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump met in Atlanta Thursday night local time, more than four months ahead of the 2024 US presidential election, and discussed immigration, the economy and a host of other issues.\n\nOne of the biggest takeaways: The Democrats are in trouble. From the very start, Biden's voice sounded brittle, which several campaign sources after the debate attributed to a cold. This would normally not be a huge deal, normally, it made 81-year-old Biden, whose age has been a major point of contention throughout the campaign, seem extra frail.\n\n\"I would've leaked the fact that he had a cough,\" J. Miles Coleman, election analyst with the University of Virginia Center for Politics, told DW. \"Had [Biden's team] got that out ahead of time, it may have been baked into some people's expectations, and they would have judged him a little kinder or lighter.\"\n\nBiden had a shaky performance in the first debate Image: Michael Reynolds/EPA\n\nBiden couldn't prove he's 'fit for office'\n\nBiden's reviews after the debate weren't kind, and not just because of his hoarseness. The audience didn't need Trump to point out, as he occasionally did, that a number of Biden's rambling sentences didn't make sense.\n\nFor voters who are firmly in the Democratic or the \"never Trump\" camp, a TV debate like this isn't likely to make a big difference. But for those who haven't yet made up their minds, debates are a chance to hear from both candidates on crucial issues \u2015 and see how they carry themselves. Ahead of the event on Thursday, two major questions were whether Biden would be agile enough to wipe out any concerns about his age, and whether Trump would be able to behave presidentially.\n\nUS voters concerned over Biden's age ahead of elections To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nBiden definitely didn't meet this goal, experts say.\n\n\"There is nothing to sugarcoat here: This debate was a disaster for Joe Biden,\" said Ines Pohl, bureau chief of DW's Washington D.C. studio. \"The main objective for Biden tonight was to demonstrate that he is fit for office, but he failed miserably.\"\n\nDavid Axelrod, a senior advisor to President Barack Obama until 2011, said on CNN that Biden failed to give an energetic impression and even seemed a little disoriented at times. Coleman also said that while Trump, who is 78, is only a few years younger than Biden, he seemed a decade younger than the current president.\n\nTrump refuses to answer questions\n\nThe former president fared better in achieving his goal, appearing presidential. Unlike during his first debate against Biden in 2020, he did not constantly interrupt his opponent \u2015 it probably helped that when it wasn't a candidate's turn to talk, his microphone was switched off. But the most unpresidential behavior of the night also came from Biden, not Trump, who poked fun of the Republican candidate's weight.\n\nTrump had a more successful debate than his opponent, analysts say Image: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nTrump did ignore the moderators' prompts a number of times. Instead of replying to questions about childcare or his age, Trump returned to his favorite subject again and again: How irregular immigrants who managed to come into the US because of Biden's policy would destroy the country.\n\n\"He sees sticking to the topic of a question as basically optional,\" election analyst Coleman said. \"Overall, he did not get much pushback from the moderators.\"\n\nTrump also blatantly lied more than once during the debate. To name one example regarding his favorite subject, he claimed that under his presidency, the US border was the safest \"in the history of our country.\" But irregular migration into the US was higher during Trump's term than during either of Barack Obama's terms, according to fact checkers at the Poynter Institute.\n\nTrump cagey about accepting election results\n\nIn one of the debate's key moments, Trump also refused to say whether he would accept the results of the upcoming election, no matter who won.\n\nThe question was a reminder of what happened after the last election. In 2020, Trump refused to accept his loss to Biden and claimed the Democrats had manipulated results. He stuck to his narrative of the stolen election even after recounts and court decisions had disproven it. That attitude played a part in encouraging right-wing Trump supporters to storm the Capitol on January 6, 2021 in an attempt to disrupt the democratic transfer of power.\n\nAfter deflecting twice during the debate, Trump finally said he would accept the 2024 election results if it was a \"fair and legal and good election,\" without specifying what that meant.\n\nJury finds Trump guilty of all charges in hush-money trial To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nDemocrats 'in a state of panic'\n\nBiden's generally confused performance meant he failed to make strong points even on topics that should've been a homerun for the Democrat, like attacking Trump over his criminal convictions or presenting himself as a champion of reproductive rights. His promise to reinstate the nation-wide constitutional right to abortion, which the Supreme Court rescinded in 2022 with the votes of three conservative Trump-appointed justices, didn't really land because of his lackluster delivery.\n\nImmediately after the debate ended, there was talk of whether the Democrats could still somehow nominate a different candidate to run for president before or at the Democratic National Convention in August. CNN reporters said they had heard \"concern\" about Biden as the candidate from Democratic politicians, without naming names.\n\nInes Pohl, who also covered the 2016 and 2020 elections for DW, said that Biden's sub-par performance at the debate \"sparked discussions on how the Democratic Party can prevent Biden from running again.\" One way to do this would be opening up the convention for delegates to elect a different candidate. That would be highly unusual, looking at the past few decades of US politics.\n\nBut these aren't usual times, says Pohl: \"The Democrats are in a state of panic.\"\n\nEdited by: Kate Hairsine",

        "text": "Biden\u2019s poor performance and Trump\u2019s lies: four key takeaways from the debate\n1. Biden performs poorly The president joked about the rightwing conspiracies that he would take some kind of performance-enhancing drugs before the debate, posting a link to a can of water for sale on his campaign website called \u201cDark Brandon\u2019s Secret Sauce\u201d. But his low-energy, muted and garbled performance didn\u2019t live up to expectations. And keep in mind: Biden challenged the former president to the debate, which looks like a strategic error in retrospect. Voters regularly say they are concerned about Biden\u2019s age and fitness for office. This debate will not assuage their fears. If someone were reading a transcript of Biden\u2019s remarks, some of his lines would sound smart and aggressive. But the delivery failed \u2013 and for a visual medium like TV, that\u2019s critical. He failed to sell his signature accomplishments, like his infrastructure plan. From the start, Biden\u2019s voice was muffled. He trailed off. In one gaffe, attacking Trump on his tax cuts and the national debt, he confusingly ended his remarks with: \u201cWe finally beat Medicare.\u201d Trump jumped on the moment: \u201cHe did beat Medicare. He beat it to death, and he\u2019s destroying Medicare.\u201d On an abortion question, which should be one of Biden\u2019s strongest assets for voters concerned about rolling back reproductive rights, Biden brought up girls killed by migrants \u2013 pivoting, for some reason, to one of his weakest areas. He became more lively over the course of the evening, but not enough to change the narrative of how the debate went down optically. The evening will undoubtedly lead Democrats to debate whether Biden should somehow be replaced at the convention.\n\n2. Trump lies endlessly As expected for a politician so consistently factchecked, Trump repeatedly tried to sell falsehoods and half-truths to voters. When questions were posed that would require tough answers, like one about the January 6 insurrection, he deflected and talked about something he could attack Biden on. CNN\u2019s moderators did not factcheck statements live. At times, when he avoided the question, they would reiterate it \u2013 sometimes successfully getting Trump to answer. He falsely claimed Democrats want abortions up until and \u201ceven after birth\u201d. He said without evidence that Nancy Pelosi refused his offer for national guard troops on 6 January 2021 to respond to an insurrection he encouraged. He said his administration had the \u201cbest environmental numbers\u201d, whatever that means. And his promise that retribution would mark a second term in office surfaced too, in what seemed to be a veiled threat of prosecution: \u201cHe could be a convicted felon as soon as he gets out of office. Joe could be a convicted felon with all of the things that he\u2019s done. He\u2019s done horrible things.\u201d\n\n3. Different visions were starkly on display The two men showed the distinctions of the two Americas in which they live. Trump repeatedly talked about how the US had failed, how Biden was the worst president in the country\u2019s history and how the world views the country dismally now. \u201cJoe, our country is being destroyed. As you and I sit up here and waste a lot of time on this debate. This shouldn\u2019t be a debate. He is the worst president, he just said about me because I said it. But look, he\u2019s the worst president in the history of our country. He\u2019s destroyed our country.\u201d Biden disagreed, offering an optimistic view of the US on the world stage. \u201cWe\u2019re the most admired country in the world. We\u2019re the United States of America. There\u2019s nothing beyond our capacity. We have the finest military in the history of the world, the finest in the history of the world. No one thinks we\u2019re weak. No one wants to screw around with us, nobody.\u201d",

        "text": "READ: Biden-Trump debate transcript\nCNN \u2014\n\nPresident Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump participated in their first debate of the 2024 election season on CNN in Atlanta Thursday.\n\nRead the final, corrected transcript of the debate below:\n\nJAKE TAPPER, CNN MODERATOR: We\u2019re live from Georgia, a key battleground state in the race for the White House. In just moments, the current U.S. president will debate the former U.S. president as their parties\u2019 presumptive nominees, a first in American history.\n\nWe want to welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world to our studios in Atlanta.\n\nThis is the CNN presidential debate.\n\nDANA BASH, CNN MODERATOR: This debate is being produced by CNN and it\u2019s coming to you live on CNN, CNN International, CNN.com, CNN Max, and CNN Espanol.\n\nThis is a pivotal moment between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump in their rematch for the nation\u2019s highest office. Each will make his case to the American people with just over four months until Election Day.\n\nGood evening. I\u2019m Dana Bash, anchor of CNN\u2019s \u201cInside Politics\u201d and co-anchor of \u201cState Of The Union.\u201d\n\nTAPPER: I\u2019m Jake Tapper, anchor of CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Lead\u201d and co-anchor of \u201cState Of The Union.\u201d\n\nDana and I will co-moderate this evening. Our job is to facilitate a debate between the two candidates tonight.\n\nBefore we introduce them, we want to share the rules of the debate with the audience at home.\n\nFormer President Trump will be on the left side of the screen. President Biden will be appearing on the right. A coin toss determined their positions.\n\nEach candidate will have two minutes to answer a question, and one minute each for responses and rebuttals. An additional minute for follow-up, clarification or response is at the moderators\u2019 discretion.\n\nBASH: When it\u2019s time for a candidate to speak, his microphone will be turned on and his opponent\u2019s microphone will be turned off. Should a candidate interrupt when his microphone is muted, he will be difficult to understand for viewers at home.\n\nAt the end of the debate, each candidate will get two minutes for closing statements.\n\nThere is no studio audience tonight. Pre-written notes, props or contact with campaign staff are not permitted during the debate.\n\nBy accepting our invitation to debate, both candidates and their campaigns agreed to accept these rules.\n\nTAPPER: Now please welcome the 46th president of the United States, Joe Biden.\n\nJOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: How are you? Good to be here. Thank you.\n\nTAPPER: And please welcome the 45th president of the United States, Donald Trump.\n\nGentlemen, thanks so much for being here. Let\u2019s begin the debate. And let\u2019s start with the issue that voters consistently say is their top concern, the economy.\n\nPresident Biden, inflation has slowed, but prices remain high. Since you took office, the price of essentials has increased. For example, a basket of groceries that cost $100 then, now costs more than $12; and typical home prices have jumped more than 30 percent.\n\nWhat do you say to voters who feel they are worse off under your presidency than they were under President Trump?\n\nBIDEN: You have to take a look at what I was left when I became president, what Mr. Trump left me.\n\nWe had an economy that was in freefall. The pandemic are so badly handled, many people were dying. All he said was, it\u2019s not that serious. Just inject a little bleach in your arm. It\u2019d be all right.\n\nThe economy collapsed. There were no jobs. Unemployment rate rose to 15 percent. It was terrible.\n\nAnd so, what we had to do is try to put things back together again. That\u2019s exactly what we began to do. We created 15,000 new jobs. We brought on \u2013 in a position where we have 800,000 new manufacturing jobs.\n\nBut there\u2019s more to be done. There\u2019s more to be done. Working class people are still in trouble.\n\nI come from Scranton, Pennsylvania. I come from a household where the kitchen table \u2013 if things weren\u2019t able to be met during the month was a problem. Price of eggs, the price of gas, the price of housing, the price of a whole range of things.\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m working so hard to make sure I deal with those problems. And we\u2019re going to make sure that we reduce the price of housing. We\u2019re going to make sure we build 2 million new units. We\u2019re going to make sure we cap rents, so corporate greed can\u2019t take over.\n\nThe combination of what I was left and then corporate greed are the reason why we\u2019re in this problem right now.\n\nIn addition to that, we\u2019re in a situation where if you had \u2013 take a look at all that was done in his administration, he didn\u2019t do much at all. By the time he left, there\u2019s \u2013 things had been in chaos. There was (ph) literally chaos.\n\nAnd so, we put things back together. We created, as I said, those (ph) jobs. We made sure we had a situation where we now \u2013 we brought down the price of prescription drugs, which is a major issue for many people, to $15 for \u2013 for an insulin shot, as opposed to $400. No senior has to pay more than $200 for any drug \u2013 all the drugs they (inaudible) beginning next year.\n\nAnd the situation is making \u2013 and we\u2019re going to make that available to everybody, to all Americans. So we\u2019re working to bring down the prices around the kitchen table. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to get done.\n\nTAPPER: Thank you.\n\nPresident Trump?\n\nDONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND CURRENT U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We had the greatest economy in the history of our country. We had never done so well. Every \u2013 everybody was amazed by it. Other countries were copying us.\n\nWe got hit with COVID. And when we did, we spent the money necessary so we wouldn\u2019t end up in a Great Depression the likes of which we had in 1929. By the time we finished \u2013 so we did a great job. We got a lot of credit for the economy, a lot of credit for the military, and no wars and so many other things. Everything was rocking good.\n\nBut the thing we never got the credit for, and we should have, is getting us out of that COVID mess. He created mandates; that was a disaster for our country.\n\nBut other than that, we had \u2013 we had given them back a \u2013 a country where the stock market actually was higher than pre-COVID, and nobody thought that was even possible. The only jobs he created are for illegal immigrants and bounceback jobs; they\u2019re bounced back from the COVID.\n\nHe has not done a good job. He\u2019s done a poor job. And inflation\u2019s killing our country. It is absolutely killing us.\n\nTAPPER: Thank you.\n\nPresident Biden?\n\nBIDEN: Well, look, the greatest economy in the world, he\u2019s the only one who thinks that, I think. I don\u2019t know anybody else who thinks it was great \u2013 he had the greatest economy in the world.\n\nAnd, you know, the fact of the matter is that we found ourselves in a situation where his economy \u2013 he rewarded the wealthy. He had the largest tax cut in American history, $2 trillion. He raised the deficit larger than any president has in any one term. He\u2019s the only president other than Herbert Hoover who has lost more jobs than he had when he began, since Herbert Hoover. The idea that he did something that was significant.\n\nAnd the military \u2013 you know, when he was president, they were still killing people in Afghanistan. He didn\u2019t do anything about that. When he was president, we still found ourselves in a position where you had a notion that we were this safe country. The truth is, I\u2019m the only president this century that doesn\u2019t have any \u2013 this \u2013 this decade \u2013 doesn\u2019t have any troops dying anywhere in the world, like he did.\n\nTAPPER: President Trump, I want to follow up, if I can. You wanted\u2026\n\nTRUMP: Am I allowed to respond to him?\n\nTAPPER: Well, I\u2019m going to ask you a follow-up. You can do whatever you want with the minute that we give you.\n\nI want to follow up. You want to impose a 10 percent tariff on all goods coming into the U.S. How will you ensure that that doesn\u2019t drive prices even higher?\n\nTRUMP: Not going to drive them higher. It\u2019s just going to cause countries that have been ripping us off for years, like China and many others, in all fairness to China \u2013 it\u2019s going to just force them to pay us a lot of money, reduce our deficit tremendously, and give us a lot of power for other things.\n\nBut he \u2013 he made a statement. The only thing he was right about is I gave you the largest tax cut in history. I also gave you the largest regulation cut in history. That\u2019s why we had all the jobs. And the jobs went down and then they bounced back and he\u2019s taking credit for bounceback jobs. You can\u2019t do that.\n\nHe also said he inherited 9 percent inflation. No, he inherited almost no inflation and it stayed that way for 14 months. And then it blew up under his leadership, because they spent money like a bunch of people that didn\u2019t know what they were doing. And they don\u2019t know what they were doing. It was the worst \u2013 probably the worst administration in history. There\u2019s never been.\n\nAnd as far as Afghanistan is concerned, I was getting out of Afghanistan, but we were getting out with dignity, with strength, with power. He got out, it was the most embarrassing day in the history of our country\u2019s life.\n\nTAPPER: President Trump, over the last eight years, under both of your administrations, the national debt soared to record highs. And according to a new non-partisan analysis, President Trump, your administration approved $8.4 trillion in new debt. While so far, President Biden, you\u2019ve approved $4.3 trillion in new debt.\n\nSo former President Trump, many of the tax cuts that you signed into law are set to expire next year. You want to extend them and go even further, you say. With the U.S. facing trillion-dollar deficits and record debt, why should top earners and corporations pay even less in taxes than they do now?\n\nTRUMP: Because the tax cuts spurred the greatest economy that we\u2019ve ever seen just prior to COVID, and even after COVID. It was so strong that we were able to get through COVID much better than just about any other country. But we spurred \u2013 that tax spurred.\n\nNow, when we cut the taxes \u2013 as an example, the corporate tax was cut down to 21 percent from 39 percent, plus beyond that \u2013 we took in more revenue with much less tax and companies were bringing back trillions of dollars back into our country.\n\nThe country was going like never before. And we were ready to start paying down debt. We were ready to start using the liquid gold right under our feet, the oil and gas right under our feet. We were going to have something that nobody else has had. We got hit with COVID. We did a lot to fix it. I gave him an unbelievable situation, with all of the therapeutics and all of the things that we came up with. We \u2013 we gave him something great.\n\nRemember, more people died under his administration, even though we had largely fixed it. More people died under his administration than our administration, and we were right in the middle of it. Something which a lot of people don\u2019t like to talk about, but he had far more people dying in his administration.\n\nHe did the mandate, which is a disaster. Mandating it. The vaccine went out. He did a mandate on the vaccine, which is the thing that people most objected to about the vaccine. And he did a very poor job, just a very poor job.\n\nAnd I will tell you, not only poor there, but throughout the entire world, we\u2019re no longer respected as a country. They don\u2019t respect our leadership. They don\u2019t respect the United States anymore.\n\nWe\u2019re like a Third World nation. Between weaponization of his election, trying to go after his political opponent, all of the things he\u2019s done, we\u2019ve become like a Third World nation. And it\u2019s a shame the damage he\u2019s done to our country.\n\nAnd I\u2019d love to ask him, and will, why he allowed millions of people to come in here from prisons, jails and mental institutions to come into our country and destroy our country.\n\nTAPPER: President Trump, we will get to immigration later in this block.\n\nPresident Biden, I want to give you an opportunity to respond to this question about the national debt.\n\nBIDEN: He had the largest national debt of any president four-year period, number one.\n\nNumber two, he got $2 trillion tax cut, benefited the very wealthy.\n\nWhat I\u2019m going to do is fix the taxes.\n\nFor example, we have a thousand trillionaires in America \u2013 I mean, billionaires in America. And what\u2019s happening? They\u2019re in a situation where they, in fact, pay 8.2 percent in taxes. If they just paid 24 percent or 25 percent, either one of those numbers, they\u2019d raised $500 million \u2013 billion dollars, I should say, in a 10-year period.\n\nWe\u2019d be able to right \u2013 wipe out his debt. We\u2019d be able to help make sure that \u2013 all those things we need to do, childcare, elder care, making sure that we continue to strengthen our healthcare system, making sure that we\u2019re able to make every single solitary person eligible for what I\u2019ve been able to do with the COVID \u2013 excuse me, with dealing with everything we have to do with.\n\nLook, if \u2013 we finally beat Medicare.\n\nTAPPER: Thank you, President Biden.\n\nPresident Trump?\n\nTRUMP: Well, he\u2019s right: He did beat Medicaid (ph). He beat it to death. And he\u2019s destroying Medicare, because all of these people are coming in, they\u2019re putting them on Medicare, they\u2019re putting them on Social Security. They\u2019re going to destroy Social Security.\n\nThis man is going to single-handedly destroy Social Security. These millions and millions of people coming in, they\u2019re trying to put them on Social Security. He will wipe out Social Security. He will wipe out Medicare. So he was right in the way he finished that sentence, and it\u2019s a shame.\n\nWhat\u2019s happened to our country in the last four years is not to be believed. Foreign countries \u2013 I\u2019m friends with a lot of people. They cannot believe what happened to the United States of America. We\u2019re no longer respected. They don\u2019t like us. We give them everything they want, and they \u2013 they think we\u2019re stupid. They think we\u2019re very stupid people.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing for other countries, and they do nothing for us. What this man has done is absolutely criminal.\n\nTAPPER: Thank you, President Trump.\n\nDana?\n\nBASH: This is the first presidential election since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. This morning, the court ruled on yet another abortion case, temporarily allowing emergency abortions to continue in Idaho despite that state\u2019s restrictive ban.\n\nFormer President Trump, you take credit for the decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which returned the issue of abortion to the states.\n\nTRUMP: Correct.\n\nBASH: However, the federal government still plays a role in whether or not women have access to abortion pills. They\u2019re used in about two-thirds of all abortions.\n\nAs president, would you block abortion medication?\n\nTRUMP: First of all, the Supreme Court just approved the abortion pill. And I agree with their decision to have done that, and I will not block it.\n\nAnd if you look at this whole question that you\u2019re asking, a complex, but not really complex \u2013 51 years ago, you had Roe v. Wade, and everybody wanted to get it back to the states, everybody, without exception. Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives, everybody wanted it back. Religious leaders.\n\nAnd what I did is I put three great Supreme Court justices on the court, and they happened to vote in favor of killing Roe v. Wade and moving it back to the states. This is something that everybody wanted.\n\nNow, 10 years ago or so, they started talking about how many weeks and how many of this \u2013 getting into other things, But every legal scholar, throughout the world, the most respected, wanted it brought back to the states. I did that.\n\nNow the states are working it out. If you look at Ohio, it was a decision that was \u2013 that was an end result that was a little bit more liberal than you would have thought. Kansas I would say the same thing. Texas is different. Florida is different. But they\u2019re all making their own decisions right now. And right now, the states control it. That\u2019s the vote of the people.\n\nLike Ronald Reagan, I believe in the exceptions. I am a person that believes. And frankly, I think it\u2019s important to believe in the exceptions. Some people \u2013 you have to follow your heart. Some people don\u2019t believe in that. But I believe in the exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. I think it\u2019s very important. Some people don\u2019t. Follow your heart.\n\nBut you have to get elected also and \u2013 because that has to do with other things. You got to get elected.\n\nThe problem they have is they\u2019re radical, because they will take the life of a child in the eighth month, the ninth month, and even after birth \u2013 after birth.\n\nIf you look at the former governor of Virginia, he was willing to do this. He said, we\u2019ll put the baby aside and we\u2019ll determine what we do with the baby. Meaning, we\u2019ll kill the baby.\n\nWhat happened is we brought it back to the states and the country is now coming together on this issue. It\u2019s been a great thing.\n\nBASH: Thank you.\n\nPresident Biden?\n\nBIDEN: It\u2019s been a terrible thing what you\u2019ve done.\n\nThe fact is that the vast majority of constitutional scholars supported Roe when it was decided, supported Roe. And I was \u2013 that\u2019s \u2013 this idea that they were all against it is just ridiculous.\n\nAnd this is the guy who says the states should be able to have it. We\u2019re in a state where in six weeks you don\u2019t even know whether you\u2019re pregnant or not, but you cannot see a doctor, have your \u2013 and have him decide on what your circumstances are, whether you need help.\n\nThe idea that states are able to do this is a little like saying, we\u2019re going to turn civil rights back to the states, let each state have a different rule.\n\nLook, there\u2019s so many young women who have been \u2013 including a young woman who just was murdered and he went to the funeral. The idea that she was murdered by \u2013 by \u2013 by an immigrant coming in and (inaudible) talk about that.\n\nBut here\u2019s the deal, there\u2019s a lot of young women who are being raped by their \u2013 by their in-laws, by their \u2013 by their spouses, brothers and sisters, by \u2013 just \u2013 it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s just ridiculous. And they can do nothing about it. And they try to arrest them when they cross state lines.\n\nBASH: Thank you.\n\nTRUMP: There have been many young women murdered by the same people he allows to come across our border. We have a border that\u2019s the most dangerous place anywhere in the world \u2013 considered the most dangerous place anywhere in the world. And he opened it up, and these killers are coming into our country, and they are raping and killing women. And it\u2019s a terrible thing.\n\nAs far as the abortion\u2019s concerned, it is now back with the states. The states are voting and in many cases, they \u2013 it\u2019s, frankly, a very liberal decision. In many cases, it\u2019s the opposite.\n\nBut they\u2019re voting and it\u2019s bringing it back to the vote of the people, which is what everybody wanted, including the founders, if they knew about this issue, which frankly they didn\u2019t, but they would have \u2013 everybody want it brought back.\n\nRonald Reagan wanted it brought back. He wasn\u2019t able to get it.\n\nEverybody wanted it brought back and many presidents had tried to get it back. I was the one to do it.\n\nAnd again, this gives it the vote of the people. And that\u2019s where they wanted it. Every legal scholar wanted it that way.\n\nBASH: Staying on the topic of abortion, President Biden, seven states \u2013 I\u2019ll let you do that. This is the same topic.\n\nSeven states have no legal restrictions on how far into a pregnancy a woman can obtain an abortion. Do you support any legal limits on how late a woman should be able to terminate a pregnancy?\n\nBIDEN: I supported Roe v. Wade, which had three trimesters.\n\nFirst time is between a woman and a doctor. Second time is between a doctor and an extreme situation. A third time is between the doctor \u2013 I mean, it\u2019d be between the woman and the state.\n\nThe idea that the politicians \u2013 that the founders wanted the politicians to be the ones making decisions about a woman\u2019s health is ridiculous. That\u2019s the last \u2013 no politician should be making that decision. A doctor should be making those decisions. That\u2019s how it should be run. That\u2019s what you\u2019re going to do.\n\nAnd if I\u2019m elected, I\u2019m going to restore Roe v. Wade.\n\nTRUMP: So that means he can take the life of the baby in the ninth month and even after birth, because some states, Democrat-run, take it after birth. Again, the governor \u2013 former governor of Virginia: put the baby down, then we decide what to do with it.\n\nSo he\u2019s in \u2013 he\u2019s willing to, as we say, rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month and kill the baby.\n\nNobody wants that to happen. Democrat or Republican, nobody wants it to happen.\n\nBIDEN: He\u2019s lying. That is simply not true.\n\nThat \u2013 Roe v. Wade does not provide for that. That\u2019s not the circumstance. Only when the woman\u2019s life is in danger, she\u2019s going to die, that\u2019s the only circumstance in which that can happen.\n\nBut we are not for late-term abortion, period, period, period.\n\nTRUMP: Under Roe v. Wade, you have late-term abortion. You can do whatever you want. Depending on the state, you can do whatever you want.\n\nWe don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good thing. We think it\u2019s a radical thing. We think the Democrats are the radicals, not the Republicans.\n\nBIDEN: For 51 years, that was the law. 51 years, constitutional scholarship said it was the right way to go. 51 years. And it was taken away because this guy put very conservative members on the Supreme Court. Takes credit for taking it away.\n\nWhat\u2019s he going to do? What\u2019s he going to do, in fact, if \u2013 if the MAGA Republicans \u2013 he gets elected, and the MAGA Republicans control the Congress and they pass a universal ban on abortion, period, across the board at six weeks or seven or eight or 10 weeks, something very, very conservative? Is he going to sign that bill? I\u2019ll veto it. He\u2019ll sign it.\n\nBASH: Thank you.\n\nTAPPER: Let\u2019s turn now to the issue of immigration and border security.\n\nPresident Biden, a record number of migrants have illegally crossed the southern border on your watch, overwhelming border states and overburdening cities such as New York and Chicago, and in some cases causing real safety and security concerns. Given that, why should voters trust you to solve this crisis?\n\nBIDEN: Because we worked very hard to get a bipartisan agreement that not only changed all of that, it made sure that we are in a situation where you had no circumstance where they could come across the border with the number of border police there are now. We significantly increased the number of asylum officers. Significantly \u2013 by the way, the Border Patrol endorsed me, endorsed my position.\n\nIn addition to that, we found ourselves in a situation where, when he was president, he was taking \u2013 separating babies from their mothers, putting them in cages, making sure the families were separated. That\u2019s not the right way to go.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve done \u2013 since I\u2019ve changed the law, what\u2019s happened? I\u2019ve changed it in a way that now you\u2019re in a situation where there are 40 percent fewer people coming across the border illegally. It\u2019s better than when he left office. And I\u2019m going to continue to move until we get the total ban on the \u2013 the total initiative relative to what we\u2019re going to do with more Border Patrol and more asylum officers.\n\nTAPPER: President Trump?\n\nTRUMP: I really don\u2019t know what he said at the end of that sentence. I don\u2019t think he knows what he said either.\n\nLook, we had the safest border in the history of our country. The border \u2013 all he had to do was leave it. All he had to do was leave it.\n\nHe decided to open up our border, open up our country to people that are from prisons, people that are from mental institutions, insane asylum, terrorists. We have the largest number of terrorists coming into our country right now. All terrorists, all over the world \u2013 not just in South America, all over the world. They come from the Middle East, everywhere. All over the world, they\u2019re pouring in. And this guy just left it open.\n\nAnd he didn\u2019t need legislation because I didn\u2019t have legislation. I said, close the border. We had the safest border in history. In that final couple of months of my presidency, we had, according to Border Patrol \u2013 who is great, and, by the way, who endorsed me for president. But I won\u2019t say that. But they endorsed me for president.\n\nBrandon, just speak to him.\n\nBut, look, we had the safest border in history. Now we have the worst border in history. There\u2019s never been anything like it. And people are dying all over the place, including the people that are coming up in caravans.\n\nTAPPER: Thank you, President Trump.\n\nPresident Biden?\n\nBIDEN: The only terrorist who has done anything crossing the border is one who came along and killed three in his administration, killed \u2013 an al-Qaida person in his administration killed three American soldiers, killed three American soldiers. That\u2019s the only terrorist that\u2019s there.\n\nI\u2019m not saying no terrorist ever got through. But the idea they\u2019re emptying their prisons, we\u2019re welcoming these people, that\u2019s simply not true. There\u2019s no data to support what he said.\n\nOnce again, he\u2019s exaggerating. He\u2019s lying.\n\nTAPPER: President Trump, staying on the topic of immigration, you\u2019ve said that you\u2019re going to carry out, quote, \u201cthe largest domestic deportation operation in American history,\u201d unquote. Does that mean that you will deport every undocumented immigrant in America, including those who have jobs, including those whose spouses are citizens, and including those who have lived here for decades? And if so, how will you do it?\n\nTRUMP: Can I get one second?\n\nHe said we killed three people. The people we killed are al-Baghdadi and Salamani (sic), the two greatest terrorists, biggest terrorists anywhere in the world. And it had a huge impact on everything; not just border, on everything.\n\nHe\u2019s the one that killed people with the bad border, including hundreds of thousands of people dying, and also killing our citizens when they come in. We \u2013 we are living right now in a rat\u2019s nest. They\u2019re killing our people in New York, in California, in every state in the union, because we don\u2019t have borders anymore. Every state is now a border.\n\nAnd because of his ridiculous, insane and very stupid policies, people are coming in and they\u2019re killing our citizens at a level that we\u2019ve never seen. We call it migrant crime. I call it Biden migrant crime.\n\nThey\u2019re killing our citizens at a level that we\u2019ve never seen before. And you\u2019re reading it like these three incredible young girls over the last few days. One of them, I just spoke to the mother, and we just had the funeral for this girl, 12 years old.\n\nThis is horrible what\u2019s taken place. What\u2019s taken place in our country, we\u2019re literally an uncivilized country now.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t want it to be. He just doesn\u2019t know. He opened the borders nobody\u2019s ever seen anything like. And we have to get a lot of these people out and we have to get them out fast, because they\u2019re going to destroy our country.\n\nJust take a look at where they\u2019re living. They\u2019re living in luxury hotels in New York City and other places. Our veterans are on the street, they\u2019re dying, because he doesn\u2019t care about our veterans. He doesn\u2019t care. He doesn\u2019t like the military at all. And he doesn\u2019t care about our veterans.\n\nNobody\u2019s been worse. I had the highest approval rating for veterans, taking care of the V.A. He has the worst. He\u2019s gotten rid of all the things that I approved, choice, that I got through Congress. All of the different things I approved, they abandoned.\n\nWe had, by far, the highest, and now it\u2019s down in less than half because he\u2019s done \u2013 all these great things that we did \u2013 and I think he did it just because I approved it, which is crazy. But he has killed so many people at our border by allowing\u2026\n\nTAPPER: Thank you, President Trump.\n\nTRUMP: \u2026 all of these people to come in.\n\nTAPPER: President Biden\u2026\n\nTRUMP: And it\u2019s a very sad day in America.\n\nTAPPER: President Biden, you have the mic.\n\nBIDEN: Every single thing he said is a lie, every single one.\n\nFor example, veterans are a hell of a lot better off since I passed the PACT Act. One million of them now have insurance, and their families have it \u2013 and their families have it. Because what happened, whether was Agent Orange or burn pits, they\u2019re all being covered now. And he opposed \u2013 his group opposed that.\n\nWe\u2019re also in a situation where we have great respect for veterans. My \u2013 my son spent a year in Iraq living next to one of those burn pits. Came back with stage four glioblastoma.\n\nI was recently in \u2013 in \u2013 in France for D-Day, and I spoke to all \u2013 about those heroes that died. I went to the World War II cemetery \u2013 World War I cemetery he refused to go to. He was standing with his four-star general, and he told him \u2013 he said, I don\u2019t want to go in there because they\u2019re a bunch of losers and suckers.\n\nMy son was not a loser. He was not a sucker. You\u2019re the sucker. You\u2019re the loser.\n\nTAPPER: President Trump?\n\nTRUMP: First of all, that was a made-up quote, suckers and losers. They made it up. It was in a third-rate magazine that\u2019s failing, like many of these magazines. He made that up. He put it in commercials. We\u2019ve notified them. We had 19 people that said I didn\u2019t say it.\n\nAnd think of this, who would say \u2013 I\u2019m at a cemetery, or I\u2019m talking about our veterans \u2013 because nobody\u2019s taken better care \u2013 I\u2019m so glad this came up, and he brought it up. There\u2019s nobody that\u2019s taken better care of our soldiers than I have.\n\nTo think that I would, in front of generals and others, say suckers and losers \u2013 we have 19 people that said it was never said by me. It was made up by him, just like Russia, Russia, Russia was made up, just like the 51 intelligence agents are made up, just like the new thing with the 16 economists are talking.\n\nIt\u2019s the same thing. Fifty-one intelligence agents said that the laptop was Russia disinformation. It wasn\u2019t. That came from his son Hunter. It wasn\u2019t Russia disinformation. He made up the suckers and losers, so he should apologize to me right now.\n\nBIDEN: You had a four-star general stand at your side, who was on your staff, who said you said it, period. That\u2019s number one.\n\nAnd, number two, the idea \u2013 the idea that I have to apologize to you for anything along the lines. We\u2019ve done more for veterans than any president has in American history \u2013 American history. And they now \u2013 and their family. The only sacred obligation we have as a country is to care for our veterans when they come home, and their families, and equip them when they go to war.\n\nThat\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. That\u2019s what the V.A. is doing now. They\u2019re doing more for veterans than ever before in our history.\n\nTAPPER: All right. Thank you so much.\n\nBASH: Let\u2019s move to the topic of foreign policy. I want to begin with Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine, which is now in its third year.\n\nFormer President Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin says he\u2019ll only end this war if Russia keeps the Ukrainian territory it has already claimed and Ukraine abandons its bid to join NATO.\n\nAre Putin\u2019s terms acceptable to you?\n\nTRUMP: First of all, our veterans and our soldiers can\u2019t stand this guy. They can\u2019t stand him. They think he\u2019s the worst commander in chief, if that\u2019s what you call him, that we\u2019ve ever had. They can\u2019t stand him. So let\u2019s get that straight.\n\nAnd they like me more than just about any of them. And that\u2019s based on every single bit of information.\n\nAs far as Russia and Ukraine, if we had a real president, a president that knew \u2013 that was respected by Putin, he would have never \u2013 he would have never invaded Ukraine.\n\nA lot of people are dead right now, much more than people know. You know, they talk about numbers. You can double those numbers, maybe triple those numbers. He did nothing to stop it. In fact, I think he encouraged Russia from going in.\n\nI\u2019ll tell you what happened, he was so bad with Afghanistan, it was such a horrible embarrassment, most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, that when Putin watched that and he saw the incompetence that he should \u2013 he should have fired those generals like I fired the one that you mentioned, and so he\u2019s got no love lost. But he should have fired those generals.\n\nNo general got fired for the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, Afghanistan, where we left billions of dollars of equipment behind, we lost 13 beautiful soldiers and 38 soldiers were obliterated. And by the way, we left people behind too. We left American citizens behind.\n\nWhen Putin saw that, he said, you know what? I think we\u2019re going to go in and maybe take my \u2013 this was his dream. I talked to him about it, his dream. The difference is he never would have invaded Ukraine. Never.\n\nJust like Israel would have never been invaded, in a million years, by Hamas. You know why? Because Iran was broke with me. I wouldn\u2019t let anybody do business with them. They ran out of money. They were broke. They had no money for Hamas. They had no money for anything. No money for terror.\n\nThat\u2019s why you had no terror at all during my administration. This place, the whole world is blowing up under him.\n\nBASH: President Biden?\n\nBIDEN: I\u2019ve never heard so much malarkey in my whole life.\n\nLook, the fact of the matter is that we\u2019re in a situation where \u2013 let\u2019s take the last point first. Iran attacked American troops, killed, caused brain damage for a number of these troops, and he did nothing about it. Recently \u2013 when he was president, they attacked. He said they\u2019re just having headaches. That\u2019s all it is. We didn\u2019t do a thing when the attack took place, number one.\n\nNumber two, we got over 100,000 Americans and others out of Afghanistan during that airlift.\n\nNumber three, we found ourselves in a situation where, if you take a look at what Trump did in Ukraine, he\u2019s \u2013 this guy told Ukraine \u2013 told Trump, do whatever you want. Do whatever you want. And that\u2019s exactly what Trump did to Putin, encouraged him, do whatever you want. And he went in.\n\nAnd listen to what he said when he went in, he was going to take Kyiv in five days, remember? Because it\u2019s part of the old Soviet Union. That\u2019s what he wanted to re-establish, Kyiv. And he, in fact, didn\u2019t do it at all. He didn\u2019t \u2013 wasn\u2019t able to get it done. And they\u2019ve lost over \u2013 they\u2019ve lost thousands and thousands of troops, 500,000 troops.\n\nBASH: Thank you.\n\nPresident Trump\u2026\n\nTRUMP: I never said that.\n\nBASH: \u2026 I\u2019m going to come back to you for one minute. I just want to go back to my original question, which is, are Putin\u2019s terms acceptable to you, keeping the territory in Ukraine?\n\nTRUMP: No, they\u2019re not acceptable. No, they\u2019re not acceptable.\n\nBut look, this is a war that never should have started. If we had a leader in this war \u2013 he led everybody along. He\u2019s given $200 billion now or more to Ukraine. He\u2019s given $200 billion. That\u2019s a lot of money. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been anything like it. Every time that Zelenskyy comes to this country, he walks away with $60 billion. He\u2019s the greatest salesman ever.\n\nAnd I\u2019m not knocking him, I\u2019m not knocking anything. I\u2019m only saying, the money that we\u2019re spending on this war, and we shouldn\u2019t be spending, it should have never happened.\n\nI will have that war settled between Putin and Zelenskyy as president-elect before I take office on January 20th. I\u2019ll have that war settled.\n\nPeople being killed so needlessly, so stupidly, and I will get it settled and I\u2019ll get it settled fast, before I take office.\n\nBASH: President Biden, you have a minute.\n\nBIDEN: The fact is that Putin is a war criminal. He\u2019s killed thousands and thousands of people. And he has made one thing clear: He wants to re-establish what was part of the Soviet Empire. Not just a piece, he wants all of Ukraine. That\u2019s what he wants.\n\nAnd then do you think he\u2019ll stop there? Do you think he\u2019ll stop when he \u2013 if he takes Ukraine? What do you think happens to Poland? What do you think of Belarus? What do you think happens to those NATO countries?\n\nAnd so, if you want a war, you ought to find out what he\u2019s going to do. Because if, in fact, he does what he says and walks away \u2013 by the way, all that money we give Ukraine and weapons we make here in the United States. We give them the weapons, not the money at this point. And our NATO allies have produced as much funding for Ukraine as we have. That\u2019s why it\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s why we\u2019re strong.\n\nBASH: Thank you.\n\nMoving on to the Middle East, in October, Hamas attacked Israel, killing more than a thousand people and taking hundreds of hostages. Among those held and thought to still be alive are five Americans. Israel\u2019s response has killed thousands of Palestinians and created a humanitarian crisis in Gaza.\n\nPresident Biden, you\u2019ve put forward a proposal to resolve this conflict. But so far, Hamas has not released the remaining hostages and Israel is continuing its military offensive in Gaza.\n\nSo what additional leverage will you use to get Hamas and Israel to end the war? You have two minutes.\n\nBIDEN: Number one, everyone from the United Nations Security Council straight through to the G7 to the Israelis and Netanyahu himself have endorsed the plan I put forward, endorsed the plan I put forward, which has three stages to it.\n\nThe first stage is trade the hostages for a ceasefire. Second phase is a ceasefire with additional conditions. The third phase is know \u2013 the end of the war.\n\nThe only one who wants the war to continue is Hamas, number one. They\u2019re the only ones standing out (ph). We\u2019re still pushing hard from \u2013 to get them to accept.\n\nIn the meantime, what\u2019s happened in Israel? We\u2019re finally \u2013 the only thing I\u2019ve denied Israel was 2,000-pound bombs. They don\u2019t work very well in populated areas. They kill a lot of innocent people. We are providing Israel with all the weapons they need and when they need them.\n\nAnd by the way, I\u2019m the guy that organized the world against Iran when they had a full-blown kind of ballistic \u2013 ballistic missile attack on Israel. No one was hurt. No \u2013 one Israeli was accidentally killed. And it stopped. We saved Israel.\n\nWe are the biggest producer of support for Israel than anyone in the world. And so, that\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019re two different things.\n\nHamas cannot be allowed to be continued. We continue to send our experts and our intelligence people to how they can get Hamas like we did Bin Laden. You don\u2019t have to do it.\n\nAnd by the way, they\u2019ve been greatly weakened, Hamas, greatly weakened. And they should be. They should be eliminated.\n\nBut you got to be careful for what you use these certain weapons among population centers.\n\nTRUMP: Just going back to Ukraine for one second, we have an ocean separating us. The European nations together have spent $100 billion, or maybe more than that, less than us. Why doesn\u2019t he call them so you got to put up your money like I did with NATO? I got them to put up hundreds of billions of dollars. The secretary general of NATO said Trump did the most incredible job I\u2019ve ever seen. You wouldn\u2019t \u2013 they wouldn\u2019t have any \u2013 they were going out of business. We were spending \u2013 almost 100 percent of the money was \u2013 it was paid by us.\n\nHe didn\u2019t do that. He is getting all \u2013 you got to ask these people to put up the money. We\u2019re over $100 billion more spent, and it has a bigger impact on them, because of location, because we have an ocean in between. You got to ask them.\n\nAs far as Israel and Hamas, Israel\u2019s the one that wants to go \u2013 he said the only one who wants to keep going is Hamas. Actually, Israel is the one. And you should them go and let them finish the job.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t want to do it. He\u2019s become like a Palestinian. But they don\u2019t like him, because he\u2019s a very bad Palestinian. He\u2019s a weak one.\n\nBASH: President Biden, you have a minute.\n\nBIDEN: I\u2019ve never heard so much foolishness.\n\nThis is a guy who wants to get out of NATO. You\u2019re going to stay in NATO or you\u2019re going to pull out of NATO?\n\nThe idea that we have \u2013 our strength lies in our alliances as well. It may be a big ocean, but we\u2019re \u2013 (inaudible) able to avoid a war in Europe, a major war in Europe. What happens if, in fact, you have Putin continue to go into NATO? We have an Article Five agreement, attack on one is attack on all. You want to start the nuclear war he keeps talking about, go ahead, let Putin go in and control Ukraine and then move on to Poland and other places. See what happens then.\n\nHe has no idea what the hell he\u2019s talking about.\n\nAnd by the way, I got 50 other nations around the world to support Ukraine, including Japan and South Korea, because they understand that this was \u2013 this \u2013 this kind of dislocation has a serious threat to the whole world peace. No \u2013 no major war in Europe has ever been able to be contained just to Europe.\n\nBASH: President Trump, just to follow up, would you support the creation of an independent Palestinian state in order to achieve peace in the region?\n\nTRUMP: I\u2019d have to see.\n\nBut before we do that, the problem we have is that we spend all the money. So they kill us on trade. I made great trade deals with the European nations, because if you add them up, they\u2019re about the same size economically. Their economy is about the same size as the United States. And they were \u2013 no cars. No \u2013 they don\u2019t want anything that we have. But we\u2019re supposed to take their cars, their food, their everything, their agriculture. I changed that.\n\nBut the big thing I changed is they don\u2019t want to pay. And the only reason that he can play games with NATO is because I got them to put up hundreds of billions of dollars. I said \u2013 and he\u2019s right about this, I said, no, I\u2019m not going to support NATO if you don\u2019t pay. They asked me that question: Would you guard us against Russia? \u2013 at a very secret meeting of the 28 states at that time, nations at that time. And they (sic) said, no, if you don\u2019t pay, I won\u2019t do that. And you know what happened? Billions and billions of dollars came flowing in the next day and the next months.\n\nBut now, we\u2019re in the same position. We\u2019re paying everybody\u2019s bills.\n\nBASH: Thank you.\n\nTAPPER: Let\u2019s turn to the issue of democracy. Former President Trump, I want to ask you about January 6, 2021.\n\nAfter you rallied your supporters that day, some of them stormed the Capitol to stop the constitutionally mandated counting of electoral votes. As president, you swore an oath to, quote, \u201cpreserve, protect and defend,\u201d unquote, the Constitution. What do you say to voters who believe that you violated that oath through your actions and inaction on January 6th and worry that you\u2019ll do it again?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I don\u2019t think too many believe that.\n\nAnd let me tell you about January 6th, on January 6th, we had a great border, nobody coming through, very few. On January 6th, we were energy independent. On January 6th, we had the lowest taxes ever, we had the lowest regulations ever. On January 6th, we were respected all over the world.\n\nAll over the world we were respected, and then he comes in, and we\u2019re now laughed at, we\u2019re like a bunch of stupid people. What happened to the United States\u2019 reputation under this man\u2019s leadership is horrible, including weaponization, which I\u2019m sure at some point you\u2019ll be talking about, where he goes after his political opponent because he can\u2019t beat him fair and square.\n\nTAPPER: You have 80 seconds left. My question was: What do you say to those voters who believe that you violated your constitutional oath through your actions, inaction on January 6th, 2021, and worry that you\u2019ll do it again?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I didn\u2019t say that to anybody. I said peacefully and patriotically.\n\nAnd Nancy Pelosi, if you just watch the news from two days ago, on tape to her daughter, who\u2019s a documentary filmmaker, as they say, what she\u2019s saying, oh, no, it\u2019s my responsibility, I was responsible for this. Because I offered her 10,000 soldiers or National Guard, and she turned them down. And the mayor of \u2013 in writing, by the way, the mayor. In writing turned it down, the mayor of D.C. They turned it down.\n\nI offered 10,000 because I could see \u2013 I had virtually nothing to do. They asked me to go make a speech. I could see what was happening. Everybody was saying they\u2019re going to be there on January 6th. They\u2019re going to be there. And I said, you know what? There\u2019s a lot of people coming, you could feel it. You could feel it too. And you could feel it. And I said, they ought to have some National Guard or whatever. And I offered it to her. And she now admits that she turned it down. And it was the same day. She was \u2013 I don\u2019t know, you can\u2019t be very happy with her daughter because it made her into a liar. She said, I take full responsibility for January 6th.\n\nTAPPER: President Biden?\n\nBIDEN: Look, he encouraged those folks to go up on Capitol Hill, number one.\n\nI sat in that dining room off the Oval Office \u2013 he sat there for three hours, three hours, watching, begging \u2013 being begged by his vice president and a number of his colleagues and Republicans as well to do something, to call for a stop, to end it. Instead, he talked \u2013 they\u2019ve talked about these people being patriots and \u2013 and great patrons of America. In fact, he says he\u2019ll now forgive them for what they\u2019ve done. They\u2019ve been convicted. He says he wants to commute their sentences and say that \u2013 no.\n\nHe went to every single court in the nation, I don\u2019t know how many cases, scores of cases, including the Supreme Court, and they said they said \u2013 they said, no, no, this guy, this guy is responsible for doing what is being \u2013 was done.\n\nHe didn\u2019t do a damn thing. And these people should be in jail. And they should be the ones who are being held accountable. And he wants to let them all out.\n\nAnd now he says if he loses again, such a whiner that he is, that there could be a bloodbath.\n\nTAPPER: Thank you, President Biden.\n\nPresident Trump?\n\nTRUMP: What they\u2019ve done to some people that are so innocent, you ought to be ashamed of yourself, what you have done, how you\u2019ve destroyed the lives of so many people.\n\nWhen they ripped down Portland, when they ripped down many other cities \u2013 you go to Minnesota, Minneapolis, what they\u2019ve done there with the fires all over the city. If I didn\u2019t bring in the National Guard, that city would have been destroyed.\n\nWhen you look at all of the \u2013 they took over big chunks of Seattle. I was all set to bring in the National Guard. They heard that, they saw them coming and they left immediately.\n\nWhat he said about this whole subject is so off. Peacefully patriotic.\n\nOne other thing, the unselect committee, which is basically two horrible Republicans that are all gone now, out of office, and Democrats, all Democrats, they destroyed and deleted all of the information they found, because they found out we were right. We were right. And they deleted and destroyed all of the information.\n\nThey should go to jail for that. If a Republican did that, they\u2019d go to jail.\n\nTAPPER: Thank you, President Trump.\n\nPresident Biden, I want to give you a minute.\n\nBIDEN: The only person on this stage that is a convicted felon is the man I\u2019m looking at right now. And the fact of the matter is he is \u2013 what he\u2019s telling you is simply not true.\n\nThe fact is that there was no effort on his part to stop what was going on up on Capitol Hill. And all those people, every one of those who were convicted, deserves to be convicted. The idea that they didn\u2019t kill somebody, just went in and broke down doors, broke the windows, occupied offices, turned over desks, turned them over, statues \u2013 the idea that those people are patriots? Come on.\n\nWhen I asked him, the first of two debates we had \u2013 debates we had the first time around, I said, will you denounce the Proud Boys? He said, no, I\u2019ll tell them to stand by. The idea he\u2019s refusing \u2013 will you denounce these guys? Will you denounce the people we\u2019re talking about now? Will you denounce the people who attacked that Capitol? What are you going to do?\n\nTAPPER: I\u2019m going to give you a \u2013 a minute, President Trump, for a follow-up question I have.\n\nAfter a jury convicted you of 34 felonies last month, you said if re-elected you would, quote, \u201chave every right to go after,\u201d unquote, your political opponents. You just talked about members of the Select Committee on January 6th going to jail.\n\nYour main political opponent is standing on stage with you tonight. Can you clarify exactly what it means about you feeling you have every right to go after your political opponents?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I said my retribution is going to be success. We\u2019re going to make this country successful again, because right now it\u2019s a failing nation. My retribution\u2019s going to be success.\n\nBut when he talks about a convicted felon, his son is a convicted felon at a very high level. His son is convicted. Going to be convicted probably numerous other times. He should have been convicted before, but his Justice Department let the statute of limitations lapse on the most important things.\n\nBut he could be a convicted felon as soon as he gets out of office. Joe could be a convicted felon with all of the things that he\u2019s done. He\u2019s done horrible things. All of the death caused at the border, telling the Ukrainian people that we\u2019re going to want a billion dollars or you change the prosecutor, otherwise, you\u2019re not getting a billion dollars.\n\nIf I ever said that, that\u2019s quid pro quo. That \u2013 we\u2019re not going to do anything, we\u2019re not going to give you a billion dollars unless you change your prosecutor having to do with his son.\n\nThis man is a criminal. This man \u2013 you\u2019re lucky. You\u2019re lucky.\n\nI did nothing wrong. We\u2019d have a system that was rigged and disgusting. I did nothing wrong.\n\nTAPPER: Thank you, President Trump.\n\nPresident Biden, you have said \u2013 I\u2019m coming right to you, sir. You \u2013 well, you want to respond? Go ahead. I\u2019ll give you a minute to respond.\n\nBIDEN: The idea that I did anything wrong relative to what you\u2019re talking about is outrageous. It\u2019s simply a lie, number one.\n\nNumber two, the idea that you have a right to seek retribution against any American just because you\u2019re a president is wrong, is simply wrong. No president\u2019s ever spoken like that before. No president in our history has spoken like that before.\n\nNumber three, the crimes that you are still charged with \u2013 and think of all the civil penalties you have. How many billions of dollars do you owe in civil penalties for molesting a woman in public, for doing a whole range of things, of having sex with a porn star on the night \u2013 and \u2013 while your wife was pregnant?\n\nI mean, what are you talking about? You have the morals of an alley cat.\n\nTAPPER: Give you a minute, sir.\n\nTRUMP: I didn\u2019t have sex with a porn star, number one.\n\nNumber two, that was a case that was started and moved \u2013 they moved a high-ranking official, a DOJ, into the Manhattan D.A.\u2019s office to start that case. That case is going to be appealed in one.\n\nWe had a very terrible judge, a horrible judge, Democrat. The prosecutor were all high-ranking Democrats, appointed people. And the \u2013 both the civil and the criminal.\n\nHe basically went after his political opponent because he thought it was going to damage me. But when the public found out about these cases \u2013 because they understand it better than he does, he has no idea what these cases are. But when he \u2013 they \u2013 when they found out about these cases, you know what they did? My poll numbers went up way up. You know that because you\u2019re reporting it. And we took in more money in the last two weeks than we\u2019ve ever taken in in the history of any campaign, I don\u2019t think any campaign has ever taken.\n\nHundreds of millions of dollars came pouring in because the public knows it\u2019s a scam and it\u2019s a guy that\u2019s after his political opponent because he can\u2019t win fair and square.\n\nTAPPER: Thank you, President Trump.\n\nPresident Biden, you have said, quote, \u201cDonald Trump and his MAGA Republicans are determined to destroy American democracy.\u201d\n\nDo you believe that the tens of millions of Americans who are likely to vote for President Trump will be voting against American democracy?\n\nBIDEN: The more they know about what he\u2019s done, yes. The more they know about what he\u2019s done.\n\nAnd there\u2019s a lot more coming. He\u2019s got a lot of cases around the road coming around. He\u2019s got \u2013 he\u2019s got a whole range of issues he has to face. I don\u2019t know what the juries will do, but I do know \u2013 I do know he has a real problem.\n\nAnd so the fact that \u2013 could you ever think you\u2019re hearing any president say that, I\u2019m going to seek retribution? Do you ever hear any president say that he thought it might be a good idea?\n\nWhat got me involved to run in the first place after my son had died, I decided \u2013 in Iraq \u2013 because of Iraq, I said, I wasn\u2019t going to run again. Until I saw what happened in Charlottesville, Virginia, people coming out of the woods carrying swastikas on torches \u2013 torches and singing the same antisemitic bile they sang when \u2013 back in Germany.\n\nAnd what did \u2013 and the young woman got killed. I spoke to the mother. And she \u2013 they asked him, they said, what \u2013 well, what do you think of those people, the people who \u2013 the one who \u2013 the ones who tried to stop it and the ones who said, I think there\u2019s fine people on both sides?\n\nWhat American president would ever say Nazis coming out of fields, carrying torches, singing the same antisemitic bile, carrying swastikas, were fine people?\n\nThis is a guy who says Hitler\u2019s done some good things. I\u2019d like to know what they are, the good things Hitler\u2019s done. That\u2019s what he said.\n\nThis guy has no sense of American democracy.\n\nTAPPER: President Trump?\n\nTRUMP: Jake, both of you know that story\u2019s been totally wiped out. Because when you see the sentence, it said 100 percent exoneration on there. So he just keeps it going.\n\nHe says he ran because of Charlottesville. He didn\u2019t run because of Charlottesville. He ran because it was his last chance at \u2013 he\u2019s not equipped to be president. You know it and I know it.\n\nIt\u2019s ridiculous. We have a debate. We\u2019re trying to justify his presidency.\n\nHis presidency, his \u2013 without question, the worst president, the worst presidency in the history of our country. We shouldn\u2019t be having a debate about it. There\u2019s nothing to debate.\n\nHe made up the Charlottesville story and you\u2019ll see it\u2019s debunked all over the place. Every anchor has \u2013 every reasonable anchor has debunked it.\n\nAnd just the other day it came out where it was fully debunked. It\u2019s a nonsense story. He knows that.\n\nAnd he didn\u2019t run because of Charlottesville. He used that as an excuse to run.\n\nTAPPER: President Biden?\n\nBIDEN: And debunk. It happened. All you have to do is listen to what was said at the time.\n\nAnd the idea that somehow that\u2019s the only reason I ran. I ran because I was worried a guy like this guy can get elected.\n\nIf he thought they were good people coming out of that all \u2013 that forest, carrying those \u2013 those woods, carrying those torches, then he didn\u2019t deserve to be president, didn\u2019t deserve to be president at all.\n\nAnd the idea that he\u2019s talking about all of this being fabricated, we saw it with our own eyes. We saw what happened on January 6. We saw the people breaking through the windows. We saw people occupying there.\n\nHis own vice president \u2013 look, there\u2019s a reason why 40 of his 44 top cabinet officers refused to endorse him this time. His vice president hasn\u2019t endorsed him this time.\n\nSo, why? Why? They know him well. They serve with them. Why are they not endorsing him?\n\nTAPPER: Thank you, President Biden.\n\nWe\u2019re going to be right back with more from the CNN presidential debate.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nBASH: Welcome back to the CNN Presidential Debate live from Georgia.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about persistent challenges you both faced in your first terms, and you\u2019d certainly face again in a second term. President Biden, while black unemployment dropped to a record low under your presidency, black families still earn far less than white families.\n\nBlack mothers are still three times more likely to die from pregnancy related causes. And black Americans are imprisoned at five times the rate of white Americans. What do you say to black voters who are disappointed that you haven\u2019t made more progress?\n\nBIDEN: They acknowledge he made a lot of progress, number one. The facts of the matter is more small black businesses that have been started in any time in history. Number two, the wages of black \u2013 black unemployment is the lowest level it has been in a long, long time. Number three, we find them \u2013 they\u2019re trying to provide housing for black Americans and dealing with segregation that exists among these corporate \u2013 these corporate operations that collude to keep people out of their houses.\n\nAnd in addition to that, we find that the impact of, on the \u2013 the choice that black families have to make relative to childcare is incredibly difficult. When we did the first major piece of legislation in the past, I was able to reduce black childcare costs. I cut them in half, in half. We\u2019ve got to make sure we provide for childcare costs. We\u2019ve got to make sure \u2013 because when you provide that childcare protections, you increase economic growth because more people can be in the \u2013 in the job market.\n\nSo there\u2019s more to be done, considerably more to be done, but we\u2019ve done a great deal so far and I\u2019m not letting up and they know it.\n\nBASH: You have 49 seconds left. What do you say to black voters who are disappointed with the progress so far?\n\nBIDEN: I say, I don\u2019t blame them for being disappointed. Inflation is still hurting them badly. For example, I provided for the idea that any black family, first time home buyer should get a $10,000 tax credit to be able to buy their first home so they can get started.\n\nI made sure that we\u2019re in a situation where all those black families and those black individuals who provided had to take out student loans that were ballooning, that if they were engaged in nursing and anything having to do with volunteerism, if they paid their bills for 10 years on their student debt, all the rest was forgiven after 10 years. Millions have benefited from that and we\u2019re going to do a whole lot more for black families.\n\nBASH: Thank you. President Trump?\n\nTRUMP: And he caused the inflation. He\u2019s blaming inflation. And he\u2019s right, it\u2019s been very bad. He caused the inflation and it\u2019s killing black families and Hispanic families and just about everybody. It\u2019s killing people. They can\u2019t buy groceries anymore. They can\u2019t.\n\nYou look at the cost of food where it\u2019s doubled and tripled and quadrupled. They can\u2019t live. They\u2019re not living anymore. He caused this inflation.\n\nI gave him a country with no, essentially no inflation. It was perfect. It was so good. All he had to do is leave it alone. He destroyed it with his green new scam and all of the other \u2013 all this money that\u2019s being thrown out the window.\n\nHe caused inflation. As sure as you\u2019re sitting there, the fact is that his big kill on the black people is the millions of people that he\u2019s allowed to come in through the border. They\u2019re taking black jobs now and it could be 18. It could be 19 and even 20 million people. They\u2019re taking black jobs and they\u2019re taking Hispanic jobs and you haven\u2019t seen it yet, but you\u2019re going to see something that\u2019s going to be the worst in our history.\n\nBASH: Thank you. President Biden?\n\nBIDEN: There was no inflation when I became president. You know why? The economy was flat on its back. 15 percent unemployment, he decimated the economy, absolutely decimated the economy. That\u2019s why there was no inflation at the time.\n\nThere were no jobs. We provided thousands of millions of jobs for individuals who were involved in communities, including minority communities. We made sure that they have health insurance. We have covered with \u2013 the ACA has increased. I made sure that they\u2019re $8,000 per person in the family to get written off in health care, but this guy wants to eliminate that. They tried 50 times. He wants to get rid of the ACA again, and they\u2019re going to try again if they win.\n\nYou find ourselves in a position where the idea that we\u2019re not doing it. I put more \u2013 we put more police on the street than any administration has. He wants to cut the cops. We\u2019re providing for equity, equity, and making sure people have a shot to make it. There is a lot going on. But, on inflation, he caused it by his tremendous malfeasance in the way he handled the pandemic.\n\nBASH: Thank you. Another persistent challenge is the climate crisis. 2023 was the hottest year in recorded history, and communities across the country are confronting the devastating effects of extreme heat, intensifying wildfires, stronger hurricanes, and rising sea levels.\n\nFormer President Trump, you\u2019ve vowed to end your opponent\u2019s climate initiatives. But, will you take any action as President to slow the climate crisis?\n\nTRUMP: Well, let me just go back to what he said about the police, how close the police are to him. Almost every police group in the nation from every state is supporting Donald J. Trump, almost every police group. And what he has done to the black population is horrible, including the fact that for 10 years he called them super predators. We can\u2019t, in the 1990s (ph), we can\u2019t forget that. Super predators was his name. And he called it to them for 10, and they\u2019ve taken great offense at it, and now they see it happening.\n\nBut, when they see what I did for criminal justice reform and for the historically black colleges and universities, where I funded them and got them all funded, and the opportunity zones with Tim. As you know, Tim Scott was - incredible, he did a great job, a great Senator from South Carolina. He came to me with the idea and it was a great idea. It\u2019s one of the most successful economic development acts ever in the country, opportunity zones. And the biggest beneficiary are blacks. And that\u2019s why we have the best numbers with them in maybe ever, they\u2019re saying ever, I read this morning, wherever, the best numbers, he has lost much of the black population because he has done a horrible job for black people. He has also done a horrible job for Hispanics.\n\nBut, why do you see these millions of people pouring into our country and they\u2019re going to take the jobs? And it\u2019s already started. And you haven\u2019t seen anything yet. It\u2019s a disaster.\n\nBASH: 38 seconds left, President Trump. Will you take any action as President to slow the climate crisis?\n\nTRUMP: So, I want absolutely immaculate clean water and I want absolutely clean air, and we had it. We had H2O. We had the best numbers ever. And we did \u2013 we were using all forms of energy, all forms, everything. And yet, during my four years, I had the best environmental numbers ever. And my top environmental people gave me that statistic just before I walked on the stage, actually.\n\nBIDEN: I don\u2019t know where the hell he has been. The idea that, Dana, he said is true. I\u2019ve passed the most extensive, it was the most extensive climate change legislation in history, in history. We find ourselves \u2013 and by the way, black colleges, I came up with $50 billion for HBCUs, historic black universities and colleges, because they don\u2019t have the kind of contributors that they have to build these laboratories and the like. Any black student is capable in college in doing what any white student can do. They just have the money. But now, they\u2019ll be able to get those jobs in high tech.\n\nWe\u2019re in a situation where the idea that he kind of is claiming to have done something that had the cleanest water, the cleanest water? He had not done a damn thing with the environment. He \u2013 out of the Paris Peace Accord \u2013 Climate Accord, I immediately joined it, because if we reach for 1.5 degrees Celsius at any one point, well, there is no way back. The only existential threat to humanity is climate change. And he didn\u2019t do a damn thing about it. He wants to undo all that I\u2019ve done.\n\nTRUMP: The Paris Accord was going to cost us a trillion dollars, and China nothing, and Russia nothing, and India nothing. It was a ripoff of the United States. And I ended it because I didn\u2019t want to waste that money because they treat us horribly. We were the only ones \u2013 it was costing us money. Nobody else was paying into it. And it was a disaster.\n\nBut, everything that he said just now, I\u2019ll give you an example. I heard him say before insulin, I\u2019m the one that got the insulin down for the seniors. I took care of the seniors. What he is doing is destroying all of our medical programs because the migrants coming in. They want everybody. And look, I have the biggest heart on the stage. I guarantee you that. And I want to take care of people. But, we\u2019re destroying our country. They\u2019re taking over our schools, our hospitals, and they\u2019re going to be taking over Social Security. He is destroying Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nBIDEN: Where does that come from? The idea is that we, in fact \u2013 we were the only ones of consequence or not who are not members of the Paris Accord. How can we do anything when (ph) we\u2019re not able to \u2013 the United States can\u2019t get it\u2019s pollution under control? One of the largest polluters in the world, number one. We\u2019re making significant progress. By 2035, we will have cut pollution in half. We have \u2013 we have made significant progress. And we\u2019re continuing to make progress.\n\nWe set up a Climate Corps for thousands of young people will learn how to deal with climate, just like the Peace Corps. And we\u2019re going to \u2013 we\u2019re moving in directions that are going to significantly change the elements of the cause of pollution.\n\nBut the idea that he claims that he has the biggest heart up here and he\u2019s really concerned about \u2013 about pollution and about climate, I\u2019ve not seen any indication of that.\n\nAnd, by the way, with regard to prescription drugs, one company agreed that they would reduce the price to $35, which I was calling for \u2013 one, voluntarily. I made sure every company in the world, every pharmaceutical company, cannot have to pay.\n\nBASH: Thank you.\n\nBIDEN: And, by the way\u2026\n\nTAPPER: So every day millions of Americans struggle just to make ends meet. For many older Americans, Social Security provides a critical lifeline.\n\nPresident Biden, if nothing is done to Social Security, seniors will see their benefits cut in just over 10 years. Will you name tonight one specific step that you\u2019re willing to take to keep Social Security solvent?\n\nBIDEN: Yes, make the very wealthy begin to pay their fair share. Right now, everybody making under $170,000 pays 6 percent of their income, of their paycheck, every single time they get a paycheck, from the time of the first one they get when they\u2019re 18 years old.\n\nThe idea that they\u2019re going to \u2013 I\u2019m not \u2013 I\u2019ve been proposing that everybody, they pay \u2013 millionaires pay 1 percent \u2013 1 percent. So no one after \u2013 I would not raise the cost of Social Security for anybody under $400,000. After that, I begin to make the wealthy begin to pay their fair share, by increasing from 1 percent beyond, to be able to guarantee the program for life.\n\nTAPPER: So you still have 82 seconds left. Are there any other measures that you think that would be able to help keep Social Security solvent, or is just \u2013 is that one enough?\n\nBIDEN: Well, that one enough will keep it solvent. But the biggest thing I\u2019ll do, if we defeat this man, because he wants to get rid of Social Security; he thinks that there\u2019s plenty to cut in Social Security. He\u2019s wanting to cut Social Security and Medicare, both times. And that\u2019s with \u2013 and if you look at the program put forward by the House Republican Caucus that he, I believe, supports, is in fact wanting to cut it as well.\n\nThe idea that we don\u2019t need to protect our seniors is ridiculous. We put \u2013 and, by the way, the American public has greater health care coverage today than ever before. And under the ACA, as I said, you\u2019re in a circumstance where 400,000 people \u2013 I mean, 40 million people \u2013 would not have insurance because they have a pre-existing condition. The only thing that allows them to have that insurance is the fact that they in fact are part of the ACA.\n\nAnd, by the way, the other thing is we\u2019re in a situation where I talk about education for black communities. I\u2019ve raised the number, the amount of money for Pell grants by other $8,000 for anybody making under $70,000 a year, are going to be able to get $15,000 towards their tuition.\n\nIt\u2019s just \u2013 he \u2013 he just doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about.\n\nTAPPER: Thank you, President Biden.\n\nPresident Trump?\n\nTRUMP: So I\u2019ve dealt with politicians all my life. I\u2019ve been on this side of the equation for the last eight years. I\u2019ve never seen anybody lie like this guy. He lies \u2013 I\u2019ve never seen it. He could look you in the face. So \u2013 and about so many other things, too.\n\nAnd we mentioned the laptop, We mentioned \u201cRussia, Russia, Russia,\u201d \u201cUkraine, Ukraine, Ukraine.\u201d And everything he does is a lie. It\u2019s misinformation and disinformation. The \u201closers and suckers\u201d story that he made up is a total lie on the military. It\u2019s a disgrace.\n\nBut Social Security, he\u2019s destroying it. Because millions of people are pouring into our country, and they\u2019re putting them on to Social Security; they\u2019re putting them on to Medicare, Medicaid. They\u2019re putting them in our hospitals. They\u2019re taking the place of our citizens.\n\nThey\u2019re \u2013 what they\u2019re doing to the V.A., to our veterans, is unbelievable. Our veterans are living in the street and these people are living in luxury hotels. He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. And it \u2013 it\u2019s really coming back. I\u2019ve never seen such anger in our country before.\n\nTAPPER: President Biden?\n\nBIDEN: The idea that veterans are not being taken care of, I told you before \u2013 and, by the way, when I said \u201csuckers and losers,\u201d he said \u2013 he acknowledged after it that he fired that general. That general got fired because he\u2019s the one that acknowledged that that\u2019s what he said. He was the one standing with Trump when he said it, number one.\n\nNumber two, the idea that we\u2019re going to be in a situation where all these millions and millions, the way he talks about it, illegal aliens are coming into the country and taking away our jobs, there\u2019s a reason why we have the fastest-growing economy in the world, a reason why we have the most successful economy in the world. We\u2019re doing better than any other nation in the world.\n\nAnd, by the way, those 15 Nobel laureates he talked about being phony, those 15 Nobel laureates, economists, they all said that, if Trump is re-elected, we\u2019re likely to have a recession, and inflation is going to increasingly go up.\n\nAnd by the way, worst president in history \u2013 159 presidential scholars voted him the worst president in the history of the United States of America.\n\nTAPPER: President Biden, thank you so much. Let\u2019s turn to the cost of childcare, which many American families struggle to afford.\n\nPresident Trump, both you and President Biden have tried to address this issue, but the average cost of childcare in this country has risen to more than $11,000 a year per child. For many families, the cost of childcare for two children is more than their rent. In your second term, what would you do to make childcare more affordable?\n\nTRUMP: Just to go back. The general got fired because he was no good. And if he said that, that\u2019s why he made it up. But we have 19 people that said I didn\u2019t say it, and they\u2019re very highly respected, much more so than him.\n\nThe other thing is, he doesn\u2019t fire people. He never fired people. I\u2019ve never seen him fire anybody. I did fire a lot. I fired Comey because he was no good. I fired a lot of the top people at the FBI, drained the swamp. They were no good. Not easy to fire people. You\u2019d pay a price for it, but they were no good. I inherited these people. I didn\u2019t put him there. I didn\u2019t put Comey there. He was no good. I fired him.\n\nThis guy hasn\u2019t fired anybody. He never fires. He should have fired every military man that was involved with that Afghan \u2013 the Afghanistan horror show. The most embarrassing moment in the history of our country. He didn\u2019t fire?\n\nDid you fire anybody? Did you fire anybody that\u2019s on the border, that\u2019s allowed us to have the worst border in the history of the world? Did anybody get fired for allowing 18 million people, many from prisons, many from mental institutions? Did you fire anybody that allowed our country to be destroyed? Joe, our country is being destroyed as you and I sit up here and waste a lot of time on this debate. This shouldn\u2019t be a debate.\n\nHe is the worst president. He just said it about me because I said it. But look, he\u2019s the worst president in the history of our country. He\u2019s destroyed our country. Now, all of a sudden, he\u2019s trying to get a little tough on the border. He come out \u2013 came out with a nothing deal, and it reduced it a little bit. A little bit, like this much. It\u2019s insignificant.\n\nHe wants open borders. He wants our country to either be destroyed or he wants to pick up those people as voters. And I don\u2019t think \u2013 we just can\u2019t let it happen. If he wins this election, our country doesn\u2019t have a chance. Not even a chance of coming out of this rut. We probably won\u2019t have a country left anymore. That\u2019s how bad it is. He is the worst in history by far.\n\nTAPPER: Thank you, President Trump. President Biden?\n\nBIDEN: We are the most admired country in the world. We\u2019re the United States of America. There\u2019s nothing beyond our capacity. We have the finest military in the history of the world. The finest in the history of the world. No one thinks we\u2019re weak. No one wants to screw around with us. Nobody. Number one.\n\nNumber two, the idea that we\u2019re talking about worst presidents. I wasn\u2019t joking. Look it up. Go online. 159 or 58, don\u2019t hold me to the exact number, presidential historians. They\u2019ve had meetings and they voted who\u2019s the worst president in American history. One through best to worst. They said he was the worst in all of American history. That\u2019s a fact. That\u2019s not conjecture. He can argue they are wrong, but that\u2019s what they voted.\n\nThe idea that he is knowing (ph) \u2013 doing anything to deal with child care. He did very \u2013 virtually nothing to child care. We should significantly increase the child care tax credit. We should significantly increase the availability of women and men for child or single parents to be able to go back to work, and we should encourage businesses to hold \u2013 to have child care facilities.\n\nTAPPER: Thank you, President Biden. President Trump, the question was about what would you do to make child care more affordable? If you want to take your minute.\n\nTRUMP: Just you understand, we have polling. We have other things that do \u2013 they rate him the worst because what he\u2019s done is so bad. And they rate me \u2013 yes, I\u2019ll show you. I will show you. And they rate me one of the best. OK.\n\nAnd if I\u2019m given another four years, I will be the best. I think I\u2019ll be the best. Nobody\u2019s ever created an economy like us. Nobody ever cut taxes like us. He\u2019s the only one I know. He wants to raise your taxes by four times. He wants to raise everybody\u2019s taxes by four times. He wants the Trump tax cuts to expire so everybody, including the two of you are going to pay four to five times. Nobody ever heard of this before.\n\nAll my life I\u2019d grow up and I\u2019d see politicians talking about cutting taxes. When we cut taxes, as I said, we did more business. Apple and all these companies, they were bringing money back into our country. The worst president in history by far, and everybody knows it.\n\nTAPPER: President Biden?\n\nBIDEN: Look, the fact of the matter is that he\u2019s dead wrong about it. He\u2019s increased the tariff \u2013 he\u2019s increased \u2013 he will increase the taxes on middle class people. I said I\u2019d never raise a tax on anybody making less than $400,000. I didn\u2019t.\n\nBut this tariff, this 10 percent tariffs. Everything coming into the country, you know what the economists say? That\u2019s going to cost the average American $2,500 a year and more, because they\u2019re going to have to pay the difference in food and all the things that are very important.\n\nNumber two, he\u2019s in a situation where he talks about how he has not raised \u2013 he somehow helped the middle class. The middle class has been devastated by you. Now you want a new tax cut of $5 trillion over the next ten years, which is going to fundamentally bankrupt the country. You had the largest deficit of any president in American history, number one.\n\nNumber two, you have not, in fact, made any contact, any progress with China. We are the lowest trade deficit with China since 2010.\n\nTAPPER: Thank you, President Biden. Thank you, President Biden.\n\nLet\u2019s discuss an epidemic impacting millions of Americans that both of you have made a top priority in your first term, the opioid crisis. And for both of you, the number of overdose deaths in this country has gone up. Under your term, it went up. Under your term, it has gone up.\n\nFormer President Trump, despite the efforts that both of you have made, more than 100,000 Americans are dying from overdoses every year, primarily from fentanyl and other opioids. What will you do to help Americans right now in the throes of addiction, who are struggling to get the treatment they need?\n\nTRUMP: To finish up, we now have the largest deficit in the history of our country under this guy, we have the largest deficit with China. He gets paid by China. He\u2019s a Manchurian candidate. He gets money from China. So I think he\u2019s afraid to deal with him or something.\n\nBut do you notice? He never took out my tariffs because we bring in so much money with the tariffs that I imposed on China. He never took them away. He can\u2019t because it\u2019s too much money. It\u2019s tremendous. And we saved our steel industries. And there was more to come, but he hasn\u2019t done that.\n\nBut he hasn\u2019t cut the tariffs because he can\u2019t, because it\u2019s too much money. But he\u2019s got the largest deficit in the history of our country and he\u2019s got the worst situation with China. China is going to own us if you keep allowing them to do what they\u2019re doing to us as a country. They are killing us as a country, Joe, and you can\u2019t let that happen. You\u2019re destroying our country.\n\nTAPPER: So, President Trump, you have 67 seconds left. The question was, what are you going to do to help Americans in the throes of addiction right now who are struggling to get the treatment they need?\n\nTRUMP: Jake, we\u2019re doing very well at addiction until the COVID came along. We had the two-and-a-half, almost three years of like nobody\u2019s ever had before, any country in every way. And then we had to get tough. And it was \u2013 the drugs pouring across the border, we\u2019re \u2013 it started to increase.\n\nWe got great equipment. We bought the certain dog. That\u2019s the most incredible thing that you\u2019ve ever seen, the way they can spot it. We did a lot. And we had \u2013 we were getting very low numbers. Very, very low numbers.\n\nThen he came along. The numbers \u2013 have you seen the numbers now? It\u2019s not only the 18 million people that I believe is even low, because the gotaways, they don\u2019t even talk about gotaways. But the numbers of \u2013 the amount of drugs and human trafficking in women coming across our border, the worst thing I\u2019ve ever seen at numbers \u2013 nobody\u2019s ever seen under him because the border is so bad. But the number of drugs coming across our border now is the largest we\u2019ve ever had by far.\n\nTAPPER: President Trump, thank you. President Biden?\n\nBIDEN: Fentanyl and the byproducts of fentanyl went down for a while. And I wanted to make sure we use the machinery that can detect fentanyl, these big machines that roll over everything that comes across the border, and it costs a lot of money. That was part of this deal we put together, this bipartisan deal.\n\nMore fentanyl machines, were able to detect drugs, more numbers of agents, more numbers of all the people at the border. And when we had that deal done, he went \u2013 he called his Republican colleagues said don\u2019t do it. It\u2019s going to hurt me politically.\n\nHe never argued it\u2019s not a good bill. It\u2019s a really good bill. We need those machines. We need those machines. And we\u2019re coming down very hard in every country in Asia in terms of precursors for fentanyl. And Mexico is working with us to make sure they don\u2019t have the technology to be able to put it together. That\u2019s what we have to do. We need those machines.\n\nTAPPER: Thank you, President Biden. President Trump, and again, the question is about Americans in the throes of addiction right now struggling to get the treatment they need.\n\nTRUMP: Because this does pertain to it. He ended remain in Mexico, he ended catch and release. I made it catch and release in Mexico, not catch and release here. We had so many things that we had done, hard negotiations with Mexico, and I got it all for nothing.\n\nIt\u2019s just like when you have a hostage, we always pay $6 billion for a \u2013 every time we sees hostage. Now we have a hostage. A Wall Street Journal reporter, I think a good guy, and he\u2019s over there because Putin is laughing at this guy, probably asking for billions of dollars for the reporter.\n\nI will have him out very quickly, as soon as I take office, before I take office. I said by literally as soon as I win the election, I will have that reporter out. He should have had him out a long time ago. But Putin is probably asking for billions and billions of dollars because this guy pays it every time.\n\nWe had two cases where we paid $6 billion for five people. I got 58 people out and I paid essentially nothing.\n\nTAPPER: Thank you, President Trump.\n\nDana.\n\nBASH: Let\u2019s turn to concerns that voters have about each of you.\n\nPresident Biden, you would be 86 at the end of your second term. How do you address concerns about your capability to handle the toughest job in the world well into your 80s?\n\nBIDEN: Well, first of all, I spent half my career being \u2013 being criticized being the youngest person in politics. I was the second-youngest person ever elected to the United States Senate. And now I\u2019m the oldest. This guy\u2019s three years younger and a lot less competent. I think that just look at the record. Look what I\u2019ve done. Look how I\u2019ve turned around the horrible situation he left me.\n\nAs I said, 50 million new jobs, 800,000 manufacturing jobs, more investment in America, over millions \u2013 billions of dollars in private investment and \u2013 and enterprises that we are growing. We\u2019ve \u2013 by the way, we brought an awful a lot of people \u2013 the whole idea of computer chips. We used to have 40 percent of the market. We invented those chips. And we lost it because he was sending people to cheap \u2013 to find the cheapest jobs overseas and to bring home a product.\n\nSo I went \u2013 I went to South Korea. I convinced Samsung to invest billions of dollars here in the United States. And then guess what? Those fabs, they call them, to \u2013 to build these chips, those fabs pay over $100,000. You don\u2019t need a college degree for them. And there\u2019s billions, about $40 billion already being invested and being built right now in the United States, creating significant jobs for Americans all over \u2013 from all over the world.\n\nBASH: President Biden, you have 40 seconds left. Would you like to add anything?\n\nBIDEN: Yeah, I would. The idea that somehow we are this failing country, I never heard a president talk like this before. We \u2013 we\u2019re the envy of the world. Name me a single major country president who wouldn\u2019t trade places with the United States of America. For all our problems and all our opportunities, we\u2019re the most progressive country in the world in getting things done. We\u2019re the strongest country in the world. We\u2019re a country in the world who keeps our word and everybody trusts us, all of our allies.\n\nAnd our \u2013 those who he cuddles up to, from Kim Jong-un who he sends love letters to, or Putin, et cetera, they don\u2019t want to screw around with us.\n\nBASH: Thank you.\n\nFormer President Trump, to follow up, you would be 82 at the end of your second term. What do you say to voters who have concerns about your capabilities to serve?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I took two tests, cognitive tests. I aced them, both of them, as you know. We made it public. He took none. I\u2019d like to see him take one, just one, a real easy one. Like go through the first five questions, he couldn\u2019t do it. But I took two cognitive tests. I took physical exams every year. And, you know, we knock on wood, wherever we may have wood, that I\u2019m in very good health. I just won two club championships, not even senior, two regular club championships. To do that, you have to be quite smart and you have to be able to hit the ball a long way. And I do it. He doesn\u2019t do it. He can\u2019t hit a ball 50 yards. He challenged me to a golf match. He can\u2019t hit a ball 50 yards.\n\nI think I\u2019m a very good shape. I feel that I\u2019m in as good a shape as I was 25, 30 years ago. Actually, I\u2019m probably a little bit lighter. But I\u2019m in as good a shape as I was years ago. I feel very good. I feel the same.\n\nBut I took \u2013 I was willing to take a cognitive test. And you know what, if I didn\u2019t do well \u2013 I aced them. Dr. Ronny Jackson, who\u2019s a great guy, when he was White House doctor. And then I took another one, a similar one, and both \u2013 one of them said they\u2019d never seen anybody ace them.\n\nBASH: Thank you.\n\nPresident Biden?\n\nBIDEN: You\u2019re going to see he\u2019s six-foot-five and only 225 pounds \u2013 or 235 pounds.\n\nTRUMP: (inaudible).\n\nBIDEN: Well, you said six-four, 200.\n\nTRUMP: (inaudible).\n\nBIDEN: Well, anyway, that\u2019s \u2013 anyway, just take a look at what he says he is and take a look at what he is.\n\nLook, I\u2019d be happy to have a driving contest with him. I got my handicap, which, when I was vice president, down to a 6.\n\nAnd by the way, I told you before I\u2019m happy to play golf if you carry your own bag. Think you can do it?\n\nTRUMP: That\u2019s the biggest lie that he\u2019s a 6 handicap, of all.\n\nBIDEN: I was 8 handicap.\n\nTRUMP: Yeah.\n\nBIDEN: Eight, but I have \u2013 you know how many\u2026\n\nTRUMP: I\u2019ve seen your swing, I know your swing.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBASH: President Trump, we\u2019re going to\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTRUMP: Let\u2019s not act like children.\n\nBIDEN: You are a child.\n\nBASH: To you, a specific concern that voters have about you. Will you pledge tonight that once all legal challenges have been exhausted that you will accept the results of this election regardless of who wins and you will say right now that political violence in any form is unacceptable?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I shouldn\u2019t have to say that, but, of course, I believe that. It\u2019s totally unacceptable.\n\nTRUMP: And if you would see my statements that I made on Twitter at the time, and also my statement that I made in the Rose Garden, you would say it\u2019s one of the strongest statements you\u2019ve ever seen.\n\nIn addition to the speech I made, in front of, I believe, the largest crowd I\u2019ve ever spoken to, and I will tell you, nobody ever talks about that. They talk about a relatively small number of people that went to the Capitol. And in many cases were ushered in by the police.\n\nAnd as Nancy Pelosi said, it was her responsibility, not mine. She said that loud and clear.\n\nBut the answer is, if the election is fair free, and I want that more than anybody.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll tell you something \u2013 I wish he was a great president because I wouldn\u2019t be here right now. I\u2019d be at one of my many places enjoying myself. I wouldn\u2019t be under indictment because I wouldn\u2019t have been his political appoint \u2013 you know, opponent. Because he indicted me because I was his opponent.\n\nI wish he was a great president. I would rather have that.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be here. I don\u2019t mind being here, but the only reason I\u2019m here is he\u2019s so bad as a president that I\u2019m going to make America great again. We\u2019re going to make America great again.\n\nWe\u2019re a failing nation right now. We\u2019re a seriously failing nation. And we\u2019re a failing nation because of him.\n\nHis policies are so bad. His military policies are insane. They\u2019re insane.\n\nThese are wars that will never end with him. He will drive us into World War Three and we\u2019re closer to World War Three than anybody can imagine. We are very, very close to World War Three, and he\u2019s driving us there.\n\nAnd Kim Jong-Un, and President Xi of China \u2013 Kim Jong-Un of North Korea, all of these \u2013 Putin \u2013 they don\u2019t respect him. They don\u2019t fear him. They have nothing going with this gentleman and he\u2019s going to drive us into World War Three.\n\nBIDEN: If you want a World War Three, let him follow (ph) and win, and let Putin say, do what you want to NATO \u2013 just do what you want.\n\nThere\u2019s a thing called Article Five, an attack on one is attack on all, a required response.\n\nThe idea \u2013 the idea \u2013 I can\u2019t think of a single major leader in the world who wouldn\u2019t trade places with what job I\u2019ve done and what they\u2019ve done because we are a powerful nation, we have wonderful piece (ph), because of the people, not me, because of the American people. They\u2019re capable of anything and they step up when they\u2019re needed.\n\nAnd right now, we\u2019re needed. We\u2019re needed to protect the world because our own safety is at stake.\n\nAnd again, you want to have war, just let Putin go ahead and take Kyiv, make sure they move on, see what happens in Poland, Hungary, and other places along that border. Then you have a war.\n\nBASH: President Trump, as I come back to you for a follow-up. The question was, will you accept the results of this election regardless of who wins?\n\nTRUMP: Just to finish what he said, if I might, Russia \u2013 they took a lot of land from Bush. They took a lot of land from Obama and Biden. They took no land, nothing from Trump, nothing.\n\nHe knew not to do it. He\u2019s not going to play games with me. He knew that. I got along with him very well, but he knew not to play games.\n\nHe took nothing from me, but now, he\u2019s going to take the whole thing from this man right here.\n\nThat\u2019s a war that should have never started. It would\u2019ve never started ever with me. And he\u2019s going to take Ukraine and, you know, you asked me a question before, would you do this with \u2013 he\u2019s got us in such a bad position right now with Ukraine and Russia because Ukraine\u2019s not winning that war.\n\nHe said, I will never settle until such time \u2013 they\u2019re running out of people, they\u2019re running out of soldiers, they\u2019ve lost so many people. It\u2019s so sad.\n\nThey\u2019ve lost so many people and they\u2019ve lost those gorgeous cities with the golden domes that are 1,000-years-old, all because of him and stupid decisions.\n\nRussia would\u2019ve never attacked if I were president.\n\nBASH: President Trump, the question was, will you accept the results of the election regardless of who wins? Yes or no, please?\n\nTRUMP: If it\u2019s a fair and legal and good election \u2013 absolutely. I would have much rather accepted these but the fraud and everything else was ridiculous that if you want, we\u2019ll have a news conference on it in a week or we\u2019ll have another one of these on \u2013 in a week.\n\nBut I will absolutely \u2013 there\u2019s nothing I\u2019d rather do. It would be much easier for me to do that than I\u2019m running again. I wasn\u2019t really going to run until I saw the horrible job he did. He\u2019s destroying our country.\n\nI would be very happy to be someplace else, in a nice location someplace. And again, no indictments, no political opponent\u2019s stuff, because it\u2019s the only way he thinks he can win.\n\nBut unfortunately, it\u2019s driven up by numbers and driven it up to a very high level, because the people understand it.\n\nBIDEN: Let\u2019s see what your numbers are when this election is over.\n\nTRUMP: We\u2019ll see.\n\nBIDEN: Let\u2019s see. You\u2019re a whiner. When you lost the first time, you continued to appeal and appeal to courts all across the country.\n\nNot one single court in America said any of your claims had any merit, state or local, none.\n\nBut you continue to promote this lie about somehow there\u2019s all this misrepresentation, all the stealing. There\u2019s no evidence of that at all.\n\nAnd I tell you what? I doubt whether you\u2019ll accept it because you\u2019re such a whiner. The idea if you lose again, you\u2019re accepting anything, you can\u2019t stand the loss. Something snapped in you when you lost the last time.\n\nBASH: We\u2019ll be right back with more from the CNN presidential debate live from Georgia.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nTAPPER: It is now time for the candidates to deliver their closing statements.\n\nAs predetermined by a coin toss, we\u2019re going to begin with you, President Biden. You have two minutes.\n\nBIDEN: We\u2019ve made significant progress from the debacle that was left by President Trump in his \u2013 in his last term.\n\nWe find ourselves in a situation where, number one, we have to make sure that we have a fair tax system. I ask anyone out there in the audience, or anyone out watching this debate, do you think the tax system is fair?\n\nThe fact is that I said, nobody even making under $400,000 had a single penny increasing their taxes and it will not. And if I\u2019m reelected, that\u2019ll be the case again.\n\nBut this guy is \u2013 has increased your taxes because of the deficit. Number one, he\u2019s increased inflation because of the debacle he left after \u2013 when he handled the pandemic. And he finds himself in a position where he now wants to tax you more by putting a 10 percent tariff on everything that comes into the United States America.\n\nWhat I did, when, for example, he wants to get away with \u2013 and get rid of the ability of Medicare to \u2013 for the ability to \u2013 for the \u2013 us to be able to negotiate drug prices with big pharma companies.\n\nWell, guess what? We got it \u2013 we got it down to 15 \u2013 excuse me, $35 for insulin instead of $400. No more than $2,000 for every senior no matter what they \u2013 how much prescription they need.\n\nYou know what that did? That reduced the federal deficit (ph) \u2013 debt by $160 billion over 10 years because the government doesn\u2019t have to pay the exorbitant prices.\n\nI\u2019m going to make that available to every senior, all \u2013 or go longer. It\u2019s happening now, and everybody in America. He wants to get rid of that.\n\nWe have \u2013 I\u2019m going to make sure we have childcare. We\u2019re going to significantly increase the credit people have for childcare. I\u2019m going to make sure we do something about what we\u2019re doing on lead pipes and all the things that are causing health problems for people across the country.\n\nWe\u2019re going to continue to fight to bring down inflation and give people a break.\n\nTAPPER: Thank you, President Biden.\n\nPresident Trump, you now have two minutes for your closing statement.\n\nTRUMP: Like so many politicians, this man is just a complainer. He said we want to do this. We want to do that. We want to get rid of this tax, that tax, but he doesn\u2019t do anything. He doesn\u2019t do.\n\nAll he does is make our country unsafe by allowing millions and millions of people to pour in. Our military doesn\u2019t respect him. We look like fools in Afghanistan.\n\nWe didn\u2019t stop \u2013 Israel, it was such a horrible thing that would have never happened. It should have never happened.\n\nIran was broke. Anybody that did business with Iran, including China, they couldn\u2019t do business with the United States. They all passed.\n\nIran was broke. They had no money for Hamas or Hezbollah, for terror, no money whatsoever.\n\nAgain, Ukraine should have never happened.\n\nHe talks about all this stuff, but he didn\u2019t do it. For three-and-a-half years, we\u2019re living in hell. We have the Palestinians and we have everybody else rioting all over the place.\n\nYou talk about Charlottesville. This is 100 times Charlottesville, 1,000 times.\n\nThe whole country is exploding because of you, because they don\u2019t respect you. And they have to respect their president and they don\u2019t respect you throughout the world.\n\nWhat we did was incredible. We re \u2013 rebuilt the military. We got the largest tax cut in history, the largest regulation cut in history.\n\nThe reason he\u2019s got jobs is because I cut the regulations that gave jobs, but he\u2019s putting a lot of those regulations back on.\n\nAll of the things that we\u2019ve done, nobody\u2019s ever \u2013 never seen anything like \u2013 even from a medical standpoint. Right to Try, where we can try Space Age materials instead of going to Asia or going to Europe and trying to get when you\u2019re terminally ill.\n\nNow, you can go and you can get something. You sign a document. They\u2019ve been trying to get it for 42 years.\n\nBut you know what we did for the military was incredible. Choice for our soldiers, where our soldiers, instead of waiting for three months to see a doctor, can go out and get themselves fixed up and readied up, and take care of themselves and they\u2019re living. And that\u2019s why I had the highest approval rating of the history of the V.A.\n\nSo, all of these things \u2013 we\u2019re in a failing nation, but it\u2019s not going to be failing anymore. We\u2019re going to make it great again.\n\nBASH: Thank you, former President Trump, President Biden.\n\nStay with us because we have full analysis of this debate. Anderson Cooper and Erin Burnett starts now on CNN.\n\nUPDATE: A previous version of this story contained an initial, rush transcript of the debate.",

        "text": "Trump and Biden's first presidential debate of 2024, fact checked\nHere's the fact check of some of the statements made by President Biden and former President Donald Trump during the first 2024 presidential debate, which took place in Atlanta on Thursday, June 27. The two tangled on topics including immigration, the economy, abortion and their respective records. Mr. Biden seemed to ramble during many of his responses.\n\nCBS News covered the debate live as it happened.\n\nTrump claims \"we had the greatest economy in the history of our country\": False\n\nTrump: \"We had the greatest economy in the history of our country. And we have never done so well. Every- everybody was amazed by it. Other countries were copying us.\"\n\nDetails: Trump's claim is false that during his presidency the U.S. had the greatest economy in the history of the country by many of the common metrics used to judge economic performance. The claim struggles when looking at GDP. If the 2020 pandemic is excluded, growth after inflation under Trump averaged 2.49%, according to figures from the World Bank. This is far from the GDP growth under Democratic President Bill Clinton of 3.88%, according to World Bank data. Including the time period after COVID spread, that average drops to 1.18%.\n\nTrump's claim also falls short when compared to historical figures. Growth between 1962 to 1966 ranged from 4.4% to 6.6%. In 1950 and 1951, GDP ranged between 8.7% and 8%.\n\nUnder Mr. Biden, annual GDP growth is averaging 3.4%, according to the Associated Press.\n\n*An earlier version of this fact check misstated World Bank figures for growth after inflation under Trump at 2.65%, rather than 2.49%, and 1.45%, instead of 1.18%, and also rounded the growth number for Clinton. This has been updated.\n\nUnemployment\n\nTrump's claim is also false even when evaluating the unemployment rate. In February 2020, a month before the COVID pandemic affected the economy, the unemployment rate stood at 3.5% \u2014 which was the lowest since December 1969 \u2014 but not the lowest ever. When Trump's term ended, the unemployment rate was 6.3%.\n\nIn 1953, the unemployment rate fell as low as 2.5%. Under Mr. Biden, the unemployment rate is 4%, according to the most recent data from May 2024.\n\nIn January 2023 and again in April 2023, the unemployment rate was 3.4%, lower than the best month during Trump's term.\n\nStock market performance\n\nOn Jan. 19, 2021, the S&P 500-stock average closed at 67.8% above where it had been the day before Trump was inaugurated in 2017.\n\nAccording to Investopedia, at the end of President Barack Obama's first term in office, the S&P closed 84.5% higher. Additionally the S&P gained 79% during President Bill Clinton's first term, and 70% during President Dwight Eisenhower's first term. So far, under President Biden, the S&P 500 has increased almost 40%, according to calculations on June 13.\n\nBy Laura Doan and Hunter Woodall\n\nBiden claims he's the only president this century that doesn't have troops dying anywhere in the world: False\n\nBiden: \"I'm the only president this century that doesn't have any \u2014 this decade \u2014 that doesn't have any troops dying anywhere in the world.\"\n\nDetails: At least 16 U.S. service members have died while serving overseas during Mr. Biden's presidency. Thirteen U.S. service members died in an attack at the Kabul airport in Afghanistan in August 2021. Three soldiers were killed in an attack in Jordan in January of this year.\n\nBy Layla Ferris\n\nTrump claims he did not refer to U.S. soldiers who were killed as \"suckers and losers\": False\n\nTrump: \"First of all, that was a made-up quote. 'Suckers and losers,' they made it up.\"\n\nDetails: Current and former U.S. military service members have detailed to CBS News multiple instances when Trump made disparaging remarks about members of the U.S. military who were captured or killed, including referring to the American war dead at the Aisle-Marne American Cemetery in France in 2018 as \"losers\" and \"suckers.\"\n\nA senior Defense Department official and a former U.S. Marine Corps officer with direct knowledge of what was said detailed how Trump said he did not want to visit the cemetery because it was \"filled with losers.\" These accounts were backed independently by two other officials \u2014 a former senior U.S. Army officer and a separate, former senior U.S. Marine Corps officer.\n\nIn another conversation on the trip, Trump referred to the 1,800 Marines who died in the World War I battle of Belleau Wood as \"suckers\" for getting killed. The Atlantic was first to report Trump's comments in 2020. His former chief of staff John Kelly later confirmed to CNN the essence of what Trump had said.\n\nBy James LaPorta and Sierra Sanders\n\nBiden claims 40% fewer people are crossing border illegally, better than when Trump was in office: Partially true\n\nBiden: \"I've changed it in a way that now you're in a situation where there 40% fewer people coming across the border illegally; it's better than when he left office.\"\n\nDetails: Since Mr. Biden issued a proclamation banning most migrants from asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border in early June, illegal crossings there have dropped. In the past week, daily illegal border crossings have averaged roughly 2,000, according to internal Department of Homeland Security data obtained by CBS News. That's a 47% drop from the 3,800 daily average in May.\n\nDuring the height of a spike in migration faced by the Trump administration in 2019, Border Patrol recorded an average of 4,300 daily illegal crossings, government data show. But there were months during the Covid-19 pandemic when the Trump administration averaged fewer than 2,000 illegal border crossings.\n\nBy Camilo Montoya-Galvez\n\nTrump claims migrants coming to U.S. and \"killing our citizens at a level...we've never seen before\": Misleading\n\nTrump: \"People are coming in and killing our citizens at a level like we've never seen before.\"\n\nDetails: Some migrants who are believed to have entered the U.S. along the southern border in recent years have been charged with murder and other heinous crimes in different parts of the country. They include the suspect in the high-profile murder of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley.\n\nBut while the data on this question is not comprehensive, available studies have found that migrants living in the country illegally do not commit crimes at a higher rate than native-born Americans.\n\nGovernment statistics also show a very small fraction of migrants processed by Border Patrol have criminal records in the U.S. or other countries that share information with American officials.\n\nBy Camilo Montoya-Galvez\n\nOn COVID, Trump claims more people died under Biden administration than his: True, but needs context\n\nTrump: \"Remember, more people died under his administration \u2014 even though we had largely fixed it \u2014 more people died under his administration than our administration, and we were right in the middle of it, something which a lot of people don't like to talk about. But [Biden] had far more people dying in his administration.\"\n\nDetails: More than 460,000 people had died from COVID-19 by the end of the week that Biden was inaugurated in 2021, while more than 725,000 have died in the three years since then, according to data from the CDC. However, research has found that the counts of COVID-19 deaths, especially in the early days of the pandemic, were likely undercounted.\n\nBy Julia Ingram and Jui Sarwate\n\nIn discussing abortion, Trump claims former Virginia governor, a Democrat, supported killing babies: False\n\nTrump: \"If you look at the former governor of Virginia, he was willing to do this \u2014 he said 'we'll put the baby aside and we'll determine what we'll do with the baby'...meaning we'll kill the baby.\"\n\nDetails: In a 2019 radio interview then-governor of Virginia Ralph Northam, in discussing late-term abortions, addressed a hypothetical scenario in which a fetus was severely deformed or wasn't otherwise viable. He said, \"the infant would be delivered, the infant would be kept comfortable, the infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired.\"\n\nNortham did not say the fetus should be killed. Killing a newborn baby \u2014 or infanticide \u2014 is illegal in every state, and not a single state is trying to change that.\n\nBy Laura Doan and Daniel Klaidman\n\nTrump claims Biden \"went after\" his political opponent in New York \"hush money\" case to damage him: False\n\nTrump: \"[Biden] basically went after his political opponent (Trump) because he thought it was going to damage me, but when the public found out about these cases, 'cause they understand it better than he does, he has no idea what these cases are, but when they found out about these cases, you know what they did? My poll numbers went up, way up.\"\n\nDetails: There is no federal jurisdiction over a state case. The Manhattan district attorney's office is a separate entity from the U.S. Department of Justice. The department does not supervise the work of the Manhattan D.A.'s office, does not approve its charging decisions, and it does not try the D.A.'s cases.\n\nBy Pete Villasmil\n\nTrump claims he brought insulin prices down for seniors: Misleading\n\nTrump: \"I'm the one that got the insulin down for the seniors. I took care of the seniors.\"\n\nDetails: During Trump's time as president, Medicare created a voluntary program in 2020 between some plans and insulin manufacturers that agreed to cap out-of-pocket costs for insulin at $35 per month. Around half of Medicare Advantage or stand-alone prescription drug plans ended up participating by 2021.\n\nDavid Ricks, CEO of insulin drugmaker Eli Lilly, has taken credit for pioneering the idea with Trump administration officials at a congressional hearing and in an interview. In the same interview with STAT, Seema Verma, former Medicare agency chief in the Trump administration, gave Ricks the credit for the cap: \"He is an unsung hero. He was actually the mastermind of all of this.\"\n\nMedicare ended the policy in 2023, after Mr. Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act, which capped insulin costs for Medicare beneficiaries \u2014 not just for the portion of plans participating in the program. The law capped insulin costs at the same amount of $35 per month.\n\nBy Alexander Tin and Hunter Woodall\n\nTrump claims Biden wants open borders: False\n\nTrump: \"He wants open borders. He wants our country to either be destroyed or he wants to pick up those people as voters.\"\n\nDetails: When he took office, Mr. Biden reversed numerous Trump-era immigration policies, including a program that required migrants to await their asylum hearings in Mexico. U.S. Border Patrol has also reported record numbers of migrant apprehensions along the southern border during Mr. Biden's presidency. But Mr. Biden has never endorsed or implemented an \"open borders\" policy.\n\nIn fact, Mr. Biden has embraced some restrictive border policies that mirror rules enacted by his predecessor. In 2023, his administration published a regulation that disqualified migrants from asylum if they crossed into the country illegally after not seeking protection in a third country.\n\nEarlier this month, Mr. Biden enacted an even stricter policy: a proclamation that has partially shut down asylum processing along the border. His administration has also carried out over 4 million deportations, expulsions and returns of migrants since 2021, according to government data.\n\nOnly U.S. citizens can vote in federal elections. Most who cross into the U.S. illegally are not on a path to permanent legal status, let alone citizenship. Even those who apply and win asylum \u2014 a process that typically takes years to complete \u2014 have to wait five years as permanent U.S. residents before applying for American citizenship. There's no evidence to suggest that the Biden administration's border policy is based on a desire to convert migrants into voters.\n\nBy Camilo Montoya-Galvez\n\nBiden claims Trump wants to get rid of Social Security: False\n\nBiden \"[Trump] wants to get rid of Social Security. He thinks there's plenty to cut in social security. He's wanted to cut Social Security and Medicare, both times.\"\n\nDetails: Trump has repeatedly said he will try to protect Medicare and Social Security. Trump said in a March 21 Truth Social post that he would not \"under any circumstance\" allow Social Security to \"be even touched\" if he were president. Trump had said in a CNBC interview on March 11 that \"there is a lot you can do\" in terms of \"cutting\" spending under Social Security. Mr. Biden said the comments were proof Trump aimed to make cuts in the programs, but a Trump campaign spokesman said Trump was referring to \"cutting waste and fraud,\" not Social Security entitlements.\n\nBy Layla Ferris\n\nTrump claims Biden has the \"largest deficit\" in history of U.S.: False\n\nTrump: \"But he's (Biden) got the largest deficit in the history of our country.\"\n\nDetails: The national deficit was the largest it had been in over two decades under Trump's administration, not Mr. Biden's, according to data from the U.S. Treasury. The deficit peaked in fiscal year 2020 at $3.13 trillion, and declined to $1.7 trillion by the end of fiscal year 2023.\n\nBy Julia Ingram",

        "text": "4 takeaways from the first presidential debate\n4 takeaways from the first presidential debate\n\ntoggle caption Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIf some people who listened to the radio in 1960 thought Richard Nixon won the presidential debate with John F. Kennedy, then maybe people reading the transcript of Thursday night\u2019s match-up would think President Biden won.\n\nMaybe.\n\nBut elections aren\u2019t won in transcripts. The reality is, fairly or not, debates are often about optics \u2014 how the candidates present themselves, defend their records and parry attacks.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why so many Democrats are ringing the fire alarms after the first general-election presidential debate of 2024. The Biden campaign said the president had a cold to explain why he sounded so hoarse and weak. But Biden\u2019s stumbles right from the beginning played into his biggest vulnerability \u2014 his age and whether the 81-year-old is up to the challenge of handling four more years in office.\n\nThere were issues for Trump, too, as he continued to spread falsehoods and bathe in the kinds of conspiratorial grievances that have turned off many voters.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nNot much has changed the dynamics of this race; will anything that happened Thursday night make a difference either?\n\nHere are four takeaways from the first Biden-Trump debate of this campaign:\n\n\n\n1. First and foremost, let\u2019s talk about the elephant in the room \u2013 Democrats have to be wondering if they\u2019d be better off with someone else as their nominee.\n\nNeither candidate is the official nominee yet. The national political conventions haven\u2019t happened \u2014 but it\u2019s next to impossible that Democrats would replace Biden.\n\nStill, given he delivered the kind of performance Democrats feared, party leaders, strategists and many voters, frankly, had to be wondering during this debate what it would be like if any of a handful of other Democrats were standing on that stage.\n\nBiden got a bit stronger as the debate went on, especially on foreign policy. He had some one-liners, like calling Trump a \u201cwhiner\u201d when Trump wouldn\u2019t definitively say that he would accept the results of the 2024 election. But Biden often wasn\u2019t able to show vigor or consistently convey what he wanted to say. He simply couldn\u2019t deliver the kinds of happy-warrior blows with that toothy smile audiences have seen from Biden in years past.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cSometimes the spin don\u2019t spin,\u201d one Democratic strategist texted midway through the debate when asked for reaction.\n\n\n\n2. If how Biden sounded wasn\u2019t bad enough, the visuals might have been equally as bad.\n\nAn important rule of thumb for candidates \u2014 and moderators \u2014 in debates is to be conscious of how things look, of how you look, of what people are seeing at home. And what people saw \u2014 and this was predictable \u2014 was a split screen.\n\nBiden wasn\u2019t able to use that to his advantage at all, even as Trump doled out falsehood after falsehood. Instead, he looked genuinely shocked and confused, which is never a good look.\n\nTrump and his base might not care about late-night comedy, but this week\u2019s monologues are going to sting Democratic voters.\n\n\n\n3. The format \u2014 and hands-off moderators \u2014 benefited Trump.\n\nThe muting of the candidates was likely intended to make the debate calmer and not allow Trump to run roughshod over the moderators or his opponent. But it had the effect of making Trump seem more sedate than usual.\n\nTrump employed rounds of verbal jujitsu, in which he threw back his own vulnerabilities and directed them toward Biden. He was even able at one point, during a strange exchange about golf handicaps, to say, \u201cLet\u2019s not act like children.\u201d\n\nThe moderation, or lack thereof, also allowed Trump to spread falsehoods and hyperbole without being interrupted or corrected. CNN indicated before the debate that the moderators were not going to play a strong role in fact checking the candidates, and they lived up to that.\n\nThey left it to the candidates, essentially, and with Biden unable to deliver in real time and the moderators declining to, the audience was left with a salad bowl full of rotten eggs and moldy lettuce that passed for facts.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nFact check: What did Biden and Trump claim about immigration in the debate?\n\n4. This debate might not move the needle much, if at all.\n\nDespite Biden\u2019s struggles, which will understandably get the headlines, Trump had some difficult moments, too, especially in the second half of the debate.\n\nIn addition to spreading myriad falsehoods, he did little to credibly defend his conduct on and before the Jan. 6 siege on the Capitol; he used the kind of hyperbolic and vituperative language that has long turned off swing voters; and showed why many are concerned about some of his positions on the issues, especially on abortion and how the U.S. should be represented on the world stage.\n\nSo despite Biden\u2019s shortcomings, millions will still likely vote for Biden, anyway, because he\u2019s not Trump.\n\nThe bottom line is: Americans have said they are unhappy with their choices, and, in this \u2013 the biggest moment of the 2024 presidential campaign yet \u2014 it was clear why.",

        "text": "Secretary Mayorkas Announces Extension and Redesignation of Haiti for Temporary Protected Status\nWASHINGTON\u2014Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas today announced the extension and redesignation of Haiti for Temporary Protected Status for 18 months, from Aug. 4, 2024, to Feb. 3, 2026, due to extraordinary and temporary conditions in Haiti. The corresponding Federal Register Notice provides information about registering for TPS as a new or current beneficiary under Haiti\u2019s extension and redesignation.\n\nAfter consultation with interagency partners, Secretary Mayorkas determined on June 3, 2024, that an 18-month extension and redesignation of Haiti for TPS is warranted because conditions that support Haiti\u2019s designation are ongoing and that doing so was not contrary to the national interest of the United States. Several regions in Haiti continue to face violence or insecurity, and many have limited access to safety, health care, food, and water. Haiti is particularly prone to flooding and mudslides, and often experiences significant damage due to storms, flooding, and earthquakes. These overlapping humanitarian challenges have resulted in ongoing urgent humanitarian needs.\n\n\u201cWe are providing this humanitarian relief to Haitians already present in the United States given the conditions that existed in their home country as of June 3, 2024,\u201d said Secretary Mayorkas. \u201cIn doing so, we are realizing the core objective of the TPS law and our obligation to fulfill it.\u201d\n\nThe redesignation of Haiti for TPS allows an estimated 309,000 additional Haitian nationals (or individuals having no nationality who last habitually resided in Haiti) to file initial applications for TPS, if they are otherwise eligible and if they established residence in the United States on or before June 3, 2024, and have continued to reside in the United States since then (\u201ccontinuous residence\u201d). Eligible individuals who do not have TPS may submit an initial Form I-821, Application for Temporary Protected Status, during the initial registration period that runs from July 1, 2024, through Feb. 3, 2026. Applicants also may apply for TPS-related Employment Authorization Documents and for travel authorization. Applicants can request an EAD by submitting a completed Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, with their Form I-821, or separately later.\n\nHaitians who were not residing in the United States on or before June 3, 2024, are not eligible for such protection, and will face removal to Haiti if they do not establish a legal basis to stay.\n\nThe extension of TPS for Haiti allows current beneficiaries to retain TPS through Feb. 3, 2026, if they continue to meet TPS eligibility requirements. Current beneficiaries under TPS for Haiti must re-register in a timely manner during the 60-day re-registration period from July 1, 2024, through Aug. 30, 2024, to ensure they keep their TPS and employment authorization. Re-registration is limited to individuals who previously registered for and were granted TPS under Haiti\u2019s initial designation.\n\nDHS recognizes that not all re-registrants who apply for a new EAD may receive it before their current EAD expires and is automatically extending through Aug. 3, 2025, the validity of certain EADs previously issued under Haiti\u2019s TPS designation. Details will be available on USCIS.gov.\n\nIf you have one of these EADs, to get an EAD that is valid after Aug. 3, 2025, you must re-register for TPS and file Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, following the instructions in the Federal Register notice extending and redesignating Haiti for TPS through Feb. 3, 2026. If U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services approves your newly filed Form I-765, USCIS will issue you an EAD valid through Feb. 3, 2026.\n\nUSCIS will continue to process pending applications filed under previous TPS designations for Haiti. Individuals with a pending Form I-821, Application for Temporary Protected Status, or a related Form I-765 as of July 1, 2024, do not need to file either application again. If USCIS approves a pending Form I-821 or Form I-765 filed under the previous designation of TPS for Haiti, USCIS will grant the individual TPS through Feb. 3, 2026, and issue an EAD valid through the same date.\n\nThe Federal Register Notice explains eligibility criteria, timelines, and procedures necessary for current beneficiaries to re-register and renew EADs, and for new applicants to submit an initial application under the redesignation and apply for an EAD.\n\nThis extension and redesignation does not apply for anyone who was not already in the United States on June 3, 2024, and consequences continue to be enforced on those attempting to cross unlawfully or without authorization into the United States. Since the Securing the Border Presidential Proclamation and Interim Final Rule was issued in early June, over 24,000 noncitizens have been removed or returned to more than 20 countries. All irregular migration journeys, especially maritime routes, are extremely dangerous, unforgiving, and often result in loss of life. DHS will continue to enforce U.S. laws and policy throughout the Florida Straits and the Caribbean region, as well as at the southwest border. U.S. policy is to return noncitizens who do not establish a legal basis to remain in the United States.",

        "text": "Opinion | Kamala Harris Could Win This Election. Let Her.\nLike many Americans who watched the presidential debate on Thursday night, I knew when it was over that there was no way I was going to sleep. So I did something I almost never do: tuned in to the pundit commentary on cable news. I\u2019m glad I did. Not long after the debate, Vice President Kamala Harris appeared on CNN with Anderson Cooper. Watching her calmly and methodically respond to a battering ram of questions from Cooper, it occurred to me: The obvious, logical path out of the mess President Biden created with his disastrous debate performance is for him to bow out with honor and endorse his young, vigorous and talented vice president to stand in his stead.\n\nI know, I know. You think I just fell out of a coconut tree. Didn\u2019t Harris flame out in the last Democratic presidential primary, leaving just in time to avoid an embarrassing loss in her home state, California? Yes. But to win a primary you must thread the needle of introducing yourself to the base of the party while burnishing the case for your ideas and dissing the talents of your rivals, all while keeping your options open, because your opponents are also your future surrogates and allies. For women \u2014 and for Black women in particular \u2014 the gender and racial dynamics of a presidential primary race seem especially difficult to navigate.\n\nThose dynamics would play out very differently on a national stage shared with Donald Trump. There, Harris would not be hectoring a fellow Democrat over relatively small differences in policy or attempting to polish her own record in comparison with that of a governor or fellow lawmaker. She can use her true superpower: She will be a relentless prosecutor of the very clear political case against Donald John Trump, a felon, a man found liable for sexual abuse, an inveterate liar, a demagogue, a threat to our democracy and to our Constitution.\n\nI think I speak for a lot of women, probably the most decisive voting bloc in this election, when I say that I would love to see Harris cut Trump down to size. And unlike the blow she landed on Biden during the 2020 primary debate \u2014 \u201cThat little girl was me,\u201d in response to Biden\u2019s terrible answer about school busing policy \u2014 she would be in a ring with an actual bully who will be unable to help himself and will treat her with menacing disrespect. Unlike Trump\u2019s previous female debate rival, Hillary Clinton, nary a whiff of scandal has besmirched Harris. All Trump would have is personal attacks, which would only further reinforce his image as a bully. That could play especially poorly with moderate voters when directed at a mature Black woman.",

        "text": "Biden's debate disaster leaves democracy in peril\nPresident Joe Biden lost the debate last night, and he lost badly. He spoke the truth, but his voice was raspy. At times he was clear and focused as when he discussed complicated issues like immigration and Israel. But at 12 minutes into the debate, he lost his train of thought and couldn't finish his answer, switching from COVID-19 to Medicare without explanation. Throughout the 90-minute debate, he sometimes looked vacant. Very few of his answers were crisp and many sounded over-rehearsed. Former president Donald Trump repeatedly said things that were not true. He often deflected questions, including those pertaining to the assault on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. He kept returning to issues like the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan that matter to his base but not to undecided voters. None of that mattered. He was vigorous. He performed. He spoke without pausing; also, without a factual basis for his claims. But what mattered is that he projected energy and strength. A meme has emerged in this election: the \"double haters,\" people who hate both of their choices in the presidential contest. It is difficult for those of us on the left to see how anyone could fail to see that Trump is an unprecedented danger to democracy. Unfortunately, the discussion of threats to democracy did not begin until 39 minutes into the debate. He did not engage in a rant about election fraud until the last minutes of the debate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiden's strengths \u2014 his decency, the sense that he truly cares about average people \u2014 these did not translate well on the debate stage. He had no stories that conveyed his natural empathy. His hurling insults at Trump had the effect of lowering him to Trump's level. In fact, Biden's attacks robbed him of his greatest strength vis-\u00e0-vis Trump: Trump constantly trashes the country, and he did so again last night, whereas Biden still believes in the American Dream. Biden rightly, and strongly, criticized Trump for trashing America, but it was too late. Besides, a minute later, they got into a debate about golf handicaps and Biden took the bait. Ugh. Trump's weaknesses \u2014 his narcissism, his dystopian vision, his contempt for the rule of law \u2014 none of these figured prominently in the debate, which is one reason the CNN hosts should be faulted. Trump parried the questions for which he had no answers. He benefitted from a format that involved no fact-checking. He did nothing to endear himself to undecided voters. If Biden had not bombed, Trump's performance would have been viewed negatively. But Biden did bomb. Debates are rarely decisive; they tend to clarify perceptions that are already prevalent. And the perceptions that matter have next to nothing to do with issues or policy. People do not vote for a slate of policies. Party platforms were once meaningful documents, but that has not been the case for decades. Instead, debates clarify perceptions of the person.\n\nDebates are rarely decisive; they tend to clarify perceptions that are already prevalent. Tweet this",

        "text": "U.S. Presidential debate: Trump, Biden spar on economy and abortion\nA halting Joe Biden struggled Thursday to allay concerns he is too old for a second term in the White House in a fiery Presidential debate with Donald Trump marked by personal insults.\n\nA bombastic Trump lashed out at his successor, calling him a failure on the economy and the world stage. Mr. Biden looked to hit back, but his delivery was faltering as he spoke rapidly in a raspy, trailing-off voice, stumbled on his words and stared open-mouthed.\n\nHis performance, after he spent the week secluded in preparation, sparked new concern within his Democratic Party as polls show Mr. Trump is tied or ahead for the November election.\n\nAlso read | The Hindu editorial on the 2024 U.S. Presidential election as a Biden-Trump rematch\n\nIt was the first debate ever between a president and former president \u2014 and each accused each other of being history\u2019s worst.\n\nBoth men, who were each the oldest president when first elected, even accused each other of being childlike as they argued over their golf swings.\n\nMr. Biden, 81, and Mr. Trump, 78, did not shake hands as they walked to their podiums at the CNN headquarters in Atlanta. There was no live audience and their microphones were muted as the other spoke.\n\nMr. Biden hit Mr. Trump with clearly rehearsed lines as he sought to remind millions of television viewers that Mr. Trump would be the first convicted felon in the White House. \u201cYou have the morals of an alley cat,\u201d Mr. Biden said.\n\nMr. Trump, a veteran of rallies and reality television, spoke loudly as he ran through a long list of complaints about Mr. Biden\u2019s record. \u201cI\u2019m friends with a lot of people. They cannot believe what happened to the United States of America. We\u2019re no longer respected,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nMr. Trump sought to seize on Mr. Biden\u2019s delivery, saying at one point, \u201cI really don\u2019t know what he said at the end of that sentence. I don\u2019t think he knows what he said either.\u201d\n\n\u2018Slow start\u2019\n\nStopping by a Waffle House restaurant to pick up food after the debate, Mr. Biden told reporters he had soar throat but \u201cI think we did well.\u201d\n\nThe White House was clearly in damage-control mode. Vice President Kamala Harris, in a live interview on CNN, said Mr. Biden\u2019s record was \u201cextraordinarily strong\u201d but acknowledged concerns about his debate performance.\n\n\u201cYes, there was a slow start, but it was a strong finish,\u201d Ms. Harris said.\n\nKate Bedingfield, a former Biden communications director, said on CNN that \u201cit was a really disappointing\u201d evening for the president. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any other way to slice it,\u201d she said.\n\nA CNN poll found 67% of debate watchers thought Mr. Trump had won.\n\nAlso Read: Biden, Trump notch more wins as primary voters urge them to keep up the fight\n\nDemocrats are set formally to name Mr. Biden as their candidate in August in Chicago, with little way to change course unless the president himself withdraws.\n\nBut Julian Zelizer, a historian at Princeton University, said Mr. Biden\u2019s supporters would be \u201cextremely concerned.\u201d \u201cBiden fueled the basic perception that has continued to overshadow him,\u201d he said.\n\nAt a watch party in San Francisco, Hazel Reitz said she would still vote for Mr. Biden but added: \u201cI can\u2019t understand a word that he says. Isn\u2019t it sad?\u201d\n\nPersonal attacks\n\nNeither candidate laid out new policies, with most of the exchanges consisting of attacks on the other\u2019s record.\n\nIn one of the most personal moments, Biden cited accounts that Mr. Trump had described soldiers who died in the Normandy landing as \u201csuckers\u201d and noted his own son Beau, who served in Iraq and later died of cancer.\n\n\u201cMy son was not a loser, was not a sucker. You\u2019re the sucker. You\u2019re the loser,\u201d Mr. Biden said.\n\nMr. Trump denied the remarks and repeatedly accused Mr. Biden of not being coherent.\n\nOn foreign policy, Mr. Trump accused Mr. Biden \u2014 who faces a backlash from parts of his Democratic base over his support for Israel \u2014 of not helping Israel \u201cfinish the job\u201d against Hamas.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to do it. He\u2019s become like a Palestinian \u2014 but they don\u2019t like him because he\u2019s a very bad Palestinian, he\u2019s a weak one,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nMr. Trump described Mr. Biden\u2019s withdrawal from Afghanistan as the \u201cmost embarrassing moment in the history of our country\u201d and said it encouraged Russia to invade Ukraine.\n\nMr. Biden, however, noted that he was the first recent president who has not had soldiers at risk overseas.\n\nMr. Trump and Mr. Biden also locked horns over abortion and immigration, key issues for their respective bases.\n\nMr. Biden, attacking Mr. Trump for appointing justices to the Supreme Court who ended Roe vs. Wade, the decision that allowed abortion rights around the country, said: \u201cIt\u2019s been a terrible thing, what you\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nOne candidate not on the stage was anti-establishment activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who failed to meet CNN\u2019s threshold of reaching 15% in four national polls.\n\nMr. Kennedy instead spent the 90 minutes taking questions on a live stream.",

        "text": "Donald Trump and Joe Biden: The key moments in the first US presidential election debate\nJoe Biden and Donald Trump have held the first presidential debate, where the president struggled to speak and the Republican was dogged by his criminal trials.\n\nHeld in Atlanta, Georgia, the CNN-hosted debate marked a rematch four years in the making.\n\nWith one candidate's microphone turned off while the other was speaking, Mr Trump and Mr Biden slugged at each other's record in office for 90 minutes.\n\nRead the Trump v Biden debate as it happened live here\n\nThe mediators divided the debate in to subjects, but both candidates evaded questions and stuck to their favoured topics.\n\nHere's the key topics Mr Biden and Mr Trump clashed on....\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:29 Biden and Trump squabble about golf handicaps\n\nEconomy\n\nWith a hoarse voice - which his aides later briefed was because of a cold - Mr Biden started the debate by blaming Mr Trump for the state he left the economy in when he left office.\n\nMr Trump, however, praised his own record, saying: \"We have the greatest economy in the history of our country, and we have never done so well.\"\n\nHe claimed he ran a higher deficit to stop another Great Depression during the COVID pandemic, before accusing Mr Biden of doing a \"poor job,\" saying inflation is \"killing\" the country, and adding: \"It's probably the worst administration in history.\"\n\nModerators noted Mr Trump's administration approved $8.4tn in new debt, while so far Mr Biden has approved $4.3 trillion in new debt.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:12 Biden appears to stall\n\nWhen asked about tax cuts he passed that are set to expire in 2025, Mr Trump said they \"spurred the greatest economy we've ever seen just prior to COVID,\" and added: \"The country was going like never before, and we were ready to start paying down debt\".\n\nRead more: In command Trump and stumbling Biden face off in first presidential debate\n\nMr Biden then attacked Mr Trump over having the largest national debt of any president and insisted he would fix the tax system. But while saying his administration was \"making sure that we're able to make every single solitary person eligible for what I was able to do with the COVID,\" Mr Biden stumbled.\n\nHe continued to say \"excuse me - with dealing with everything we have to do with - look - if we finally beat Medicare,\" before pausing until the end of his allotted time.\n\nMr Trump picked right up on it and fired back: \"That's right, he did beat Medicaid, he beat it to death. And he's destroying Medicare.\"\n\nImage: Joe Biden appeared to freeze during the debate, and aides said he had a cold Pic: REUTERS/Brian Snyder\n\nAbortion & Roe v Wade\n\nMr Trump has taken credit for appointing Supreme Court judges who revoked the Roe v Wade ruling in 2022. It underpinned federal protections for the rights to abortions, and has been a fixture of Mr Biden's re-election campaign.\n\nWhen asked about a recent Supreme Court ruling decision to approve abortion medication despite state bans, Mr Trump supported it and insisted returning power on abortion to state governments was what \"everyone wanted\".\n\nAfter discussing how \"the states are working it out\", Mr Trump added: \"I believe in the exceptions. I am a person that believes, and frankly, I think it's important to believe in the exceptions.\"\n\nMr Biden then told Mr Trump \"it's been a terrible thing what you've done\" in overturning Roe v Wade, and said he was making it harder for women in large swathes of the country to get access to basic health care.\n\nThe president also said he supported abortions in the third trimester of pregnancy and that \"no politician should be making that decision\" on when one should take place.\n\n\"A doctor should be making those decisions,\" he added. \"That's how it should be run. That's what you're going to do. And if I'm elected, I'm going to restore Roe v Wade.\"\n\nWatch a special programme with reaction to the US presidential debate on The World with Yalda Hakim on Sky News from 6pm\n\nImage: Trump claimed that removing Roe v Wade and leaving abortion rights to states was what 'everyone wanted' Pic: REUTERS/Brian Snyder\n\nImmigration\n\nWhile time was allotted for immigration as a topic on its own, Mr Trump hammered Mr Biden on the issue throughout the debate, including after the Democrat's first answer on abortion.\n\nRead more: Trump and Biden vow tough action in rival Texas visits\n\n\"There have been many young women murdered by the same people,\" the former president said. \"He allows to come across our border.\"\n\nLater on, Mr Biden was asked why he should be trusted on immigration after a record number of illegal migrants have crossed the border from Mexico under his current administration.\n\nHe pointed to how he brought in \"significant increased number of asylum officers\", and attacked Mr Trump's record in office\n\nAfter another rambling answer, Mr Trump said: \"I really don't know what he said at the end of that sentence. I don't think he knows what he said either.\"\n\nHe then claimed that under his administration, the US \"had the safest border in the history of our country.\" In a terse moment, Mr Biden spoke about Mr Trump's previous comments on veterans, where he was alleged to have called those who died in war \"suckers and losers\".\n\nThe president got personal in evoking his son, Beau Biden, who served in Iraq before dying of brain cancer, and told Mr Trump: \"My son was not a loser, was not a sucker. You're the sucker. You're the loser.\"\n\nImage: 'My son was not a loser... You're the sucker.

I think we're going to go in and maybe take my' - this was his dream. I talked to him about it, his dream.\n\n\"The difference is he never would have invaded Ukraine. Never. Just like Israel would have never been invaded in a million years by Hamas.\"\n\nMr Biden said, \"I never heard so much malarkey in my whole life\" before defending his record on foreign policy, pointing to how \"we got over 100,000 Americans and others out\" of Afghanistan and to Mr Trump's comments on NATO.\n\nOn Israel, both candidates vowed support. Mr Biden touted his May ceasefire offer, while Mr Trump said of the president: \"He's become like a Palestinian, but they don't like him because he's a very bad Palestinian.\"\n\nRead more on Sky News:\n\nUvalde shooting police chief charged\n\n'100ft deep' sinkhole in middle of football pitch\n\nHuge streamer admits to 'inappropriate' messages\n\nImage: People attend a debate watch party at Union Pub on Capitol Hill in Washington Pic: REUTERS/Nathan Howard\n\nDemocracy and January 6\n\nWhen asked about what he would say to voters who were concerned about a possible second term for Mr Trump after the January 6th riots, the former president again touted his economic and immigration records.\n\nWhen asked the question again by the moderators, Mr Trump then made false claims about former House speaker Nancy Pelosi and about an offer of sending the National Guard.\n\nMr Biden said Mr Trump \"didn't do a damn thing\" to stop his supporters marching on Capitol Hill while the 2020 election results were being certified, saying the rioters \"should be in jail... and he wants to let them all out\".\n\nHe then called Mr Trump a \"convicted felon\" over being found guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels.\n\nFollow Sky News on WhatsApp Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky News Tap here\n\nMr Biden added: \"Think of all the civil penalties you have.

        "text": "(News) Trump v Biden: How Will the 2024 US Presidential Election Outcome Shape US-Vietnam Relations?\nWith both Donald Trump and sitting president Joe Biden having served in the White House, we have unique insight into how a second presidential term for either candidate could shape the future of US-Vietnam relations.\n\nThe 2024 US presidential election is poised to exert a critical influence not only on domestic policies but also on America\u2019s international relationships, particularly with strategic partners like Vietnam. As the largest export market for Vietnam and a crucial ally in the Indo-Pacific region, the United States holds a pivotal role in shaping bilateral trade, investment, and cooperation agendas.\n\nThe election outcome will profoundly impact these dynamics, determining future policies on tariffs, trade agreements, and broader economic initiatives between the two nations. Stakeholders and businesses on both sides are closely watching how candidates\u2019 foreign policy platforms will shape the future of US-Vietnam relations and their implications for global economic landscapes.\n\nWith both candidates having previously served a term in office, we have unique insight into how a second term for either candidate could shape the course of future US-Vietnam relations. We look at how US-Vietnam relations developed under the respective Trump and Biden administrations and discuss how the different outcomes of the 2024 US presidential election could shape future trade, investment, diplomacy, and defense cooperation.\n\nTrade and investment relations: Trump and Biden report card\n\nTrade relations under Trump\n\nDuring his term in office, Trump reversed much of the progress on US-Vietnam trade relations made by his predecessor.\n\nOne such move was his decision in 2017 to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement negotiations, a key policy position of the previous Obama administration. The TPP, which consisted of 12 Pacific countries, including the US and Vietnam, would have helped to expand bilateral trade significantly by removing technical barriers to trade and reducing tariffs.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to pull out of the TPP had ramifications that last until today. The TPP eventually evolved into the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) without the US\u2019s involvement, in the process decreasing the total GDP of members to US$10.1 trillion (without the US) from a potential US$28.7 trillion (with the US).\n\nMoreover, by withdrawing from the negotiations (as well as other actions against free trade), Trump cemented an anti-globalist and anti-free trade sentiment within the US Congress, which has made it difficult for subsequent administrations to consider joining. Despite widespread support for the US\u2019s accession by current members, the Biden administration has refrained from reentering negotiations, instead pursuing its own Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF).\n\nSection 301 investigations\n\nDuring Trump\u2019s term, his trade policy was heavily focused on scrutinizing the US foreign trade deficit. While his primary target was China, he also took aim at Vietnam, with which the US had a trade deficit of over US$38 billion in 2017. This deficit expanded to almost US$70 billion by the end of his term, and to US$104 billion in 2023.\n\nIn October 2020, the US Trade Representative (USTR) launched two Section 301 investigations into Vietnam, one into whether Vietnam was undervaluing its currency and one related to Vietnam\u2019s import and use of timber. Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 is the legislation under which the USTR can investigate alleged trade violations of foreign governments, and the section under which it imposed tariffs on over US$500 billion worth of Chinese goods in 2018 and 2019.\n\nIn a report released on January 15, 2021, the USTR concluded that Vietnam was undervaluing its currency to achieve an economic advantage and that these actions contributed to a trade imbalance with the US and other countries. As a result, the US listed Vietnam as a currency manipulator.\n\nWhile the report found that Vietnam\u2019s behavior was \u201cactionable\u201d under Section 301, the USTR also said in a statement on January 19, Trump\u2019s last day in office, that it would not take any actions in relation to the findings.\n\nTrade relations under Biden\n\nThe Biden administration has taken a considerably different approach to trade with Vietnam during his term, taking steps to expand trade and investment ties between the two countries. Total trade between Vietnam and the US has steadily grown during Biden\u2019s term in office, increasing from around US$113 billion in 2021 to US$124.3 billion in 2023.\n\nDuring Biden\u2019s first year in office, the USTR quickly resolved the disputes raised in the Section 301 investigations. In April 2021, it said there was \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d to classify Vietnam as a currency manipulator. In July 2021, it announced that no action would be taken against Vietnam, as a \u201csatisfactory\u201d agreement had been reached between the US Treasury Department and the State Bank of Vietnam. However, it also stated that it would continue to monitor Vietnam\u2019s implementation of its commitments going forward.\n\nFurther, in October 2021, the USTR stated that it had reached an agreement with Vietnam to address concerns over the export of timber to the US that had been harvested illegally to the detriment of the environment. As a result of this agreement, the USTR determined that no trade action against Vietnam was warranted.\n\nBiden has not launched any further investigations or sought any trade disputes with Vietnam during his term. The USTR also continues to leave Vietnam off the list of currency manipulators.\n\nNonetheless, due in part to the unpopularity of the agreement within the US Congress, Biden has not pursued accession to the CPTPP. This would be one of the most significant ways in which the US could expand trade with Vietnam.\n\nNotwithstanding, Biden has pursued his own trade deal with Asia Pacific nations, the IPEF. Launched in May 2022, the IPEF includes 14 founding members in the Indo-Pacific region, including Vietnam, which together cover 40 percent of the world\u2019s GDP. The IPEF seeks to develop trade between the member nations through measures such as facilitating the provision of trade licenses, reducing customs red tape, and improving regulatory transparency in the region. In particular, the IPEF seeks to expand trade in agricultural products, of which the US is a major exporter.\n\nHowever, unlike the CPTPP, the IPEF currently does not propose reducing or eliminating tariffs.\n\nIn September 2023, following a state visit by Biden to Hanoi, the US and Vietnam officially elevated bilateral relations to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP), pledging among other things to further open up each other\u2019s markets to trade and investment.\n\nIn October 2023, the US Department of Commerce (DOC) initiated a review of Vietnam\u2019s economic status as a non-market economy (NME), in response to a request from the Vietnamese government to upgrade it to a \u201cmarket-based economy\u201d. Per US law, an NME is defined as any foreign country that the DOC determines does not adhere to market principles regarding cost or prices, leading to the sale of goods within that country failing to reflect their fair value. NMEs are subject to certain antidumping and countervailing duties.\n\nIf the review, which will conclude in July 2024, finds that Vietnam can now be considered a market-based economy, it would significantly ease exports from Vietnam to the US. However, it is still unclear what the conclusion will be, given the varying interests between different stakeholders on the matter.\n\nInvestment and business cooperation under Trump\n\nDuring Trump\u2019s tenure, US investment in Vietnam grew steadily. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), the US direct investment position in Vietnam grew from US$2.46 billion in 2017 to US$2.53 billion in 2020. The highest level it reached during Trump\u2019s term was US$2.9 billion in 2018.\n\nMeanwhile, the total assets of majority-owned foreign affiliates of US multinational enterprises (MNEs) in Vietnam grew from US$13 billion in 2017 to US$18.9 billion in 2021 (although it fell to just US$12.8 billion in 2020 due to the impact of the pandemic). The number of employees of US MNE affiliates in Vietnam also grew from 54,700 in 2017 to 75,700 in 2021.\n\nThe Trump administration placed a strong emphasis on energy cooperation. In 2019, the US and Vietnam signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), establishing a comprehensive energy cooperation partnership to facilitate cooperation on energy markets. Trump also heavily pushed for Vietnam to increase imports of American liquified natural gas (LNG) as a means of balancing the trade deficit and encouraged US energy companies to expand in the Vietnamese market. Vietnam\u2019s fast-growing economy is still heavily reliant on LNG and other fossil fuels, despite efforts to green its economy.\n\nFollowing the signing of the MoU, Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc agreed to assign US utility company AES Corporation to be the major investor in the US$5 billion Son My II Gas Power Plant in the southeastern province of Binh Thuan under a build-operate-transfer (BOT) contract. The plant will reportedly be required to import nearly US$2 billion worth of LNG from the US each year.\n\nOther US energy companies such as ExxonMobil have also explored opportunities in Vietnam\u2019s energy sector, including investing in LNG-to-power projects.\n\nInvestment and business cooperation under Biden\n\nUS investment in Vietnam has increased further in the years since Biden took office, with the US\u2019s total direct investment position in the country reaching US$3.5 billion in 2022.\n\nBiden has actively sought to promote business cooperation and investment with Vietnam and the wider Pacific region during his term, in areas such as clean energy, high-end technology (in particular semiconductors), and digital industries.\n\nOne of the pillars of the IPEF is the Fair Economy Agreement, which aims to create a more \u201ctransparent and predictable\u201d trade and investment environment by preventing and combatting financial crime, improving tax administration and transparency, and increasing cooperation and information sharing on these issues.\n\nMeanwhile, the US-Vietnam CSP aims to foster robust investment and business collaboration between the two nations, with a particular emphasis on advancing science, technology, innovation, and digital infrastructure. A cornerstone of this partnership is the development of Vietnam\u2019s semiconductor industry, recognized for its potential to enhance global supply chains.\n\nThe Biden administration\u2019s commitment to supporting Vietnam in this endeavor includes substantial initiatives funded through the International Technology Security and Innovation Fund (ITSI Fund), part of the CHIPS Act. Some of these funds, amounting to US$500 million over five years, will aid in fortifying Vietnam\u2019s semiconductor ecosystem, regulatory framework, and workforce development. It has also set aside an initial seed funding of US$2 million to establish teaching labs and training courses focused on semiconductor assembly, testing, and packaging (ATP) in Vietnam, crucial for skill development in this sector.\n\nFurthermore, the CSP envisions comprehensive cooperation in promoting secure and reliable digital infrastructure across Vietnam, which is poised to catalyze opportunities for digital capability enhancement and foster growth in the country\u2019s digital economy. Per the CSP White House fact sheet, initiatives include exploring the establishment of an Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) training lab and ensuring the adoption of emerging technologies. These efforts underscore a shared commitment to advancing innovation and entrepreneurship, paving the way for sustained collaboration between US and Vietnamese industries in critical and emerging technologies.\n\n2. US-Vietnam trade relations under a future Trump and Biden presidency\n\nUnder a second Trump term\n\nA second Trump term could have significant implications for US-Vietnam trade relations. Given his anti-globalist stance and ongoing criticism of trade deficits, the prospects for a new Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Vietnam appear slim. Trump\u2019s consistent emphasis on reducing trade deficits suggests his administration could reopen Section 301 investigations into Vietnamese goods or trade practices. Given that the trade deficit with Vietnam has continued to grow since his previous term in office, the Trump administration might perceive renewed investigations as a necessary measure to address this issue.\n\nFurthermore, Trump has proposed a universal baseline tariff of 10 percent on most imported foreign goods as part of his 2024 campaign. This policy aims to protect American industries and address unfair trading practices, including currency manipulation. While this tariff would not specifically target Vietnam, Vietnamese exporters are particularly vulnerable to the potential impact of such a policy, as the US is Vietnam\u2019s largest export market and a major exporter of the types of goods that are likely to be targeted for additional tariffs. With Vietnam previously labeled a currency manipulator by the first Trump administration, it is likely to be a prime candidate for additional tariffs under a counter-currency manipulation mechanism proposed as part of his trade policy if he wins a second term.\n\nA potential consequence of an increasingly protectionist US under Trump could be that Vietnam seeks to further strengthen its trade relations with China. This shift could involve deeper economic cooperation and increased trade volumes to compensate for potential losses in the US market. However, Vietnam would need to navigate its complex geopolitical relationship with China, balancing economic benefits with national security concerns.\n\nUnder a second Biden term\n\nA second Biden term is likely to see continued efforts to improve bilateral trade relations between the US and Vietnam, a crucial part of Biden\u2019s commitment to fostering stronger economic ties with the wider Indo-Pacific region. This is evident from the Biden administration\u2019s continued commitment to advancing the IPEF, as well as continued collaboration with the Vietnamese government to enhance trade relations. Under a second term, this partnership could include further efforts to streamline trade processes, improve supply chain connectivity, and enhance regulatory frameworks to facilitate smoother trade flows.\n\nHowever, Biden\u2019s reluctance to consider CPTPP membership or a bilateral FTA with Vietnam suggests that progress could be limited. Such steps would lead to significant tariff reductions, but their absence suggests that the Biden administration is focusing on other avenues to strengthen trade without fully committing to these broader or bilateral trade deals.\n\nMoreover, there are underlying uncertainties primarily linked to the complex dynamics of US-China trade relations. Evidence suggests that some Chinese exporters are circumventing US tariffs by routing goods through Vietnam. World Bank data and economic analysts have noted a correlation between increased Vietnamese imports from China and subsequent exports from Vietnam to the US. This trend could pose a challenge for Vietnam if the Biden administration intensifies efforts to prevent such tariff circumvention. Given that Biden has expanded tariffs on Chinese goods during his term, a second term could see an escalation of US-China trade tensions, potentially leading to more stringent measures to address these circumvention practices.\n\nIf the US imposes stricter controls on imports from third countries suspected of acting as conduits for Chinese goods, Vietnam\u2019s exports could be caught in the crosshairs. This would not only impact Vietnam\u2019s export economy but also strain the US-Vietnam trade relationship.\n\n3. Diplomacy and defense relations: Trump and Biden report card\n\nDiplomacy and defense under Trump\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s critical stance on global trade and his isolationist attitude, he and his administration continued to regard Vietnam as an important partner to the US in the Pacific region.\n\nHis term saw several high-profile diplomatic engagements between US and Vietnamese officials, with Trump himself visiting Vietnam in November 2017, after attending the APEC Summit Week. The US Secretary of Defense under Trump, James Mattis, made two visits to Hanoi in 2018, to further develop bilateral military ties. On his first visit, Mattis called the US and Vietnam \u201clike-minded partners\u201d, stating that they \u201cshare values based on mutual respect and common interests, including freedom of navigation, respect for international law, and recognition of national sovereignty.\u201d\n\nUS-Vietnam defense relations in recent decades have been shaped in large part by the legacy of the Vietnamese War, in particular war remediation. The Trump administration oversaw the continuation of these efforts. In early 2018, USAID signed agreements with Vietnam\u2019s Ministry of National Defense for a five-year US$183 million dioxin (a component of Agent Orange) cleanup project at the Bien Hoa Airbase near Ho Chih Minh City.\n\nThe other core aspect of the US and Vietnam\u2019s defense collaboration is the joint perceived threat of China. China and Vietnam share overlapping territorial claims in the South China Sea, which has led to a decades-long dispute involving intermittent military posturing and disruption of each other\u2019s operations in the region.\n\nVietnam\u2019s dispute with China dovetails with the US\u2019s broader security concerns and desire to contain Chinese influence in the Indo-Pacific region. This shared strategic interest has led to increased defense ties, with Vietnam seeking to modernize its military capabilities. The US has become a key partner in this effort, providing Vietnam with defense equipment and training, which is seen as a counterbalance to China\u2019s growing influence.\n\nTrump built upon the progress made by predecessors to increase US influence in the Indo-Pacific. At the end of 2017, his administration launched the \u201cFree and Open Indo-Pacific\u201d initiative, adopting various concepts from Obama\u2019s \u201cRebalance to Asia and the Pacific\u201d strategy. The initiative formed part of Trump\u2019s National Security Strategy (NSS), which classified Vietnam as a \u201cgrowing security and economic partner\u201d.\n\nThe US made several arms transfers to Vietnam during Trump\u2019s term in office. According to the US Department of Defense (DOD), between 2016 and 2021, the US authorized the permanent export of US$29.8 million in defense articles to Vietnam. In 2018, the US provided US$81.5 million in foreign military financing to \u201csupport the Indo-Pacific Strategy\u201d.\n\nDiplomacy and defense under Biden\n\nUS-Vietnam defense relations continued to see healthy development after Biden took office in late January 2021, aided by his more globalist worldview and softer stance on Vietnam trade. US military support to Vietnam enjoyed continuity, with the country receiving a total of US$104 billion in State Department-funded security assistance under the Foreign Military Financing program between 2017 and 2023.\n\nIn September 2023, the Biden administration was in talks to conclude an arms deal with Vietnam, reportedly one of the largest in history between ex-Cold War adversaries. While the deal has not yet come to fruition, it suggests that the Biden administration is keen to advance military cooperation with Vietnam\n\nThe US-Vietnam CSP signed in September 2023 also included commitments to advance cooperation on security and defense, including further cooperation in defense trade. The US also stated that it is \u201ccommitted to continuing to assist Vietnam to develop its self-reliant defense capabilities\u201d, signaling continued military support.\n\nIt is important to note that despite shared goals in the South China Sea, Vietnam maintains a policy of strategic non-alignment. While it has engaged in defense cooperation, it has not formed formal military alliances, reflecting its complex relationship with China, which includes deep economic ties and a shared border.\n\nFurther, Vietnam has also increasingly relied on arms purchases from Russia, angering the US. Vietnam has historically relied on Russia for arms supplies but has sought to reduce this reliance in recent years. However, Vietnam has continued to purchase arms from Russia, due to their lower cost than US arms and the fact that US supplies may not be compatible with its existing Russian systems.\n\nThis reliance on Russian arms may put Vietnam at risk of violating US sanctions. Under the Countering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), which was enacted in 2017, countries that engage in significant transactions with Russia\u2019s defense or intelligence sectors could face US sanctions. This has placed Vietnam in a challenging position, as it seeks to modernize its military while balancing its defense relationships with both the US and Russia. The continuation of arms purchases from Russia by Vietnam could potentially lead to sanctions or other punitive measures from the US, complicating the bilateral defense and business relations between the two countries.\n\nDuring a recent visit by Russian President Vladimir Putin to Vietnam, a series of agreements were signed, including those aimed at bolstering cooperation in various sectors, though none explicitly mentioned defense. Nevertheless, the visit garnered a strong reaction from the US with a spokesperson from the Embassy in Hanoi telling media that \u201cNo country should give Putin a platform to promote his war of aggression and otherwise allow him to normalize his atrocities\u201d.\n\nHowever, while visiting Vietnam a few days after Putin\u2019s trip, US Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and Pacific Affairs Daniel Kritenbrink stated that trust between the US and Vietnam was at an \u201call-time high\u201d and that the US respected Vietnam\u2019s independence in its decisions over its security strategy.\n\n4. The future of US-Vietnam diplomacy and defense relations\n\nUnder a second Trump term\n\nIf Donald Trump were to serve a second term, US-Vietnam defense relations could take a distinct path shaped by his \u201cAmerica First\u201d stance and critical view of US involvement in international conflicts. Despite recognizing Vietnam as a crucial partner in the Indo-Pacific during his first term, Trump\u2019s overall isolationist attitude might undermine efforts to deepen collaboration. His administration\u2019s focus on bilateral deals over multilateral alliances could lead to more transactional and less comprehensive engagement with Vietnam.\n\nHowever, Trump\u2019s softer approach towards Russia, exemplified by his appeasement and even occasional praise of Putin, suggests that Vietnam might not face US sanctions under the CAATSA for purchasing Russian weapons. This could provide Vietnam with more flexibility in its defense procurement, avoiding the complexities and potential fallout of violating US sanctions.\n\nDespite these challenges, Trump would likely continue to support Vietnam in defense matters, given the shared strategic interest in countering China\u2019s influence in the South China Sea. His administration might continue to provide military equipment and training, viewing Vietnam as a key partner in maintaining regional stability. However, Trump\u2019s unpredictable foreign policy and possible withdrawal from broader strategic commitments could weaken the US\u2019s image in the Indo-Pacific, potentially eroding the trust and cooperation that had been building between the US and Vietnam.\n\nUnder a second Biden term\n\nA second term for Biden would likely see a continuation and deepening of US-Vietnam defense relations, underpinned by his administration\u2019s strong foreign policy stance in the Indo-Pacific and commitment to supporting Vietnam\u2019s defense capabilities. Biden\u2019s globalist outlook and emphasis on multilateralism could foster a more stable and predictable partnership with Vietnam. The potential for a significant arms deal, as hinted in ongoing talks, reflects Biden\u2019s intent to advance military cooperation with Vietnam.\n\nHowever, Biden\u2019s firm stance against Russia, driven by the conflict in Ukraine, might lead to stricter enforcement of CAATSA sanctions. Should Biden enforce these sanctions, it could strain US-Vietnam ties, complicating the delicate balance Vietnam maintains in its defense relationships with both the US and Russia. Biden\u2019s administration would need to navigate this carefully, potentially offering more robust and compatible defense alternatives to Russian equipment to mitigate the impact on Vietnam\u2019s military modernization efforts.\n\nDespite these potential hurdles, Biden\u2019s strong support for Vietnam\u2019s self-reliant defense capabilities and strategic importance in the Indo-Pacific would likely ensure continued robust defense collaboration.\n\n5. Preparing for either outcome: Considerations for businesses\n\nBusinesses preparing for potential second terms under either Trump or Biden need to consider several key factors that could impact US-Vietnam trade and investment relations.\n\nUnder a hypothetical second Trump term, businesses should brace for the introduction of new tariffs, including the possibility of a 10 percent universal tariff. This policy could significantly escalate trade tensions and increase costs for businesses reliant on imported goods from Vietnam, impacting their competitiveness and profitability.\n\nTrump\u2019s anti-globalist stance and skepticism toward multilateral trade agreements suggest a less favorable environment for comprehensive trade deals like the TPP or bilateral FTAs. This makes the reduction of tariffs and barriers unlikely, limiting opportunities for businesses seeking expanded market access.\n\nMoreover, under Trump, there is a potential for renewed Section 301 investigations targeting Vietnam\u2019s trade practices, similar to those initiated during his first term. This could lead to increased regulatory scrutiny and potential tariffs on Vietnamese goods, further complicating business operations and supply chains.\n\nIn contrast, a second Biden term would likely maintain a more globalist stance, focusing on enhancing US-Vietnam trade relations through initiatives like the IPEF. Biden\u2019s approach also emphasizes collaboration on emerging technologies, digital industries, and clean energy. This presents opportunities for businesses involved in these sectors to benefit from increased investment and cooperation initiatives supported by the US government. The emphasis on green energy and technology under Biden could open new avenues for partnerships and growth in these high-demand sectors.\n\nHowever, businesses must also navigate potential geopolitical tensions, particularly in the South China Sea. Biden\u2019s more interventionist stance toward China and the Indo-Pacific could lead to heightened tensions and potentially impact supply chains and businesses operating in the region. Increased military activity and geopolitical uncertainty may disrupt supply chains and market stability, requiring businesses to adopt flexible strategies to mitigate risks.\n\nSource: Vietnam Briefing",

MARIO TAMA / AFP\n\nA halting Joe Biden struggled Thursday, June 27, to hold off a forceful offensive from Donald Trump as the two traded personal insults in the fiery first debate of a razor-close presidential race.\n\nA bombastic Trump lashed out at his successor, calling him a failure on the economy and the world stage. Biden looked to hit back but his delivery was hesitant as he spoke rapidly in a soft, trailing-off voice and stumbled on his words several times.\n\nIt was the first debate ever between a president and former president \u2013 and each accused each other of being history's worst.

There was no live audience and their microphones were muted as the other spoke \u2013 rules agreed to as they opened a campaign in a deeply polarized country.\n\nBiden, who was reported to have a cold, hit Trump with clearly rehearsed lines as he sought to remind millions of television viewers that Trump would be the first convicted felon in the White House. \"Think of all the civil penalties you have. How many billions of dollars do you owe in civil penalties for, for molesting a woman in public,\" Biden said, and \"for having sex with a porn star on the night, while your wife was pregnant?\" \"You have the morals of an alley cat,\" Biden said.\n\nTrump spoke loudly as he rushed through a long list of complaints about Biden's record. \"It's a shame what's happened to our country in the last four years,\" Trump said \"I'm friends with a lot of people. They cannot believe what happened to the United States of America. We're no longer respected.\" Trump sought to seize on Biden's delivery, saying at one point, \"I really don't know what he said at the end of that sentence. I don't think he knows what he said either.\"\n\nKate Bedingfield, a former Biden communications director, acknowledged that \"it was a really disappointing debate performance\" from the president. \"I don't think there is any other way to slice it,\" she told CNN after the debate.\n\nAttack on economic record\n\nBiden immediately attacked Trump when he was asked about stubborn inflation, saying that he inherited an economy in \"freefall.\" Trump said that he led \"the greatest economy in the history of our country.\" \"We have never done so well. Everybody was amazed by other countries were copying us,\" he said. Biden shot back: \"Well, look, the greatest economy in the world? He's the only one who thinks that.\"\n\nIn one of the most personal attacks, Biden cited accounts that Trump had described soldiers who died in the Normandy landing as \"suckers\" and noted his own son Beau, who served in Iraq and later died of cancer. \"My son was not a loser, was not a sucker. You're the sucker. You're the loser,\" Biden said. Trump denied the remarks and repeatedly accused Biden of not being coherent.\n\nClash on world role\n\nOn the world stage, Trump accused Biden \u2013 who faces a backlash from parts of his Democratic base over his support for Israel \u2013 of not helping Israel \"finish the job\" against Hamas. \"He doesn't want to do it. He's become like a Palestinian \u2013 but they don't like him because he's a very bad Palestinian, he's a weak one,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump described Biden's withdrawal from Afghanistan as the \"most embarrassing moment in the history of our country\" and said it encouraged Russia to invade Ukraine. Biden, however, noted that he was the first recent president who has not had soldiers at risk overseas.\n\nTrump and Biden also locked horns over abortion and immigration, key issues for their respective bases.\n\nRead more Subscribers only US Supreme Court weighs Idaho's near-total abortion ban\n\nBiden, attacking Trump for appointing justices to the Supreme Court who ended Roe vs. Wade, the decision that allowed abortion rights around the country, said: \"It's been a terrible thing, what you've done.\"",

Edited with support from Diana Roy.\n\nSubscribe to the Daily News Brief to receive it every weekday morning.\n\nTop of the Agenda\n\nSharp Foreign Policy Contrasts in First Biden-Trump Debate\n\nMore on: Daily News Brief\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump laid out their contrasting views on foreign policy in last night\u2019s first presidential debate, with Biden emphasizing the importance of global alliances and Trump arguing Washington should take more unilateral actions on matters such as trade. Trump claimed he could \u201csettle\u201d the war in Ukraine by January 2025 without making it clear how, and accused Biden of escalating the conflict, as Biden warned against Trump\u2019s bashing of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Trump asserted his goals to draw down military engagement abroad; Biden played up the importance of global alliances, but in doing so, erroneously claimed his presidency was the only one this decade without any troop deaths overseas. Trump described immigration as uncontrolled and made repeated sweeping claims about migrants\u2019 role in committing crime, while Biden defended steps taken both at the southern U.S. border and in the U.S. asylum system. Meanwhile, Trump said his proposed new tariffs would not increase prices for consumers, which economists dispute.\n\nThe event was the earliest presidential debate in U.S. history, pitting against each other the two oldest main party candidates ever to compete for the presidency. Trump also reiterated false claims of fraud in the 2020 presidential election and suggested he was not responsible for the January 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. He did not unequivocally commit to accepting this year\u2019s election result, saying he would accept the outcome if it was \u201cfair\u201d and \u201clegal.\u201d The debate was closely watched by U.S. allies for signals of potential political changes. (CNN, Foreign Policy, AP, NYT, Reuters)\n\nANALYSIS \"Trump and Biden are further apart on their approach to Washington's international relations than most presidential candidates in recent history have been, with Biden seeking to restore America's global standing and relationship with traditional allies while Trump espouses a far more isolationist doctrine,\" Foreign Policy's Rishi Iyengar and Christina Lu write. \"The spectacle was alarming at a time when the next U.S. president's foreign policy choices matter more than ever. With two wars raging in Ukraine and Gaza, a rivalry with China that risks Europe's economic autonomy and is dividing the world, and a climate crisis that demands US leadership, the stakes are especially high,\" Chatham House's Leslie Vinjamuri writes.\n\nThis CFR election tracker compares the two presidential candidates on major foreign policy issues.\n\nMore on: Daily News Brief\n\nThis issue of Foreign Affairs explores the future of global policy at stake in November\u2019s election.\n\nDaily News Brief A summary of global news developments with CFR analysis delivered to your inbox each morning.

None of them are expected to secure an outright majority; Iranian conservatives have voiced concern that the three hard-line candidates running could split the conservative vote and yield a runoff against the one reformist candidate. A runoff, if triggered, would be held on July 5.

(FT)\n\nPacific Rim\n\nChina\u2019s Ruling Party Expels Two Former Defense Ministers for Graft\n\nIn a first, Beijing announced corruption investigations yesterday into Wei Fenghe and Li Shangfu. Both men\u2019s disappearance from public life in the past year had yielded speculation that they could be facing disciplinary action.

They considered a proposal for a force of 5,000 troops that would cost up to $2.6 billion annually, and another making up 1,500 troops totaling $481 million annually. West Africa has been rife with political rifts and coups since 2020, when several governments failed to stop insurgencies, which have led to junta-ruled countries withdrawing from regional cooperation.

(FT, EU)\n\nFrance: Paris will hold snap parliamentary elections on Sunday after President Emmanuel Macron called the surprise vote following EU elections earlier this month. The far-right National Rally party is leading the polls ahead of the contest, followed by a left-leaning alliance, and Macron\u2019s centrists in third.

Far-right media personality Stew Peters said on his Telegram channel that \u201cour judicial system has been weaponized against the American people. We are left with NO option but to take matters into our own hands.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, our assessments suggest that elements on the far left in this country are also escalating militant threats. A call to \u201cFuck the Fourth\u201d recently appeared on an anarchist website, heralding a day of action on July 4 targeting the ports of Seattle, Oakland, Los Angeles, Boston, New York, New Jersey, and Baltimore. Additional summons to \u201cFlood The Gates: Escalate\u201d over the Gaza War both on college campuses and in communities across the nation this summer and fall are circulating on social media. At a pro-Palestine protest at the White House in June, one protester held up a decapitated likeness of President Joe Biden\u2019s head, while crowds chanted \u201cRevolution.\u201d\n\nThese would-be violent extremists represent a microcosm of a U.S. political landscape that is increasingly willing to tolerate violence. A survey conducted last year found that 23 percent of Americans agreed with the statement that \u201cbecause things have gotten so far off track, true American patriots may have to resort to violence in order to save our country.\u201d Another more recent poll similarly found that 28 percent of Republicans strongly agree or agree that \u201cAmericans may have to resort to violence in order to get the country back on track.\u201d Meanwhile, 12 percent of Democrats agreed with the premise.\n\nAmong gun owners in the United States, these sentiments are even more prevalent. According to a survey conducted by the University of California, Davis, \u201cAbout 42% of owners of assault-type rifles said political violence could be justified, rising to 44% of recent gun purchasers, and a staggering 56% of those who always or nearly always carry loaded guns in public\n\nAs the United States approaches its November election, the risks of violence will thus rise. This should not be surprising. Historically, violence is actually quite common in the United States, especially during election seasons. During the Reconstruction era, much of white supremacist violence directed against freed Black men and women was intended to intimidate would-be voters, ensuring that segregationist Democrats maintained their grip on power in the Deep South.\n\nMore recently, the 2022 midterms saw an assassination attempt target the speaker of the House of Representatives in an attack that seriously wounded her husband. The 2020 election, of course, sparked the Jan. 6, 2021, terrorist attack on the U.S. Capitol. In the 10 days leading up to the 2018 midterms, there were no fewer than four far-right terrorist attacks, most notably the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S. history at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. The mail bombs that circulated that same week showed that threats to politicians have in fact been particularly frequent during the Trump era.\n\nDespite that disquieting pattern, 2024 appears to provide even more fertile ground for militant responses to electoral developments. Trump\u2019s court cases, coupled with the insistence from both parties that\u2014in Trump\u2019s words\u2014\u201cIf we don\u2019t win this election, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to have another election in this country,\u201d have painted the election in existential terms.\n\nAs the United Nations Development Program concluded from its research into election violence around the world, \u201cA common cause of election violence is that the stakes of winning and losing valued political posts are in many situations \u2026 incredibly high.\u201d\n\nRendering the threat yet more severe is the range of possible locations and individuals that extremists may target, spanning the duration of election season. But how might violence differ at various stages of the campaign? Before the election, extremists may be more likely to target politicians on the campaign trail, seeking to intimidate them into changing their policies or deter them from running in the first place. Presidential candidate Nikki Haley had, for instance, requested Secret Service protection during her Republican Party primary challenge, while prominent Republican Rep. Mike Gallagher hinted that he was forced into retirement by threats against his family.\n\nBased on experience, the election itself will likely feature armed intimidation at polling places and threats levied against election officials. A database analyzed by scholars Pete Simi, Gina Ligon, Seamus Hughes, and Natalie Standridge found that threats against public officials are likely to hit an all-time high in 2024. The data initially jumped in 2017, the year of Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nIn the weeks after the forthcoming election, depending on the results, extremists will likely direct their animus toward representatives of the government\u2014especially on one of the many ceremonial dates accompanying the transition of power\u2014such the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, for instance. An exact repeat of that attack is probably less likely; law enforcement agencies will be far better prepared this time, and the groups that led the assault on the Capitol have been effectively dismantled by seditious conspiracy charges targeting their leadership.\n\nAlthough white supremacist and anti-government extremists will be the likeliest to lash out, in line with trends over the past decade, violence from the far left cannot be discounted. Stabbing attacks have repeatedly targeted right-wing political leaders in Germany, for instance, and the harassment and violence targeting American Jews on U.S. college campuses have highlighted a more militant political left that has historically been quite open to violent action, including in the United States. This violent fringe has frequently deployed armed threats against politicians in particular\u2014never more seriously than the lone gunman who targeted the Republican team practice for the congressional baseball game in 2017, or the far-left extremist from California who brought weapons to the home of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh to threaten him in 2022.\n\nSalafi jihadi actors are also emboldened by recent successes in Afghanistan, Iran, and Moscow, and they may seek to take advantage of this particularly divided moment in the United States to elbow themselves back into the national consciousness. FBI Director Christopher Wray has suggested that his organization is growing increasingly concerned about the \u201cpotential for a coordinated attack here in the homeland, not unlike the ISIS-K attack we saw at the Russian concert hall back in March.\u201d The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has similarly warned that \u201cthreat actors\u201d will likely \u201cconverge on 2024 election season,\u201d with foreign adversaries using influence operations to further divide the U.S. populace and create new sources of divisiveness and violence.\n\nIs the violence likely to lead to civil war? Trump and many of his allies have repeatedly warned that another election loss\u2014coupled with forthcoming trial verdicts\u2014would trigger one or lead to revolution in the United States. A post on Truth Social shared by Trump, for instance, suggested that 2024 might resemble 1776, \u201cexcept this time the fight is not against the British, it\u2019s against communist Americans.\u201d The threat doubled down on Trump\u2019s previous warning that his defeat would spark a \u201cbloodbath\u201d in this country.\n\nPunditry, however, is not prophecy. Despite the warnings from scholars, policy wonks, journalists, and others, civil war is in fact unlikely in this country. Geographic distinctions between would-be warring factions today run urban-rural rather than north-south, robbing any potential seditious movement of the geographical safe haven it would need to engage in nationwide conflict. But political rhetoric and the proliferation of threats is almost certain to lead to some level of violence.\n\nMaking the threat even more serious is that the Biden administration carries little-to-no legitimacy among most hardcore Trump supporters\u2014who still persist in believing that the 2020 election was stolen. The vice grip that these conspiracy theories hold on many mainstream Republicans means that any response by the Biden administration will be regarded as illegitimate\u2014whether that response is deploying additional law enforcement or even the National Guard to polling places or seeking to educate the public about the veracity and integrity of U.S. elections.\n\nIn other words, the United States finds itself in a security dilemma, where any defensive measures designed to safeguard the electoral process will in fact likely be interpreted as an offensive strike\u2014that is, to ensure a repeat electoral fraud. As the aforementioned White House protests have demonstrated, Biden also has little legitimacy in the eyes of the far left, meaning that particular movement would not likely be sated by a Democratic election victory.\n\nCountermeasures will need to focus on education and law enforcement preparation. In particular, the Biden administration should champion education tools that reassure the U.S. public about the resilience of its electoral system from hacking or cheating while also pioneering digital literacy measures that might help protect Americans from disinformation and conspiracy theories shared online, including through artificial intelligence.\n\nIn particularly high-risk areas, which might include swing states, the administration should also consider raising the law enforcement presence to deter violent actors from targeting such locations. Successfully stopping violence, however, will require a bipartisan commitment to accept election results and publicly praise the integrity of the election and its many officials\u2014which seems completely unrealistic at this stage.\n\nAmericans are therefore left with a political landscape defined by existential rhetoric and violent threats, with very little that the government can do to effectively counter these charges. Accordingly, the threat may be less of another civil war than of the total breakdown of the democratic electoral process that has defined the country since its creation.",

U.S. President Joe Biden and his Republican rival, Donald Trump, squared off on Thursday.\n\nThe first general election debate of the 2024 season has come to a close. U.S. President Joe Biden and his Republican rival, Donald Trump, squared off on Thursday.\n\nThe first general election debate of the 2024 season has come to a close. U.S. President Joe Biden and his Republican rival, Donald Trump, squared off on Thursday.\n\nThe first general election debate of the 2024 season has come to a close. U.S. President Joe Biden and his Republican rival, Donald Trump, squared off on Thursday.\n\nThe first general election debate of the 2024 season has kicked off. U.S. President Joe Biden and his Republican rival, Donald Trump, are squaring off as the candidates attempt to lure currently undecided voters.\n\nBoth candidates will talk up their own records in office and their plans for the next term, and both candidates are likely to try to spin their records and their plans in the best possible light.\n\nABC News is fact-checking both Biden and Trump's claims in real time.\n\nTrump indictments\n\nTRUMP CLAIM: \"That was a case that was started and move they moved a high-ranking official, a DOJ, into the Manhattan DA's office to start that case ... [ Biden ] basically went after his political opponent because he thought it was going to damage me.\"\n\nFACT CHECK: A few things to unpack here - but there is no evidence to support either statement.\n\nFirst and foremost, there is no evidence that Joe Biden, as president of the United States, directed or choreographed a state prosecution - which was brought by the Manhattan District Attorney, Alvin Bragg. Biden has no authority to do so and there is no evidence to support Trump's assertion.\n\nSecond, with regard to the \"high-ranking\" DOJ official who Trump claims was moved into the District Attorney's office to \"start the case\": Trump appears to be referring to Matthew Colangelo, who left the Justice Department in December of 2022 -- years after the investigation began. There is no evidence that Biden or the Justice Department coordinated Colangelo's move. The case was brought by Bragg, an elected Democrat in New York.\n\nAnd, of course, Trump was found guilty by 12 New Yorkers.\n\nThe Economy\n\nTRUMP CLAIM: \"I gave you the largest tax cut in history. I also gave you the largest regulation cut in history, that's why we had all the jobs.\"\n\nFACT-CHECK: False. According to Erica York at the Tax Foundation the Trump tax cuts (TCJA) was a large tax cut but not the largest in history. If you look at percent of revenue as share of GDP in the first two years, several tax cuts going back to 1940 were larger. The most recent that was larger was American for Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.\n\nSeparately the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that the tax cuts under President Ronald Reagan were the largest tax cuts in recent history as a percent of GDP.\n\nAt the time the law went into effect the Tax Foundation estimated that it would boost long-term employment by more than 300,000 jobs. But Moody's Chief Economist Mark Zandi says, \"the tax cuts did support job growth, but at the cost of adding approximately $2 trillion to the nation's debt. He adds, \"the regulatory changes had no measurable impact on job growth.\"\n\nTRUMP CLAIM: \"He also said he inherited 9% inflation -- no. He inherited almost no inflation and it stayed.. stayed that way for 14 months and it blew up under his leadership because they spent money like a bunch of people who didn't know what they were...\"\n\nFACT CHECK: This is mostly true. In January 2021, when Biden was inaugurated, year-over-year inflation was about 1.4%. Under Biden, year-over-year inflation peaked at 9.1 percent in June 2022. But it is now down to 3.3 percent. Under Trump, inflation rose by 7.76 percent from January 2017 to January 2021, and year-over-year inflation peaked at 2.9 percent in July 2018.\n\nTRUMP CLAIM: \" [ Biden ] created mandates. That was a disaster for our country but other than that we had - we had given back a - a country where the stock market actually was higher than pre-covid and nobody thought that was even possible.\n\nFACT CHECK: Unclear. The Dow hit 30,000 for the first time on November 24th, 2020. But that was after the last presidential election-so it's hard to say whether it was because of Trump's presidency or because of Biden's win.\n\nTRUMP CLAIM: We had the greatest economy in history.\"\n\nFACT CHECK: That's not accurate. First of all, the pandemic triggered a massive recession during his presidency. The government borrowed $3.1 trillion in 2020 to stabilize the economy. Trump had the ignominy of leaving the White House with fewer jobs than when he entered.\n\nBut even if you take out issues caused by the pandemic, economic growth averaged 2.67% during Trump's first three years. That's pretty solid. But it's nowhere near the 4% averaged during Bill Clinton's two terms from 1993 to 2001, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. In fact, growth has been stronger so far under Biden than under Trump.\n\nTrump did have the unemployment rate get as low as 3.5% before the pandemic. But again, the labor force participation rate for people 25 to 54 - the core of the U.S. working population - was higher under Clinton. The participation rate has also been higher under Biden than Trump.\n\nTrump also likes to talk about how low inflation was under him. Gasoline fell as low as $1.77 a gallon. But, of course, that price dip happened during pandemic lockdowns when few people were driving. The low prices were due to a global health crisis, not Trump's policies.\n\nSimilarly, average 30-year mortgage rates dipped to 2.65% during the pandemic. Those low rates were a byproduct of Federal Reserve efforts to prop up a weak economy, rather than the sign of strength that Trump now suggests it was.\n\nTRUMP'S CLAIM: Trump, complaining about the European Union's trade practices, claimed that the EU doesn't accept US products, including American cars. \"They don't want anything that we have,\" Trump said Thursday. \"But we're supposed to take their cars, their food, their everything, their agriculture.\"\n\nFACT CHECK: It's not true that the European Union won't take American products, including American cars, though some US exports do face EU trade barriers and though US automakers have often had a hard time gaining popularity with European consumers.\n\nThe US exported about $368 billion in goods to the European Union in 2023 (while importing about $576 billion from the EU that year), federal figures show. According to a December 2023 report from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, the EU is the second-largest market for US vehicle exports - importing 271,476 US vehicles in 2022, valued at nearly 9 billion euro. (Some of these are vehicles made by European automakers at plants in the US.) The EU's Eurostat statistical office says that car imports from the US hit a new peak in 2020, Trump's last full year in office, at a value of about 11 billion euro.\n\nAbortion\n\nTRUMP CLAIM: \"The problem they have is they're radical because they will take the life of a child in the eighth month, the ninth month, and even after birth, after birth.\"\n\nFACT CHECK: Trump inaccurately referred to abortions after birth. Infanticide is criminalized in every state, and no state has passed a law that allows killing a baby after birth.\n\nAbortion rights advocates say terms like this and \"late-term abortions\" attempt to stigmatize abortions later in pregnancy. Abortions later in pregnancy are exceedingly rare. In 2020, less than 1% of abortions in the United States were performed at or after 21 weeks, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAbortions later in pregnancy also are usually the result of serious complications, such as fetal anomalies, that put the life of the woman or fetus at risk, medical experts say. In most cases, these are also wanted pregnancies, experts say.\n\nTRUMP'S CLAIM: Former President Donald Trump repeated his frequent claim that \"everybody\" wanted Roe v. Wade overturned and the power to set abortion policy returned to individual states.\n\nFACT CHECK: Trump's claim is false. Poll after poll has shown that most Americans - two-thirds or nearly two-thirds of respondents in multiple polls - wish Roe would have been preserved.\n\nFor example, a CNN poll conducted by SSRS in April 2024 found 65% of adults opposed the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe. That's nearly identical to the result of a CNN poll conducted by SSRS in July 2022, the month after the decision. Similarly, a Marquette Law School poll in February 2024 found 67% of adults opposed the decision that overturned Roe.\n\nA NBC News poll in June 2023 found 61% opposition among registered voters to the decision that overturned Roe. A Gallup poll in May 2023 found 61% of adults called the decision a bad thing.\n\nMany legal scholars had also wanted Roe preserved, as several of them told CNN when Trump made a similar claim and said, \"all legal scholars, both sides, wanted and, in fact, demanded be ended: Roe v. Wade\" in April.\n\n\"Any claim that all legal scholars wanted Roe overturned is mind-numbingly false,\" Rutgers Law School professor Kimberly Mutcherson, a legal scholar who supported the preservation of Roe, said in April.\n\n\"Donald Trump's claim is flatly incorrect,\" another legal scholar who did not want Roe overturned, Maya Manian, an American University law professor and faculty director of the university's Health Law and Policy Program, said in April.\n\nTrump's claim is \"obviously not\" true, said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis, who is an expert on the history of the US abortion debate. Ziegler, who also did not want Roe overturned, said in an April interview: \"Most legal scholars probably track most Americans, who didn't want to overturn Roe. ... It wasn't as if legal scholars were somehow outliers.\"\n\nIt is true that some legal scholars who support abortion rights wished that Roe had been written differently; the late liberal Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was one of them. But Ziegler noted that although \"there was a cottage industry of legal scholars kind of rewriting Roe - 'what Roe should've said' - that isn't saying Roe should've been overturned. Those are very different things.\"\n\nYou can read more here.\n\nImmigration\n\nTRUMP CLAIM: \"We have the largest number of terrorists coming into our country right now.\"\n\nFACT CHECK: Largely exaggerated. Trump appears to be referring to the increasing number of migrants on the federal terror \"watchlist\" who are encountered at the border. The number of people encountered by border authorities on the watchlist jumped from three in Trump's last full year to nearly 100 in the first full fiscal year under Biden. However, the Terrorist Screening Dataset, maintained by the FBI, includes names of people who have suspected ties to individuals who may be affiliated with a foreign terror organization. It is not a comprehensive list of actual terrorists.\n\nTRUMP CLAIM: We have a border that's the most dangerous place anywhere in the world, considered the most dangerous place anywhere in the world, and he opened it up, and these killers are coming into our country, and they are raping and killing women.\n\nFACT CHECK: False. The reality is that there is no evidence that points to a major surge in crime caused by recent arrivals. Trump's claims ignore the fact that overall, crime is down across the country. According to the latest FBI statistics, which are released quarterly, overall both murder and rape rates are down 26% Quarter 1 2024 (through March 2024) compared to the same time frame last year. There is also no evidence to show that any significant number of migrants are coming from mental institutions or prisons.\n\nA mass influx of migrants coming into the U.S. illegally across the southern border has led to a number of false and misleading claims by Trump. For example, he regularly claims other countries are emptying their prisons and mental institutions to send to the U.S. There is no evidence to support that.\n\nTrump has also argued the influx of immigrants is causing a crime surge in the U.S., although statistics actually show violent crime is on the way down.\n\nThere have been recent high-profile and heinous crimes allegedly committed by people in the country illegally. But FBI statistics do not separate out crimes by the immigration status of the assailant, nor is there any evidence of a spike in crime perpetrated by migrants, either along the U.S.-Mexico border or in cities seeing the greatest influx of migrants, like New York. Studies have found that people living in the country illegally are less likely than native-born Americans to have been arrested for violent, drug and property crimes. For more than a century, critics of immigration have sought to link new arrivals to crime. In 1931, the Wickersham Commission did not find any evidence supporting a connection between immigration and increased crime, and many studies since then have reached similar conclusions.\n\nTexas is the only state that tracks crimes by immigration status. A 2020 study published by the National Academy of Sciences found \"considerably lower felony arrest rates\" among people in the United States illegally than legal immigrants or native-born.\n\nSome crime is expected given the large population of immigrants. There were an estimated 10.5 million people in the country illegally in 2021, according to the latest estimate by Pew Research Center, a figure that has almost certainly risen with large influxes at the border. In 2022, the Census Bureau estimated the foreign-born population at 46.2 million, or nearly 14% of the total, with most states seeing double-digit percentage increases in the last dozen years.\n\nBIDEN'S CLAIM: President Joe Biden said the Border Patrol union endorsed him, and then appeared to clarify and said the group \"endorsed (his) position.\"\n\nFACT CHECK: This is misleading. The National Border Patrol Council, the union that represents Border Patrol agents, backed a bipartisan border deal reached by senators that included some of the toughest security measures in recent memory, but didn't endorse Biden. The deal failed in the Senate.\n\nIn a post on X, the union swiftly responded to the president Thursday: \"To be clear, we never have and never will endorse Biden.\"\n\nEnvironment\n\nTRUMP CLAIM: \"The Paris Accord was going to cost us a trillion dollars and China nothing and Russia nothing, and India nothing. It was a rip off of the United States and I ended it because I didn't want to waste that money because they treated us horribly.\"\n\nFACT CHECK: Not entirely true. On his first day in office, Biden rejoined the Paris Climate Accord, according to a State Department memo. 196 countries signed on to the Paris Accord agreeing to work together to limit the impacts of climate change and global warming. As part of that the more developed, wealthier nations, committed to contributing $100 billion to support developing countries who are more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.\n\nBiden pledged to work with Congress to authorize $11 billion to contribute to the Paris Agreement's $100 billion funds to support developing countries who need help to adapt to the impacts of climate change. As of 2023 the U.S. was on track to meet that goal with $9.5 billion committed to financing global climate initiatives, according to the State Department.\n\nForeign Policy\n\nTRUMP CLAIM: \"Iran was broke with me. I wouldn't let anybody do business with them. They ran out of money. They were broke. They had no money for Hamas. They had no money for anything, no money for terror.\"\n\nFACT CHECK: Iran has been Hamas' principal backer for decades, including through the Trump presidency. Although Trump did withdraw from an Obama-era nuclear deal and levy sanctions against Tehran that dealt a sharp blow to its economy, records retrieved from inside Gaza by the Israeli Defense Forces and verified by independent news outlets indicate Iran still funneled tens of millions of dollars to Hamas during his administration. Two of Trump's top advisers for Middle Eastern affairs also claimed that Iran was supplying Hamas and other Palestinian terror groups with $100 million each year in an op-ed published in 2019.\n\nBIDEN CLAIM: \"The truth is I'm the only president this century that doesn't have any -- this decade -- the best to have any troops dying anywhere in the world that he did.\"\n\nFACT CHECK: According to the Washington Post's analysis of U.S. military records, at least 65 U.S. military personnel died during the Trump presidency in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, and Yemen.\n\nWith the U.S. military withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 and the end of direct military operations against ISIS in Iraq and Syria there has been a reduction in the number of U.S. military deaths. However, they are still at risk as evidenced by the 12 Marines and a Sailor who were killed during the suicide bomb attack at the airport in Kabul in August, 2021 during the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan carried out by the Biden administration. Three U.S. soldiers were killed and 47 were injured during the Jan. 29, 2024 drone attack on a U.S. base in northern Jordan carried out by Iranian-backed militia groups. Those groups had carried out more than 168 attacks on U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria supposedly in support of Hamas in its war with Israel.\n\nTRUMP CLAIM: \"We got...a lot of credit for the military, and no wars and so many other things. Everything was rocking good.\"\n\nFACT CHECK: Needs context. While it's true that Trump did not formally declare war against a foreign power while in the White House, he significantly scaled up military action in Syria and Iraq in the fight against ISIS and also authorized the air strike that killed Iranian General Qasem Soleimani-putting the country on the brink of a direct conflict with Iran. Pentagon records also show that at least 65 American troops were killed in action during Trump's term.\n\nTRUMP'S CLAIM: Trump denied that he had used the words \"suckers\" or \"losers\" to describe members of the US military who had been killed in action, after Biden pointed to the remarks to criticize his predecessor's record for veterans.\n\nBiden touted his visit to a World War I cemetery, where he said Trump \"refused to go\" and told a four-star general it's because \"they're a bunch of losers and suckers.\"\n\nTrump claimed the remark was \"made up\" by Biden.\n\nFACT CHECK: The Atlantic magazine, citing four unnamed sources with \"firsthand knowledge,\" reported in 2020 that on the day Trump canceled a visit to a military cemetery in France where US troops who were killed in World War I are buried, he had told members of his senior staff, \"Why should I go to that cemetery? It's filled with losers.\" The magazine also reported that in another conversation on the same trip, Trump had referred to marines who had been killed in the region as \"suckers.\"\n\nJohn Kelly, who served as Trump's White House chief of staff and secretary of Homeland Security, has said on the record that in 2018 Trump did use the words \"suckers\" and \"losers\" to refer to servicemembers who were killed in action. Kelly told CNN anchor Jim Sciutto for Sciutto's 2024 book that Trump would say: \"Why do you people all say that these guys who get wounded or killed are heroes? They're suckers for going in the first place, and they're losers.\"\n\nThere is no public recording of Trump making such remarks, so we can't definitively call Trump's denial false. But the account of Trump's comments does not solely rest on unnamed sources from the article in The Atlantic.\n\nBIDEN CLAIM: President Joe Biden claimed that he is the only president this decade \"that doesn't have any ... troops dying anywhere in the world, like he did,\" referring to former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"Truth is, I'm the only president this century, that doesn't have any, this decade, that doesn't have any troops dying anywhere in the world, like he did,\" Biden said.\n\nFACT CHECK: Biden is wrong. US service members have died abroad during his presidency, including 13 troops killed in a suicide bombing during the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\nThirteen US service members - including 11 Marines, one Army special operations soldier, and one Navy corpsman - were killed in the suicide bombing at the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul. Three US soldiers were also killed this year at a small US outpost in Jordan in a one-way drone attack launched by Iran-backed militants. And two US Navy SEALs died in January off the coast of Somalia while conducting a night-time seizure of lethal aid being transported from Iran to Yemen.\n\nOther US service members have also died abroad in training incidents, including five US soldiers who died in a helicopter crash in the eastern Mediterranean Sea in November 2023 during a routine refueling mission, and eight US airmen who died in a CV-22 Osprey crash in November 2023 off the coast of Yakushima Island, Japan.\n\nJanuary 6 insurrection\n\nTRUMP CLAIM: \"I offered her [ House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ] 10,000 soldiers who are National Guard. And she turned them down and the mayor of - in writing, by the way, the mayor, in writing, turned it down. The mayor of DC. They turned it down. I offered 10,000 because I could see, I had virtually nothing to do. They asked me to go make a speech.\"\n\nFACT-CHECK: FALSE\n\nThe final report by the bipartisan Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol determined there was \"no evidence\" to support the claim that Trump gave an order \"to have 10,000 troops ready for January 6th.\"\n\nThe report quoted President Trump's Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller who directly refuted this claim under oath, saying \"there was no direct order from the President\" to put 10,000 troops to be on the ready for January 6th.\n\nInstead the report noted that when Trump referenced that number of troops it was not to protect the Capitol but that he had \"floated the idea of having 10,000 National Guardsmen deployed to protect him and his supporters from any supposed threats by left-wing counter-protesters.\"\n\nCOVID-19\n\nBIDEN CLAIM: Trump told Americans to \"inject bleach\" into their arms to treat COVID-19.\n\nFACT CHECK: That's overstating it. Rather, Trump asked whether it would be possible to inject disinfectant into the lungs.\n\n\"And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in one minute,\" he said at an April 2020 press conference. \"And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning, because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it'd be interesting to check that, so that you're going to have to use medical doctors with, but it sounds interesting to me. So, we'll see, but the whole concept of the light, the way it kills it in one minute. That's pretty powerful.\"\n\nHunter Biden's laptop\n\nTRUMP CLAIM: \"It's the same thing -- 51 intelligence agents said that the laptop was Russian disinformation. It wasn't that - it came from his son, Hunter. it wasn't Russia\"\n\nFACT CHECK: At the final presidential debate of the 2020 cycle, Joe Biden suggested the contents of his son's laptop's hard-drive - which by then had been dubbed the \"laptop from hell\" in the New York Post and other conservative outlets - were \"garbage\" and a \"Russian plant.\"\n\nBiden's claim that the laptop hard-drive was a \"Russian plant\" was an apparent reference to a letter signed by 51 retired intelligence officials who wrote that the timing of its emergence \"has all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.\"\n\nSeveral of those signees have since said that Biden mischaracterized the language in their letter.\n\nFurthermore, earlier this month, prosecutors at Hunter Biden's criminal trial in Delaware introduced the laptop into evidence -- and in one of the more theatrical moments of the trial showed jurors the physical MacBook Pro 13 that Hunter Biden purportedly abandoned at a Wilmington computer repair shop in April 2019.\n\n\"Ultimately, in examining that laptop, were investigators able to confirm that it was Hunter Biden's laptop?\" prosecutor Derek Hines asked an FBI agent who testified as an expert witness.\n\nGeorge Floyd protests\n\nTRUMP'S CLAIM: Trump said that he deployed the National Guard to Minneapolis in 2020 during the unrest that followed the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer.\n\n\"When they ripped down Portland, when they ripped down many other cities. You go to Minnesota, Minneapolis, what they've done there with the fires all over the city - if I didn't bring in the National Guard, that city would have been destroyed.\"\n\nFACT CHECK: This is false. Minnesota Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, deployed the Minnesota National Guard during the 2020 unrest; Walz first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself. Walz's office told CNN in 2020 that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul - cities also run by Democrats.\n\nThe Associated Press and ABC OTV stations contributed to this report",

        "text": "Who won the Biden-Trump debate? Biden's freeze draws age concerns\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Presidential debates are always about expectations. And Thursday\u2019s verbal sparring match between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump was no exception.\n\nThe stakes were highest for Biden who, at age 81, was already battling perceptions he is too elderly for a second term. Meanwhile, Trump, 78, was facing concerns from moderate and swing voters about his at times bombastic style.\n\nThe biggest moment of the night came early, when Biden froze for several seconds while answering a question about the economy.\n\nThat \u2013 and all of the many other gaffes of the evening \u2212 will be replayed on cable news shows and shared thousands of times on social media for weeks to come. But how will it influence the 2024 election?\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of who came out on top and who fell short in the immediate aftermath.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nTrump showed more energy than Biden\n\nExperts USA TODAY spoke with said they saw sharp differences in the stamina of the two candidates on stage Thursday night, and they said Biden\u2019s low-energy demeanor could hurt him for months to come.\n\nIn one of the most defining moments of the debate, Biden took a prolonged pause and froze while answering a question about the economy. After stuttering, the president continued, but began talking about COVID-19 and Medicare.\n\nEven some of Biden's Democratic supporters felt his freeze on stage and his somewhat wooden performance tipped the scales in Trump's favor.\n\nTrump sought to highlight Biden\u2019s slower responses, at one point saying, \u201cI really don't know what he said at the end of this, and I don't think he knows what he said, either.\"\n\nThomas Whalen, a presidential historian and professor at Boston University, said Biden was \u201clooking his age,\u201d while Trump was \u201cmore controlled and sticking to his talking points.\u201d\n\nAaron Kall, director of Debate for the University of Michigan Debate Program, suggested Biden\u2019s pauses \u201ccould spur endless news cycles about (his) age and fitness to serve another term in office.\u201d\n\nNew debate format aimed to decrease chaos\n\nIf seeing Trump and Biden on stage together again didn\u2019t provide enough deja vu, their matchup also marked the first time since 1960 that a presidential debate was held without a live audience. The last time was when John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon clashed.\n\nThe format was designed to eliminate immediate reactions to candidates\u2019 remarks. Aaron Kall, director of debate for the University of Michigan, suggested it forced genuine responses rather than scripted statements from the candidates.\n\nRather than rely on audience energy, Trump and Biden had to \u201ctrust their guts and instincts and previous debate experiences,\u201d Kall said.\n\nThe use of muted microphones in the debate also nearly eliminated the type of candidate crosstalk that has plagued past debates, including most recently during the GOP primary.\n\nGeorgia voters are central focus\n\nTrump and Biden weren\u2019t the only ones in the spotlight Thursday night. All-important Georgia voters were, too.\n\nThe location of the debate at CNN\u2019s studios in Atlanta underscored Georgia\u2019s role as crucial swing state in the election and served as a reminder that the candidate's messages \u2212 and bickering \u2212 will echo far beyond the stage.\n\nBiden won Georgia by just under 12,000 votes in 2020. But recent polling this year has shown Trump with a slight edge over his competitor in the key battleground territory.\n\nAnd the side-by-side comparison of the two candidates Thursday could very well sway the minds of undecided voters in the state. It was one of few opportunities the public will have to hear from the two men directly and judge for themselves who is the better pick for the country.\n\nNot to mention that the location gave both candidates an opportunity to campaign around the Atlanta suburbs. Trump called in to a local barbershop on Wednesday to talk with a group his campaign called the Black American Business Leaders Barbershop Roundtable. And Biden\u2019s campaign said the president planned to attend watch parties across the city after the debate to talk with voters.\n\nAlso of significance: The debate occurred only a few miles from the jail where Trump was booked last year on charges related to claims that he conspired to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nA major money boost for Democrats and Republicans\n\nBoth major parties are expected to raise big dollars off Thursday\u2019s affair. Similarly well-watched events have brought in the green for the two candidates.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign said he raised $10 million in the 24 hours after the State of the Union address. After Trump\u2019s felony conviction in his New York hush money trial, his campaign said it raised $34.8 million in small-dollar donations.\n\nAnd both groups we\u2019re leaning into their fundraising.\n\nHours before the debate began, Biden\u2019s team sent out a message telling supporters that he was \u201ccounting on\u201d them to donate at least $30.\n\n\u201cTens of thousands of new supporters stepped up following my debates against Trump in 2020. And tonight, can\u2019t be any different,\u201d the message said.\n\nThe Democratic Party of Georgia also hosted a watch party charging $24 per advance ticket. Former Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler was similarly hosting a high-dollar event for Trump the night of the debate.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign said it had its best grassroots fundraising hours of the entire campaign leading up to the debate.\n\nFalse claims abound\n\nAshley Koning, director of the Rutgers Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling, argued that \u201cfacts and truth\u201d were the biggest losers of the night.\n\nBoth Trump and Biden made false comments throughout the debate that largely went unchecked by the moderators.\n\nTrump repeated claims that the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol was former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s fault. Trump claimed he offered Pelosi \u201c10,000 soldiers\u201d to stop the attack. Pelosi\u2019s office has said, however, that she never received such an officer and that she wouldn\u2019t have had the power to refuse either way.\n\nThe former real estate mogul also claimed the U.S. southern border is the most dangerous place in the world. There is no evidence to suggest this.\n\nBiden also made incorrect claims. At one point, he claimed he was \u201cthe only president this century ... that doesn\u2019t have any troops dying anywhere in the world.\u201d\n\nIn 2021, during Biden\u2019s presidency, 13 U.S. service members were killed in a suicide bombing attack in Afghanistan as thousands tried to flee the Taliban\u2019s takeover of the country.\n\nRFK and third-party candidates absent from the conversation\n\nNoticeably absent from the CNN stage? Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nKennedy didn\u2019t meet the qualifications for the debate, which required candidates to appear on a \u201csufficient number of state ballots to reach the 270 electoral vote thresholds to win the presidency\u201d and receive at least 15% in four qualifying national polls, according to CNN.\n\nIn a three-way matchup with Biden and Trump, Kennedy receives 10.7% of the vote, according to a Real Clear Politics average of polling.\n\nKennedy counterprogrammed the prime-time debate by answering the same questions as Biden and Trump live on a social media stream and on his website. But he remained largely out of sight for most voters on a night that centered on the two major party candidates.",

        "text": "'Very bad Palestinian': Trump slams Biden's Israel performance at presidential debate\nPresident Biden and former President Donald Trump were put in the hot seat regarding Middle East policy in Thursday night's first presidential debate of the 2024 campaign when asked respectively about leverage over Hamas and Israel to end the war and support for a Palestinian state.\n\nBiden outlined the three phases of his ceasefire proposal and said Hamas is the only one who wants the war to continue and is standing in the way of the deal.\n\n\"We're still pushing hard for them to accept,\" Biden said.\n\nHe added that Hamas has been greatly weakened and should be eliminated.\n\nIsrael remained a crucial topic for Republican and Democratic candidates alike\n\nWhile not naming Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Biden acknowledged Netanyahu's claims that he's denied Israel weapons. People watch the first Presidential debate between US President Joe Biden and Republican candidate, former President Donald Trump, from a tavern in San Diego, California, US, June 27, 2024. (credit: REUTERS)\n\n\"The only thing I've denied Israel was 2,000-pound bombs; they don't work very well in populated areas,\" he said. \"We are providing Israel with all the weapons they need and when they need them.\"\n\nBiden added that \"he's the guy that organized the world against Iran\" when they had a full-blown ballistic missile attack on Israel.\n\nBiden touted that not one Israeli was accidentally killed.\n\n\"We saved Israel. We are the biggest producer of support for Israel out of anyone in the world,\" Biden said.\n\nTrump said \"he'd have to see\" when asked if he'd support a Palestinian state. Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Subscribe Now\n\nReferencing Biden's claim that Hamas is the only one who wants war, Trump said Israel wants war.\n\n\"And he should let them go and let them finish the job,\" Trump said of Biden. \"He doesn't want to do it. He's become like a Palestinian, but they don't like him because he's a very bad Palestinian. He's a weak one.\"\n\nDuring the debate, Trump claimed that Hamas would never have invaded Israel if he were president.\n\nRegarding the Israel-Hamas war, Biden stated, \"We are the biggest supporter of Israel in the world,\" adding, \"Hamas cannot be allowed to continue.\"\n\nThere were no questions about humanitarian aid to Gaza or specific day-after plans.\n\nThere were also no questions on Lebanon or rising antisemitism in the US and around the world.\n\nThe two men also traded barbs on abortion, immigration, the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, their handling of the economy, and even their golf games as they each sought to shake up what opinion polls show has been a virtually tied race for months.\n\nBackground behind the highly anticipated debate\n\nBiden and Trump have made little effort to disguise their mutual dislike. During their first debate in 2020, Trump aggressively talked over Biden in a performance that turned off many voters.\n\nBoth men entered the debate in Atlanta with political vulnerabilities that presented a mix of risk and opportunity.\n\nThe clash also arrived at a moment of profound polarization and deep-seated anxiety among voters about the state of American politics. Two-thirds of voters said in a May Reuters/Ipsos poll that they were concerned violence could follow the election, nearly four years after a mob of Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol.\n\nTrump, 78, took the stage as a felon who still faces a trio of criminal cases, including charges related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nBiden, 81, was under intense pressure to avoid verbal stumbles and deliver a forceful debate performance after months of Republican assertions his faculties have dulled with age.\n\nAhead of the debate, each campaign was set to launch a new ad campaign attacking its rival.\n\nThe Biden campaign said it would launch a new ad blitz in the Atlanta area focused on what a second Trump presidency could look like, including threats to reproductive freedom, a ban on abortion, cuts to Social Security, and undermining democracy.\n\nCNN attempted to avoid cross-talk by muting the candidates' microphones when it was not their turn to speak. The debate also took place without an audience, and neither candidate was allowed to bring prepared notes or props, though they were allowed to have a pen and paper.\n\nBiden advisers say he emphasized Trump's role in threatening abortion access, portray him as a danger to democratic norms, and remind voters of Trump's often chaotic 2017-2021 term in office.\n\nTrump focused on Biden's stewardship of the southern US border in the face of record numbers of migrants crossing illegally as well as the economy, particularly inflation, while also questioning his world leadership at a time of war in Gaza and Ukraine, Trump advisers said.\n\nThe second and final debate in this year's campaign is scheduled for September.",

        "text": "90 disability organizations call on CNN to make the presidential debate more accessible\nAhead of the first presidential debate of the 2024 election cycle, 90 disability organizations signed onto a letter to host CNN, requesting that the debate be made more accessible and that moderators consider topics relevant to the disability community.\n\n\u201cWe hope that CNN will really listen to us when we say that adding these accessibility features to their debate coverage will lead to a more inclusive democracy and a more informed electorate,\u201d said Maria Town, president of the American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD), one of the most prominent cross-disability groups in the United States and the letter\u2019s lead author.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump will debate Thursday for the first time in nearly four years. The debate, hosted by CNN in Atlanta, will be moderated by Jake Tapper and Dana Bash. Unlike in past years, it won\u2019t be conducted in front of a live audience.\n\nThere are approximately 30 million disabled adults in the United States, and they do not appear to favor a particular party. AAPD is nonpartisan, and Town highlighted that including disabled Americans in the democratic process is not a partisan endeavor.\n\n\u201c[Disabled people] are an incredibly diverse group of voters. Disability exists in every community. So when you\u2019re talking about disabled voters, you\u2019re also talking about women voters, Black voters, you\u2019re talking about older adults, you\u2019re talking about younger people,\u201d Town said. Other signatories include the National Association of the Deaf, the National Disability Rights Network and The Arc of the United States.\n\nThe letter asks CNN to provide American Sign Language interpreters in different capacities for deaf and hard of hearing viewers and for CNN to ensure captions are added when they upload clips of the debate. No debate host has previously provided American Sign Language in any capacity, except for in person attendees.\n\nAs of publication, CNN had not responded to multiple attempts at contact by the American Association of People with Disabilities ahead of the debate, according to Town.\n\n\n\nWhen The 19th reached out for comment, a CNN representative did respond, but did not answer any questions. They said they will have closed captioning on the television broadcast \u2014 as the network routinely does. They also provided brief instructions on how to turn closed captioning on.\n\nIn 2016 and 2020, DPAN, an online-only Deaf streaming platform and American Sign Language captioning service, independently provided their own livestream of the debates with American Sign Language interpreters. DPAN\u2019s website and social media do not indicate that they will be providing the service for this election cycle, and they did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTown praised DPAN\u2019s previous debate livestreams, while expressing frustration that they had to step in at all. According to Town, the responsibility to make the debate content accessible lies with the networks hosting the debates.\n\n\u201cOnce again, disabled people themselves have to figure out how to mobilize their resources in order to meet a communication obligation that the network should be addressing itself,\u201d she said.\n\nIt is unclear what topics will be covered during the debate or if anything particularly relevant to disability communities will be asked by the moderators. The letter to CNN suggests a wide range of topics, including funding for home care and special education services, reproductive rights, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the low availability of accessible housing.\n\nA 2021 report from the federal Election Assistance Commission indicated that disabled Americans are 7 percent less likely to vote than their non-disabled peers. Lack of access to information was one reason for the gap cited in the report.\n\nMany disabled voters also lack confidence that politicians care about them or their issues. A 2023 poll from progressive firm Data for Progress found that two out of three disabled voters believe that politicians \u201cdon\u2019t care about the disabled community.\u201d Data for Progress is one of the only firms that polls disabled people as a demographic.\n\nSign up for more news and context delivered to your inbox, daily You have been subscribed!

You should try again with a different email address. If you have any questions, contact us at [email protected].\n\nInformation access is a particular issue in deaf and hard of hearing communities. Lack of language early in life, because hearing parents do not know their baby is deaf or because they do not know or use sign language, can lead to later difficulties with reading and writing. Deaf advocates and researchers call this phenomenon \u201clanguage deprivation.\u201d\n\nAnother barrier is that American Sign Language and English are not at all interchangeable \u2014 understanding one does not guarantee a person can understand the other, and for many in deaf communities, English is essentially a second language.\n\n\u201cAmerican Sign Language and English are two very different and distinct languages. ASL isn\u2019t a direct translation of English; it has its own grammar, syntax and cultural nuances. ASL interpreters can convey these subtleties better than captions, which may not capture the full meaning or emotional tone of the content,\u201d said Bobbie Beth Scoggins, interim director of the National Association of the Deaf, one of the preeminent organizations by and for Deaf Americans. They are also signatories of the letter to CNN.\n\nScoggins pointed out that live captions are often incomplete and lag significantly in conveying crucial information.\n\n\u201cWhile closed captioning is valuable and necessary for many, ASL interpreters on TV fulfill a different and equally essential role by providing direct access to information in their primary language, promoting inclusivity, and ensuring cultural and linguistic representation,\u201d Scoggins said.\n\nTown said the letter\u2019s requests reflect how the disability community has shifted in its expectations of candidates and elected officials, and that the community is committed to stronger advocacy for civic engagement and accessible voting.\n\n\u201cFor a long time, whether it\u2019s been presidential debates or town halls, if a candidate even said the word \u2018disability,\u2019 that was a big deal,\u201d Town said \u201cAs a community, we have come farther than that. We are engaged politically. We are out there. We are voting. We are a constituency that candidates need to address. We should no longer accept [candidates] just saying the word \u2018disability.\u2019\u201d\n\nSean Forbes, CEO of DPAN, responded to a request for comment after the publication of this piece. He told The 19th that DPAN will not be offering debate interpretation this year because they did not secure funding for it.\n\nIn 2016, DPAN had an angel investor who helped them fund ambitious projects at cost. Debate interpretation was \u201can astounding success,\u201d according to Forbes. They had over 500,000 viewers across different platforms and their website crashed because it got more traffic than it could handle.\n\n\u201cUltimately, the 2016 debates were funded out of our pocket in hopes of bigger support from entities like CNN, NBC, and ABC to provide this,\u201d Forbes said. That support did not manifest, he said.\n\nIn 2020, they did the debate interpretation again, partially funded by a grant, with the hopes that major networks would follow suit. Once again, that support did not manifest. DPAN did not secure funding to interpret the 2024 debates. But according to Forbes, they shouldn\u2019t have to.\n\n\u201cWe need entities like CNN, Netflix, ABC, ESPN, LiveNation, etc. to jump on board and partner with organizations like ours so we can work together to provide ASL access. We don\u2019t expect them to know what to do, how to provide it, or what the best practices are, but we want them to know they can always reach out to us and we will do our best to make sure that access happens,\u201d Forbes said.",

(AP Photo: Jim Bourg/Pool)\n\nHow can I watch it in Australia?\n\nCNN's debate will be broadcast live on the ABC News Channel from 11am AEST.\n\nJeremy Fernandez will be joined by US and political experts for special analysis after the debate.\n\nNewsRadio will be streaming the debate live from 11am AEST. Listen via the ABC Listen app.\n\nWhy are only Trump and Biden debating?\n\nCNN said only Biden and Trump met its conditions for participating in the debate.\n\nThe candidates had to appear on enough state ballots to potentially win the presidency, and receive at least 15 per cent in four separate national polls of registered or likely voters.\n\nIndependent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr did not make the cut.\n\nJake Tapper and Dana Bash will moderate the debate with \"all tools at their disposal\", CNN said. (Reuters: Mike Segar)\n\nWhat are the rules?\n\nCNN has shared some rules that the 90-minute debate, moderated by veteran CNN anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, is set to follow.\n\nThe moderators \"will use all tools at their disposal to enforce timing and ensure a civilised discussion\", CNN said. The first debate between Trump and Biden in 2020 was rife with interruptions and attacks.\n\nCandidates will be given a pen, paper and bottle of water.\n\nThey cannot use props or bring in notes.\n\nMicrophones will be muted except for the candidate whose turn it is to speak.\n\nBiden will be on the podium on the right side of viewers' screens and Trump on the left, decided with a coin toss.\n\nThe coin toss also decided that Trump will get the last word.\n\nCampaign staff may not interact with candidates during the two ad breaks.\n\nWhat is expected to come up?\n\nStrategists say there are risks for both candidates, who are locked in a tight race and share low enthusiasm from voters.\n\nJoe Biden's son is now a convicted liar. Donald Trump won't let him forget it Photo shows A court sketch shows a side profile of Hunter Biden sitting in court. Hunter Biden's status as a convicted liar could breathe some life into Republicans' efforts to bring down his father, while complicating the mileage Joe Biden can get out of Donald Trump's legal woes.\n\nBiden, 81, and Trump, 78, are the oldest candidates ever to seek the presidency and viewers will likely question their cognitive abilities and emotional steadiness.\n\nTrump aides see Biden as prone to verbal slip-ups that could amplify voter concerns about the president's age.\n\nBiden aides think debates could hurt Trump by exposing his volatility and sometimes changing positions on issues, such as abortion.\n\nBiden's campaign is hoping to talk about abortion and Trump's about immigration, but CNN's moderators will decide the questions.\n\nSome topics that are likely to feature in questions include:\n\nHow the candidates would handle challenges posed by persistently high grocery prices\n\nMigrants on the US-Mexico border\n\nThe ongoing Israel-Gaza and Russia-Ukraine wars\n\nBoth candidates have had their share of unfavourable news coverage that could come up during the debate.\n\nFor Trump, that includes his role in the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his conviction on 34 felony counts for involvement in a hush money scheme.\n\nThe same goes for the legal woes facing Biden's son, Hunter, who was convicted of lying about his drug use to illegally buy a gun.\n\nWhat happened last time?\n\nThen-president Trump and Biden debated twice during the 2020 race.\n\nA guide to Trump's court cases Photo shows Trump looks down frowning while wearing a suit in court Donald Trump has been found guilty in a hush money trial, but his legal woes are far from over. As he continues his bid to retake the White House, here\u2019s a status update on his other court cases.\n\nMore than 73 million people tuned in for the first exchange, which devolved into a chaotic shouting match.\n\nFor the second debate, moderators said they would mute each candidate's microphone to allow the other to speak without interruption for the first two minutes of each debate segment. The candidates behaved more civilly and the mute button was not a major factor.\n\nA third debate was cancelled after Trump tested positive for COVID-19 and spent three days in a hospital. He declined to participate in a virtual event.\n\nAhead of the upcoming CNN debate, Trump asked the crowd at an election rally in Philadelphia if he should be \"tough and nasty\" or \"nice and calm\" \u2014 so what the tone of conversation will be this time around remains to be seen.\n\n\"How should I handle him? Should I be tough and nasty and just say, 'You're the worst president in history?' Or should I be nice and calm and let him speak?\"\n\nHe has thrown some early blows at Biden and CNN, and accused the moderators of being biased against him.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nThe US broadcaster ABC will host a second debate on September 10, but the network has not yet shared details on where the event will be held.\n\nTraditionally, there are three presidential debates, however no third Trump-Biden match-up has been announced yet.\n\nVice-President Kamala Harris accepted a CBS News invitation for a vice-presidential debate on either July 23 or August 13, according to a campaign spokesperson.\n\nTrump hasn't named his running mate yet.\n\nABC/wires",

        "text": "New York Times urges Joe Biden to drop out of presidential race\nThe New York Times\u2019s editorial board has called on Joe Biden to drop out of the 2024 presidential race after a disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump.\n\nBiden\u2019s poor performance sent leading Democrats into a panic on Thursday night, after the US president appeared shaky and at points struggled to finish sentences. It amplified fears about his age and fitness for office that it had been hoped the debate would allay.\n\nShortly after the debate, senior Democrats including the vice-president, Kamala Harris, acknowledged Biden\u2019s \u201cslow start\u201d but emphasised his \u201cstrong finish\u201d, while others privately suggested he should step aside.\n\nIn a move that will add further pressure on the White House, the New York Times editorial board said in an opinion piece on Friday that \u201cthe greatest public service [Biden] can now perform is to announce that he will not continue to run for re-election\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe president appeared on Thursday night as the shadow of a great public servant,\u201d it said. \u201cHe struggled to explain what he would accomplish in a second term. He struggled to respond to [Trump\u2019s] provocations. He struggled to hold [Trump] accountable for his lies, his failures and his chilling plans. More than once, he struggled to make it to the end of a sentence.\u201d\n\n\u201cBiden is not the man he was four years ago,\u201d it added.\n\nEarlier in the day, the leading New York Times columnist Thomas L Friedman called on his \u201cfriend\u201d to step aside. \u201cJoe Biden, a good man and a good president, has no business running for re-election,\u201d he said.\n\nThe former US president Barack Obama defended Biden in a social media post on Friday. \u201cBad debate nights happen,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this election is still a choice between someone who has fought for ordinary folks his entire life and someone who only cares about himself.\u201d\n\nIn a campaign stop in North Carolina on Friday, Biden appeared far more energised and coherent. He acknowledged his widely panned debate performance.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t walk as easily as I used to, I don\u2019t speak as smoothly as I used to, I don\u2019t debate as well as I used to,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBut I know what I do know. I know how to tell the truth.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times has become the first nationally distributed US newspaper to call on Biden to drop out of the race, but other influential publications including the Wall Street Journal, the Financial Times and the Atlantic have published op-eds by their leading columnists calling on Biden to step aside. Journal columnist Peggy Noonan said allowing Biden to continue \u201clooks like elder abuse\u201d.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A New York Times/Sienna poll published this week before the debate found that Trump had a three-point lead over Biden. In the \u201cbattleground\u201d states that are key to winning the White House, Trump is ahead in six out of seven, according to RealClearPolling.",

        "text": "Here\u2019s a look at some of the false claims made during Biden and Trump\u2019s first debate\nPresident Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump traded barbs and a variety of false and misleading information as they faced off in their first debate of the 2024 election.\n\nTrump falsely represented the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol as a relatively small number of people who were ushered in by police and misstated the strength of the economy during his administration.\n\nThe latest on the Biden-Trump debate\n\nThe debate was a critical moment\n\n\n\nwas a Take a look at the facts\n\n\n\nat Both candidates wasted no time sparring over policy during their 90-minute faceoff. These are the takeaways\n\nBiden, who tends to lean more on exaggerations and embellishments rather than outright lies, misrepresented the cost of insulin and overstated what Trump said about using disinfectant to address COVID. Here\u2019s a look at the false and misleading claims on Thursday night by the two candidates.\n\n___\n\nJAN. 6\n\nTRUMP: \u201cThey talk about a relatively small number of people that went to the Capitol and in many cases were ushered in by the police.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: That\u2019s false. The attack on the U.S. Capitol was the deadliest assault on the seat of American power in over 200 years. As thoroughly documented by video, photographs and people who were there, thousands of people descended on Capitol Hill in what became a brutal scene of hand-to-hand combat with police.\n\nIn an internal memo on March 7, 2023, U.S. Capitol Police Chief J. Thomas Manger said that the allegation that \u201cour officers helped the rioters and acted as \u2018tour guides\u2019\u201d is \u201coutrageous and false.\u201d A Capitol Police spokesperson confirmed the memo\u2019s authenticity to The Associated Press. More than 1,400 people have been charged with federal crimes stemming from the riot. More than 850 people have pleaded guilty to crimes, and 200 others have been convicted at trial.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP, on then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s actions on Jan. 6: \u201cBecause I offered her 10,000 soldiers or National Guard and she turned them down.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: Pelosi did not direct the National Guard. Further, as the Capitol came under attack, she and then-Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell called for military assistance, including from the National Guard.\n\nThe Capitol Police Board makes the decision on whether to call National Guard troops to the Capitol. It is made up of the House Sergeant at Arms, the Senate Sergeant at Arms and the Architect of the Capitol. The board decided not to call the guard ahead of the insurrection but did eventually request assistance after the rioting had already begun, and the troops arrived several hours later.\n\nThe House Sergeant at Arms reported to Pelosi and the Senate Sergeant at Arms reported to McConnell. There is no evidence that either Pelosi or McConnell directed the security officials not to call the guard beforehand. Drew Hammill, a then-spokesperson for Pelosi, said after the insurrection that Pelosi was never informed of such a request.\n\n___\n\nTAXES AND REGULATIONS\n\nTRUMP, on Biden: \u201cHe wants to raise your taxes by four times.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: That\u2019s not accurate.\n\nTrump has used that line at rallies, but it has no basis in fact. Biden actually wants to prevent tax increases on anyone making less than $400,000, which is the vast majority of taxpayers.\n\nMore importantly, Biden\u2019s budget proposal does not increase taxes as much as Trump claims, though the increases are focused on corporations and the wealthy. Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts for individuals are set to expire after 2025, because they were not fully funded when they became law.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP, referring to Jan. 6, 2021, the day a mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol in an effort to stop the certification of Biden\u2019s victory: \u201cOn January 6th we had the lowest taxes ever. We had the lowest regulations ever on January 6th.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: The current federal income tax was only instituted in 1913, and tax rates have fluctuated significantly in the decades since. Rates were lower in the 1920s, just prior to the Great Depression. Trump did cut taxes during his time in the White House, but the rates weren\u2019t the lowest in history.\n\nGovernment regulations have also ebbed and flowed in the country\u2019s history, but there\u2019s been an overall increase in regulations as the country modernized and its population grew. There are now many more regulations covering the environment, employment, financial transactions and other aspects of daily life. While Trump slashed some regulations, he didn\u2019t take the country back to the less regulated days of its past.\n\n___\n\nINSULIN\n\nBIDEN: \u201cIt\u2019s $15 for an insulin shot, as opposed to $400.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: No, that\u2019s not exactly right. Out-of-pocket insulin costs for older Americans on Medicare were capped at $35 in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act that President Joe Biden signed into law. The cap took effect last year, when many drugmakers announced they would lower the price of the drug to $35 for most users on private insurance. But Biden regularly overstates that many people used to pay up to $400 monthly. People with diabetes who have Medicare or private insurance paid about $450 yearly prior to the law, a Department of Health and Human Services study released in December 2022 found.\n\n___\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE\n\nTRUMP, touting his environmental record, said that \u201cduring my four years, I had the best environmental numbers ever\u201d and that he supports \u201cimmaculate\u201d air and water.\n\nTHE FACTS: That\u2019s far from the whole story. During his presidency, Trump rolled back some provisions of the Clean Water Act, eased regulations on coal, oil and gas companies and pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord. When wildfires struck California in 2020, Trump dismissed the scientific consensus that climate change had played a role. Trump also dismissed scientists\u2019 warnings about climate change and routinely proposed deep cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency. Those reductions were blocked by Democratic and Republican lawmakers.\n\n___\n\nABORTION\n\nTRUMP: \u201cThe problem they have is they\u2019re radical because they will take the life of a child in the eighth month, the ninth month, and even after birth, after birth.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: Trump inaccurately referred to abortions after birth. Infanticide is criminalized in every state, and no state has passed a law that allows killing a baby after birth.\n\nAbortion rights advocates say terms like this and \u201clate-term abortions\u201d attempt to stigmatize abortions later in pregnancy. Abortions later in pregnancy are exceedingly rare. In 2020, less than 1% of abortions in the United States were performed at or after 21 weeks, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAbortions later in pregnancy also are usually the result of serious complications, such as fetal anomalies, that put the life of the woman or fetus at risk, medical experts say. In most cases, these are also wanted pregnancies, experts say.\n\n___\n\nRUSSIA\n\nTRUMP on Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who was detained in Russia: \u201cHe should have had him out a long time ago, but Putin\u2019s probably asking for billions and billions of dollars because this guy pays it every time.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: Trump is wrong to say that Biden pays any sort of fee \u201cevery time\u201d to secure the release of hostages and wrongfully detained Americans. There\u2019s also zero evidence that Putin is asking for any money in order to free Gershkovich. Just like in the Trump administration, the deals during the Biden administration that have brought home hostages and detainees involved prisoner swaps -- not money transfers.\n\nTrump\u2019s reference to money appeared to be about the 2023 deal in which the U.S. secured the release of five detained Americans in Iran after billions of dollars in frozen Iranian assets were transferred from banks in South Korea to Qatar. The U.S. has said that that the money would be held in restricted accounts and will only be able to be used for humanitarian goods, such as medicine and food.\n\n___\n\nCOVID-19\n\nBIDEN: Trump told Americans to \u201cinject bleach\u201d into their arms to treat COVID-19.\n\nTHE FACTS: That\u2019s overstating it. Rather, Trump asked whether it would be possible to inject disinfectant into the lungs.\n\n\u201cAnd then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in one minute,\u201d he said at an April 2020 press conference. \u201cAnd is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning, because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it\u2019d be interesting to check that, so that you\u2019re going to have to use medical doctors with, but it sounds interesting to me. So, we\u2019ll see, but the whole concept of the light, the way it kills it in one minute. That\u2019s pretty powerful.\u201d\n\n___\n\nSUPER PREDATORS\n\nTRUMP: \u201cWhat he\u2019s done to the Black population is horrible, including the fact that for 10 years he called them \u2018super predators.\u2019 \u2026 We can\u2019t forget that - super predators \u2026 And they\u2019ve taken great offense at it.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: This oft-repeated claim by Trump dating back to the 2020 campaign is untrue. It was Hillary Clinton, then the first lady, who used the term \u201csuper predator\u201d to advocate for the 1994 crime bill that Biden co-authored more than thirty years ago. Biden did warn of \u201cpredators\u201d in a floor speech in support of his bill.\n\n___\n\nMIGRANTS\n\nTRUMP, referring to Biden: \u201cHe\u2019s the one that killed people with a bad border and flooding hundreds of thousands of people dying and also killing our citizens when they come in.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: A mass influx of migrants coming into the U.S. illegally across the southern border has led to a number of false and misleading claims by Trump. For example, he regularly claims other countries are emptying their prisons and mental institutions to send to the U.S. There is no evidence to support that.\n\nTrump has also argued the influx of immigrants is causing a crime surge in the U.S., although statistics actually show violent crime is on the way down.\n\nThere have been recent high-profile and heinous crimes allegedly committed by people in the country illegally. But FBI statistics do not separate out crimes by the immigration status of the assailant, nor is there any evidence of a spike in crime perpetrated by migrants, either along the U.S.-Mexico border or in cities seeing the greatest influx of migrants, like New York. Studies have found that people living in the country illegally are less likely than native-born Americans to have been arrested for violent, drug and property crimes. For more than a century, critics of immigration have sought to link new arrivals to crime. In 1931, the Wickersham Commission did not find any evidence supporting a connection between immigration and increased crime, and many studies since then have reached similar conclusions.\n\nTexas is the only state that tracks crimes by immigration status. A 2020 study published by the National Academy of Sciences found \u201cconsiderably lower felony arrest rates\u201d among people in the United States illegally than legal immigrants or native-born.\n\nSome crime is expected given the large population of immigrants. There were an estimated 10.5 million people in the country illegally in 2021, according to the latest estimate by Pew Research Center, a figure that has almost certainly risen with large influxes at the border. In 2022, the Census Bureau estimated the foreign-born population at 46.2 million, or nearly 14% of the total, with most states seeing double-digit percentage increases in the last dozen years.\n\n___\n\nCHARLOTTESVILLE\n\nBIDEN, referring to Trump after the deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017: \u201cThe one who said I think they\u2019re fine people on both sides.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: Trump did use those words to describe attendees of the deadly rally, which was planned by white nationalists. But as Trump supporters have pointed out, he also said that day that he wasn\u2019t talking about the neo-Nazis and white nationalists in attendance.\n\n\u201cYou had some very bad people in that group,\u201d Trump said during a news conference a few days after the rally, \u201cBut you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides.\u201d\n\nHe then added that he wasn\u2019t talking about \u201cthe neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally.\u201d Instead, he said, the press had been unfair in its treatment of protesters who were there to innocently and legally protest the removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.\n\nThe gathering planned by white nationalists shocked the nation when it exploded into chaos: violent brawling in the streets, racist and antisemitic chants, smoke bombs, and finally, a car speeding into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing one and injuring dozens more.\n\n___\n\nECONOMY\n\nTRUMP: We had the greatest economy in history.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: That\u2019s not accurate. First of all, the pandemic triggered a massive recession during his presidency. The government borrowed $3.1 trillion in 2020 to stabilize the economy. Trump had the ignominy of leaving the White House with fewer jobs than when he entered.\n\nBut even if you take out issues caused by the pandemic, economic growth averaged 2.67% during Trump\u2019s first three years. That\u2019s pretty solid. But it\u2019s nowhere near the 4% averaged during Bill Clinton\u2019s two terms from 1993 to 2001, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. In fact, growth has been stronger so far under Biden than under Trump.\n\nTrump did have the unemployment rate get as low as 3.5% before the pandemic. But again, the labor force participation rate for people 25 to 54 \u2014 the core of the U.S. working population \u2014 was higher under Clinton. The participation rate has also been higher under Biden than Trump.\n\nTrump also likes to talk about how low inflation was under him. Gasoline fell as low as $1.77 a gallon. But, of course, that price dip happened during pandemic lockdowns when few people were driving. The low prices were due to a global health crisis, not Trump\u2019s policies.\n\nSimilarly, average 30-year mortgage rates dipped to 2.65% during the pandemic. Those low rates were a byproduct of Federal Reserve efforts to prop up a weak economy, rather than the sign of strength that Trump now suggests it was.\n\n___\n\nMILITARY DEATHS\n\nBIDEN: \u201cThe truth is, I\u2019m the only president this century that doesn\u2019t have any \u2014 this decade \u2014 any troops dying anywhere in the world like he did.\u201d\n\n\u201dTHE FACTS: At least 16 service members have been killed in hostile action since Biden took office in January 2021. On Aug. 26, 2021, 13 died during a suicide bombing at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, as U.S. troops withdrew from the country. An enemy drone killed three U.S. service members at a desert base in Jordan on Jan. 28 of this year.\n\n___\n\nPRESIDENTIAL RECORD\n\nBIDEN: \u201c159, or 58, don\u2019t know an exact number, presidential historians, they\u2019ve had meetings and they voted, who is the worst president in American history \u2026 They said he was the worst in all American history. That\u2019s a fact. That\u2019s not conjecture.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: That\u2019s almost right, but not quite. The survey in question, a project from professors at the University of Houston and Coastal Carolina University, included 154 usable responses, from 525 respondents invited to participate.\n\n___\n\nGEORGE FLOYD PROTESTS\n\nTRUMP, on Minneapolis protests after the killing of George Floyd: \u201cIf I didn\u2019t bring in the National Guard, that city would have been destroyed.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: Trump didn\u2019t call the National Guard into Minneapolis during the unrest following the death of George Floyd. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz deployed the National Guard to the city.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Josh Boak, Elliot Spagat, Eric Tucker, Ali Swenson, Christina Cassidy, Amanda Seitz, Stephen Groves, David Klepper, Melissa Goldin and Hope Yen contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFind AP Fact Checks here: https://apnews.com/APFactCheck.",

        "text": "Debate takeaways: Trump confident, even when wrong, Biden halting, even with facts on his side\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The presidential debate was a re-run that featured two candidates with a combined age of 159, but it went especially poorly for one of them, President Joe Biden.\n\nAlready fighting voter concerns about his age, Biden, 81, was halting and seemed to lose his train of thought Thursday night, sparking quick concerns among Democrats about the man they hope will keep former President Donald Trump from returning to office. For his part, Trump made repeated false claims and provocative statements. But Trump seemed smoother and more vigorous than Biden, who is only three years older than the Republican ex-president.\n\nThe debate covered a wide range of topics and included a former president \u2014 Trump \u2014 not backing down from his vows to prosecute members of Congress and even the man he was debating. But the overarching theme was the difference between the candidates\u2019 performance.\n\nThe latest on the Biden-Trump debate\n\nThe debate was a critical moment\n\n\n\nwas a Take a look at the facts\n\n\n\nat Both candidates wasted no time sparring over policy during their 90-minute faceoff. These are the takeaways\n\nHere are some takeaways from the face-off.\n\nBiden doesn\u2019t allay fears about his age\n\nPresidential debates are often scored on style and impression more than substance. Trump was confident and composed, even as he steamrolled facts on abortion and immigration with false assertions, conspicuous exaggerations and empty superlatives. Biden was often halting, his voice raspy, even when he had the facts on his side. He had difficulty finishing his arguments and marshalling his attacks.\n\nTrump\u2019s supporters have seemed unconcerned about his relationship with the truth, and his performance and delivery helped him. Biden\u2019s supporters consistently express concern about the president\u2019s age and capacity and he did little to reassure them.\n\nOne of the first glimpses viewers got of Biden was when he lost his train of thought while making his case on tax rates and the number of billionaires in America \u2014 trailing off and looking down at his lectern before mumbling briefly and saying \u201cwe finally beat Medicare.\u201d When he tried to finish his point, he was cut off because of the time limits.\n\nAt other times, Biden made some puzzling non sequiturs that seemed to undercut what the campaign has said are his strong points, including the economy and abortion rights. As Biden critiqued Trump\u2019s economic record, the president suddenly pivoted to Afghanistan and how Trump \u201cdidn\u2019t do anything about that\u201d \u2014 although the botched withdrawal of Afghanistan is widely considered one of the lowest points of Biden\u2019s presidency.\n\nLater, as Biden singled out state restrictions on abortion, he confusingly pivoted to immigration and referred to a \u201cyoung woman who was just murdered\u201d by an immigrant. It was unclear what point he was trying to make.\n\nTrump won\u2019t condemn Jan. 6 attackers, giving Biden an opening\n\nTrump was cruising through the opening of the debate when he suddenly stumbled over the question of how he would reassure voters that he would respect his oath of office after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nHe continued to engage in denialism about the attack and refused to denounced those who attacked police and stormed the building by breaking doors and windows. He suggested that those charged will somehow be found one day to be innocent.\n\nMore than 1,400 people have been charged with federal offenses stemming from the riot. Of those, more than 850 people have pleaded guilty to crimes, including seditious conspiracy and assaulting police officers. About 200 others have been convicted at trial.\n\nTrump tried to avoid addressing the issue. He defended the people who stormed the Capitol, blaming Biden for prosecuting them. \u201cWhat they\u2019ve done to some people who are so innocent, you ought to be ashamed of yourself,\u201d Trump told Biden.\n\nTrump warned that the members of the congressional committee that investigated Jan. 6 could face criminal charges, as could Biden himself.\n\nBiden shot back: \u201cThe only person on this stage who\u2019s a convicted felon is the man I\u2019m looking at.\u201d\n\nTrump didn\u2019t back down from his vow to seek vengeance. Coupled with his refusal to condemn the Jan. 6 attackers, it made for a stark moment.\n\nAsked if he would accept the results of the election, Trump said, \u201cif it\u2019s a fair and legal and good election, absolutely,\u201d which notably is not an unqualified yes.\n\nBiden hits Trump on conviction, allegation of sex with a porn star\n\nIn what may well be a first in a presidential campaign, Trump called the president, Biden, a \u201ccriminal\u201d and said he could well be prosecuted after he leaves office. Biden then brought Trump\u2019s recent criminal trial in New York in which prosecutors presented evidence that Trump had sex with a porn actor.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have sex with a porn star,\u201d Trump said.\n\nOn abortion, Trump falsely says everyone is happy, and Biden misses an opportunity\n\nAbortion is an issue Democrats think could help deliver a victory in November. Trump in 2016 campaigned on overturning Roe v. Wade, and as president appointed three Supreme Court justices who provided the deciding votes revoking the 49-year right to the procedure. In response to a question from the moderators, Trump vowed not to go further if he returns to the White House, where his administration would have the authority to outlaw the abortion pill mifepristone, which is widely used.\n\nOverturning Roe is one of Trump\u2019s greatest political vulnerabilities, but on Thursday the former president contended everyone was happy with what he did.\n\n\u201cAs far as abortion\u2019s concerned it\u2019s back to the states,\u201d Trump said, contending the Founding Fathers would have been happy with the end of Roe. \u201cEverybody wanted it brought back.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not true. Polls have shown significant opposition to overturning Roe and voters have punished Republicans in recent elections for it. \u201cThe idea that the founders wanted the politicians to be the ones making the decisions about women\u2019s health is ridiculous,\u201d Biden shot back.\n\nIn a unanimous decision this month, the Supreme Court preserved access to mifepristone, a pill that was used in nearly two-thirds of all abortions in the U.S. last year.\n\nUntil Thursday, Trump had not detailed his position on access to the medication, but during the debate he indicated he supported the justices\u2019 decision, saying: \u201cI will not block it.\u201d\n\nBut when it was his turn to speak, Biden stumbled through his explanation of Roe, which he said \u201chad three trimesters\u201d \u2014 a lost opportunity for the Democrat to make a strong rhetorical case on an issue vital for his party.\n\n\u201cThe first time is between a woman and a doctor,\u201d Biden continued. \u201cSecond time is between a doctor and an extreme situation. A third time is between the doctor, I mean, between the women and the state.\u201d\n\nTrump blunts Biden\u2019s border progress with dark rhetoric\n\nIn recent months, Biden has tried to reverse his poor public standing over his handling of immigration, first by endorsing a bipartisan Senate proposal with some of the toughest border restrictions in recent memory and then, after that legislation collapsed, taking executive action to clamp down on migrants seeking asylum at the southern border.\n\nBut as Biden tried to tout the progress he\u2019s made, particularly the 40% drop in illegal border crossings since his border directive was implemented this month, Trump invoked his trademark dark and catastrophic rhetoric to paint a portrait of a chaotic border under Biden\u2019s watch.\n\nFor example, Trump argued that the migrants arriving at the U.S. border are coming from \u201cmental institutions\u201d and \u201cinsane asylums\u201d \u2014 a frequent refrain of his at rallies for which he has offered no evidence. He also claimed the U.S.-Mexico border is the \u201cmost dangerous place anywhere in the world\u201d and cited examples of immigrants in the U.S. illegally who had committed violent crimes.\n\nThough some immigrants do commit horrific crimes, a 2020 study published by the National Academy of Sciences found \u201cconsiderably lower felony arrest rates\u201d among people in the United States illegally than among legal immigrants or native-born. But Trump often benefits from his certitude.\n\nIt\u2019s the economy, and Trump says Biden is stupid\n\nThe debate began with Biden defending his record on the economy, saying he inherited an economy that was \u201cin a freefall\u201d as it was battered by the coronavirus pandemic and that his administration put it back together again.\n\nBut after Biden touted his administration\u2019s accomplishments \u2014 such as lowering the cost of insulin and the creation of millions of new jobs \u2014 Trump boasted that he oversaw the \u201cgreatest economy in the history of our country\u201d and defended his record on the pandemic.\n\nBiden retorted: \u201cHe\u2019s the only one who thinks that.\u201d But Trump responding by attacking him on inflation, arguing that he inherited low rates of inflation when he came into office in January 2021 yet prices \u201cblew up under his leadership.\u201d\n\nOne of Biden\u2019s strongest moments is about veterans\n\nBiden \u2014 whose deceased son, Beau, served in Iraq \u2014 had one of his most forceful moments when he went on the attack against Trump\u2019s reported comments in 2018 that he declined to visit a U.S. military cemetery in France because veterans buried there were \u201csuckers\u201d and \u201closers.\u201d\n\nIt was an argument that Biden, then the Democratic challenger, made against Trump in their first 2020 debate and one that the incumbent president has regularly used against Trump, framing him as a commander in chief who nonetheless disparages veterans. \u201cMy son was not a loser, was not a sucker,\u201d Biden said. \u201cYou\u2019re the sucker. You\u2019re the loser.\u201d\n\nTrump responded that the publication that initially reported this comments, The Atlantic, \u201cwas a third-rate magazine\u201d and had made up the quotes. But undercutting Trump\u2019s retort is the fact that his former chief of staff, John Kelly, confirmed those private remarks in a statement last fall.\n\n___\n\nFollow the AP\u2019s coverage of the 2024 election at https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024.",

This is after his \u201cterrible\u201d performance in the first US Presidential debate on Thursday. Though this may not be possible, some people are looking at potential candidates who could replace Biden. One such candidate is Gavin Newsom who is presently the Governor of the state of California, the hi-tech state of the US and home to the Silicon Valley . He is a supporter of Biden and may seem to be the ideal presidential nominee. However, there are several critics who are likely oppose his nomination, if at all Biden is replaced.He is from the city of San Francisco and is a fourth generation San Franciscan. Despite being dyslexic, he managed to finish his schooling and graduated from the Santa Clara University. He has written a book on dyslexia and has donated to create awareness regarding this learning disorder. He is a baseball player too. He was born in 1967.After graduating, he started his business. He has successfully established restaurants and hotels in the state of California. He married Jennifer Siebel after divorcing his first wife. He has four children.He started his political journey in 1996 with the Parking and Traffic Commission in San Francisco. Beginning in 2003, he served as the mayor of the San Francisco for two terms. He became a national figure when he supported same sex marriages. In 2019, he was elected as the Governor of California.Homelessness is on the rise in the state of California. Over one-third of all homeless people in the US are in California. There are safety issues with rising crime rates in California. Further, immigration has wreaked havoc in the state. The high taxes have only added to the woes of the people.The US has a dual constitution, one at the federal level and the other at the state level.

        "text": "Takeaways from Biden and Trump\u2019s presidential debate\nCNN \u2014\n\nPresident Joe Biden is three years and seven months older than former President Donald Trump.\n\nIn their debate Thursday night on CNN, the gap between the 81-year-old incumbent and his 78-year-old challenger seemed much larger.\n\nBiden, hoarse and displaying little vocal range, was often unable to express his differences with Trump with clarity. At one point, after Biden had trailed off as he defended his record on border security, Trump said: \u201cI really don\u2019t know what he said at the end of that sentence. I don\u2019t think he knows what he said, either.\u201d\n\nTrump, meanwhile, at times repeated his frequent election denialism. He said he\u2019d accept the results of the 2024 election if it\u2019s \u201cfair and legal,\u201d but then repeated his lies about fraud in the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a whiner, and you lost the first time,\u201d Biden said.\n\nIt was the first time either man had debated since 2020, and they made history Thursday night: It was the first time a sitting president and a former president had ever debated. The two clashed over abortion, immigration, foreign policy, inflation and more.\n\nTheir showdown took a bitter and personal turn. Biden highlighted Trump\u2019s criminal convictions. Trump responded by invoking Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, who was also recently convicted. Then Biden accused Trump of having sex with porn star Stormy Daniels while Trump\u2019s wife was pregnant.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have sex with a porn star,\u201d Trump said.\n\nHere are 11 takeaways from the CNN debate in Atlanta, moderated by Jake Tapper and Dana Bash:\n\nBiden\u2019s age problem just got a lot worse\n\nThe most important job for Biden on Thursday night was to put to rest voters\u2019 concerns about his biggest vulnerability \u2014 his age \u2014 and turn the election into a referendum on Trump.\n\nHe failed to do so.\n\nBiden was hoarse and at times unintelligible. Words often ran together. He stumbled, particularly when he tried to cite statistics and legislation. He rarely raised his voice to hammer home points of emphasis \u2014 missing opportunities to attack Trump over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, his Supreme Court appointments that led to the reversal of Roe v. Wade\u2019s abortion rights protections and more.\n\nTwo campaign sources said Biden has had a cold in recent days.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback See how Trump and Biden respond when asked about their age during the debate 04:03 - Source: CNN\n\nThough the Democratic primary is long over, his performance is sure to lead to more hand-wringing among party members over whether handing Biden a second nomination with only nominal opposition was the right move.\n\nIt also raises the stakes for September 10, when Biden and Trump are set to meet for their second and, as of now, final, debate, hosted by ABC.\n\nTrump pulls (some of) his punches on Biden\n\nFor a candidate who regularly attacks Biden on his age, Trump was fairly restrained during the president\u2019s numerous stumbles.\n\nAbout 20 minutes into the debate, Trump followed a Biden remark with a quick snipe, saying, \u201cI really don\u2019t know what he said at the end of that sentence. I don\u2019t think he does either.\u201d\n\nIt was the exception that proved the rule \u2013 and history suggests it was a kind of self- or campaign-imposed rule on Thursday night for Trump to not be seen taunting or mocking Biden\u2019s difficulties. Four years ago, the first general election debate of the cycle was a mess for Trump, who constantly interrupted Biden and shouted over the moderators. If not exactly a lesson learned, then his tone in Atlanta was a correction designed to erase memory of that damaging, helter-skelter performance.\n\nWhen Biden stumbled over a question about the national debt, trying to explain the benefits of raising taxes on the super-rich before losing steam and concluding with the declaration that \u201cWe finally beat Medicare,\u201d there was a sense that Trump would pounce.\n\nHe had his eyes trained on the president and his lips pursed for much of the rambling, difficult-to-discern answer. He almost winced at one point. But Trump then did a most un-Trump-like thing: he responded like a typical politician.\n\n\u201cWell, he\u2019s right: he did beat Medicare,\u201d Trump said, \u201cHe beat it to death.\u201d\n\nThen he continued on, railing about Biden\u2019s immigration policy.\n\nPeople watch the debate in Washington, DC. Tristen Rouse/CNN\n\nQuestions over Biden\u2019s goal\n\nBesides Biden\u2019s physical shortcomings Thursday night \u2013 a voice that failed him, a diminished appearance and a split screen face that was widely shared online \u2013 it wasn\u2019t readily clear after 90 minutes what objectives he entered the evening hoping to achieve.\n\nUnlike in their first meetings four years ago, when Biden put Trump\u2019s record under the microscope and offered a more hopeful vision for the country, his message Thursday was muddled and not just by his struggles finishing a thought.\n\nBiden was clearly on defense most of the night, but that was to be expected, as he is the incumbent. But his explanation for his record was often deep in the weeds of the policy of his first term and fell short of evoking the \u201cMiddle Class Joe\u201d image he cultivated for years.\n\nHis attacks on Trump were similarly uneven, and he struggled to fact check the former president on his lies \u2014 even ones that had been repeated for years. On the biggest issue for Democrats \u2013 abortion \u2013 Biden flailed. At times, his retorts were bogged down in statistics that were hard to follow, like this riff on the former president\u2019s tax cuts for the wealthy:\n\nPresident Joe Biden flips through his notes during the debate in Atlanta. Austin Steele/CNN\n\n\u201cWe have 1,000 trillionaires in America, billionaires in America, and what\u2019s happening, they\u2019re in a situation where they in fact, pay 8.2% in taxes. If they just paid 24% or 25% \u2013 either one of those numbers when they raise $500 million, billion dollars, I should say, in a 10-year period. We\u2019d be able to wipe out his debt.\u201d\n\nAt another point, he said Trump \u201cis the only president other than Herbert Hoover, who had lost more jobs than he had when he began since Herbert Hoover.\u201d\n\nHis canned rejoinders leaned on the collective thought of nameless constitutional scholars, historians and Nobel laureate economists to drive home his points.\n\nBiden is hardly the first incumbent to be tripped up by the initial debate. But his aides were supposedly aware of this curse and had over prepared the president during a week of intense preparation at Camp David.\n\nWhat was presented Thursday, though, not only failed to quiet concerns about Biden\u2019s capacity to fight on \u2013 it left voters with an unclear idea of what he\u2019s fighting for.\n\nBiden\u2019s one-liner offense\n\nThroughout the debate, Biden\u2019s offensive strategy was to again and again deploy one-liners to ding Trump.\n\nSome of the lines were standard Biden fare.\n\n\u201cEvery single thing he\u2019s said is a lie. Every single one,\u201d he shot at the former president at one point.\n\nIn another, he said, \u201cI\u2019ve never heard so much malarky in my life.\u201d\n\nAnd in a potentially bright spot for Biden, the president highlighted a 2020 report by The Atlantic that Trump had referred to American war dead as \u201csuckers\u201d and \u201closers.\u201d He invoked his son Beau, who died of brain cancer after a year in Iraq in which he was exposed to toxic fumes.\n\n\u201cMy son was not a sucker. You\u2019re a sucker. You\u2019re the loser,\u201d Biden said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Biden to Trump: 'You're the sucker, you're the loser' 01:56 - Source: CNN\n\nAnd during a riff about Trump being convicted for trying to cover up having an affair with Daniels, Biden said, \u201cYou have the morals of an alleycat.\u201d\n\nThe stark difference in addressing January 6\n\nPut simply: Biden was eager to address the events of January 6, 2021, head on as Trump moved to change the subject, and the difference in the responses between the two candidates were some of the starkest during the entire debate.\n\nWhen the debate veered toward the attack on the US Capitol, Trump didn\u2019t address it directly.\n\nHe described how the country, at the time, \u201chad a great border,\u201d that \u201cwe were energy independent,\u201d and that the United States had \u201cthe lowest taxes ever. We had the lowest regulations ever.\u201d\n\nThe former president did not address the speech he delivered to supporters ahead of the riot that day, during which he encouraged supporters to \u201cshow strength\u201d at the US Capitol.\n\nBiden, by contrast, said Trump \u201cencouraged those folks to go to Capitol Hill\u201d and that while the Capitol was under siege, Trump \u201csat there for three hours watching\u201d while staffers begged him to do something.\n\nTrump makes news with abortion pill stance\n\nIn a debate dominated by discussion on the economy, inflation, immigration and foreign policy, abortion should have been Biden\u2019s strongest topic. The US Supreme Court handed abortion rights supporters two wins this month and Democratic voters are still motivated by anger over the overturning of Roe v. Wade.\n\nInstead, it was one of his worst moments of the night. Biden struggled to explain his party\u2019s stance on abortion, rambled, appeared confused at times and, unprompted, gave Trump an opening to bring up crimes migrants have committed against Americans.\n\nEarlier this month, the Supreme Court dismissed a case that would have rolled back access to the abortion pill mifepristone. And Trump on Thursday backed the high court\u2019s ruling.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court just approved the abortion pill, and I agree with their decision to have done that and I will not block it,\u201d he said.\n\nFrom there, Trump reiterated his stance that regulating abortion should be left to the states, and repeated his false assertion that \u201cevery legal scholar\u201d wanted to end federal abortion protections. He said he supports exceptions for rape, incest and to protect the life of the mother.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a great thing,\u201d Trump said of abortion returning to the states.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a terrible thing,\u201d Biden shot back. \u201cThe fact is that the vast majority of constitutional scholars supported Roe when it was decided.\u201d\n\nBut while abortion should have been one of the president\u2019s strongest moments of the night, given the emphasis his campaign has placed on restoring access, Biden\u2019s answer instead took a confusing turn and gave Trump an opening to talk about crimes committed against Americans by migrants.\n\nA vibes fight about Israel and Gaza\n\nThere is no doubt that Trump would handle the war in Gaza much differently than Biden. But how?\n\n\u201cLet Israel finish the job,\u201d he told Biden, the suggestion being that the president has done too much to restrain the Israeli government and its military bombardment of Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nTrump did not say whether he would back a Palestinian state, but did insist that Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack inside Israel would have \u201cnever happened\u201d if he had been in the White House at the time. He also said that Biden has \u201dbecome like a Palestinian, but they don\u2019t like him because he\u2019s a bad Palestinian.\u201d That was probably intended as a jab to suggest Biden is too deferential to the Palestinians but also too ineffectual earn their respect.\n\nIt landed flat \u2013 if it landed at all.\n\nBiden didn\u2019t offer much himself. He talked up America\u2019s close alliance with Israel and made special note that the US is \u201cproviding Israel with all the weapons they need and when they need them.\u201d If he was fishing for progressive votes, there wasn\u2019t much to bite on.\n\nThe president also talked up the ceasefire deal he spoke about a few weeks ago that has yet to materialize. (It is, by all recent accounts, a non-starter with leaders on both sides.)\n\nThe next president \u2013 be it Biden or Trump \u2013 will have a massive job to do in the region. And that\u2019s especially true in Israel and Gaza, where when the fighting ends the US and other world powers will be called upon to negotiate some kind of peaceful path forward. But as their performances on Thursday night showed, there are no easy answers and the hard truths will be difficult to come by.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, left, and President Joe Biden take part in the CNN presidential debate on Thursday, June 27.

Will Lanzoni/CNN In pictures: Biden and Trump face off in CNN presidential debate Prev Next\n\nTrump ducks on deportations\n\nThe immigration section of the debate was mostly memorable for Biden\u2019s stumble.\n\nBut Trump did not directly answer a question about whether the severe immigration crackdown he has promised would involve deporting those who have been in the United States for decades, those with jobs and those whose spouses are US citizens.\n\nInstead, he pivoted into an attack on Biden, arguing that the president bears the blame for crime committed by undocumented immigrants since he took office.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re living right now in a rat\u2019s nest. They\u2019re killing our people,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019re killing our citizens at a level we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d\n\nBiden, who had sought to emphasize that illegal border crossings have dropped recently, shot back: \u201cEvery single thing he said was a lie.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s take on foreign policy: Blame Joe\n\nAs the former president tells it, the current one is not doing such a great job.\n\nThe US military \u201ccan\u2019t stand him\u201d for a number of reasons, most infamously his botched withdrawal from Afghanistan. Russian President Vladimir Putin was \u201cencouraged\u201d by him to invade Ukraine. Iran, which \u201cwas broke\u201d during his presidency, was freed up by him to wage a proxy war against Israel because of him.\n\nTrump painted a bleak picture of the world and global politics during the Biden era. He also, again, refused to make a clear commitment to NATO, instead bragging about his efforts to get members up to date on their dues. Putin\u2019s terms for ending the war, he said, \u201cwere not acceptable\u201d \u2013 but only after being pressed on the issue.\n\nBiden, in response, called it \u201cmalarkey.\u201d\n\nIt was Trump, he insisted, who emboldened Putin in the lead-up to Russia\u2019s invasion. If there was any \u201cencouraging,\u201d he added, it had come during Trump\u2019s four years of footsie with the autocrat.\n\nBiden\u2019s reasoning for continued US support for Ukraine broke down along two lines: First, that it is a priority and essential step because Putin, he believes, would not stop at Ukraine\u2019s western border. He also argued, as he\u2019s done in the past, that the existence of NATO inherently empowers the US \u2013 that such close allyship with Western Europe offers the US a stronger hand in all its interactions around the world.\n\nTrump makes a bid for Black and Latino voters\n\nAs the debate turned to Black voters, Trump took an opportunity to make a bid for Black and Latino voters and knock Biden on inflation.\n\nBiden\u2019s chances of winning in November are dependent on Black support in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and reach states like Georgia and North Carolina. But polling has shown that Trump is making modest inroads with some Black voters, specificially men, while others are disengaged from the election.\n\nBiden was asked what his message is to Black voters who have seen record low unemployment but still face disparities when it comes to wages, maternal health and incarceration rates. Biden touted his policies, including his efforts to reduce student loan debt, but acknowledged that costs are up.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t blame them for being disappointed, inflation is still hurting them badly,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThere\u2019s more to be done, considerably more to be done, but we\u2019ve gone a great deal so far, and I\u2019m not letting up and they know it.\u201d\n\nTrump blamed Biden for creating inflation and said his immigration policy has led to jobs losses for Black people.\n\n\u201cHe caused the inflation, and it\u2019s killing Black families, and it\u2019s killing Hispanic families and just about everybody,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe fact is that his big kill on the Black people is the millions of people that he\u2019s allowed to come in through the border. They\u2019re taking Black jobs now.\u201d\n\nThe conversation then turned to policing, as Biden said Trump tried to cut funding to police.\n\nTrump incorrectly said Biden referred to Black people as \u201csuper predators\u201d in the 1990s \u2013 that was former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton \u2013 and touted his work on criminal justice reform and opportunity zones with South Carolina Republican Sen. Tim Scott.\n\n\u201cAnd the biggest beneficiaries are Blacks, and that\u2019s why we have the best numbers with them in maybe ever,\u201d Trump said.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump speaks during the debate on Thursday. Will Lanzoni/CNN\n\nThe common thread: blaming inflation on the pandemic\n\nBiden and Trump landed on the same scapegoat when asked to explain their economic records: the pandemic. The back and forth over coronavirus for a moment made it feel like they were picking up where they left off in 2020.\n\nAsked at the top of the debate about one of the most persistent headwinds facing his reelection bid \u2013 inflation \u2013 Biden said he inherited an economy that was \u201cin freefall\u201d caused by Trump\u2019s stewardship of Covid-19.Biden said the pandemic was \u201cso badly handled\u201d by his predecessor. He quoted Trump saying the coronavirus was \u201cnot that serious\u201d when it arrived and poked fun at Trump\u2019s suggested remedy of injecting disinfectant into the body.\n\n\u201cWe put things back together,\u201d Biden said.\n\nTrump, for his part, blamed the pandemic for halting an economy he said was \u201cthe greatest economy in the history of our country\u201d \u2013 a familiar refrain from the former president.\n\n\u201cWe got hit with Covid and when we did we spent the money necessary so we didn\u2019t get hit with the great depression,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump \u2013 who racked up twice as much federal debt than Biden, according to a new nonpartisan report referenced by Tapper \u2013 went on to claim that he was about to start paying down the country\u2019s debt when the coronavirus first appeared. He then shifted the conversation to his successor\u2019s handling of the pandemic, including criticizing the vaccine mandates instituted by the Biden administration.",

        "text": "US Election: What If Biden Leaves 2024 Presidential Race\nUS President Joe Biden's woeful performance in the presidential debate against challenger Donald Trump has re-ignited questions about what would happen should the veteran Democrat step down as party flagbearer at the last minute.\n\nSuch a high-risk political U-turn would be unprecedented in modern American election history. Here's a look into how replacing the 81-year-old could be possible.\n\n- If a candidate leaves -\n\nTo designate a formal nominee, delegates from all 50 states attend their party's summer nominating convention to officially anoint a candidate based on primary voting.\n\nBiden overwhelmingly won the primary votes, and the party's roughly 3,900 delegates heading to the convention in Chicago this August are beholden to him.\n\nIf Biden exits, the delegates would have to find a replacement. That would mean bringing US politics back to the old days, when party bosses jostled to pick a nominee through deal-making in smoke-filled back rooms and endless rounds of voting.\n\nOn March 31, 1968 president Lyndon Johnson made the shock announcement in the middle of the Vietnam War that he would not seek reelection.\n\nThe move turned that year's convention, also in Chicago, into a political crisis with protesters in the street and left-leaning delegates angry at the pro-war stance of party-picked candidate Hubert Humphrey.\n\nFollowing the debacle, states more widely embraced the primary process and conventions have become well-oiled affairs, whose outcomes have been known in advance since they are determined by the primaries.\n\nIf a candidate must step down after being officially nominated at the convention, a party's formal governing body, either the Democratic National Committee or Republican National Committee, would nominate a new candidate in an extraordinary session.\n\n- Who might fill in? -\n\nSo far, the Democrats have circled the wagons around their designated nominee, at least when speaking on the record, with former president Barack Obama coming out to defend Biden.\n\nWhen asked about Biden potentially stepping aside, campaign communication director Michael Tyler told reporters aboard Air Force One there were \"no conversations about that whatsoever.\"\n\nA natural -- but not automatic -- pick to take Biden's place would be his running mate on the 2020 ticket, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nSent in Thursday night to put out the fire after the Democratic president's lackluster performance, the 59-year-old conceded Biden had been \"slow to start\" the debate but had \"finished strong.\"\n\nOtherwise, any of a number of strong Democratic politicians -- Governors Gavin Newsom of California, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania are mentioned -- might be called on.\n\nMeanwhile, could a strong third-party hopeful emerge? So far, no independent candidate is posing any danger to America's dominant two-party system.\n\nIn 1992, Texas billionaire Ross Perot, running as an independent, managed to win nearly 19 percent of the popular vote.\n\nBut in the end, because of the vagaries of the American electoral system, he did not receive a single one of the votes that matter most: those of the 538 members of the Electoral College that ultimately decide the winner.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

Why would you want to \u2014 did they want to replace Trump? Look at all the things \u2014 he\u2019s a convicted felon,\u201d she said.\n\nBrazil added that \u201cthe Democrats need to get together and stick with what they got and try to improve them with what they have instead of trying to replace it. You don\u2019t replace nothing like that.\u201d\n\nBrazil described the debate as \u201chorrible\u201d because \u201cTrump lied when he first opened up his mouth.\u201d\n\n\u201cBiden was trying to tell the truth, but by him being a stutterer and having problem speaking properly, and having a cold, he had a problem delivering his points because he was trying to fact-check Trump on everything,\u201d she added.",

        "text": "What happens if Joe Biden or Donald Trump withdraws from the 2024 presidential race?\nWritten by Saima Mehta\n\nThe first presidential debate in the United States, between current President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, has raised concerns about whether Biden, in particular, is fit to contest the elections in November.\n\nBefore the Friday debate too, there were doubts about the capabilities of Biden (81) and Trump (78), as they are the oldest candidates to stand for the post in US history. There have been several instances in recent months where Biden has made blunders in public \u2014 seemingly forgetting names and parts of speeches, and fumbling his words.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKate Bedingfield, Biden\u2019s former White House communications director, said on CNN, \u201cIt was a really disappointing debate performance from Joe Biden. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any other way to slice it. His biggest issue was to prove to the American people that he had the energy, the stamina \u2014 and he didn\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump seemed more in control, media outlets later fact-checked him for multiple false claims he made during the debate. He is also likely to be sentenced next month in the Stormy Daniels hush money case, which is just one of the several legal cases he is facing.\n\nGiven these scenarios, here is a look at how replacements of candidates may happen and whether such instances have happened in American elections in the past.\n\nHow a potential withdrawal can impact the nomination process\n\nCurrently, both Trump and Biden are their parties\u2019 presumptive nominees. Both of them are to be officially confirmed at the Republican National Convention and the Democratic National Convention, respectively, in the next few months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nParties organise these events so that delegates, who represent the party in constituencies from across the countries, can \u2018pledge\u2019 their support for one candidate. It is supposed to reflect consensus within the party and accord internal legitimacy to the candidate.\n\nWhen a candidate for president suddenly decides to step down, it dramatically alters the political scene with serious repercussions. In the rare event that a presidential candidate withdraws from the race, the Democratic or Republican National Committee would swiftly convene an emergency meeting to address the vacancy.\n\nThis critical gathering, typically headed by the party chairperson \u2014 currently Jaime Harrison for the Democrats and Ronna McDaniel for the Republicans \u2014 would bring together delegates representing all states and territories. The chairperson calls the emergency meeting, setting the stage for high-stakes deliberations. This meeting is often convened in Washington, D.C. but can be held virtually if time constraints or logistical issues arise.\n\nDelegates would then engage in discussions and votes to pledge their support to new candidate, who will then become the presumptive nominee. The selection process might involve considering runners-up from the primaries, those who performed well and have an existing support base, or other prominent party figures who could quickly unify the party and galvanise support from the voters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe urgency of updating ballots with the new candidate\u2019s name is a pressing concern, especially if the withdrawal occurs close to Election Day. This could lead to legal disputes over the validity of updated ballots and the logistics of implementing changes across multiple states. Additionally, sudden changes might cause confusion among voters, who could be unsure of who the new candidate is and how their votes will be counted.\n\nIs there a historical precedent for this?\n\nThere have been instances where candidates have dropped out or passed away during campaigns. The most notable case was in 1972 when the Democratic nominee for Vice President, Thomas Eagleton, had to withdraw after it was discovered he had mental health issues. Robert Sargent Shriver was then chosen as the replacement, after efforts from the party committee. However, the Democrat candidates lost the elections that year.\n\nSimilarly, in 1912, Vice President James Sherman, running for re-election with President William Howard Taft, died just days before the election. This created a unique challenge for the Republican Party.\n\nSherman\u2019s name remained on the ballot, as there was no time to replace him officially. The party assured voters that a new vice presidential candidate would be chosen if Taft won. Taft ultimately lost to Democrat Woodrow Wilson, but the incident underscored the need for clear procedures to handle unexpected vacancies, influencing future contingency planning within political parties.\n\nFuture scenarios and succession prospects\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe possibility of a withdrawal presents unprecedented challenges and opportunities, as the race is currently \u201ctoo close to a level playing field with confidence\u201d, according to The Washington Post opinion columnist Jason Willick. Any significant change would dramatically alter the result.\n\nFor Democrats, Vice President Kamala Harris emerges as a frontrunner due to her prominent role in the administration and appeal to progressive voters. Her experience as a senator and historic election as the first female, Black, and South Asian Vice President position her as a natural successor.\n\nPete Buttigieg, Secretary of Transportation, and Gavin Newsom of California are also considered strong options, with Buttigieg\u2019s appeal to younger demographics potentially bringing new energy to the campaign, and Newsom\u2019s importance within the party and progressive stance on issues making him a strong candidate.\n\nOn the Republican side, Ron DeSantis of Florida is a leading figure, recognised for his unwavering support for Trump\u2019s policies. Nikki Haley, former UN Ambassador, stands out for her appeal to a broader audience with her diplomatic background and moderate views. Mike Pence, former Vice President during the Trump administration, still holds sway among conservatives who value stability and continuity.\n\nThe writer is an intern with The Indian Express.",

        "text": "Biden's debate disaster: U.S. president freezes up against Trump\nIt was agony in Atlanta \u2014 for Joe Biden, for Democrats and for anyone around the world dreading another Donald Trump presidency.\n\nBecause the chances of that happening just grew.\n\nBiden appeared confused for an agonizing 14 seconds early on in a catastrophic moment that will enter the cringe-inducing annals in the history of presidential debates.\n\nHis voice raspy, his gaze distant, Biden's early slip-ups immediately prompted chatter about whether the sitting president should withdraw from the race. It had Democrats eyeing the calendar and wondering whether Biden might step aside before their convention in two months, so delegates could pick a different nominee.\n\nAfter the debate ended, there was hardly any need for a Republican on the post-event panels; the despondent Democrats were brutal enough, speculating about Biden dropping out.\n\n\"It's not just panic; it's pain,\" Democratic analyst Van Jones said in a cri de coeur on CNN, right after Thursday's debate ended.\n\n\"I love Joe Biden. I worked for Joe Biden \u2026 I love that guy. That's a good man,\" Jones said.\n\n\"[But] I think there's a lot of people who are going to want to see him consider taking a different course now. We're still far from our convention. And there is time for this party to figure out a different way forward, if he will allow us to do that.\"\n\nIn the generally friendly New York Times opinion section, columns carried headlines like, \"President Biden, it's time to drop out\" and \"Biden can not go on like this\" and \"President Biden is my friend. He must bow out of the race.\"\n\nWATCH | Analyzing the U.S. presidential debate: Trump attacks, Biden verbally stumbles at 1st presidential debate Duration 7:56 CBC's Adrienne Arsenault, Katie Simpson and Paul Hunter break down the U.S. presidential debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Each candidate took aim at the other\u2019s character and competence, but while Trump seemed confident and focused, Biden seemed to ramble and lose his train of thought in a shaky performance that has reinforced concerns about his age.\n\nBiden's performance distracted from Trump's deficiencies\n\nFormer Democratic senator Claire McCaskill, over on MSNBC, also described herself as heartbroken. She couldn't say whether Biden would remain the candidate and said she was being deluged with texts from terrified party donors and members of Congress.\n\nBiden's cognitive clunkers distracted from what ordinarily would have been the main post-debate story in any normal political era: Trump's own deficiencies.\n\nThe former president made wild claims; he showed no contrition for his role in one of the darkest moments in American history \u2014 the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021; and he wouldn't say unequivocally whether he will accept the results of this election.\n\nBut a well-respected, non-partisan U.S. elections analyst argued that the damage here was unquestionable: Biden lost ground, Amy Walter said.\n\nIt was Biden who asked for this debate , months earlier than usual, because he was keen to reset the race, where he's behind in most polls.\n\n\"Instead, only thing we're talking about is Biden's poor performance,\" tweeted Walter, the editor-in-chief of the Cook Political Report.\n\n\"[The] biggest problem for Biden now is that his base/donors are going to be super depressed and worried.\"\n\nIn other words, it's time to panic now. Unless you're rooting for Trump.\n\nThe opening moments of the debate, which tend to be the most watched, could easily have been a snapshot of the Biden presidency.\n\nHe's racked up some historic wins, with one of the most successful legislative records in the modern era, with bills on infrastructure, green energy, reshoring high-tech manufacturing, lowering drug prices, gun control, expanding NATO and stimulating new jobs, which roared back after the pandemic.\n\nBut he couldn't explain one such win.\n\nWATCH | Biden stumbles and Trump pounces: Biden stumbles on health-care answer as Trump pounces Duration 0:39 U.S. President Joe Biden appeared to lose his train of thought during a debate in Atlanta that aired on CNN with former president Donald Trump, saying, \u2018Look, we finally beat Medicare.\u2019 Trump responded by saying, \u2018He beat it to death.\u2019\n\n14 cringe-inducing seconds\n\nIn a lapse unimaginable for most occupants of his office, Biden veered off course into a ditch of non sequiturs and failed to find the road again.\n\nHe was trying to remind viewers that Trump's tax cuts had drained the public finances, piling on trillions in new debt ( which is true ); and that he, unlike Trump, wants tax hikes for billionaires.\n\nHe appeared to start making the point that tax hikes on billionaires could improve services for all Americans, correcting himself after he erroneously referred to trillionaires.\n\nHe couldn't correct what came next: \"With the COVID \u2026 Excuse me \u2026 Look.\" There were painful pauses, the clock ticking, ticking, and Biden concluded with, \"We finally beat Medicare.\"\n\nWhat he appeared to be referring to was how he beat the drug companies , forcing them to negotiate lower prices for seniors through the old-age Medicare program.\n\nThis was a historic achievement for a U.S. president. It's just not clear how it connects to spending new tax revenue from billionaires, as it was a cost-saving measure.\n\nThere was a similar moment shortly thereafter. During an exchange about the surge in irregular migration across the southern border, Biden made dubious claims about the drop in crossings, then concluded in a trail of incomplete thoughts.\n\nAt this point, Trump started mocking his opponent's cognitive state.\n\n\"I really don't know what he said at the end of that sentence,\" Trump said. \"I don't think he knows what he said, either.\"\n\nWATCH | Biden tells Trump he has the 'morals of an alley cat': Biden to Trump: \u2018You have the morals of an alley cat\u2019 Duration 1:02 After former U.S. president Donald Trump brought up the criminal conviction of Hunter Biden and accused U.S. President Joe Biden of interfering in the proceedings, Biden called Trump\u2019s claims \u2018outrageous\u2019 and \u2018simply a lie.\u2019 Biden then brought up Trump\u2019s ongoing criminal and civil legal issues.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, hasn't changed a bit\n\nTrump's own weaknesses have less to do with his age. Despite being only three years younger \u2014 78 to Biden's 81 \u2014 Trump hasn't changed significantly, in appearance or in manner, since he first ran for president nearly a decade ago.\n\nHe exaggerated his own achievements, claiming the best economy in U.S. history under his watch. It was, in fact, a very good economy, until it collapsed during the pandemic, but by no major measure was it the best ever.\n\nHe also made wild accusations, calling Biden a criminal. Never mind that Trump himself is now a convict , faces scores more criminal charges, and has also been found liable for fraud and sexual assault \u2014 while his party has tried to investigate Biden for nearly two years and failed to find a reason to impeach him.\n\nTrump also shrugged off an attempt to talk about Jan. 6. When the topic came up, he said only that the country was better off on Jan. 6, 2021, when he was still president.\n\nHe denied referring to military veterans as suckers and losers, which some of his former aides suggest he did ; Biden, whose late son Beau was a veteran, expressed indignation: \"You're the sucker; you're the loser,\" he said.\n\nWATCH | Trump on if he'll accept the election results: Trump says he\u2019ll accept 2024 results \u2018if it\u2019s a fair and legal and good election\u2019 Duration 0:43 Former U.S. president Donald Trump was repeatedly asked during a debate in Atlanta that aired on CNN if he will accept the results of the 2024 presidential election. During his reply, Trump said he would \u2014 on certain conditions \u2014 before claiming he wasn\u2019t going to run initially. \u2018I would be very happy to be someplace else,\u2019 he said.\n\nTrump also wouldn't promise to accept the next election results without caveats, a once-unthinkable thing for a major presidential candidate to say.\n\nAt this point Biden managed a rare, sharp jab on a substantive point: \"I doubt you'll accept it \u2014 because you're such a whiner.\"\n\nBut the debate devolved into an unseemly argument about physical vigour, about which man was a better golfer, and who was fit enough to carry his own golf bag.\n\nThis rumble between present-day and soon-to-be octogenarians might not be the debate America dreamed of; it is, however, the debate America got.\n\nThere is one thing this spectacle might have achieved, though: It might have reduced the chances that, come election day on Nov. 5, Donald Trump will be whining about the results.\n\n\"There is more than hand-wringing tonight,\" McCaskill said on MSNBC. \"I do think people feel like we are confronting a crisis.\"",

        "text": "The Legacy of the Civil Rights Act, 60 Years Later\nSixty years ago, on the heels of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, then-US President Lyndon B. Johnson signed into law a monumental piece of legislation: the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The act, which followed a years-long movement led by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., prohibited discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\n\nIn action, the Civil Rights Act dismantled many policies of the Jim Crow era that had codified segregation and discrimination against Black Americans and marked a triumph for leaders and organizers of the Civil Rights Movement. The law was signed on July 2, 1964, nearly 100 years after the United States abolished slavery in 1865 through the ratification of the 13th Amendment.\n\nIn recognition of the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act, we spoke with SIS professors Sarah Snyder and Omekongo Dibinga about the historical context of the law, its legacy, and how the fight for equality endures.\n\nHistorical Context\n\nPrior to his death, President Kennedy sent civil rights legislation to Congress in June 1963 as leaders of the Civil Rights Movement mobilized. The 1955 bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama, acted as the impetus for the Civil Rights Movement, resulting in an organized civil disobedience and protest movement that illuminated racial injustices permeating American society. The movement gained traction through nonviolent resistance and protest in the late 1950s and early 1960s.\n\nKennedy faced mounting political pressure both domestically and internationally to support civil rights legislation, according to Snyder. Domestic political allies who helped Kennedy win the presidential election were pushing his administration to bring forth change at the federal level, while international pressure mounted as photos of police violence against Black Americans were splashed across the front pages of newspapers around the globe.\n\n\u201cThis was a moment of incredible intensity in the Cold War, and the competition between the United States and its Western Allies with the Soviet Union could come down to basic issues like which system was going to be more respectful of the rights of different people,\u201d said Snyder. \u201cGovernments and peoples that were throwing off the yoke of colonialism didn't necessarily want to turn and align themselves with a system that was seen as racist or imperialist. So, the United States really wanted to distinguish itself, and it was hard to do when people in Africa and Southeast Asia would look at their newspaper and say, \u2018you know, I can identify with these children who are being attacked because they might be perceived as looking like me.\u2019 And so, it was it was really bad for the United States in terms of its foreign policy.\u201d\n\nAfter the assassination of Kennedy in December 1963, Snyder said international pressure to pass civil rights legislation \u201cmomentarily dissipated\u201d as people joined the international \u201coutpouring of grief.\u201d Kennedy\u2019s successor, Johnson, was quick to throw his support behind the Civil Rights Act and urged lawmakers to act, painting the legislation as a \u201cway to honor Kennedy,\u201d Snyder said.\n\nThe legislation faced immense opposition in Congress. According to the National Archives, opposition in the House of Representatives bottlenecked the bill in the House Rules Committee, while southern Democrats in the Senate threatened to filibuster the legislation to death. Snyder explained that opposition to the bill was largely rooted in racism, and \u201cthere were racists in both parties in the US.\u201d\n\nThrough compromise and legislative tinkering, the bill ultimately passed Congress and was signed into law by President Johnson on July 2, 1964.\n\nImmediate Impacts\n\nThe Civil Rights Acts of 1964 was signed 188 years after the Declaration of Independence was adopted, which declared that \u201call men are created equal\u201d and \u201cendowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\u201d Though these beliefs composed the founding cry of the United States, for decades, they only existed on paper for many Americans, including Black Americans.\n\nIn a speech about the Civil Rights Act, President Johnson acknowledged this fact, stating: \u201cWe believe that all men are created equal. Yet many are denied equal treatment. We believe that all men have certain unalienable rights. Yet many Americans do not enjoy those rights. We believe that all men are entitled to the blessings of liberty. Yet millions are being deprived of those blessings\u2014not because of their own failures, but because of the color of their skin.\u201d\n\nSIS professor Omekongo Dibinga said the signing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was a \u201clandmark decision\u201d that \u201creally set the standard for any fight for equality in the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor Black people, it was the belief that, within this real time, within this real period, we can actually start having access to making America as Dr. King said, as good as its promise for everybody,\u201d Dibinga said. \u201cTo actually put this down on paper, the immediate effect for Black people was: it was very powerful, and it meant so much to the community.\u201d\n\nOnce codified, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 banned discrimination and segregation based on race, religion, national origin, and sex. The law applied to government agencies, public schools, employers, and private institutions that received federal funds.\n\nPresident Johnson\u2019s administration acted one year later to further expand civil rights for Black Americans through the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The act outlawed discriminatory voting practices and banned the tactics designed to keep Black Americans from voting. It was signed in the months after Bloody Sunday, when law enforcement officers beat and attacked activists in Selma, Alabama, during a march for voting rights for Black Americans.\n\nLegacy\n\nReflecting on the legacy of the Civil Rights Act 60 years later, Dibinga emphasized that the act paved the way for future fights for equality, including gay marriage.\n\n\u201cThe basis of [marriage equality] was the Civil Rights Act,\u201d Dibinga said. \u201cAll of the amendments that Black people have fought for in this country, they never only benefited Black people. Any type of discrimination suit that has been used against Black people that was challenged with the Civil Rights Act has been used by other groups.\u201d\n\nHe later added, \u201cEvery time we fought for rights in this country, we've made rights more expansive for other people. I think that's one of the greatest legacies of the Civil Rights Act because when you look at it, you're saying that this country belongs to everybody. And if it's going to belong to everybody, everybody should have equal protection.\u201d\n\nSnyder echoed a similar sentiment, noting that the Civil Rights Act was an \u201cachievement for the Civil Rights Movement\u201d that ultimately led to \u201cnew forms of resistance and new forms of activism.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it's useful to think about it as a turning point, rather than solely a culmination of something,\u201d Snyder said.\n\nThe Ongoing Fight for Equality\n\nSixty years after the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the fight for equal rights remains. Dibinga noted the renewed fight for reproductive freedom after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and pointed to the court\u2019s recent decision to end affirmative action in higher education by arguing it violated the Civil Rights Act.\n\nSeveral organizations have formed in recent years to advance the fight for equal rights, including the National Action Network, Black Voters Matter, and the Poor People\u2019s Campaign, among others. In addition to these grassroots movements, Dibinga emphasized that the fight for equality comes down to legislation.\n\n\u201cWe need to start voting in larger numbers at every level and understand that voting is the beginning of the process; it's not the end,\u201d Dibinga said. \u201cWe have to mobilize to vote. We have to continue to do that because that's one of the many ways that we can make sure that our legacy and what we fought for in this country are preserved.\u201d\n\nAs the 2024 election approaches, Dibinga stressed that is important for voters to understand the freedoms that are at stake.\n\n\u201cLet's get together and continue to fight for an America where our daughters can have more rights than our wives and our mothers,\u201d Dibinga said. \u201cLet's fight for an America where everybody can get access to education. Let's fight for an America where we're not going to start to have segregation on the books again in our schools.\u201d",

On both sides of the aisle, politicians said that Romney won the Oct. 3 debate, and that Obama lacked enthusiasm. Still, Obama fought back and was able to win a second term that November.\n\nIn the aftermath of CNN\u2019s presidential debate in Atlanta, many Democrats have decried Biden\u2019s performance, some sharing that the debate \u201churt\u201d their prospects at retaining the White House come elections in November.\n\nObama, though, is remaining staunch in his backing of the incumbent\u2019s campaign. He stated that last night\u2019s performance by Biden\u2014in which the 81-year old mumbled, trailed off at points, and repeatedly lost his trains of thought\u2014did not change the stakes of the election in November. He critiqued Trump, 78, calling him a liar.\n\nREAD MORE: Can Joe Biden Be Replaced as the Nominee?

        "text": "Ex CIA Insider Issues Urgent Warning of Economic and Social Turmoil Post-2024 Election\nPredicting significant market crashes and civil unrest, former CIA advisor Jim Rickards advises urgent preparatory measures as the U.S. approaches polarizing election\n\nNEW YORK, June 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- With the 2024 Presidential Election approaching, Paradigm Press Group's Jim Rickards, a highly respected economist and former advisor to the CIA, Pentagon, and White House, is sounding the alarm on an impending national crisis. Known for his accurate predictions of the 2008 Great Recession, Trump\u2019s 2016 Election win, and the Covid Crisis of 2020, Rickards now warns of social and economic chaos that could follow this election.\n\nRickards-New\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Rickards\n\n\u201cThe 2024 election is poised to be one of the most tumultuous events in American history,\u201d Rickards states. \u201cWe are facing the potential for a 50% market crash, the collapse of the US dollar, and widespread civil unrest. The time to prepare is now.\u201d\n\nKey points of Ex CIA Rickards\u2019 urgent warning:\n\nElection-Triggered Market Crash: Rickards foresees a massive stock market downturn, with potential losses exceeding 50%, and a significant devaluation of the US dollar. Civil Unrest and Possible Martial Law: His forecast includes a high probability of violent riots and social disorder, possibly leading to the imposition of martial law and temporary suspension of civil rights. Immediate Action Required: Rickards outlines five essential steps Americans should take immediately to protect their wealth and personal safety. Proven Track Record: With a history of accurate predictions, Rickards\u2019 insights and strategies are based on extensive experience and expertise.\n\nThe 2024 Presidential Election could be the \u2018Tipping Point\u2019\n\nRickards outlines several reasons as to why the stock market could fall at any moment following the election.\n\nElection Chaos and Legal Challenges : Rickards suggests that the 2024 Presidential Election could be similar to the 2000 election but on a much larger scale. This could lead to a prolonged period of uncertainty, causing investors to panic and sell off their stocks.\n\nRefusal to Transfer Power and Civil Unrest: If Trump wins the election, but is prevented from taking office by the current establishment, Rickards predicts widespread civil unrest to break out. Violent protests, clashes with law enforcement, and potential declarations of martial law could create tremendous fear and uncertainty, driving a massive sell-off in the stock market.\n\nCollapse of the US Dollar : Rickards foresees a scenario where the political instability resulting from election chaos and civil unrest leads to a loss of confidence in the US dollar. As investors seek safer assets, there could be a rapid devaluation of the dollar, causing a fight from dollar-denominated assets, including stocks.\n\nIncreasing Inflation: We still have an inflation problem. The combination of government spending, policies, and political instability could lead to hyperinflation. Rickards warns that inflation could become \u201c1000 times worse\u201d than current levels, eroding the value of investments and causing a stock market crash as investors try to preserve their wealth.\n\nPolicy and Governance Issues: Rickards notes that we can not continue to sustain the current administration\u2019s policies on immigration and spending. If things remain, we could be headed towards economic instability. For instance, massive government spending could lead to a fiscal crisis, where the government is unable to service its debt, causing a loss of confidence in the financial system.\n\nHistorical Comparison: Rickards being one who successfully predicted the 2008 financial crisis, implies that similar systemic risks are present today. He suggests that underlying economic weaknesses, combined with political instability, could lead to a sudden market downturn similar to the collapse experienced in 2008.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAbout Jim Rickards Jim Rickards is a distinguished lawyer, economist, and investment banker with over five decades of experience on Wall Street and in international finance. He has advised the highest levels of government, including: the CIA, Pentagon, and White House. Jim has also authored several best-selling books on economic policy and financial markets. Known for his accurate predictions of the 2008 Great Recession, Trump\u2019s 2016 Election win, and the Covid Crisis of 2020, Rickards now warns of catastrophic consequences that could follow this election. Take the necessary next steps, NOW Jim has prepared an entire brief on how every American can prepare themselves for the potential economic and social destruction following the upcoming election.

        "text": "Key takeaways from the US presidential debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump\nNinety minutes, two commercial breaks and no studio audience.\n\nThe stakes were high for a historically early US presidential debate between current president Joe Biden and his predecessor, Donald Trump.\n\nJoe Biden had to show he was up to the job, in the face of mounting concerns about his mental and physical fitness.\n\nDonald Trump had to appear presidential and show Americans he wanted to win back the White House to fight for their interests, rather than airing grievances about the 2020 election and the criminal cases against him.\n\nBut neither man exactly lived up to those expectations, with Biden bumbling and Trump blustering.\n\nHere are the key takeaways from round one of Trump v Biden.\n\n1. Biden appears frail and has a brain fade\n\nIt's hard to overestimate the amount of angst there was in Democratic circles ahead of this debate about whether Joe Biden could put in a robust performance.\n\nThe White House has repeatedly pushed back on reports that the president is slipping mentally.\n\nIt's hard to see how the party and the majority of Americans \u2014 who, according to polls, think the 81-year-old is simply too old to seek another term \u2014 will be reassured by Joe Biden's performance.\n\nLess than 15 minutes in, there was a cringeworthy moment when he appeared to lose his train of thought, trailing off on an answer about health care benefits.\n\n\"Making sure that we are able to make every single solitary person\u2026 eligible for what I've been able to do with the uh\u2026 COVID \u2014 excuse me, with dealing with everything we have to deal with\u2026 uh\u2026 look\u2026 if\u2026 we finally beat Medicare,\" the president said before being cut off.\n\nBiden appeared confused for much of the debate while Trump spoke. (Reuters: Marco Bello)\n\nTrump took that opportunity to hit back with: \"Well, that's right. He did beat Medicare. He beat it to death.\"\n\nJoe Biden's voice was raspy and quiet from the outset and he often appeared to struggle to round off his sentences, tripping over his own words.\n\nThese are hallmarks of the way the president speaks but are becoming more pronounced with age, and this was a particularly bad night in that regard.\n\nReporters being briefed by the Biden campaign said they were being told the voice issues were due to a cold.\n\nThose reports didn't start to filter through until the debate was well underway and will likely to be the focus of scrutiny in the wash-up.\n\nIn comparison, Donald Trump appeared energetic and his voice was commanding.\n\nHe too has had some seniors' moments in recent months, confusing people and dates, but on the whole, he was sharp tonight.\n\n\"I really don't know what he said at the end of that sentence, I don't think he knows what he said, either,\" Trump said at one point about his opponent.\n\nBiden's performance improved a little as time went on, but not enough to reverse an overall impression of frailty.\n\n2. Trump blustered and deflected\n\nIt was a more nimble and disciplined Trump than was on display four years ago.\n\nEach candidate had two minutes to answer questions, but Trump often used the beginning of his time to rebut what Biden had said or steer the answer to his pet issues, often the issue of illegal migration on the southern border.\n\nModerator Dana Bash had to press him several times to try and get an answer on whether he would accept the result of the election.\n\n\"If it's a fair and legal and good election, absolutely,\" the former president said.\n\nTrump deflected a question about accepting election results three times. (Reuters: Brian Snyder)\n\nHe ignored a question about whether Russian president Vladimir Putin's terms for the war in Ukraine were acceptable by talking about veterans' dislike for Biden.\n\nHe also tried to avoid directly answering a question about his role in the January 6 attack on the US Capitol.\n\nCNN's up-front rule about not being able to fact-check either candidate's responses in real time also appeared to work to his advantage.\n\nAmong his wilder claims, that abortion rights allowed babies to be killed after birth.\n\n3. Alley cats, porn stars and golf handicaps \u2014 things got nasty\n\nMuted microphones didn't stop the name-calling.\n\nBiden went on the attack over Trump's criminal convictions, accusing him of having sex with a porn star while his wife was pregnant.\n\n\"I didn't have sex with a porn star,\" Trump responded.\n\nDonald Trump found guilty in criminal 'hush money' trial Photo shows Donald Trump in court The jury in Donald Trump's \"hush money\" trial finds the former president guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records, a felony that could result in prison time.\n\nBiden also brought up the civil cases Donald Trump has faced, with a New York jury finding him liable for sexually abusing writer E Jean Carroll.\n\n\"You have the morals of an alley cat,\" Biden fired at his opponent.\n\nAs they discussed the issue of Trump reportedly referring to veterans as suckers and losers, Biden also went on the offensive.\n\nHis son Beau served in the military, and Joe Biden claims, without evidence, that it was his exposure to a burn pit in Iraq that led to the brain cancer that eventually killed him.\n\n\"My son was not a loser. He was not a sucker. You're the sucker. You're the loser.\"\n\nBiden threw jabs at Trump and referenced his felony conviction. (AP: Gerald Herbert)\n\nTrump said the sucker and loser quote was made up.\n\nTrump accused Biden of being the \"worst president in the history of our country\".\n\nClose to the end of the debate, things descended into the surreal with the two candidates getting into an argument over golf handicaps.\n\nTrump claimed to be still winning club championships.\n\nBiden offered to play him, saying he got his handicap down to a six when he was vice-president.\n\nTrump said that this was Biden's \"biggest lie of all\".\n\n\"I've seen your swing. I know your swing. Let's not act like children,\" he said.\n\n4. Abortion, immigration and the economy\n\nTrump attacked Biden over the economy, claiming his administration oversaw \"the greatest economy in history\".\n\nBiden pointed out there were fewer jobs at the end of Trump's term than at the start, but Trump was leaning into what many Americans were feeling.\n\nDespite the macro indicators showing the economy is improving, people are still struggling with increased prices and a sense that they are worse off.\n\nOn abortion, Biden attacked Trump for taking credit for appointing the Supreme Court justices who overturned the constitutional right to abortion two years ago and said if he is re-elected, he will work to enshrine the right to abortion into law.\n\nBoth candidates debated policies and made claims about abortion and the economy. (Reuters: Brian Snyder)\n\nThe Democrats' support of reproductive rights was a factor in their better-than-expected performance in the mid-terms and they are hoping it will be a winner again in November.\n\nBut even on this question, Biden appeared bumbling at times, and wandered into very odd territory as he tried to counter Trump's claims that migrants crossing the border illegally were raping women.\n\n\"There's a lot of young women being raped by their in-laws, by their spouses, brothers and sisters, it's just ridiculous\", Biden claimed.\n\nThere is no evidence of a spike in crime perpetrated by migrants, but Trump has highlighted a number of recent cases in which women have been raped or killed by people found to be in the US illegally.\n\nTrump several times successfully turned the conversation to the border, hitting Biden on an issue he is seen as vulnerable on.\n\nBiden reminded the audience that Trump torpedoed a bipartisan border bill, but again, his delivery and the nuance of this argument may mean it's lost on many viewers not tuning in to daily politics.\n\n5. The wash-up\n\nThere's no denying this debate went badly for the president and the early takes are stinging.\n\n\"A debate disaster\", headlines the Atlantic.\n\nCNN correspondent John King described it as \"game-changing\".\n\n\"There is a deep, a wide, and a very aggressive panic in the Democratic party', he said.\n\nOn MSNBC, David Plouffe, a veteran Democratic strategist who managed Barack Obama's 2008 campaign, called it a \"Defcon 1 moment\".\n\n\"The concern level is quite high\", he told the network.\n\nVice-President Kamala Harris acknowledged President Biden's \"slow start\", but told CNN \"it was a strong finish\".\n\nThe vice-president said it wasn't about the last 90 minutes, but about the last three and a half years.\n\nThe idea of Joe Biden calling it quits at this late stage has been raised before, but generally in quiet, respectful terms.\n\nThat's all changed after tonight, and if he does stay it could be very difficult for Joe Biden to turn things around in the next four months.",

Medicare provides health coverage to more than 65 million Americans age 65 and over.\n\nWith more than 11,000 Americans now turning 65 every day, according to estimates from the Retirement Income Institute at the Alliance for Lifetime Income, more retirees are relying on support from both programs.\n\nWhen voters age 50 and up were asked how important Social Security is to their vote this November, 80% said it is extremely important or very important, a recent AARP survey found.\n\nWhile those voters want a candidate who will protect the program, their support is still up for grabs, according to the results.\n\nBoth Biden and Trump moved to win those voters on Thursday. Here's what they said.",
