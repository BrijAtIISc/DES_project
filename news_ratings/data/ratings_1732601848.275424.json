        "text": "Voters\u2019 views of Trump and Biden differ sharply by religion\nThe U.S. electorate continues to be sharply divided along religious lines.\n\nThe latest Pew Research Center survey finds that most registered voters who are White Christians would vote for Republican Donald Trump over Democrat Joe Biden if the 2024 presidential election were held today. More than half of White Christians think Trump was a \u201cgreat\u201d or \u201cgood\u201d president and don\u2019t think he broke the law in an effort to change the outcome of the 2020 election.\n\nIn stark contrast, most registered voters who are Black Protestants or religious \u201cnones\u201d \u2013 those who self-identify as atheists, agnostics or \u201cnothing in particular\u201d \u2013 would vote for Biden over Trump. Large numbers in these groups also say Trump was a \u201cterrible\u201d president and that he broke the law trying to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\nHow we did this Pew Research Center conducted this analysis to highlight religious differences in U.S. voters\u2019 views about the 2024 presidential election. For this analysis, we surveyed 8,709 adults \u2013 including 7,166 registered voters \u2013 from April 8 to 14, 2024. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology. Here are the questions used for this report, along with responses, and the survey methodology. Here are details about sample sizes and margins of error for groups analyzed in this report.\n\nReligion and the 2024 presidential election\n\nWhile most White Christian voters say they would vote for Trump over Biden if the election were held today, there are some differences by religious tradition. Trump draws support from:\n\n81% of White evangelical Protestant voters\n\n61% of White Catholics\n\n57% of White Protestants who are not evangelical\n\nBy contrast, 77% of Black Protestant voters say they would vote for Biden over Trump. Most religious \u201cnones\u201d also say this, including:\n\n87% of atheist voters\n\n82% of agnostics\n\n57% of those whose religion is \u201cnothing in particular\u201d\n\nThese presidential preferences reflect the partisan leanings of U.S. religious groups. White Christians have been trending in a Republican direction for quite some time, while Black Protestants and religious \u201cnones\u201d have long been strongly Democratic.\n\nThe Center\u2019s new survey includes responses from Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus and people from many other religious backgrounds, as well as adherents of smaller Christian groups like Hispanic Protestants and members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (widely known as Mormons). However, the survey does not include enough respondents from these smaller religious categories to be able to report on them separately.\n\nChurch attendance and voting preferences in 2024\n\nAmong Christians, support for Trump is somewhat higher among regular church attenders than non-churchgoers. Overall, 62% of Christian voters who say they go to church at least once or twice a month support Trump over Biden. Among Christians who go to church less often, 55% would vote for Trump if the election were today.\n\nAmong White evangelical Protestant voters, 84% of regular churchgoers say they would vote for Trump, compared with 77% of White evangelicals who don\u2019t go to church regularly.\n\nWhite nonevangelical Protestants are the only Christian group in which support for Trump is significantly stronger among nonattenders than among regular churchgoers.\n\nVoters\u2019 views of Biden and Trump as presidents\n\nAbout three-quarters of White evangelical Protestant voters say Trump was a \u201cgreat\u201d (37%) or \u201cgood\u201d (37%) president. Roughly half of White Catholics and White nonevangelical Protestants share this view.\n\nWhen it comes to Biden, atheists and Black Protestants rate the current president\u2019s performance most favorably. Roughly half of voters in each of these groups say Biden is a great or good president.\n\nOverall, Trump gets higher marks on these questions than Biden. This is because Trump supporters are more inclined to say he was a great or good president than Biden supporters are to say the same about him.\n\nViews of whether Trump broke the law in effort to change 2020 election outcome\n\nPeople in the religious groups that are most supportive of Biden tend to think Trump broke the law in an effort to change the outcome of the 2020 election. Most atheists (83%) say this, as do 70% of Black Protestants and 63% of agnostics.\n\nBy contrast, just 16% of White evangelical Protestants say Trump broke the law trying to change the 2020 election outcome. Another 15% of White evangelicals say they think Trump did something wrong but did not break the law, while the largest share by far (47%) say Trump did nothing wrong.\n\nNote: Here are the questions used for this report, along with responses, and the survey methodology.",

        "text": "What do the US campus protests mean for Joe Biden in November?\nThe policies of Joe Biden and Democrats towards Israel, which have prompted thousands of students across the country to protest, could affect the youth vote for Biden and hurt his re-election chances, experts have warned, in what is already expected to be a tight election.\n\nThousands of students at universities across the US have joined with pro-Palestine rallies and, most recently, encampments, as Israel\u2019s war in Gaza has killed more than 34,000 people.\n\nSome of the protests began as a call to encourage universities to ditch investments in companies that provide weapons and equipment to the Israeli military. But as the Biden administration has continued to largely support Israel, the president has increasingly become a focus of criticism from young people. Polling shows that young Americans\u2019 support for Biden has been chipped away since 2020.\n\nWith Biden narrowly trailing Trump in several key swing states, it\u2019s a voting bloc the president can ill afford to lose.\n\n\u201cThe real threat to Biden is that younger voters, especially college-educated voters, won\u2019t turn out for him in the election,\u201d said Jonathan Zimmerman, a professor of history of education at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect that the protesters on campuses today are going to vote for Trump, almost none of them will. That\u2019s not the danger here. The danger is much simpler: that they simply won\u2019t vote.\u201d\n\nTurnout could be key to Biden winning November\u2019s election, given the devotion of Trump\u2019s base, and there are signs that Biden\u2019s handling of the situation in Gaza is already costing him support.\n\nIn Wisconsin, which Biden won by just 21,000 votes in 2020, more than 47,000 people voted \u201cuninstructed\u201d in the state\u2019s Democratic primary, as a protest against the government\u2019s support for Israel. It came after more than 100,000 voters in Michigan\u2019s Democratic primary cast ballots for \u201cuncommitted\u201d: Biden won the state by just 154,000 votes four years ago.\n\nBiden triumphed in Pennsylvania by a similarly small margin, and average polling shows him currently trailing Trump in the state, albeit by less than two points. Protests at campuses at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Pittsburgh probably have Biden\u2019s campaign worried.\n\n\u201cIn states like Pennsylvania, the margins are going to be so small, that it\u2019s at least possible that a couple thousand people not turning out, or voting for one of the third-party candidates, could swing the election one way or the other,\u201d Zimmerman said.\n\nIn April, a Harvard poll found that Biden leads Trump by eight percentage points among 18- to 29-year-olds, down from a 23-point lead Biden had at the same point in 2020. In the same survey, 51% of young Americans said they support a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, while just 10% said they were opposed.\n\nJust as worrying for the voting figures was the sentiments Harvard unearthed. Nearly 60% of 18-to 29-year-olds said the country is \u201coff on the wrong track\u201d. Only 9% believe things are \u201cgenerally headed in the right direction\u201d.\n\nOn Tuesday, even the College Democrats of America \u2013 a centrist, Biden-supporting organization \u2013 criticized their own party.\n\n\u201cEach day that Democrats fail to stand united for a permanent ceasefire, two-state solution, and recognition of a Palestinian state, more and more youth find themselves disillusioned with the party,\u201d the group said in a statement.\n\nThe White House said that Biden had \u201creiterated his clear\u201d opposition to Israel invading the Gaza city of Rafah, where about 1.4 million Palestinians are sheltering, in a call with Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s prime minister, over the weekend.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That came after Biden said he condemned \u201cthe antisemitic protests\u201d, although the president added: \u201cI also condemn those who don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on with the Palestinians.\u201d\n\nZimmerman said \u201cthe most obvious\u201d precedent for student protests influencing an election was in 1968, when Lyndon B Johnson dropped his re-election campaign in the face of anti-Vietnam war protests. Those protests, which had begun in 1965, weren\u2019t the only reason for Johnson\u2019s dropping out of the Democratic primary, Zimmerman said, but played a major role.\n\nThe Vietnam-era movement grew to something much larger in scale than the current demonstrations, although with hundreds of students arrested so far, there is evidence the movement is growing, and according to National Students for Justice in Palestine, an advocacy group, there are more than 50 encampments at universities around the US.\n\n\u201cA heavy-handed response to protests is basically not going to put them down. It\u2019s just going to increase the protests and strengthen them, because then it becomes a question of free speech,\u201d said Ralph Young, a history professor at Temple University whose work has focused on protest movements in the US.\n\nIf the protests against Israel\u2019s conduct \u2013 and against Biden\u2019s ability or willingness to reel Israel in \u2013 continue, it will not be an issue for Trump. In a Gallup poll in March, 71% of Republicans said they approved of \u201cthe military action Israel has taken in Gaza\u201d, compared with just 36% of Democrats.\n\n\u201cThe main negativity on this is for the Democrats. What Biden needs in order to win is a very heavy turnout of Democrats. If he loses even 10% of the Democratic vote and even if that does not go to Trump, I think the chances are slim for Biden to get re-elected,\u201d Young said.\n\n\u201cIf there is a ceasefire, or if things ease up, then maybe cooler heads will prevail and things will settle down. Maybe then the protests will not have as much of an impact on the election. But the longer they go on, the more impact they will have.\u201d\n\nBiden v Trump: What\u2019s in store for the US and the world?\n\nOn Thursday 2 May, 3-4.15pm ET, join Tania Branigan, David Smith, Mehdi Hasan and Tara Setmayer for the inside track on the people, the ideas and the events that might shape the US election campaign.

And about half of the public follow news regarding presidential elections very or extremely closely compared to about a third who say the same about policies or issues, or state and local elections. Only a quarter of adults say they follow news about local and state ballot initiatives very or extremely closely.\n\nThe public gets news about elections from a variety of sources, yet national and local organizations stand out as most frequently used\n\nAdults rely predominantly on national or local news organizations for their election news. Social media platforms or information shared by friends or family rank as the second-most-frequently used sources for election news. In contrast, voter guides from news organizations, candidate websites or social media, or input from community or faith leaders, are far less frequently used for election news.\n\nTrust of the most frequently used news sources about the 2024 election is somewhat low\n\nDespite reliance on traditional national or local news sources for election news, about half have a moderate or great deal of confidence in the information they receive from these sources. And only about 1 in 10 adults express a great deal of confidence in them.\n\nThis moderate level of confidence in news regarding the 2024 elections is similar to the public\u2019s confidence \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 in the accuracy of vote counting in the upcoming election. According to a December 2023 AP-NORC poll, 46% of adults express a great deal or quite a bit of confidence that votes in the 2024 presidential election will be counted accurately. Another 23% express a moderate amount of confidence, while 31% have little or no confidence at all.\n\nThe public holds a number of concerns about news coverage of the 2024 election\n\nRoughly half of adults say they are extremely or very concerned about news organizations reporting inaccurate or unverified information, as well as focusing excessively on divisions or controversies in their coverage of the 2024 election. About 4 in 10 are worried that the media may report news favoring one side, utilize generative artificial intelligence (AI) for story creation, prioritize speculation on election outcomes over addressing important issues, or fail to represent local community perspectives. Fewer are concerned about news media prioritizing election coverage at the expense of other relevant topics.\n\nThe public has similar preferences for coverage from national and local news organizations\n\nThe survey asked respondents which topics or aspects of the election they would like to see covered more during the campaigns to help them make decisions about the election.\n\nFor both local and national news organizations, the topics the public anticipates they would want covered most are the candidates\u2019 values or character or their policy positions. About 2 in 3 adults say they would like national and local news media to cover how votes are tabulated, legal troubles or investigations tied to the candidates, and the public\u2019s views on key social issues. About half of adults express a desire for coverage from these outlets about who is ahead or behind in the polling. These priorities largely do not differ between local and national news outlets.\n\n\u00bb Next chapter: Election news, race and ethnicity",

        "text": "How Far Trump Would Go\nThis feature was published in April 2024.\n\nDonald Trump thinks he\u2019s identified a crucial mistake of his first term: He was too nice.\n\nWe\u2019ve been talking for more than an hour on April 12 at his fever-dream palace in Palm Beach. Aides lurk around the perimeter of a gilded dining room overlooking the manicured lawn. When one nudges me to wrap up the interview, I bring up the many former Cabinet officials who refuse to endorse Trump this time. Some have publicly warned that he poses a danger to the Republic. Why should voters trust you, I ask, when some of the people who observed you most closely do not?\n\nAs always, Trump punches back, denigrating his former top advisers. But beneath the typical torrent of invective, there is a larger lesson he has taken away. \u201cI let them quit because I have a heart. I don\u2019t want to embarrass anybody,\u201d Trump says. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll do that again. From now on, I\u2019ll fire.\u201d\n\nSix months from the 2024 presidential election, Trump is better positioned to win the White House than at any point in either of his previous campaigns. He leads Joe Biden by slim margins in most polls, including in several of the seven swing states likely to determine the outcome. But I had not come to ask about the election, the disgrace that followed the last one, or how he has become the first former\u2014and perhaps future\u2014American President to face a criminal trial. I wanted to know what Trump would do if he wins a second term, to hear his vision for the nation, in his own words.\n\nPhotograph by Philip Montgomery for TIME\n\nBuy your copy of this issue here\n\nWhat emerged in two interviews with Trump, and conversations with more than a dozen of his closest advisers and confidants, were the outlines of an imperial presidency that would reshape America and its role in the world. To carry out a deportation operation designed to remove more than 11 million people from the country, Trump told me, he would be willing to build migrant detention camps and deploy the U.S. military, both at the border and inland. He would let red states monitor women\u2019s pregnancies and prosecute those who violate abortion bans. He would, at his personal discretion, withhold funds appropriated by Congress, according to top advisers. He would be willing to fire a U.S. Attorney who doesn\u2019t carry out his order to prosecute someone, breaking with a tradition of independent law enforcement that dates from America\u2019s founding. He is weighing pardons for every one of his supporters accused of attacking the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, more than 800 of whom have pleaded guilty or been convicted by a jury. He might not come to the aid of an attacked ally in Europe or Asia if he felt that country wasn\u2019t paying enough for its own defense. He would gut the U.S. civil service, deploy the National Guard to American cities as he sees fit, close the White House pandemic-preparedness office, and staff his Administration with acolytes who back his false assertion that the 2020 election was stolen.\n\nTrump remains the same guy, with the same goals and grievances. But in person, if anything, he appears more assertive and confident. \u201cWhen I first got to Washington, I knew very few people,\u201d he says. \u201cI had to rely on people.\u201d Now he is in charge. The arranged marriage with the timorous Republican Party stalwarts is over; the old guard is vanquished, and the people who remain are his people. Trump would enter a second term backed by a slew of policy shops staffed by loyalists who have drawn up detailed plans in service of his agenda, which would concentrate the powers of the state in the hands of a man whose appetite for power appears all but insatiable. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big mystery what his agenda would be,\u201d says his close adviser Kellyanne Conway. \u201cBut I think people will be surprised at the alacrity with which he will take action.\u201d\n\nThe crowd at a Trump campaign rally in Schnecksville, Penn., on April 13. Victor J. Blue for TIME\n\nThe courts, the Constitution, and a Congress of unknown composition would all have a say in whether Trump\u2019s objectives come to pass. The machinery of Washington has a range of defenses: leaks to a free press, whistle-blower protections, the oversight of inspectors general. The same deficiencies of temperament and judgment that hindered him in the past remain present. If he wins, Trump would be a lame duck\u2014contrary to the suggestions of some supporters, he tells TIME he would not seek to overturn or ignore the Constitution\u2019s prohibition on a third term. Public opinion would also be a powerful check. Amid a popular outcry, Trump was forced to scale back some of his most draconian first-term initiatives, including the policy of separating migrant families. As George Orwell wrote in 1945, the ability of governments to carry out their designs \u201cdepends on the general temper in the country.\u201d\n\nEvery election is billed as a national turning point. This time that rings true. To supporters, the prospect of Trump 2.0, unconstrained and backed by a disciplined movement of true believers, offers revolutionary promise. To much of the rest of the nation and the world, it represents an alarming risk. A second Trump term could bring \u201cthe end of our democracy,\u201d says presidential historian Douglas Brinkley, \u201cand the birth of a new kind of authoritarian presidential order.\u201d\n\nTrump steps onto the patio at Mar-a-Lago near dusk. The well-heeled crowd eating Wagyu steaks and grilled branzino pauses to applaud as he takes his seat. On this gorgeous evening, the club is a MAGA mecca. Billionaire donor Steve Wynn is here. So is Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, who is dining with the former President after a joint press conference proposing legislation to prevent noncitizens from voting. Their voting in federal elections is already illegal, and extremely rare, but remains a Trumpian fixation that the embattled Speaker appeared happy to co-sign in exchange for the political cover that standing with Trump provides.\n\nAt the moment, though, Trump\u2019s attention is elsewhere. With an index finger, he swipes through an iPad on the table to curate the restaurant\u2019s soundtrack. The playlist veers from Sinead O\u2019Connor to James Brown to The Phantom of the Opera. And there\u2019s a uniquely Trump choice: a rendition of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d sung by a choir of defendants imprisoned for attacking the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, interspersed with a recording of Trump reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. This has become a staple of his rallies, converting the ultimate symbol of national unity into a weapon of factional devotion.\n\nThe spectacle picks up where his first term left off. The events of Jan. 6, during which a pro-Trump mob attacked the center of American democracy in an effort to subvert the peaceful transfer of power, was a profound stain on his legacy. Trump has sought to recast an insurrectionist riot as an act of patriotism. \u201cI call them the J-6 patriots,\u201d he says. When I ask whether he would consider pardoning every one of them, he says, \u201cYes, absolutely.\u201d As Trump faces dozens of felony charges, including for election interference, conspiracy to defraud the United States, willful retention of national-security secrets, and falsifying business records to conceal hush-money payments, he has tried to turn legal peril into a badge of honor.\n\nThe Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol is a profound stain on Trump\u2019s legacy, one that he has sought to recast as an act of patriotism. Victor J. Blue\n\nIn a second term, Trump\u2019s influence on American democracy would extend far beyond pardoning powers. Allies are laying the groundwork to restructure the presidency in line with a doctrine called the unitary executive theory, which holds that many of the constraints imposed on the White House by legislators and the courts should be swept away in favor of a more powerful Commander in Chief.\n\nRead More: Fact-Checking What Donald Trump Said In His Interviews With TIME\n\nNowhere would that power be more momentous than at the Department of Justice. Since the nation\u2019s earliest days, Presidents have generally kept a respectful distance from Senate-confirmed law-enforcement officials to avoid exploiting for personal ends their enormous ability to curtail Americans\u2019 freedoms. But Trump, burned in his first term by multiple investigations directed by his own appointees, is ever more vocal about imposing his will directly on the department and its far-flung investigators and prosecutors.\n\nIn our Mar-a-Lago interview, Trump says he might fire U.S. Attorneys who refuse his orders to prosecute someone: \u201cIt would depend on the situation.\u201d He\u2019s told supporters he would seek retribution against his enemies in a second term. Would that include Fani Willis, the Atlanta-area district attorney who charged him with election interference, or Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan DA in the Stormy Daniels case, who Trump has previously said should be prosecuted? Trump demurs but offers no promises. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d he says, before adding, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna look at a lot of things. What they\u2019ve done is a terrible thing.\u201d\n\nTrump has also vowed to appoint a \u201creal special prosecutor\u201d to go after Biden. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to hurt Biden,\u201d he tells me. \u201cI have too much respect for the office.\u201d Seconds later, though, he suggests Biden\u2019s fate may be tied to an upcoming Supreme Court ruling on whether Presidents can face criminal prosecution for acts committed in office. \u201cIf they said that a President doesn\u2019t get immunity,\u201d says Trump, \u201cthen Biden, I am sure, will be prosecuted for all of his crimes.\u201d (Biden has not been charged with any, and a House Republican effort to impeach him has failed to unearth evidence of any crimes or misdemeanors, high or low.)\n\nRead More: Trump Says \u2018Anti-White Feeling\u2019 Is a Problem in the U.S.\n\nSuch moves would be potentially catastrophic for the credibility of American law enforcement, scholars and former Justice Department leaders from both parties say. \u201cIf he ordered an improper prosecution, I would expect any respectable U.S. Attorney to say no,\u201d says Michael McConnell, a former U.S. appellate judge appointed by President George W. Bush. \u201cIf the President fired the U.S. Attorney, it would be an enormous firestorm.\u201d McConnell, now a Stanford law professor, says the dismissal could have a cascading effect similar to the Saturday Night Massacre, when President Richard Nixon ordered top DOJ officials to remove the special counsel investigating Watergate. Presidents have the constitutional right to fire U.S. Attorneys, and typically replace their predecessors\u2019 appointees upon taking office. But discharging one specifically for refusing a President\u2019s order would be all but unprecedented.\n\nThe U.S. border fence in Sunland Park, N.M.. Victor J. Blue\n\nTrump\u2019s radical designs for presidential power would be felt throughout the country. A main focus is the southern border. Trump says he plans to sign orders to reinstall many of the same policies from his first term, such as the Remain in Mexico program, which requires that non-Mexican asylum seekers be sent south of the border until their court dates, and Title 42, which allows border officials to expel migrants without letting them apply for asylum. Advisers say he plans to cite record border crossings and fentanyl- and child-trafficking as justification for reimposing the emergency measures. He would direct federal funding to resume construction of the border wall, likely by allocating money from the military budget without congressional approval. The capstone of this program, advisers say, would be a massive deportation operation that would target millions of people. Trump made similar pledges in his first term, but says he plans to be more aggressive in a second. \u201cPeople need to be deported,\u201d says Tom Homan, a top Trump adviser and former acting head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. \u201cNo one should be off the table.\u201d\n\nRead More: The Story Behind TIME's 'If He Wins' Trump Cover\n\nFor an operation of that scale, Trump says he would rely mostly on the National Guard to round up and remove undocumented migrants throughout the country. \u201cIf they weren\u2019t able to, then I\u2019d use [other parts of] the military,\u201d he says. When I ask if that means he would override the Posse Comitatus Act\u2014an 1878 law that prohibits the use of military force on civilians\u2014Trump seems unmoved by the weight of the statute. \u201cWell, these aren\u2019t civilians,\u201d he says. \u201cThese are people that aren\u2019t legally in our country.\u201d He would also seek help from local police and says he would deny funding for jurisdictions that decline to adopt his policies. \u201cThere\u2019s a possibility that some won\u2019t want to participate,\u201d Trump says, \u201cand they won\u2019t partake in the riches.\u201d\n\nAs President, Trump nominated three Supreme Court Justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade, and he claims credit for his role in ending a constitutional right to an abortion. At the same time, he has sought to defuse a potent campaign issue for the Democrats by saying he wouldn\u2019t sign a federal ban. In our interview at Mar-a-Lago, he declines to commit to vetoing any additional federal restrictions if they came to his desk. More than 20 states now have full or partial abortion bans, and Trump says those policies should be left to the states to do what they want, including monitoring women\u2019s pregnancies. \u201cI think they might do that,\u201d he says. When I ask whether he would be comfortable with states prosecuting women for having abortions beyond the point the laws permit, he says, \u201cIt\u2019s irrelevant whether I\u2019m comfortable or not. It\u2019s totally irrelevant, because the states are going to make those decisions.\u201d President Biden has said he would fight state anti-abortion measures in court and with regulation.\n\nTrump\u2019s allies don\u2019t plan to be passive on abortion if he returns to power. The Heritage Foundation has called for enforcement of a 19th century statute that would outlaw the mailing of abortion pills. The Republican Study Committee (RSC), which includes more than 80% of the House GOP conference, included in its 2025 budget proposal the Life at Conception Act, which says the right to life extends to \u201cthe moment of fertilization.\u201d I ask Trump if he would veto that bill if it came to his desk. \u201cI don\u2019t have to do anything about vetoes,\u201d Trump says, \u201cbecause we now have it back in the states.\u201d\n\nPresidents typically have a narrow window to pass major legislation. Trump\u2019s team is eyeing two bills to kick off a second term: a border-security and immigration package, and an extension of his 2017 tax cuts. Many of the latter\u2019s provisions expire early in 2025: the tax cuts on individual income brackets, 100% business expensing, the doubling of the estate-tax deduction. Trump is planning to intensify his protectionist agenda, telling me he\u2019s considering a tariff of more than 10% on all imports, and perhaps even a 100% tariff on some Chinese goods. Trump says the tariffs will liberate the U.S. economy from being at the mercy of foreign manufacturing and spur an industrial renaissance in the U.S. When I point out that independent analysts estimate Trump\u2019s first term tariffs on thousands of products, including steel and aluminum, solar panels, and washing machines, may have cost the U.S. $316 billion and more than 300,000 jobs, by one account, he dismisses these experts out of hand. His advisers argue that the average yearly inflation rate in his first term\u2014under 2%\u2014is evidence that his tariffs won\u2019t raise prices.\n\nSince leaving office, Trump has tried to engineer a caucus of the compliant, clearing primary fields in Senate and House races. His hope is that GOP majorities replete with MAGA diehards could rubber-stamp his legislative agenda and nominees. Representative Jim Banks of Indiana, a former RSC chairman and the GOP nominee for the state\u2019s open Senate seat, recalls an August 2022 RSC planning meeting with Trump at his residence in Bedminster, N.J. As the group arrived, Banks recalls, news broke that Mar-a-Lago had been raided by the FBI. Banks was sure the meeting would be canceled. Moments later, Trump walked through the doors, defiant and pledging to run again. \u201cI need allies there when I\u2019m elected,\u201d Banks recalls Trump saying. The difference in a second Trump term, Banks says now, \u201cis he\u2019s going to have the backup in Congress that he didn\u2019t have before.\u201d\n\nHaley, Scavino, Wiles: AP (3); Bannon, Conway, Homan, LaCivita, Lighthizer, J. Miller, S. Miller, Trump, Vought: Getty Images (9)\n\nTrump\u2019s intention to remake America\u2019s relations abroad may be just as consequential. Since its founding, the U.S. has sought to build and sustain alliances based on the shared values of political and economic freedom. Trump takes a much more transactional approach to international relations than his predecessors, expressing disdain for what he views as free-riding friends and appreciation for authoritarian leaders like President Xi Jinping of China, Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary, or former President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil.\n\nThat\u2019s one reason America\u2019s traditional allies were horrified when Trump recently said at a campaign rally that Russia could \u201cdo whatever the hell they want\u201d to a NATO country he believes doesn\u2019t spend enough on collective defense. That wasn\u2019t idle bluster, Trump tells me. \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to pay, then you\u2019re on your own,\u201d he says. Trump has long said the alliance is ripping the U.S. off. Former NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg credited Trump\u2019s first-term threat to pull out of the alliance with spurring other members to add more than $100 billion to their defense budgets.\n\nBut an insecure NATO is as likely to accrue to Russia\u2019s benefit as it is to America\u2019s. President Vladimir Putin\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine looks to many in Europe and the U.S. like a test of his broader vision to reconstruct the Soviet empire. Under Biden and a bipartisan Congress, the U.S. has sent more than $100 billion to Ukraine to defend itself. It\u2019s unlikely Trump would extend the same support to Kyiv. After Orban visited Mar-a-Lago in March, he said Trump \u201cwouldn\u2019t give a penny\u201d to Ukraine. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t give unless Europe starts equalizing,\u201d Trump hedges in our interview. \u201cIf Europe is not going to pay, why should we pay? They\u2019re much more greatly affected. We have an ocean in between us. They don\u2019t.\u201d (E.U. nations have given more than $100 billion in aid to Ukraine as well.)\n\nRead More: Read the Full Transcripts of Donald Trump's Interviews With TIME\n\nTrump has historically been reluctant to criticize or confront Putin. He sided with the Russian autocrat over his own intelligence community when it asserted that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. Even now, Trump uses Putin as a foil for his own political purposes. When I asked Trump why he has not called for the release of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who has been unjustly held on spurious charges in a Moscow prison for a year, Trump says, \u201cI guess because I have so many other things I\u2019m working on.\u201d Gershkovich should be freed, he adds, but he doubts it will happen before the election. \u201cThe reporter should be released and he will be released,\u201d Trump tells me. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019s going to be released under Biden. I would get him released.\u201d\n\nAmerica\u2019s Asian allies, like its European ones, may be on their own under Trump. Taiwan\u2019s Foreign Minister recently said aid to Ukraine was critical in deterring Xi from invading the island. Communist China\u2019s leaders \u201chave to understand that things like that can\u2019t come easy,\u201d Trump says, but he declines to say whether he would come to Taiwan\u2019s defense.\n\nTrump is less cryptic on current U.S. troop deployments in Asia. If South Korea doesn\u2019t pay more to support U.S. troops there to deter Kim Jong Un\u2019s increasingly belligerent regime to the north, Trump suggests the U.S. could withdraw its forces. \u201cWe have 40,000 troops that are in a precarious position,\u201d he tells TIME. (The number is actually 28,500.) \u201cWhich doesn\u2019t make any sense. Why would we defend somebody? And we\u2019re talking about a very wealthy country.\u201d\n\nTransactional isolationism may be the main strain of Trump\u2019s foreign policy, but there are limits. Trump says he would join Israel\u2019s side in a confrontation with Iran. \u201cIf they attack Israel, yes, we would be there,\u201d he tells me. He says he has come around to the now widespread belief in Israel that a Palestinian state existing side by side in peace is increasingly unlikely. \u201cThere was a time when I thought two-state could work,\u201d he says. \u201cNow I think two-state is going to be very, very tough.\u201d\n\nYet even his support for Israel is not absolute. He\u2019s criticized Israel\u2019s handling of its war against Hamas, which has killed more than 30,000 Palestinians in Gaza, and has called for the nation to \u201cget it over with.\u201d When I ask whether he would consider withholding U.S. military aid to Israel to push it toward winding down the war, he doesn\u2019t say yes, but he doesn\u2019t rule it out, either. He is sharply critical of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, once a close ally. \u201cI had a bad experience with Bibi,\u201d Trump says. In his telling, a January 2020 U.S. operation to assassinate a top Iranian general was supposed to be a joint attack until Netanyahu backed out at the last moment. \u201cThat was something I never forgot,\u201d he says. He blames Netanyahu for failing to prevent the Oct. 7 attack, when Hamas militants infiltrated southern Israel and killed nearly 1,200 people amid acts of brutality including burning entire families alive and raping women and girls. \u201cIt happened on his watch,\u201d Trump says.\n\nOn the second day of Trump\u2019s New York trial on April 17, I stand behind the packed counter of the Sanaa Convenience Store on 139th Street and Broadway, waiting for Trump to drop in for a postcourt campaign stop. He chose the bodega for its history. In 2022, one of the store\u2019s clerks fatally stabbed a customer who attacked him. Bragg, the Manhattan DA, charged the clerk with second-degree murder. (The charges were later dropped amid public outrage over video footage that appeared to show the clerk acting in self-defense.) A baseball bat behind the counter alludes to lingering security concerns. When Trump arrives, he asks the store\u2019s co-owner, Maad Ahmed, a Yemeni immigrant, about safety. \u201cYou should be allowed to have a gun,\u201d Trump tells Ahmed. \u201cIf you had a gun, you\u2019d never get robbed.\u201d\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump uses crime as a cudgel, painting urban America as a savage hell-scape even though violent crime has declined in recent years, with homicides sinking 6% in 2022 and 13% in 2023, according to the FBI. When I point this out, Trump tells me he thinks the data, which is collected by state and local police departments, is rigged. \u201cIt\u2019s a lie,\u201d he says. He has pledged to send the National Guard into cities struggling with crime in a second term\u2014possibly without the request of governors\u2014and plans to approve Justice Department grants only to cities that adopt his preferred policing methods like stop-and-frisk.\n\nTo critics, Trump\u2019s preoccupation with crime is a racial dog whistle. In polls, large numbers of his supporters have expressed the view that antiwhite racism now represents a greater problem in the U.S. than the systemic racism that has long afflicted Black Americans. When I ask if he agrees, Trump does not dispute this position. \u201cThere is a definite antiwhite feeling in the country,\u201d he tells TIME, \u201cand that can\u2019t be allowed either.\u201d In a second term, advisers say, a Trump Administration would rescind Biden\u2019s Executive Orders designed to boost diversity and racial equity.\n\nA protester confronts members of the Minnesota National Guard after the murder of George Floyd. Victor J. Blue\n\nTrump\u2019s ability to campaign for the White House in the midst of an unprecedented criminal trial is the product of a more professional campaign operation that has avoided the infighting that plagued past versions. \u201cHe has a very disciplined team around him,\u201d says Representative Elise Stefanik of New York. \u201cThat is an indicator of how disciplined and focused a second term will be.\u201d That control now extends to the party writ large. In 2016, the GOP establishment, having failed to derail Trump\u2019s campaign, surrounded him with staff who sought to temper him. Today the party\u2019s permanent class have either devoted themselves to the gospel of MAGA or given up. Trump has cleaned house at the Republican National Committee, installing handpicked leaders\u2014including his daughter-in-law\u2014who have reportedly imposed loyalty tests on prospective job applicants, asking whether they believe the false assertion that the 2020 election was stolen. (The RNC has denied there is a litmus test.) Trump tells me he would have trouble hiring anyone who admits Biden won: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t feel good about it.\u201d\n\nPolicy groups are creating a government-in-waiting full of true believers. The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Project 2025 has drawn up plans for legislation and Executive Orders as it trains prospective personnel for a second Trump term. The Center for Renewing America, led by Russell Vought, Trump\u2019s former director of the Office of Management and Budget, is dedicated to disempowering the so-called administrative state, the collection of bureaucrats with the power to control everything from drug-safety determinations to the contents of school lunches. The America First Policy Institute is a research haven of pro-Trump right-wing populists. America First Legal, led by Trump\u2019s immigration adviser Stephen Miller, is mounting court battles against the Biden Administration.\n\nThe goal of these groups is to put Trump\u2019s vision into action on day one. \u201cThe President never had a policy process that was designed to give him what he actually wanted and campaigned on,\u201d says Vought. \u201c[We are] sorting through the legal authorities, the mechanics, and providing the momentum for a future Administration.\u201d That includes a litany of boundary-pushing right-wing policies, including slashing Department of Justice funding and cutting climate and environmental regulations.\n\nRead More: Fact-Checking What Donald Trump Said in His 2024 Interviews With TIME\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign says he would be the final decision-maker on which policies suggested by these organizations would get implemented. But at the least, these advisers could form the front lines of a planned march against what Trump dubs the Deep State, marrying bureaucratic savvy to their leader\u2019s anti-bureaucratic zeal. One weapon in Trump\u2019s second-term \u201cWar on Washington\u201d is a wonky one: restoring the power of impoundment, which allowed Presidents to withhold congressionally appropriated funds. Impoundment was a favorite maneuver of Nixon, who used his authority to freeze funding for subsidized housing and the Environmental Protection Agency. Trump and his allies plan to challenge a 1974 law that prohibits use of the measure, according to campaign policy advisers.\n\nAnother inside move is the enforcement of Schedule F, which allows the President to fire nonpolitical government officials and which Trump says he would embrace. \u201cYou have some people that are protected that shouldn\u2019t be protected,\u201d he says. A senior U.S. judge offers an example of how consequential such a move could be. Suppose there\u2019s another pandemic, and President Trump wants to push the use of an untested drug, much as he did with hydroxychloroquine during COVID-19. Under Schedule F, if the drug\u2019s medical reviewer at the Food and Drug Administration refuses to sign off on its use, Trump could fire them, and anyone else who doesn\u2019t approve it. The Trump team says the President needs the power to hold bureaucrats accountable to voters. \u201cThe mere mention of Schedule F,\u201d says Vought, \u201censures that the bureaucracy moves in your direction.\u201d\n\nIt can be hard at times to discern Trump\u2019s true intentions. In his interviews with TIME, he often sidestepped questions or answered them in contradictory ways. There\u2019s no telling how his ego and self-destructive behavior might hinder his objectives. And for all his norm-breaking, there are lines he says he won\u2019t cross. When asked if he would comply with all orders upheld by the Supreme Court, Trump says he would.\n\nBut his policy preoccupations are clear and consistent. If Trump is able to carry out a fraction of his goals, the impact could prove as transformative as any presidency in more than a century. \u201cHe\u2019s in full war mode,\u201d says his former adviser and occasional confidant Stephen Bannon. Trump\u2019s sense of the state of the country is \u201cquite apocalyptic,\u201d Bannon says. \u201cThat\u2019s where Trump\u2019s heart is. That\u2019s where his obsession is.\u201d\n\nTrump speaks at his last rally ahead of his criminal trial in Schnecksville, Penn., on April 13. Victor J. Blue for TIME\n\nThese obsessions could once again push the nation to the brink of crisis. Trump does not dismiss the possibility of political violence around the election. \u201cIf we don\u2019t win, you know, it depends,\u201d he tells TIME. \u201cIt always depends on the fairness of the election.\u201d When I ask what he meant when he baselessly claimed on Truth Social that a stolen election \u201callows for the termination of all rules, regulations and articles, even those found in the Constitution,\u201d Trump responded by denying he had said it. He then complained about the \u201cBiden-inspired\u201d court case he faces in New York and suggested that the \u201cfascists\u201d in America\u2019s government were its greatest threat. \u201cI think the enemy from within, in many cases, is much more dangerous for our country than the outside enemies of China, Russia, and various others,\u201d he tells me.\n\nToward the end of our conversation at Mar-a-Lago, I ask Trump to explain another troubling comment he made: that he wants to be dictator for a day. It came during a Fox News town hall with Sean Hannity, who gave Trump an opportunity to allay concerns that he would abuse power in office or seek retribution against political opponents. Trump said he would not be a dictator\u2014\u201cexcept for day one,\u201d he added. \u201cI want to close the border, and I want to drill, drill, drill.\u201d\n\nTrump says that the remark \u201cwas said in fun, in jest, sarcastically.\u201d He compares it to an infamous moment from the 2016 campaign, when he encouraged the Russians to hack and leak Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails. In Trump\u2019s mind, the media sensationalized those remarks too. But the Russians weren\u2019t joking: among many other efforts to influence the core exercise of American democracy that year, they hacked the Democratic National Committee\u2019s servers and disseminated its emails through WikiLeaks.\n\nWhether or not he was kidding about bringing a tyrannical end to our 248-year experiment in democracy, I ask him, Don\u2019t you see why many Americans see such talk of dictatorship as contrary to our most cherished principles? Trump says no. Quite the opposite, he insists. \u201cI think a lot of people like it.\u201d \u2014With reporting by Leslie Dickstein, Simmone Shah, and Julia Zorthian",

But he adds a lot would have to go wrong for one candidate to lose.\n\nLichtman uses the prediction system he developed called \"The Keys to the White House\" to determine the outcome of the elections.

The pair adapted models used to predict earthquakes to better understand the American political sphere.\n\nAccording to the American University\u2019s website, the 13 keys are:\n\nParty mandate: After the midterm elections, the incumbent party holds more seats in the US House of Representatives than after the previous midterm elections. Contest: There is no serious contest for the incumbent party nomination. Incumbency: The incumbent party candidate is the sitting president. Third-party: There is no significant third-party or independent campaign. Short term economy: The economy is not in recession during the election campaign. Long-term economy: Real per capita economic growth during the term equals or exceeds mean growth during the previous two terms. Policy change: The incumbent administration affects major changes in national policy. Social unrest: There is no sustained social unrest during the term. Scandal: The incumbent administration is untainted by major scandal. Foreign/military failure: The incumbent administration suffers no major failure in foreign or military affairs. Foreign/military success: The incumbent administration achieves a major success in foreign or military affairs. Incumbent charisma: The incumbent party candidate is charismatic or a national hero.

        "text": "Presidential debate commission sticks to schedule despite Trump's urging\nThe first general election debate is still set to take place on Sept. 16.\n\nThe Commission on Presidential Debates is pushing back against suggestions from the Trump campaign that it move its general debate calendar up -- standing firm in its decision to hold the first broadcast on Sept. 16, 2024.\n\nIn a statement released on Wednesday, a day after Trump senior campaign advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles released their own statement urging earlier debates, the commission correctly noted that its September event is the earliest it's ever conducted a debate. The previous record was set in 1980, when Republican Ronald Reagan and Independent John Anderson went head-to-head on Sept. 21.\n\nTrump senior advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles on Wednesday evening made an additional statement on the commission saying its general debate schedule will remain unchanged this cycle.\n\nThe Trump advisers reiterated the campaign's willingness to work directly with the Biden campaign in organizing earlier debates, calling on \"every television network\" to host them \"with or without the stubborn Presidential Debates Commission.\"\n\nThe commission noted that, \"as it always does, the CPD considered multiple factors in selecting debate dates in order to make them accessible by the American public,\" including religious and federal holidays, early voting, and the dates on which individual states close their ballots.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and Former President Donald Trump Getty Images\n\nThe commission also pushed back against the Trump advisers' claims that \"millions of Americans will have already cast their ballots\" at the time of the first debate, noting that it \"purposefully chose September 16 after a comprehensive study of early voting rules in every state,\" including taking into consideration North Carolina's Sept. 6 start to sending out mail-in ballots.\n\nOn Sept. 16, the day of the first debate, Pennsylvania voters can receive, complete and return ballots at their county boards of elections, CPD notes. Minnesota is one of the first states to offer in-person early voting, and voters there can begin to cast ballots on Friday, Sept. 20.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and Former President Donald Trump Getty Images\n\n\"The CPD has only one mission: to sponsor and produce general election debates that inform and educate the public. Our schedule is designed with that single mission in mind. The colleges and universities preparing to host these debates look forward to being part of an historic 2024 series of forums,\" the commission continued in its statement.\n\nFollowing the first debate on Sep. 16 at Texas State University, the commission has announced plans to hold the second on Oct. 1 at Virginia State University and the third on Oct. 9 at The University of Utah in Salt Lake City. It plans to hold a vice presidential debate on Sept. 25 at Lafayette College in Pennsylvania.\n\nLast week, President Joe Biden told Howard Stern on his Sirius XM show that he would be \"happy\" to debate former President Donald Trump, although he did not specify when. Trump and his campaign have used the moment to reemphasize their calls for earlier debates.\n\nAt rallies, before Trump speaks, the campaign directs supporters to turn their attention to the stage, where a second podium has been placed with a banner on it that says \"Anytime. Anywhere. Anyplace,\" in reference to a previous statement from Trump regarding his willingness to face off against Biden.\n\nTrump has previously attacked the commission, when in 2020 he claimed he would not accept any of their changes intended to enforce the rules and limit interruptions at the remaining 2020 presidential debates.",

        "text": "President Biden trails former President Trump. Can he come back?\nSections Print\n\nIn 2020, Joe Biden beat incumbent Donald Trump by 4.5 percentage points in the national popular vote but by a much narrower margin in the Electoral College.1 Will history repeat itself, or will Trump accomplish a feat seen only once before in American history\u2014returning to the White House by defeating the man who turned him out of office in the previous election? The national situation Although polls do not reliably predict the outcome of elections far in the future, they do provide insight into the dynamics of these contests. They are more like X-rays than snapshots, helping us probe beneath the surface to assess trends in different parts of the electorate. Here\u2019s what they are telling us now: As of this week, President Biden trails former President Trump by about 1.5 percentage points in the average of national polls, which puts him roughly six points behind where he was on Election Day in 2020. A comparison of two Pew Research Center surveys\u2014one analyzing the 2020 vote, the other conducted in April 2024\u2014helps us understand where Biden has lost the most ground.\n\nA comparison between these surveys indicates that the distribution of the white vote has remained fairly stable, in the aggregate and between those with and without college degrees. By contrast, major shifts away from Biden have occurred among Black, Hispanic, and Asian voters. Surprisingly, Trump appears to have gained more ground among college-educated Black and Hispanic voters than with less educated members of these groups. Equally surprising: Up to now, Trump has increased his support more among women than men. Whether this trend will survive a Democratic campaign heavily focused on abortion remains to be seen. Also significant is the erosion of support for Biden among voters ages 30 to 49. This is the cohort most focused on family formation and most likely to become first-time homeowners, suggesting that the surging costs of child care and monthly mortgage payments may be reducing their support for the president. Every recent survey shows that the state of the economy is the top issue for voters, followed by immigration. This emphasis usually reflects concerns about high unemployment, recessions, or slow growth. But as a recent survey shows, this year is different.\n\nThis finding helps explain why President Biden has received consistently low marks for his handling of the economy despite better-than-expected growth, vigorous job creation, unemployment below four percent and major new long-term investments in key economic sectors. It is consistent, moreover, with other surveys showing Americans more focused on price levels rather than the rate of price increases. The declining rate of inflation (disinflation) does nothing to lower the cost of food, gasoline, electricity, and housing. Americans are yearning for price decreases (deflation), which are unlikely to occur without a significant recession. The situation in the swing states Ever since the Constitution was ratified, national elections have been decided in the Electoral College. In recent decades, however, a new pattern has emerged: Fewer and fewer states are closely contested between the parties, while more and more are dominated by one of the parties. By 2020, only seven states were truly up for grabs, and Biden won six of them. As of now, however, he trails Trump in all seven (Table 2).\n\nThis table reveals several patterns that may affect the strategies of the presidential campaigns over the next six months. First, President Biden has less ground to make up in the \u201cBlue Wall\u201d states (Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania) than he does in the South and Southwest. As we will see, high levels of concern about immigration may be damaging his prospects in Arizona and Nevada, while economic discontent seems to be inflicting higher-than-average damage on his standing in Georgia. Second, despite carrying Michigan by the highest margin among the swing states he won in 2020, the president has lost more ground there than in the other Blue Wall states. This is crucial: If he ends up carrying these states, he probably will eke out a paper-thin margin of 270 to 268 in the Electoral College.2 But if he loses in Michigan, he will be forced to win one of the southern states (Georgia or North Carolina) or both the southwestern states (Arizona and Nevada), in all of which he currently has a steeper hill to climb than in Michigan. A recent Bloomberg/Morning Consult survey of the swing states produced more than 5,000 pages of detailed data. Among the highlights: For these states in the aggregate, about half the voters selected either the economy or immigration as their top issue, compared to fewer than one in five who chose abortion or threats to democracy. By wide margins, Trump is more trusted to deal with the economy and immigration; by narrower margins, Biden is more trusted on abortion and democracy.\n\nData from individual states show higher concern about immigration in Arizona and Nevada, where 23% and 21% of the voters, respectively, chose it as their top issue. The other outlier was Georgia, where 41% selected the economy as their top concern. Probing concerns about the economy in more depth, the Bloomberg/Morning Consult poll offered respondents a list of 15 factors than might be influencing their votes and asked them to choose their top three. Although the options ranged from traditional Democratic issues such as jobs, unemployment, and wages to traditional Republican issues such as taxes, government spending, and balanced budget, the top five named by the voters all addressed prices and costs.\n\nWhile Trump leads on four of five top economic concerns, Biden has made an effective case for his efforts to contain health care costs by focusing on specifics such as insulin and prescription drugs. His challenge is to find equally compelling specifics in other economic arenas and to persuade voters that these efforts are making a difference in their lives. Regarding Biden\u2019s effort to turn around voter sentiment on the economy, the survey makes two key points. First, Biden cannot prevail by distinguishing between the national economy and conditions closer to home. Asked to compare the state of the economy under Biden and his predecessor, 36% said that the national economy is better under Biden, versus 52% who said it was better under Trump. But the results were similar for \u201cyour state\u201d (35% to 49%), \u201cyour city or town\u201d (34% to 48%), and \u201cyour personal situation\u201d (32% to 51%). These results provide evidence against the hypothesis that negative media coverage is depressing the public\u2019s assessment of the economy. Whatever may be the case at the national level, voters can see for themselves what is happening in their localities and personal lives. Second, Biden cannot accomplish his mission by holding others responsible for the state of the economy. Although others play their part (especially Congress and corporations), by a substantial margin, more voters see the president as \u201cvery responsible\u201d for economic conditions than any other institution. This should come as no surprise\u2014since the late 1920s, presidents have been held responsible for the economy, and there is no reason to suppose that 2024 will be any different. The impact of third party and independent candidacies In 2016, independent and third-party candidates received six percent of the national popular vote, preventing Hillary Clinton from consolidating the anti-Trump forces behind her candidacy. She received only 48% of the vote, allowing Trump to win in the Electoral College with only 46%. In 2020, by contrast, third party and independent candidates garnered less than two percent of the vote, allowing Joe Biden to unify the opposition to Trump and win with an outright majority of more than 51%. Will 2024 be more like 2016 or 2020, or will it be something altogether different? As of now, the evidence points to the third option. On the one hand, widespread discontent with both major-party candidates has opened a space for several alternatives, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is receiving double-digit support in the polls. Even if his support shrinks as the general election approaches, the odds are that non-major party candidates will receive a much higher share of the popular vote than they did four years ago. On the other hand, current polls suggest that the net effect of these candidacies may be close to zero. At the national level, a comparison of recent surveys that assessed both the head-to-head Trump-Biden race and the five-way race including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Green Party candidate Jill Stein, and independent Cornel West shows no significant differences: Trump leads Biden by 0.4% in the two-way race but trails him by 0.2% in the five-way contest. This makes intuitive sense. As left-leaning candidates, Stein and West are more likely to draw from Biden, while fragmentary evidence suggests that Kennedy is drawing more from Trump. For example, the Quinnipiac survey conducted April 18 to April 24 found that RFK Jr. drew support from 12% of voters who supported Trump in a two-way contest, compared to seven percent from Biden supporters. By contrast, Stein and West together attracted six percent of Biden supporters versus just one percent from Trump. Combined, the three independent candidates drew 13% from each from each of the major party candidates. Similarly, an NBC survey fielded between April 12 and April 16 found that RFK Jr. attracted 15% of Trump voters compared to seven percent of Biden voters, while Stein and West voters came mostly from Biden supporters. The net effect of these candidacies could change if Kennedy\u2019s support wanes, however. Much the same pattern prevails in the swing states, as a comparison of two-way and five-way races from a recent survey shows.",

        "text": "Immigration Named Top U.S. Problem for Third Straight Month\nWASHINGTON, D.C. -- A steady 27% of Americans say the most important problem facing the U.S. is immigration, topping Gallup\u2019s open-ended trend for the third consecutive month, the longest stretch for this particular issue in the past 24 years.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nThe latest results are based on an April 1-22 Gallup survey, as elevated numbers of migrants continued to seek entry at the U.S. southern border. Immigration tied with the government as the top issue in December 2023, when the number of migrant encounters at the southern border set a record for a single month. In February, as a bipartisan measure to address the issue failed in the U.S. Senate, immigration overtook the government as the nation\u2019s most important problem and has remained there since.\n\nIn addition to these recent instances, immigration has topped Gallup\u2019s most important problem list four times since 2000 (either alone or tied with another issue), including at several points in 2014, 2018 and 2019. However, 2024 is the first time that immigration has remained the top issue for multiple successive months.\n\nOther issues -- including the economy in general, the government, the Iraq War, inflation, COVID-19, unemployment and terrorism -- have held the top spot more often than immigration since Gallup began updating the most important problem question monthly in March 2001. Except for inflation and unemployment, all of the other issues have had longer consecutive runs as the top issue than immigration currently has.\n\nThe economy has been the top problem far more often than any other issue (101 times over the past 24 years), while the government has held the top spot 85 times and the Iraq War registered 50 top appearances.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nImmigration Is Most Politically Polarizing Issue on Most Important Problem List\n\nRepublicans are far more likely than Democrats and independents to name immigration as the most important issue. In the latest poll, 48% of Republicans, compared with 8% of Democrats, mention immigration. Independents fall roughly in the middle, at 25%.\n\nRepublicans\u2019 mention of the issue has come down from February, when a record-high 57% named it. Fewer Democrats now than in 2019 (when as many as 20% mentioned it) say immigration is the top problem. Meanwhile, independents\u2019 latest mention of immigration is at a new high, although statistically similar readings were recorded in 2019 and in recent months.\n\nThe most important problem question is open-ended, allowing respondents to name up to three issues. Variation in the percentage of total mentions each month, generally ranging between 108% and 168% in the trend since 2000, creates additional possible error in how historical percentages (overall and by subgroup) should be interpreted.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nHistorically, Republicans have been much more likely than Democrats and independents to mention immigration as the biggest problem facing the U.S. The current 40-percentage-point gap in Republicans\u2019 and Democrats\u2019 mentions of immigration is among the largest party differences on record for this measure. It is identical to last month\u2019s gap and second to February\u2019s 47-point partisan difference on the same issue.\n\nExamining Gallup\u2019s most important problem trends by party shows that immigration is currently a uniquely polarizing issue. The gaps between Republicans and Democrats mentioning it this year are greater than for any other issue in the past 25 years.\n\nThe next most polarizing issue was the COVID-19 pandemic, which was named by far more Democrats (43%) than Republicans (8%) in February 2021, resulting in a 35-point gap. The Iraq War, the government and unemployment were also named by more Democrats than Republicans in past surveys, showing 20- to 24-point gaps. Terrorism was an especially Republican-centric concern, with a 20-point gap in September 2004.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nOther problems have been cited by more Americans overall, although there was more agreement among partisans on their importance. For example, during the Great Recession, Democrats\u2019 and Republicans\u2019 mentions of the economy were similarly elevated. Likewise, after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, mentions of terrorism increased among both parties.\n\nBottom Line\n\nFor the third month in a row, immigration is the problem Americans name more than any other as the most important facing the U.S. While immigration has not ranked as the top problem often in Gallup\u2019s monthly trend, it stands alone as the most politically polarizing issue in the past 25 years of Gallup\u2019s measurement.\n\nThe record surge of migrants at the southern U.S. border in December brought even more focus on the issue -- and while attempted crossings have eased slightly since then, they are expected to increase as spring continues. President Joe Biden\u2019s approval rating for his handling of immigration has been persistently poor. With the presidential election about six months away and immigration top of mind, the issue remains a significant vulnerability for Biden as he seeks reelection.\n\nTo stay up to date with the latest Gallup News insights and updates, follow us on X.\n\nLearn more about how the Gallup Poll Social Series works.\n\nView complete question responses and trends (PDF download).\n\n###Embeddable###",

        "text": "What Is in the Ukraine Aid Package, and What Does it Mean for the Future of the War?\nAfter months of intense congressional debate, Congress passed and the president signed into law a $61 billion aid package for Ukraine. The legislation gives the president nearly everything he wanted, which is surprising given the drama in the Republican House caucus. The new legislation brings the total U.S. commitment to $175 billion since the beginning of the invasion. It will produce an immediate surge in deliveries of military equipment, which had fallen to about 10 percent of what they had been last year. Because of the delay, another funding package will not be needed until January. That pushes it past the presidential campaign. Despite all this good news, a cloud hangs on the horizon: How does Ukraine plan on winning this war?\n\nQ1: What is included in the package?\n\nA1: The $61 billion of the Ukraine Security Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2024 falls into six categories.\n\nMilitary equipment for Ukraine ($25.7 billion) comprises the largest part of the funding and does three things. First, it replaces equipment that has been or will be sent to Ukraine through presidential drawdown authority (PDA) ($13.4 billion). This authority allows the president to take weapons and munitions from U.S. stockpiles and send them to Ukraine. Although there is no statutory requirement to replace the equipment, Congress has provided funding to do so. If it had not, the resulting shortfalls would have badly hurt U.S. readiness.\n\nSecond, it provides Ukraine with funding through the State Department\u2019s Foreign Military Financing (FMF) program ($1.6 billion). This program provides grants and loans for allies and partners such as Ukraine to purchase weapons and munitions in the United States.\n\nThe third and final element is enhancing the defense industrial base to increase production capabilities and develop more advanced weapons and munitions ($7.0 billion). For example, the bill includes funding to help the U.S. Army meet its monthly production goal of 100,000 155-millimeter (mm) shells by 2025. The United States currently produces around 40,000 shells per month, whereas Ukraine needs at least 100,000 shells per month and up to 180,000 for offensive operations.\n\nA curious element is that the legislation requests $13.4 billion to replenish stockpiles but only $7.8 billion of new drawdown authority. This discrepancy implies a preexisting deficit, likely stemming from accounting changes made last summer. The accounting changes priced equipment at the depreciated value rather than the replacement value. This meant that the Department of Defense (DOD) could send more equipment within an existing authorization level but would need more funding to replace it since the replacements would be purchased at the cost of new equipment.\n\nUkraine-related military activities ($17 billion) funds the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) ($13.8 billion) and U.S. intelligence operations ($3.3 billion). USAI provides funds for three things: training that Ukraine might need for new weapons, individuals, or units; the United States buying arms on the global market, which it has done extensively in the past to acquire Soviet-standard equipment that Ukrainian forces are accustomed to using; and Ukraine purchasing weapons and equipment directly from U.S. manufacturers.\n\nEconomic support to Ukraine ($7.9 billion) assists the Ukrainian government in sustaining essential government services, including law enforcement. This support is structured as a loan, not a grant (section 508), in response to pressure from Republicans and former president Trump. There are detailed procedures by which the president can forgive the loans, giving the president a lot of authority. Essentially, the president can forgive the loans unless Congress takes specific action to disagree. Describing the procedures for these grants takes up three of the fourteen pages in the bill.\n\nU.S. forces ($7.3 billion) pays for the heightened U.S. force presence in Europe. The United States initially surged 20,000 troops to Europe to reassure European allies. While the surge presence declined to around 10,000, the regular fiscal year 2024 budget does not fully cover the costs of these deployed forces. Funds mostly go to the U.S. Army, which received $4.9 billion for its operations and maintenance.\n\nHumanitarian aid ($2.5 billion) includes $1.6 billion for a special \u201cassistance for Europe, Eurasia, and Central Asia\u201d fund, $300 million for counter-drug activities, and $100 million for demining. About $481 million supports Ukrainian refugees in the United States.\n\nOther U.S. governmental agencies ($335 million) includes $150 million for the Department of Energy\u2019s nonproliferation activities. This has been a long-running effort to safeguard civilian power plants and hedge against nuclear incidents. There is also $98 million for research on medical devices, which is perhaps a worthwhile effort but entirely unrelated to the war in Ukraine.\n\nQ2: How does the final legislation compare with the president\u2019s initial request?\n\nA2: The final bill aligns closely with what the president requested last October, except for humanitarian aid, where there is an apparent reduction of $5.8 billion. However, the Israel supplemental contains $9.2 billion for \u201cInternational Disaster Assistance,\u201d \u201cMigration and Refugee Assistance,\u201d and \u201cInternational Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement.\u201d This covers needs arising from the war in Ukraine and needs in the Middle East, such as for Gaza, as well as general international development.\n\nThe table below compares the president\u2019s October 20 request with the final bill.",

        "text": "News organizations have trust issues as they gear up to cover another election, a poll finds\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Even as many Americans say they learn about the 2024 election campaign from national news outlets, a disquieting poll reveals some serious trust issues.\n\nAbout half of Americans, 53%, say they are extremely or very concerned that news organizations will report inaccuracies or misinformation during the election. Some 42% express worry that news outlets will use generative artificial intelligence to create stories, according to a poll from the American Press Institute and The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\nThe poll found 47% of Americans also expressing serious concern that news outlets would report information that has not been confirmed or verified, and 44% worry that accurate information will be presented in a way that favors one side or another.\n\nHalf of Americans say they get election news always or frequently from national news outlets, a percentage that is higher among older respondents, the poll found.\n\n\u201cThe level of engagement is good,\u201d said Michael Bolden, CEO of the American Press Institute. \u201cThe thing that\u2019s most concerning is that they\u2019re not sure they can actually trust the information.\u201d\n\nYears of suspicion about journalists, much of it sown by politicians, is partly responsible, he said. People are also less familiar with how journalism works. The poll found about half of respondents say they have at least a moderate amount of confidence in the information they receive from either national or local news outlets when it comes to the 2024 elections, though only about 1 in 10 say they have a great deal of confidence.\n\nAP AUDIO: News organizations have trust issues as they gear up to cover another election, a poll finds. AP correspondent Donna Warder reports on a new poll that suggests major trust issues when it comes to the public\u2019s ability to believe the media\u2019s coverage of the 2024 election campaign.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\n\u201cThere may have been a time when people knew a journalist because one lived on their block,\u201d Bolden said. \u201cThe way the industry has been decimated, that\u2019s much less likely.\u201d\n\nSimply putting out the news often isn\u2019t good enough anymore, he said. There\u2019s a growing disconnect between news organizations and communities that the outlets need to address, by helping to let people know what journalists do and how people reporting news are their friends and neighbors, he said.\n\nOutlets should lean into a convenor role, bringing people together for newsworthy events, he said.\n\nAbout half of U.S. adults say they follow the news about presidential elections closely, with older adults being more engaged. About two-thirds of Americans age 60 or older say they keep a close eye on presidential election news, compared wth roughly one-third of those under age 30.\n\nThe same trend is seen with local and state election news. While the poll found that 46% of Americans age 60 or older say they follow news about local and state elections closely, only 16% of people age 18 to 29 said the same thing.\n\n\u201cAs they transition to becoming older people, will they begin to care?\u201d Bolden asked. \u201cIf they don\u2019t begin to care, what will that mean for local and state communities?\u201d\n\nYoung people, those under age 30, are about as likely to get election news from social media or friends or family as they are to get it from national or local news outlets, the poll found. Black and Latino adults are somewhat more likely to express \u201ca great deal\u201d of confidence in the reliability of social media as a source of election news than white Americans are.\n\nThat\u2019s both a warning sign, since there is a lot more misinformation to be found on social media, and an opportunity for traditional outlets to make more of their work available this way, Bolden said.\n\nAbout 6 in 10 Democrats say they get election news from national outlets at least frequently. That\u2019s more than the 48% of Republicans or 34% of independents, according to the poll. Republicans are more likely than Democrats and independents to express concern about inaccurate information or misinformation in news coverage during the upcoming elections. About 6 in 10 Republicans are concerned about this, compared with about half of Democrats.\n\nBesides inaccuracies, many also expressed serious concern about election news that focuses too much on division or controversies or concentrates on who may win or lose \u2014 the horserace aspect of political coverage \u2014 rather than issues or the character of candidates.\n\nMost Americans say that for them to make informed decisions about the 2024 state and local elections, they want national and local news outlets to highlight candidates\u2019 values or their different positions on key social issues. In each case, about three-quarters of U.S. adults say they would like \u201ca lot\u201d or \u201csome\u201d coverage of these topics.\n\n___\n\nThe poll of 2,468 adults was conducted March 21-25, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC\u2019s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of error is plus or minus 2.9 percentage points.\n\n___\n\nDavid Bauder writes about media for The Associated Press. Follow him at http://twitter.com/dbauder.",

        "text": "Trump may get another chance to be president. He's planning an aggressive second term\nTrump may get another chance to be president. He's planning an aggressive second term\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Wilfredo Lee/AP Wilfredo Lee/AP\n\nDonald Trump has already been president once, and has been outspoken about the policies he would support and enact if elected again in November.\n\nHe's promised mass deportations of millions of migrants and suggested the United States would not defend foreign allies from aggression in certain circumstances. He's vowed to eviscerate the federal bureaucracy and staff those career civil service roles with political loyalists, use law enforcement to target foes, and painted a dire picture of America's future if he does not return to the White House.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn two wide-ranging interviews with TIME Magazine published Tuesday, Trump expanded upon that vision for a second term, which would buck traditional conservative viewpoints about the role of government and expand the powers of the presidency that he would then wield against a wide range of groups in America.\n\nTrump touched on a number of topics that are important factors to voters ahead of November, like abortion, crime and the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump also made eyebrow-raising comments about political violence, using the military against civilians and about the multiple criminal cases against him.\n\nHere's a few takeaways from one of the few longform interviews Trump has given this election cycle:\n\nAbortion\n\nOne of the biggest flashpoints in politics the last few years has been abortion access, following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\nTrump has largely sidestepped questions about what specific policy he would support as president, and continued to do so in the TIME interview, arguing that the decisions are now made at the state level.\n\n\"I won't have to commit to [federal abortion restrictions] because it'll never \u2014 number one, it'll never happen,\" Trump said in the interview transcript. \"Number two, it's about states' rights. You don't want to go back into the federal government.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nTrump also deflected on a question about access to abortion pills, promising to release a statement on that \"over the next 14 days.\"\n\nThat's an important question to answer, and one with great political consequence. As NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben has reported, Trump allies are pushing for him to enforce the Comstock Act, a 19th century law that could be used to halt the mailing of abortion pills and essentially stop all abortion in the U.S.\n\nThe former president insisted that it was up to states to make all decisions about abortion, including if they would monitor pregnancies to know if someone has an abortion or prosecuting them.\n\n\"It's irrelevant whether I'm comfortable or not,\" Trump said of the prosecution of women for having abortions. \"It's totally irrelevant, because the states are going to make those decisions.\"\n\nSo far, voters have sided with abortion rights advocates every time the issue has been placed on the ballot, and several states \u2014 like Florida, where Trump lives \u2014 will have similar questions on the ballot this year. He declined to indicate how he will vote on that issue in November as well.\n\nImmigration\n\nTrump's aggressive stance on immigration is a cornerstone of his 2024 campaign, as well as a key issue for many Republican primary voters. But it's not just Republicans that have concerns about the U.S.-Mexico border, making Trump's pronouncements about immigration and migrants especially noteworthy.\n\nIn campaign stump speeches, Trump has vowed to enact \"the largest domestic deportation operation\" in history and roll back virtually every Biden administration policy around the border. He continues to equate immigrants with crime, often mentioning murders and other grisly crimes committed by noncitizens as evidence that a crackdown is needed under his watch.\n\nIn the TIME interview, Trump takes that rhetoric a step further, suggesting he would use the National Guard and the U.S. military to go after migrants, potentially in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act that prevents federal troops from being used against civilians. When asked about that provision, he falsely said people in the country illegally \"aren't civilians\" and would not rule out constructing additional migrant detention camps.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nPolitical violence, law enforcement and criminal indictments\n\nTrump once said on Sean Hannity's show that he would not want to be a dictator \"except for day one: I want to close the border, and I want to drill, drill, drill.\" Like many of his inflammatory claims, Trump said it was meant sarcastically as a joke, but it's just a small part of the aggrieved view he would bring to law enforcement in a second term.\n\nIn the interview, Trump claimed that a lot of people \"like\" language about being a dictator, and did not understand why anyone took it as anything other than a jest.\n\nTrump said he is not worried about political violence in this year's presidential election, but implied it would be because he is victorious in November.\n\n\"Well, I do think we're gonna win. We're way ahead. I don't think they'll be able to do the things that they did the last time, which were horrible. Absolutely horrible. So many, so many different things they did, which were in total violation of what was supposed to be happening. And you know that and everybody knows that. We can recite them, go down a list that would be an arm's long. But I don't think we're going to have that. I think we're going to win. And if we don't win, you know, it depends. It always depends on the fairness of an election. I don't believe they'll be able to do the things that they did the last time. I don't think they'll be able to get away with it. And if that's the case, we're gonna win in record-setting fashion.\"\n\nHe faces multiple criminal trials in several states, including charges of federal election interference stemming from a hush money payment made to adult film star Stormy Daniels that he is facing trial for in New York currently; and a racketeering case in Georgia stemming from his failed efforts to overturn his 2020 defeat there, and more than 800 of his supporters have been sentenced for various crimes stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection attempt at the U.S. Capitol seeking to stop the transfer of power to President Biden.\n\nTrump repeated that he would consider pardoning those supporters.\n\nAt several times over the last few years, Trump has suggested he would go after political opponents and seek to prosecute them, ranging from Biden to local district attorneys that do not align with his views on crime.\n\nIn the interview, Trump said he would not go after Biden, but if the Supreme Court did not find presidential immunity applied to Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election, then Biden would be \"prosecuted for all of his crimes, because he's committed many crimes.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThere's no criminal charges currently pending against Biden, and a year-long effort to impeach the president over alleged improper business dealings with his son Hunter has stalled with no evidence of crimes.\n\nIf elected again, Trump would gut the federal bureaucracy and remake it in his ideological view, using something called Schedule F to fire career nonpartisan civil servants. A similar purge and rebuilding of the Republican National Committee and several key state Republican parties has taken place in recent years, with Trump's daughter-in-law Lara leading the RNC alongside former North Carolina GOP Chair Michael Whatley.\n\nTrump said in the interview he would not hire anyone who believed Biden won the 2020 election, continuing to repeat false claims that voter fraud cost him the presidency but saw Republicans elected up and down the ballot in key states.",

        "text": "Biden\u2019s historic marijuana shift is his latest election year move for young voters\nPHOENIX (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden may eventually ban TikTok, but he\u2019s moving to give something back to the young people who dominate the popular social media app \u2014 a looser federal grip on marijuana.\n\nFacing softening support from a left-leaning voting group that will be crucial to his reelection hopes in November, Biden has made a number of election year moves intended to appeal in particular to younger voters. His move toward reclassifying marijuana as a less dangerous drug is just the latest, coming weeks after he canceled student loans for another 206,000 borrowers. He has also made abortion rights central to his case for reelection.\n\nThe push to highlight issues that resonate with younger voters comes as the Democratic president fights to hold together the coalition that sent him to the White House in 2020.\n\nBiden, the oldest president in U.S. history at 81, is battling a perception among voters that he\u2019s lost a step as he\u2019s aged. Discontent with his handling of Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza has exploded into unrest on college campuses. While inflation has ebbed from its peak and the job market remains strong, polls show many Americans still hold negative views of Biden\u2019s handling of the economy.\n\nEXPLAINER: What reclassifying marijuana means for Americans\n\nA proposal by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration would recognize the medical uses of cannabis and acknowledge it has less potential for abuse than some of the nation\u2019s most dangerous drugs. However, it would not legalize marijuana outright for recreational use.\n\nBiden called for a review of federal marijuana law in October 2022 and moved to pardon thousands of Americans convicted federally of simple possession of the drug. He has also called on governors and local leaders to take similar steps to erase marijuana convictions.\n\n\u201cThe American people have made clear in state after state that cannabis legalization is inevitable,\u201d Rep. Earl Blumenauer, an Oregon Democrat and an early proponent of easing marijuana laws, said in a statement. \u201cThe Biden-Harris administration is listening.\u201d\n\nBiden and Vice President Kamala Harris both touted their support for marijuana law reform to mark the 4/20 cannabis holiday at 4:20 p.m. Saturday.\n\nThe comments are the latest sign the Biden administration plans to continue to focus on the popular issue ahead of the November election.\n\n\u201cSending people to prison just for possessing marijuana has upended too many lives and incarcerated people for conduct that many states no longer prohibit,\u201d Biden posted on the social media platform X. \u201cIt\u2019s time that we right these wrongs.\u201d\n\nThe politics of marijuana are favorable for the president.\n\nREAD MORE: Thousands convicted of marijuana charges on federal lands and in Washington to receive pardons\n\nAccording to AP VoteCast, 63 percent of voters nationally in the 2022 midterm elections said they favor legalizing recreational use of marijuana nationwide, compared with 36 percent who said they were opposed. Support for legalization was higher among adults under age 45, 73 percent of whom were in favor. About 8 in 10 Democrats, roughly two-thirds of independents and about half of Republicans were in favor.\n\nBiden has issued pardons to thousands of people for federal marijuana possession and commuted long sentences handed down for nonviolent drug offenses. In 2022, he urged governors to pardon state offenses.\n\nWhile young voters lean left, they are also less likely to vote. Biden can\u2019t afford for a reliable group of supporters to stay home or vote for a third-party candidate like independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is aggressively courting young voters, or the Green Party\u2019s Jill Stein, who is leaning into her opposition to Israel\u2019s war in Gaza.\n\nThe last two elections were decided by fewer than 100,000 votes in three states.\n\nDespite growing public acceptance, Biden\u2019s move has prominent detractors, including several former top DEA officials. Opponents say the potency of today\u2019s marijuana could lead to harmful side effects, including psychosis and anxiety.\n\n\u201cThis is a political act \u2014 it\u2019s not following the science,\u201d said former DEA Administrator Tim Shea. \u201cIt\u2019s politics in election year. It\u2019s like forgiving student loans. It\u2019s aimed at a select group of people and the impact is going to be bad.\u201d\n\n\u201cLaw enforcement can\u2019t believe it\u2019s happening,\u201d Shea added.\n\nDuring the crack epidemic of the 1980s and \u201990s, then-Sen. Biden was a prominent voice in the war on drugs.\n\nEthan Nadelmann, who has been advocating for drug legalization for decades, said Biden probably senses now that a more lenient stance on pot could help rally younger voters and progressive members of his party.\n\n\u201cIt will end the hypocrisy,\u201d Nadelmann said.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump\u2019s views on marijuana are unclear. But as a resident of Florida he\u2019ll have the chance to vote on a legalization initiative on the ballot in November. In an interview last year with Newsmax, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee said pot causes \u201csignificant damage\u201d even as he acknowledged that legalizing cannabis is a \u201cpretty popular thing\u201d among voters.\n\nFederal drug policy has lagged behind much of the country, with 38 states having already legalized medical marijuana in addition to 24 that have approved its recreational use. That\u2019s helped fuel fast growth in the U.S. marijuana industry, with sales estimated to be worth $25 billion a year.\n\nEasing federal regulations could reduce the tax burden that can be 70 percent or more by allowing businesses to take tax deductions and seek loans, according to industry groups. It could also make it easier for scientists to research marijuana.\n\nAssociated Press writers Joshua Goodman in Miami and Jim Mustian in New Orleans contributed.",

State law requires a person to be a U.S. citizen in order to be eligible to register in South Carolina. This is the core foundation of election integrity and the SEC remains steadfast in protecting our democracy and the sanctity of every vote.\n\nThe SEC is actively auditing voter data through the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) Program database to ensure that only U.S. citizens are included on the active list of registered voters. Regardless of the method of registration, no voter may be registered in South Carolina without signing an oath swearing that they are a citizen of the United States. The auditing process ensures that any bad actors are removed from voter rolls and held accountable through state and federal election law statutes.\n\nTo date, the SEC has not received any specific information that non-U.S. citizens are fraudulently being registered to vote in our state.\n\n\u201cThe SEC will not allow fraudulent voter registration to happen on our watch,\u201d said Howie Knapp, Executive Director of the SEC. \u201cShould we receive or discover information that non-U.S. citizens are being registered to vote in our state, we will immediately report to our law enforcement partners for investigation and prosecution to the fullest extent of the law. The SEC will continue to be vigilant in following our state\u2019s election laws to ensure elections in South Carolina are conducted with integrity.\u201d\n\nTo learn more, download a one-page sheet for facts about voter registration in South Carolina or visit scVOTES.gov.",

        "text": "Opinion: If Trump wins, I might leave America for good\nEditor\u2019s Note: David A. Andelman, a contributor to CNN, twice winner of the Deadline Club Award, is a chevalier of the French Legion of Honor, author of \u201cA Red Line in the Sand: Diplomacy, Strategy, and the History of Wars That Might Still Happen\u201d and blogs at SubStack\u2019s Andelman Unleashed. He formerly was a foreign correspondent and bureau chief for The New York Times in Europe and Asia and for CBS News in Paris. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN\n\nParis CNN \u2014\n\nI\u2019ve been an on-again, off-again resident of France for some 44 years, at times quite permanently, more often peripatetically, always in the same building around the corner from the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay and directly across the Seine from the Tuileries.\n\nDavid A. Andelman CNN\n\nWe were never really forced to make a choice whether it should become our home, permanently. Now, along with hordes of our fellow Americans, we are considering just such a move.\n\nIn a growing number of cases, that reason can be traced to one proximate source \u2014 former President Donald Trump. Or more precisely \u2014 how he has torn apart America and our democracy that, for my nearly 80 years on this planet, I have cherished.\n\nAnd as I began asking ever more widely about this concern, my wife, Pamela, and I have found a growing sentiment that we are hardly alone.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first thing they say, \u2018get me out of [America],\u2019\u201d said Adrian Leeds. For a quarter century, through her Adrian Leeds Group real estate agency, she has been advising mostly American folks who are considering a move to France on how to find a place to live. \u201cBut now there\u2019s a real wave of younger people who are saying, \u2018we don\u2019t want to bring our kids up in this country. We really we want to give our kids the best. And we\u2019re very unhappy,\u2019\u201d she told me.\n\nAnd the trend only seems to be accelerating. \u201cWe\u2019re up 100%, we\u2019ve doubled our business year to date, January through March, over a year ago,\u201d Leeds continued. \u201cIt\u2019s going so fast the numbers are insane. I hear it every single day: \u2018Get me out!\u2019\u201d\n\nOf course, it\u2019s not only France where such discussions are happening. \u201cBeginning in 2020, we went from Americans being 5% of our clients to becoming today 70%,\u201d Patricia Casaburi, CEO of London-based Global Citizen Solutions, an upmarket migration consultancy firm, said in a Zoom interview from Dubai. And most recently, the number of Americans \u201chas only been increasing,\u201d she added.\n\nTo be sure, there are reasons for Americans to make the move beyond the prospects of a second Trump presidency. \u201cWhen you have mass shootings in schools, they just trigger people to act on something that they\u2019ve been considering for a while,\u201d said Casaburi. But, she added, \u201cdefinitely the political agenda does influence people.\u201d\n\nTony Kahn, a veteran former producer for PBS and NPR, was sitting in a hotel lobby in Mexico City earlier this month making just such calculations.\n\n\u201cAt the very minute you\u2019re asking me, I have mixed feelings about the extent to which America is my country,\u201d Kahn said in a zoom conversation between my perhaps not-so-temporary abode in Paris and Mexico City. In Kahn\u2019s youth, \u201cMexico took us in when America did not want us, basically. That is the fact of the matter. Mexico was always home to expatriates as long as they didn\u2019t practice the politics that got them in trouble in their own country,\u201d he said.\n\nIn 1950, at age eight, Kahn and his entire family fled to Mexico when his father, the renowned Hollywood screenwriter Gordon Kahn, was summoned by the feared House Committee on Un-American Activities over alleged communist ties to the film industry. He never ended up testifying.\n\nHis father was pursued nearly to the end of his life at age 62 by J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI. Today, Kahn fears similar perils are not so far over the horizon.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a feeling of safety that you have and a feeling of belonging in Mexico,\u201d Kahn continued. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of a stranger going berserk [at me] there because I\u2019m Jewish. At the same time, I\u2019m not possessed by this feeling that I\u2019ve got to get out of America right now before it\u2019s too late, but I\u2019m getting close to it,\u201d he said.\n\nOver the past six months, he\u2019s made five trips to Mexico City with his wife preparing for a final decision.\n\nThere are all sorts of avenues of escape, too. There are those who are simply seeking a refuge where they can work and live unfettered without any pressing need to acquire second citizenship. In France, for instance, there is a range of options \u2014 from simple visas that allow people to stay beyond the 90 days out of 180 under European rules, to the carte de residence (renewable every 10 years).\n\nIn most countries, like France, to make that next leap towards citizenship means learning the language and customs as well.\n\nThen there are the \u201cgolden passports,\u201d where in some countries, broad categories or levels of investment can be a fast track toward citizenship, or a \u201ctalent passport\u201d if you\u2019re bringing unique personal capacities.\n\n\u201cA lot of people now know what a Trump administration will look like, and they\u2019re realizing more than ever that the doors are open to live in another country and it\u2019s not as challenging as they thought it might be,\u201d Paris-based immigration lawyer Daniel Tostado told me.\n\nEight years ago, at the very start of Trump\u2019s rise to the presidency, Skyler Schmanski became one of these Americans making a choice. He\u2019d come to France to study at a Marseilles business school. Now he plans to stay.\n\n\u201cI began to experience the quality of life that\u2019s over here,\u201d he told me. \u201cWhether it\u2019s the education or the healthcare, but when I start entering that next chapter of life in my 30s, those things start to ring more true,\u201d he said. Now, with a wife and a career, and finally French citizenship, he has no doubt he made the right choice.\n\nSchmanski recalls two pocketbook issues that were deeply persuasive. \u201cI cracked my head open at midnight when I stood up under an armoire door I wasn\u2019t aware was open above me, saw blood, passed out, woke up and thought, \u201cI should probably go to the hospital. But as a good American I went, \u2018no, I don\u2019t want to go to the hospital. I don\u2019t want the $20,000 bill.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cBut my girlfriend, now my wife, said, \u2018go to the hospital, it\u2019s covered.\u2019 And I walked out with a 15 Euro [$16] bill. Wow 15 Euros. To sew up my head. So, I went, \u2018Wait a minute. Maybe there\u2019s a little something to the system over here.\u2019\u201d\n\nThen there was grad school. \u201cI went to business school, a very good master\u2019s program in 15 months, in and out for the equivalent of $15,000,\u201d Schmanski said.\n\nThe most popular destinations at the moment for Americans looking for a way out, seem to be Spain, Portugal and Greece, according to Casaburi of Global Citizens Solutions. She added that Italy was a popular choice for a time, but suggested that the arrival of hard-right Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni made some Americans question whether they might be risking a move from the frying pan to the fire.\n\nAs for my wife and me, a permanent move to France would not be such a leap \u2014 merely, as would be the case for many others, it would be an extension of the time we spend there today.\n\nBut do the next generation of Americans also see their futures elsewhere? \u201cIn the past, the conversations we have had with Americans is, \u2018do I need to go and retire in Europe?\u2019 but now the pool of people is a very different profile \u2014 younger families,\u201d said Casaburi.\n\n\u201cSo, at some point there\u2019s a cost for the country when you\u2019re losing out on income taxpayers, but also talented young professionals,\u201d she added.\n\nAs Casaburi, herself a Brazilian who now lives in London, concluded, \u201cAmericans suddenly found themselves in a position where they feel that they don\u2019t know who their neighbors are or their family members.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it matters much on which side of the political spectrum you find yourself. I think everyone\u2019s re-evaluating a bit of everything,\u201d she said.\n\nAs for us, much would depend on just what the nature of Trump\u2019s pledge to embrace the role of dictator-for-a-day turns out to be. As Pamela says, \u201cit depends how safe we feel in the type of country he\u2019s promising \u2014 one that\u2019s no longer a democracy.\u201d",

        "text": "What the Supreme Court is doing right in considering Trump\u2019s immunity case\nFollowing the nearly three-hour oral argument about presidential immunity in the Supreme Court on April 25, 2024, many commentators were aghast. The general theme, among legal and political experts alike, was a hand-over-the-mouth, how-dare-they assessment of the mostly conservative justices\u2019 questioning of the attorneys who appeared before them in the case known as Trump v. United States.\n\nRather than a laser-focused, deep dive into the details of Trump\u2019s attempt to subvert the 2020 election, virtually all of the nine justices instead raised larger questions, peppered with hypotheticals \u2013 hello again, Seal Team Six! \u2013 about the reach of executive power, the intent of the nation\u2019s founders and the best way to promote a stable democracy.\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m not focused on the here and now of this case\u201d and Justice Neil Gorsuch\u2019s \u201cWe are writing a rule for the ages\u201d drew particular fire.\n\nThe headline and subheadline on the New York Times analysis by Supreme Court reporter Adam Liptak complained that the court had taken \u201cTrump\u2019s immunity arguments in unexpected direction\u201d with \u201cvery little about the President\u2019s conduct.\u201d And the story itself fumed that the justices had responded to Trump\u2019s claim that he should not face charges as a \u201cweighty and difficult question.\u201d\n\nSlate\u2019s Amicus podcast decried the court for failing to focus on the \u201cnarrow question\u201d the case presented, instead going \u201coff the rails\u201d and \u201cbouncing all over the map\u201d with various legal arguments. A guest on NPR\u2019s 1A program lamented that the court had \u201cinjected new questions\u201d into the oral argument to \u201cslow-walk\u201d the case and prevent Trump from facing trial before the election.\n\nBut here\u2019s what the pundits seem to have forgotten: What happened that day in the court should have surprised no one, especially those constitutional scholars like me familiar with Supreme Court procedure.\n\nFive words \u2018change everything\u2019\n\nTrump\u2019s case stemmed from his prosecution by Special Counsel Jack Smith for his alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. Trump claimed he, as president, was immune from prosecution, and he took his case to the Supreme Court.\n\nWhen parties appeal their case to the court, they must tell the justices what specific legal question or questions they want the justices to answer. As a colleague and I have explored in a recent academic journal article, the court generally accepts what is called the \u201cQuestions Presented\u201d as given, agreeing to hear a case without making any adjustments to its legal framing.\n\nSometimes, however, the court will alter the legal question in some way. Why it does this is an issue that scholars like myself are just beginning to explore. And because it is that question \u2013 not the one the litigant initially asked \u2013 that frames the legal analysis, the justices can exert real control over both the case itself and the development of the law.\n\nTrump v. United States is a classic example. When attorneys for the former president filed their request with the court, the question presented by them was \u201cWhether the doctrine of absolute presidential immunity includes immunity from criminal prosecution for a President\u2019s official acts.\u201d\n\nWhen it granted the petition in late February 2024, the court changed this language to \u201cWhether and if so to what extent does a former President enjoy presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office.\u201d\n\nFive of those additional words \u2013 \u201cif so to what extent\u201d \u2013 changed everything. They sent a clear-as-day signal that the court would move well beyond the simple yes-or-no of whether Trump could be prosecuted.\n\nThe court doing its job\n\nWith their reformulation of the question, the justices would instead be determining how, when and for what acts any president could ever be held criminally responsible.\n\nThat is a much larger inquiry, one that necessarily involves formulating a legal test to draw a line between what is constitutionally permissible and what is not. That the justices spent oral argument trying do exactly that is not a problem, much less an outrage: It\u2019s just the court, the highest appellate court in the land, doing its job.\n\nThe scope of the argument, the expansiveness of the coming opinions and the time suck for the justices to write them and the possible vanishing of Trump\u2019s prosecution are not at all shocking. The court signaled it would address the broader question months ago when it took the case; the time to fault the court for making the case about more than just Donald Trump was then, not now.\n\nBut perhaps commentators\u2019 response to the oral argument can be a good lesson. Americans are told to take Trump at his word, expecting his second term to contain all the extremes he gleefully says it will.\n\nWhen the Supreme Court indicates what legal question it will answer, the smart response is to do the same thing \u2013 pay attention and believe. This may not make the ultimate outcome any less distasteful to many, but at least it won\u2019t be quite as disturbing.",

        "text": "Former Attorney General Barr prepares to vote for Trump, despite calling him 'unfit for office' \u2022 Kansas Reflector\nTOPEKA \u2014 Former U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr said the disappointing nomination of Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden for president of the United States would compel voters to make a decision about which of two unfit candidates would be the lesser evil during the next four years in the White House.\n\nBarr, a conservative Republican who served in the administrations of Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and Trump, said during an appearance Monday at the 100th anniversary of the Kansas Chamber that he would vote for the Republican ticket given the option of two major party nominees he viewed as unfit for office.\n\nHe said he would cast a ballot for former President Trump, who was his boss for nearly two years as attorney general, rather than endorse reelection of President Biden, who defeated Trump in 2020.\n\n\u201cI opposed Trump for the nomination and I spoke out, you know, from the time I left the administration to just about now, hoping that someone else would be the Republican nominee,\u201d Barr said. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is that between the two of those candidates, Biden and Trump, I plan to vote Republican.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think either of them are good candidates, and I think I have to vote for the person I think will do the least damage,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump took to Truth Social to express a degree of gratitude to Barr by deleting the word \u201clethargic\u201d from a previous description of him as \u201cweak, slow moving, lethargic, gutless and lazy.\u201d Trump also blasted Barr for not aggressively investigating allegations of widespread voter fraud in the United States. Barr, who resigned as attorney general after Trump\u2019s loss to Biden, said claims that a multistate conspiracy denied him reelection in 2020 were groundless.\n\nWorking class hero\n\nBarr, who also served as attorney general under the first President Bush, spoke to hundreds of people at the Kansas Chamber\u2019s annual gathering in Topeka. In 2023, the organization\u2019s keynote speaker was former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who represented Kansas in the U.S. House before joining the Trump administration.\n\nIn a news conference, Barr declined to say whether a person ordered by a court to pay multimillion-dollar civil judgments and facing dozens of felony charges should be considered a viable candidate for president.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too early to tell exactly how these criminal cases are going to work out. I personally think a lot of them are bogus,\u201d Barr said. \u201cI\u2019ve said I didn\u2019t think he\u2019s fit to be president. I don\u2019t think Biden\u2019s fit to be president. So, it\u2019s a comparison. You have to look at the whole picture of all the pros and cons and given that I think the country will be far worse off after four years of Biden than four years of Trump.\u201d\n\nBarr, who began work with the American Free Enterprise Chamber of Commerce after leaving the federal government, said the appeal and resilience of Trump on the campaign trail was built on frustrations of working-class Americans who felt ignored by the government and gravitated to Trump in 2016, 2020 and would again in 2024.\n\nWhile Barr disputed Trump\u2019s theories about election fraud in 2020, he said attempts by politicians to gain marginal advantages in elections by adjusting laws to tilt the playing field one way or another were counterproductive to rebuilding confidence in the electoral system.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of passion in the system and it\u2019s absolutely critical that people have confidence in the outcome of the election. If we want to avoid the breakdown in the system completely, all Americans should get behind absolute integrity in elections,\u201d he said.\n\nBarr said states should prohibit the gathering of completed ballots \u2014 a process referred to by critics as \u201cballot harvesting\u201d \u2014 for delivery to election offices or ballot boxes. He said mail-in balloting, if allowed, had to be restricted to verified, qualified voters. He said the window for advance voting should be no longer than a few days and certainly not a span that resembled \u201can election season.\u201d\n\nBiden: Buying votes\n\nIn terms of national security, Barr said he couldn\u2019t recall a more dangerous moment in his lifetime as it related to challenges facing the United States. He said expansionist objectives of Russia, Iran and China were intended to displace the United States as a global power. China, in particular, was dedicated to completing a geopolitical shift by seizing Taiwan to the embarrassment of the United States, he said.\n\nIt meant U.S. presidents and members of Congress had to be firmly committed to Taiwan, Ukraine and Israel to avoid the appearance of abandoning allies, Barr said.\n\n\u201cThe United States needs friends in the world,\u201d said Barr, who worked for the CIA early in his government career. \u201cCollective security is important.\u201d\n\nBarr said Biden blundered into a crisis on the border with Mexico by reversing Trump administration policies forbidding undocumented foreign nationals from entering the United States pending evaluation of asylum claims. He said champions of border security shouldn\u2019t be intimidated by allegations they were \u201cracists or hated foreigners\u201d for seeking an orderly and fair system of immigration.\n\nHe said he was puzzled by Biden\u2019s insistence on eliminating without congressional authority repayment of college loan obligations after the U.S. Supreme Court shot down an executive order waiving hundreds of millions of dollars in debts.\n\n\u201cTo me, it was a clear example of trying to buy votes using public assets \u2014 to buy votes in an election year,\u201d Barr said.\n\nBarr faulted higher education administrators for failing to curtail protests on college campuses by critics of Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza. The Gaza Health Ministry says airstrikes, street fighting and a six-month siege had led to the death in Gaza of an estimated 33,000 people since Hamas infiltrated Israel to kill more than 1,000 people and take hostages.\n\nHe drew a distinction between protests against the U.S.-led war in Vietnam when he was a student at Columbia University in 1968 and current campus unrest in opposition to fighting by Israel in Gaza. He said protesters in the 1960s had a personal stake because they could be drafted to fight an unpopular war in Southeast Asia. There was no parallel connection for Americans to the battle in Gaza, he said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s taking these cities and college administrators so long to restore order on campus,\u201d Barr said. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the general lawlessness that is gradually overwhelming our system. This has nothing to do with First Amendment rights and expression. You can express your view. You can hold your sign. But this kind of violence, this kind of bullying of everybody else, it has to be met firmly.\u201d",

        "text": "Trump on political violence in 2024: 'If we don't win, you know, it depends'\nFormer President Donald Trump said in a new interview with Time magazine that he doesn't think there will be political violence around the 2024 election because he believes he'll win \u2014 but that it \"always depends on the fairness of an election.\"\n\nThe comments came along with a statement that Trump would \"consider\" pardoning every person who has been charged or convicted for rioting at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, after the then-president rallied his followers against what he has repeatedly and baselessly called a \"rigged\" election.\n\nTrump also answered questions digging into his campaign position on abortion policy being left up to the states \u2014 and deflecting questions pressing him on any potential federal action, including his position on whether abortion medication should be available. And Trump reinforced past statements he has made on Russia doing \u201cwhatever the hell they want\u201d to NATO countries who don\u2019t pay their \u201cfair share\u201d and the extent of a military crackdown he plans to order on illegal immigration.\n\nWhen Trump was asked in an initial interview about the prospect of more political violence in 2024, after the events following the 2020 election, he said no. \"I think we're gonna have a big victory. And I think there will be no violence,\" Trump said.\n\nBut asked in a follow-up conversation about what will happen if he doesn't win, Trump was equivocal.\n\n\"Well, I do think we're gonna win,\" Trump answered. \"We're way ahead. I don't think they'll be able to do the things that they did the last time, which were horrible. Absolutely horrible. So many, so many different things they did, which were in total violation of what was supposed to be happening. And you know that and everybody knows that. We can recite them, go down a list that would be an arm\u2019s long. But I don't think we're going to have that. I think we're going to win. And if we don't win, you know, it depends. It always depends on the fairness of an election.\"\n\nTrump also said that he'd be reluctant to hire people for a second administration who thought President Joe Biden won the 2020 election: \"I wouldn\u2019t feel good about it,\" he said.\n\nOn the people charged and convicted of violent acts as Congress was preparing to certify the 2020 election results on Jan. 6, 2021, Trump complained that they've faced a \"two-tier system\" but, when pressed, said, \"I would consider that, yes,\" when asked if he'd consider pardoning every single person prosecuted for their actions on Jan. 6.\n\n'The states are going to have to be comfortable or uncomfortable, not me'\n\nTrump's rare long-form interview included him talking through his position on leaving abortion policy up to states. When asked directly if he was comfortable with states deciding to punish women who access abortions after the designated state-specific ban, Trump said: \u201cI don\u2019t have to be comfortable or uncomfortable. The states are going to make that decision. The states are going to have to be comfortable or uncomfortable, not me.\u201d\n\nThen, asked if women\u2019s pregnancies should be monitored by state governments to ensure they don\u2019t get abortions after a certain timeline ban, Trump said: \"I think they might do that. Again, you\u2019ll have to speak to the individual states.\u201d\n\nTrump also dodged on the question of whether women should have access to abortion pills. As the interviewer noted that Republican allies of Trump have called \"for enforcement of the Comstock Act, which prohibits the mailing of drugs used for abortions by mail,\" Trump said he will be making a statement later but declined to outline his position.\n\n\"I will be making a statement on that over the next 14 days,\" Trump said. In the follow-up interview on April 27, Time noted that Trump had not yet made the statement even though two weeks had passed.\n\n\"I\u2019ll be doing it over the next week or two,\" Trump said. \"But I don't think it will be shocking, frankly. But I'll be doing it over the next week or two.\"\n\nTrump recently said that it should also be up to individual states to determine any penalty for doctors who perform abortions outside state law. He labeled a question about what he'd do on potential federal legislation on abortion a hypothetical \"because it won't happen. You're never going to have 60 votes.\"\n\n'I can see myself using the National Guard and, if necessary, I\u2019d have to go a step further'\n\nWhen asked about immigration, Trump reiterated a consistent campaign promise to use the U.S. military to remove undocumented immigrants from the country.\n\nAnd Trump said he'd be willing to use other parts of the U.S. military besides the National Guard to address issues inland as well as the border, saying, \u201cI can see myself using the National Guard and, if necessary, I\u2019d have to go a step further.\" When the interviewer noted the law preventing the deployment of the military against civilians, Trump claimed undocumented immigrants weren't civilians and said: \"These are people that aren\u2019t legally in our country. This is an invasion of our country.\"\n\nTrump has previously vowed to relocate thousands of overseas U.S troops to the southern border to crack down on border security as well as promising to terminate \u201cevery open border policy of the Biden administration.\u201d\n\nThe Biden campaign responded Tuesday, criticizing both Trump's record and his campaign rhetoric.\n\n\"He isn\u2019t just committing to reimplement the cruel, systematic policies of ripping away mothers from their children from his time in office \u2014 he\u2019s pledging to go further by using the military and law enforcement to enact his cruel, anti-American, and ineffective immigration policies,\" campaign co-chair Veronica Escobar said in a statement. She added that Americans \"want solutions at our border, not more sick political stunts that come at the expense of the most vulnerable and with an embrace of authoritarianism.\"\n\nTrump also floated the idea of migrant detention camps, calling it a \"possibility\" but something he hopes \"we shouldn\u2019t have to do very much of.\"\n\nAt the core of Trump's immigration promises over the last year is the use of local law enforcement, though policy specifics surrounding the idea have been scarce.\n\nWhen asked to clarify, Trump proposed \u201cpolice immunity from prosecution\u201d and left the door open to possible incentives from the federal government for state and local police departments.\n\n'If you\u2019re not going to pay, then you\u2019re on your own'\n\nOn international affairs, Trump again dug in on recent comments that Russia could \u201cdo whatever the hell they want\u201d to NATO countries who do not \u201cpay up\u201d what he deems are appropriate military expenses.\n\nTrump told Time, \u201cYeah, when I said that, I said it with great meaning, because I want them to pay. I want them to pay up. That was said as a point of negotiation. I said, Look, if you\u2019re not going to pay, then you\u2019re on your own. And I mean that.\"\n\nTrump also backed up comments that he wouldn\u2019t \u201cgive a penny\u201d to Ukraine unless other European countries started supporting Ukraine in \u201cequalizing\u201d amounts.\n\n\"I said I wouldn't give unless Europe starts equalizing,\" Trump said. \"They have to come. Europe has to pay. We are in for so much more than the European nations. It's very unfair to us. And I said if Europe isn't going to pay, who are gravely more affected than we are, if Europe is not going to pay, why should we pay?\"\n\nTrump also conceded that a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians looks \u201cvery, very tough\" and said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has \"rightfully\" been criticized for the fact that Hamas was able to attack Israel on Oct. 7.",

        "text": "Inside the far-right plan to use civil rights law to disrupt the 2024 election\nAt a diner just off the freeway north of Sacramento, a mostly white crowd listened intently as it learned how to \u201csave America\u201d by leaning on the same laws that enshrined the rights of Black voters 60 years ago.\n\nOver mugs of coffee and plates of pot roast smothered in gravy, attendees in MAGA and tea party gear took notes about the landmark Voting Rights Act and studied the U.S. Constitution. They peppered self-proclaimed \u201celection integrity\u201d activist Marly Hornik with questions about how to become skilled citizen observers monitoring California poll workers.\n\nThe nearly 90 people gathered in the diner in February were there to understand how they can do their part in a plan to sue California to block certification of the 2024 election results unless the state can prove that ballots were cast only by people eligible to vote.\n\nA Times series on how election misinformation spreads in America\n\nIf any votes are found to be ineligible, Hornik explained, then all voters are being disenfranchised \u2014 just like those decades ago who couldn\u2019t vote because of their race.\n\n\u201cIf we think our right of suffrage ... has been denied or diluted, we have to stop that immediately. We have to stop it right in its tracks,\u201d said Hornik, co-founder of a group called United Sovereign Americans, which is led by a man who helped push former President Trump\u2019s baseless challenges to Joe Biden\u2019s election in 2020.\n\nMarly Hornik, co-founder of United Sovereign Americans, speaks at a Sacramento diner in February 2024. (Mackenzie Mays / Los Angeles Times)\n\nThe two-hour meeting at the Northern California diner \u2014 one of several similar presentations that have taken place across the country in recent months \u2014 is part of the group\u2019s plan to file lawsuits in multiple states alleging voters\u2019 civil rights are violated by errors on the voter rolls. The goal is to prevent states from certifying federal elections in 2024 until substantial changes are made to election processes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat United Sovereign Americans has planned is a legal long shot. But election experts worry that if even one sympathetic judge rules in their favor, it could sow doubts about the integrity of a presidential rematch between President Biden and Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cSometimes the whole point is to whip up enough smoke that it seems like a fire,\u201d said Justin Levitt, a former deputy assistant attorney general who specializes in voting rights.\n\nThe group\u2019s legal arguments rely on faulty interpretations of federal election law and are likely to fail in court, according to Levitt and other experts who believe the group\u2019s evidence of voter registration fraud is overstated and inaccurate.\n\nUnited Sovereign Americans is part of a cottage industry of far-right election deniers that has sown disinformation since Trump lost his reelection bid. The group aims to scrutinize elections with a legal strategy that can \u201cthrow massive amounts of sand in their gears,\u201d Hornik said during a February presentation in Orange County.\n\nIts first lawsuit in the multi-state plan was filed against Maryland election officials on March 6, alleging that the state\u2019s voting policies don\u2019t comply with federal laws requiring accurate voter rolls and thus violate the plaintiffs\u2019 civil rights. The suit asks the court to keep the State Board of Elections from certifying any election until their claims of voter roll irregularities and other election law violations have been resolved, an action that could potentially derail Maryland\u2019s May 14 primary. On April 22, Maryland asked the judge hearing the case to dismiss the lawsuit or, at a minimum, deny the request for the restraining order.\n\nSimilar lawsuits are expected in coming weeks in California, Ohio, Illinois, Texas and several other states, Hornik said in an interview. Once they have built a legal fund for the suits, her group plans to file in multiple federal jurisdictions in hopes that judges will rule differently in different areas of the country, causing the Supreme Court to step in and settle the issue ahead of election day, she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn \u2018ecosystem of grift\u2019\n\nHornik said she lives in rural upstate New York with her \u201cthree home-birthed children\u201d and a small herd of dairy goats. The self-described \u201chome school mom\u201d has long gray hair and the air of a patient teacher as she fields questions and flips through PowerPoint slides explaining her plan to disrupt America\u2019s elections.\n\nShe drew laughs from the crowd in Sacramento as she cracked jokes about COVID protocols drawing people into \u201ca medical experiment.\u201d\n\nHornik became involved in an online community questioning election results while stuck at home during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, then went on to create a group called New York Citizens Audit in 2021. Its members spread conspiracy theories about the results of the 2020 and 2022 elections at events across the state.\n\nIn September, the New York attorney general issued a cease-and-desist letter ordering Hornik to stop \u201cvoter deception and intimidation efforts,\u201d describing complaints that volunteers with her group had \u201cconfronted voters across the state at their homes, falsely claimed to be Board of Elections officials and falsely accused voters of committing felony voter fraud.\u201d\n\nHornik said at the time that the group was not knocking on doors.\n\nShe expanded her efforts after teaming up with Harry Haury, whom she met at a 2022 conference hosted by the group that funded the debunked pro-Trump propaganda film \u201c2000 Mules,\u201d which is based on lies about the 2020 election.\n\nHaury, a St. Louis native with deep ties to the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d movement, approached Hornik about nationalizing the work of New York Citizens Audit. Haury had been part of a little-known team of self-proclaimed cybersecurity experts who helped search for evidence of fraud in the 2020 election for some of Trump\u2019s closest allies in the weeks after Trump lost. Haury\u2019s background as a software engineer has largely been focused on energy technology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupporters gather for a \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally in Atlanta after Donald Trump lost the 2020 presidential election. (Jason Armond / Los Angeles Times)\n\nTogether, they created United Sovereign Americans and began recruiting activists in at least 20 states to obtain voter registration rolls and analyze the data for potential errors \u2014 such as a person registered at multiple addresses or dead people with active registrations.\n\nHornik said they have completed examinations of voter rolls in Ohio, Illinois, New York and Texas, and they are finishing that work in California. Florida, Missouri and North Carolina are close behind.\n\nIn California, they are working with Election Integrity Project California, a nearly 15-year-old group that has been sending election observers to the polls since 2012. Linda Paine, a former Santa Clarita tea party activist now living in Arizona who leads the group, hosted Hornik for a three-day speaking tour in February with stops in Fresno, Shasta and Ventura counties.\n\nA federal lawsuit that Election Integrity Project California filed to challenge the state\u2019s election laws and procedures was dismissed, but the group has appealed.\n\nThe group has trained hundreds of poll watchers to observe whether local officials are following proper election procedures, including during the attempted recall of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPaine did not respond to requests for an interview.\n\nObservers from the Election Integrity Project watch ballots being processed in Orange County during California\u2019s 2021 gubernatorial recall election. (Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times)\n\nDavid Becker, who leads the Center for Election Innovation & Research, a group focused on restoring trust in the nation\u2019s election system, described the work of Paine and Hornik as \u201can effort to dismantle election integrity under the auspices of election integrity\u201d amid an \u201cecosystem of grift.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe grifters have evolved,\u201d Becker said. \u201cThey used to just say, \u2018There\u2019s so many dead and illegal voters on the list.\u2019 And then they started coming up with a really specific number ... as if there was some analysis that went into that.\u201d\n\nThe problem, he said, is that voter registration rolls obtained by these groups are a snapshot of a system that constantly changes as people move or die. It can\u2019t be compared to a static event like an election result: \u201cIt is not possible to maintain a voter list that is accurate at every single second of every single day.\u201d\n\nAs they\u2019ve crisscrossed the country spreading misinformation about election procedures, Hornik and Haury have asked for donations at public events and on far-right media, saying they need millions of dollars for their lawsuits. Their website allows donors to pick which state effort receives funds, with up to half going to the national group. In Shasta County in February, Hornik urged attendees to think about what they can do to help save America in 2024.\n\n\u201cI want to ask you to really look inside yourself and ask yourself what are you called to do to help this mission?\u201d she said, according to a recording of the event posted online.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAre you called to participate? Are you called to come and work on the resolutions? Are you called to work on the legal briefings? Are you called to write me a $10,000 check today? Because we need money to get this done.\u201d\n\nThe civil rights claim\n\nAt the diner in Sacramento, Hornik told the crowd that her plan to sue states for alleged civil rights violations should be easier than challenging results based on election laws.\n\n\u201cWe believe that this very simple approach can advance rapidly,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you weren\u2019t allowed to vote or if your vote was drowned and suffocated by invalid ballots, either way, you didn\u2019t really get to vote.\u201d\n\nHornik argues that people\u2019s constitutional right to choose their elected representatives is violated when the power of lawful votes is diminished by votes cast illegally.\n\nBut the entire plan is based on a count of alleged errors in the voter rolls conducted by volunteers who lack expertise in the election system and election law. Hornik\u2019s allies at Election Integrity Project California claim to have counted 257,894 people who voted in the state\u2019s 2022 election despite potentially being ineligible to cast ballots. But they did not explain their criteria for identifying alleged discrepancies in the voter rolls, raising serious questions about their count.\n\nThe volunteer analysts\u2019 work is reminiscent of past efforts by \u201carmchair detectives\u201d to examine voter rolls, said Levitt, the former deputy assistant attorney general. Their arguments claiming fraud are also based on fundamental misunderstandings of what is allowed under federal voting laws, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThese are people sitting at home who don\u2019t actually understand all that much about how the election structure works who are trying to impose their will on how the process is supposed to work on the government,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd their legal argument is based on a \u201creally troubling\u201d interpretation of civil rights law, said Sean Morales-Doyle, director of voting rights for the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\n\u201cThe idea that somehow the votes of ineligible voters is drowning out the votes of eligible voters is not at all based on reality,\u201d he said.\n\nThe concept of \u201cvote dilution\u201d stems from a provision of the Voting Rights Act that is meant to give people of color equal rights to elect the candidates of their choice. It typically comes up in disputes over drawing political boundaries where the preferences of a minority group could be diluted by a white majority that votes as a bloc.\n\n\u201cThe notion that this puts them in a similar situation to people who are actually being disenfranchised is just not a fair or reasonable analogy,\u201d Morales-Doyle said.\n\nHornik admits that her group does not expect to win a lawsuit against California. She said United Sovereign Americans intends to file lawsuits in least 11 states across nine federal court circuits. Failing in some and winning in others is part of the strategy to get to the Supreme Court, Hornik said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter that we are going to get turned down in New York. It doesn\u2019t matter that we get turned down potentially in California,\u201d Hornik said. \u201cIt matters that we get a favorable ruling in Tennessee and Missouri. It matters that we get a favorable ruling in Texas so that there is a diversity of opinion and ultimately that also means that there is a possibility that the matter is settled for the entire country.\u201d",

        "text": "\u2018The US is seen as a joke\u2019: American expats on Trump, Biden and the 2024 election\nSign up for the daily Inside Washington email for exclusive US coverage and analysis sent to your inbox Get our free Inside Washington email Get our free Inside Washington email SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our privacy policy\n\nAn election in which 1 in 6 Americans don\u2019t like either candidate is new territory. And no one finds themselves more called upon to defend their country\u2019s choices than the Americans who currently live abroad.\n\nStudies show there are clear differences in how the US is seen by outsiders when Democrats are in the White House versus when Republicans are. Democrats have held the White House for 11 out of the last 15 years. And for those 11 years, international views of the US were generally quite positive.\n\nJacob Poushter, an associate director at Pew Research Center, tells The Independent that \u201cin surveys that we conducted in 2017 around the world, we did see a precipitous decline in favourable views of the US\u201d following the inauguration of President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cIn particular, confidence in President Trump\u2019s ability to handle international affairs was drastically lower than [President Barack] Obama\u2019s, across virtually all the countries surveyed,\u201d he adds.\n\nBiden insists 'order must prevail' as police shut down college Gaza protests\n\n\u2018Everybody wanted to hear my thoughts on Trump\u2019\n\nHaylee Pearson, 33, experienced this firsthand while living in Madrid, Spain.\n\n\u201cWhen Trump won, everybody wanted to hear my thoughts on Trump: \u2018What do you think about Trump? What do your parents think about Trump? Do you own a gun? Does your parents own a gun?\u2019\u201d she says. As an American expat in western Europe, she experienced a frenzy of questions from interested people throughout Trump\u2019s term.\n\n\u201cAll of these taboo things would be in what seemed like a very trivial question [from] someone who I just met at a party or just met in a work setting,\u201d she says. \u201cTheir genuine curiosity was actually incredibly difficult for me \u2013 [it was hard] to explain all the time because I felt like I had to caveat like, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t support Trump. I don\u2019t agree with Trump. Please don\u2019t put me in that category of Americans \u2013 in that way of thinking.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe US expats that The Independent spoke to for this article all said they experienced similar sentiments from the residents of the places where they lived. In Canada and western Europe in particular, views of the US reached new highs during the presidency of Barack Obama, and then plummeted during the Trump years, before starting to recover as President Joe Biden came into office.\n\nIn late June 2016, Mr Pouschter and Richard Wike wrote for Pew, regarding Mr Obama: \u201cAround half or more in 15 of 16 countries surveyed, including the United States, have confidence in him to do the right thing regarding world affairs. This includes more than 80 per cent in Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany, France and Australia.\u201d\n\nNearly four years later, in January 2020, Mr Pouschter, Mr Wike, and two additional co-authors noted: \u201cAcross 32 countries surveyed by Pew Research Center, a median of 64 per cent say they do not have confidence in Trump to do the right thing in world affairs, while just 29 per cent express confidence in the American leader.\u201d\n\nIn June last year, across 23 countries, 54 per cent expressed confidence in Mr Biden, while 39 per cent said they did not have confidence in the president, according to the centre.\n\nMs Pearson left the US at the age of 26. After living in Madrid, she moved to London at the end of 2019.\n\n\u201cIn the time between 26 and now, I\u2019ve entered the corporate world, I\u2019ve gotten married, and I\u2019ve had my first child,\u201d she notes, adding that now \u201ceverything just seems more intense and more real\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe made a rule and even joked with my coworkers: no Trump talk, please don\u2019t ask me about Trump. I can\u2019t deal with it anymore,\u201d she adds.\n\nMaggie Fitzsimmons, 31, lives in London now. But she grew up in Arizona, went to college in Texas, and lived in New York City during her young adulthood \u2013 places that cover \u201cquite a broad range\u201d of political viewpoints, she says when speaking to The Independent.\n\nHaving left the US for a job opportunity in 2017, she says she has found that \u201cthere\u2019s this interesting inflexion point that happens when you\u2019ve hit five years abroad. In that, you both start to care less, but then you also realize how much more ridiculous it is [inside the US] at the same time\u201d.\n\n\u2018The whole character of where I was living had changed entirely\u2019\n\nIn 2020, at the age of 60, Alice Engelmore moved to Canada, after having lived in Ireland between 2013 and 2017. She moved during the pandemic, leaving California for Vancouver.\n\n\u201cI just felt that the whole character of where I was living had changed entirely; that people weren\u2019t being kind to each other. It was in the middle of the pandemic, and there was quite a split, even in my neighbourhood in California, where my neighbours were anti-vaxxers. And they were not complying with restrictions \u2026 having parties. And it was just very difficult,\u201d she tells The Independent.\n\n\u201cWhen Obama was elected in 2008, we saw a \u2026 jump in ratings from the lows of the George W Bush administration,\u201d Mr Poushter says, adding that the 2017 \u201cdecline in favorable views of the US was driven a lot by a lack of confidence in Trump and opposition to his signature foreign policy pledges, such as building a wall between the US and Mexico and withdrawing from international climate agreements.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought he\u2019d be indicted before he was elected,\u201d Ms Engelmore says, recalling what it was like in 2016. \u201cI honestly didn\u2019t think he would be elected.\u201d\n\n\u2018Negative aspects of US soft power\u2019\n\nMr Poushter cites an international survey amid the pandemic, which showed that one of the more negative aspects of US soft power was the \u201cUS standard of living.\u201d In particular, \u201cthe health care system got especially poor marks\u201d.\n\nMs Pearson believes \u201cBiden is almost trying to bring America up to the standard of living that Europeans and Brits already understand\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think people think that [the US] operates like a much poorer country than it is,\u201d Ms Fitsimmons says. \u201cI think people view it almost as a country that should be considered almost third-world, but it should be operating at a richer capacity than it is.\u201d\n\nShe adds that locals around her see the Biden-Trump rematch as a bit \u201csatirical\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey think it\u2019s kind of a joke of a country in a lot of ways,\u201d she says. \u201cI think it differs between the people who have spent time in America and know Americans versus those who maybe have watched it through TV. And those who have watched it through TV are probably the ones who think it\u2019s more of a joke, whereas people who have lived there, gone there, understand it a bit more.\u201d\n\nMs Fitsimmons says that when the topic of US politics comes up, locals may recall \u201csnippets of things they\u2019ve heard in the news. Like, \u2018Oh, is the wall still being built?\u2019 Or \u2018Trump, he was arrested, right? Didn\u2019t he have a mug shot?\u2019 \u2013 I think they pick up on little snippets that they\u2019ve seen, rather than engage in like intelligent discourse about it\u201d.\n\n\u2018America is not the greatest country. It never really has been\u2019\n\nMr Poushter says the ratings for Mr Biden \u201crange from country to country. Biden\u2019s very popular in Poland, for example \u2014 83 per cent have confidence in him. But in neighbouring Hungary, only 19 per cent have confidence in Biden. So his ratings are generally positive, but mixed views towards the US are also generally positive in the last year \u2026 due to \u2026 some of the soft power aspects \u2013 American technology, entertainment, universities, and the military are also all seen very strongly\u201d.\n\n\u201cJust to get Trump\u2019s finger off the trigger is a great relief to the world,\u201d Ms Engelmore says. \u201cI think that because he\u2019s still in the wings, he still might become president, there\u2019s still a lot of trepidation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe US is still very much like an episode of Veep, but not in such a dangerous way. Biden is delightfully boring, which is exactly what you would want from someone with so much power,\u201d Ms Pearson adds.\n\nBut much like Americans living through this election cycle in the US, the expats are all disappointed that there\u2019s no younger blood in the wings.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very disappointed with Biden \u2013 he told us that he would be sort of the bridge president into the next generation \u2026 And he did nothing to elevate any younger potential candidates,\u201d Ms Engelmore says. \u201cI think he should have he should have elevated someone else and then back them.\u201d\n\nThe rise of \u201cmiddle-finger politics\u201d may not be unique to the US but it\u2019s possibly more pronounced compared to other western nations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s less polarizing here,\u201d Ms Fitsimmons says of the UK. \u201cI could sit in a room with someone who voted Conservative and someone who voted Labour and they can have a polite conversation. Whereas I feel like in the US, it\u2019s become a lot more polarized, and people of different views can\u2019t have a functional conversation anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cCanada is a much more collectivist country,\u201d Ms Engelmore says. \u201cVancouver came through the pandemic much better than the cities in the states that I was in \u2013 people generally do what their government tells them to do.\u201d\n\nBut she adds that the US has a massive cultural influence in Canada: \u201cWhen I first got here, there were people that were waving Canadian flags off their cars. That is not something I saw before. And the trucker rallies, the gatherings of anti-vaxxers, and conspiracy theorists on corners. All of that feels new, and it feels a little Trumpy.\u201d\n\nMs Pearson says \u201cI think that there\u2019s been a reckoning with a lot of Americans in the past eight years and \u2026 there is this acceptance that America is not the greatest country. It has never really been. There are a lot of things to be proud of about America, but none have happened within the past 10 years.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s America was almost theatrically scary, almost like a bad 80s movie, like he\u2019s an evil politician from a low-budget film. But now that I have a son, everything has changed,\u201d she adds.\n\n\u201cIs this really what we have to offer? Are we really the loudest? Do we really have anything to say?\u201d\n\nHow the US can improve its image\n\nViews of the US rebounded somewhat after Mr Biden came into office, following the close-to-historic lows during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIn Pew\u2019s 2023 survey of 23 countries, a median of 59 per cent said they had a positive view of the US in 2024.\n\n\u201cI honestly think it probably would be through the figureheads,\u201d Ms Fitsimmons says, when asked how the US can improve its image abroad. \u201cAnd through laws changing. I think people can\u2019t even put their heads around something like gun control not being a thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it does have to do a lot with the person who\u2019s in power, because that\u2019s kind of the way in \u2026 And also people just spending time with Americans in America to know that the people are not the government,\u201d she adds.\n\n\u201cViews towards Trump were a lot lower in the western European countries relative to the eastern European countries, which probably means that, for example, Poland, a country that we\u2019ve surveyed, since \u2026 2005, was actually one of the countries that had relatively positive views of the US during the Bush administration,\u201d Mr Pouschter says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of positive feelings towards the US in eastern Europe, especially in Poland and that\u2019s continued throughout the administrations.\u201d\n\nHe goes on to note that eastern Europeans\u2019 experience during the Cold War and the subsequent NATO expansion to the east has helped keep views of the US mainly positive, regardless of who\u2019s in the White House.\n\n\u201cGermany is a country that swung quite wildly between negative views of Bush, high views of Obama, negative views of Trump, high views of Biden. So I think there is a little more awareness about the American political system in western Europe,\u201d Mr Pouschter says. \u201cThat leads to more changes \u2013 if there\u2019s a change in the presidency\u201d there can be \u201cpretty wild swings in US image and confidence in the US president based on who\u2019s in the presidency\u201d.\n\nMs Engelmore says she hopes the US can rein in social media companies, something which may improve views of the US abroad. With a looming possible ban on TikTok, she may get her wish.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got really mixed feelings about government censorship,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think the truth is that the kind of misinformation and conspiracy theories that are affecting the US are affecting the rest of the world. If the US could do something to counter that, that would be a huge relief.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think of how careless [Mr Trump] is trying to instigate wars on social media, how reckless he is with the lives of 300 million people and everything just seems scarier now with him being in power and everything seems a little bit more finite,\u201d Ms Pearson adds. \u201cHere he is, with all of his legal issues, with all of his money tied up \u2026 It\u2019s just very scary to see that people continue to support him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a testament to American culture, but it\u2019s also a testament to how broken the system is,\u201d she adds. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t even be able to get a job working \u2026 as a bank teller, but he can run for public office.\n\n\u201cAmerica will always continue to be a superpower. I don\u2019t see that ending anytime soon. But public opinion, our reputation \u2013 I don\u2019t even think four more years of Biden will fix that.\u201d",

        "text": "Who Watches GB News?\nThe launch of GB News in the summer of 2021 was the biggest shake-up of the British TV news media market since the launch of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Sky News in 1989.\n\nThe channel has endured its share of controversies: From the acrimonious exit of its first Chairman, Andrew Neil, just months after it launched; to the sackings of presenters such as Dan Wooton and Laurence Fox; to the Ofcom investigations into potential breaches of impartiality.\n\nBut having weathered these storms, the channel now occupies an important niche in the media landscape in Britain, particularly on the conservative centre-right. It has seen off its better budgeted rival, Talk TV, and in recent filings to companies house revealed it was reaching an average of 2.7 million viewers per month in the year ending May 2023, up 17.8% on the figures from the year before.\n\nSo, who watches GB News?\n\nTo answer this, and other, questions, we at Redfield & Wilton Strategies recently asked a representative sample of 4,000 voters across Great Britain about their media consumption habits.\n\nFor starters, 10% of the total sample name GB News as one of the television news channels that they would typically use for news. That places the channel ahead of international competitors like RT (1%), CNN International (5%), and Al Jazeera (6%), but behind domestic competitors, including Sky (29%), ITV (40%), and the BBC (62%).\n\nWhen drilling deeper into the numbers to see the make-up of GB News viewership, we find that, when broken down by gender, men account for 62% of those who say they typically use the station for news, while women make-up 38% of those who typically watch the channel.\n\nWhen broken down by age, the figures show that 47% of those who say they typically use GB News are aged either 55-64 (21%) or 65+ (26%), while only 9% of those who typically use the channel are aged 18-24.\n\nIn terms of regional variation, 16% of those who say they typically use GB News for news are based in London, 15% in the North West and 14% in the West Midlands.\n\nA further 12% live in the South East of England.\n\nWhen broken down by how they voted in the last General Election, 51% of those who say they typically use GB News for news voted Conservative at the last General Election, while 22% voted for Labour.\n\nA further 12% of those who typically use GB News did not vote in the 2019 General Election.\n\nLooking ahead to the coming General Election, 38% of those who typically use GB News now intend to vote for Reform UK at the next election, making it the most popular party among GB News viewers. 25% of this cohort are likely to vote Conservative at the next election and 17% for Labour.\n\nThe 2016 referendum on EU membership provides another clear indicator of the character of GB News\u2019 viewership.\n\n63% of those who typically use the channel for news voted to Leave in 2016, while 26% voted Remain.\n\nA further 11% did not vote in 2016.\n\nWhen broken down by self-declared social class, 51% of those who name GB News as a channel they typically use for news say they are working class.\n\n41% say they are middle class and an additional 5% say they are upper class. Those figures are in-line with each cohort\u2019s share of the overall population.\n\n58% of those who typically use GB News for news say they own their own home. 33% live in rented accommodation, and 7% live in their family home.\n\nAmong those who typically use GB News and who say they own their own home, 55% had a mortgage which they have paid off, 26% have a mortgage which they are currently paying off, and 19% have never had a mortgage on their home.\n\nOther social barometers provide interesting insights into the nature of GB News viewership.\n\n32% of those who say they typically use GB News enjoy beer as their alcoholic drink of choice, while 27% prefer wine. A further 13% are spirit drinkers.\n\nAmong those who pick beer as their alcoholic drink of choice, 59% name Lager as their beer type of choice, against 33% who pick ale, and 7% stout.\n\nRespondents who say they typically use GB News for news are more likely than members of the overall population to class themselves as football fans.\n\nWhile 33% of the overall population say they are \u2018absolutely\u2019 a football fan, that number rises to 47% among those who typically watch GB News. 27% of Britons say they are \u2018somewhat\u2019 football fans, against 29% of those who typically use GB News.\n\nAnd while 40% of Britons answer \u2018No, not at all\u2019 when asked if they consider themselves a football fan, that number falls to 24% among those who typically watch GB News.\n\nFinally, GB News viewers are far more likely to be fans of Marmite than the overall population.\n\nWhile a majority (53%) of Britons say they do not like marmite, against 38% who say they do, a plurality of those who typically watch GB News (49%) say they are fans of the savoury spread, against 39% of this group who say they are not.\n\nIn summary, our findings are that those most likely to be GB news viewers are men; those aged 55 and older; and living in London or the North-East or West Midlands of England.\n\nThose who voted in Leave in 2016 are also more likely to be GB News viewers, as are those who intend to vote Reform at the next election, although more liberal and left-leaning voters also watch the channel.\n\nGB News viewers tend to also be working class, are more likely to be beer drinkers than non-beer drinks, and are more likely to declare themselves to be football fans than the general population of Britain.",

        "text": "12 candidates seek open U.S. House seat for Montana's eastern congressional district\nU.S. Rep. Matt Rosendale's decision not to seek reelection has led to the most crowded race in Montana's primary this year: 12 candidates \u2013 eight Republicans and four Democrats \u2013 running for U.S. House in the state's 2nd Congressional District, which covers much of central and eastern Montana, including Billings, Great Falls and Helena.\n\nMTN interviewed all of the candidates to find out more about their priorities and how they're trying to differentiate themselves from the rest of the field.\n\nRepublican Candidates:\n\nMTN News\n\nSuperintendent of Public Instruction Elsie Arntzen, a native of Billings, says voters in the 2nd Congressional District are looking for a candidate who's conservative not only on fiscal issues, but cultural ones as well.\n\nMTN News\n\nPharm406 pharmacy owner Kyle Austin, of Billings, ran against Rosendale in the 2022 House primary, and he says he wants to operate differently if he's elected to Congress.\n\nMTN News\n\nMontana Senate President Pro Tem Sen. Ken Bogner, of Miles City, says he's championed issues like security in the Legislature, and he wants to bring them to the federal level.\n\nMTN News\n\nState Auditor Troy Downing says he's had a record in business, in the military and in his current office that makes him the strongest Republican candidate for the 2nd District.\n\nMTN News\n\nFormer state Sen. Ric Holden, of Dawson County, says he wants to give Montana farmers and ranchers a voice in Congress, and he's taking the message to voters face to face.\n\nMTN News\n\nAttorney and former state Rep. Joel Krautter, of Billlings, stands out in the Republican field as the only candidate who says he won't vote for former President Donald Trump in 2024.\n\nMTN News\n\nFormer U.S. Rep. Denny Rehberg, of Billings, is touting his experience representing Montana in Congress for more than a decade as what sets him apart in this race.\n\nMTN News\n\nFormer DEA agent Stacy Zinn, of Billings, says she spent her career tackling cartels and terrorists, and she wants to bring that unique background to Congress.\n\nA ninth candidate will appear on the Republican ballot, but is no longer actively campaigning. Former state Sen. Ed Walker of Billings announced he was ending his campaign last month.\n\nDemocratic Candidates:\n\nMTN News\n\nFormer pharmaceutical sales representative Ming Cabrera, of Billings, says he faces a big challenge in an area that has long voted Republican, but he'll try to reach voters one person at a time.\n\nMTN News\n\nFormer Public Service Commissioner John Driscoll, of Helena, has one clear difference from his fellow candidates \u2013 he says he\u2019s refusing to raise money for campaigning.\n\nMTN News\n\nMontana Pride president and business owner Kevin Hamm, of Helena, says he brings voters something they won't get from other candidates, and he's touting that authenticity.\n\nMTN News\n\nRancher and business owner Steve Held, of Broadus, says he never registered with a party before deciding to join this race, and he believes there's still room for common ground.",

Election spending for the 2020 presidential election topped more than $14 billion .",
        "text": "Why U.S. election campaigns feel so long\nFor more politics coverage and analysis, sign up for Here\u2019s the Deal, our weekly politics newsletter, here.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has now been campaigning for reelection for a year, and former President Donald Trump has been running since he announced his new presidential campaign shortly after the 2022 midterms.\n\nElection Day is a little more than six months away (we\u2019ll hit that milestone on Sunday). Most Americans say the recent presidential campaigns have not focused on the right issues and \u201clasted too long,\u201d according to a 2023 poll by Pew Research Center survey.\n\nIt can feel like U.S. presidential election cycles stretch on forever, but are they actually longer than in other countries?\n\nYou can measure that in a few ways.\n\nLook at the calendar\n\nWhile it\u2019s difficult to compare the length of campaigns between democracies, some do have short, official election periods:\n\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s campaign lasts 25 days\n\nMexico\u2019s election season formally began March 1 and will end three months later (More on this below)\n\nTrump, in contrast, announced his second run for the White House a week after the 2022 midterms, about 720 days \u2014 just shy of two years \u2014 before the 2024 presidential election\n\nThe fundraising factor\n\nOfficial announcements are the start of public campaigns. But when you think about a U.S. presidential race, there\u2019s also a set of \u201csub-campaigns,\u201d said John Geer, a political science professor at Vanderbilt University.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the public campaign where you seek votes,\u201d he said, \u201cbut any candidate is also going to engage in a fundraising campaign where they\u2019re raising money, they\u2019re going to try to campaign for support of party leaders and activists, and also, frankly, the support of journalists to get as favorable coverage as possible.\u201d\n\nRecent U.S. elections are also expensive. Election spending for the 2020 presidential election topped more than $14 billion, surpassing the record-breaking 2016 White House race. That included $5.7 billion for the presidential campaigns and another $8.7 billion spent on congressional races, according to U.S. nonprofit Open Secrets.\n\nBut vast amounts of election cash do not always correlate to longer elections.\n\nREAD MORE: Majority of Americans aren\u2019t paying attention to Trump\u2019s hush money trial, poll finds\n\nMilan\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Vaishnav, director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that while India\u2019s general election, currently underway, will last 44 days, it may end up becoming the world\u2019s most expensive in recent history. That election is estimated to cost around $8 billion.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of money being spent in a relatively short amount of time, and on all the high-tech aspects of campaigning,\u201d like digital media buys, advertisements, and posters, he said.\n\nCalling Indian elections a \u201ccontact sport,\u201d Vaishnav said politicians work around the clock for support during the short, official election period and will spend funds in the final days on giveaways, such as alcohol, bricks for homes or even simply cash.\n\nWas it always this way?\n\nGeer said that in the early 19th century, travel made it difficult to campaign across the country and so local surrogates were more important. For President William McKinley, that meant running a \u201cfront-porch campaign\u201d in 1896. As in, he sat on his front porch in Ohio and let surrogates speak for him, Geer said.\n\nThe main goal was getting the approval of party elites. Primaries were not as important, Geer added.\n\nThat began to change after World War II, most notoriously at the 1968 Democratic National Convention, when Vice President Hubert Humphrey was controversially selected as the nominee although he did not compete in the primaries and won a minority of the delegates.",

(Harrison McClary/Vanderbilt)\n\nNational security experts, including Gen. Timothy Haugh, director of the NSA and Cyber Command; Sheetal Patel, assistant director, Transnational and Technology Mission Center, CIA; Anne Milgram, administrator of the DEA; and Christopher Wray, director of the FBI, documented the current political, economic, social and military dynamics between China and the United States.\n\nIn addition to private and public sector experts, Vanderbilt faculty, including Douglas Adams, retired Lt. Gen. Charlie \u201cTuna\u201d Moore, Erin Calipari, Andres Gannon and Niloofar Razi Howe, contributed their expertise. Students were also invited to attend, and they got a rare look into strategic government operations from the decision-makers themselves.\n\n\u201cThe complex, intertwined and interdependent nature of our national security today requires us to address threats with nuance, strategy and an interdisciplinary approach that recognizes how actions in one domain may affect another,\u201d Chancellor Daniel Diermeier said in his remarks opening the summit. \u201cThe kind of radical, cross-sector collaboration we need to address national security challenges is one of the things that sets Vanderbilt apart. It\u2019s part of our culture.\u201d\n\nCHINESE THREATS LOOM LARGE OVER NATIONAL SECURITY\n\n\u201cThe People\u2019s Republic of China represents the defining threat of this generation and this era. There is no country that presents a broader, more comprehensive threat to our ideas, our innovation, our economic security and our national security.\u201d \u2014Christopher Wray, director, FBI\n\nThe third annual Summit on Modern Conflict and Emerging Threats offered a deep examination of China\u2019s history, economy, technology, military readiness and supply chain, and its increasingly dissatisfied people, and revealed the complexity of the problem:\n\nUnbound by international norms, China\u2019s formidable cyber forces have become a persistent threat. For decades, they have targeted every major U.S. industry, hacking thousands of companies and government organizations. This relentless campaign has resulted in the theft of intellectual property across diverse sectors\u2014from technology and pharmaceuticals to energy, utilities and communication.\n\nChina has developed new international payment systems that bypass the need for a SWIFT ID code and have become the largest money launderers in the world.\n\nChina has invested heavily in space capabilities, developing myriad attack platforms, including direct descent missiles that can strike U.S. satellites.\n\nChina makes the vast majority of the precursor chemicals necessary to make fentanyl, which they send to Mexico to become illegal pills that kill more than 100,000 Americans each year.\n\nCOLLABORATION IS THE MOST CRITICAL ASSET OF OUR NATIONAL SECURITY\n\n\u201cThe broad collaboration toward a common purpose is a principal advantage in contesting China \u2026 [that will] allow us to achieve agility, scale and capabilities that would not otherwise be available to us.\u201d \u2014Gen. Timothy Haugh, director, NSA\n\nDespite sobering assessments of China\u2019s capabilities and U.S. vulnerabilities, a wave of optimism surged through the summit. Each presenter documented methods for combating China\u2019s threats, and a common thread emerged: collaboration. The stifling information silos and agency rivalries of the past are gone, replaced by a contagious spirit of collective action.\n\nThe first day of the summit crackled with an electric sense of synergy. While national security experts from a wide range of agencies and military\u2014NSA, FBI, CISA, CIA, DARPA, DOD, the Cyber National Mission Force, Marines, Army, National Guard, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Vanderbilt University and even private sector companies\u2014took the stage, the audience quickly recognized the vast potential for collaboration among the participants. By lunchtime, the room buzzed with attendees actively networking and seeking out opportunities to work together.\n\nMaj. Gen.

(Harrison McClary/Vanderbilt)\n\nCYBERSECURITY THREATS FROM CHINA JEOPARDIZE AMERICAN INDUSTRIES\n\n\u201cOur national security is directly tied to our economic security and at the heart of economic security is the health and protection of technological innovation.\u201d \u2014Sheetal Patel, assistant director, Transnational and Technology Mission Center, CIA\n\nAccording to intelligence experts, China has been stealing information from America and its allies since at least the 1980s. \u201cThe People\u2019s Republic of China is engaged in the largest and most sophisticated theft of intellectual property and expertise in the history of the world by leveraging its most powerful weapons, starting with cyber,\u201d Wray said.\n\nIn fact, China\u2019s hacking program is larger than that of every other major nation combined. Cybersecurity threats like theft of intellectual property, supply chain disruption and disinformation campaigns are all dangerous, but according to experts, the greatest threat to our national security is attacks on key infrastructure like power, water and communications systems.\n\nAI OFFERS COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE TO FIRST MOVERS\n\n\u201cThe country that puts generative AI on their data first will win.\u201d \u2014Sheetal Patel, assistant director, Transnational and Technology Mission Center, CIA\n\nArtificial intelligence sparked frequent debate at the summit about its double-edged nature. AI for example, has enabled the development of nuclear and biological weapons by nonfriendly actors, but it also has helped the U.S. identify and prevent attacks at home and among our allies like Taiwan and Ukraine.\n\nPatel said that the challenge for America and its allies is that China does not play by the same rules that govern us. \u201cWe could build the guardrails for AI and how to use it, and we are going to build it and make sure we use it ethically, but the People\u2019s Republic of China and our other adversaries don\u2019t have to follow suit.\u201d\n\nHaugh believes that the fate of all nations depends on our ability to adapt: \u201cIt is no longer that the big eat the small. Now that the fast eat the slow \u2026 the advantage will go to those that see first, recognize first, adapt first and apply first.\u201d\u201d\n\nTHREAT OF FOREIGN INTERFERENCE LOOMS OVER U.S. ELECTION\n\n\u201cWe fully expect in this election cycle to see more foreign adversaries using modern technology at a faster clip than we have in prior elections. These adversaries are finding diverse ways to pit Americans against each other, amplify controversial topics and undermine confidence in our electoral system.\u201d \u2014Christopher Wray, director, FBI\n\nAccording to national security experts, technology\u2014and particularly artificial intelligence\u2014will be leveraged at unprecedented rates to disrupt and influence the 2024 presidential election in the United States. \u201cAI has the ability to create and spread disinformation,\u201d Patel said. \u201cGenerative AI applications could be used by our adversaries to develop synthetic content and influence public opinion in ways that undermine U.S. interests.\u201d\n\nThe 2024 U.S. presidential election is expected to be one of the costliest and fiercest battles in American history. Instances of \u201csynthetic content,\u201d or deep fakes featuring President Joe Biden, have already surfaced in this electoral cycle, including a deceptive video during the New Hampshire Democratic primary and robocalls using an AI-generated voice.\n\nCHINA HAS WEAPONIZED FENTANYL WITH DEADLY EFFECT\n\n\u201cFor almost three years, I have talked about fentanyl as the deadliest drug threat that the United States has ever seen, but today I would tell you it is the most urgent and deadly threat, period, that we are facing.\u201d \u2014Anne Milgram, administrator, DEA\n\nWhile fentanyl might be an unexpected subject at a national security summit about China, Milgram said that China supplies Mexico with all the chemicals necessary to make the dangerous, deadly drug. Hundreds of millions of fentanyl pills are then carried over the U.S. border and sold as Oxycontin, Adderall, Percocet and Xanax.\n\nIn recent years, the potency of fentanyl has skyrocketed, intensifying its threat. DEA estimates reveal that a striking seven out of 10 doses entering the United States are fatal. In just the past year, American law enforcement seized over 400 million doses, and most of them trace back to Mexico. This relentless assault on the U.S. borders and populace is alarming: Every 11 days, more people die from drug poisoning in the U.S. than the cumulative fatalities of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\n\nMUTUAL TRUST AND RESPECT ACCELERATES THE ART OF THE POSSIBLE\n\n\u201cIt matters that we spark open and hopefully ongoing conversations among national security leaders who spend their days facing down real-world security threats, faculty members with unparalleled depth of knowledge in their fields, and industry experts whose companies sit on the front lines of our interactions with China.\u201d \u2014Daniel Diermeier, chancellor, Vanderbilt University\n\nAttendees of the 2024 Summit on Modern Conflict and Emerging Threats identified best practices for countering China:\n\nCollaborate broadly. The NSA established the Cybersecurity Collaboration Center and created partnerships with more than 1,000 public and private entities. Through the issuance of numerous unclassified cybersecurity advisories, the CCC outlines adversaries\u2019 attacks and the vulnerabilities they target. These advisories help governments and private industries worldwide safeguard their data.\n\nImprove security processes. In the infamous \u201cSolarWinds\u201d hack in 2020, the Russians implanted malicious code within software for IT resource management. Subsequently, when the company released a software update, it unknowingly disseminated compromised code, providing Russia with a back door to install malware for spying. Consequently, the U.S. government swiftly enacted multi-factor authentication, phishing-resistant technology across all agencies and services.\n\nMake information widely available. The DEA formed counter-threat teams of agents, analysts, data scientists, chemists and financial experts that transformed DEA technology systems. Now every agent in its 334 offices worldwide has access to all DEA data, ensuring that they have the comprehensive information necessary to detect and combat illegal drug trafficking on a global level.\n\nInvest in American technological development. Jamil Jeffers, a venture investor and a partner at Mercer, shared a recent collaboration with nine other venture capital firms that have agreed not to invest in adversary technology. \u201cWe are going to invest in American capabilities and technology to \u2018build secure by design, and build resilient by data,\u2019\u201d Jeffers said. Jeffers believes that this type of effort is crucial if America is to lessen its dependence on trade with China.\n\nVANDERBILT TO LAUNCH NEW INSTITUTE DEDICATED TO NATIONAL SECURITY\n\nVanderbilt University will also expand its collaboration by investing in national security scholarship and research with the formation of the Institute of National Security. \u201cThis institute will help us deliver world-changing solutions to the kinds of challenges we\u2019re discussing here\u2014all at the speed of modern conflict,\u201d Diermeier said.\n\nThe Institute of National Security, which plans a launch later this year, will be built upon the same four interrelated pillars that guide all scholarly work at Vanderbilt: Its purpose will be to accelerate innovation by working closely with government, military and private sector companies to create solutions with users and for users; educate service-minded students and the national security workforce about trends, tools, policies, data and processes they need to protect democracy around the world; convene national security and intelligence thought-leaders and practitioners to discuss, dissect and deliberate the most consequential national security problems in the U.S. and abroad; and leverage expertise among faculty and students to advise national security leaders on classified and unclassified security-focused programs.\n\n\u201cWe live in a dramatically changing world where no entity working in isolation will have all that is required to respond to emerging threats,\u201d Haugh concluded. \u201cTherefore, advantage will go to those best postured to work in collaboration with others. Accelerating technology change creates a rapidly expanding art of the possible.\u201d\n\nThis article was updated to reflect a change in the name of the Institute of National Security.",

        "text": "As Biden and Trump seek reelection, who are the oldest \u2013 and youngest \u2013 current world leaders?\nJoe Biden, at 81, is the oldest American president, a distinction he\u2019s held since entering office at age 78. As Biden runs for reelection in 2024, he is the ninth oldest national leader in the world, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of sitting leaders in 187 United Nations member states.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, who is running for the White House again this year, is younger than Biden. But at 77, Trump also falls among the 20 oldest world leaders when compared with those currently in power.\n\nHow we did this With current U.S. President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump both running for reelection to the country\u2019s highest office, Pew Research Center examined the ages of current national leaders to place the ages of Biden and Trump into a global context. This analysis examines the ages of the current heads of government in 187 countries that are member states of the United Nations, relying on government biographies and regional news articles. It reflects the ages of national leaders \u2013 and in a few instances, acting or interim leaders \u2013 as of May 1, 2024. It excludes six UN member states for which an exact birth date of the leader could not be found: Afghanistan, Haiti, Iraq, Mali, Niger and Somalia. For each of these countries, we reached out to embassy officials in the United States but did not receive further information. This analysis focuses mostly on heads of government as defined by a country\u2019s political system or constitution. In some cases, we determined the national leader based on which executive has the power to appoint/dismiss the nominal head of government. In San Marino, where there are two captains regent who share power, we included data for Alessandro Rossi, as he assumed the position most recently. This analysis also draws on Freedom House country rankings to determine whether countries are free, partly free or not free. These rankings are based on two numerical scores assigned to each country for its political rights and civil liberties. The median age of each country\u2019s overall population is a 2024 projection from the UN\u2019s World Population Prospects 2022 report. The projections are based on \u201call available sources of data on population size and levels of fertility, mortality and international migration.\u201d\n\nAmerican voters are skeptical about both candidates\u2019 fitness for the job, according to a recent Center survey. Only about four-in-ten U.S. registered voters are extremely or very confident that Trump has the mental fitness to be president (38%), while a similar share are confident in his physical fitness (36%). Even fewer express this degree of confidence in Biden\u2019s mental (21%) and physical (15%) fitness for the role.\n\nBelow are five key facts about the ages of current national leaders.\n\nNational leaders range in age from their mid-30s to 91. The youngest leader is Burkina Faso\u2019s Ibrahim Traor\u00e9, who is 36. He only slightly edges out two fellow 36-year-olds, Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa and Montenegrin Prime Minister Milojko Spaji\u0107. Only two other world leaders are in their 30s: Irish Taoiseach Simon Harris and Chilean President Gabriel Boric.\n\nThe oldest national leader is President Paul Biya of Cameroon, who was born in 1933 and took office more than 40 years ago. Biya is the only current national leader in his 90s.\n\nThe median age of current national leaders is 62, as of May 1, 2024. The largest share of global leaders today (34%) are in their 60s. Roughly a quarter (22%) are in their 50s; 19% are in their 70s; and 16% are in their 40s. Biden is among the 5% of leaders who are in their 80s.\n\nCountries that are less free tend to have older leaders. In countries that Freedom House classifies as \u201cnot free,\u201d the median age of the national leader is 68. That compares with 62 in countries that are classified as \u201cpartly free\u201d and 60 in countries classified as \u201cfree.\u201d\n\nThe United States is one of only three countries that are classified as free and have a leader age 80 or older; the other two are Ghana and Namibia. In Ghana, President Nana Akufo-Addo recently turned 80 in office. And in Namibia, 82-year-old Nangolo Mbumba took over as president earlier this year following the previous leader\u2019s death in office at age 82.\n\nThe median age for women leaders and men leaders is the same. Among men who are world leaders, 3% are in their 30s, while no women leaders are in this age group. Yet, of the 14 women leaders currently in power, 29% are in their 40s, compared with 14% of leaders who are men.\n\nPrime Minister Mette Frederiksen of Denmark is the youngest female leader at 46, followed closely by fellow 46-year-old Kaja Kallas, the prime minister of Estonia. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh is the oldest female leader at 76.\n\nIn most countries, the leader is significantly older than the median member of the population. For example, the median American is 38, according to UN population projections for 2024, while Biden is more than twice as old. In fact, the only countries that have a leader who is younger than the median resident of the country are Montenegro, Ireland and Italy. Andorran Prime Minister Xavier Espot Zamora, at 44, is the same age as the median Andorran resident.\n\nIn general, countries that Freedom House classifies as free are more likely than those classified as partly free or not free to have leaders who are closer in age to the median resident of the country.\n\nNote: This is an update of a post originally published on March 24, 2023.",

        "text": "Trump says he will only accept 2024 election results \u2018if everything\u2019s honest\u2019\nCNN \u2014\n\nFormer President Donald Trump refused to unconditionally accept the results of the upcoming 2024 presidential election in an interview Wednesday with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n\n\u201cIf everything\u2019s honest, I\u2019ll gladly accept the results. I don\u2019t change on that,\u201d Trump said in the interview. \u201cIf it\u2019s not, you have to fight for the right of the country.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the latest comment by Trump in which he has sought to undermine confidence in the American electoral system in the event he loses in November. In the interview, he also repeated false claims that he won the state of Wisconsin during the 2020 election and cast doubt on whether ballots will be counted \u201chonestly.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you go back and look at all of the things that had been found out, it showed that I won the election in Wisconsin,\u201d Trump told the Journal Sentinel. \u201cIt also showed I won the election in other locations.\u201d\n\nPresident Joe Biden won Wisconsin in 2020, coming out ahead by about 21,000 votes \u2013 a victory of about 0.6 percentage points.\n\nTrump said he would \u201clet it be known\u201d if he thought the 2024 election wasn\u2019t \u201chonest,\u201d but said he anticipated it would be.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be doing a disservice to the country if I said otherwise,\u201d Trump told the Journal Sentinel. \u201cBut no, I expect an honest election and we expect to win maybe very big.\u201d\n\nTrump said, \u201cBut if everything\u2019s honest, which we anticipate it will be \u2014 a lot of changes have been made over the last few years \u2014 but if everything\u2019s honest, I will absolutely accept the results.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want people that vote to cast an honest ballot. I want the ballots to be counted honestly. I don\u2019t want people going to legislatures and getting things not approved and then doing it anyway,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe Biden campaign condemned Trump\u2019s remarks on Thursday.\n\n\u201cPresident Biden has said, \u2018You can\u2019t love your country only when you win.\u2019 But for Donald Trump, his campaign for revenge and retribution reigns supreme,\u201d the campaign said in a statement. \u201cIn his own words, he is promising to rule as a dictator on \u2018day one,\u2019 use the military against the American people, punish those who stand against him, condone violence done on his behalf, and put his own quest for power ahead of what is best for America.\n\n\u201cBottom line: Trump is a danger to the Constitution and a threat to our democracy. The American people are going to give him another electoral defeat this November because they continue to reject his extremism, his affection for violence, and his thirst for revenge.\u201d\n\nTrump has repeatedly claimed the 2020 election was rigged or \u201cstolen,\u201d despite no evidence of widespread voter fraud. Special counsel Jack Smith indicted the former president last year, alleging Trump broke several laws in his attempts to overturn the election. Trump has denied the allegations and pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges.\n\nThroughout his political career, Trump has regularly refused to accept the results of an election or commit to conceding defeat. After finishing second in the Iowa caucuses in 2016, Trump accused Texas Sen. Ted Cruz of fraud and called for a new contest. Later, while facing Democrat Hillary Clinton, Trump baselessly claimed the election he eventually won was \u201crigged\u201d and repeatedly refused to say whether he would abide by the outcome. He has again avoided a commitment heading into the 2024 election.\n\nThe presumptive Republican nominee joined House Speaker Mike Johnson for a news conference earlier this month to, in part, \u201cdraw attention to\u201d what they say are state proposals and lawsuits that would allow non-citizens to vote, CNN previously reported.\n\nCurrently, federal law bans non-citizens from voting in federal elections. Non-citizens who illegally cast ballots risk fines and face up to a year in prison and deportation. Trump, however, has routinely made false claims that Democrats want undocumented migrants to come into the country to impact the election, attempting to stoke fear around immigration and election security ahead of the November election.\n\nTrump returned to the campaign trail Wednesday for the first time since his New York criminal hush money trial began in earnest last month. The presumptive Republican nominee spent the day hosting rallies in Wisconsin and Michigan, two critical battleground states he won in 2016 but lost to Biden in 2020.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional comments.\n\nCNN\u2019s Alayna Treene, Kristen Holmes, Steve Contorno and Alison Main contributed to this report.",

        "text": "'Nostradamus' Of US Presidential Polls Makes His Prediction For 2024\nAllan Lichtman, often dubbed the \"Nostradamus of US presidential elections,\" has garnered a reputation for his uncanny ability to predict election outcomes. With a track record of accurately foreseeing nine out of the past ten US presidential elections, Mr Lichtman's methodology has earned him both acclaim and scrutiny.\n\nTo accurately predict who will occupy the Oval Office, Mr Lichtman has designed what he calls \"13 keys to the White House,\" a groundbreaking method that revolutionised election forecasting.\n\nThe keys, comprising a series of true or false questions, assess various factors, including economic performance, social stability, and incumbent charisma. Through careful analysis spanning historical data since Abraham Lincoln's era, Mr Lichtman has crafted a predictive model that transcends conventional methods used by traditional psephologists.\n\n\"I have not made a final prediction yet but I do have a model for 13 keys to the White House which have been correct since 1984 - 10 elections in a row - and the way it works is if six or more of the 13 keys go against the White House party (incumbent) they are predicted losers and if fewer than six then they are predicted winners,\" Mr Lichtman told NDTV. \"Right now a lot would have to go wrong for Joe Biden to lose this election. He's at the moment down by just two keys.\"\n\nBiden is expected to be challenged for a second time by Donald Trump who is increasingly likely to be the Republican party's face for the 2024 US Presidential elections scheduled for November. With Biden enjoying the advantages of incumbency and a relatively uncontested primary, Mr Lichtman sees formidable odds for his challenger.\n\nWhat Are The 13 Keys?\n\nDespite initial skepticism from the forecasting community, Mr Lichtman's methodology proved its worth time and again. From Ronald Reagan's re-election triumph amid economic recession to Bill Clinton's victory against George HW Bush, Mr Lichtman correctly predicted crucial poll contests in the US.\n\nThe 13 keys to the White House as designed by Mr Lichtman are as follows:\n\nParty Mandate: Post-midterm elections, the incumbent party secures more US House of Representatives seats than in the previous midterms.\n\nNomination Contest: There's no significant challenge to the incumbent party's nomination.\n\nIncumbency: The sitting president represents the incumbent party.\n\nThird-party Factor: There's no noteworthy third-party or independent campaign.\n\nShort-term Economic Stability: The economy doesn't face recession during the election period.\n\nLong-term Economic Growth: Real per capita economic growth equals or surpasses the average growth of the preceding two terms.\n\nPolicy Shift: The incumbent administration enacts major alterations in national policy.\n\nSocial Stability: There's no prolonged social unrest throughout the term.\n\nScandal-Free: The incumbent administration remains free from major scandals.\n\nForeign/Military Mishaps: No significant failures occur in foreign or military affairs under the incumbent administration.\n\nForeign/Military Triumphs: The incumbent administration achieves significant successes in foreign or military matters.\n\nIncumbent Charm: The incumbent party's candidate possesses charisma or enjoys national hero status.\n\nChallenger Appeal: The opposing party's candidate lacks charisma or national hero status.\n\nBiden vs Trump\n\nUS voters see Trump as more favourable for the economy compared to President Biden, as indicated by a recent Reuters/Ipsos survey. In this three-day poll, 41 per cent of participants favoured Trump's economic approach over Biden's, while 34 per cent favored Biden's. The remaining respondents either expressed uncertainty or felt neither candidate had a superior stance.\n\nHowever, Mr Lichtman said that early polls should be taken with a pinch of salt.\n\n\"Early polls have zero predictive value. They are momentary snapshots. for example, they say, 'If the elections were held today, this is where the candidates stand' - but the election is not being held today so polls are of not of any value for prediction. Early polls often lead you astray,\" Mr Lichtman told NDTV\n\n\"As we saw in 2016 when I had predicted Donald Trump's victory contrary to the polls. Or in 1988, when George H W Bush as late as May and June of the election year was 17 points behind his opponent Mike Dukakis and went on to win with a 25-point swing. That's why I tell everyone, to get the polls, to get the pundits keep your eye on the big picture as gauged by the keys,\" he added.\n\nMr Lichtman's predictive prowess faced its most significant test in the tumultuous 2000 election between Al Gore and George W Bush. While he forecasted a victory for Gore, the controversial outcome cast a shadow over his prediction.",

Sautter III Center for Strategic Communication in the School of Communication and Media at Montclair State University shows more than 75% of Gen Z have shared negative sentiment on social media surrounding the 2024 Presidential election, with emotions driven specifically by sadness (41%), disgust (27%), and anger (9%).\n\nThe study was authored by Dr. Yi Luo, Dr. Jin-A Choi, and Dr. Bond Benton by combing more than one million social media conversations from or targeted at Gen-Z social media users starting February 1 through April 7, 2024. The team used search terms including \u201c2024 voting,\u201d \u201c2024 election,\u201d and \u201c2024 presidential election.\u201d The data were contributed by 58% male and 42% female X users. Notably, this period witnessed a staggering 36,000% increase of social conversations related to Gen-Z and the 2024 presidential election compared to the previous two months.\n\n\u201cThe amount of negativity from Gen Z was eye-opening\u201d said Dr. Jin-A Choi, Assistant Professor at Montclair and Director of Data Analytics for the Center for Strategic Communication. \u201cHowever, it would not be surprising to see the negativity increase over the summer as each party\u2019s nominations become official and as we draw closer to the Presidential election in November.\u201d\n\nThe following Gen Z emotions were most prevalent in the study:\n\nSadness (41%). Feelings of helplessness and dejection dominated the negative sentiment from Gen Zs on social media, highlighted by sorrow over the Supreme Court\u2019s decision on abortion rights, the momentum of Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy, current economic impact (e.g., surging food prices, rising inflation rates, etc.) of the Biden administration, and doubts about President Biden\u2019s mental wellness. Notably, a second strong wave of sadness emerged right after Biden\u2019s State of the Union speech on March 8.\n\nDisgust (27%). Disgust, accounting for nearly one third of the emotions identified on social conversations, revealed Gen Z\u2019s feelings over a series of sociopolitical issues, including legal rights among the trans community, restricted abortion rights, classified document mismanagement by Presidents Biden and Trump, mental as well as physical wellness for Democratic and Republican\u2019s presidential candidates, and enforcement of border policies.\n\nAnger (9%). The outrage exhibited on social media appears to shift with the evolving Israel-Hamas war. Specifically, social media users vented strong fury against the Biden administration\u2019s support and funding violence in Rafah, explicitly calling it \u201ca genocide.\u201d\n\nStaying Hopeful: A more promising and positive theme emerged as Gen Z social media users were urging others to ignore polling results and to instead focus on voting and to exercise that Constitutional right.\n\nOther Key Findings: Social conversations championing women\u2019s rights jumped 74% in the observation period, including a staggering 93% increase of social chats about humanitarian aid, food assistance, opening aid corridors, and women as well as girls\u2019 rights in Gaza.\n\n\u201cThe data show that Gen Z social media users are understandably emotional about a number of issues,\u201d said Dr. Luo. \u201cThere are many existing hot-button issues and undoubtedly new ones will emerge that will shape how Gen Z feels and acts surrounding this historic Presidential election.\u201d\n\nThe full study, which can be found here, is the sixteenth from the Center of Strategic Communication, which provides social media analytics tools and training for faculty and students for classroom learning and research projects.\n\n###\n\nAbout the School of Communication and Media: The School of Communication and Media offers a range of dynamic programs in communication and media to a talented and diverse student population of over 1,800.

However, the report says user engagement \u2014 such as likes, views and shares \u2014 on their posts has been much higher on TikTok than on either Telegram or X.\n\n\u201cThe use of TikTok highlights a growing, but still not fully realized, avenue for Russia\u2019s state-backed information apparatus to reach new, young audiences,\u201d reads the report, which drew data from 70 different state-affiliated accounts and was authored by Valerie Wirtschafter, a Brookings fellow in foreign policy and its artificial intelligence initiative.\n\nThe study notes that most posts do not focus on U.S. politics but other issues, like the war in Ukraine and NATO. However, those that do tend to feature more divisive topics like U.S. policy on Israel and Russia, and questions around President Joe Biden\u2019s age, the Brookings report says.\n\nA TikTok spokesperson said the company has removed covert influence operations in the past and eliminated accounts, including 13 networks operating from Russia.\n\nThe spokesperson said TikTok also labels state-controlled media accounts and will expand that policy in the coming weeks \u201cto further address accounts that attempt to reach communities outside their home country on current global events and affairs.\u201d\n\nThe Brookings report comes after Biden last month signed legislation forcing TikTok\u2019s parent company \u2014 China-based ByteDance \u2014 to sell the platform or face a ban in the U.S. The potential ban is expected to face legal challenges.",

That\u2019s compared to 37% during the same period of time in 2023.\n\nMehta noted that after the previous presidential election there was unrest in the country which included the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol building.\n\n\u201cWhen you think about just the rhetoric and the onslaught of news and the language that\u2019s being used, we\u2019ve got to consider that this is sort of new territory that we\u2019re in,\u201d Mehta said. It\u2019s very difficult to cope when you really don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\nFor those who feel the election is causing them stress or has them even losing sleep, Mehta recommended taking some steps away from the constant stream of information and going on a \u201cmedia diet.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou cannot get a break from this because it\u2019s on your phone, social media, the TV and it\u2019s what people are talking about,\u201d Mehta said. \u201cTo really get some distance from it, you need to be very intentional.\u201d\n\nThe annual APA mental health poll was conducted through online interviews from April 9 to 11 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.\n\n\u201cLiving in a world of constant news of global and local turmoil, some anxiety is natural and expected,\u201d said APA president Petros Levounis. \u201cWhat stands out here is that Americans are reporting more anxious feelings than in past years.\u201d\n\nLevounis said the increase is likely due to \u201cthe unprecedented exposure that we have to everything that happens in the world around us.\u201d\n\nGet breaking news and daily headlines delivered to your email inbox by signing up here.\n\n\u00a9 2024 WTOP.

        "text": "Can you trust 2024 election polls on Donald Trump and Joe Biden? Here's how to cut through the noise.\nLove them or hate them, political polls aren\u2019t going anywhere. As the 2024 presidential election kicks into high gear, the internet will be flooded with surveys tracking the horserace between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump.\n\nKeeping track of the numbers can be daunting: Who's ahead in national polls? Who's ahead in state-level surveys? Figuring out which numbers to pay attention to \u2013 and whether any of it actually matters \u2013 can be even more challenging.\n\nLuckily, the USA TODAY Network has got you covered. Here\u2019s a refresher on why polls matter, whether you can trust them and what to look out for this year.\n\nWhat do polls tell us about the election?\n\nThink of polls as quick snapshots rather than crystal ball readings.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nThey don\u2019t necessarily predict the results of an election. Rather, they\u2019re used to gauge how people feel about a race during a specific period. Pollsters may ask questions about the future, but surveys have more to say about the voters' current temperature.\n\nPolls also tend to have a short shelf life. Public opinion can shift quickly, meaning that the results of polls are often only a reliable measure of the state of a race during the time they were taken.\n\nA survey taken two months ago won\u2019t reflect the state of a race today, and a poll fielded tomorrow won\u2019t tell us who is going to win the presidential election in November.\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean polls captured at the beginning of a campaign cycle don't matter. The insights from early polls tease out the major issues voters are thinking about that could shape the race. They also help trace the trendlines of how a candidate is performing \u2013 whether they\u2019re gaining traction, stagnating or losing support.\n\nPollster John Zogby likened the importance of looking at early polling to checking benchmarks while trying to reach an exercise goal.\n\n\u201cAm I going to get on the scale the day before to see how I did?\u201d said Zogby. \u201cNo, I get on the scale every so often to say what am I doing? How am I doing? What am I doing right?\u201d\n\nConducting polls early in a race and often throughout the course of an election allows political scientists, journalists and the public to track trends and spot major inflection points in campaigns.\n\nBeware of two-candidate polls\n\nNot all polls are built the same. The way a survey is designed, from how questions are worded to the demographics of the participants chosen, can influence the accuracy of its results.\n\nDavid Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center, said political polls are most accurate when they replicate as closely as possible the questions and options voters will see on their ballot.\n\nFor instance, he said that polls on the 2024 presidential election should include choices beyond the two major party candidates \u2013 Trump and Biden \u2013 because most ballots will contain third-party and independent candidates who will garner some support.\n\n\u201cIf the polls only show a binary choice, between Trump or Biden, you're not getting the full picture,\u201d Paleologos said.\n\nHe pointed to close margins in critical swing states, including Wisconsin, Arizona and Georgia, during the 2020 election as an example. Trump lost in those states by fewer votes than Libertarian Party candidate Jo Jorgensen received.\n\nIf Jorgensen had not been in the race, the results in those battlegrounds, and possibly the outcome of the election nationally, could have looked markedly different, Paleologos said.\n\nThe Libertarian Party hasn\u2019t yet chosen its candidate for the 2024 election. But early polls that include the party and other independent candidates as options are likely to more accurately show how disaffected voters are looking at their options, he explained.\n\nSuffolk University and USA TODAY have a partnership collecting polling data and insights.\n\nWho's being polled?\n\nAnother factor that can impact a poll\u2019s accuracy is the sample population surveyed. Polls randomly select a small sample of people designed to represent the broader views and attitudes of a larger population. But every organization uses different methodologies to create their samples.\n\nFor instance, some election polls take the temperature of the general population, while others only include active voters or likely voters. They also may weigh demographic information, such as the ratio of Democrats to Republicans, differently.\n\nIn the 2024 race, Zogby, author of the forthcoming book \"Beyond the Horse Race: How to Read Polls and Why We Should,\" suggested that the most accurate polls include only likely voters, the pool of people already planning to cast a ballot in November.\n\n\u201cA likely voter today may not be a likely voter on October 31,\u201d Zogby said, but capturing these voters allows political scientists to better understand the Americans who will choose the next president.\n\nShould I pay attention to national polls or state surveys?\n\nPollsters were lambasted in 2016 for projecting that then-Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton would win the election over Trump.\n\nBut national polls, which are supposed to reflect the popular vote across all states, were technically right. Overall, Clinton won nearly 2.9 million more votes than Trump.\n\nSo, what went wrong? Many analysts overstated Clinton\u2019s lead in national polls, and few organizations conducted state-specific polls in former Democratic strongholds, such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, that Trump was able to capture. His wins in those states ultimately landed him the electoral college victory.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that national polls are inferior to state polls, but you should think of them differently.\n\n\u201cNational polls are more valuable to understand what the issues are impacting likely voters,\u201d Paleologos said, while state polls better represent the horserace.\n\nHe and other polling experts told USA TODAY that Biden needs to lead Trump by three to four percentage points in a national poll to be tied with the Republican in the electoral college. That's because large liberal-leaning states like California and New York tend to tilt the results of national polls in Democrats\u2019 favor, whereas the \"electoral college these days skews Republican,\" Zogby said.\n\nIn other words, a national poll showing Biden and Trump tied would tell a similar story to a swing state poll that shows Trump leading Biden by a few points. But generally, experts warn against comparing national and state surveys, which are built off of different methodologies, against one another.\n\nCan you trust the polls?\n\nMostly. Because polls are analyzing a myriad of shifting factors, they'll always have some level of uncertainty baked in, regardless of the specific election. Organizations also don\u2019t collaborate on what states they plan to poll, or when, which means there\u2019s always potential for blind spots, like in 2016.\n\nSome political observers rely on poll averages, such as a tally from Real Clear Politics. These are generally reliable, but they can miss trends.\n\nBut when interpreted properly, polls often provide an accurate portrait of the state of an election.\n\n\u201cThere are folks that will say, \u2018Oh, you missed the election by two points,\u2019\u201d Zogby said. \"Well, two points \u2013 that showed the ballpark of what was going to happen.\u201d\n\nAnd the more polls there are, the easier it is to evaluate the race.",

        "text": "NPR poll: Democrats fear fascism, and Republicans worry about a lack of values\nNPR poll: Democrats fear fascism, and Republicans worry about a lack of values\n\nThe fear factor is real in America, but Democrats and Republicans are scared for the country's future for different reasons, the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll finds.\n\nThey also believe very differently about what children who will inherit that future should be taught.\n\nLooking at this year's presidential election, the survey also found big shifts with key voter groups, along generational, racial and educational lines.\n\nIt also explored how third-party candidates and so-called \"double haters\" \u2014 who have unfavorable ratings of both President Biden and former President Donald Trump \u2014 could affect the race.\n\nFinally, it finds a jump in Republicans now believing Trump has done something unethical, as he continues to contend with dozens of criminal charges and legal troubles.\n\nFascism and extremism vs. a lack of values and becoming weak\n\nDemocrats overwhelmingly said teaching children to treat others as you would want to be treated, the \"Golden Rule,\" is the most important value to teach children. That was followed farther back by \"education being the key to success\" and \"be happy and follow your dreams.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nLoading...\n\nDemocrats are most concerned about a rise in extremism and fascism, topping everything else by a wide margin.\n\nRepublicans, on the other hand, said instilling children with faith in God, teaching them that hard work and discipline pay off, and to abide by the \"Golden Rule\" were most important.\n\nTheir biggest concerns for the country were a lack of values and becoming weak as a nation.\n\nLoading...\n\nTrump's trials have worn down Republicans, as more of them are viewing the former president as having done something wrong\n\nFewer than half of respondents said they're following Trump's New York hush money trial closely, but with the Republican primary over and Trump's continued legal troubles, a majority of Republicans now say they believe Trump has done something wrong, whether that's something unethical or illegal.\n\nThe number of Republicans saying Trump has done something unethical has jumped 12 points since February, from 34% to 46%. Still, only 8% of Republicans think he's done something illegal, compared to almost half of respondents overall (47%).\n\nA whopping 77% overall think Trump has done something illegal or at least unethical, and a majority believes the investigations into his conduct are fair.\n\nThere are big shifts since 2020 along age, race and educational lines\n\nWhen looking at the presidential election, Biden and Trump remain in a virtual tie among registered voters, with 50% for Biden and 48% for Trump. Among people who say they are \"definitely voting\" in November, Biden's lead expands out to 5 points, 52%-47%. The survey shows Biden is doing better with groups that say they're likely or definitely voting \u2014 older voters and college-educated whites, in particular.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThat may seem like the same old story \u2014 two well-known candidates who were expected to be in a close race are now in a close race. But the top line numbers mask important shifts taking place by age, race and education.\n\nHere are some key findings:\n\nAge\n\nTrump won voters older than 45 in 2020, according to exit polls, but Biden is winning them now, including having a 12-point lead with the oldest voters. That's unusual because older voters have traditionally leaned Republican.\n\nBiden won voters under 45 by double-digits in 2020, but Trump and Biden are now tied with the group. Biden is particularly struggling with the youngest voters \u2014 he's up just 2 points with Gen Z/Millennials, who are 18 to 43 years old. In 2020, though, he won 18- to 29-year-olds by 24 points, and those 30 to 44 by 6 points.\n\nRespondents aged 18 to 29 give Biden just a 31% approval rating, 10 points lower than his overall rating of 41%.\n\nRace and education\n\nBiden won nonwhite voters by 45 points in 2020, but his lead with them now is half that.\n\nHe is doing better with white voters than he did in 2020 by a few points, and that's mostly attributed to college-educated whites.\n\nBiden won college-educated white women by 9 points in 2020. This survey has him ahead by 17 with them.\n\nTrump won college-educated white men by 3 points in 2020, but now Biden is ahead by 10 points with them.\n\n\"Double haters\" are core to RFK Jr.'s support\n\nPolls have been unclear about which candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has the potential to pull support from more. This survey shows him taking a bit more from Biden than from Trump.\n\nBiden's 2-point lead with all adults and 5-point lead with registered voters evaporates when RFK Jr. and others are considered. RFK Jr. takes in 11% of the vote, which is about how much he's been registering on average in previous Marist polls and other surveys.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIt's no secret that there's a lot of cynicism and disaffection among many voters. Highlighting the country's partisanship, respondents said both men essentially represent equal threats to democracy, and majorities say they dislike both.\n\nIn this survey, 56% have an unfavorable view of Trump, and 54% have an unfavorable opinion of Biden. That's the well from which RFK Jr. is drawing.\n\nIn a matchup between Biden, Trump and RFK Jr., RFK Jr. gets 31% with those who have an unfavorable rating of both Trump and Biden, the \"double haters.\" Another 31% of the \"double haters,\" when faced with this choice, chose Trump and only 20% side with Biden.\n\nThat's a major warning sign for Biden because in 2020, Biden did well with \"double haters,\" according to Democratic pollsters. When it's just Biden against Trump, the two men are statistically tied with the group, 46% for Trump, 45% for Biden.\n\nAmong the other groups RFK Jr. gets his most support: independent women (22%), independents overall (17%), those in the West (15%), parents with children under 18 (14%), white women with college degrees (14%), those under 45 (13%) and Gen Z/Millennials.\n\nThe survey of 1,199 adults was conducted April 22-25 by the Marist Institute for Public Opinion. The margin of error for the overall sample is +/- 3.6 percentage points.",

        "text": "Candidates confront corruption and inequality in Panama\u2019s presidential race\nEight hopefuls are seeking to succeed President Laurentino Cortizo in Sunday\u2019s election, with corruption a top issue.\n\nOver the last five years, Panama has weathered the COVID-19 pandemic, paralysing nationwide protests, and a drought that has brought transportation through its famed canal to a standstill.\n\nBut on Sunday, the slender Central American country is set for a shake-up, as its latest presidential election unfolds.\n\nEight candidates are vying for the position occupied by outgoing President Laurentino Cortizo, whose office is limited to a single five-year term at a time.\n\nForemost among the presidential hopefuls is Jose Raul Mulino, a former security minister who stepped into the race to replace embattled ex-President Ricardo Martinelli.\n\nThe former president was previously the frontrunner, until a 10-year prison sentence for money laundering rendered his campaign illegal under Panamanian law.\n\nMulino, Martinelli\u2019s former running mate, now leads the race in his stead. An April poll from the research agency Gallup places him at the front of the pack, with 29 percent of the voters\u2019 support.\n\nOther contenders include an array of high-ranking government officials. Second in the running, for instance, is Mart\u00edn Torrijos, another former president, with 14 percent of voters backing him.\n\nEven the current vice president, Jos\u00e9 Gabriel Carrizo, is in the race, though opinion polls show him lagging with only 5 percent support. All but one of the candidates are considered conservative: Only economist Maribel Gord\u00f3n, a long shot, represents the left.\n\nStill, the race could be anyone\u2019s to win. Gallup found that 22 percent of voters were undecided, and the presidency will be determined in a single vote, with no run-offs.\n\nWhat are the issues shaping this year\u2019s race? Al Jazeera breaks down the voters\u2019 top concerns.\n\nGovernment corruption\n\nGallup found that corruption was the main concern driving Panamanians to the polls this election cycle, with 57 percent of respondents identifying it as the primary issue affecting the country.\n\nThe nonprofit Transparency International ranks Panama among the bottom half of all countries in its corruption index.\n\nAnd in 2015, a United Nations official estimated that the country loses 1 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) \u2014 approximately $520m \u2014 each year due to corrupt practices.\n\nPanama\u2019s Social Security Fund (CSS) is often singled out as an example. Last week, for instance, the Attorney General\u2019s Office announced the arrest of three officials from the agency after an investigation surfaced evidence of bribery.\n\n\u201cThe CSS is a financing well for corruption,\u201d economist Felipe Argote told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cThe institution is full of botellas, inefficiency and overpricing,\u201d he added, using Panamanian slang for someone who collects paycheque without working.\n\nBut while all eight presidential candidates have pledged to stamp out corruption, some have faced suspicions of malfeasance themselves.\n\nOne candidate, lawyer and former judge Zulay Rodriguez, is currently under investigation for money laundering and misappropriating 66kg (146 pounds) of gold from a client.\n\nTorrijos, meanwhile, has previously faced scrutiny for his ties to the Brazilian construction firm Odebrecht, which was accused of bribing officials across Latin America in exchange for beneficial contracts.\n\nExperts say the institutional corruption in Panama has a direct bearing on the results of the election. In a 2019 report, Transparency International estimated that 23 percent of Panamanians had been offered some form of bribe in exchange for their vote.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unusual to see a person with a campaign hat or T-shirt handing out brochures in the street who hasn\u2019t been paid,\u201d political scientist Claire Nevache told Al Jazeera.\n\nPart of the problem, she explained, stems from the wealth gap between Panamanians: Poverty drives some citizens to seek favours from politicians.\n\n\u201cPanama\u2019s great inequality fuels great patronage,\u201d Nevache said.\n\n\u201cFor many people with scarce personal networks and low education levels, the only way to get a job is in the public sector. So you go and work in the campaign for a local representative or congressman with the hope that they will give you or a relative a job once they\u2019re in charge.\u201d\n\nEconomic concerns\n\nDespite Panama\u2019s low inflation rate and sustained economic growth, the World Bank considers it to be the third most unequal country in Latin America, behind Brazil and Colombia.\n\nWhile the economy grew at a rate of 7.3 percent last year, that growth was uneven, with 12.9 percent of Panamanians continuing to live in poverty on an income of $6.85 a day or less.\n\nUnemployment likewise is improving, with the World Bank indicating the joblessness rate sits at 7.4 percent, down from more than 18 percent in 2020.\n\nBut the organisation noted that job quality \u201cstill shows signs of deterioration\u201d and that the labour market \u201cfailed to improve for all demographic groups\u201d.\n\n\u201cUnemployment is above 50 percent among young people,\u201d says Ileana Corea, an economist and former student leader. \u201cThis rate is well above the general unemployment rate.\u201d\n\nWhile general unemployment has been in decline since the pandemic, almost half of the workforce does not have a contract. Workers are instead forced to take informal jobs with few protections and little stability.\n\nThat also means fewer workers are contributing to public funds through payroll deductions. Yet, critics have pointed out that the eight presidential candidates have been hesitant to address the entrenched fiscal issues Panama faces.\n\n\u201cNone of the candidates have presented concrete proposals,\u201d Publio Cort\u00e9s, a former vice minister of finance, told Al Jazeera. \u201cOne of the accepted realities is that the state will have to chip in.\u201d\n\nCort\u00e9s also noted that the international agency Fitch recently downgraded Panama\u2019s credit rating over issues like \u201cparty fragmentation\u201d and \u201cinstitutional weakness\u201d.\n\nThe lowered credit rating is likely to increase the interest rates that the government must pay, putting a further strain on its finances.\n\n\u201cWith a government deep in debt that has recently lost its investment grade, it will also reduce the state\u2019s capacity to attend to other public necessities,\u201d Cort\u00e9s said.\n\nMining controversy\n\nFitch also cited the closure of a controversial mine in its decision to decrease Panama\u2019s credit rating.\n\nThe site, called Cobre Panam\u00e1, was one of the world\u2019s largest copper mines. Previously, it contributed 5 percent of Panama\u2019s gross domestic product.\n\nBut in November, the country\u2019s Supreme Court ruled the mine\u2019s 20-year contract was unconstitutional. Shortly thereafter, officials ordered it closed.\n\n\u201cThe mine is in hibernation, like it\u2019s waiting for the new president,\u201d said Raisa Banfield, an environmental activist and former vice mayor of the capital, Panama City.\n\nAll the presidential candidates have claimed they will uphold the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, though Banfield said some have shown potential conflicts of interest.\n\nVice President Carrizo, for instance, has admitted to serving as a lawyer for the mine\u2019s previous owner, Petaquilla Minerals.\n\nAnother candidate, former Foreign Minister R\u00f3mulo Roux, was part of the law firm that advised the mine\u2019s most recent owner, the Canadian group First Quantum, about acquiring the site.\n\n\u201cThe only candidates who have talked about the closure and transformation of the site are Ricardo Lombana and Maribel Gord\u00f3n,\u201d Banfield said.\n\n\u201cThey have explained what they want to do afterwards. But, besides that, the environmental discourse of the candidates is pretty weak.\u201d\n\nActivists like Banfield also warn the fight over the mine is far from over. First Quantum has already initiated proceedings to seek $20bn in reparations for the closure through international arbitration \u2014 a large sum that could dent the government\u2019s coffers.\n\nThe company has also articulated plans to meet with Panamanian officials after the elections, in the hopes of reopening the mine.\n\nEnvironmental questions\n\nHundreds of protesters have flooded the streets over the last year to show support for the closure of the Cobre Panam\u00e1 mine and other environmental concerns.\n\nClimate change has remained a prominent issue in Sunday\u2019s elections, especially for young voters who comprise nearly half of Panama\u2019s electorate.\n\nAlong the coast, rising sea levels have endangered Indigenous groups like the Guna, whose members have seen their island homes submerged by yearly floods.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o weather patterns, meanwhile, have heightened heatwaves and contributed to an extreme, months-long drought that began in 2023.\n\nWater scarcity has become a pressing issue in the country. According to the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (CEPAL), about 5 percent of Panama\u2019s population lacks access to basic water and sanitation services.\n\nThe drought is also causing commerce to suffer. The Panama Canal is a crucial international shipping route, allowing boats to cut across the country and travel between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.\n\nBut the canal requires a steady water level for ships to pass through its locks and chambers. With the drought wreaking havoc on those water levels, the canal has had to cut back on its traffic.\n\n\u201cThe drought in the canal is like when you have a restaurant and a queue outside that can\u2019t get in because you don\u2019t have enough tables,\u201d Argote, the economist, told Al Jazeera.\n\nCanal administrators have estimated that the bottleneck will cost them up to $700m in revenue losses.\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t receiving the money we could be receiving due to the water problems,\u201d Argote said.\n\nChange on the horizon?\n\nThe experts who spoke to Al Jazeera, including Nevache, warn that whoever wins Sunday\u2019s election will face an uphill battle in addressing Panama\u2019s myriad issues.\n\nOne of the challenges will be rallying members of the National Assembly. A record number of independent candidates, 127, are running to serve in the legislature during Sunday\u2019s election, without party allegiances to unify them once in office.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re ideologically very diverse, going from left to far right,\u201d Nevache said.\n\nSome of the presidential candidates are also seeking to overhaul the constitution if they take power, in an effort to extinguish the country\u2019s corruption.\n\nRoux, for example, has pledged to call a constituent assembly within 30 days of taking office to revise the current charter, which dates to 1972.\n\nAnother candidate, Lombana, likewise said a new constitution was necessary \u201cto change the rules that have protected the corrupt\u201d.\n\nHowever, Cort\u00e9s, the former finance minister, told Al Jazeera that he doubts a new constitution will solve Panama\u2019s array of problems.\n\n\u201cA new legal framework isn\u2019t a magic elixir for excessive inequality and lack of opportunities for the young,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he did acknowledge that constitutional reform has widespread popular support.\n\n\u201cLarge sectors of the population believe that the biggest problems in the country can be resolved with constitutional changes,\u201d he explained. \u201cThat\u2019s why politicians offer it, because the people ask for it.\u201d",

        "text": "Is 2024 Doomed to Repeat 1968 or 2020\u2014or Both?\nHere we go again. On Wednesday, Donald Trump, while spending a day off from his criminal trial in Manhattan on the road in the swing states of Wisconsin and Michigan, gave an interview to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. He was asked a question that, until Trump entered politics, never really needed to be asked in American public life: Win or lose, will you commit to accept the results of the 2024 election? \u201cIf everything\u2019s honest, I\u2019ll gladly accept the results,\u201d Trump told the newspaper. \u201cIf it\u2019s not, you have to fight for the right of the country.\u201d In other words: no.\n\nGiven that Trump has done this before in calling forth a violent movement to block the last election, you\u2019d think his warning of another \u201cfight\u201d would be major national news. You would be wrong. By Thursday morning, the Times had published a brief story about his refusal to unconditionally accept this year\u2019s election results, but there were no breaking-news alerts that I saw or big headlines on the front page. Politico\u2019s dispatch from the battleground tour with Trump, meanwhile, was headlined \u201cTrump, Free from Court, Finds \u2018a Little Fun on the Campaign Trail.\u2019 \u201d (The Washington Post and Politico each eventually posted stories on the interview on Thursday.) I get that it can be hard to figure out which threats to focus on from Trump, whose brand of entertainment-cum-demagoguery demands that he produce ever-more-alarming rhetoric in order to stay relevant nearly nine years into the show. But, seriously, did 2020 teach us nothing?\n\nTrump\u2019s announcement that he has no intention of peacefully accepting another defeat this fall, by the way, was only one of many extreme statements he made on his campaign swing. A day after being found in contempt of court for defying a gag order that prohibited the former President from posting social-media attacks on witnesses and the judge in his New York case, Trump disparaged the charges against him as \u201cbullshit\u201d and mocked the \u201ckangaroo court\u201d where he is being tried on allegations that he sought to tilt the 2016 election by paying the former adult-film star Stormy Daniels a hundred and thirty thousand dollars to buy her silence before the voting. Amid familiar complaints about electric cars and his favorite false claim that, when he was President, the U.S. had the greatest economy in the history of the world, there was a palpable threat of violence in his rhetoric. At one point, Trump announced, theatrically, \u201cIf we don\u2019t win this election, I don\u2019t think our country is going to survive. I\u2019ve never said that publicly, I don\u2019t think, but I\u2019ve felt it for a long time. I actually think our country\u2019s not going to survive.\u201d\n\nThis statement\u2014the menace of which was hard to miss, even if the threat itself was somewhat opaque\u2014came in the midst of an extended rant about Joe Biden\u2019s alleged plan to bring \u201cmassive numbers of Gazans from the Middle East . . . to your towns and villages.\u201d As the riled-up crowd in Waukesha, Wisconsin, booed and hissed, Trump turned the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas into one of his signature anti-immigration talking points, warning that Biden, in considering allowing into the U.S. an undisclosed number of Gazan refugees with relatives already living in the country, was \u201cdetermined to create the conditions for an October 7-style attack right here in America.\u201d It was scary stuff, an inflammatory new addition to the ex-President\u2019s racist road show. The crowd loved it. \u201cWe do not need a jihad in the United States of America,\u201d Trump said, to cheers and shouts of \u201cNo!\u201d \u201cWe do not need our once-great cities to become hotbeds of terrorism.\u201d\n\nThis week, the news seemed not so much focussed on the spectre of 2020 as that of a more distant election year: 1968. That was the immediate thought, at least, that sprang to mind while I watched the coverage of a large phalanx of armored N.Y.P.D. cops clear antiwar protesters from Hamilton Hall, the central administration building of Columbia University, which had been occupied overnight. History was overtly rhyming: the police action took place on the fifty-sixth anniversary to the day of the massive arrests that ended a student takeover of Hamilton Hall in the Vietnam era\u2014one of the iconic scenes of that iconic year.\n\nFor decades now, 1968 has been seen as the ultimate annus horribilis in American politics: the assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr., and Robert F. Kennedy; the race riots; the young antiwar leftists whose self-styled revolution triggered police violence at the Democratic Convention in Chicago and an allergic reaction in Middle America. After President Lyndon Johnson stepped aside, his Vice-President, Hubert Humphrey, inherited the chaos of a country and a Democratic Party torn asunder by Vietnam. The beneficiary of all this was Richard Nixon, who, promising a return of \u201claw and order,\u201d emerged the winner in November.\n\nThis is history as a cautionary tale. The Biden-Humphrey, Gaza-Vietnam, Trump-Nixon parallels may be inexact, but remind me, again, just why the Democrats decided to pick Chicago for this year\u2019s convention? Already, activist groups are promising major protests over Biden\u2019s support for Israel during the August gathering, all but guaranteeing bad split-screen visuals emphasizing young progressives\u2019 disillusion with a President who urgently needs a strong youth turnout to beat Trump. \u201cIt looks like a repeat in the making,\u201d the Democratic consultant Don Rose, who, in 1968, served as a spokesman for one of the main antiwar groups, told Chicago\u2019s CBS News affiliate this week. \u201cAt this moment, there\u2019s a perfect parallel.\u201d With confrontations between campus protesters and police spreading nationwide in the wake of Columbia\u2019s crackdown, Meghan McCain, somewhat more crudely, summed up the emerging conventional wisdom about 2024 in a tweet on Thursday: \u201cThe DNC convention this summer is going to be a fucking shit show.\u201d\n\nTrump, for his part, has long been obsessed with Nixon\u2019s 1968 \u201claw and order\u201d strategy; both his 2016 and 2020 races deployed the same playbook, years before the war in Gaza was dividing Democrats. Of course, he will do so again, especially now that the political conditions appear to resemble that year even more than before. This, it seems to me, is both Biden\u2019s peril and opportunity. For Trump, it\u2019s less than ideal to be running as a \u201claw and order\u201d candidate while simultaneously facing nearly ninety felony charges in four separate criminal proceedings. And yet it speaks to the bizarreness of the present moment that Trump has bashed the pro-Palestinian student protesters while also suggesting that they may receive more lenient treatment than the January 6th rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on his behalf. There is also the matter of picking one\u2019s enemy. How odd was it, a couple of weeks back, to see Trump, he of the \u201cMuslim ban\u201d and the unqualified support for Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing Israeli government, chuckling as his rally-goers picked up the far left\u2019s \u201cGenocide Joe\u201d chant? \u201cThey\u2019re not wrong,\u201d Trump said.\n\nFor now, Biden appears to have taken the advice that James Traub, the author of a timely new biography of Humphrey, offered in the Wall Street Journal this week. \u201cThe lesson of 1968,\u201d Traub wrote, \u201cis that while the fireworks are on the left, the votes are on the right.\u201d Which is as good an explanation as any for why Biden, when he spoke to reporters on Thursday, in his most extensive comments to date on the escalating protests, sternly lectured that there was \u201cnot a right to cause chaos\u201d along with the right to protest, rejected any suggestion that he change course in his Middle East policies, and dismissed Republican calls to bring in the National Guard to calm the campuses. The message was clear: this \u201cmoderate liberal in an age of extremism,\u201d as Traub called him, is staying the course.\n\nThe truth is that it\u2019s far too early to know whether the historical dread that many Democrats feel about a 1968 redux is warranted. Maybe, by the fall, the war in Gaza will no longer be front and center. Perhaps, by then, the students will be more focussed on Trump\u2019s threats to their reproductive freedom, their democracy, or consumed by some other Trumpian outrage that has yet to occur. What\u2019s already both knowable and known, however, is that if Trump is once more defeated, he\u2019s planning on pulling a 2020 all over again. On this, at least, take him at his word. \u2666",

        "text": "Why Trump edges Biden on gas prices\nSome Americans have rosy memories of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, perhaps because gasoline was cheaper then. Trump gets better marks than Biden on economic issues, one of the big reasons he\u2019s beating Biden in some 2024 presidential election polls.\n\nBut gas prices were cheaper during Trump\u2019s presidency for reasons that had nothing to do with Trump and are no longer in force. Anybody who thinks Trump would take some kind of decisive action to lower energy prices if he wins a second presidential term is likely to end up deeply disappointed.\n\nFirst, the facts. Oil and gasoline prices were subdued from 2014 through early 2021, which included the Trump presidency. When Trump took office in January 2017, the average price of gas was $2.47 per gallon. The average for his entire four-year term was only slightly higher, at $2.57. Excluding the COVID pandemic that dominated Trump\u2019s last 10 months in office and sent oil and gas prices plummeting, the average pump price was $2.67.\n\nWhen Biden took office in January 2021, gas prices averaged $2.42. But they shot up along with oil prices, peaking at $5 per gallon in June 2022. Through Biden\u2019s presidency so far, gas prices have averaged $3.61. That\u2019s 40% higher than gas prices during Trump\u2019s entire term and 35% higher if you exclude the COVID period.\n\nEven adjusting for inflation, gas prices have been considerably higher under Biden. The average Trump price, in 2024 dollars, was $3.18. The average Biden price was $3.86. That\u2019s 21% higher under Biden, adjusted for inflation.\n\nIt might seem easy to conclude that Biden is responsible for the higher gas prices of the last two years, since Biden is a green energy champion who has bad-mouthed the fossil fuel industry. Trump, by contrast, cheers oil and gas and says his energy policy is \u201cdrill, baby, drill.\u201d\n\nBut market forces that no US president can control explain the recent history of oil and gas prices far more than anything Trump or Biden has done. Those market forces also negate the idea that Trump or any president could enact policies that would somehow lower gasoline and other energy costs for American consumers.\n\nTrump came into office as the American hydraulic fracturing revolution was picking up steam. Fracking, as the technology is known, led to a massive boom in US oil production, which got started under the Obama administration around 2012. The following chart shows how US production hit a new high during Obama\u2019s presidency in 2015, hit another series of highs under Trump, and then dropped sharply after COVID hit in 2020.\n\nThen \u2014 surprise \u2014 US oil production surged to yet another record high under Biden. How could that be? Biden canceled the Keystone XL pipeline project and took other steps to limit domestic oil and gas development. He also signed into law a huge set of green energy incentives meant to speed the displacement of fossil fuels.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite all that, the US president doesn\u2019t control oil or natural gas production the way the leaders of big autocratic oil-producing nations such as Saudi Arabia and Russia do. There\u2019s no US government quota for fossil fuel production. Instead, private-sector firms driven by free-market principles drill more or less based on how they think they can optimize their financial returns. During the early days of fracking, many drillers \u2014 and their investors \u2014 prioritized growth and market share over profitability, similar to many startup industries. At the same time, Saudi Arabia and other OPEC+ nations amped up their own production to defend their global market share against the American upstarts. That flood of oil kept prices depressed. Many US energy firms lost money. \u201cUS energy investors subsidized consumers around the world,\u201d Raoul LeBlanc, vice president of the energy practice at S&P Global, told Yahoo Finance in 2022. \u201cUS consumers got used to low prices they think of as normal. But for these firms to be profitable, prices have to be higher.\u201d Some fossil fuel critics think of Big Oil as a bottomless source of cash, but low prices for consumers came at the expense of profits for producers. From 2010 through 2020, the profit margin for energy firms in the S&P 500 stock index averaged just 2.6%. That was the worst of all 11 sectors during that time and way lower than the 9% average for the S&P overall. The COVID year of 2020 was a bloodbath for the energy industry, with so much overproduction that oil prices briefly fell below zero because there was no more room for storage. More than 600 energy firms went bankrupt. That searing experience changed the entire industry. Market share was out. Profits were in. Energy firms slashed capacity\u2014including refineries that turn oil into gasoline\u2014and drillers began practicing \u201ccapital discipline,\u201d investing in new production only if there was a high likelihood of near-term profits. Drop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter. A customer fills up his vehicle's gas tank at a gas station in Buffalo Grove, Ill., Tuesday, April 23, 2024. (Nam Y. Huh/AP Photo) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS One irony is that fossil fuel firms have done better under Biden than they did under Trump. During Trump\u2019s four years in office, the average profit margin of the energy sector was an awful -0.6%, according to S&P Capital IQ. That includes 2020, when the energy profit margin was -16%, the worst performance of any sector, by far, in any year since at least 2010. During Biden\u2019s three years, the energy sector profit margin has averaged a healthy 11%, with Capital IQ forecasting the same margin for 2024. That\u2019s roughly the same as the average profit margin for the S&P overall. Tech is the most profitable sector, with a 22% margin in 2023, double the energy sector. Anybody looking for Biden\u2019s fingerprints on energy sector profits (or losses) won\u2019t find them. Biden\u2019s actions on energy have almost totally targeted future development, not current production. The Keystone XL pipeline Biden killed, for instance, wasn\u2019t even built yet, and it would have carried Canadian oil to Gulf Coast refineries where at least some of it would likely have been exported. Killing XL had no effect whatsoever on current oil or gasoline prices. Market factors explain virtually everything about oil and gas prices under Biden, as they did under Trump. Saudi Arabia and other OPEC+ nations have cut production during the last two years to keep prices high. Unlike the US president, the leaders of those countries do exercise control over national oil production. Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine created other snags in global energy flows, putting upward pressure on prices even now, more than two years later. American producers are now pumping record amounts of oil because they\u2019re making money doing so. If oil prices fell because OPEC+ started producing more, or for any other reason, it would be less profitable for US drillers and they\u2019d probably cut back. If Trump became president, he could try to ease permitting and take other steps to encourage even more US oil production. But drillers are no longer going to risk losing money by producing too much, no matter what any president does. They tried that in the 2010s and got badly burned. American drivers prefer the lower prices of the Trump presidency to the higher prices under Biden, but American drillers sure don\u2019t. Rick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "summary": " Gallup poll: 41% of Americans name inflation as most important financial problem facing family . Cost of owning or renting a home ranks second this year at 14%, a new high for that issue . Inflation is named most often by all key societal subgroups but garners higher mentions from certain age, income and political groups .",
        "text": "Americans Continue to Name Inflation as Top Financial Problem\nWASHINGTON, D.C. -- For the third year in a row, the percentage of Americans naming inflation or the high cost of living as the most important financial problem facing their family has reached a new high. The 41% naming the issue this year is up slightly from 35% a year ago and 32% in 2022. Before 2022, the highest percentage mentioning inflation was 18% in 2008. Inflation has been named by less than 10% in most other readings since the question was first asked in 2005.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nThe latest results are from Gallup\u2019s annual Economy and Personal Finance poll, conducted April 1-22.\n\nGallup has asked Americans at least annually since 2005 to name, without prompting, the top financial problem facing their family. Inflation has topped the list for the past three years. The cost of owning or renting a home ranks second this year at 14%, a new high for that issue.\n\nOther significant problems Americans identify include having too much debt (8%), healthcare costs (7%), lack of money or low wages (7%), and energy costs or gas prices (6%).\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nOver the past 19 years, healthcare costs and lack of money or low wages have frequently ranked near the top of the list, while the cost of energy or gas has done so at times of elevated gas prices, as in 2005, 2006 and 2008.\n\nInflation Named Most Often by All Subgroups\n\nInflation is named the most important financial problem by all key societal subgroups but garners higher mentions from certain age, income and political groups.\n\n46% of older Americans (those aged 50 and older) mention inflation, in contrast with 36% of younger Americans (those under 50).\n\nInflation is a more top-of-mind concern for middle-income (46%) and upper-income Americans (41% of those with an annual household income of $100,000 or more) than for lower-income Americans (31% of those with a household income of less than $40,000).\n\n56% of Republicans, compared with 39% of independents and 26% of Democrats, name the issue as the most important financial problem facing their family.\n\nYounger and lower-income Americans may be less likely to name inflation than their counterparts because other immediate financial concerns are more pressing for them. For example, 21% of adults under age 50 say housing or rental costs are their top concern, compared with 8% of those aged 50 and older.\n\nLower-income Americans are more inclined than upper-income and middle-income Americans to say personal debt, healthcare costs, lack of money and job loss are the top concerns facing their family.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nRetirement, Medical Emergencies Also Worrisome\n\nA separate question in the survey asks Americans to say how much they worry about each of eight specific personal financial matters. Inflation is not one of those issues, but its influence is apparent in the heightened percentage who worry about not being able to maintain their standard of living. Fifty-five percent are very or moderately worried about maintaining their living standards, the third straight year a majority has done so after being below that level from 2017 through 2021.\n\nSince the question was first asked in 2001, an average of 47% of U.S. adults, including a high of 58% in 2011, have worried about being able to maintain their standard of living.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nMaintaining one\u2019s standard of living ranks as one of the three economic matters Americans worry most about, along with not having enough for retirement and being unable to pay medical bills in the event of a serious illness or accident. The latter two issues have consistently ranked first or second each year in Gallup polling dating back to 2001.\n\nLess than half of U.S. adults worry about the five other financial matters, including normal medical costs, normal monthly bills, housing costs, paying for their children\u2019s college and making minimum payments on credit cards.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nCompared with last year, there have been slight declines in the percentages worried about medical costs for a serious illness or accident (from 60% to 56%) and not having enough money for retirement (from 66% to 59%). Both issues are now closer to their historical averages after being slightly above them last year. For the other six financial matters, the percentages worried about them are essentially unchanged from a year ago.\n\nAs would be expected, those with a lower household income worry more than those with greater resources about nearly all of these financial matters. The one exception is affording college for a child, which shows no meaningful differences by income. Across the eight financial matters, an average of 60% of lower-income Americans express worry, compared with 47% of middle-income and 31% of upper-income Americans.\n\nMajorities of lower-income adults worry about six of the eight financial matters, compared with three issues for middle-income adults and only one for those in upper-income households.\n\nThe greatest disparity in worry on any single issue between income groups is being able to pay one\u2019s normal monthly bills, which concerns 67% of lower-income adults but only 21% of upper-income adults.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nRatings of Personal Finances Remain Subdued\n\nForty-six percent of Americans rate their personal finances as excellent or good, similar to what Gallup has measured the past two years but a worse evaluation than in 2017 through 2021. Meanwhile, 36% describe their finances as \u201conly fair,\u201d while 17% rate them as \u201cpoor.\u201d\n\nAmericans\u2019 ratings of their personal financial situation were worse than now between 2009 and 2012, as the U.S. was coming out of the Great Recession and unemployment was high. During those years, an average of 42% of Americans rated their personal finances positively.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nAll income groups remain less positive about their financial situation now compared with 2021. Currently, 72% of upper-income, 42% of middle-income and 25% of lower-income Americans rate their situation as excellent or good.\n\nAnother question in the survey finds 62% of Americans saying they have enough money to live comfortably, similar to the 64% recorded last year but down from 2022 (67%) and 2021 (72%). Gallup has only had one lower reading on this question since 2002 -- 60% in 2012. The high point was 75% in 2002, the first year the question was asked.\n\nEighty-three percent of upper-income, 62% of middle-income and 37% of lower-income adults say they have enough to live comfortably, with similar declines in each group since 2021.\n\nAmericans Slightly More Optimistic Their Financial Situation Is Improving\n\nThere has been a slight increase in the percentage of Americans who say their financial situation is getting better -- 43% say this, up from 37% in both 2022 and 2023. The current figure is still significantly below the 52% measured in 2021.\n\nAt the same time, 47% say their financial situation is getting worse, up by 17 percentage points since 2021.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nA slim majority of upper-income Americans, 52%, believe their financial situation is improving, as do 43% of middle-income and 34% of lower-income Americans.\n\nBottom Line\n\nInflation continues to be an issue for Americans and is likely why less than half are positive about their financial situation. In addition to being named the most important financial problem facing their family, inflation also ranks as one of the domestic problems Americans worry most about. The issue trails only immigration, the government and the economy in general when Americans are asked to name the most important problem facing the country.\n\nThe U.S. inflation rate has declined significantly since its peak in 2022, but that has done little to alter Americans\u2019 perceptions of their finances. This could reflect the cumulative effect of higher prices for the past few years and the fact that inflation has remained above the lower rates in the U.S. between 2012 and 2020. The latest government reports suggest inflation may be increasing again. That news persuaded the Federal Reserve to delay interest rate cuts it was expected to make this year.\n\nThe issue also stands to be a key election issue, and renewed inflation would hamper President Joe Biden\u2019s chances of reelection.\n\nTo stay up to date with the latest Gallup News insights and updates, follow us on X.\n\nLearn more about how the Gallup Poll Social Series works.\n\nView complete question responses and trends (PDF download).\n\n###Embeddable###",

        "text": "Google expands passkey support to its Advanced Protection Program ahead of the US presidential election\nAhead of the U.S. presidential election, Google is bringing passkey support to its Advanced Protection Program (APP), which is used by people who are at high risk of targeted attacks, such as campaign workers, candidates, journalists, human rights workers, and more.\n\nAPP traditionally required the use of hardware security keys, but soon users can enroll in APP with passkeys. Users will have the option to use passkeys alone or alongside a password or hardware security key.\n\n\u201cIn a critical election year, we\u2019ll be bringing this feature to our users who need it most, and continue to work with experts like Defending Digital Campaigns, the International Foundation for Electoral Systems, Asia Centre, Internews, and Possible to help protect global high-risk users,\u201d Google\u2019s VP of Security Engineering, Heather Adkins, said in a blog post.\n\nGoogle says passkeys have been used to authenticate users more than 1 billion times across over 400 million Google Accounts since the company launched passkey support in 2022. Google says passkeys are used on Google Accounts more often than legacy forms of two-step verification, such as SMS one-time passwords and app-based one-time passwords combined.\n\nPasskey logins make it harder for bad actors to remotely access your accounts since they would also need physical access to a phone. Passkeys also remove the need to rely on username and password combinations, which can be susceptible to phishing.\n\nThe technology has been adopted by numerous other companies, including Apple, Amazon, X (formerly Twitter), PayPal, WhatsApp, GitHub and TikTok.\n\nGoogle also announced that it\u2019s expanding its Cross-Account Protection program, which shares security notifications about suspicious activity with the third-party apps you\u2019ve connected to your Google account. The company says this helps prevent cybercriminals from gaining access to one of your accounts and using it to infiltrate others. Google notes that it\u2019s protecting 2.4 billion accounts across 3.4 million apps and sites and that it\u2019s growing its collaborations across the industry.",

Jewish Americans are further alarmed by chants on college campuses of \"from the river to sea\" and \"go back to Poland\" Anti-Defamation League: Antisemitism \"comes from all sides\"",
        "text": "Jewish voters could sway US presidential election\n\"Is it good for the Jews?\" That has been a question long asked by Jewish Americans, especially immigrants and those of the second generation, scarred by memories of the Holocaust, when assessing the policies of the U.S. government and the pledges of political candidates.\n\nMost of them, most of the time since Franklin Roosevelt first ran for president in 1932, have voted for the Democrat at the top of the ticket.\n\nFast forward 92 years. More Jews have been voting Republican in recent elections, while many younger and left-leaning Jewish voters no longer see unequivocal support for Israel as a litmus test.\n\nInstead, rising antisemitism is reforging a sense of Jewish self-identity \u2014 especially among those who consider themselves fully assimilated and accepted in the American mainstream culture.\n\nAntisemitism \u201ccomes from all sides,\" said Rachel Sass, antisemitic incident specialist at the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism. \"There are right-wing extremists, left-wing extremists, anti-Israel protesters. There isn't necessarily a clear political or ideological bent, just antisemitism.\u201d\n\nThere has been a 900% increase in the number of antisemitic incidents in the past decade, with a spike since the Israel-Hamas conflict blew up last year, according to the ADL.\n\nJewish Americans are further alarmed by chants on college campuses \u2014 in reaction to Israel's retaliatory strikes on Gaza following the October 7 Hamas terror attack \u2014 of \"from the river to sea\" and \"go back to Poland,\u201d along with some physical assaults on Jewish students.\n\n\"I've seen people respond with a level of fear, being afraid to reveal their Jewish identity. I've seen other people who have even leaned more into pride in their Jewish identity, wanting to be even more open because they feel that it's very important,\" said Sass.\n\nBestselling novelist Allison Winn Scotch said on the social media platform Threads, \"Every day, as a Jewish American, I get increasingly nervous that we can't come back from the brink of this. I don't know where my family could go though, and I don't know how we would stay safe when we got there anyway.\"\n\nShe continued, \"Your Jewish friends are living with a blooming seed of dread in the pits of our stomachs.\"\n\nAmerica provided a refuge for Eastern European Jews escaping 19th-century pogroms, who followed the emigration from the more established and prosperous German Jewish community.\n\nMany Jews in the United States, however, did not feel totally accepted into broader American culture until the civil rights movement. Changes not only benefited Blacks but also removed remaining barriers to Jews \u2014 such as housing covenants and restricted country club memberships, as well as hiring discrimination at prestigious law firms and entry quotas at the Ivy League universities that such attorneys were drawn from.\n\nThe contemporary surge in antisemitism is not institutional.\n\n\"It's children being targeted at school with antisemitic bullying, synagogues being targeted with threats of bombs or shootings, people even being assaulted on the street because they are visibly Jewish or Orthodox,\" according to Sass at the ADL.\n\nAmerican Jews, as is the case with other ethnic or minority groups, do not wholly cast votes based on a single issue.\n\n\"We swing with the rest of the country around economic issues, war and peace and all kinds of issues,\" Mark Mellman, president of the Democratic Majority for Israel, told VOA.\n\nThe Republican Jewish Coalition's political and communications director, Sam Markstein, said, \"I think this will be the first time for a lot of Jewish voters who've never even considered voting Republican in their lives seriously making that consideration this year because of the dereliction of leadership by the Biden administration on these issues.\"\n\nDonald Trump, hoping for a second term as president but defeated by Joe Biden four years ago, received somewhere between one-fourth and one-third of the Jewish vote in 2020, according to several polls and Jewish organizations.\n\n\"Anybody who knows anything about Donald Trump knows that his alliances are based on people's commitment to him personally, not to a set of values, not to a set of strategic interests,\" said Mellman.\n\nRepublicans have done a better job than Democrats in condemning politicians in their respective parties who make antisemitic remarks, Markstein contended, pointing out the RJC supports primary challengers to Republicans in Congress who make such discriminatory comments.\n\n\"Unfortunately, there are too many on the Democratic side that don't seem to want to follow that path and want to either run and hide or issue mealy-mouthed responses that piss everybody off,\" Markstein told VOA.\n\nAlthough Jews constitute only 2.4% of the U.S. adult population, they are more likely to vote than the general registered voting population and to make political donations.\n\n\"The Jewish vote in those [swing] states is going to be the decisive [factor],\" Markstein predicted.\n\nThe Republicans tend to draw most of their Jewish strength from the religious Orthodox, the fastest-growing but still smallest Jewish community among the three largest denominations. Most Orthodox Jews strongly support Israel.\n\n\"Day after day, the administration's response gets less and less supportive of Israel,\" Markstein contended.\n\nA majority of Conservative and Reform Jews tend to vote for Democrats and are more open-minded about a two-state solution in the Middle East that would create a sovereign Palestine.\n\n\"To retain Jewish support, Biden's campaign needs to keep doing exactly what they're doing \u2014 standing strong with Israel, against antisemitism and behind the American Jewish community,\" Mellman said. \"That's exactly what I think American Jews are looking for at this very difficult time. It's exactly what the president is doing.\"\n\nVOA White House Bureau Chief Patsy Widakuswara contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Q&A: Do Politics and Economics Go Hand in Hand?\nAlthough tickets to the event have sold out, registration is available for viewing it online.\n\nUVA Today checked in with Miller to get an idea of how the economy can affect elections.\n\nQ. Does the nation\u2019s economy really affect elections as much as we think?\n\nA. The state of the economy always has an impact on the election. There is a reason James Carville said, \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid.\u201d However, what a \u201cstrong\u201d or \u201cweak\u201d economy\u201d means is highly variable.\n\nAlmost any economist would acknowledge that the U.S. economy looks strong right now \u2013 low unemployment, significant wage growth, the erosion of years of inequality. However, macroeconomic forces look very different in different contexts. For example, inflation has been front and center on the American mind, and according to many surveys has driven negative perceptions of an otherwise strong economy in recent years.\n\nThe idea that you can have a good job, a good salary, and still not afford to buy a house can sour people on an otherwise booming economy, and in so doing influence the election cycle.\n\nQ. Presidents often try to influence the economy, from Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s tinkering with federal programs to Nixon\u2019s wage and price controls. How effective have presidents been, and do they really deserve as much blame and credit as they get or claim?\n\nA. I tend to follow the maxim of an English (soccer) manager who said, \u201cA good manager can make a team 10% better, but a bad manager can make it 50% worse.\u201d The same is true for presidents and the economy.\n\nI believe that a lot of blame/credit is viewed through too short a timeframe. I think that we should expand our temporal horizons and evaluate economic policy over the course of decades, as opposed to years or even quarters. Sound economic policy often takes a while to implement, and even longer to filter through the system and may produce a short-term slowing of the economy.\n\nHowever, elections play out in the very short term and the wise policy that will pay off in the long run can be seen as a negative by the electorate. Likewise, a president can push through a policy regime that can juice the economy in the short term, while producing major structural problems beyond the present election cycle.\n\nI think that voters should look at what a president wants to change about the system as a whole, rather than their evaluation of it at the present moment.\n\nQ. The current U.S. electorate appears highly polarized. What difficulties face the American economy and political system in this election?\n\nA. First, I should say that while we are certainly polarized at the moment, I am not sure that we are any more polarized than we have been on average over the course of American history.\n\nIn 1800, John Adams assured voters that the election of Thomas Jefferson would lead to the streets running knee-deep with blood, while Jefferson suggested that Adams would, quite literally, hand over the country to the king of England as soon as he was inaugurated.\n\nScott C. Miller, director of the Miller Center\u2019s Project on Democracy and Capitalism, which is sponsoring the program, is one of the panelists. (Contributed photo)\n\nLikewise, in the 1930s you had \u201cAmerica First\u201d rallies of American Nazis in Madison Square Garden while parades marched down Broadway with signs that said \u201cJoseph Stalin, My Leader.\u201d\n\nIt is bad right now, but I don\u2019t think it is that bad.\n\nThat said, just because we have survived these polarization crises in the past does not mean that we automatically will today.\n\nMost Americans, both throughout our history and today, believe the United States is a flawed, but still very real \u201cshining city on a hill.\u201d I deeply believe this myself.\n\nEconomically, I am actually quite bullish on the United States. It is true that inflation has not come down as much as we would like. However, considering we are only a few years out from a pandemic into which the Federal Reserve poured trillions of dollars to avoid a catastrophic deflation crisis, I believe we are doing as well as anybody could have hoped.\n\nThis does not mean many Americans are not struggling. The affordability crisis in housing is a major problem. Raising interest rates was essential to bring down inflation, but it also made the cost of housing skyrocket. When combined with major constraints on building in almost every market, many Americans feel like they are being pinched in ways they cannot escape.\n\nQ. Can the factors that create economic conditions be resolved by \u201cthe right person\u201d coming to power?\n\nA. History shows time and again that structural factors, as opposed to the elevation of a single leader, are much more important in addressing socioeconomic issues. Any single person with enough power to singularly address a problem also has the power to royally mess things up.\n\nThe dream of a benevolent and enlightened despot \u2013 who can solve climate change by decree, for example \u2013 relies on that person remaining benevolent and enlightened forever. Let\u2019s just say these types of figures are quite rare in human history. This is where independent institutions, buttressed by intrinsic norms, are invaluable.\n\nWhile messy and a bit slow, democratic capitalism has served not just the United States, but the countries in the world with the highest standards of living (and yes, this includes the very capitalist northern European countries like Denmark and Sweden), very well over the last century.",

        "text": "Reexamining the Insular Cases. Again. - Harvard Law School\nAs a college exchange student, I was living in France in 1988 when I became eligible to vote in my first U.S. presidential election. I dutifully sent away for my absentee ballot, carefully filled in my selection, and happily sealed up the manila envelope and dropped it in the mail, content that I had fulfilled a key part of my responsibility as an American citizen.\n\n\n\nIn the Insular Cases, the Court held that the U.S. could rule Puerto Rico and other territories largely without regard to the Constitution.\n\nHad I chosen to remain in France and declare residency there, I would have been able to continue to vote from abroad. But had I moved permanently to Puerto Rico, I would have been out of luck. Even as a U.S. citizen, and even though the Caribbean island is an official possession of the United States, I would have been unable to vote in federal elections, just like Puerto Rico\u2019s 3.2 million full-time residents today.\n\nThe problem stems from the Insular Cases, a series of decisions handed down by the United States Supreme Court beginning in 1901 that limited the scope of constitutional protections to the people of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines, territories annexed by the U.S. in 1898 following the Spanish-American War.\n\n\u201cUntil Congress decided they were incorporated, they would just remain in limbo, in this other state,\u201d said Fuentes-Rohwer. \u201cAnd once you did that, the argument was the Constitution applied differently, if at all.\n\nHarvard Law Visiting Professor Luis Fuentes-Rohwer wants law students to know about the Insular Cases, \u201cjust as they learn about Plessy v. Ferguson.\u201d Credit: James Brosher/Indiana University\n\nFuentes-Rohwer has added his name to the growing list of advocates who, in recent years, have called for the Court to reverse its precedents in the Insular Cases, and thereby expand the rights of the roughly 3.5 million residents of the five permanently inhabited, unincorporated territories still governed by the United States: Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In recent years, Ra\u00fal M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.) has introduced a congressional resolution with other members of Congress calling for the Insular Cases to be overturned. He did so most recently in April 2023, just eight months before the 125th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Paris, which ended the Spanish-American War. The Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in the cases, they wrote, \u201crest on racial views and stereotypes from the era of Plessy v. Ferguson,\u201d the 1896 Supreme Court ruling that allowed \u201cseparate but equal\u201d accommodations for white and Black people. These characterizations, they wrote, \u201chave long been rejected, are contrary to our Nation\u2019s most basic constitutional and democratic principles, and should be rejected as having no place in United States constitutional law.\u201d The resolution has been referred to the U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources\u2019 Subcommittee on Indian and Insular Affairs.\n\nCritics complain it\u2019s unfair that residents of certain U.S. territories continue to lack access to citizenship, voting rights in federal elections, certain federal benefits, and the ability to govern themselves, and even in some cases to maintain possession of their land. But the Court hasn\u2019t signaled whether it plans to significantly change the doctrine anytime soon, despite some pushback from certain justices in recent years.\n\nThe current legal landscape\n\nIn 2019, lawyers representing residents of Puerto Rico asked the Court to throw out the early 20th-century decisions, in a suit that challenged an oversight committee created by Congress to help manage the island\u2019s debt. The justices declined, noting that the case before them was squarely focused on questions central to the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution with no relevance to the Insular Cases.\n\nThree years later, Justice Neil Gorsuch \u201991 agreed with the 2022 majority ruling in United States v. Vaello Madero, which held that residents of Puerto Rico were not entitled to receive Supplemental Security Income benefits, noting that Congress has \u201cnot required residents of Puerto Rico to pay most federal income, gift, estate, and excise taxes. Congress likewise has not extended certain federal benefits programs to residents of Puerto Rico.\u201d But Gorsuch also issued a sharp rebuke, writing in his concurring opinion: \u201cA century ago in the Insular Cases, this Court held that the federal government could rule Puerto Rico and other Territories largely without regard to the Constitution. It is past time to acknowledge the gravity of this error and admit what we know to be true: The Insular Cases have no foundation in the Constitution and rest instead on racial stereotypes. They deserve no place in our law.\u201d In her dissenting opinion, Justice Sonia Sotomayor agreed with Gorsuch\u2019s view, noting that the Insular Cases were \u201cpremised on beliefs both odious and wrong.\u201d\n\nBut only six months later, the Court declined to take up Fitisemanu v. United States, in which plaintiffs asked the Court to both overturn the Insular Cases and rule on whether people born in United States territories are entitled to birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment\u2019s Citizenship Clause. To help understand what might come next in the debate, scholars say it\u2019s important to understand how the rulings initially came to be.\n\nA historical perspective\n\nFollowing the signing of the Treaty of Paris on Dec. 10, 1898, many policymakers thought the U.S. should model itself after the European powers that had colonized large swaths of the world, while others maintained it should do nothing of the kind. Both arguments, say historians, were saturated with racist attitudes about either who needed governing, or who should or could belong to an expanding American nation.\n\nAgainst that political backdrop, lawyers began developing legal theories that addressed how U.S. imperialism could be treated under the Constitution, said Gerald L. Neuman \u201980, J. Sinclair Armstrong Professor of International, Foreign, and Comparative Law at Harvard. Informing that legal discourse, he said, were views expressed in the Harvard Law Review, including those of then-Harvard government professor (and later president) Abbott Lawrence Lowell LL.B. 1880, who introduced the idea of a territory that would be subject to some provisions of the Constitution but not others.\n\nNeuman believes Lowell\u2019s reasoning is reflected in the Court\u2019s 5-4 decision in the 1901 case Downes v. Bidwell, in which the Court held that, although Puerto Rico belonged to the United States, it was not part of the U.S., and therefore not always subject to the same constitutional protections. The doctrine that the Downes ruling inspired, said Neuman, cemented the idea \u201cthat there are territories incorporated into the United States and territories that are unincorporated where the Constitution does not apply the same way.\u201d\n\nFor some territories, Professor Gerald Neuman sees a potential path between statehood and full independence.\u201cYou can repudiate the rationale of the Insular Cases. But maybe you don\u2019t overrule it in the sense of turning back the clock to the 19th century.\u201d Credit: Phil Farnsworth\n\nWhat the future holds\n\nScholars agree the path ahead is less than clear and that it may differ sharply depending on the individual territory. The Court could officially overturn the Insular Cases, rejecting their racial underpinnings, colonialist impulses, and the distinction they drew between incorporated and unincorporated territories, thus helping chart a path toward greater self-determination and participation in national government. But problems would remain.\n\n\u201cIncorporated territories don\u2019t have voting members of Congress, and Congress can enact whatever laws it wants in incorporated territories,\u201d said Neuman. \u201cSuch territories do get the full protection of the Bill of Rights, but a lot of the problems of nondemocratic governance would be the same if these cases were overruled.\u201d\n\nMany people think statehood could be a solution for Puerto Rico, where the current population outnumbers that of 18 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. The most recent nonbinding referendum on the island was held in November 2020, with 52% of those who voted opting for statehood. The Puerto Rico Status Act, introduced in Congress in 2023, aims to offer the island territory the option of voting for sovereignty in free association with the U.S., independence, or statehood.\n\nFor residents of other territories, a change in the status quo may be a less appealing possibility. In the 1970s, the Northern Mariana Islands chose not to seek independence from the United States, maintaining its relationship, many speculated, because of its proximity to China and the protections the U.S. could offer. And many in American Samoa have rejected the idea of U.S. citizenship, fearful it could disrupt their cultural traditions, and even affect rights to their land.\n\n\n\nEven if the Court overturned the cases, rejecting their racial underpinnings, the path forward for the five territories is far from clear.\n\nNeuman sees a potential path between statehood and full independence. \u201cYou can criticize the Insular Cases; you can repudiate the rationale of the Insular Cases. But maybe you don\u2019t overrule it in the sense of turning back the clock to the 19th century. Rather, you move forward into the 21st century, further developing what it means to have a separate kind of territorial relationship with the United States.\n\n\u201cThe idea that interests me in this regard is the question of whether there can be a binding agreement between the territory and the national government that Congress cannot break by legislation. There are some cases suggesting that that may be true of the compact between the Northern Mariana Islands and the United States. \u2026 That might be a way of finding an intermediate solution.\u201d\n\nChanging the curriculum\n\nOne important part of the path forward, according to some legal experts, is making more people aware of the cases, in particular budding lawyers. Many scholars have long been pressing for the cases to be considered a key part of law school curriculum.\n\nIn his 2000 paper \u201cWhy the Canon Should Be Expanded to Include the Insular Cases and the Saga of American Expansionism,\u201d Sanford Levinson, a visiting professor at Harvard Law, noted that his own education \u2014 including his graduate studies at Harvard, his legal training at Stanford, and even his early teaching involving constitutional law \u2014 didn\u2019t include the influential rulings. He suspected, he wrote, \u201cmy story is not in the least unusual.\u201d\n\nIn fact, at the start of a 2014 Harvard Law event dedicated to reevaluating the Insular Cases, then-Dean Martha Minow confessed she had never heard of them in law school, and that a goal of the conference was to help bring them into the light.\n\nFuentes-Rohwer\u2019s story was the same. \u201cI went to law school in the early \u201990s,\u201d he said, \u201cand we never heard of them.\u201d\n\nHe is hoping to change that. In 2021, Fuentes-Rohwer introduced a course on the cases at the Maurer School of Law at Indiana University, and last fall, he and Harvard\u2019s Guy-Uriel E. Charles, Charles J. Ogletree Jr. Professor of Law, taught a seminar at Harvard called American Empire: Puerto Rico and the United States Territories. The class examined a range of constitutional law questions and issues using the Insular Cases as their starting point.\n\nHarvard Law Professor Guy-Uriel Charles taught a seminar with Luis Fuentes-Rohwer last fall called American Empire: Puerto Rico and the United States Territories. Credit: Jessica Scranton\n\n\u201cWe feel very deeply that law school students should learn about the Insular Cases, the way they learn about Plessy as a way to Brown v. Board of Education,\u201d said Fuentes-Rohwer, who is also working on a documentary about the status of the U.S. territories. \u201cWe want to bring light to a problem that people don\u2019t know about, that law students don\u2019t know about, that my colleagues don\u2019t know about.\u201d\n\nFuentes-Rohwer, who also uses the cases to teach students about racism, judicial behavior, and precedent, hopes one day the Court will reject the rulings as it ultimately rejected Plessy and the 1944 landmark decision Korematsu v. United States, which upheld the forcible internment of Japanese Americans during World War II.\n\n\u201cThe language in the Insular Cases actually goes further in showing that the people in the territories are considered lesser humans, uncivilized \u2014 and not worthy of anything,\u201d he said, \u201cincluding, of course, citizenship.\u201d\n\nThe power of shame\n\nFuentes-Rohwer and Charles think lessons from the Civil Rights Movement can help shine a light on the road ahead. In their 2021 paper \u201cThe Shame of the Territories,\u201d they outline the role \u201cshame can play in constitutional interpretation and changing constitutional norms and jurisprudence.\u201d\n\nMany legal scholars believe the Insular Cases violate multiple constitutional protections, top among them two foundational amendments to the Constitution approved after the American Civil War to ensure the citizenship rights of people upon whom the nation had inflicted a \u201cprevious condition of servitude.\u201d These include full citizenship for anyone born in the U.S.; guarantees of life, liberty, and property except through due process of law; and equal protection for all.\n\n\u201cWe had a 14th Amendment, we had a 15th Amendment, we had a commitment to racial equality, but for so long that commitment failed to reach people on the ground. The right to vote meant nothing for 95 years until Birmingham, until Montgomery, until Selma, until the country was shamed to act,\u201d said Fuentes-Rohwer. \u201cIn our paper, we analogize to that moment and say presumably the only way we move forward on the territories is via shame, via a similar campaign and similar social movement, because the tragic nature of the territories is that most people don\u2019t even know they exist.\n\n\u201cUntil people are brought to understand that the U.S. Constitution is condoning colonialism, treating people as second-class citizens \u2026 until they\u2019re made aware of that,\u201d he said, \u201cnothing is going to change.\u201d",

That decision was challenged in the country\u2019s top court, which ruled on Friday that Mulino\u2019s candidacy did not violate the constitution.\n\nMagistrate Maria Eugenia Lopez, the president of the Supreme Court, told reporters that the jurists rejected the challenge by a margin of 8 to 1, and were persuaded to do so by the right of Panamanians \u201cto elect and be elected, and political pluralism\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat has moved this constitutional tribunal in the historic moment in which we find ourselves is the defence of our country and democracy as well as institutionality, social peace, the right to elect and to be elected, political pluralism and let\u2019s not forget the important role played by the political parties,\u201d she said, reading a statement on behalf of the court.\n\nWhile voters say he lacks Martinelli\u2019s charisma, Mulino, 64, has hewed close to his former running mate\u2019s policies. According to the most recent polls, he is leading the crowded field of eight candidates with more than 30 percent support.\n\nHe has also enjoyed vociferous support from Martinelli, who has remained inside Nicaragua\u2019s embassy in Panama after being granted political asylum by Managua.\n\nThe former president posted on his X account that the decision \u201cwill set an example for future electoral processes\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cTruth, law and justice always prevail in the end.\u201d\n\nMulino has promised to restore the economic prosperity of Martinelli\u2019s 2009-2014 presidency and crack down on migration through the Darien Gap jungle, which reached record numbers last year.\n\nBut corruption has also loomed large as a defining issue in public opinion polls with all eight contenders promising to address the issue. Seven of the candidates are considered to be conservative with only long-shot economist Maribel Gordon representing the left.\n\nPolls show former President Martin Torrijos trailing closest behind Mulino heading into Sunday\u2019s election, but he has only 5 percent of the vote.\n\nMulino has served as foreign minister and justice minister but gained the most notoriety as Martinelli\u2019s security minister.\n\nHe was widely condemned for a violent crackdown on Indigenous workers protesting conditions at banana plantations in 2010. The clashes left two people dead and more than 100 injured.",

        "text": "Mass deportations, detention camps, troops on the street: Trump spells out migrant plan\nDonald Trump is planning to unleash the biggest mass deportation of undocumented migrants in US history should he win re-election in November, involving legally questionable deployments of military and police units and the creation of vast detention camps along the southern border.\n\nTrump has laid out his vision for a \u201crecord-setting deportation operation\u201d in a series of rally speeches, newspaper articles and social media posts. He intends to move swiftly after inauguration day next January to stage mass roundups of immigrants across the country, conducting raids inside big cities where he would face certain Democratic opposition.\n\n\u201cOn day one, we will begin the largest domestic deportation operation in American history,\u201d Trump said at a campaign rally in Freeland, Michigan, on Wednesday. He told his adoring supporters that immigrants were coming in by the millions from foreign prisons and \u201cinsane asylums\u201d leading to the \u201cplunder, rape, slaughter and destruction of the American suburbs, cities and towns\u201d.\n\nImmigration experts say that the deportation plans for a Trump White House 2.0 dwarf anything previously seen \u2013 both in scale and in the intensity of the former president\u2019s determination to run roughshod over legal guardrails. He attempted workplace raids during his 2016 presidential term, but they were largely stymied in the courts.\n\n\u201cThis time we need to take Trump at his word,\u201d said David Leopold, a former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. \u201cWhen he talks about mass deportation \u2013 in boxcars, or bus loads, or planes, or whatever \u2013 that\u2019s what he\u2019s going to do.\u201d\n\nStephen Miller, Trump\u2019s former senior White House policy adviser and hardline immigration guru who is likely to be central in a second term, told the rightwing activist Charlie Kirk in a podcast interview that the plans were going to be pushed through. \u201cI want everybody to understand this is going to happen. If President Trump is back in the Oval Office in January, this is going to commence immediately.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Time magazine this week, Trump emphasized that speed was critical to his strategy for removing many of the at least 11 million people without legal status living in the US today.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be moving them out as soon as we get to it,\u201d he said.\n\nTo skirt around due process laws protecting asylum seekers, Trump has said he will invoke the 1798 Alien Enemies Act which allows for summary deportation of any non-citizen from a foreign enemy country. He says he will apply the provision in the first instance against \u201cknown or suspected gang members, drug dealers, or cartel members\u201d.\n\nImmigration experts fear that such summary removals could ensnare US citizens in the dragnet.\n\n\u201cTrump will have his agents remove people, then ask questions later. If somebody looks like they\u2019re undocumented, meaning they have brown or black skin, or speak with an accent, they could be included irrespective of their citizenship,\u201d Leopold warned.\n\nMass deportation would form the centerpiece of a Trump second term. It aligns with other aspects of his vision for the 47th presidency, which promises to be more ruthless, radical and revenge-laden than any administration in modern times.\n\nThe former president will be counting on the rightward shift in the federal judiciary, which he effected when he was last in the White House. Over the four years of his presidential term, he placed more than 200 judges on the bench, and succeeded in transforming the US supreme court into a rightwing bastion.\n\nView image in fullscreen Families are housed in overcrowded conditions at a US border patrol station on 10 June 2019 in McAllen, Texas, during Trump\u2019s first term. Photograph: Getty Images\n\nWith Trump and his team setting their sights on deporting more than a million people each year, the operation would inevitably require major infrastructure including new detention camps. Miller said that \u201clarge-scale staging grounds\u201d would be constructed near the border, probably in Texas.\n\n\u201cYou create this efficiency by having these standing facilities where planes are moving off the runway constantly, probably military aircraft,\u201d Miller told Kirk.\n\nFlesh has been placed on the bones of Trump\u2019s immigration plans by Project 2025, a presidential transition operation spearheaded by the rightwing Heritage Foundation that has compiled a 920-page policy review aiming to \u201cinstitutionalize Trumpism\u201d. By its calculations, the daily number of beds in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention centers would need to rise from the current 34,000 to more than 100,000.\n\nIce itself should be given free rein to carry out \u201ccivil arrest, detention, and removal of immigration violators anywhere in the United States, without warrant where appropriate\u201d, Project 2025 says (emphasis in the original). The Trump campaign has stressed that outside groups like Heritage do not speak for the former president, but the policies contained in the review hew closely to his intentions and are likely to provide foundations for administration policy.\n\nEven with its 21,000 employees, Ice would be overwhelmed by the task of rounding up millions of people without the involvement of other entities. Trump told Time magazine that he would turn initially to the national guard, and then to the US military.\n\n\u201cIf I thought things were getting out of control, I would have no problem using the military,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen Time pointed out that under the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act, the military is prohibited in most circumstances from acting domestically against civilians, Trump replied: \u201cWell, these aren\u2019t civilians. These are people that aren\u2019t legally in our country.\u201d\n\nIn fact, undocumented immigrants are civilians (though not citizens). As such, they enjoy equal protection rights under the US constitution.\n\nTrump likens his immigration plans to the mass deportation of some 300,000 Mexicans by President Dwight Eisenhower in 1955. Though Trump is contemplating massively greater numbers, the two plans bear striking similarities.\n\nBoth schemes were justified using racist stereotypes of immigrants. Eisenhower\u2019s was called \u201cOperation Wetback\u201d and portrayed Mexicans as dirty and dangerous.\n\nTrump repeatedly talks about \u201cmigrant crime\u201d at his rallies, telling Wednesday\u2019s crowd in Michigan that prisons and mental institutions all around the world were being \u201cemptied into the United States like we are a dumping ground\u201d. Notably, criminologists report that immigrants \u2013 whether they have legal status or not \u2013 are more law-abiding than US-born citizens.\n\nMass roundups are likely to threaten the \u201cDreamers\u201d, the more than half a million immigrants who came to the US as undocumented children and who have been granted partial rights to remain under the deferred action program known as Daca. Trump has indicated he intends to tear up the Daca scheme, which he tried and failed to do in his first term.\n\nView image in fullscreen Texas national guard troops try to untangle a person caught in razor wire after he crossed the US-Mexico border into El Paso on 31 January 2024. Photograph: John Moore/Getty Images\n\nTrump also plans to use state and local police forces to assist Ice in roundups. That would be embraced with alacrity by Republican-controlled states like Texas where the governor, Greg Abbott, is already striving to give state police the power to arrest undocumented migrants.\n\nBut it would be fiercely opposed in Democratic states which have tended to place a firewall between their law enforcement officers and federal immigration activities. Undocumented people are concentrated in big cities under Democratic control, such as New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, raising the specter under Trump\u2019s plans of open confrontation between law enforcement agencies receiving conflicting orders from authorities led by the two main parties.\n\nMiller said that Republican governors would be encouraged to deploy their national guard over the border into Democratic-controlled states where undocumented migrants enjoy so-called \u201csanctuary city\u201d protections. Virginia\u2019s Republican governor, Glenn Youngkin, could send troops into Maryland which has a Democratic governor, Wes Moore.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to go into an unfriendly state like Maryland, well, there would just be Virginia doing the arrest in Maryland, right, very close,\u201d he told Kirk\u2019s podcast.\n\nLeopold predicted that pitching one state against another would quickly deteriorate into a \u201cpolice state mentality\u201d.\n\n\u201cAre we going to see a complete breakdown of the unity of the American state?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201d",

Jackson Women's Health Organization decision, which allowed abortion restrictions to take effect around the country.\n\n\"So the salience of abortion as an issue is really different for Democratic voters this election cycle,\" PRRI CEO Melissa Deckman said. \"And of course, it's a direct reflection of the political landscape and the policy landscape in the wake of Dobbs.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIt also found a \"growing gap\" between Republicans and Democrats in their views on abortion, Deckman said.\n\nMost of that partisan gap stems from rising support for abortion rights among Democrats over the past decade or more, while Republican views have remained largely stable, she said. In the new report, 86% of Democratic voters surveyed in 2023 expressed support for abortion rights, up from 71% of Democrats in 2010. The poll also found growing support among independent voters.\n\nThose findings align with the results of exit polls from elections since the Dobbs decision in 2022. Since then, voters in several states have repeatedly signaled support for abortion rights, and a growing number have listed abortion as a top voting issue.\n\nLike other surveys in the past, PRRI's poll found that abortion was a particularly motivating issue for women and younger voters ages 18 to 29, and even more markedly for younger Democrats.\n\nNationwide, 64% percent of voters said abortion should be always or mostly legal; 35% said it should be always or mostly illegal. In most states \u2014 including states with Republican-controlled state governments \u2014 a majority of voters support legal abortion, and very few favor total bans.\n\n\"In no state does anywhere near a majority of state residents support the banning of abortions, yet we have a policy landscape in which some states have effectively made the procedure almost impossible to access,\" Deckman explained.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"So the policies that are being enacted in many red-state legislatures where Republicans control majorities, are clearly out of step with what the citizens in those states would like to see,\" she said.",

        "text": "Young people disapprove of Biden\u2019s Israel policy. It may not mean much for November.\nOn Tuesday night, hundreds of New York Police Department officers entered Columbia University and the City College of New York to remove protestors who had set up encampments and taken over administrative buildings in opposition to Israel's conduct in its conflict against Hamas, U.S. military support for Israel and colleges' investments in companies tied to Israel \u2014 just one in a series of clashes on college campuses across the country that have captured the attention of the media and the public.\n\nScenes of left-leaning collegiate protestors upset with President Joe Biden for his continued support for Israel \u2014 even as he's become more critical of its operations \u2014 and the lack of a ceasefire have raised the prospect that the Israel-Hamas conflict could significantly hurt Biden's support among younger voters in the 2024 presidential election. Some early general election polling suggests that Biden's edge among younger voters has either diminished substantially or even vanished altogether in his rematch against former President Donald Trump. Considering younger voters have routinely preferred Democrats by substantial margins in recent years, such trends could be a dire threat to Biden's reelection hopes.\n\nAlthough it's easy to connect these numbers to anger over the conflict in the Middle East, the Israel-Hamas conflict probably isn't the principal driver of Biden's loss in support among young people. Polls have found that young people care about other issues a great deal more than what's happening in the Middle East, so the issue that's roiling college campuses isn't necessarily representative of larger concerns.\n\nIn fact, it's likely that Biden's drop in support has more to do with the public's broad dissatisfaction with his presidency and his handling of other issues rather than a concern that's specific to young voters (like their more negative attitudes about the war). Still, whatever the cause, a drop in support and/or turnout among young voters would very likely hurt Biden's reelection chances, even though they won't actually make up that large a share of the electorate in 2024.\n\nYoung Americans are most critical of Israel\n\nIt's certainly true that polls have shown that young people are more likely to hold negative views about Israel \u2014 and U.S. support for Israel \u2014 than older Americans are. Take a late February survey by the Pew Research Center that had a very large sample size, which theoretically gave it a more representative pool of 18- to 29-year-olds (normally a difficult group to survey). On a host of questions, this youngest cohort of adults was more likely than their older counterparts to believe that the way Israel was responding to Hamas's attack had been unacceptable, to oppose the U.S. providing military aid to Israel, to view Biden's policies as too favorable toward Israel, to feel that Hamas had valid reasons for fighting Israel and to have at least somewhat more sympathy for Palestinians than Israelis.\n\nThis is not to say that most young people exhibited fervent anti-Israel views or that they favored Hamas. Overall, 21 percent of those aged 18 to 29 sympathized equally with both Israelis and Palestinians, compared with 33 percent who felt more sympathy for Palestinians and 14 percent for Israelis. And while a slight plurality of young people (34 percent) felt Hamas had valid reasons for fighting in this conflict, a slight plurality (38 percent) also felt that Israel had valid reasons for fighting. Plus, all age groups overwhelmingly said that the way Hamas carried out its attack on Oct. 7 was unacceptable \u2014 it's just that those aged 18 to 29 were most likely (35 percent of them) to say that both sides had behaved in an unacceptable fashion.\n\nStill, other surveys back up the notion that younger Americans hold strong feelings about the situation in Israel. The Harvard Youth Poll, conducted in March by the school's Institute of Politics, found that 51 percent of those aged 18 to 29 supported a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, a policy long supported by some progressive Democrats in Congress but one that will be difficult to achieve. Harvard's survey also found that more young Americans viewed Israel's response to Hamas's attack as unjustified than justified (32 percent to 21 percent), though almost half said they weren't sure. Still, nearly equal majorities felt sympathy for the Israeli and Palestinian people caught in this conflict (52 percent versus 56 percent).\n\nThe findings were similar in more recent national surveys of all Americans or registered voters, albeit ones that had smaller sample sizes of young people \u2014 and therefore a higher margin of error. A March survey from Gallup found that 55 percent of Americans overall disapproved of Israel's military action in Gaza, with 63 percent of those aged 18 to 34 disapproving. An April 28-30 YouGov/The Economist survey found those aged 18 to 29 were more likely to say they sympathized more with Palestinians (32 percent) than with Israelis (13 percent; 26 percent said they sympathized with both about equally) \u2014 making them the only age group to clearly sympathize more with Palestinians. The same poll also found that 39 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds felt Israel's military response had been too harsh, higher than any other age group.\n\nBut Israel-Gaza isn't a top priority for younger Americans\n\nFor all the focus on college campus protests, however, the conflict in Israel doesn't actually rate that highly as an important issue to most young Americans. To identify which issues young Americans viewed as most important, the Harvard Youth Poll randomly gave respondents different pairs of issues and asked them which was more important to them. Using that approach, the survey found that, much like Americans overall, young people are most worried about economic or economic-adjacent issues: Fifty-three percent or more rated inflation, jobs, housing and health care as more important than other issues. But only 34 percent rated \"Israel/Palestine\" as more important than other issues, which ranked it second to last \u2014 notably topping only student debt, another much-talked-about issue.\n\nInterestingly, the importance of Israel/Palestine among 18- to 29-year-olds didn't differ much between those who said they were currently college students \u2014 who are the ones mainly involved in protests \u2014 and those who weren't in college or had already graduated. Among college students, 35 percent said Israel/Palestine was more important than other issues, compared with 33 percent of those not in college and 36 percent of those who already had a college degree. Even among young Democrats, the party whose members are most opposed to Israel's actions and further military funding, just 37 percent said it was a more important issue.\n\nOther polling has also found younger Americans don't view this as an especially important issue for their vote in 2024. Bloomberg and Morning Consult have collaborated this cycle to survey registered voters in seven swing states, which has included asking respondents if an issue will be important to their choice in November. Their April poll of swing-state voters found just 59 percent of 18- to 34-year-olds in swing states rated the Israel-Hamas war as very or somewhat important to their vote.\n\nThat figure might sound high at first blush, but it was essentially tied for last place among the issues polled with the Russia-Ukraine war (58 percent). By contrast, a whopping 95 percent rated the economy as important, and around 90 percent said the same for each of crime, education, health care and housing. The story was similar among adult Generation Z voters, who are about 18 to 27 years old (so most of the 18-29 group). Sixty-three percent rated the Israel-Hamas war as important to their vote, but this ranked above only the Russia-Ukraine war as a top concern. And when asked what issue was most important to deciding their vote, just 3 percent of 18- to 34-year-olds and 4 percent of Gen Z voters named the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nIf other issues are more salient, then it's likely that Biden's deteriorating support among young people has more to do with broader dissatisfaction with his handling of the presidency than the Israel-Hamas conflict specifically. The president's overall job approval rating in 538's tracker is about 40 percent, while his disapproval rating is 56 percent. Poll after poll has found Americans, including young people, clearly disapprove of his performance as president.\n\nThose same surveys also find Biden well underwater on his handling of major issues like the economy, inflation and immigration, whether we're talking about attitudes among all Americans or just younger ones. This is not to say that Biden's handling of the Israel situation isn't a contributing factor \u2014 he polls quite poorly there, too, and voters can care about multiple issues \u2014 but it's likely playing at least second fiddle to other concerns.\n\nYoung voters will matter to the election outcome \u2014 but they alone can't save Biden\n\nWhen it comes to the impending Biden-Trump rematch, young voters' polling numbers have a Choose Your Own Adventure quality to them. Results in national surveys conducted by well-regarded pollsters have been all over the place, with some showing Biden ahead among young voters, the two candidates running about even or Trump holding a small edge. For most national surveys, one challenge is that the sample size of young voters is relatively small, meaning it will be less reliable.\n\nIt's perhaps not a coincidence, then, that recent national surveys with larger samples of young people \u2014 from the Harvard Youth Poll and the Pew Research Center \u2014 found Biden more clearly ahead among 18- to 29-year-olds: Among young registered voters, Harvard's early March poll found Biden up 50 percent to 37 percent (56 percent to 37 percent among likely voters), while Pew's early April survey found Biden ahead 59 percent to 38 percent.\n\nHowever, the Harvard poll also found that Biden's edge dropped if third-party candidates like Robert Kennedy Jr. were included. And both of these polls also suggested that newer entrants into the electorate \u2014 those who didn't vote in 2020, often because they weren't old enough yet \u2014 appear less averse to backing Trump. In the Harvard poll, Biden led by a smaller margin among those aged 18 to 24 than those aged 25 to 29. In Pew's survey, registered voters who didn't vote in 2020 (including those too young to vote in 2020) split about evenly for Trump and Biden.\n\nWhatever the actual truth is, polling broadly suggests that Biden is doing worse among young people than he did in 2020, which is undoubtedly a threat to his reelection chances. Younger voters have consistently voted more Democratic since the 2004 presidential election, and in 2020, they voted for Biden by around 25 percentage points, depending on the survey. Considering Biden's narrow margins of victory in key swing states, losing support among young people would be pretty bad news for him. As one scenario in 538's Swing-O-Matic interactive demonstrates, an increase in third-party voting and a drop in turnout among young people would potentially put Trump over the top by flipping Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin, holding 2020 levels of support among other groups equal.\n\nYet even if Biden were able to make a recovery with young voters, that doesn't mean he'd necessarily win the election. Currently, Trump leads Biden by less than 1 point in 538's national polling average. But Biden trails Trump in our averages for each of the important swing states by varying margins. All of this reflects a larger problem for Biden among voters beyond just young people.\n\nPlus, younger voters are the smallest part of the electorate by age. This is due in part to their tendency to turn out at a much lower rate than older voters. Based on calculations by political scientist Michael McDonald at the University of Florida Election Lab, about 53 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds eligible to vote turned out in 2020, the highest mark in modern times but a fair bit lower than that year's overall 66 percent turnout rate (a modern record). Moreover, voters aged 18 to 29 made up only about 16 percent of all 2020 voters, and the highest percentage they've made up in the past few decades was 18 percent in 1992.\n\n***\n\nWe're still about six months from the election, which means there is a lot of time for future events to shift Americans' attitudes about the 2024 election. But younger Americans' reduced willingness to support Biden stems from a dissatisfaction much broader than his response to the Israel-Hamas conflict. And while the students protesting on college campuses may be getting the lion's share of the attention, it's the millions of other young voters from whom Biden has more to worry about.",

The Republican National Convention will be held in Milwaukee July 15-18, when the vice presidential nominee is most likely to be declared. He is also likely to address the delegates on the penultimate night of the gathering. Trump declared the name of then-Indiana Governor Mike Pence as his running mate in the final week before the convention last time. It is expected that he will follow a similar timeline this time. But who will be named as the running president of the Republican candidate?Quoting an unnamed source, 'New York Post' has reported that biotech mogul Vivek Ramaswamy of Indian origin is leading the pack of potential candidates. His position was bolstered after South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem created controversy by recounting a 20-year-old story about killing her dog.Besides, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis told the donors in February that he would not be in the fray.According to 'Bloomberg', Donald Trump has narrowed his choices to four top contenders. They are North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum , Republican Sens. JD Vance of Ohio, Marco Rubio of Florida and Tim Scott of South Carolina.Replying to the 'Bloomberg' report, senior Trump adviser, Chris LaCivita, took to social media platform X. She wrote, \"Notice to reporters: you should not make these kind of assumptions and then commit them to paper \u2026 they will only come back to bite you in the ass.\"Another senior adviser Brian Hughes said in a statement, \"Anyone claiming to know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying, unless the person is named Donald J.

        "text": "RFK Jr. could be a spoiler in November. But will it help Biden or Trump?\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s presidential campaign was once viewed as a quixotic quest by a scion of a storied political family \u2014 an environmental warrior who sullied his family\u2019s name most recently by aligning himself with a political party founded by a segregationist to get on the November ballot in California.\n\nBut a combination of voter apathy about President Biden and former President Trump, the two main parties\u2019 presumptive nominees, and the Kennedy campaign\u2019s successful targeting of ballot qualification rules across the nation has prompted growing alarm among Democrats and Republicans alike.\n\n\u201cWhen you have nail-bitingly close elections, nearly any candidate can be a spoiler,\u201d said Thad Kousser, a political science professor at UC San Diego. \u201cNow, the interesting thing, unlike a Jill Stein [a perennial Green Party candidate], it\u2019s not 100% clear which major party candidate he hurts most. That uncertainty is going to lead to a lot of churning on what the parties do \u2026 to keep him off the ballot.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKennedy, the son of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy (D-N.Y.) and nephew of President John F. Kennedy, has no real chance of being elected to the White House in November. However, the Californian could be a spoiler in the race, tilting the vote. Two names are frequently raised: H. Ross Perot in the 1992 race and Ralph Nader in 2000, though there is debate about how much their candidacies resulted in Bill Clinton and George W. Bush winning their respective elections.\n\nKennedy has qualified to appear on the ballots of three states, most recently California, and his campaign claims to have collected enough signatures to appear on the ballots of seven others, including Nevada.\n\nIn California, the American Independent Party submitted paperwork to have Kennedy appear on the ballot as its standard-bearer, the candidate announced this week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGeorge Wallace, a segregationist Alabama governor who opposed federal civil rights laws, helped found the party and ran on its ticket in the 1968 presidential campaign. Kennedy\u2019s father, a staunch supporter of such rights, was assassinated in Los Angeles during that campaign.\n\nLeaders of the party, which currently exists only in California, say it has disavowed its segregationist roots and is focused on conservatism and the Constitution. In a video Kennedy released Tuesday, he called Wallace a \u201cbigot\u201d who \u201cwas antithetical to everything my father believed in.\u201d\n\nMainstream Democrats are incredulous about Kennedy\u2019s association with the party. When Wallace stood in a schoolhouse door at the University of Alabama, trying to block two Black students from registering, President Kennedy called in the Alabama National Guard at a time when his brother, Robert, was the nation\u2019s attorney general.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPaul Mitchell, a veteran Democratic strategist, said he previously believed Kennedy had a shot at winning California based purely on his last name. That is no longer the case, based on how he has run his campaign and whom he has chosen to associate with, Mitchell said.\n\n\u201cIf he was a Kennedy and acting like a Kennedy and professional, I wouldn\u2019t put [a California victory] out of the bounds,\u201d said Mitchell, who noted that Kennedy associated with the fringe party after gathering a paltry number of signatures for a political party he was trying to form. \u201cNow he\u2019s a loony anti-vaxxer conspiracy theorist and running a campaign like a loon. It\u2019s so embarrassing.\u201d\n\nBiden supporters have been concerned about Kennedy for some time. The Democratic National Committee earlier this year established a team to oppose third-party candidates, chiefly Kennedy. Their first act was filing a Federal Election Commission complaint arguing that Kennedy\u2019s campaign coordinated inappropriately with a Super PAC to qualify Kennedy for some states\u2019 ballots.\n\n\u201cWe know this is going to be a close election and we\u2019re not going to take anything for granted,\u201d said Matt Corridoni, a DNC spokesman working on the anti-third party effort, noting that the biggest donor to a pro-Kennedy PAC is a Trump mega-donor and that a New York-based campaign official pitched his candidacy by arguing that Kennedy would help Trump defeat Biden.\n\nIn April, several members of the Kennedy family endorsed Biden, including Kerry Kennedy, sister of the presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cWe want to make crystal clear our feelings that the best way forward for America is to reelect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for four more years,\u201d she said at a campaign event in Philadelphia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Wednesday, Kennedy challenged Biden to agree that whichever of them did worse in a head-to-head poll in the fall would drop out of the race to prevent Trump being elected to a second term.\n\nBut Republicans including Trump have recently signaled growing concern about Kennedy eating into the former president\u2019s support.\n\n\u201cRFK Jr. is a Democrat \u2018Plant,\u2019 a Radical Left Liberal who\u2019s been put in place in order to help Crooked Joe Biden, the Worst President in the History of the United States, get Re-Elected,\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social on April 26, arguing that the candidate opposes gun rights and the military and supports raising taxes, open borders and radical environmental policy. \u201cA Vote for Junior would essentially be a WASTED PROTEST VOTE, that could swing either way, but would only swing against the Democrats if Republicans knew the true story about him.\u201d\n\nTrump posted that before a Monmouth University poll released Monday found that after voters were told about Kennedy\u2019s skepticism of vaccines, their views changed \u2014 prior polling showed that Kennedy pulled support evenly from Biden and Trump.\n\nIn the new poll, the percentage of Republicans who said they would support Kennedy nearly doubled to almost one out of five after being told about his views about vaccines, while Democrats\u2019 support dropped sharply to roughly 10%.\n\nKennedy has also been receiving attention on conservative media, such as Wednesday evening on \u201cJesse Watters Primetime\u201d on Fox News Channel, where he argued that his campaign\u2019s polling shows him winning in a head-to-head matchup against either Biden or Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut \u201cif I\u2019m in the race, in a three-way race, I lose because people are voting out of fear, because they think the other guy \u2014 a vote for me is going to put somebody they hate in office,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if I go head to head with either of them, I win.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s advisors are piqued by Kennedy receiving attention from such outlets.\n\n\u201cFor the life of me, I can\u2019t understand why anyone on a conservative platform would feature the likes of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who believes the NRA is a terrorist organization, whose positions on the environment are more radical than [Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez], and who believes in a 70% tax bracket,\u201d said Chris LaCivita, a lead strategist for Trump\u2019s campaign and the Republican National Committee\u2019s chief of staff.\n\n\u201cFrom our standpoint, only one person is more liberal than Joe Biden and that\u2019s Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,\u201d LaCivita said, adding that Kennedy \u201cis a blank canvas and we are going to fill it with paint.\u201d",

Tim Scott\n\nIf Trump seeks a historic pick, he could make Scott the Republicans' first Black vice presidential candidate.\n\nScott, who once competed against Trump for the 2024 GOP nomination, ultimately hit the campaign trail for his former rival in the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries.\n\nOn the other hand: Trump has suggested he doesn't want an heir apparent running mate who has designs on the 2028 presidential election, and Scott could fall into that category if he decides to launch another White House bid.\n\nThat's the reason prominent figures like former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson keep popping up. Carson is not expected to launch another White House campaign \u2013 and he's not scheduled to attend the donor retreat this weekend.\n\nSen. J.D. Vance\n\nVance, a first-term senator, has been particularly vocal about defending Trump against his indictments in four separate criminal cases, including the ongoing hush money trial in New York.\n\nA frequent television news guest, Vance's stock rose this week after reporters obtained an invitation showing that he would headline a fundraiser for the former president in Cincinnati on May 15. Vance is also friends with a key figure in Trump's orbit: Donald Trump Jr.\n\nVance told Fox News and CNN this week that he has not talked with Trump about the running mate position.\n\n\"Of course, if he asked me, I'd have to think seriously about it because I think it's really important that he win,\" Vance told \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\nRep. Elise Stefanik\n\nTrump could also make history by picking a woman, and Stefanik has been on his potential list for months.\n\nA member of House leadership, Stefanik endorsed Trump early, campaigned aggressively for him in New Hampshire and often speaks to conservative groups like the RNC donor conference this weekend in Palm Beach.\n\nStefanik has also been a vocal critic of Trump's criminal cases, to the point of filing a legal complaint against special counsel Jack Smith. He is the lead prosecutor in the cases alleging Trump mishandled classified information and tried to steal the 2020 election.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio\n\nRubio, a senator from the state where the GOP donor conference is being held, would also make history as the first Latino person on a national ticket.\n\nA Trump-Rubio duo could raise a legal problem because they both live in Florida. Some attorneys believe running mates from the same state might be forced to forfeit that state's electoral votes. That's why running mate Dick Cheney moved residency from Texas back to Wyoming when former President George W. Bush tapped him in 2000.\n\nThe Florida problem might also affect the chances of another GOP lawmaker and potential running mate who plans to attend the donor retreat: U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla.\n\nNorth Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum\n\nThere are always long-shot candidates \u2013 for example, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin in 2008 \u2013 and Burgum is one of the speakers at the weekend soiree.\n\nTrump could consider the fact that the North Dakota governor endorsed and spoke on his behalf at an event the day before the Iowa caucuses. Burgum has been more enthusiastic for Trump than other former 2024 candidates who are not being considered for running mate, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.\n\nAnother politician not on Trump's list: former Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nPence turned against Trump over the latter's demand in 2021 that his vice president try to throw out the electoral votes that elected Biden to the presidency, a step Pence insisted he never legally could have taken. Trump has also appeared indifferent after mobs threatened Pence's life as they invaded the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nSouth Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem\n\nNoem will appear at this weekend's conference at a fraught time for her vice presidential prospects after a story in her new book revealed she shot the family dog because it kept attacking people and livestock.\n\nThe story prompted criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike. Donald Trump Jr., on his podcast \"Triggered,\" called the revelation \"not ideal.\"\n\nIn an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity, Noem, who described the dog as dangerous, said: \"It's an unfortunate situation, but one that I hope people understand. ... They need to hear the truth and not what the media has been spinning.\"\n\nPlenty of advice for Trump\n\nAs he assesses his options, Trump is getting plenty of advice from associates, lawmakers and donors about whom he should pick.\n\nSome of the potential choices are not scheduled to be in Palm Beach this weekend, including Arkansas Gov. Sarah Sanders (a former Trump press secretary), Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard.\n\nOn his radio show, Donald Trump Jr. told former Trump adviser Steve Bannon that his father should \"accelerate\" the running mate decision, especially given the fact that Trump is tied up in court.\n\n'You\u2019ve got a deep bench to do it,\" Bannon replied. \"You\u2019ve got great people, J.D. Vance, Gov. Burgum of North Dakota. You know, you\u2019ve got Dr. Carson, others.\u201d\n\nOthers said there's no telling when Trump will make his decision.\n\nNewt Gingrich, whom Trump considered for running mate in 2016, said the former president will act when he's ready.\n\n\"I\u2019m relaxing and watching to see what (Trump) does; he will only do it out of intuition,\" Gingrich told USA TODAY. \"I suspect that he\u2019s looking at (Marco) Rubio, he\u2019s looking at Scott, Tim Scott, and I think he\u2019s probably looking at a couple of women candidates, but I think he\u2019s going to think it through at his own pace. I think he\u2019s in no hurry.\u201d",

        "text": "US Republicans are exploiting pro-Palestinian protests on campuses\nRepublican Lauren Boebert (Colorado), during a visit to a pro-Palestinian student encampment on the campus of George Washington University, May 1, in Washington. DREW ANGERER / AFP\n\nProtests on many US campuses against the war in Gaza have delighted Republicans. The woke bogeyman is back. In their eyes, there's nothing like the classic partisan culture war for attacking the Democrats for what they see as undue leniency and tolerance toward the violent far left. As the Columbia University encampment in New York was being evacuated on the evening of April 30, the three main news channels were broadcasting special editions. CNN even had three reporters on campus. But it was Fox News that seemed most inspired by the event.\n\nThe on-screen banner labeled the protestors as \"anti-Israel\" demonstrators. On air, Donald Trump's shadow adviser Stephen Miller asserted that this is all because of Joe Biden. He accused Biden and his party of blowing on the embers of anti-Semitism. According to Miller, campuses have fallen into tyranny and anarchy, and free access to classrooms is in danger. Famed presenter Sean Hannity spoke in grave tones of tragic times. \"America right now doesn't seem to have moral clarity,\" he said, as he greeted an unexpected guest on the phone: Donald Trump, who was busy that day as a defendant in a Manhattan courthouse. \"I think you have a lot of paid agitators,\" asserted the former president. The proof, according to him is evident in signs that carried identical slogans.\n\nPressed to turn the page on the new military aid to Ukraine, which he had helped promote, House Speaker Mike Johnson was the first to take up the subject. On April 24, he took to the steps of Columbia University to call on its president, Nemat Shafik, to resign if she failed to \"immediately bring order to this chaos.\" On Wednesday, by a vote of 320 to 91, the House passed a bill to combat anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial on campus.\n\n'Mental illness'\n\nWhile Biden is seeking a balanced position, defending freedom of expression while denouncing hate speech and hateful acts, Republicans aren't bothering with nuance. Ohio Republican Senator J.D. Vance claimed that participating in such encampments falls under \"mental illness.\" We can't recall such vigorous condemnations of Trump, when he dined at Mar-a-Lago in November 2022 with supremacist and anti-Semite Nick Fuentes. Since then, the former president has constantly questioned the loyalty of US Jews. \"Any Jewish person that votes for a Democrat or votes for Biden should have their head examined,\" he said, on April 10.\n\nRepublicans are all the more delighted with the current situation because they are presenting a united front, in contrast to the divided Democrats. Conservatives have taken note of the large number of white protest votes cast against the Biden administration, in connection with the war in Gaza, during the Democratic primaries in several states. Pressure is also mounting among left-wing members of Congress to question the unconditional nature of military aid to Israel. Even though Biden is maintaining a highly pro-Israel line, despite the massive war crimes committed in Gaza, he is now being attacked for his lack of commitment by certain Republicans.\n\nYou have 32.79% of this article left to read.

        "text": "Global trade and immigration on the line in Panama\u2019s presidential vote\nCNN \u2014\n\nPanama, the Central American nation at the crossroads of international trade and migration, will elect a new president on Sunday after a campaign season mired in legal uncertainty.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very important election, the most important since after the US invasion\u201d in 1989, said Daniel Zovatto, a global fellow with the Latin America Program at the Wilson Center, a think tank.\n\n\u201cThe situation is very complex and the next president, whoever is elected, is going to have an agenda overloaded with problems in a country that is very polarized and undergoing a lot of political tension and uncertainty,\u201d he added.\n\nAt stake is the financial stewardship of a country of 4.4 million people, which is facing high inflation and a stagnating economy that has led to widespread unease. Water access will also factor high into voter\u2019s minds, analysts say: droughts exacerbated by El Nino have made access to potable water scarce in some regions and reduced the capacity of the Panama Canal, a centerpiece of the country\u2019s GDP.\n\nOnce a GDP leader in the region, Panama\u2019s economy has slowed dramatically in recent years, with the IMF forecasting GDP growth of only 2.5 percent this year, down from 7.3 percent last year. In March, credit agency Fitch downgraded Panama\u2019s rating to junk status citing \u201cfiscal and governance challenges\u201d that followed a controversial decision to close the country\u2019s largest mine last year.\n\nAmong the favorites, Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino, a rightwing former public security minister, has pledged to return the country to its economic heyday and to tackle high unemployment with a plan to incentivize private hiring with government funds.\n\nAchieving Goals presidential candidate Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino speaks with reporters after meeting with members of the Electoral Observation Mission, in Panama City, Wednesday, May 1, 2024. Matias Delacroix/AP\n\nMore controversially, Mulino has also vowed to shut down the Dari\u00e9n Gap, the treacherous stretch of jungle beginning in Panama that\u2019s become a main highway for migrants making their way to the US \u2013 a phenomenon that is fueling political chaos in the United States as Americans prepare for their own presidential vote this fall.\n\nMore than half a million migrants, mostly from Venezuela, crossed through the Dari\u00e9n Gap in 2023, according to the Panamanian government, twice the amount recorded in 2022. The US has been working for months with officials in Panama and Colombia, where the jungle ends, to attempt to shut down the route.\n\nMulino has not said how he would carry out a closure of the jungle to migrants, and some analysts \u201cquestion whether this would stem migration or simply prompt new routes,\u201d an Americas Society/Council of the Americas report said.\n\nCorruption at the top of ballot issues\n\nFor Panamanian voters, corruption is top of mind as they head to the polls, according to recent Gallup polling, followed by unemployment, unsatisfactory medical care, and the cost of living.\n\nThe case of former President Ricardo Martinelli, who was disqualified from running by the courts because of a past corruption conviction, stands out.\n\nMartinelli was sentenced to more than 10 years in prison last year after being convicted of money laundering in the so-called \u201cNew Business\u201d corruption scandal.\n\nThe case related to a publishing group that, according to the country\u2019s public ministry, was purchased with funds that came from state contracts that were handled irregularly. Martinelli, who maintains his innocence, is currently taking refuge from local authorities in Nicaragua\u2019s embassy in the Panama City, and Nicaraguan authorities have granted him asylum.\n\nOnce the favorite to win this year\u2019s presidential race, Martinelli was disqualified from running by Panama\u2019s electoral court in March because of the conviction and sentence. Mulino, who had been Martinelli\u2019s running mate, then took over the ticket for the Achieving Goals party.\n\nBut Mulino\u2019s candidacy was challenged as well and under judicial review until just days before the election, injecting uncertainty into the race. On Friday, the country\u2019s Supreme Court decided that Mulino\u2019s candidacy was constitutional and therefore could proceed.\n\nThere are seven other presidential candidates, including current Vice-President Jos\u00e9 Gabriel Carrizo, former President Mart\u00edn Torrijos, and R\u00f3mulo Roux, another former minister under Martinelli. There is no presidential runoff in Panama and no minimum threshold to win, so an eventual victor could succeed with far less than majority support from the electorate.\n\nMartinelli has thrown his support behind Mulino, even releasing campaign videos from inside the Nicaraguan embassy.\n\nMulino in turn is widely seen as having inherited Martinelli\u2019s popular support and mirroring his plans to revive policies from the president, which is \u201cremembered largely for economic growth and poverty reduction, which resonates with voters facing high inflation and unemployment rates,\u201d Americas Quarterly wrote.",

        "text": "A group of Republicans has united to defend the legitimacy of US elections and those who run them\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 It was Election Day last November, and one of Georgia\u2019s top election officials saw that reports of a voting machine problem in an eastern Pennsylvania county were gaining traction online.\n\nSo Gabriel Sterling, a Republican who had defended the 2020 election in Georgia amid an onslaught of threats, posted a message to his nearly 71,000 followers on the social platform X explaining what had happened and saying that all votes would be counted correctly.\n\nHe faced immediate criticism from one commenter about why he was weighing in on another state\u2019s election while other responses reiterated false claims about widespread fraud in the 2020 presidential election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still the right thing to do,\u201d Sterling told a gathering the following day, stressing the importance of Republican officials speaking up to defend elections. \u201cWe have to be prepared to say over and over again -- other states are doing it different than us, but they are not cheating.\u201d\n\nSterling, the chief operating officer for the Georgia Secretary of State\u2019s Office, is part of an effort begun after the last presidential election that seeks to bring together Republican officials who are willing to defend the country\u2019s election systems and the people who run them. They want officials to reinforce the message that elections are secure and accurate, an approach they say is especially important as the country heads toward another divisive presidential contest.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nThe group has held meetings in several states, with more planned before the Nov. 5 election.\n\nWith six months to go before the likely rematch between Democratic President Joe Biden and former Republican President Donald Trump, concerns are running high among election officials that public distrust of voting and ballot counting persists, particularly among Republicans. Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee, continues to sow doubts about the last presidential election and is warning his followers \u2014 without citing any evidence \u2014 that Democrats will try to cheat in the upcoming one.\n\nThis past week, during a campaign rally in Michigan, Trump repeated his false claim that Democrats rigged the 2020 election. \u201cBut we\u2019re not going to allow them to rig the presidential election,\u201d he said.\n\nFILE - Utah Lt.

Don\u2019t stay at home.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe effort, which began about 18 months ago, is coordinated by the SNF Agora Institute at Johns Hopkins University and the center-right think tank R Street Institute. The goal has been to start conversations about trust in elections, primarily among conservative officials, and to develop a set of principles to accomplish that.\n\n\u201cThis has never been and will never be about Trump specifically,\u201d said Matt Germer, director of governance for the R Street Institute and a lead organizer of the effort. \u201cIt\u2019s about democratic principles at a higher level \u2013- what does it mean to be a conservative who believes in democracy, the rule of law?\u201d\n\nHe said an aim is to have a structure in place to support election officials who might find themselves in situations like that of Georgia\u2019 secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger in 2020, when he supported Trump but rejected false claims that the election was stolen. Prosecutors in Georgia have since charged Trump and others, alleging a plot to overturn the results. Trump has pleaded not guilty.\n\nFILE - Kentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams speaks during an interview in Lexington, Ky., May 8, 2023.

But he said he would remain cautious of speaking directly about something specific happening in another state.\n\n\u201cIf I start going beyond my realm and my role, then they don\u2019t trust me. And if they don\u2019t trust me, then they don\u2019t trust the elections in Kansas, and that\u2019s pretty important,\u201d Schwab said in an interview.\n\nSome election officials who have questioned election procedures outside their state have a different perspective.\n\nSecretary of State Mac Warner of West Virginia, a Republican who has questioned the legitimacy of the 2020 election, said the focus should be on improving policies, such as putting in place voter ID requirements across the country, not silencing those who have questions.\n\n\u201cOur primary job as election officials is to build confidence, and that comes from strengthening protocols and not weakening them,\u201d he said.\n\nOhio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican who has raised questions about the way elections are run in other states, criticized what he called \u201cactivist lawsuits\u201d and state officials who seek to change voting rules previously set by legislators.\n\n\u201cThe things that happen in other states that go wrong are not the result of some cloak and dagger, secretive cabal conspiracy,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThat\u2019s the far-fetched stuff that makes for great YouTube videos and what have you. But the real things that go wrong in other states, are out in the open, are in full public view.\u201d\n\nUtah Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson, a Republican who is the state\u2019s top election official and has been participating in the group\u2019s discussions, said avoiding criticism of other states and vouching for the legitimacy of election procedures is important for another reason: It can help reduce the threats and harassment directed toward election workers.\n\nA recent survey by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University\u2019s Law School found that nearly 40% of local election officials had experienced such abuse. It\u2019s caused many to leave their jobs. Of 29 clerks in Utah, Henderson said 20 are new since 2020 and nine have never overseen an election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to suggest that someone could do something better. It\u2019s another thing to impugn their integrity, their character, accuse them of cheating, accuse them of nefarious things that don\u2019t happen,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cIt\u2019s exhausting.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Julie Carr Smyth in Columbus, Ohio, contributed to this report.",

However, the \u201cDreamers\u201d were still ineligible for government-subsidized health insurance programs because they did not meet the definition of having a \u201clawful presence\u201d in the U.S.\n\nThe administration decided not to expand eligibility for Medicaid for those migrants after receiving more than 20,000 comments on the proposal, senior officials said Thursday. Those officials declined to explain why the rule, which was first proposed last April, took so long to finalize. The delay meant the migrants were unable to enroll in the marketplace for coverage this year.\n\nAt one point, there were as many as 800,000 people enrolled in DACA at one time, though now that figure is roughly 580,000. The administration predicts only 100,000 will actually sign up because some may get coverage through their workplaces or other ways. Some may also be unable to afford coverage through the marketplace.\n\nOther classes of immigrants, including asylum seekers and people with temporary protected status, are already eligible to purchase insurance through the marketplaces of the ACA, Obama\u2019s 2010 health care law, often called \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\nThe president last year also unveiled a regulation that was aimed at fending off legal challenges to DACA; former President Donald Trump tried to end it, and it has bounced back and forth in federal court. Last fall, a federal judge said the current version can continue at least temporarily.\n\n\u201cPresident Biden and I will continue to do everything in our power to protect DACA, but it is only a temporary solution,\u201d Vice President Kamala Harris said in a statement. \u201cCongress must act to ensure Dreamers have the permanent protections they deserve.\u201d",

With Florida Governor Ron DeSantis dropping out of the race two days earlier, Republican presidential candidates former President Donald Trump and former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley are battling it out in this first-in-the-nation primary.\n\n2014 was the first year Lonna Atkeson remembers receiving hate mail.\n\nAtkeson, a political scientist who researches election surveys and public opinion, has been conducting voter polls since 2004. She is currently a professor at Florida State University and has authored several books.\n\nBut a decade into her polling work, she said, the angry messages began rolling in.\n\n\"I started getting letters from people saying, 'You're part of the problem. You're not part of the solution. I'm not going to answer your surveys anymore. You're an evil academic trying to brainwash our children,'\" Atkeson recalled in an interview with CNBC.\n\nFor Atkeson, those notes marked a shift: a more polarized electorate had begun to lose faith in institutions like polling and voters might no longer be as willing to talk to her.\n\nAt the same time, technology was advancing and landlines or mail were no longer foolproof ways to get in touch with survey respondents.\n\n\"People were not answering their phones,\" Rachael Cobb, a political science professor at Suffolk University, told CNBC. \"Even in the last 10 years, you might try 20 callers to get the one that you need. Now, it's double: 40 callers to get what you need. So every poll takes longer and it's more expensive.\"\n\nPolarization and technology are among the obstacles that pollsters cite as complicating the task of taking accurate voter surveys.\n\nAs a result, over the past several election cycles, polling organizations have made some major mistakes.\n\n\"If you look at some of the big misses, I mean, they're pretty big,\" Atkeson said.",

Their turnout is quite low\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alex Wong/Getty Images Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nBURLINGTON, Vt. \u2014 Three cities in Vermont now allow non-U.S. citizen residents to vote in local elections.\n\nWinooski is one of those municipalities. It just held its third local election with noncitizen voting.\n\n\"Thirteen hundred and 45 people participated in our annual city and school election,\" Winooski Clerk Jenny Willingham said about March's contests. \"Eleven of those ballots cast were from our all-resident voting,\" a category that includes green-card holders, refugees and asylum-seekers.\n\nIn Vermont and elsewhere, municipalities that allow noncitizen voting in local elections have seen similar low voter registration rates and turnout. Local leaders are trying to parse out why.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThat's as noncitizen voting has emerged as a national flashpoint this election year. Republicans including former President Donald Trump are pushing legislation aimed at stopping noncitizens from voting in federal elections \u2014 which is already illegal and, by all accounts, very rare.\n\nSmall numbers of ballots cast\n\nIn Winooski, getting those 11 noncitizen votes cast in March's races took a lot of legwork for Willingham. She had the ballots printed in 12 languages and had four interpreters \u2014 speaking Burmese, Nepali, Swahili and Somali \u2014 working on Election Day.\n\nBurlington, Vermont's largest city, counted 62 votes by noncitizens, accounting for less than half of 1% of the nearly 15,000 total votes cast.\n\nIn Montpelier, the state's capital, 13 noncitizens voted. There are so few noncitizen registered voters that Clerk John Odum keeps their paperwork in a half-inch blue binder.\n\nThis trend extends outside Vermont. Takoma Park, Md., legalized local noncitizen voting 30 years ago. Still, registration and turnout remain relatively low.\n\nThere are ongoing grassroots efforts in Vermont to increase voter participation among green-card holders, refugees and asylum-seekers. The League of Women Voters distributes pamphlets and holds info sessions.\n\nThe city of Burlington pays outreach workers like Jules Wetchi, an immigrant from the Democratic Republic of Congo, to connect with immigrant communities. Wetchi hosts local radio and TV shows geared at French-speaking new Americans.\n\ntoggle caption Sophie Stephens/Vermont Public\n\n\"I did what they call civic education to push people to know how they should be engaged to vote, because it's very important,\" Wetchi said. \"This is our second country. We are living here \u2014 we should be more engaged to the political situation.\"\n\nFear as a barrier to voting\n\nBut Wetchi said fear is one of the barriers to the ballot box. People have told him they're afraid they might get harassed when they vote. Others worry that voting might negatively affect their U.S. citizenship application, even if their city clerk assures them that it won't.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSome of that fear stems from the national spotlight on this issue, which got brighter last month when Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson pushed a measure that would add citizenship documentation requirements for voters.\n\nVermont Secretary of State Sarah Copeland Hanzas, a Democrat, said she understands why some Vermonters are reluctant to have their names on a list of non-U.S. citizens that's accessible with a public records request.\n\n\"We are a nation of immigrants. So it's wild to imagine how we got to this place where we have to worry about these things,\" she said.\n\nWinooski and Montpelier were sued by the state and national Republican parties to try to stop local noncitizen voting. The lawsuits were thrown out, but Copeland Hanzas wondered whether they added to the chilling effect.\n\n\"I'm quite certain that there are more folks who would have been eligible to vote in those local elections,\" she said.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., Republicans in Congress are trying to block a law that allows noncitizens to vote in local D.C. elections. The law went into effect in January. As of April 30, there were 372 noncitizens registered in a city with around 450,000 total registered voters.\n\nD.C. Board of Elections staff members are doing their best to keep their heads down and not let the controversy affect their work, said Executive Director Monica Holman Evans.\n\n\"I receive the quote-unquote attacks or the quote-unquote comments, commentary, opinions about it,\" she said. \"And I'm just very clear that I don't take an opinion on this or any other legislation that has been passed in the District of Columbia. Our job is to enforce what's currently in effect.\"\n\nVermont's local election officials also said they feel the heat from the national spotlight. They know that one slip-up, like a presidential ballot being mailed to a noncitizen, could end up on the national news.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nLarger jurisdictions like D.C. have voter databases that can track noncitizen voters. Vermont doesn't yet; the secretary of state's office said one is in the works.\n\nIn the meantime, clerks use Excel spreadsheets and three-ring binders to track noncitizen voters. Willingham, Winooski's clerk, keeps her noncitizen voter registrations in a manila folder in a filing cabinet next to her desk.\n\n\"I feel like I check and then I recheck just to make sure that everything is correct, that they are only voting in the elections that our charter has declared,\" she said.\n\nDespite the low turnout, the mere fact that noncitizen voting is on the books means a lot to many immigrants in Vermont. Wetchi's mother recently made the move to Vermont from the Democratic Republic of Congo. She speaks only Swahili and a local dialect, but Wetchi said he hopes she can vote one day.\n\n\"Because her voice is very important. Her voice can change many things,\" he said.\n\nThe thing is, Wetchi and his family just moved to the city of South Burlington, which doesn't have noncitizen voting. His mom can't vote there. But he can \u2014 he's a full citizen. He's even thinking about running for office one day.",

        "text": "What happens if a US presidential candidate dies?\nAmericans are bracing for a rare presidential rematch between the two oldest candidates in US history: the 81-year-old president Joe Biden and the 77-year-old former president Donald Trump.\n\nConcerns about their age, mental fitness and the possibility that Trump could be convicted of a felony and sentenced to prison time before election day have raised questions about what would happen in the extraordinary event that one of them dies, becomes incapacitated or abruptly withdraws.\n\nIf Biden, as the sitting president, were to die the vice-president, Kamala Harris, would assume the powers of the presidency under the 25th amendment. But replacing Biden or Trump as their party\u2019s presumptive nominees for president \u2013 a prospect that is entirely hypothetical \u2013 is more complicated. In the event of an unforeseen vacancy, party rules, state and federal election laws and the US constitution would guide what would undoubtedly be a messy process.\n\nWhat happens if Biden or Trump needs to be replaced?\n\nThe answer, experts say, depends largely on when the vacancy arises. Is it after the party\u2019s nominating convention? Before election day? What if the winning candidate is no longer able to take the oath of office? The timing matters.\n\nIf the unexpected occurs, the job of replacing the presidential candidate would fall to \u201c10,000 people who no one has ever heard of\u201d, according to Elaine Kamarck, a member of the Democratic National Committee rules committee and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Collectively they represent convention delegates, members of the parties\u2019 national committees, the 538 members of the electoral college and the 435 members of the House of Representatives.\n\nEach plays a relevant role at different stages of the election process.\n\nWhat if it happens before a party\u2019s convention?\n\nBiden and Trump have secured enough delegates to be their parties\u2019 nominee in mid-March, but neither will be formally selected until the conventions this summer. The Republican national convention will take place in Milwaukee in mid-July. The Democratic convention will take place a month later in Chicago.\n\nBefore then, state parties will continue to hold primaries, caucuses and conventions, electing delegates to send to conventions.\n\nIf Biden or Trump were to withdraw or die before being formally nominated, their delegates would arrive at the convention in Milwaukee or Chicago largely uncommitted. A replacement nominee would then probably be chosen at the convention in a messy floor fight. Imagine frantic horse-trading, back-room dealing and public speech-making.\n\nDemocrats also have a system of \u201csuperdelegates\u201d \u2013 unpledged senior party officials and elected leaders whose support is limited on the first ballot but who could play a decisive role in subsequent rounds.\n\nWould the running mate automatically move to the top of the ticket?\n\nThe short answer is no. Neither Harris, nor Trump\u2019s eventual vice-presidential pick, would automatically become the nominee, according to DNC and RNC rules.\n\nBut delegates tend to be people with a degree of loyalty to the candidate or party. So in all likelihood, the running mate would emerge as a strong contender for the nomination.\n\nPresumably a Biden delegate would be open to supporting Harris, who, in the event Biden has died or fallen critically ill, would already be serving as president. Nevertheless, if a vacancy emerges, it is possible alternative candidates would step forward \u2013 imagine the California governor, Gavin Newsom, or his Michigan counterpart, Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nOn the Republican side, Trump has yet to choose a running mate. The runner-up for the Republican nomination, Nikki Haley, proved deeply unpopular with the party\u2019s base and could struggle to win over Trump\u2019s delegates if he were not the nominee.\n\nHas this happened before?\n\nMany Americans will have no memory of the 1968 Democratic primary, when President Lyndon Johnson announced he would not seek re-election after only narrowly winning the party\u2019s New Hampshire primary contest in March. Weeks prior, Senator Robert F Kennedy had launched his campaign for the party\u2019s presidential nomination. He was assassinated in June, after winning the California primary.\n\nJohnson\u2019s vice-president, Hubert Humphrey, eventually accumulated enough delegates through the support of party insiders to win the Democratic nomination. But the convention that year was so disastrous for the party, which went on to lose the presidential election, it prompted an overhaul of the entire primary system, resulting in the contest-driven nominating process in place today.\n\nWhat if a vacancy arises after the convention but before election day?\n\nHere again the political parties would play a central role.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee have slightly different rules guiding how they would replace the deceased presidential nominee by majority vote.\n\nAccording to party rules, the DNC has the power to fill the vacancy on their party ticket after the chair consults Democratic governors and congressional leaders. The RNC, according to its rules, could reconvene a national convention or select the alternative candidate itself.\n\nFor simplicity, the parties would probably consider the running mate, but there is no guarantee.\n\nIf there were enough time, the replacement candidate might appear on the ballot. But states have different ballot filing deadlines and several states begin mailing their ballots as early as September.\n\nIn states where ballots have already been printed or mailed, the party could instruct voters \u2013 and electors \u2013 to treat the names at the top of the ticket \u201cas hieroglyphics\u201d, said Derek Muller, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame.\n\n\u201cIf it says Biden-Harris, you should interpret that as Harris-Booker,\u201d he said, offering the hypothetical example of an alternative Democratic ticket with the New Jersey senator Cory Booker as Harris\u2019s running mate.\n\nHas this ever happened before?\n\nNo. But there are some examples of how this might play out.\n\nIn 1972, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, Senator Thomas Eagleton, was forced to withdraw from the ticket after the convention following reports that had been treated for mental illness. The Democratic National Committee convened a meeting in Washington to select Eagleton\u2019s replacement, Sargent Shriver.\n\nExperts also point to 2000, when the Democratic candidate for a Senate seat in Missouri, the state\u2019s governor, Mel Carnahan, died weeks before the election. The state\u2019s lieutenant governor, a Democrat who ascended to the governorship, committed to appointing Carnahan\u2019s wife, Jean, to the seat if he won posthumously, which he did. She was then appointed to fill her late husband\u2019s seat.\n\n\u201cThe electorate can learn about these things if given the cues to do so,\u201d Muller said.\n\nCould Congress delay the election?\n\nIt is possible but improbable. The date of the election is set by federal law, the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, which is 5 November.\n\nBoth chambers of Congress would have to approve a measure delaying the election, and the president would have to sign it, unlikely in a divided government.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Trump on Trial Free newsletter Stay up to date on all of Donald Trump\u2019s trials.

The rules and laws would still apply. But the scenario takes on a new degree of complexity.\n\n\u201cAll of these questions become much more complicated in situations where you have a disability or you\u2019re physically unable to take the oath,\u201d Muller said. \u201cThere are just more contingencies in place that you don\u2019t have when it comes to death.\u201d\n\nIt is important to remember how the presidential election process works. To win the White House, a candidate must accumulate a majority of electors \u2013 270 \u2013 in the electoral college. In each state, political parties choose slates of electors and voters cast their ballot for a party\u2019s electors.\n\n\u201cWhen you vote for president, you\u2019re actually not voting for Joe Biden or Donald Trump,\u201d Kamarck said. \u201cYou are voting for a slate of electors who have been chosen in that state as part of the electoral college.\u201d\n\nAfter the election, the winning presidential candidate\u2019s slate of electors, generally party loyalists vetted by local party leaders for the role, meet in their states to cast their votes for president and vice-president. This year, that occurs on 17 December.\n\nSome states \u201cbind\u201d electors to vote for the winner of the election in their state, laws that were upheld by the supreme court in a 2020 ruling, but other states allow electors more independence to cast \u201cfaithless votes\u201d. The supreme court justice Elena Kagan added in a footnote that \u201cnothing in this opinion should be taken to permit the states to bind electors to a deceased candidate\u201d.\n\nIf the electors haven\u2019t met when the vacancy occurs, they would be strongly incentivized to coalesce around a replacement candidate designated by the party. The running mate would be an obvious choice, but, again, not the required one.\n\nThe electors could also decide to back the deceased candidate and under the 20th amendment the vice-president-elect would become the president-elect. More on this later.\n\nA newly elected Congress will meet on 6 January to certify the results of the presidential election by counting the electoral votes. Traditionally this has been a ceremonial affair. But in 2020, a violent mob of Trump supporters overran the US Capitol in a failed attempt to prevent Congress from certifying Biden\u2019s victory.\n\nIn this polarized and charged environment, there are concerns about how elected officials in Congress would handle a situation in which the winner of the electoral college vote cannot assume the presidency. Reforms made after the 6 January insurrection on the Capitol made it harder for members of Congress to object to the counting of certain electoral votes, a partisan practice.\n\nBut Congress would be operating in uncharted territory.\n\nIs there a precedent?\n\nNo. No winning presidential candidate has died in the period between election day at the start of November and the inauguration on 20 January.\n\nBut there is one example of a losing presidential candidate dying after election day. In 1872, the Democratic presidential candidate Horace Greeley died after losing the election to Ulysses S Grant but before the casting of the electoral college votes. Although his death did not affect the outcome, there was a debate over what to do with the 66 electoral college votes he had won. Most electors chose to cast their votes for another candidate and Congress chose not to count the three votes cast for the deceased Greeley.\n\nSome experts say Congress\u2019s decision not to count the votes should not necessarily be taken as precedent, especially because it occurred before the 20th amendment was ratified. Others argue that members of Congress might have decided the matter differently if the votes would have affected the outcome.\n\nSo what does the 20th amendment say?\n\nSection 3 of the 20th amendment states: \u201cIf, at the time fixed for the beginning of the term of the President, the President elect shall have died, the Vice-President elect shall become President.\u201d\n\nBut there is some debate over when a winning candidate becomes president-elect. Is it after the electors vote on 17 December or not until a joint session of Congress counts the electoral votes on 6 January?\n\n\u201cThe balance of scholarly opinion holds that the president- and vice-president-elect are chosen once the electoral votes are cast,\u201d according to a 2020 Congressional Research Service memo. But the law itself leaves some ambiguity.\n\nHow will it look to voters?\n\nAmazingly, these are only some of the hypothetical scenarios that could unfold.\n\nIf the unexpected occurs, parties will jockey for political advantage and bad actors would probably try to seize on the chaos. This will be especially true in the event the election results are contested, as Trump is laying the groundwork to do, or in the \u201cnightmare scenario\u201d neither candidate earns 270 electoral votes.\n\nWith the election expected to be narrowly decided, there is no doubt an unexpected vacancy would jolt a system already rattled by an onslaught of spurious claims and political misinformation.\n\nHolly Idelson, a policy advocate with the non-partisan group Protect Democracy, said education and public awareness will be critical to defuse the potential for a \u201ccrisis atmosphere\u201d in the circumstance of a presidential candidate\u2019s death or withdrawal.\n\n\u201cYes, there are unprecedented scenarios that could arise, and yes, there may be genuine questions about how to apply the law, but in many cases there is law to apply,\u201d she said. \u201cWe should focus our efforts on promoting regular order rather than undue alarm.\u201d",

        "text": "US elections are six months away. How does the race stand and what\u2019s next?\nAs November vote nears, here are the key issues and challenges facing presumptive nominees Joe Biden and Donald Trump.\n\nA crackdown on pro-Palestinian student protests, Donald Trump\u2019s hush-money criminal trial, and political bickering over foreign aid and immigration have dominated headlines in the United States in recent weeks.\n\nThe issues have shone a spotlight on deep divisions in the country as it moves closer to what is expected to be a heated battle for the White House between incumbent President Joe Biden, a Democrat, and his Republican predecessor, Trump.\n\nBut for most people across the US, the presidential election on November 5 \u2014 exactly six months from Sunday \u2014 is not yet on their radars.\n\n\u201cIn the United States, most people still have not tuned in. Despite you, I and the political class, the vast majority of Americans are not paying attention to the election,\u201d said Erik Nisbet, a professor of policy analysis and communications at Northwestern University.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t tune in until September,\u201d he told Al Jazeera. \u201cAt this point though, it\u2019s important to get your narratives out. It\u2019s important to get your base solidified and mobilised.\u201d\n\nPerceptions of an \u2018Election 2.0\u2019\n\nMost polls show a tight race between Biden and Trump as the election nears, with experts saying the contest will likely come down to how the candidates fare in critical swing states like Michigan, Georgia and Nevada.\n\nBut there is also widespread frustration that the choice this election cycle is the same as in 2020, when Biden defeated Trump to win the White House.\n\nA recent Pew Research Center poll found that nearly half of all registered voters said they would replace both Biden and Trump on the ballot if they could.\n\nAbout two-thirds of respondents said they had little to no confidence that Biden is physically fit enough to be president, the poll said, while a similar number said they did not believe Trump would act ethically in office.\n\n\u201cIt is Election 2.0,\u201d said Jan Leighley, a political science professor at American University in Washington, DC.\n\n\u201cI think that creates a disincentive for voting, which again comes back on the campaigns to convince people that, even though it\u2019s the same choice, there\u2019s still a reason to vote.\u201d\n\nYouth vote\n\nFor the Biden camp, the message so far has been that a vote for the Democratic incumbent is a vote for democratic ideals. \u201cDemocracy is on the ballot. Your freedom is on the ballot,\u201d Biden said in January.\n\nBut that message is failing to resonate among key segments of the Democratic base who are angered by the Biden administration\u2019s unequivocal support for Israel amid its war in Gaza.\n\nThe recent wave of pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses has highlighted a generational divide over the US\u2019s relationship with Israel, and that, in turn, could pose a serious problem for Biden as he seeks the youth vote in November.\n\nIn 2020, Biden won about 60 percent support among voters aged 18 to 29.\n\nBut a recent CNN poll showed Biden trailing Trump \u2014 51 percent to 40 percent \u2014 among voters under age 35, and experts say a lack of enthusiasm among young voters could spell trouble.\n\n\u201cWe know how college students are feeling,\u201d said Hasan Pyarali, the Muslim Caucus chairperson for College Democrats of America, the university arm of the Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cAnd I can tell you for sure that there are too many who would stay home\u201d on November 5 if Biden does not change his Middle East policy, Pyarali added. \u201cI doubt that people would switch over to Trump, but they would certainly not vote.\u201d\n\nAccording to Nisbet at Northwestern University, Biden\u2019s campaign needs to focus in the coming months on \u201cgetting the Democratic house in order\u201d before it tries to appeal to the relatively small number of undecided voters in the country.\n\nAny protests at the Democratic National Convention, for example, could hurt him. Democrats will gather in Chicago in August to formally confirm Biden as their 2024 nominee.\n\n\u201cThe Democratic Party, or at least the Biden campaign, does not want any dissension within the [party] because it\u2019s a bad visual,\u201d said Nisbet.\n\nTrump\u2019s legal woes\n\nMeanwhile, on the Republican side, Trump\u2019s campaign has unfolded against unprecedented legal turmoil.\n\nThe former president faces four separate criminal cases, including an ongoing trial in New York over allegations he falsified business records related to a hush-money payment made to an adult film star.\n\nWhile the indictments have done little so far to dent Trump\u2019s support among Republican voters, some polling suggests that a chunk of the US electorate would not vote for him if he were convicted in any of the cases.\n\nTrump is expected to be confirmed as the Republican Party\u2019s 2024 nominee at the party\u2019s convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.\n\n\u201cThe conventions go on over the summer, but there\u2019s usually not a whole lot of activity campaign-wise,\u201d said Leighley at American University.\n\nBut this year might be different, given Trump\u2019s court hearings and the pressure on Biden over the Gaza war. \u201cThose could be unusual bumps, if you will, that provide campaigns opportunities to do more in terms of ads,\u201d she said.\n\nKey issues\n\nBoth Leighley and Nisbet said the US economy is always an important election issue, and it will continue to be a focus over the next few months of campaigning.\n\nDespite positive economic indicators, many Americans believe they are worse off now than when Trump was in the White House, recent polls have suggested.\n\n\u201cThere is a big gap where people, for whatever reason \u2014 it could be because of the economics, it could be a bias of memory \u2014 they look more favourably at Trump\u2019s then-presidency than Biden\u2019s current one overall,\u201d said Nisbet.\n\nHe added that the economy is hurting Biden among Latino and Black voters, as well as young people, all of whom are key segments of the Democratic base.\n\n\u201cTrump will want to talk about how bad the economy is,\u201d said Nisbet, while Biden\u2019s team instead will \u201ctry to change the conversation\u201d and pivot to other issues.\n\nThat includes access to abortion. Biden has made defending access to reproductive healthcare a central plank of his re-election campaign, repeatedly condemning Trump and Republican Party lawmakers for supporting abortion restrictions.\n\nIn 2022, under Trump, the US Supreme Court formed a conservative \u201csupermajority\u201d, allowing it to overturn Roe v Wade, a landmark 1973 ruling that established abortion access as a constitutional right.\n\nEliminating Roe had been a conservative priority for decades, and several Republican-led states have since enacted strict limits on abortion.\n\nAccording to Leighley, \u201cthere will be an emphasis on the issue of abortion and Trump\u2019s role in that and the Republican Party and its plans\u201d as the presidential campaigns inch closer to the fall months of September and October.\n\nDebate schedule\n\nThat is also when the first debate between Biden and Trump could take place.\n\nThe Commission on Presidential Debates reiterated on Wednesday that the first televised face-off between the candidates would take place on September 16, confirming dates announced late last year.\n\nThe announcement came after Trump\u2019s team had urged the commission to move the schedule forward.\n\nThere has been uncertainty around the 2024 debates, particularly as Trump eschewed participating in any during the Republican primary process. But last week, both Biden and Trump said they were up for it.\n\n\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know if either one wants them, but it is an American tradition \u2014 and I think it really would hurt American democracy if we did not have presidential debates,\u201d said Nesbit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a major aspect of our tradition in the United States. And having presidential debates, even if they don\u2019t change anyone\u2019s minds \u2014 and they rarely do \u2014 I think it\u2019s important for Americans to hear their two candidates at least air their perspectives.\u201d",

        "text": "6 months out, a tight presidential race with battle between issues and attributes: POLL\nLocked in a tight race for the presidency, Donald Trump prevails in trust to handle most issues in a new ABC News/Ipsos poll, yet President Joe Biden scores competitively on key personal attributes -- leaving wide open the question of who'll prevail come Election Day, now six months away.\n\nExcluding people who say they wouldn't vote, Trump has 46% support, Biden 44%, in this national survey of more than 2,200 adults. (Nearly all the rest say they'd pick someone else.) Among registered voters, it's Biden 46%, Trump 45%. Among likely voters, it's Biden 49%, Trump 45%, again not a significant difference.\n\n2024 Vote preference ABC News / IPSOS Poll\n\nSee PDF for full results.\n\nA five-way contest doesn't change the picture in this poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates with fieldwork by Ipsos. This finds the race at 42% for Trump and 40% for Biden, with 12% for Robert F. Kennedy Jr., 2% for Cornel West and 1% for Jill Stein. (That, of course, assumes Kennedy, West and Stein are on the ballot in all states, an open question.) Among registered voters in the five-way race, it's 42-42%, Biden-Trump, and Biden is a non-significant +3 or +4 points in likely voter models.\n\nKennedy gets 12% even though 77% of his supporters say they know \"just some\" or \"hardly anything\" about his positions on the issues. Notably, his supporters are more apt to be Republicans or GOP-leaning independents (54%) than Democrats and Democratic leaners (42%, a slight difference given sample sizes), and in a two-way race, they favor Trump over Biden by 13 points. That may explain why Trump attacked Kennedy as a stalking horse in social media posts last week.\n\nAnother result finds a potential risk for Trump in his current trial in New York on charges of falsifying business records to hide a payoff to a pornographic actress who says they had sex, which he denies. Eighty percent of Trump's supporters say they'd stick with him even if he's convicted of a felony in this case. But that leaves 20% who say they'd either reconsider their support (16%) or withdraw it (4%) -- easily enough to matter in a close race.\n\nSupport for Trump if convicted ABC News / IPSOS Poll\n\nThat said, a chief question raised by the survey is why Biden is competitive at all, given his substantial disadvantages. Just 35% of Americans approve of his job performance, with 57% disapproving; that's 2 points from his career low in approval in January and well below the level historically associated with reelection. Forty-three percent say they've gotten worse off financially under his presidency. An overwhelming 81% say he's too old for another term. Trump easily outpoints him in perceived mental sharpness and physical health.\n\nTrump, moreover, leads in trust to handle six of 10 issues tested in the survey, with Biden ahead in just two. That includes, for Trump, the three most-cited issues in importance -- the economy, on which he has a 14-point advantage; inflation, again 14 points; and crime and safety, 8 points. He tops out with a 17-point lead in trust to handle immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border and leads by 8 points in trust to handle the war between Israel and Hamas and 7 points on \"America's standing in the world.\" Biden's leads are on abortion access (+12, but comparatively low-rated as an issue) and health care, +5.\n\nElection issues: importance and trust ABC News / IPSOS Poll\n\nIt's also the case that Biden lacks traditional Democratic advantages among young adults and Hispanic people, and he's about 20 points weaker among Black people under age 50 than among those 50 and older. But he and Trump run essentially evenly, 42-40%, among independents, who are swing voters in most presidential elections; Biden leads by 11 points among moderates; and among those who have held steady financially -- not gaining ground but at least not losing it -- he's up by a broad 66-21%.\n\nFinancial situation and Biden approval ABC News / IPSOS Poll\n\nFactors\n\nOther factors help explain why, despite his weaknesses, Biden is in the game. He leads by 16 points on one important personal attribute, being seen as honest and trustworthy, and is about tied with Trump on two others -- representing your personal values (Biden +3) and understanding the problems of people like you (Biden +1). And while neither is popular, more people see Biden favorably as a person, 40%, than see Trump favorably, 33%.\n\nPersonal favorability ABC News / IPSOS Poll\n\nFurther, substantial numbers of Americans don't trust either candidate to handle the issues tested in the survey -- and among them, in most albeit not all cases, Biden leads. For instance, among the 14% who don't trust either to handle the economy (excluding nonvoters), Biden has 49% support, Trump 13%. (The rest mainly pick someone else.) In other examples, Biden leads by 45 points among those who don't trust either candidate on immigration and by 35 points among those who don't trust either on inflation.\n\nOn personal attributes, among those who don't think either candidate has the mental sharpness it takes to serve effectively -- about three in 10 adults -- Biden leads Trump by 63-15%. It's a similar result among those who don't think either has the physical health to serve. On the other hand, Trump leads by about as wide a margin among those who don't think either is honest and trustworthy.\n\nAdditionally, while eight in 10 see Biden as too old to serve another term, a smaller majority, 55%, says the same about Trump. And Biden wins 39% support even from those who say he's too old; Trump gets less support, 25%, among those who say this about him.\n\nPersonal attributes ABC News / IPSOS Poll\n\nNonetheless, results on \"double-haters\" are mixed. Among people who have unfavorable views of both candidates -- a more Republican group -- Trump leads Biden, 48 to 26%. But among those who disapprove of the work both have done during their presidencies -- a more Democratic group -- Biden leads with a similar margin, 48-21%.\n\nIn any case, it's certainly a match between unpopular figures. More people see Biden as a person unfavorably than favorably, 40-51%, favorable-unfavorable. But Trump's score, as noted, is worse, 33-58%. And 44% see Trump strongly unfavorably, 10 points more than say the same for Biden.\n\nTrump pushes back with a better retrospective job approval rating, 44-50%, approve-disapprove, than Biden has today. And among Trump's supporters, 55% back him strongly, vs. 44% strong support for Biden among his supporters.\n\nHistory\n\nFrom a historical perspective, Biden has a hill to climb, but not an impossible one. In data since the Truman administration, three presidents with underwater approval ratings in the spring before Election Day won a second term -- Barack Obama in 2012, George W. Bush in 2004 and Harry S. Truman in 1948. Obama and Bush both bottomed out in this period at 47%, Truman at 36%, compared with Biden's 35% today.\n\nOf course, historical precedents go only so far, as demonstrated by the 2022 midterms, when the Democrats fared much better than Biden's weak approval rating would have suggested.\n\nGroups\n\nFocusing on the two-way Biden-Trump race, results show the pull of partisanship and ideology. Eighty-eight percent of Democrats support Biden; 90% of Republicans are for Trump. (Nine percent of Democrats defect to Trump, while fewer Republicans, 5%, jump to Biden.) Independents, as mentioned, divide essentially evenly. In exit polls, the candidate who won independents has won the election in nine out of the last 12 presidential contests (all but in 2012, 2004 and 1976).\n\nAs reported Friday, liberals are more apt than others to say the United States is doing too much to support Israel and too little to help protect Palestinian civilians. Yet that doesn't appear to move many votes: 84% of liberals support Biden (vs. 8% for Trump). Across the spectrum, 82% of conservatives prefer Trump (vs. 10% for Biden). Biden leads among moderates, 50-39%, though that's weaker for him than in 2020.\n\nVoters age 18-29 divide 43-48%, Biden-Trump; the difference is not statistically significant given the sample size, and it's a far worse result for Biden than the typical Democratic advantage in this group. The same is true for Hispanic people, dividing 46-42%. And while Biden has 74% support from Black people, this, too, is off the usual Democratic lead in this group.\n\nFew Black people, 13%, back Trump; as many pick someone else. But there's a notable age gap: Black people age 50 and older support Biden over Trump by 85-5%. Among those younger than 50, it's 64-20%.\n\nThere's no significant gap between Black men and women. But there is a gender gap overall, with Trump up 9 points among men, Biden a non-significant 4 points among women. Among men aged 18-29, 54% back Trump, compared with 41% of women that age.\n\nBiden is +6 points among seniors -- also non-significant, but a group Trump won by single digits in 2020. In rural areas, a GOP stronghold, Biden picks up 35% from women, vs. 25% from men. At the same time, in urban areas, a Democratic bastion, Trump wins 40% of men, vs. 30% of women.\n\nThere's a big gap by education, with Biden +19 points among college graduates, Trump +15 among non-grads. Trump has 79% support among evangelical white Protestants, a GOP mainstay and a key source of his strength in the primaries. And it's a 46-45% race in the seven expected swing states, Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nLikely voters\n\nThe poll tests a few versions of likely voters, e.g., those who say they are registered to vote or will register and are certain to vote in November; and those who fit that definition and also say they voted in 2020, if old enough to have done so.\n\nTrump is +2 points among all adults (excluding nonvoters) while Biden is +4 among likely voters. While neither is a statistically significant difference, the reason for the Biden bump is that more educated people are more likely to vote, and, as noted, Biden leads Trump by 19 points among college graduates. Among all adults in the survey, 35% have a college degree. Among likely voters, it's 45%.\n\nOther issues\n\nThe poll checked in on other issues; among them:\n\nSupport for abortion rights remains widespread: Americans by 66-32% oppose the U.S. Supreme Court decision that did away with the constitutional right to abortion and by essentially the same margin say their own state should allow access to abortion in all or most cases.\n\n\n\nBiden's executive orders to forgive student loan debt get a mixed to negative reception: 42% say he's doing too much in this regard, 22% too little and 34% the right amount. Among those younger than 40, 30% say he's doing too much to forgive these loans; this jumps to 53% of those age 50 and older.\n\n\n\nThirty-nine percent call it highly important to them whom Biden picks as his running mate; 35% say the same for Trump. Overall, 54% say Biden should replace Kamala Harris as his choice for vice president; among Democrats, however, 76% say he should keep Harris. It's about the same among Biden supporters.\n\n\n\nEighty percent call undocumented immigration a problem nationally, including 54% who call it a major problem. Locally, in their own community, many fewer call it a problem, 46%, or a major problem, 22%. It's seen as a problem locally, and a major problem nationally, particularly by Republicans and conservatives.\n\n\n\nPassage of a $61 billion aid package for Ukraine did not substantially impact attitudes on the subject. Thirty-nine percent of Americans say the United States is doing too much to help Ukraine, up 5 points from January but about the same as it was last fall. Twenty percent say the United States is doing too little; 39%, the right amount -- both essentially unchanged.\n\nMethodology\n\nThis ABC News/Ipsos poll was conducted online via the probability-based Ipsos KnowledgePanel\u00ae April 25-30, 2024, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 2,260 adults. Partisan divisions are 31% Democrats, 29% Republicans and 28% independents. Results have a margin of sampling error of 2 percentage points, including the design effect, for the full sample. Sampling error is not the only source of differences in polls.\n\nThe survey was produced by Langer Research Associates, with sampling and data collection by Ipsos.

        "text": "Denial and uncertainty are looming over a Biden-Trump rematch 6 months out from Election Day\nWILMINGTON, N.C. (AP) \u2014 This North Carolina voter is nervous.\n\nWill Rikard, a 49-year-old father of two, was among several hundred Democrats who stood and cheered for Joe Biden as the first-term president delivered a fiery speech recently about the billions of dollars he has delivered to protect the state\u2019s drinking water.\n\nBut afterward, the Wilmington resident acknowledged he is worried about Biden\u2019s political standing in the looming rematch with former Republican President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not enough energy,\u201d Rikard said of Biden\u2019s coalition. \u201cI think people are gonna need to wake up and get going.\u201d\n\nExactly six months before Election Day, Biden and Trump are locked in the first contest in 112 years with a current and former president competing for the White House. It\u2019s a race that is at once deeply entrenched and highly in flux as many voters are only just beginning to embrace the reality of the 2024 campaign.\n\nWars, trials, the independent candidacy of Robert Kennedy Jr. and deep divisions across America have injected extraordinary uncertainty into a race for the White House in which either man would be the oldest president ever sworn in on Inauguration Day. At the same time, policy fights over abortion, immigration and the economy are raging on Capitol Hill and in statehouses.\n\nVOTERS IN DENIAL\n\nHovering over it all is the disbelief of many voters, despite all evidence to the contrary, that Biden and Trump \u2014 their respective parties\u2019 presumptive nominees \u2014 will ultimately appear on the general election ballot this fall.\n\n\u201cI think we have an electorate that\u2019s going through the stages of grief about this election,\u201d said Sarah Longwell, who conducts regular focus groups with voters across the political spectrum as co-founder of Republican Voters Against Trump. \u201cThey\u2019ve done denial \u2014 \u2018Not these two, can\u2019t possibly be these two.\u2019 And I think they\u2019re in depression now. I\u2019m waiting for people to hit acceptance.\u201d\n\nTrump is in the midst of the first of potentially four criminal trials and facing felony charges. The Constitution does not prevent him from assuming the presidency if convicted \u2014 or even if he is in prison.\n\nBiden, who will turn 82 years old just weeks after Election Day, Nov. 5, is already the oldest president in U.S. history; Trump is 77.\n\nPrivately, Democratic operatives close to the campaign worry constantly about Biden\u2019s health and voters\u2019 dim perceptions of it. In recent weeks, aides have begun walking at Biden\u2019s side as he strolls to and from Marine One, the presidential helicopter, on the White House South Lawn in an apparent effort to help mask the president\u2019s stiff gait.\n\nStill, neither party is making serious contingency plans. Whether voters want to believe it or not, the general election matchup is all but set.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, said many voters are recovering from what he called \u201ca knock-down, drag-out fight\u201d that was the 2020 presidential election.\n\n\u201cMany of them have not wrapped their heads around the fact that it is, in fact, going to be a rematch,\u201d Cooper said in an interview. \u201cWhen they do, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question that Joe Biden is going to win the day.\u201d\n\nGETTING TO 270 ELECTORAL VOTES \u2014 THE BATTLEGROUND STATES\n\nEven before voters begin paying close attention, the political map in the fight for the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency is already taking shape.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign is increasingly optimistic about North Carolina, a state he lost by just 1 percentage point in 2020. Overall, the Democratic president\u2019s reelection campaign has several hundred staff in more than 133 offices in the seven most critical states: Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin and North Carolina.\n\nTrump\u2019s team has barely begun to roll out swing-state infrastructure, although he campaigned in Wisconsin and Michigan over the past week, sending a clear signal that he wants to block Biden\u2019s path to reelection via the Democrats\u2019 Midwestern \u201cblue wall.\u201d\n\nTrump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita said Trump is making plans to invest new resources in at least two other Democratic-leaning states.\n\nAt a private donor retreat in Florida on Saturday, LaCivita discussed the campaign\u2019s plans to expand its electoral map into Virginia and Minnesota, based on the Trump team\u2019s growing optimism that both states are within reach.\n\n\u201cWe have a real opportunity to expand the map here,\u201d LaCivita told The Associated Press. \u201cThe Biden campaign has spent tens of millions of dollars on TV ads and in their \u2018vaunted ground game\u2019. And they have nothing to show for it.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign welcomed Trump\u2019s team to spend money in Democratic states. \u201cThe Biden campaign is going to relentlessly focus on the pathway to 270 electoral votes, and that\u2019s what our efforts represent,\u201d campaign communications director Michael Tyler said.\n\nBiden has been spending far more aggressively on election infrastructure and advertising heading into the six-month stretch toward Election Day.\n\nIn the eight weeks since Trump essentially clinched the Republican nomination, his campaign has spent virtually nothing on television advertising, according to the media tracking firm AdImpact. Outside groups aligned with Trump have spent just over $9 million.\n\nOver the same period, AdImpact found, Biden and his allies have spent more than $29 million spread across Michigan, Arizona, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nTrump\u2019s team has been unusually conservative, in part, to avoid the perceived mistakes of 2020, when his campaign essentially ran out of money and was forced to cut back on advertising in the election\u2019s critical final days, but also because it has struggled to reignite its appeal with small donors and because of the diversion of some dollars to the former president\u2019s legal defense.\n\nTrump\u2019s team insists it will soon ramp up its advertising and on-the-ground infrastructure, although LaCivita refused to offer any specifics.\n\nVOTERS UNDERWHELMED WITH THEIR OPTIONS\n\nIt is clear that Biden and Trump have serious work to do to improve their standing with voters.\n\nWhile optimistic in public, Biden allies privately acknowledge that his approval ratings may be lower than Democrat Jimmy Carter\u2019s numbers at this point in his presidency. Trump\u2019s ratings are not much better.\n\nPublic polling consistently shows that voters don\u2019t like their 2024 options.\n\nOnly about 2 in 10 Americans say they would be excited by Biden (21%) or Trump (25%) being elected president, according to an AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted in March. Only about one-quarter of voters in the survey say they would be satisfied about each.\n\nA CNN poll conducted in April found that 53% of registered voters say they are dissatisfied with the presidential candidates they have to choose from in this year\u2019s election.\n\nAnother major wild card is Kennedy, a member of the storied political dynasty and an anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist who is running as an independent. Both major campaigns are taking him seriously as a potential spoiler, with Trump\u2019s allies notably ramping up their criticism of Kennedy in recent days.\n\nBIDEN\u2019S PLAN: REMIND VOTERS WHAT TRUMP\u2019S PRESIDENCY WAS LIKE\n\nFor now, Biden\u2019s team is most focused on reminding voters of Trump\u2019s divisive leadership. Three years after Trump left office, there is a sense that some voters may have forgotten what it was like with the former reality television star in the Oval Office \u2014 or his efforts to overturn the 2020 election that have landed him in legal peril.\n\n\u201cThe plan is reminding voters of what life was like with Trump and also demonstrating to voters that the ways in which the world feels uncertain to them now are not, in fact, caused by the president, but can actually be navigated by this president,\u201d Biden pollster Molly Murphy told the AP. \u201cVoters will trust his leadership and stewardship, knowing that things can be a lot worse if it\u2019s Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s team is also betting that fierce backlash to new restrictions on abortion, which Trump and Republicans have largely championed, will drive voters to Democrats like it did in the 2022 midterm election and 2023 state races.\n\nBut Biden\u2019s success also is dependent on the Democrat\u2019s ability to reassemble his winning coalition from 2020 at a time when enthusiasm is lagging among critical voting blocs, including Blacks, young voters and Arab Americans unhappy over the president\u2019s handling of the war in Gaza.\n\nTRUMP\u2019S PLAN: TURN HIS LEGAL WOES TO HIS ADVANTAGE\n\nTrump has been forced to adapt his campaign to his first criminal trial in New York. Prosecutors allege he committed financial fraud to hide hush money payments to a porn actor, Stormy Daniels, who says she had a sexual encounter with Trump. He denies her claim and has pleaded not guilty.\n\nFor now, Trump is forced to attend the trial most weekdays. A verdict is likely still weeks away. And after that, he faces the prospect of more trials related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his handling of classified documents. The Supreme Court is weighing whether Trump should be granted immunity, or partial immunity, for the actions he took while in office.\n\nTrump over the past week wedged in campaign stops around his court schedule, rallying voters in Wisconsin and Michigan, where the abortion debate is raging.\n\nTrump seemed to be searching for a way to lessen the political sting from the upheaval over the Supreme Court\u2019s overturning of national abortion rights. The former president suggested the issue will ultimately bring the country together as states carve out differing laws.\n\n\u201cA lot of bad things will happen beyond the abortion issue if you don\u2019t win elections, with your taxes and everything else,\u201d he told Michigan voters.\n\nTrump\u2019s camp privately maintains that his unprecedented trial in New York will dominate the news \u2014 and voters\u2019 attention \u2014 for the foreseeable future. His campaign has largely stopped trying to roll out unrelated news during the trial.\n\nEven if Trump were to be convicted by the New York jury, his advisers insist the fundamentals of the election will not change. Trump has worked aggressively to undermine public confidence in the charges against him. Meanwhile, more traditional issues work in his favor, including stubbornly high inflation and the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border, in the view of the Trump team.\n\nLaCivita said that such issues constantly reinforce Biden\u2019s weakness as \u201cthe news of the day keeps getting worse.\u201d\n\nBoth sides seem to agree that the dynamics of the race may yet shift dramatically based on any number of factors, from how the economy fares or the course of the wars in Gaza and Ukraine to crime or migration trends or other foreseen events. Potential candidate debates this fall could be another wild card.\n\nSuch uncertainty, said Biden\u2019s battleground states director Dan Kanninen, can play to their favor.\n\n\u201cThat dynamic is an opportunity as much as a challenge for us,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause we will have the resources, the infrastructure and the operation built to be engaging voters throughout all those difficult waters.\u201d\n\n___\n\nThis story was first published on May 5, 2024. It was published again on May 6, 2024, to correct the name of the Biden pollster to Molly Murphy, not Mary Murphy.\n\n____\n\nMiller reported from Washington.

        "text": "An expensive, personal, very close presidential race careens toward an uncertain end\nSix months from Election Day, American voters are confronting a presidential race that looks stable at a glance \u2014 and is roiling with uncertainty beneath the surface.\n\nFor the first time in more than a century, Americans will choose between two presumptive major-party nominees who have already served as commander-in-chief: President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump.\n\nBut while the matchup has long been expected, Americans are sour about it: Election interest hit a 20-year low in the latest NBC News poll, and majorities of registered voters have unfavorable views of both men. That means barring a big change, the election will be decided by voters with negative views of both Biden and Trump \u2014 not only who they pick but whether they decide to participate at all in what\u2019s expected to be the most expensive presidential race in American history.\n\nTrump holds a narrow 2-point lead among registered voters, inside the margin of error, in NBC News\u2019 April poll, in an election where both candidates appear to have a different theory of the case. Biden is leaning hard on issues like abortion rights, where polls show he has the upper hand, while utilizing a significant fundraising advantage.\n\nBut polls also show a majority of Americans disapprove of Biden\u2019s job in office \u2014 an opening Trump has seized to hammer Biden on issues like the economy and the border, all while looking to energize his base as he faces dozens of federal and state charges across four different cases. Meanwhile, third-party candidates are seeking to capitalize on apathy toward the major candidates.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at where the 2024 presidential race stands six months out \u2014 in the polls, on the balance sheet, in key battlegrounds and more.\n\nTrump\u2019s narrow edge over Biden\n\nDespite a turbulent and chaotic news environment, the contest between Biden and Trump remains both close and stable with six months to go until Election Day, according to most polls.\n\nNBC News\u2019 latest national survey shows Trump ahead by 2 points among registered voters, 46%-44% \u2014 well within the poll\u2019s margin of error.\n\nWhat also stands out is how the race has barely budged over the year, with Trump\u2019s share stuck between 45% and 47%. Biden\u2019s has fluctuated more, but only a little more, between a high of 49% and a low of 42%.\n\nOther polls \u2014 both nationally and in the key battleground states \u2014 confirm how competitive and stable the race has been.\n\nBiden\u2019s biggest advantages are among Black voters, women and white voters with college degrees. Trump, meanwhile, has the edge among men, white voters and white voters without college degrees.\n\nThe NBC News poll shows Biden and Trump tied or competitive among independents, Latinos and young voters \u2014 though the polls have differed on whether young voters have actually defected from Biden.\n\nBut the polling also points to potential wild cards that could upend this stability. These include third-party candidates being introduced to the mix: NBC News\u2019 latest poll finds a 2-point lead for Trump turning into a 2-point Biden edge when the ballot is expanded, though other surveys have shown Trump doing better when third-party options are included.\n\nMeanwhile, a quarter of voters say they could change their minds. Ultimately, the fluid battle for votes from people considering third-party candidates could change dramatically between now and Election Day, as Biden and Trump hammer their other competitors \u2014 and each other.\n\nHow things can change in the last six months\n\nWhen incumbents have run for re-election, there\u2019s been relatively little movement in NBC News national polling between six months out and Election Day.\n\nBut that finding comes with a few huge caveats. The Electoral College (not the popular vote) decides who wins the presidency. A shift of just a few percentage points, particularly in key swing states, could matter a lot in a close election. And the 2016 election shifted substantially with Trump on the ballot.\n\nIn April 2020, Biden led Trump by 7 percentage points in the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, 49%-42%. Biden\u2019s final popular vote margin over Trump in November was 4 percentage points.\n\nIn 2012, President Barack Obama led Republican Mitt Romney by 6 percentage points in the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll and won the popular vote later that fall by 3 points.\n\nAnd in 2004, President George W. Bush\u2019s 3-point lead in the May 2004 NBC News poll mirrored the popular vote victory he scored months later.\n\nBut that relative stability was not present in 2016, when Democrat Hillary Clinton led Trump by 11 points in NBC\u2019s April 2016 poll, long before key flashpoints including the FBI\u2019s investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of her private email server and the release of the Trump \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape. Clinton won the popular vote by just 2 percentage points, but she obviously lost the Electoral College, and with it the presidency.\n\nWhat voters are weighing most\n\nVoters have routinely cited several major concerns as they decide their votes \u2014 things like the economy and inflation, Biden\u2019s age and the state of abortion rights across the country.\n\nThe latest NBC News national poll presented voters with a battery of these oft-cited issues and qualities, asking respondents to identify which candidate would best tackle each issue.\n\nBiden won out on just two qualities. On who has the ability to bring the country together, 37% of voters said he would do a better job, while 28% said Trump would do better. And on dealing with the issue of abortion, 46% said Biden would do a better job compared to 31% about Trump.\n\nTrump bested Biden on one issue routinely ranked high by voters as a top issue this election year: dealing with inflation and the cost of living. Over half \u2014 52% \u2014 of those surveyed said Trump would handle this issue better and just 30% said the same about Biden.\n\nTrump also led Biden on several qualities like being competent and effective and having a strong record of accomplishments as president.\n\nOn the ground in the battlegrounds\n\nThe realities of the Electoral College system mean much of the next six months of campaign activity and spending will focus on a handful of closely contested battleground states. So far, Trump has slightly edged out Biden in events in the most competitive states, in part because he lives in battleground Florida. Without Florida, it\u2019s Biden who has held more battleground events.\n\nIn 2020, eight states were decided by 5 percentage points or less. Biden won Georgia, Arizona and Wisconsin by razor-thin margins \u2014 carrying each state by less than 1 point. Biden\u2019s narrow wins in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Nevada also fueled his victory, while Trump carried North Carolina by 1 point and Florida by 3 points.\n\nBoth Biden and Trump are traveling to the key battlegrounds, although Trump has not yet held a campaign event in Arizona. While Biden has held fewer events just with his campaign, he has made several visits to these states for official White House events, underscoring how incumbent presidents can leverage their office in an election year.\n\nThe battlegrounds getting the most attention from Biden so far include North Carolina, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, with six events in each state. Trump has appeared at far more events in Florida than any other battleground, including some events at his Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, where Trump also lives. Next after that: Pennsylvania and Nevada.\n\nFewer voters than usual are enthusiastic about the election\n\nVoters are not exactly excited about the 2024 race, especially compared to past elections. The most recent NBC News national poll found the lowest level of interest at this point in the election cycle since 2012, with 64% of registered voters rating their interest either a \u201c9\u201d or a \u201c10\u201d on a 10-point enthusiasm scale.\n\nThat\u2019s a sizable drop from the 74% who said they had a high interest in the election in April 2020. Interest has been stagnant for months, but past elections have seen an uptick in enthusiasm closer to November. In March 2012, 67% of voters in an NBC News poll said they had a high interest in the election, and that increased to 77% by October of that year.\n\nA big cash gap\n\nIt\u2019s clear Biden and the Democrats have a significant fundraising edge over Trump and Republicans with six months to go.\n\nOver the first three months of 2024, the Biden campaign had raised more, spent more and ended March with more money in the bank than the Trump campaign. Through March, the most recent month for which campaigns have filed campaign finance reports, the Biden campaign had more than $85.5 million banked away, while Trump\u2019s campaign had $45.1 million.\n\nThe national party organizations are in a similar place: The Democratic National Committee outraised and outspent the Republican National Committee in each of January, February and March, closing the first quarter with $45.2 million in cash on hand to the RNC\u2019s $21.6 million. Overall, the Biden and the DNC had almost twice the cash on hand as the Republicans and Trump.\n\nBut the GOP is hopeful it can make a dent into that lead now that Trump is firmly in control of the party, having captured the delegates for the nomination in March. Sources told NBC News last month that an early-April fundraiser in Florida had more than $50 million in commitments (those numbers aren\u2019t able to be confirmed until fundraising reports are filed later this month). More big Republican donors are coming back into the fold and supporting Trump as the party continues to fall behind its presumptive nominee. And after installing new leadership at the RNC, Trump is headlining the party\u2019s spring retreat, which will take place in part at his Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida.\n\nOn the airwaves\n\nMore than $400 million has already been spent on ads in the presidential race, including the millions spent during the contested GOP primary, according to the ad tracking firm AdImpact.\n\nTrump\u2019s allied super PAC, MAGA Inc., has been one of the top-spending groups through Sunday, largely focusing the $45.6 million spent so far on securing the Republican nomination for Trump. But Biden\u2019s campaign has already eclipsed Trump on the airwaves, spending more than twice as much on ads through Sunday.\n\nBiden has had a huge advantage over Trump on the airwaves since former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley ended her run for the GOP nomination in early March. Since Haley dropped out of the race and kicked off the general election, Biden\u2019s campaign has spent $24.5 million on ads, while Trump\u2019s campaign has spent just $50,000.\n\nBiden\u2019s allied super PAC is also the only group that has reserved airtime from Monday through Election Day in November. So far, the Future Forward PAC has spent $130 million on ad reservations through Nov. 5, while MAGA Inc. has spent $728,000 on future reservations.\n\nAdImpact has projected that the 2024 race will be the costliest yet, estimating that $10.2 billion will be spent on ads, surpassing 2020\u2019s record by more than $1 billion.\n\nTrump on trial\n\nTrump\u2019s legal troubles add an especially unpredictable and unusual piece to the 2024 election.\n\nTrump has already been through 11 days of trial in New York, where he\u2019s accused of falsifying business records related to an alleged hush money payment to an adult film star. And that trial is expected to run for weeks before the jury is asked to render a verdict.\n\nHe could still face one or two more trials before the year is over on more serious charges, trials that could keep him off the campaign trail for extended periods and, more importantly, shift the contours of this race. But no dates have been set.\n\nThe pending federal case in Washington, D.C., in which he is accused of election interference, is on hold pending a Supreme Court decision that isn\u2019t expected until the end of June.\n\nNeither the Florida case, which considers whether Trump mishandled classified documents, nor the Georgia case, in which he is accused of racketeering in his bid to overturn the 2020 election, has a start date, but they could theoretically begin in the next six months.",

Tim Scott of South Carolina on Sunday did not directly answer multiple questions about whether he'd accept the results of the 2024 presidential election, regardless of who wins.\n\n\"At the end of the day, the 47th president of the United States will be President Donald Trump,\" Scott, a Republican, said the first time he was directly asked whether he would commit to accepting the election results on NBC News' \"Meet the Press.\"\n\nAsked again by moderator Kristen Welker to answer \"yes or no?\" to the original question, Scott simply said, \"That is my statement.\"\n\nPressed a third time to answer the question, Scott said, \"I look forward to President Trump being the 47th president \u2014 the American people will make the decision.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Trump himself told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that he would accept the results of the presidential election in Wisconsin only \"if everything\u2019s honest.\"\n\n\u201cIf everything\u2019s honest, I\u2019d gladly accept the results,\" he said, adding, \u201cIf it\u2019s not, you have to fight for the right of the country.\"\n\nScott ran for president last year, challenging Trump for the Republican nomination. He dropped out in November and eventually endorsed the former president.\n\nNow, he's widely considered to be on the shortlist for Trump's vice presidential pick.\n\nBut following the 2020 presidential election, when Trump questioned the integrity of the election and baselessly alleged that voter fraud took place in states across the country, Scott offered a different tone.\n\nAhead of the Jan. 6, 2021, congressional session to certify the presidential election results, Scott said in a statement, \"The President\u2019s legal team exercised its right to access the courts by initiating suits in state and federal courts in numerous states. Some of these lawsuits have even been presided over and adjudicated by conservative judges nominated by President Trump. Thus far, no justice, judge or fact finder has found evidence indicating the election results in those states should be overturned.\"\n\nHe added that \u201cas I read the Constitution, there is no constitutionally viable means for the Congress to overturn an election wherein the states have certified and sent their Electors\" and later voted to certify the results of the presidential election.\n\nEven later on the campaign trail, Scott disagreed with voters who claimed the 2020 election was stolen.\n\n\"I do not believe the election was stolen. I do believe that states created a new system, mail-in ballots, that did not have signature verification,\" Scott said during a campaign event in June in Davenport, Iowa.\n\nAfter an audience member asked questions about \"cheating\" in the election, Scott added, \"There was cheating, but was the election stolen? There\u2019s a difference. I think every election there\u2019s cheating.\"",

Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee, continues to sow doubts about the last presidential election and is warning his followers that Democrats will try to cheat .",
        "text": "Group of Republicans unite to defend legitimacy of US elections\nIt was Election Day last November, and one of Georgia\u2019s top election officials saw that reports of a voting machine problem in an eastern Pennsylvania county were gaining traction online.\n\nSo Gabriel Sterling, a Republican who had defended the 2020 election in Georgia amid an onslaught of threats, posted a message to his nearly 71,000 followers on the social platform X explaining what had happened and saying that all votes would be counted correctly.\n\nHe faced immediate criticism from one commenter about why he was weighing in on another state\u2019s election while other responses reiterated false claims about widespread fraud in the 2020 presidential election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still the right thing to do,\u201d Sterling told a gathering the following day, stressing the importance of Republican officials speaking up to defend elections. \u201cWe have to be prepared to say over and over again \u2014 other states are doing it different than us, but they are not cheating.\u201d\n\nSterling, the chief operating officer for the Georgia Secretary of State\u2019s Office, is part of an effort begun after the last presidential election that seeks to bring together Republican officials who are willing to defend the country's election systems and the people who run them. They want officials to reinforce the message that elections are secure and accurate, an approach they say is especially important as the country heads toward another divisive presidential contest.\n\nThe group has held meetings in several states, with more planned before the November 5 election.\n\nWith six months to go before the likely rematch between Democratic President Joe Biden and former Republican President Donald Trump, concerns are running high among election officials that public distrust of voting and ballot counting persists, particularly among Republicans. Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee, continues to sow doubts about the last presidential election and is warning his followers \u2014 without citing any evidence \u2014 that Democrats will try to cheat in the upcoming one.\n\nThis past week, during a campaign rally in Michigan, Trump repeated his false claim that Democrats rigged the 2020 election. \u201cBut we\u2019re not going to allow them to rig the presidential election,\u201d he said.\n\nJust 22% of Republicans expressed high confidence that votes will be counted accurately in November, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll last year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an obligation on Republicans' part to stand up for the defense of our system because our party \u2014 there\u2019s some blame for where we stand right now,\u201d said Kentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams, who is part of the group and won reelection last year.\n\nThe effort, which began about 18 months ago, is coordinated by the SNF Agora Institute at Johns Hopkins University and the center-right think tank R Street Institute. The goal has been to start conversations about trust in elections, primarily among conservative officials, and to develop a set of principles to accomplish that.\n\n\u201cThis has never been and will never be about Trump specifically,\u201d said Matt Germer, director of governance for the R Street Institute and a lead organizer of the effort. \u201cIt\u2019s about democratic principles at a higher level \u2014 what does it mean to be a conservative who believes in democracy, the rule of law?\"\n\nHe said an aim is to have a structure in place to support election officials who might find themselves in situations like that of Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in 2020, when he supported Trump but rejected false claims that the election was stolen. Prosecutors in Georgia have since charged Trump and others, alleging a plot to overturn the results. Trump has pleaded not guilty.\n\n\u201cYou can be a Republican and you can believe in all the Republican ideas without having to say the election was stolen,\u201d Germer said.\n\nA guiding principle for the group is that Republican officials should \u201cpublicly affirm the security and integrity of elections across the U.S. and avoid actively fueling doubt about elections in other jurisdictions.\u201d\n\nKim Wyman, a Republican who previously served as Washington state\u2019s top election official, said it\u2019s imperative when officials are confronted with questions about an election somewhere else that they don\u2019t avoid the question by promoting election procedures in their own state.\n\nIt's OK to say you don\u2019t know the various laws and procedures in another state, Wyman said, but she urged fellow Republicans to emphasize what states do have in common \u2014 \"the security measures, the control measures to make sure the election is being conducted with integrity.\u201d\n\nKansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab, a Republican who has participated in meetings organized by the group, said he believes there are certain aspects of elections that officials should feel comfortable talking about. But he said he would remain cautious of speaking directly about something specific happening in another state.\n\n\u201cIf I start going beyond my realm and my role, then they don\u2019t trust me. And if they don\u2019t trust me, then they don\u2019t trust the elections in Kansas, and that\u2019s pretty important,\u201d Schwab said in an interview.",

        "text": "Chad's presidential elections underway in peace, but with tension\nChad\u2019s presidential election concludes Monday with civilians going to the polls, a day after members of the military cast their ballots. Transitional President General Mahamat Idriss Deby is facing nine challengers, including his current prime minister. The election, designed to end three years of a military government, has been peaceful so far. However, there is tension over a ban on taking pictures of election result sheets at polling stations.\n\nHundreds of people started arriving at polling stations in Chad's capital N'djamena as early as 5:30 am local time.\n\nAmong the voters at the University of N'djamena was 29-year-old student Abdel Koura. He says he came out early to vote because he wants a president that will bring peace and provide jobs for youths who are unemployed after completing their education.\n\nKoura says voting is his civic right. He says he is calling on all civilians, especially youths, to come out in huge numbers and vote for their leader in peace. He says he is also pleading with Chad's transitional government to avoid chaos by ensuring that the elections are transparent and free and the winner would be who civilians have voted for.\n\nEarly voting was peaceful. However, Chad\u2019s National Election Management Agency, known as ANGE, said that several thousand polling stations opened late due to what they call logistical difficulties.\n\nChad's transitional president General Mahamat Idriss Deby voted in N'djamena\u2019s second district and pleaded with civilians to go out en masse and perform their civic duty of voting for the person who will manage Chad's affairs for the next five years.\n\nANGE says 8.2 million people are registered to vote. It says Chad's military has been deployed to protect voters\u2019 safety in over 26,500 polling stations.\n\nChad says over 2,500 national and international observers from 120 groups are accredited to monitor the elections. It says applications from another 60 groups were rejected for not respecting the country\u2019s laws.\n\nCyrille Nguiegang Ntchassep is the spokesperson for observers from the six-nation Central African Economic and Monetary Commission. He has concerns that peace will not hold.\n\nHe says perceivable tensions over a ban on filming or taking photos of result sheets in polling stations and publishing them on social media and radio and television are likely to degenerate into violent clashes because civilians think that the central African state\u2019s elections management body is controlled by Deby who created it. Ntchassep says he does not understand why Chad is reluctant to proclaim election results in a day or two as was the case in Senegal's March 24 presidential polls.\n\nOpposition and civil society groups, including the Transformers Party of Deby\u2019s main challenger Succces Masra, said they planned to photograph the election result sheets and distribute them to the international community. They say the move is to prevent ANGE from rigging the elections in favor of Deby.\n\nTahir Oloy Hassan is ANGE\u2019s spokesperson. Hassan says ANGE is a permanent, independent and impartial body that does not receive orders from any state authority including Deby.\n\nHe says the ban on filming and taking photos of result sheets and prohibition of media organs from having access to some polling stations and sensitive areas is to reduce tensions that may arise from misinformation and manipulation by people who want to see Chad in chaos.\n\nHe said claims by opposition candidates that Chad's military was instructed to vote for Deby when they went to the polls on Sunday are unfounded.\n\nANGE says it has up to May 21 to publish provisional results and only Chad's Constitutional Council has the powers to proclaim definitive results.\n\nThe elections are design to end three years of transition that followed the death of Idriss Deby Itno in 2021.\n\nChad's opposition and civil society says the younger Deby's rule was marked by political tensions including October 2022 pro-democracy protests during which the central African state's security forces killed at least 50 people, injured 300 and arrested several hundred others.",

        "text": "Though noncitizens can vote in few local elections, GOP goes big to make it illegal \u2022 Stateline\nPreventing people who are not United States citizens from casting a ballot has reemerged as a focal point in the ongoing Republican drive to safeguard \u201celection integrity,\u201d even though noncitizens are rarely involved in voter fraud.\n\nAhead of November\u2019s presidential election, congressional and state Republican lawmakers are aiming to keep noncitizens away from the polls. They\u2019re using state constitutional amendments and new laws that require citizenship verification to vote. Noncitizens can vote in a handful of local elections in several states, but already are not allowed to vote in statewide or federal elections.\n\nSome Republicans argue that preventing noncitizens from casting ballots \u2014 long a boogeyman in conservative politics \u2014 reduces the risk of fraud and increases confidence in American democracy. But even some on the right think these efforts are going too far, as they churn up anti-immigration sentiment and unsupported fears of widespread fraud, all to boost turnout among the GOP base.\n\nWhile Republican congressional leaders want to require documentation proving U.S. citizenship when registering to vote in federal elections, voters in at least four states will decide on ballot measures in November that would amend their state constitutions to clarify that only U.S. citizens can vote in state and local elections.\n\nOver the past six years, Alabama, Colorado, Florida, Louisiana, North Dakota and Ohio have all amended their state constitutions.\n\nIn Kentucky \u2014 which along with Idaho, Iowa and Wisconsin is now considering a constitutional amendment \u2014 noncitizens voting will not be tolerated, said Republican state Sen. Damon Thayer, who voted in February to put the amendment on November\u2019s ballot. Five Democrats between the two chambers backed the Republican-authored legislation, while 16 others dissented.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of concern here about the Biden administration\u2019s open border policies,\u201d Thayer, the majority floor leader, told Stateline. \u201cPeople see it on the news every day, with groups of illegals pouring through the border. And they\u2019re combined with concerns on election integrity.\u201d\n\nU.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson expressed similar concerns last month when he announced new legislation \u2014 despite an existing 1996 ban \u2014 that would make it illegal for noncitizens to vote in federal elections. During a trip to Florida to meet with former President Donald Trump, the Louisiana Republican said it\u2019s common sense to require proof of citizenship.\n\n\u201cIt could, if there are enough votes, affect the presidential election,\u201d he said, standing in front of Trump in the presumptive presidential nominee\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort. \u201cWe cannot wait for widespread fraud to occur, especially when the threat of fraud is growing with every single illegal immigrant that crosses that border.\u201d\n\nThat rhetoric is rooted in a fear about how the U.S. is changing demographically, becoming more diverse as the non-white population increases, said longtime Republican strategist Mike Madrid. Though this political strategy has worked to galvanize support among GOP voters in the past, he questions whether this will be effective politically in the long term.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no problem being solved here,\u201d said Madrid, whose forthcoming book, \u201cThe Latino Century,\u201d outlines the group\u2019s growing voter participation. \u201cThis is all politics. It\u2019s all about stoking fears and angering the base.\u201d\n\nNoncitizens are voting in some elections around the country, but not in a way that many might think.\n\nWhere noncitizens vote\n\nIn 16 cities and towns in California, Maryland and Vermont (along with the District of Columbia), noncitizens are allowed to vote in some local elections, such as for school board or city council. Voters in Santa Ana, California, will decide in November whether to allow noncitizens to vote in citywide elections.\n\nIn 2022, New York\u2019s State Supreme Court struck down New York City\u2019s 2021 ordinance that allowed noncitizens to vote in local elections, ruling it violated the state constitution. Proponents have argued that people, regardless of citizenship status, should be able to vote on local issues affecting their children and community.\n\nDuring the first 150 years of the U.S., 40 states at various times permitted noncitizens to vote in elections. That came to a halt in the 1920s when nativism ramped up and states began making voting a privilege for only U.S. citizens.\n\nThe number of noncitizen voters has been relatively small, and those voters are never allowed to participate in statewide or national elections. Local election officials maintain separate voter lists to keep noncitizens out of statewide databases.\n\nIn Vermont\u2019s local elections in March, 62 noncitizens voted in Burlington, 13 voted in Montpelier and 11 voted in Winooski, all accounting for a fraction of the total votes.\n\nIn Takoma Park, Maryland, of the 347 noncitizens who were registered to vote in 2017, just 72 cast a ballot, according to the latest data provided by the city. And in San Francisco, 36 noncitizens registered to vote in 2020 and 31 voted.\n\nThis is all politics. It\u2019s all about stoking fears and angering the base. \u2013 Mike Madrid, Republican strategist and author\n\nVoter turnout among noncitizens is low for two reasons, said Ron Hayduk, a professor of political science at San Francisco State University, who is one of the leading scholars in this area. Many noncitizens in these jurisdictions do not realize they have the right to vote, and many are afraid of deportation or legal issues, he said.\n\nRegistration forms in jurisdictions that allow noncitizens to vote in local elections do acknowledge the risks. In San Francisco, local election officials warn that the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement or other agencies could gain access to the city\u2019s registration lists and advise residents to consult an immigration attorney before registering to vote.\n\n\u201cImmigrants were very excited about this new right to vote, they wanted to vote, but many of them did not ultimately register and vote because they were concerned,\u201d Hayduk said.\n\nWhile there are some noncitizens participating in a handful of local elections, they\u2019re not participating illegally in any substantial way in state and national elections.\n\nThough there\u2019s room for legitimate debate about whether noncitizens should be allowed to vote at the local level, there is no widespread voter fraud among noncitizens nationally, said Walter Olson, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.\n\nIn 2020, federal investigators charged 19 noncitizens for voting in North Carolina elections. A national database run by The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, shows that there have been fewer than 100 cases of voter fraud tied to noncitizens since 2002, according to a recent count by The Washington Post.\n\nTrump continues to falsely assert that he was the rightful winner of the 2020 presidential election and that he had more of the popular vote in 2016. He has claimed without evidence that voter fraud was to blame, including in part from noncitizens.\n\nWith illegal immigration near the top of major issues for voters ahead of November, Trump and his movement sense they have momentum with the public to tie immigration concerns with their continued election claims, Olson said.\n\nIt\u2019s a way of keeping Democrats on the back foot, by falsely accusing them of allowing immigrants to come into the country illegally so they can vote, he added.\n\n\u201cThe imaginings that there is some sort of plot by an entire major political party is just remarkably evidence-free,\u201d he said.\n\nFighting \u2018the left\u2019\n\nAlthough voter fraud among noncitizens is not happening widely, states should still add protections to their voting systems to prevent that possibility, said Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican.\n\nRaffensperger has been a major proponent of a Peach State law that requires documentation to verify the citizenship status of voters. In 2022, he announced that an internal audit of Georgia\u2019s voter rolls over the past 25 years found that 1,634 noncitizens had attempted to register to vote, but not a single one cast a ballot.\n\n\u201cI will continue to fight the left on this issue so that only American citizens decide American elections,\u201d Raffensperger wrote in a statement to Stateline.\n\nMeanwhile, lawmakers in Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina and West Virginia are actively considering legislation that would add ballot initiatives for November to prevent noncitizen voting. Those bills are at various points in the legislative process, with many having already passed one chamber.\n\nDuring a committee hearing last week, Republican Missouri state Sen. Ben Brown said the state\u2019s constitutional language is vague enough to allow cities to let noncitizens vote. While presenting his bill, he cited California\u2019s parallel constitutional wording and how cities such as Oakland and San Francisco allow noncitizens to vote in local elections.\n\nMost state constitutions have similar language around voter eligibility, saying that \u201cevery\u201d U.S. citizen that is 18 or over can vote. The proposed amendments usually would change one word, emphasizing that \u201conly\u201d U.S. citizens can vote, eliminating an ambiguity in the text that has left room for cities in several states to allow noncitizen participation in elections.\n\nIt\u2019s a \u201cpretty simple\u201d fix, said Jack Tomczak, vice president of outreach for Americans for Citizen Voting, a group that works with state lawmakers to amend their constitutions so that only citizens can vote in state and local elections.\n\n\u201cIt does dilute the voice of citizens of this country,\u201d Tomczak said. \u201cAnd it also dilutes the nature of citizenship.\u201d",

        "text": "Ways to Get Young People Involved in Elections\nAmerica\u2019s youth are our future leaders and changemakers; they\u2019re also our future voters.\n\nThat\u2019s why teaching civics to kids is an important part of their education. It builds their understanding of how our society works and creates community-minded citizens. It may also increase their political participation when they turn 18, ensuring a strong base of young voters in our nation.\n\nAs advocates for kids and teens, Boys & Girls Clubs of America champions policies and solutions that directly impact youth. Our national organization meets with officials on the Hill, working across party lines to ensure elected officials prioritize youth.\n\nWe also empower young people to speak up for what they value. At Boys & Girls Clubs, youth explore volunteering and community engagement, as well as advocacy for issues they care about. They learn to work with people of diverse backgrounds toward a common goal. In fact, according to the Youth Right Now survey:\n\nNine in 10 Club teens say they can express their ideas and thoughts clearly.\n\n81% of all Club kids, ages 9-18, believe they can make a difference in their community.\n\nWhen making a decision, 85% of Club youth think about how other people will be affected.\n\nThe election season offers many chances for all kids and teens to learn about voting rights and the difference that one person can make in the American democracy.\n\nWhat is the definition of civics?\n\nCivics are our rights and duties as citizens of a nation. A civics education can help youth understand how our community, state and country function.\n\nCivics teaches youth how their community operates, how decisions happen, how leaders are elected, and most importantly, how to get involved. Younger kids can see examples in how decisions are made at school or improvements around their community. Teens can explore issues they value and take part in community efforts and local advocacy.\n\nUnderstanding civics is especially important for kids today. The world is changing fast and becoming increasingly digital, and it\u2019s up to the next generation to be informed and involved citizens. Kids of all ages can learn how to have their voices heard, stand up for their beliefs and improve their communities.\n\nHow to talk about politics with kids\n\nWhat is the difference between civics and politics? While civics is how we participate in society to solve community problems, politics are the activities associated with government.\n\nEvery generation remembers time periods when politics, presidents and national events made a mark on their childhood. But for today\u2019s kids, 24/7 access to screens and social media means politics are ever-present and accessible in a way no previous generation has experienced. This means kids may already be hearing about social issues and politics, without a frame of understanding.\n\nDiscussing politics with kids is an opportunity to encourage their critical thinking, tolerance for diverse ideas and exploration of their personal values. It also helps young people develop skills for civil discourse \u2014 the ability to have productive and respectful conversations with others, especially those of differing beliefs.\n\nHere are some tips for talking politics with young people:\n\nAsk what they\u2019ve heard about a topic and how it makes them feel.\n\nUsing age-appropriate wording, explain issues factually. Share the complex sides of an issue.\n\nDiscuss the importance of checking a variety of sources for information, just as students do when researching a paper. This is especially important in the 24/7 media cycle.\n\nStay neutral in your descriptions, avoiding words that imply a right side versus a wrong. Give space for your young person to form their opinion.\n\nShare how not everyone believes or values the same things. In our democracy, everyone gets a vote to be part of decision making.\n\nIdeas for engaging young people in politics, elections and civics:\n\nOne of the best ways for kids to learn about civics is by getting involved. Read on for activity ideas for all ages.\n\nIdeas for Teens to Engage in Politics (Ages 13-18)\n\nFind Ways to Improve Your Community\n\nHelp your teen brainstorm or research local community service projects related to their values. If your teen wants to make a difference on climate change, they can organize a roadside litter cleanup or recycling event. Reading books to younger children is one way to get involved if education policy matters to your teen.\n\nWrite a Letter to Your Representative\n\nTeens can have their voice heard by writing a letter to or contacting their elected officials. They can write to their representative about priorities that matter to today\u2019s youth or give feedback on legislation. Get started by using the form found here.\n\nKnow How to Register to Vote\n\nWhile the voting age in the United States is 18 years old, research shows young people ages 18 to 29 have a tendency to not vote. However, millennials and Gen Z are beginning to change that statistic, with broader numbers of youth voter turnout in recent years. In the teen years, it\u2019s important for youth to begin to understand their voters rights and be prepared to register to vote so they are ready when they reach that milestone. In some states, preregistration for voting begins at age 16.\n\nIdeas for Middle Schoolers to Learn Civics (Ages 8-12)\n\nHold a Mock Election\n\nTeach youth to be informed voters by hosting a mock election. Whether a local election or presidential election is coming up, create a ballot with the actual candidates running. Before casting a ballot, explore and discuss each candidate\u2019s policy and solutions. Tally up the votes prior to the election and compare your results to the real election. Another option is to create a class cabinet, asking students to run for president, vice president, etc. and sharing the solutions they\u2019d work to create.\n\nBring Civics into Focus\n\nBoys & Girls Clubs of America\u2019s digital learning platform, MyFuture, has several activities to make civics fun for kids. Try out Fact or Fake to learn how to identify credible information found online. In Photo Advocate, youth can use photography to advocate for an issue or cause that matters to them.\n\nIdeas for Civic Education for Kids (Ages 5-8)\n\nRead Up\n\nAge-appropriate books are a great way to introduce civics, history and community engagement to children. Open a picture book or early reading book to make learning about a complex topic easier.\n\nTake a Family Vote\n\nFind small ways to introduce voting concepts to children. Allow parents and siblings to cast their vote on dinner menus, family outings or other fun everyday activities. Make sure to follow through with the winning selection.\n\nGo to the Polls\n\nPerhaps the best way to teach kids about voting is to model the behavior. In most districts, children can accompany parents to the polls \u2013 just check with your election office first and try to avoid busy times where you\u2019re stuck in long lines. Ask for an extra \u201cI Voted\u201d sticker for kids that come along. If your child isn\u2019t joining you at the polls, discuss your right to vote and how you\u2019ll be casting your ballot soon. Share where you go to vote, how the poll workers volunteer their time and what happens once you\u2019re inside.\n\nFrom teens and politics, to younger kids learning about community engagement, there are lots of ways for kids to learn about civics and herald in election day.\n\nStay in the Know\n\nBoys & Girls Clubs of America provides mentorship, programs and meaningful life experiences that boost youth self-esteem, build confidence and contribute to overall positive and healthy wellbeing.

        "text": "40 Months Since the Jan. 6 Attack on the Capitol\nMonday, May 6, 2024, marks 40 months since the attack on the U.S. Capitol that disrupted a joint session of the U.S. Congress in the process of affirming the presidential election results. The government continues to investigate losses that resulted from the breach of the Capitol, including damage to the Capitol building and grounds, both inside and outside the building. As of October 14, 2022, the approximate losses suffered as a result of the siege at the Capitol totaled $2,881,360.20. That amount reflects, among other things, damage to the Capitol building and grounds and certain costs borne by the U.S. Capitol Police.\n\nUnder the continued leadership of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia and the FBI\u2019s Washington Field Office, the investigation and prosecution of those responsible for the attack continues to move forward at an unprecedented speed and scale. The Department of Justice\u2019s resolve to hold accountable those who committed crimes on January 6, 2021, has not, and will not, wane.\n\nBased on the public court documents, below is a snapshot of the investigation as of the close of business May 3, 2024. Complete versions of most of the public court documents used to compile these statistics are available on the Capitol Breach Investigation Resource Page at https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/capitol-breach-cases.\n\nArrests made: More than 1,424 defendants have been charged in nearly all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

Approximately 140 police officers were assaulted on Jan. 6 at the Capitol, including about 80 from the U.S. Capitol Police and about 60 from the Metropolitan Police Department.\n\ndefendants have been charged with assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers or employees, including approximately individuals who have been charged with using a deadly or dangerous weapon or causing serious bodily injury to an officer.\n\nApproximately 11 individuals have been arrested on a series of charges that relate to assaulting a member of the media, or destroying their equipment, on Jan. 6.\n\nindividuals have been arrested on a series of charges that relate to assaulting a member of the media, or destroying their equipment, on Jan. 6. Approximately 1,334 defendants have been charged with entering or remaining in a restricted federal building or grounds. Of those, 127 defendants have been charged with entering a restricted area with a dangerous or deadly weapon.\n\nApproximately 79 defendants have been charged with destruction of government property, and approximately 62 defendants have been charged with theft of government property.\n\nMore than 355 defendants have been charged with corruptly obstructing, influencing, or impeding an official proceeding, or attempting to do so.\n\nApproximately 57 defendants have been charged with conspiracy, either: (a) conspiracy to obstruct a congressional proceeding, (b) conspiracy to obstruct law enforcement during a civil disorder, (c) conspiracy to injure an officer, or (d) some combination of the three.\n\nPleas:\n\nApproximately 820 individuals have pleaded guilty to a variety of federal charges, many of whom faced or will face incarceration at sentencing. Approximately 255 have pleaded guilty to felonies. Another 565 have pleaded guilty to misdemeanors. A total of 97 of those who have pleaded guilty to felonies have pleaded to federal charges of assaulting law enforcement officers. Approximately 58 additional defendants have pleaded guilty to feloniously obstructing, impeding, or interfering with a law enforcement officer during a civil disorder. Of these 155 defendants, 145 have now been sentenced to prison terms of up to 151 months. Four of those who have pleaded guilty to felonies have pleaded guilty to the federal charge of seditious conspiracy.\n\nindividuals have pleaded guilty to a variety of federal charges, many of whom faced or will face incarceration at sentencing.\n\nTrials :\n\n162 individuals have been found guilty at contested trials, including 3 who were found guilty in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.

Approximately 541 have been sentenced to periods of incarceration. Approximately 172 defendants have been sentenced to a period of home detention, including approximately 31 who also were sentenced to a period of incarceration.\n\nPublic Assistance:\n\nCitizens from around the country have provided invaluable assistance in identifying individuals in connection with the Jan. 6 attack. The FBI continues to seek the public\u2019s help in identifying individuals believed to have committed violent acts on Capitol grounds. Those photos can be found at fbi.gov/capitolviolence\n\nAdditionally, the FBI currently has 10 videos of suspects wanted for violent assaults on federal officers, including (ONE) video of (TWO) suspects wanted for assaults on members of the media on January 6th and is seeking the public\u2019s help to identify them.\n\nSome of the violent offenders about whom the FBI is seeking public tips to identify or locate include Evan Neumann, Adam Villarreal, Paul Belosic, AFOs #91, #292, #371, and #383. AFO #91 uses what appears to be a stick to strike multiple officers numerous times while in the doorway of the Lower West Terrace, commonly referred to as the tunnel. AFOs #292, #371, and #383 are all shown on video charging at and assaulting officers, and they appear to grab and attempt to take possession of the officers\u2019 batons.\n\nFor images and video of the attackers, please visit https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/capitol-violence.

        "text": "For Latin American Leaders, Venezuela Looms Large in U.S. Presidential Election\nAlthough it won't be streamed or broadcast, across the political spectrum, America's media firmament has been all-consumed with the specter of former President Trump's so-called hush-money trial in New York City, where he is facing 34 felony charges for falsifying business records and engaging in election interference. But Americans aren't the only ones watching this courtroom drama play out; the rest of the world is also paying very close attention not only to the trial itself but to how its outcome may impact the contours of the upcoming presidential contest, and most importantly, American foreign policy in the years ahead.\n\nFor America's neighbors to the south in Latin America and the Caribbean, the unpredictability of the U.S. political process is always a source of concern. Newsweek spoke to the former president of Colombia, Iv\u00e1n Duque, to get his thoughts on how leaders in the region are viewing the spectacle of this upcoming presidential cycle.\n\n\"There's a lot of interest and anxiety and ... a lot of uncertainty,\" said Duque, who was in office from 2018-2022, working with both the Trump and Biden administrations. \"[Everyone] wants to know how policy with Latin America is going to evolve in the years to come.\"\n\nFor Duque and many other regional leaders, by far the biggest area of concern revolves around how the next American president will deal with the region's resident troublemaker, Venezuela. The oil-rich country is a perpetual source of instability and agitation, and in particular, strongman Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who has held on to power by relying on his \"intelligence services ... to repress opposition to the government,\" where \"crimes and violations, amounting to crimes against humanity, including extremely grave acts of torture were committed,\" according to a recent United Nations report.\n\nAlthough Maduro and his failed-state authoritarian government have been charged by the U.S. Department of Justice on a battery of crimes including narco-terrorism and drug trafficking, Venezuela's role as a key oil producer has consistently enabled his regime to skate by relatively unscathed.\n\nAside from clamping down on dissenters, Maduro has made a habit of cozying up to some of the biggest nemeses of the U.S., namely China, Russia, and Iran.\n\nThe result of all this misconduct and malfeasance has forced the Maduro regime to deal with on-again, off-again sanctions from both the Trump and Biden administrations, although some argue they only hardened Maduro's grip on power. But sanctions are a clumsy tool in the foreign policy toolbox; they often punish those at the base of the economic pyramid while hardening the resolve of those at the top whose behavior they are seeking to modify. Such is the case in Venezuela where the Biden administration had agreed to temporarily lift some of the most severe Trump-era sanctions in the hopes that Maduro would allow for open elections, only to have to recently re-instate those very same sanctions after it became abundantly clear that Maduro wasn't making good on his promises.\n\nNearly 8 million Venezuelans\u2014roughly a fifth of the country's population\u2014have fled since Maduro came to power, setting off one of the largest refugee and migrant crises on the planet, impacting the social and economic fabric of many countries across the region, and ultimately, the dynamics of U.S. political discourse around immigration policy and border security.\n\nA voting booth is seen. A voting booth is seen. Jim Vondruska/Getty Images\n\nMany leaders believe that the next U.S. president\u2014be it Biden or Trump\u2014will be forced to clamp down on the Venezuelan regime even harder\u2014or engage directly with Venezuela head on; they are growing increasingly alarmed by Maduro's latest gambit\u2014his spurious claims to nearly two-thirds of the territory of neighboring Guyana, a close ally of the U.S. and an emerging oil powerhouse that the White House sees as essential to stabilizing global energy markets.\n\nIn a move straight out of Russian President Vladimir Putin's playbook, Maduro announced the creation of a new Venezuelan state inside of Guyana\u2014even appointing an interim governor\u2014a maneuver that some fear is a preamble to an eventual military incursion. Such a move would likely lead to a swift response by the U.S. and draw in regional powers like Brazil, but having U.S. boots on the ground in South America wouldn't sit too well with locals either.\n\n\"Maduro is desperate to remain in power and he's trying to use Guyana as a scapegoat in his nationalistic speech,\" Duque told Newsweek.\n\nYet when it comes to Venezuela, there are no easy answers. However, leaders across Latin America know that, one way or another, the next president of the United States will have almost no choice but to get involved.\n\nBut how exactly the U.S. decides to deal with Venezuela might be very different depending on who is sitting in the Oval Office, which is why, all over Latin America, leaders are watching this election very closely.\n\nArick Wierson is a six-time Emmy Award-winning television producer and served as a senior media and political adviser to former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

I haven't seen anything quite like this, not only in Panama but any other Latin American country that I could think of,\" said Michael Shifter, a senior fellow at the Inter-American Dialogue. \"Panama is in for a tumultuous period.\"\n\nPreliminary results showed that more than 77% of eligible voters cast ballots, a historic turnout in a country where voting is not obligatory, further underscoring the importance of the election in the minds of Panamanians.\n\nPanama doesn't have a runoff system, so the candidate with the biggest share of votes wins.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMulino, running under the Achieving Goals and Alliance parties, faced off against anti-corruption candidate Ricardo Lombana, who trailed in second, former President Mart\u00edn Torrijos and former candidate R\u00f3mulo Roux.\n\nAll three conceded Sunday evening, and outgoing President Laurentino Cortizo's office said he called Mulino to offer congratulations and pledge to work with him for an orderly transition.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Matias Delacroix/AP Matias Delacroix/AP\n\nMulino's ties with Martinelli are what seemed to pull him across the finish line. Mulino ran on the promise to usher in another wave of economic prosperity, and stop migration through the Darien Gap, the perilous jungle region overlapping Colombia and Panama that was traversed by half a million migrants last year.\n\nThe lawyer also vowed to help his ally in his legal woes. After voting Sunday, Mulino strolled into the Nicaraguan Embassy trailed by photographers and wrapped Martinelli in a big hug, saying, \"Brother, we're going to win!\"\n\nBefore even half of the votes had been counted, supporters in Mulino's campaign headquarters erupted in celebration, singing and waving flags.\n\nMartinelli posted a blurry photo of his own face on the X social media platform, writing: \"This is the face of a happy and content man.\" Now that Mulino is on his way in, what remains unclear is if the president-elect will become \"Martinelli's puppet\" or if he'll chart his own path, Shifter said.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Matias Delacroix/AP Matias Delacroix/AP\n\nDespite the fatigue of endemic corruption in Panama, many voters like Juan Jos\u00e9 Tinoco were willing to overlook the other corruption scandals plaguing their former leader in favor of the humming economy seen during his presidency. The 63-year-old bus driver voted for Mulino from his working-class area of small, concrete houses surrounded by extravagant skyscrapers.\n\n\"We have problems with health services, education, we have garbage in the streets ... and corruption that never goes away,\" Tinoco said. \"We have money here. This is a country that has lots of wealth, but we need a leader who dedicates himself to the needs of Panama.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe presidential race had been in uncertain waters until Friday morning, when Panama's Supreme Court ruled that Mulino was permitted to run. It said he was eligible despite allegations that his candidacy wasn't legitimate because he wasn't elected in a primary.\n\nMulino faces an uphill battle moving forward, on the economy especially. Last year, the Central American nation was roiled for weeks by mass anti-government protests, which came to encapsulate deeper discontent among citizens.\n\nThe protests targeted a government contract with a copper mine, which critics said endangered the environment and water at a time when drought has gotten so bad that it has effectively handicapped trade transit through the Panama Canal.\n\nWhile many celebrated in November when the country's Supreme Court declared the contract unconstitutional, the mine closure and slashed canal transit will put Panama's new leader in a tight spot.\n\nMeanwhile, the country's debt is skyrocketing and much of the economy has slowed, said Shifter, of Inter-American Dialogue, making it even harder for Mulino to regularize canal transit and staunch soaring levels of migration through the Darien Gap.\n\n\"Panama is at a very different moment than it's been over the last 30 years,\" Shifter said. Mulino \"is going to face formidable obstacles. I mean, it's going to be a daunting task for him.\"",

His next closest rival, Ricardo Lombana, took second place with about 25%.\n\nMulino has pledged to return the country to its economic heyday and to tackle high unemployment with a plan to incentivize private hiring with government funds.\n\nThe Central American nation of 4.4 million people, once a GDP leader in the region, is at the crossroads international trade and migration in the region but faces a range of pressing issues from high inflation and unemployment to corruption and water access.\n\n\u201cI receive with joy these results, which are the will of the majority of the Panamanian people in our democracy, which I assume with great responsibility and humility as a Panamanian,\u201d Mulino said during his victory speech.\n\nHe originally ran as the vice-presidential candidate of former President Ricardo Martinelli. After a court sentenced Martinelli to 11 years in prison for money laundering, Mulino moved to the top of the ticket.\n\nMartinelli has been holed up in the Nicaraguan embassy in Panama\u2019s capital after he sought asylum following his sentencing. The former leader continued to play a role in the race by endorsing and supporting his former vice-presidential pick.\n\nMulino, who is widely seen as having inherited Martinelli\u2019s popular support, thanked the former president in his victory speech.\n\n\u201cTo Ricardo Martinelli: my friend, mission accomplished Ricardo. When you invited me to be vice president, I did not imagine this scenario, but it was my turn, and I took it on with enormous responsibility and humility,\u201d he said.\n\nVoters walk inside a polling station during a general election in Panama City, Sunday, May 5, 2024 Matias Delacroix/AP\n\nPolitical pundits have dubbed the election \u201cthe most important since after the US invasion\u201d in 1989.\n\nMulino will take over a country that is polarized and fraught with politician tension and uncertainties.\n\nPanama\u2019s economy has slowed dramatically in recent years, with the IMF forecasting GDP growth of only 2.5 percent this year, down from 7.3 percent last year. In March, credit agency Fitch downgraded Panama\u2019s rating to junk status citing \u201cfiscal and governance challenges\u201d after the country closed its largest mine last year.\n\nMulino has also vowed to shut down the Dari\u00e9n Gap, the treacherous stretch of jungle beginning in Panama that\u2019s become a main highway for migrants making their way to the US.\n\nMore than half a million migrants, mostly from Venezuela, crossed through the Dari\u00e9n Gap in 2023, according to the Panamanian government, doubling the amount recorded in 2022.\n\nThe US has been working for months with officials in Panama and Colombia, where the jungle ends, to attempt to shut down the route. But Mulino has not said how he would carry out a closure of the jungle to migrants.\n\nWater access also topped voter\u2019s minds during the vote, analysts say. Droughts exacerbated by El Nino have made access to potable water scarce in some regions and reduced the capacity of the Panama Canal, a centerpiece of the country\u2019s GDP.",

It always depends on the fairness of an election.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf everything\u2019s honest, I\u2019ll gladly accept the results,\u201d he later told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. \u201cIf it\u2019s not, you have to fight for the right of the country.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Trump says \u201cit depends,\u201d here\u2019s the problem: He has never competed in an election that he acknowledged as fair.\n\nEven when he won the presidential election of 2016, he claimed that Hillary Clinton and the Democrats rigged the count to deny him a popular-vote landslide, contending without evidence that millions of noncitizens had voted in California. The official inquiry he ordered up found no significant irregularities.\n\nIn 2020, when he lost to President Biden by 7 million votes, Trump not only claimed the result was illegitimate; he worked for months to overturn it, demanding that state officials \u201cfind\u201d thousands of new votes in his favor. When his court challenges failed, he summoned supporters to Washington and urged them to march on the Capitol.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t fight like hell, you won\u2019t have a country any more,\u201d he told them. The mob responded by invading the building.\n\nHe returned to that apocalyptic theme last week, when he told supporters in Wisconsin that if Biden wins a second term, \u201cwe won\u2019t have a country left.\u201d\n\nPolitics Biden\u2019s big move on marijuana: Will voters give him credit? The Biden administration soon will take a big step toward bringing federal policy on weed more in line with what the public says it prefers.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden is destroying our country,\u201d Trump said at a rally. \u201cThe enemy from within is more dangerous than China and Russia. ... I actually think our country is not going to survive.\u201d\n\nIt was as if he was priming his followers for extreme measures if he doesn\u2019t prevail.\n\nAnd it was part of a long pattern. In January, he warned that if his four criminal indictments prevent him from winning, the result will be \u201cbedlam in the country.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the opening of a Pandora\u2019s box,\u201d he warned.\n\nIn March, he posted a video on his social media account showing an image of Biden hog-tied like a prisoner.\n\nAnd for months he has extolled the defendants convicted of violent crimes in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection as \u201chostages,\u201d promising to pardon many or all if he is reelected.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s telling us what his intentions are, as he did before Jan. 6,\u201d Juliette Kayyem, a terrorism expert at Harvard University, said recently on PBS. \u201cThe language is the language of incitement. ... If he loses, we certainly know from what Trump has said \u2014 and we also know from what the FBI is telling us \u2014 that there are large groups and organizations that are preparing to continue the fight.\u201d\n\nAs matters stand in the presidential campaign, that kind of 2020-style crisis may not recur, since Trump stands a good chance of winning.\n\nThe average of public opinion polls published by fivethirtyeight.com shows a dead heat in the national popular vote \u2014 but it shows Trump winning in all six of the most important swing states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nTrump used a day off from his New York criminal trial Wednesday to campaign in Michigan and Wisconsin, where he returned to his warnings about an unfair election process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe radical-left Democrats rigged the presidential election in 2020,\u201d he claimed untruthfully yet again. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to allow them to rig the presidential election in 2024. We won\u2019t have a country left ... 2024 is our final battle.\u201d\n\nFor months, Biden has sought to remind voters that Trump, if reelected, would run roughshod over the norms of American government and politics.\n\n\u201cDemocracy is on the ballot,\u201d the president often says.\n\nBy reminding voters that he doesn\u2019t accept the duty to recognize the result of an election he loses, Trump has paradoxically bolstered Biden\u2019s case.\n\nFor some voters, this election may come down to a choice between preserving democracy and hoping for a return of the low inflation of the Trump years. They may not find it an easy choice.\n\nA survey last year by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 38% of Americans believe the country needs \u201ca leader who is willing to break some rules if that\u2019s what it takes to set things right.\u201d That substantial minority included 48% of Republicans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Time\u2019s reporter asked Trump whether his rhetoric about overriding the Constitution and ruling as a \u201cdictator for a day\u201d might alienate voters, the former president disagreed.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of people like it,\u201d he said.\n\nUnfortunately, he\u2019s right.",

        "text": "IDJC Report Tracks Influence of Social Media Ads on Presidential Primaries\nMedia, Law & Policy\n\nMore than 1,800 groups have collectively spent an estimated $15.3 million to pay for social media advertising that mentions President Joe Biden, former President Donald Trump or other presidential candidates, according to a new report from Syracuse University\u2019s Institute for Democracy, Journalism and Citizenship (IDJC).\n\nResearch from the IDJC ElectionGraph project found that the millions paid for more than 24,000 ad buys and about 5,500 unique ads on Facebook and Instagram between Sept. 1, 2023, and Feb. 29, 2024. This amounts to an estimated 869 million impressions in the months leading up to, and during, the presidential primaries. The majority of ads involved Biden or Trump, the report found.\n\nThe Biden and Trump campaigns spent another roughly $10 million on paid social media content, drawing 303 million impressions, though the incumbent outspent Trump about 7-to-1 on these platforms.\n\nThis is the first report produced via research supported by a $250,000 grant from Neo4j, the world\u2019s leading graph database and analytics company. The grant allows ElectionGraph researchers to use Neo4j\u2019s graph database and analytics software to identify misinformation trends in the U.S. presidential election and other top 2024 contests.\n\nThe research team\u2019s efforts focus on dissecting misinformation themes\u2014pinpointing origins of messages and tracing misinformation by collecting and algorithmically classifying ads run on Facebook and Instagram, as well as social media posts on Facebook and X, formerly known as Twitter. The project will also gather input from journalists and the public about the 2024 presidential election, and races for U.S. Senate and key congressional districts.\n\nThe first set of findings released today demonstrate the importance of requiring social media platforms to disclose details about election advertising and messaging, says Jennifer Stromer-Galley, senior associate dean and professor at the School of Information Studies. An expert in political campaigns and misinformation, Stromer-Galley leads the IDJC ElectionGraph research team.\n\n\u201cRevealing details about ads and messaging on social media platforms is vital to provide the public with transparency and context,\u201d Stromer-Galley says. \u201cFailure to do so can make voters more vulnerable to manipulation without any sort of accountability.\u201d\n\nOrganizations that ran ads ranged from well-known political action committees, political party groups or other candidates, to obscure players with harder-to-trace ties and agendas, the report found. The analysis identifies the top 30 spenders that each mention Biden and Trump, and examines patterns in how groups apply the honorific of \u201cPresident\u201d when referring to either candidate.\n\nThe report captures a fraction of overall U.S. election-related content across all social media platforms. While Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, currently allows approved organizations to access ad data, it is not required to be made available\u2014and not similarly trackable\u2014on TikTok, Google, YouTube or Snapchat.\n\n\u201cThese findings give us a glimpse at the firehose of information and misinformation coming at voters from groups with a jumble of motives, ties and trustworthiness ahead of the 2024 elections,\u201d says Margaret Talev, Kramer Director of the IDJC, professor of practice at the Newhouse School of Public Communications and a journalist.\n\nThe challenge faced by digital researchers and computational journalists in unearthing the consequences of AI-driven misinformation on democracy is enormous, says Jim Webber, chief scientist at Neo4j.\n\n\u201cGraph technology is an essential enabler to those seeking to uncover hidden patterns and networks of those looking to manipulate democratic populations,\u201d Webber says.\n\n\u201cWe at Neo4j are proud to support Syracuse University\u2019s mission to help journalists and citizens separate fact from fake news so that the voting public can make informed decisions as they go to the polls.\u201d",

        "text": "U.S. Presidential Election 2024: Immigration, Joe Biden's other Achilles' Heel\nAs usual at this time of year, there is a crowd in front of the steel arch of the University of Georgia (UGA). People wait to have their photo taken: tradition dictates that young graduates don their gowns and pose at the top of the steps leading to the campus entrance. The graduation ceremony isn\u2019t expected to take place for a few more days. However, with the clear weather conditions, many opt to immortalize their academic achievement sooner to avoid the crowds on the official date.\n\nDespite some attempts to rally in support of Gaza, the mood is once again light in Athens. However, no one has forgotten the tragedy that struck the university at the end of February \u2013 the murder of a nursing student on campus. The crime shocked the peaceful town, and the news immediately became national during this election year due to the fact that the accused, Jose Antonio Ibarra, is a Venezuelan migrant who entered the United States illegally at the end of 2022. Moreover, he had been arrested twice before the tragedy, in New York and Athens, for an incident involving a moped and for shoplifting.\n\nIn the eyes of Republicans, Ibarra became a symbol of the crisis at the U.S. - Mexico Mexican and a symptom of Joe Biden's \"criminal negligence.\" Subsequently, a bill named after the victim from Athens, Laken Hope Riley, was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives. The bill, which would still need to pass in the Senate, provides for the incarceration of any undocumented immigrant guilty of any offense, whatever it may be, until deportation.\n\nAt the Mexican border, a situation beyond Biden's control\n\nFor Republican nominee and former U.S. president Donald Trump, the tragedy was viewed as an opportunity not to be missed, especially since Georgia has become a key swing state in the November election. His surprising defeat in the conservative Southern state weighed heavily in the balance in 2020. Four years later, the former president hopes to reconquer the traditionally Republican state with Riley\u2019s tragic death. \"Republicans will certainly put a lot of money into this come November; this issue will not disappear,\u201d said Brian Robinson, who has advised GOP candidates in Georgia for more than 25 years. The return on investment is more than likely.\n\nImmigration, as well as his advanced age, is among Joe Biden's greatest weak points in this election and the situation at the Mexican border seems to be slipping out of his control. Since 2021, the number of monthly arrivals has regularly exceeded 200,000 migrants, a figure not seen since 2000. Unable to manage this influx, authorities must allow many asylum seekers to enter the United States, while waiting for their cases to be processed, which can take several years. This isn\u2019t new, but the phenomenon has only intensified since the Democratic president took office.\n\nScott Chitwood is the sheriff of Dalton, a small town in northwest Georgia that has been home to many Hispanic migrants since the 1990s, attracted by its flooring and carpet manufacturing industry. Although a Democrat, he criticized Biden's immigration policy: \"The president did not want Trump's wall, and since then, it's been an open door,\" he lamented. \"I have no problem with immigration. There are no more criminals among immigrants than among Americans, contrary to what the media says. But they must enter legally.\"\n\nImmigration: Americans' main concern\n\nNumerous surveys have confirmed that immigration is among the top issues for Americans. In March, when asked by Gallup, 28% of people placed the subject first in their list of concerns, far ahead of the general state of the economy (12%) or inflation (11%). For roughly 8 out of 10 Americans, illegal immigration is a \"serious or very serious problem,\" according to a study by Monmouth University. Since 2019, the year of the previous edition of this survey when Donald Trump was still in the White House, this sentiment has greatly increased. Even among Democrats, 41% think it is \"a very serious problem,\" compared to 26% in 2019.\n\nFor a majority of Americans, Biden is the main culprit for this situation and the solution proposed by Trump in 2016 of a border wall is now supported by 53% of those surveyed. Aware of the danger, Biden has hardened his rhetoric in recent months, going so far as to incorporate some proposals from his opponent \u2013 the possibility, under certain conditions, of border closure, of returning migrants to Mexico, etc. - into a bill that was blocked by Republicans, at Trump's behest, who refused to give Biden an exit strategy.\n\nSince 2024, a decrease in migrant arrivals\n\n\"We know very well that the administration is acting in this way because of the November presidential election,\" Robinson said. \"In 2020, Joe Biden said that building a wall was immoral, that America was a nation of immigrants. The message was received not only in Latin America, but also China, India, and so forth. We have seen people arrive from everywhere since then. It will stick to him in November.\"\n\nIn speaking out, Biden hopes to reverse the tide on the banks of the Rio Grande, even if migration policies are complex. It depends on the obscure logic of cartels, the attitude of authorities along the migrant route, and the political situations in the migrants\u2019 countries of origin. Nevertheless, since the beginning of the year, the number of migrants knocking on the doors of the United States has been decreasing, with fewer than 130,000 arrivals per month. However, this decrease is not enough to sway the political landscape.\n\nTrump's wall, seven years after its announcement\n\nIn line with his campaign promise, Trump signed an executive order in January 2017 directing the construction of a border wall to complement and strengthen existing sections.\n\nAs of January 5, 2021, the wall reaches a total length of 452 miles (727 km), less than half of the 1,600 km promised by the Republican. The cost of the works ultimately amounts to $15 billion, but contrary to the initial promise of the Republican president in 2017, Mexico has not paid a cent.\n\nLast October, Biden, despite his reservations about this wall, announced that other sections would still be built, as he failed to persuade Congress to allocate budgets to other projects.",

        "text": "How US presidential election years affect the market\nNew York CNN \u2014\n\nElections do have consequences. But if the past century is any guide, the long-term consequences of US presidential election years on investor portfolios, including 401(k)s, is minimal at best.\n\nA recent analysis by retirement planning firm TIAA considered how a moderate-risk portfolio with 60% stocks and 40% bonds fared across all presidential election years since 1928. Turns out there were only four years that had negative returns: 1932 (down 1.4%); 1940 (down 4.7%); 2000 (down 0.8%); and 2008 (down 20.1%).\n\nUnsurprisingly, those four presidential election years occurred at times of seismic events: The Great Depression. World War II. The implosion of the tech bubble. And the housing and financial crisis that created the Great Recession.\n\nBut, over time, those negative returns didn\u2019t move the needle in terms of long-term average performance. TIAA found that a 60/40 portfolio had an average annual return of 8.7% across the 24 presidential election years since 1928 \u2014 just a hair above the 8.5% average for the same portfolio during all non-election years over that same period.\n\n\u201cOver a very long period of time, it washes out,\u201d said Niladri Mukherjee, chief investment officer at TIAA.\n\nOf course, very few investors have a portfolio in play for that long and even fewer maintain the same stock-to-bond ratio throughout.\n\nBut even if you look at shorter time horizons and just focus on stocks, the same general trend appears to hold.\n\nThe S&P 500 alone has generated an average return of 7% during presidential election years since 1952, according to LPL Financial. If you limit that to presidential election years in which the incumbent president is running for reelection, the average jumps to 12.2%.\n\n\u201cWe believe this pattern is partly due to the incumbent priming the pump ahead of the election with fiscal stimulus and pro-growth regulatory policies to stave off potential recession and encourage job growth,\u201d Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL, wrote in a December 2023 blog post about his firm\u2019s analysis.\n\nMarket performance will be about more than who becomes president\n\nWhat about this election year? Whether the winner is President Joe Biden or former President Donald Trump, how the markets react in the short term are difficult to predict. \u201cElection years come with higher levels of volatility,\u201d Mukherjee said.\n\nThe longer-term consequences in the markets are even harder to gauge.\n\nWhile past performance is no guarantee of future results, if history is any guide, investors will factor their decisions going forward based on fundamentals in the United States and around the world, as well as the risks of geopolitical unrest, Mukherjee said.\n\nIn other words, he noted, economic growth, corporate profits, inflation, standard of living and productivity will remain paramount.\n\nMarket analysts from US Bank echoed similar sentiments in a report late last year. \u201cEconomic and inflation trends have demonstrated a stronger and more consistent relationship with market returns than election results,\u201d they wrote.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, how the House and Senate take shape will play a big role in how policies are achieved.\n\n\u201cThe makeup of Congress is really important when it comes to fiscal policy and real changes that can be implemented,\u201d Mukherjee said. \u201cEven though (presidential) candidates say a lot of things, they may not be able to implement them.\u201d\n\nWhat all this means for the average investor\n\nGenerally speaking, no one can consistently and successfully time the market or predict the future. So, being sufficiently diversified across different asset classes and sectors, while also very conservatively investing money you\u2019ll need in the next few years, has always been sensible advice.\n\nSo if you\u2019re anxious about the upcoming election \u2014 or just dead certain US and global markets will react one way or the other depending on the winner \u2014 Mukherjee recommends not making investment decisions based on your predictions. Instead, he suggests you consult with a financial adviser to make sure your current allocations fit well with your time horizon, risk tolerance and goals. Or, if those already do, maybe just sit tight.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not going to make a change in a nonelection year, you shouldn\u2019t do so in a presidential election year,\u201d Mukherjee said.\n\nYou also may want to consider some useful tips on how to avoid investing based on your strong feelings from psychologist Daniel Crosby, who wrote \u201cThe Behavioral Investor.\u201d\n\nFor instance, Crosby warns, if your fears are activated, you can panic and sell at the wrong time, he said. Or, if you\u2019re elated, your optimism may distort your level of risk in an investment.",

        "text": "What\u2019s at stake in Chad\u2019s presidential election?\nChad has been battling political upheaval since 2021 when longtime ruler Idriss Deby died and his son seized power.\n\nChadians head to the polls on Monday to elect a new president in what could be the nation\u2019s most-watched election in three decades.\n\nThe polls will mark the end of a transition to democracy by the ruling military government, one of several currently in power in West and Central Africa. But some experts say the vote is just to formalise the military\u2019s hold on power.\n\nChad has been in the throes of political upheaval since 2021, when interim President Mahamat Idriss Deby first seized power amid fierce resistance by opposition forces who challenged his legitimacy.\n\nThis February, the chaos crescendoed after government forces fatally shot Yaya Dillo \u2013 one of the strongest opposition figures \u2013 and his supporters at their party headquarters in the capital, N\u2019Djamena.\n\nAt the same time, Chad is one of the poorest countries in the world, with at least 40 percent of the 17 million population living below the poverty line. The war in neighbouring Sudan has also pushed more than 500,000 people into Chad, adding further pressure even as fears of a spillover conflict simmer.\n\nChad\u2019s army, reputed to be among the best in the region, commands influence across the troubled Sahel, where armed group incursions and a wave of coups have created regional rifts and diminished the standing of Western powers like France and the United States.\n\n\u201c[Chad] is a key security partner in the fight against [armed group] Boko Haram around Lake Chad,\u201d said Dan Eizenga, a researcher with the Africa Center for Strategic Studies (ACSS). \u201cSo, the electoral process in Chad has significant ramifications not just for Chad, but for several countries.\u201d\n\nFrance, a key backer of Chad\u2019s current government, enjoys a large military presence in the country. However, the US appears on shaky ground. Last month, the Pentagon announced it would pull out some 75 troops stationed in the country, but added the decision could change after the elections \u2013 signalling the importance of the May 6 polls beyond the continent.\n\nA second round of votes is expected on June 22, with provisional results due on July 7.\n\nHere\u2019s all you need to know about the candidates and state of play ahead of the Monday vote:\n\nWho is running?\n\nThe country\u2019s Constitutional Council approved 10 candidates in March, although fierce criticism abounds for the barring of some opposition figures because of \u201cirregularities\u201d in their applications.\n\nThe main candidate, General Mahamat Idriss Deby, is the transitional president who came to power under the ruling Patriotic Salvation Movement party (MPS). He will run under the \u201cUnited Chad\u201d coalition, which consists of several other pro-government parties.\n\nDeby, 39, took office in April 2021, after his father, President Idriss Deby, died in action while fighting a rebel group in the north of the country. Until his death, Deby had ruled for more than 30 years.\n\nFollowing the older Deby\u2019s death, the military suspended the constitution and announced a decree establishing a Transitional Military Council to lead the country for 18 months and designating Mahamat Deby as head of the Council, and thus, head of state.\n\nDeby is one of Chad\u2019s youngest leaders, but his critics, unimpressed, have criticised him since day one for grabbing power illegally, and have asked him to step down. According to the constitution, the head of parliament ought to rule in the case of the president\u2019s death.\n\nInstead, Deby extended the transition period by several months to October 10, 2024. In a bid to legitimise his position, experts say, Deby signed peace agreements with major opposition figures in 2022.\n\nHe also proposed changes to the constitution in a referendum. In December 2023, Chadians voted \u201cyes\u201d to new measures such as the creation of local councils to devolve power from the centre; a presidential term limit reduced from six to five years, and a reduced age limit from 40 to 35 years, as well as the strengthening of the electoral agency by making it independent of the government.\n\nWho are the main opposition figures?\n\nDeby\u2019s three-year rule is reminiscent of his father\u2019s style: iron-fisted and replete with crackdowns on the opposition, such as the protests of October 2022.\n\nMajor opposition leaders have been harassed, or in worse cases, killed, like Yaya Dillo, who was a cousin of Deby. Saleh Deby Itno, another one of Deby\u2019s relatives who was allied with Dillo, was jailed.\n\nMeanwhile, Deby has aimed to co-opt other opposition members, appointing them to high positions, a strategy that the older Deby also wielded many times.\n\nThe main approved opposition candidates for the elections include:\n\nSucces Masra \u2013 Deby\u2019s appointed prime minister and a Harvard and Oxford-educated economist, Masra was the strongest opposition figure until his appointment in January 2024, campaigning under the Transformers Party (Les Transformateurs). He was a member of the vocal opposition coalition Wakit Tama, which had started to protest the long rule of the older Deby in 2021. Following Deby senior\u2019s death and the takeover by his son, Masra led opposition protests against what was called a \u201ccoup\u201d. He fled the country to the US after the army opened fire on hundreds of protesters in N\u2019Djamena on October 20, 2022, after Deby announced he would run in elections, rather than hand over power. At least 50 people were killed.\n\nHowever, Masra returned to Chad in December 2023, after peace talks with Deby\u2019s government, overseen by the regional Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) bloc. He was appointed prime minister on January 1, 2024 \u2013 a move intensely criticised by other opposition groups, who said Masra had joined the military government. On May 6, Masra will face his boss and run under the Justice and Equality (Justice-Egalite) coalition. It\u2019s the first time in the country\u2019s history that a president and a prime minister will tussle at the polls, and there are speculations around whether Masra is fronting for Deby.\n\n\u201cMany observers suggest that they may have some sort of gentleman\u2019s deal where whoever wins will name the other their prime minister and thus preserve the status quo,\u201d Eizenga of ACSS said. \u201cSeveral opposition parties \u2026 claim that Masra provides the illusion of electoral competition.\u201d\n\nAlbert Pahimi Padacke \u2013 A two-time former prime minister and one-time presidential candidate under the older Deby, Albert will run under the semi-opposition RNDT-Le Reveil party or the National Rally of Chadian Democrats, which allied with the older Deby\u2019s political party at the time. He came second in the last presidential elections in April 2021.\n\nThe other candidates are:\n\nAlladoum Djarma Baltazar \u2013 a politician and founder of the Chadian Socialist Action Party for Renewal or Action pour le renouveau du Tchad (ASTRE). He also ran for president in the April 2021 elections which the older Deby won for a sixth time, just days before his death.\n\nTheophile Bongoro Bebzoune \u2013 a teacher and president of the Party for the Rally and Equity in Chad or Rassemblement pour la d\u00e9mocratie et le progr\u00e8s (PRET). He is a member of Deby\u2019s Transitional Council.\n\nLydie Beassemda \u2013 the first and only female candidate, and the current minister of education. Beassemda will run under the Party for Democracy and Independence or Parti pour la drmocratie et l\u2019independance integrales. She first ran in 2021, but received only three percent of the vote.\n\nMansiri Lopsekreo \u2013 will run under the Elites party (Les \u00c9lites). He is an engineer and first-time candidate with growing support in northern and eastern Chad.\n\nBrice Mbaimon Guedmbaye \u2013 is running in presidential elections for the third time. He will compete under the banner of the Movement of Chadian Patriots for the Republic or Mouvement des patriotes tchadiens pour la Republique (MPTR).\n\nYacine Abdermane Sakine \u2013 a 39-year-old banker who is popular with the youth. Although running under the Reformist Party (Parti Reformiste), Yacine is also a member of the opposition coalition Wakit Tama and was arrested during protests after the military takeover in 2021.\n\nNasra Djimasngar \u2013 an academic who is running for the first time under his New Day (Un Jour Nouvel) party.\n\nA free and fair vote?\n\nSome experts say the elections are merely a formality to help Deby assure his hold on power. Since the killing of Dillo and the co-option of Masra, there has not been enough time for another strong opposition figure to emerge.\n\n\u201cJust the advantage of incumbency alone in this context makes this Deby\u2019s race to lose, and that\u2019s assuming that it occurs by Chad\u2019s electoral laws,\u201d Eizenga said. \u201cConsequently, Masra and Deby are really the only candidates expected to receive any significant portion of the votes.\u201d\n\nAlthough Deby\u2019s government set up the National Election Management Agency and Constitutional Council in January, as part of new reforms agreed to during peace talks with opposition members, critics say these agencies will tow the ruling party line as some of its commissioners were selected by President Deby.\n\nChad\u2019s economy, already poor, has shrunk in the past decade \u2013 its gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, for instance, fell from $961 in 2014 to $710 in 2019, according to the World Bank. Insecurity and an overreliance on oil revenue are the major drivers. While oil is Chad\u2019s main resource, production is set to decline sharply because its reserves are limited.\n\nWith Deby set to win the election, Chad could see another decades-long strongman ruler, as well as a stagnant economy.\n\n\u201cI suspect that we can look back at the last six years or so and get a good idea of what the next six years will look like: essentially, a heavily tilted economy [and] high levels of corruption that benefit more or less the same networks of politically connected folks,\u201d Eizenga said.\n\nThere are hopes, however, that Prime Minister Masra, a world-class economist, could influence more investments in the country\u2019s education and health sectors.",

        "text": "Six states are toss ups, one leans 'likely Republican' ahead of the 2024 election\nSix swing states have been identified as critical for either candidate to win the 2024 Presidential election in November.\n\nArizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin were determined to be toss-up states, along with their 77 electoral votes, according to The Cook Political Report. North Carolina, and its 16 electoral votes was deemed \u201cLeans Republican\u201d but could still be in play for Democrats.\n\nRoughly 6% of voters in those states will likely be deciders, according to a report by Axios.\n\nMore:Donald Trump trial live updates: Judge threatens Trump with jail time for gag order violations\n\nSign up for Your Vote: Text USA TODAY reporters and the elections team by joining our SMS service.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nBoth presumptive presidential nominees are hitting that 6% hard with their messaging, according to Axios. The Trump campaign has focused on inflation, crime and immigration in its messaging, and the Biden campaign is emphasizing stability, democracy and abortion in its messaging to that 6%.\n\nHow the battleground states voted in 2020\n\nThese states were among the battlegrounds disputed by former President Donald Trump after he lost the 2020 presidential election. President Joe Biden won three of these states by less than a percentage point.\n\nHere\u2019s how the 2020 race shook out in those battleground states.\n\nArizona: Biden won by 0.3%\n\nTrump disputed the election results in the Grand Canyon State after Biden carried Arizona in November 2020 by a 10,457 vote margin with nearly 3.4 million votes cast. Trump has been named an unindicted co-conspirator in a scheme to attempt to install fake electors to flip the results of the election fraudulently. Charges were issued Wednesday against 18 Republicans and former aides to Trump. The defendants are charged with crimes including conspiracy and forgery for falsely claiming they were presidential electors and that Trump won the state in the 2020 election.\n\nGeorgia: Biden won by 0.2%\n\nTrump disputed the results of the 2020 election in Georgia after Biden carried the state by an 11,779-vote margin with nearly 5 million votes cast. A grand jury in Georgia indicted Trump along with 18 defendants in an election interference case. That indictment included dozens of charges, such as violations of Georgia\u2019s racketeering law, impersonating a public officer, and making false statements and writings, among others.\n\nA series of election integrity laws have been passed in the state since 2020 that could limit voter access and potentially overburden election officials.\n\nMichigan: Biden won by 2.8%\n\nMichigan\u2019s attorney general charged 16 people, each with eight crimes, related to the 2020 election. Those charges, handed down in July 2023, include conspiracy to commit forgery and publishing a false record \u201cwith intent to injure or defraud,\u201d among other counts. People charged include a co-chair of the state\u2019s Republican party, a GOP national committeewoman, a former elector, and others active in local government and political leadership.\n\nBiden carried the state with a margin of 154,188 votes with just over 5.5 million cast.\n\nNevada: Biden won by 2.4%\n\nA county grand jury in Nevada charged six Trump electors with two felonies each. Those charges are offering a false instrument and uttering a forged instrument. The individuals charged include state and local GOP leaders.\n\nBiden won Nevada with a margin of 33,596 votes with nearly 1.5 million cast.\n\nPennsylvania: Biden won by 1.2%\n\nTrump attempted to claim victory in Pennsylvania after the election was called for Biden in November 2020. The Pennsylvania attorney general slammed Trump\u2019s claim and called it \u201cdevoid of reality\u201d after the former president attempted to sow doubt in the election results during a post-election GOP event.\n\nBiden won his childhood home state of Pennsylvania by 80,555 votes out of nearly 7 million ballots cast.\n\nWisconsin: Biden won by 0.7%\n\nTen Republicans in Wisconsin signed a document that falsely claimed they were the \u201cduly elected and qualified electors\u201d after Biden won the state in 2020. Biden had won Wisconsin with a margin of 20,682 votes and just over 3 million ballots cast. The Wisconsin attorney general has not said whether his office plans to file charges against the fake electors.\n\nNorth Carolina: Trump won by 1.4%\n\nNorth Carolina was Trump\u2019s narrowest victory in 2020 when he won the state with a margin of 74,481 votes and 5.5 million ballots cast. Democrats are eyeing the state as flippable, but Republicans remain skeptical.\n\nLooking back, looking forward\n\nOut of the roughly 158 million ballots cast for president in 2020, Biden won those six states by approximately 300,000 votes.\n\nTrump needs to bag one of the Midwestern \u201cBlue Wall\u201d states that he lost in 2020 to win a second term, according to Axios successfully.",

It is a follow-up to a similar study conducted in 2018. The survey of 5,146 U.S. adults was conducted from Jan. 22 to 28, 2024. Everyone who completed the survey is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology.

Read our second report, \u201cHow Americans Get Local Political News,\u201d and our third report, \u201cAmericans\u2019 Experiences With Local Crime News.\u201d\n\nThe local news landscape in America is going through profound changes as both news consumers and producers continue to adapt to a more digital news environment. We recently asked U.S. adults about the ways they access local news, as well as their attitudes toward local journalism, finding that:\n\nA growing share of Americans prefer to get local news online, while fewer are getting news on TV or in print.

Most people also say local journalists are in touch with their communities and that their local news media perform well at several aspects of their jobs, such as reporting the news accurately. At the same time, a relatively small share of Americans (15%) say they have paid for local news in the last year. And many seem unaware of the major financial challenges facing local news: A 63% majority (albeit a smaller majority than in 2018) say they think their local news outlets are doing very or somewhat well financially.\n\nAnd many seem unaware of the major financial challenges facing local news: A 63% majority (albeit a smaller majority than in 2018) say they think their local news outlets are doing very or somewhat well financially.

Most Americans say local journalists should remain neutral on issues in their community, but a substantial minority say local journalists should take a more active role. About three-in-ten say local journalists should advocate for change in their communities, a view that\u2019s especially common among Democrats and younger adults.\n\nThese are some of the key findings from a new Pew Research Center survey of about 5,000 U.S. adults conducted in January 2024. This is the first in a series of Pew Research Center reports on local news from the Pew-Knight Initiative, a research program funded jointly by The Pew Charitable Trusts and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation.\n\nAmericans largely hold positive views of local news organizations\n\nAt a time when many local news outlets are struggling and Americans\u2019 trust in the news media has waned, the vast majority of U.S. adults (85%) say local news outlets are at least somewhat important to the well-being of their local community. This includes 44% who say local journalism is extremely or very important to their community\n\nAbout seven-in-ten U.S. adults (69%) say that local journalists in their area are mostly in touch with their community, up from 63% who said this in 2018. And most Americans also say their local news organizations are doing well at four key roles:\n\nReporting news accurately (71%)\n\nCovering the most important stories (68%)\n\nBeing transparent (63%)\n\nKeeping an eye on local political leaders (61%).\n\nThese are relatively positive views compared with how Americans see news organizations more broadly. For instance, a 2022 Pew Research Center survey found that fewer than half of U.S. adults say that news organizations in general do a very or somewhat good job of covering the most important stories, reporting the news accurately and serving as a watchdog over elected leaders.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, views toward local news are not as politically polarized as Americans\u2019 opinions about the news media overall. While Republicans and GOP-leaning independents are not quite as positive as Democrats and Democratic leaners in some of their assessments of local journalists, most Republicans still say the local media in their area are doing their jobs well.\n\nFor example, roughly three-quarters of Democrats (78%) say their local media do well at reporting news accurately, compared with about two-thirds of Republicans (66%).\n\nBy comparison, the 2022 survey found that 51% of Democrats and just 17% of Republicans say that news organizations in general do a very or somewhat good job of reporting the news accurately.\n\nJump to more information on views toward local news organizations.\n\nFewer Americans are closely following local news \u2013 and other types of news\n\nDespite these positive views toward local news organizations, there are signs that Americans are engaging less with local journalism than they used to.\n\nThe share of Americans who say they follow local news very closely has fallen by 15 percentage points since 2016 (from 37% to 22%). Most U.S. adults still say they follow local news at least somewhat closely (66%), but this figure also has dropped in recent years.\n\nThis trend is not unique to local news \u2013 Americans\u2019 attention to national and international news also has declined.\n\nThe local news landscape is becoming more digital\n\nThe ways in which Americans access local news are changing, reflecting an increasingly digital landscape \u2013 and matching patterns in overall news consumption habits.\n\nPreferred pathways to local news\n\nFewer people now say they prefer to get local news through a television set (32%, down from 41% who said the same in 2018).\n\nset (32%, down from 41% who said the same in 2018).

Smaller shares prefer getting their local news from a print newspaper or on the radio (9% each).\n\nSpecific sources for local news\n\nThe types of sources (e.g., outlets or organizations) Americans are turning to are changing as well:\n\nWhile local television stations are still the most common source of local news beyond friends, family and neighbors, the share who often or sometimes get news there has declined from 70% to 64% in recent years.\n\nare still the most common source of local news beyond friends, family and neighbors, the share who often or sometimes get news there has declined from 70% to 64% in recent years.

This is on par with the percentage who get local news at least sometimes from local radio stations.\n\nsuch as groups or the app, have become a more common destination for local news: 52% of U.S. adults say they at least sometimes get local news from these types of forums, up 14 percentage points from 2018.

The share of Americans who get local news from newspapers is now roughly on par with the share who get local news from local government agencies (35%) or local newsletters or Listservs (31%).\n\nNot only are fewer Americans getting local news from newspapers, but local daily newspapers are now more likely to be accessed online than in print.\n\n31% of those who get news from daily newspapers do so via print, while far more (66%) do so digitally, whether through websites, apps, emails or social media posts that include content from the paper.\n\nIn 2018, just over half of those who got news from local daily newspapers (54%) did so from print, and 43% did so via a website, app, email or social media site.\n\nThere is a similar move toward digital access for local TV stations, though local TV news is still mostly consumed through a TV set.\n\nIn 2024, 62% of those getting news from local TV stations do so through a television, compared with 37% who do so through one of the digital pathways.\n\nAn even bigger majority of local TV news consumers (76%) got that news through a TV set in 2018.\n\nJump to more information on how people access local news.\n\nThe financial state of local news\n\nThe turmoil for the local news industry in recent years has come with major financial challenges. Circulation and advertising revenue for newspapers have seen sharp declines in the last decade, according to our analysis of industry data, and other researchers have documented that thousands of newspapers have stopped publishing in the last two decades. There also is evidence of audience decline for local TV news stations, although advertising revenue on local TV has been more stable.\n\nWhen asked about the financial state of the news outlets in their community, a majority of Americans (63%) say they think their local news outlets are doing very or somewhat well, with a third saying that they\u2019re not doing too well or not doing well at all. This is a slightly more pessimistic view than in 2018, when 71% said their local outlets were doing well, though it is still a relatively positive assessment of the financial state of the industry.\n\nJust 15% of Americans say they have paid or given money to any local news source in the past year \u2013 a number that has not changed much since 2018. The survey also asked Americans who did not pay for news in the past year the main reason why not. The most common explanation is that people don\u2019t pay because they can find plenty of free local news, although young adults are more inclined to say they just aren\u2019t interested enough in local news to pay for it.\n\nJump to more information on how people view the financial state of local news.\n\nOther key findings in this report\n\nAmericans get local news about a wide variety of topics. Two-thirds or more of U.S. adults at least sometimes get news about local weather, crime, government and politics, and traffic and transportation, while smaller shares (but still at least half) say they get local news about arts and culture, the economy, schools, and sports.\n\nRelatively few Americans are highly satisfied with the coverage they see of many topics. The survey also asked respondents who at least sometimes get each type of local news how satisfied they are with the news they get. With the exception of weather, fewer than half say they are extremely or very satisfied with the quality of the news they get about each topic. For example, about a quarter of those who consume news about their local economy (26%) say they are extremely or very satisfied with this news. Read more about different local news topics in Chapter 2.\n\nWhen asked whether local journalists should remain neutral on community issues or advocate for change in the community, a majority of Americans (69%) say journalists should remain neutral, reflecting more traditional journalistic norms. However, 29% say that local journalists should be advocating for change in their communities. Younger adults are the most likely to favor advocacy by journalists: 39% of those ages 18 to 29 say that local journalists should push for change, as do 34% of those 30 to 49. Read more about Americans\u2019 views of the role of local journalists in Chapter 4.\n\nAmericans who feel a strong sense of connection to their community are more likely to engage with local news, say that local news outlets are important to the community, and rate local media more highly overall. For example, 66% of those who say they are very attached to their community say local news outlets are extremely or very important to the well-being of their local community, compared with 46% of those who are somewhat attached and 31% of those who are not very or not at all attached to their community.",

Many Republican voters harbor deep doubts about whether President Joe Biden is fit for a second term . Trump said he may not accept the presidential election results this time, either .",
        "text": "As Trump airs his election doubts, many supporters say they won't accept a Biden win in 2024\nMore than six months out from the presidential election, many Republican voters harbor deep doubts not only about whether President Joe Biden is fit for a second term \u2014 but also about whether he can even win re-election fair and square.\n\n\u201cI think that the powers that be on the Democratic side have figured out a way to circumvent democracy,\u201d said Darlene Anastas, 69, of Middleborough, Massachusetts.\n\nPoll after poll has found that a large proportion of the Republican electorate believes the only reasons Joe Biden is president are voter fraud and Democratic dirty tricks, buying into former President Donald Trump\u2019s baseless claims about the 2020 election.\n\nTrump continues to stoke those fires on the campaign trail.\n\nHe frequently airs false claims about his 2020 election performance and has leaned into defending his supporters who rioted at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. In an interview with Time this week, he said he would have trouble hiring anyone who believes Biden legitimately won in 2020: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t feel good about it.\u201d\n\nAnd on Wednesday, Trump said he may not accept the presidential election results this time, either.\n\n\"If everything's honest, I'd gladly accept the results,\" Trump told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. \"If it's not, you have to fight for the right of the country.\"\n\nThe doubts Trump pushed last time around resulted in Jan. 6 and linger to this day. Now, there is a fresh cycle of skepticism, pushed again by Trump and many others in the Republican Party. And the views have firmly taken root with many of their followers, as interviews with 50 Republican voters across a dozen states showed.\n\nThe majority of voters who spoke with NBC News said they weren\u2019t prepared to accept a Biden victory as legitimate, potentially setting up another presidential election \u2014 and potentially a volatile aftermath \u2014 in which a large part of the public refuses to believe the results.\n\nTrump himself wouldn\u2019t dismiss the possibility of violence around the election in his interview with Time: \u201cIf we don\u2019t win, you know, it depends. It always depends on the fairness of the election.\u201d\n\nDemocrats \u201ccheat like crazy,\u201d said George Crosby, 72, a veteran from Fitzwilliam, New Hampshire. \u201cI think they cheated before, and I think they\u2019re going to try to do it again, because they\u2019re a bunch of communists.\u201d\n\nJames Russon, 38, of Eagle Mountain, Utah, said, \u201cThere\u2019s no way Biden could legally ... win without unfair means.\u201d He added that the only way Biden could prevail would be through \u201ccheating\u201d or \u201ca lot of deceased people voting.\u201d\n\nRandall Minicola, 62, of Las Vegas, said it would be \u201cimpossible\u201d for Biden to win.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s got a following. I mean, you look who\u2019s behind him \u2014 the only thing he\u2019s got is ghosts behind him. That\u2019s what I believe. Where\u2019s the supporters then? Are they in the basement with him? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Minicola said.\n\nThe possibility of another election in which large numbers of Republicans refuse to accept a Biden victory has also been stoked by influential conservatives.\n\n\u201cA senile man is not going to get elected in the most powerful country in the world unless there\u2019s fraud,\u201d former Fox News host Tucker Carlson said on the \u201cLex Fridman Podcast\u201d in March.\n\n\u201cWho would vote for a senile man?\u201d Carlson asked. \u201cHe literally can\u2019t talk.\u201d\n\nRepublican voters who said they don\u2019t believe Biden can win in 2024 frequently cited their doubts about the outcome in 2020 as a reason to be skeptical again. But they also had three other driving concerns: Biden\u2019s age and mental fitness, mistrust in the electoral process and information from social media.\n\n'A few bubbles off center'\n\nQuestions about Biden\u2019s mental and physical fitness for the job have consistently come up this election cycle. Biden, 81, would be the oldest president ever if he\u2019s re-elected. Trump, who is 77, would also be the oldest.\n\nThe latest NBC News national polling, conducted April 12-16, finds Americans with little confidence in Biden\u2019s mental and physical health. Only 26% of those surveyed picked Biden over Trump when they were asked which candidate has the necessary mental and physical health to be president. Forty-five percent went with Trump, and 26% responded that neither candidate is up to snuff.\n\nSome Republican voters\u2019 belief that Biden isn\u2019t up for the job mentally also convinces them there\u2019s no way he could pull off a win.\n\nAsked why she doesn\u2019t believe Biden can win without cheating this cycle, Martha O\u2019Hara, 64, of Parker, Colorado, said it was \u201cbecause of his inability to complete a sentence.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t think that he has the ability to do a debate effectively where you could understand the topic,\u201d she said. \u201cI just don\u2019t think that he\u2019s mentally able.\u201d\n\nCheryl Pulice, 61, of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, shared O\u2019Hara\u2019s sentiment.\n\n\u201cOh, no, no,\u201d Pulice said when she was asked whether Biden could win legitimately. \u201cCognitively, he\u2019s not well. I\u2019m surprised that he hasn\u2019t been made to step down at this point.\u201d\n\nNancy Glawe, 45, a hospital worker from Tucson, Arizona, said, \u201cThere\u2019s a few bubbles off center.\u201d She voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020 but is supporting Robert F. Kennedy Jr. this year.\n\nMistrust of voting machines\n\nIn the wake of the 2020 election, prominent conspiracy theorists and Trump\u2019s lawyers made outlandish claims about voting machines, arguing that the election was rigged by a global cabal of corporations and foreign communists. Trump\u2019s lawyers promised proof but offered none, which in part led to the failure of dozens of lawsuits seeking to overturn the outcome of the election.\n\nThe voting machine companies Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic, which were repeatedly accused of rigging the election, responded with a dozen defamation suits against Trump allies and conservative media outlets.\n\nFox News and Dominion Voting Systems reached a $787.5 million settlement agreement last year. The litigation made public emails showing that Trump lawyer Sidney Powell offered up an email from someone who identified as an \u201cinternally decapitated\u201d time traveler as evidence of Dominion\u2019s supposed election rigging.\n\nFox said in a statement at the time of the settlement that it recognized the court\u2019s previous ruling that certain claims it had made about Dominion were \u201cfalse.\u201d\n\nBut the unfounded theories linger, and some voters still aren\u2019t convinced.\n\n\u201cI have great concern, as well, for the machines, any electronic [machines],\u201d said Ellen Streiff, 57, of Glendale, Arizona. Streiff also plans to support Republican Kari Lake for the Senate; Lake has repeatedly spread false claims about voting machines in the wake of her failed 2022 bid for governor.\n\nKelly Hicks, 41, a Trump supporter from Litchfield, New Hampshire, said the embrace of voting machines is also what\u2019s driving her distrust in Biden\u2019s ability to win fair and square.\n\n\u201cWe see an increase in the machines being used that were used in our previous election,\u201d Hicks said. She added that she believes not enough has been reformed since 2020 to make 2024 a fair fight.\n\nThe U.S. has used voting machines for decades, and there\u2019s no evidence of any fraud schemes involving them \u2014 despite countless investigations and reviews by state and local authorities.\n\nMichael Granger, a state legislator from Milton, New Hampshire, also mentioned voting machines as the reason he\u2019s unsure whether this year\u2019s results will be legitimate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to prove one way or another without auditing all the votes,\u201d said Granger, 33, a state representative. \u201cAll the votes are counted across different municipalities. There\u2019s different procedures. Some places have machines; some places don\u2019t. It\u2019d be very hard to prove.\u201d\n\nVoting machines are used in the vast majority of U.S. elections \u2014 less than 0.2% of registered voters in the U.S. live in jurisdictions that will hand-count ballots this year. Pre-election accuracy testing and post-election audits are used to verify results. In Georgia, for example, voters cast ballots on machines, but post-election audits count the votes listed on paper ballots.\n\nSocial media bubbles\n\nAs Republicans and Democrats alike absorb their political information through personally targeted social media algorithms, voters acknowledged to NBC News that their disbelief that Biden can legitimately win might be spurred by the content they\u2019re being delivered on their phones.\n\nAsked why he doesn\u2019t believe Biden can win fairly, Davis Green, a financial analyst from Salt Lake City, said, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s the bubble I\u2019m in and the algorithm that I\u2019m seeing.\u201d\n\nGreen, 35, voted third party in 2016 and in 2020 but is supporting Trump this year.\n\nJoseph Murillo, 22, an air-conditioning technician from Las Vegas, also pointed to his social media feeds for why he\u2019s skeptical about Biden\u2019s 2020 win and any potential victory in November.\n\n\u201cMaybe because my social media stuff kind of tells me what I want to hear sometimes, you know, the algorithm,\u201d Murillo said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s a fair way that Biden could win.\u201d\n\n'Anything's possible'\n\nMichael Ferraro, 66, of Fairfax, Virginia, said voting by mail fueled his skepticism of the 2020 results.\n\n\u201cThe whole mail-in ballot thing in 2020 was confusing for not only citizens but for people counting the ballots,\u201d he said.\n\nYet Ferraro said his questions about the last election won\u2019t stop him from accepting the results this year, even if Trump doesn\u2019t win, because he feels better about what\u2019s being set up for November.\n\n\u201cI think there are more people watching on both sides,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt least where we live, I can tell there are a lot more people at polling places. ... People are going to be attentive,\u201d he added.\n\nPaul Gleske, 61, of Berwick, Maine, also thinks it\u2019s at least possible for Biden to win legitimately.\n\n\u201cIt seems like most people have already decided; there\u2019s a small sliver in the middle,\u201d Gleske said, predicting a tight race.\n\nDan Wilson, 69, a retired medical ethicist from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, who has supported Trump since 2016, said nothing could be ruled out.\n\n\u201cAnything\u2019s possible,\u201d he said.\n\nJanice Woerner, 51, a music teacher from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, thinks a legitimate Biden win could be in the cards. But she dreads the day that ever comes.\n\n\u201cIf he is legitimately elected by our country,\u201d Woerner said, \u201cthen heaven help us is all I have to say.\u201d",

Donald Trump\u2019s Black support is often clocking in at levels that would outpace those of all previous Republican nominees in the modern era .

        "text": "A generational divide splits Black voters ahead of Biden-Trump rematch\nOne of the more noticeable polling shifts between the last presidential campaign and this one is among Black voters.\n\nWhile they remain overwhelmingly aligned with President Joe Biden, his level of support is lower than in 2020. And Donald Trump\u2019s Black support is often clocking in at levels that would outpace those of all previous Republican nominees in the modern era.\n\nThe findings have produced understandable skepticism, fueled by red herring polls in past campaigns suggesting surprising levels of Black GOP support that failed to materialize on Election Day. Dating to the 1964 presidential race, no Republican presidential candidate has exceeded 12% Black support in exit polls, with most failing to reach double digits.\n\nBut if you average the results of every high-quality independent poll released since April 1, here\u2019s how Black voters are breaking \u2014 and how they were breaking over the same period in 2020:\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that in most individual polls, the sample sizes of Black voters are generally low, given that they typically make up just over 10% of the electorate. That translates to a considerable margin of error in any given poll. Nonetheless, the averages, which fold in subsample results from multiple polls, do suggest a change from four years ago.\n\nAnd that change appears to be generational. Breakdowns of Black voters by age are available from several recent polls; each shows a striking gap between younger and older Black voters:\n\nAgain, these reflect relatively small sample sizes, although the NBC News and CNN numbers are from \u201cmerged data\u201d \u2014 datasets that combine the Black voter subsamples from the two national polls that each organization has sponsored this year, doubling the sample of Black voters. The age splits here are consistent and striking.\n\nIn addition, a Washington Post/Ipsos poll released this week (but conducted a month ago) looked exclusively at Black voters, with a pool of over 1,000 and a much smaller margin of error. Unfortunately, the poll didn\u2019t directly measure the Biden/Trump race. But respondents were asked to rate their likelihood of supporting each of five potential candidates: 74% said Biden, 14% Trump, 20% Robert F. Kennedy Jr., 14% Jill Stein and 9% Cornel West.\n\nThose numbers add up to well over 100% because many respondents picked multiple candidates, making it hard to place the findings in context with other polls. But even here, the age divide is glaring:\n\nWhat\u2019s clear and consistent across polls is that younger Black voters are more disillusioned with Biden and more open to Trump and third-party alternatives, while older Black voters are far more supportive of Biden and resistant to other options. If Trump can actually translate that into a historically high level of Black support and deny Biden the kind of advantage Democrats have long enjoyed, it could win him the election.\n\nBut that\u2019s a huge \u201cif.\u201d The same polls also show that Biden-wary younger Black voters are far less likely to turn out in November than their older counterparts. In our NBC News poll, only 43% of Black respondents under 50 rated their interest level in the election as \u201c9\u201d or \u201c10\u201d on a 1-10 scale; among those over 50, 77% did.\n\nAnd if it\u2019s mainly the pro-Biden side of this generational divide that shows up in November, we could end up looking back at the current polling as just another red herring.",

        "text": "Georgia oversight panel ruminates on 2020 election hiccups as 2024 showdowns loom \u2022 Georgia Recorder\nThe Georgia Election Board voted Tuesday to reprimand Fulton County and appoint an independent monitor for the 2024 election for violating state law while conducting a recount of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nIn a 2-1 vote on the panel that oversees how counties conduct elections, members agreed to admonish Fulton County and order a monitor for this year\u2019s campaigns. That allows the county to avoid paying a fine or having the attorney general investigate the double-counting of 3,075 ballots and other allegations of irregularities during the 2020 presidential recount. Georgia election officials determined mistakes in 2020 by county election workers would not have changed the outcome.\n\nGeorgia Secretary of State investigators said they are unable to determine how many of the invalid ballots were included in the results used to certify the 2020 election. Democrat Joe Biden narrowly defeated GOP nominee Donald Trump by nearly 12,000 votes.\n\nState officials reported that there were 3,075 duplicate ballot images, but they were unable to determine how many of the ones cast were tabulated in the recount. The court case revolves around apparent discrepancies between the initial recount totals in November 2020 and the corrected totals released a day later by Fulton County.\n\nAccording to Fulton\u2019s initial results, Trump received 137,240 votes out of 524,659, while Biden received 381,144. Following a recount requested by Trump\u2019s lawyers, the final results led to the former president gaining seven additional votes and Biden losing 932.\n\nIn January 2021, Fulton officials acknowledged failures to properly back up data to servers during the recount. A Fulton election official told the state election officials that the discrepancy likely resulted from the mishandling of ballot batches and that changes have since been made to separate ballots once they\u2019re scanned.\n\nElection board member Ed Lindsey Jr. offered a motion Tuesday to reprimand Fulton and appoint an independent monitor who could be in place prior to the November general election.\n\nIf the state election and Fulton officials fail to agree on who to hire as the election monitor, he said, then he would recommend in July that the board ask the state attorney general to take the case.\n\n\u201cMy purpose here is not to let it ride but to move this matter forward so that we can have some assurance regarding the 2024 election,\u201d said Lindsey, a Republican and former lawmaker who was appointed to the state election board by the Georgia House of Representatives in January 2022.\n\nState Election Board member Janice Johnston, an appointee of the Georgia Republican Party, voted against the motion, citing the need for a more comprehensive examination of Fulton\u2019s election operations.\n\n\u201cWith over 140 violations of election laws and rules, it would be a travesty not to refer this to the Attorney General and let this ride,\u201d she said.\n\nCharlene McGowan, general counsel under Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, said that despite the recount discrepancies, the election results are still accurate after being counted three times. That includes the initial tally by the Dominion Voting Systems equipment, a full-hand count and another rescanning of ballots, which led to the dispute about the double counting of ballots.\n\n\u201cThe paper ballot is the record of the vote,\u201d McGowan said. \u201cIt is the most important document and it is what is used to tabulate the vote and to tabulate the results. As long as we have that paper ballot, we have the paper trail that accurately records the voter\u2019s choice.\u201d\n\nGeorgia\u2019s Secretary of State opened an investigation after a complaint was filed in July 2022 by Georgia resident Joseph Rossi and Kevin Moncla, a far-right Texas activist, alleging that Fulton County failed to correctly conduct a machine recount and other irregularities tied to the 2020 election.\n\nThe complaint also says that the county is missing more than 17,000 ballot images that were requested for inspection from the 2020 election.\n\nThe state Legislature passed a law requiring ballot images to be kept as public record after the 2020 election and state officials said that not having all of the ballot images from that year doesn\u2019t mean that the votes weren\u2019t correctly tabulated.\n\nMarilyn Marks, executive director of the Coalition for Good Governance, described Tuesday\u2019s board meeting as a forum for conflicting information provided by people with an ax to grind, officials with a reason to be defensive including the secretary of state and Fulton, as well as members of the Georgia election board.\n\nGood Governance is a lead plaintiff in a federal lawsuit contesting the security of Georgia\u2019s electronic voting machines due to cybersecurity threats.\n\n\u201cThe entire debate about the Rossi complaint concerning materially inaccurate Fulton 2020 audit tallies, and machine recount tallies, including thousands of double-counted votes made one thing crystal clear: the State Election Board is failing in its investigative duties by assigning the SOS office to investigate election code violations where the SOS office itself is accused of wrongdoing, as in this case,\u201d Marks said in a statement. \u201cThe Board\u2019s investigations must be conducted independent of interested parties, to provide objectivity and transparency.\u201d\n\nMarks said that the dispute about the 17,000 missing ballot images could be resolved after Gov. Brian Kemp on Tuesday signed an election bill allowing the public to inspect paper ballots.\n\n\u201cHowever, thanks to the legislation Gov. Kemp signed today, the truth about the 2020 count, likely still confirming Biden\u2019s win, will come out. Given that the public will be able to require a new scan of the ballots themselves, the SOS claims that they cannot determine whether ballots were double counted will be shown to be false, with many ballots for both candidates being double counted in the official machine recount. The ballots representing the 17,000+ final votes where the images cannot be located, can be examined now and their existence verified.\u201d\n\nAccording to state election investigators, Fulton might not have all of the ballot images, but each of the original paper ballots are under seal due to pending litigation\n\nIn 2023, the election board rejected a state takeover of Fulton ballot counting following a lengthy performance review after the tumultuous 2020 presidential election brought some unwanted national attention to Georgia\u2019s most populated county. The independent panel report did not find any proof of election workers engaging in intentional misconduct but noted Fulton elections new leadership role is now resolving past problems with managerial oversight, disorganization and mistakes in recounting ballots.",

Are We Heading Toward One?\nWhat is a constitutional crisis?\n\nWith Trump waiting in the wings, could we\n\nbe heading toward one? \u201cThis is one of those essentially contested concepts without a fixed definition,\u201d says Dan Urman, director of the law and public policy minor at Northeastern, who teaches courses on the Supreme Court. From the ongoing dispute at the southern border, to the prospect of a second Trump presidency, what is a constitutional crisis? AP Photo By Tom Williams\n\nFrom the dispute at the southern border between Texas officials and the Biden administration, to the prospect of a second Donald Trump presidency, the phrase constitutional crisis has found its way into many headlines lately.\n\nWhile modern crises pose dangers that are clearly defined, others are subject to interpretation, such as what is meant when reporters casually invoke the failure of the institutions of government to keep the wheels of democracy greased. Rolling Stone did so earlier this year, declaring with ominous certainty, in anticipation of Trump\u2019s clash with state and federal prosecutors: \u201cAmerica is facing its greatest constitutional crisis since the Civil War.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is one of those essentially contested concepts without a fixed definition,\u201d says Dan Urman, director of the law and public policy minor at Northeastern, who teaches courses on the Supreme Court.\n\nPolitical officials and commentators frequently warned of a constitutional crisis during the Trump years \u2014 first, in response to some of his policies; then throughout congressional impeachments hearings; and, finally, when the former president allegedly mounted a campaign to overturn the results of the 2020 election. The term has re-entered public discourse as Trump, who is the presumptive Republican nominee for president, faces a slew of state and federal charges.\n\nNortheastern legal experts say that, though real-world examples are often contested, the concept of a constitutional crisis generally describes a situation in which a political dispute cannot be resolved within the system of rules, norms and procedures that govern society.\n\n\u201cIn general, it relates to an inability of our governmental institutions to resolve problems in a legal or democratic way within the constitutional system,\u201d Urman says.\n\nNortheastern University Professor of Law Jeremy Paul, left, and Daniel Urman, director of hybrid and online programs and the law and public policy minor, talk constitutional crises. Photo by Alyssa Stone/Northeastern University and Matthew Modoono/Northeastern University\n\nTypes of crises\n\nThe U.S. Constitution is supposed to provide a framework for resolving disputes through doctrines such as the separation of powers. A constitutional crisis occurs when the system of \u201cchecks and balances\u201d breaks down without clear recourse, and the issue at hand then \u201cspills over,\u201d rendering the institutions incapable of resolving the dispute, Urman says. Scholars, pointing to events throughout history, have delineated several categories of constitutional crises.\n\nWhen President William Henry Harrison died just one month into his tenure in 1841, a constitutional crisis ensued over the exact procedure for installing his successor. It wasn\u2019t until 1967, with the ratification of the 25th Amendment, that a process was put in place to clarify what had previously been constitutionally ambiguous.\n\nConstitutional vagueness can lead to one kind of crisis. Another is when the Constitution offers solutions to a problem, but they can\u2019t be implemented because they are politically infeasible. This was the case during the 2000 presidential election, when a dispute over vote tallies in Florida was kicked up to the Supreme Court despite constitutional remedies. (While the authority to determine a winning candidate rests with the House of Representatives in the case of a dispute, scholars note that constitutional rules governing presidential elections still must be \u201cinterpreted and supplemented.\u201d)\n\nThe high court ultimately handed the presidency to George W. Bush, ending a possible crisis (scholars have debated whether Bush v. Gore constituted an actual constitutional crisis) that left a stain on the democratic process.\n\nNortheastern Global News, in your inbox. Sign up for NGN\u2019s daily newsletter for news, discovery and analysis from around the world.\n\nNear-crises\n\nThe beginnings of crises seemed to rear their head during the tumult of the 2010s, Urman says. Take U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell\u2019s refusal to hold a hearing for Merrick Garland, who then-President Barack Obama nominated to the Supreme Court in 2016 at the tail end of his presidency following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nWhile many scholars protested the move, saying that Garland was owed a hearing, Republican senators still effectively stonewalled the nomination, clearing the way for the appointment of Justice Neil Gorsuch when Trump took office.\n\nThe dispute, however, was not a crisis, according to Urman.\n\n\u201cMcConnell was playing constitutional hardball,\u201d he says. \u201cHe was allowed to do this even though norms and past practices suggested Garland deserved, at the very least, a Senate hearing.\u201d\n\nJeremy R. Paul, a professor of law and former dean of the Northeastern University School of Law, agrees.\n\n\u201cWhat made it not a crisis is precisely that Obama backed down,\u201d Paul says. \u201cMcConnell said he wasn\u2019t going to hold a hearing, and Obama went and jaw-boned about it, which is to say, he complained about it; he talked to the public about it; but he didn\u2019t say, \u2018Well, we\u2019re just going to seat him anyway.\u2019\u201d\n\nA constitutional crisis usually refers to a defined moment, Urman says. The Civil War \u2014 itself perhaps the founding constitutional crisis \u2014 is a notable example. President Andrew Jackson refusing to follow the Supreme Court ruling in Worcester v. Georgia in 1832, which recognized Cherokee sovereignty above Georgia state law, is another. \u201cThe president didn\u2019t abide by a Supreme Court ruling,\u201d Urman says, \u201ca clear crisis.\u201d\n\nWhen President Richard Nixon refused to hand over audio recordings of some of his phone conversations to the special prosecutor in the Watergate scandal, a constitutional crisis loomed. But after the Supreme Court ordered that Nixon do so, he complied. Crisis averted, Urman says.\n\n\u201cA president refusing to abide by court orders to comply with a subpoena would, in my view, be a constitutional crisis,\u201d Urman says. \u201cNixon complying is what kept it from becoming a crisis. All of the other branches will have weighed in.\u201d",

        "text": "The Myths and Truths of Noncitizen Voting in the United States\nArturo Castellanos Canales\n\nOn April 12, 2024, former President Donald Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) announced that House Republicans would soon introduce a bill to ban noncitizens[1] from voting in federal elections.\n\nThe truth, however, is that noncitizens have been barred from voting in federal elections since 1924. In addition, in 1996, Congress made noncitizen voting in federal elections a crime punishable by fines and imprisonment. Accordingly, this explainer aims to separate myth from fact, providing an overview of existing laws impacting voting by noncitizens to understand the issue better.\n\nThe natural first place to look for voting qualifications must be the U.S. Constitution, which, notably, does not forbid noncitizens from voting. It simply sets two rules regarding voting qualifications:\n\nState legislatures have the authority to determine the voting qualifications of the electorate;[2] and\n\nThe U.S. Constitution explicitly forbids state legislatures from restricting suffrage on account of religion,[3] ethnicity,[4] sex,[5] poll taxes,[6] and age.[7]\n\nWith the U.S. Constitution empowering state legislatures to determine the voting qualifications of the electorate, the historical evolution of state constitutions in defining the electorate is particularly significant. Most people will find it surprising that certain noncitizens were permitted to vote in federal, state, and local elections in 33 states between 1776 and 1924.[8] Granting the right to vote to noncitizens was a common incentive among U.S. territories and new states to attract workers and families to work and populate the lands.[9]\n\nHowever, exactly one century ago, in 1924, Missouri became the last state in the country to ban noncitizen voting in federal elections after amending its state constitution to bar the practice.[10]\n\nYet, decades later, the U.S. Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRAIRA), a sweeping federal immigration enforcement bill. While no states had permitted the practice in the previous 74 years, Section 611 of IIRAIRA went beyond the existing prohibitions to criminalize noncitizen voting in federal elections, making it a crime punishable by up to one year in prison.[11]\n\nThe law, however, explicitly left a door open for noncitizens to vote in state or local elections in accordance with state constitutions and local ordinances.[12] While no state constitutions allow noncitizens to vote in state elections, some municipalities do permit them to vote in local elections.\n\nIn 1992, the City of Takoma Park, Maryland, became the first municipality in the country to restore noncitizen voting in local elections. From a legal standpoint, Takoma Park argued that Maryland\u2019s constitution expressly delegates municipalities the power to determine suffrage qualifications for municipal elections in their city charters.[13] In addition, from a practical perspective, Takoma Park argued that citizenship was an irrelevant suffrage qualification when voting for local officials because they deal with local responsibilities, such as parks and recreation, arts programs, public transportation, garbage collection, water, and sewage, to name just a few.\n\nSince Takoma Park granted noncitizens the right to vote in local elections, a small handful of localities have followed its steps. Currently, eleven municipalities in Maryland[14] and Washington, D.C.[15], have opted to allow noncitizens to participate in municipal elections. In addition, at least two school districts in California[16] permit noncitizens to vote in school board elections (but not other municipal elections). In these jurisdictions, noncitizens remain ineligible to vote in federal and state elections.\n\nBesides these handfuls of localities, dozens of cities have considered granting noncitizen voting rights for municipal elections \u2013 including Los Angeles, New York City, and Portland \u2013 but all initiatives failed at the time of the article\u2019s publication.[17]\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Trump-Johnson proposal to ban noncitizen voting seeks to solve a problem that does not exist. Noncitizens have been barred from voting in federal elections in the United States for at least a century. And since 1996, noncitizen voting in federal elections has been a crime punishable with fines and imprisonment. While a handful of municipalities lawfully permit noncitizens to vote exclusively in local elections, those localities are the exception. Accordingly, introducing new legislation to ban noncitizen voting in federal elections is unnecessary.\n\n[1] This paper defines \u201cnoncitizens\u201d as persons lacking U.S. citizenship.

        "text": "Interest rates may stay high for longer. Here\u2019s what it means for the 2024 election.\nInterest rates may stay high for longer. Here\u2019s what it means for the 2024 election.\n\nAt the start of 2024, the economy appeared to deliver just about everything President Joe Biden could want: falling inflation, robust growth and a forecast of interest rate cuts at the Federal Reserve that might send economic output even higher.\n\nSince then, however, the sunny outlook has darkened. Inflation has proven stubborn and output has slowed. Perhaps most notably, the Fed has cast doubt over whether rate cuts will arrive after all.\n\nExperts who spoke to ABC News described the delay of interest rate cuts as a challenge for Biden that could make his reelection more difficult. The lack of cuts could weigh on economic output and compound the financial pain of inflation, they noted.\n\nMoreover, if the Fed did cut rates, any benefits would likely take hold beyond Election Day. Those benefits would also be muted since key measures of economic health remain fairly strong, such as the pace of economic expansion and the level of unemployment, experts argued.\n\n\"High interest rates tamp down economic growth and that is a detriment to the president\u2019s reelection,\" Matt Grossman, a professor of political science at Michigan State University who studies the role of economic performance in electoral politics, told ABC News.\n\n\"The only unknown there is the timeline,\" Grossman added, referring to delayed interest rate cuts. \u201cIt might be too late now to have a big effect on economic performance.\u201d\n\nWhen reached for comment, the Biden campaign directed ABC News to a former member of the Council of Economic Advisers.\n\nAt a meeting last week, the Fed decided to hold its benchmark interest rate steady for the sixth consecutive time. The central bank said it does not anticipate cutting interest rates until it's confident that inflation is moving sustainably downward.\n\n\"So far the data has not given us that greater confidence,\" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a press conference in Washington, D.C., last Wednesday. \"It is likely that gaining such greater confidence will take longer than previously expected.\"\n\nInflation has fallen significantly from a peak of 9.1% but it remains more than a percentage point higher than the Fed's target rate of 2%.\n\nSince last July, the Fed Funds rate has stood between 5.25% and 5.5%, matching its highest level in more than two decades.\n\nThe delayed interest rate cuts mark a blow to the Biden campaign, since the Fed\u2019s posture illustrates the need for a continued fight against inflation, Steve Boms, founder and president of D.C.-based consulting firm Allon Advocacy.\n\n\"If you\u2019re on the Biden campaign, you\u2019re hoping that the rate cuts come as soon as possible because voters tend to vote based on their pocketbooks,\" Boms said.\n\nInterest rate cuts would lower borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, potentially triggering a burst of economic activity through greater household spending and company investment.\n\nCredit card holders could gain some immediate relief from sky-high interest rates while prospective homebuyers would see mortgage rates ease. Even a series of two quarter-point cuts at the Fed, however, would not sizably reduce such borrowing costs, Boms said.\n\nStill, he added, the interest rate cuts would send an important signal that the administration has brought inflation under control.\n\n\"The headline of rates starting to come down could move the needle politically a little bit even if quantitatively it wouldn\u2019t make that much of an impact on how much folks are spending on credit cards, auto loans and mortgages,\" Boms said.\n\nThe economy poses a political liability for Biden. Thirty-seven percent of U.S. adults approve of Biden\u2019s handling of the economy, slightly lower than his overall approval rating of 40%, according to a Gallup poll in March.\n\nPublic sentiment about the economy has improved in recent months but it remains well below pre-pandemic levels, according to a University of Michigan survey.\n\nThat said, the economy has performed well on several key metrics. Economic growth has slowed in recent months but continues apace at a solid clip. Unemployment stands near a 50-year low.\n\nThe movement of interest rates prior to Election Day is unlikely to change economic factors that affect voter attitudes, such as the unemployment or growth rate, Joe Stone, a professor emeritus of economics of the University of Oregon, told ABC News.\n\n\"Most of the economic factors that would affect the election are already baked in this close to the election,\" Stone said.",

See Latest Voter Registration Data\nSpotlight PA is an independent, nonpartisan, and nonprofit newsroom producing investigative and public-service journalism that holds power to account and drives positive change in Pennsylvania. Sign up for our free newsletters.\n\nUpdate, Sept. 18: Democrats in Pa. approach 2024 election with slimmest voter registration advantage in decades\n\nHARRISBURG \u2014 For the first time in at least 16 years, the Democratic and Republican parties in Pennsylvania are within half a million registered voters of one another.\n\nSince 2008, Democrats\u2019 registration edge over Republicans has steadily shrunk \u2014 from a 12% advantage in April 2008 to about a 4% advantage in April 2024, according to a Spotlight PA analysis of Department of State data.\n\nThe number of people registered as independents or under a third party has also grown, from 11% of total registered voters in 2008 to 15% this year.\n\nPolitical consultants who spoke with Spotlight PA said that while registration trends can signal an electorate's moods, they can't tell you everything about how a closely divided state like Pennsylvania will vote.\n\nStephen Medvic, a government professor at Franklin & Marshall College, said 2010 was a high water mark for Democratic registration in recent Pennsylvania history and that there was \u201cnowhere to go but down\u201d from there in terms of registration numbers.\n\nThe party\u2019s relatively lower registration rate is \u201cnot good [for Democrats], but I\u2019m not sure it spells doom,\u201d said Medvic.\n\nBeyond that, consultants say Pennsylvania has undergone a political realignment in the last decade and a half. Anne Wakabayashi, a Democratic political consultant with public relations firm BerlinRosen, said registration is \u201ccatching up more with the behavior of the electorate.\u201d\n\nThat behavior, she said, includes working-class voters in Western Pennsylvania who have historically been part of labor unions changing their registration to Republican in recent years, coupled with an influx of highly educated and wealthy transplants establishing themselves in the suburbs of Philadelphia.\n\nSam Chen, a GOP political consultant based in the Lehigh Valley, pointed to the same dynamic and noted that it can be seen in the commonwealth\u2019s changing registration geography. Democrats used to dominate counties in the industrial and rural parts of the state, particularly in the southwest and northeast. Now those areas are redder, while Democrats have consolidated support in suburbs, particularly in the populous southeast.\n\n\u201cThe Republican Party has shifted away from traditional conservativism into a more populist version of it, which speaks to traditional Democratic values like made-in-America union labor,\u201d Chen said. \u201cOn the Democratic side, I think you see that shift away from traditional liberalism over to a little bit more of a progressivism.\u201d\n\nWakabayashi noted that registration doesn\u2019t always keep pace with quickly shifting political preferences.\n\nIn her experience, voters can be slow to change registration even as their political opinions change. Sometimes they vote across party lines, opt to split their ticket and vote for candidates in both parties, or just don\u2019t turn out to cast a ballot.\n\nFor example, despite a dwindling advantage in the party\u2019s number of registered voters in Pennsylvania, Democrats won top-of-ticket races for president in 2020, and U.S. Senate and governor in 2022.\n\nHowever, in the latter year, Republicans Stacey Garrity and Tim DeFoor won statewide races for state treasurer and auditor general \u2014 flipping those offices.\n\nPolitical consultants and academics also say the increase in independent and third-party voters is significant and could indicate a growing disdain for the major political parties and a wider apathy that results in low voter turnout, such as during the 2024 primary election.",

        "text": "I bought Trump\u2019s Bible \u2013 a blasphemous, sticky nightmare\nThere was a time, not so long ago, that Donald Trump did not seem to be very familiar with the Bible.\n\nWhen he first ran for the nomination of the very Christian Republican party, Trump was unable to name a single Bible verse. Early in his 2016 presidential campaign he referred to the Eucharist as a \u201clittle cracker\u201d. In a subsequent church visit, as he attempted to prove his religious credentials, he put cash in a plate that was meant to hold the communion.\n\nHow times have changed.\n\n\u201cAll Americans need a Bible in their home, and I have many. It\u2019s my favorite book,\u201d Trump declared in March, in a video posted on Truth Social. \u201cI\u2019m proud to endorse and encourage you to get this Bible. We must make America pray again.\u201d\n\nIn the video, Trump, who has a long history of endorsing and selling things, is clutching the God Bless the USA Bible \u2013 a \u201cpatriotic\u201d take on the holy text that Trump is now hawking for $59.99.\n\n\u201cI want to have a lot of people have it,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cYou have to have it for your heart and for your soul.\u201d\n\nWell, who am I to defy a one-term, twice-impeached, former president who is currently on trial over hush-money payments to a porn star. I bought it.\n\nBuying something from Donald Trump is fraught with danger. Trump is known for not following through on business agreements: in the run-up to the 2016 election, literally hundreds of people, including lawyers, carpenters and painters, came forward to accuse Trump of not paying them for their work.\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Adam Gabbatt/The Guardian\n\nHappily the Bible, which cost $83.37 after tax and shipping, eventually arrived. I eagerly tore open the packaging, held the bag upside down, and out plopped what is essentially a Christian nationalist\u2019s fantasy: a Bible that is all American flags and bald eagles, with founding documents and lyrics to a patriotic anthem slotted in alongside the holy text.\n\nThe front of the Bible has an embossed USA flag. In the back are glossy pages bearing some of America\u2019s most sacred documents: the Declaration of Independence; the Pledge of Allegiance; and the lyrics to Lee Greenwood\u2019s God Bless the USA, a song which is played on repeat at Trump\u2019s political rallies.\n\nThese pages are illustrated with the American flag and some of the country\u2019s best-regarded things: the bald eagle, yes, but also the Statue of Liberty, what appears to be a musket, and the Capitol building, which somewhat ironically was attacked by supporters of Trump three years ago.\n\nOne of the more intriguing questions in the FAQ section of the Trump Bible website asks: \u201cWhat if my Bible has sticky pages?\u201d\n\nMy Bible did indeed have sticky pages. But no bother: the FAQ guidance explains that sticky pages are a common problem with new Bibles, and directs the reader to \u201ca YouTube video that does a wonderful job of explaining how to break your new Bible in\u201d.\n\nThat video is six minutes long. It shows a man unboxing what is objectively a better-looking Bible than the God Bless the USA version, then flipping through the entire book, page by page. \u201cSeparating the pages is a somewhat tedious process,\u201d the man says.\n\nHe was right. The Trump Bible, which uses public domain text from the King James version, has 1,350 thin-to-the-point-of-translucent pages, and I wasn\u2019t about to go through the entire thing. But all the good stuff appears to be in here: there\u2019s Noah desperately bundling animals on to a big boat, Job having his life ruined because of what amounts to a wager between God and the devil, and the book of Leviticus \u2013 much of which is given over to the correct way to sacrifice animals. (For a bullock, sprinkle its blood round the altar and wash its innards before setting it on fire; if you\u2019re offering up a pigeon, be sure to wring off its head before plucking.)\n\nYou don\u2019t have to pay $59.99 for that kind of content. Search \u201cfree Bible\u201d online and there are hundreds of places that are literally giving it away. But this Trump-endorsed Bible represents something special to his supporters, said Kristin Du Mez, a professor at Calvin University whose research focuses on the intersection of gender, religion and politics.\n\n\u201cMy sense is, most people aren\u2019t buying this Bible to read it,\u201d Du Mez said. \u201cThey\u2019re buying the Bible to have it, and to participate in this kind of shared identity. To put $60 down to say: \u2018Yes, this is my guy and and I\u2019m committed to this, and this is my faith.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe shared identity is one of embracing the \u201cmyth of Christian America\u201d, Du Mez said: \u201cThe idea that America was founded as a distinctly Christian nation: a proto-conservative, white evangelical version of the country, which never really existed. It\u2019s that shared vision of a mythical past, and commitment to restoring some semblance of that kind of mythical order in the present.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Trump on Trial Free newsletter Stay up to date on all of Donald Trump\u2019s trials.

In fact, the former president\u2019s relationship with the religious right has now deepened to the extent that Trump is comfortable with comparing himself to their messiah.\n\nFurther cementing that bond goes some way towards explaining Trump\u2019s decision to promote the God Bless the USA Bible. But there\u2019s also the financial aspect.\n\nTrump owes more than $500m as a result of civil court convictions. He is facing 88 felony charges, in five different jurisdictions, and lawyers cost money (unless you don\u2019t pay them).\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Adam Gabbatt/The Guardian\n\nWhile the God Bless the USA Bible website says that the Bible is \u201cnot owned, managed or controlled by Donald J Trump\u201d, it adds that the venture \u201cuses Donald J Trump\u2019s name, likeness and image under paid license from CIC Ventures LLC\u201d.\n\nTrump, according to a financial disclosure report filed last year, is the manager, president, secretary and treasurer of CIC Ventures LLC.\n\nHappy days for Trump then. Although this Bible wheeze has not gone down well with everyone.\n\n\u201cBlasphemous\u201d and \u201cdisgusting\u201d, was the verdict of pastor Loran Livingston, a conservative evangelical who leads the Central church in North Carolina. A pastor in South Carolina said the Bible was a \u201ccommandment violation\u201d, while Raphael Warnock, the Democratic Georgia senator and a pastor himself, also wasn\u2019t happy.\n\n\u201cThe Bible does not need Donald Trump\u2019s endorsement,\u201d Warnock told CNN.\n\n\u201cAnd Jesus in the very last week of his life chased the money changers out of the temple, those who would take sacred things and use them as cheap relics to be sold in the marketplace.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear how many of these \u201ccheap relics\u201d have been sold. As of early May, God Bless the USA Bibles were still available for sale online \u2013 unlike the Trump-licensed sneakers that he was hawking earlier this year.\n\nAfter the failure of Trump Steaks, Trump Vodka, Trump Mortgage, Trump Magazine, various Trump casinos and the Trump board game, perhaps the former president has finally given his name to a winning product. At $59.99 a pop for what is, objectively, quite a poorly printed, rather sticky book, the God Bless the USA Bible looks like a fairly safe bet. Maybe those lawyers will get paid after all.",

        "text": "With 2024 presidential contest looming, Georgia governor signs new election changes into law\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Gov. Brian Kemp signed legislation Tuesday that makes additional changes to Georgia\u2019s election laws ahead of the 2024 presidential contest in the battleground state, including defining probable causes for removing voters from the rolls when their eligibility is challenged.\n\nRepublican activists \u2014 fueled by debunked theories of a stolen election \u2014 have challenged more than 100,000 voters in the state in recent years. The activists say they are rooting out duplicate records and removing voters who have moved out of state.\n\nThe bill Kemp signed into law \u2014 SB 189 \u2014 lists death, evidence of voting or registering in another jurisdiction, a tax exemption indicating a primary residence elsewhere, or a nonresidential address as probable causes for removing voters from the rolls. Most controversially, it says the National Change of Address list can be considered, though not exclusively.\n\nSupporters have said the probable cause definition would make the challenge process more difficult. Opponents have disputed that, saying the changes would enable more baseless attacks on voters that would overwhelm election administrators and disenfranchise legitimate voters. For example, people sometimes live at a place of business, which would be considered a nonresidential address. Officials with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger\u2019s office say there are more reliable types of information, such as driver\u2019s license data, to confirm a voter\u2019s eligibility.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nThe Georgia bill also allows challenges to be accepted and voters removed from the rolls up until 45 days before an election. That provision in part has prompted the threat of lawsuits from liberal groups because federal law says states and counties can\u2019t make systematic changes to voting rolls within 90 days of a federal election.\n\nThe measure also says homeless people must use the county voter registration office as their address instead of where they live. Opponents have said that could make it harder for homeless citizens to cast ballots because their registered polling place might be far away.\n\nFair Fight Action, a voting rights group founded by former Democratic Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, slammed the signing of SB 189, calling the measure a \u201cvoter suppression bill that emboldens right-wing activists in their efforts to kick Black and brown voters off the rolls.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy signing SB 189 to become law, Brian Kemp delivered a gift to MAGA election deniers,\u201d the group said in a statement.\n\nAndrea Young, executive director of the ACLU of Georgia, called the bill a \u201cstep back for voters\u2019 rights and voting access.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are committed to protecting Georgia voters and will see the governor in court,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nAn email to a spokesman for the governor\u2019s office, Garrison Douglas, was not immediately returned.\n\nThe bill also grants access to Georgia\u2019s ballot to any political party that has qualified for the presidential ballot in at least 20 states or territories. The change could bolster independent candidates such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whose campaign has spooked Democrats worried it could draw support away from President Joe Biden.\n\nOther changes in the bill include removing Raffensperger from his ex-officio spot on the State Election Board. Kemp and Republican lawmakers had previously removed Raffensperger from his voting position on the board.\n\nMany Republicans who believe debunked theories that former President Donald Trump was cheated out of Georgia\u2019s 16 electoral votes in 2020 view Raffensperger as a particular enemy because the Republican secretary of state has forcefully defended the election results showing Biden won.\n\nRaffensperger and some others had lobbied for Kemp, himself a former secretary of state, to veto the bill.\n\nThe bill, additionally, says that beginning July 1, 2026, the state can no longer use a kind of barcode called a QR code to count ballots created on the state ballot marking devices. That is how votes are counted now, but opponents say voters don\u2019t trust QR codes because they can\u2019t read them. Instead, the bill says ballots must be read using the text, or human-readable marks like filled-in bubbles, made by the machines.\n\nThe bill also requires counties to report the results of all absentee ballots by an hour after polls close. It also lets counties use paper ballots in elections in which fewer than 5,000 people are registered, though that change will not take effect until 2025.\n\nKemp on Tuesday vetoed a separate election bill that would ban political contributions by foreign nationals and impose additional registration requirements on agents of foreign principals. The governor noted that such donations are already prohibited by federal law, and he said some of the registration requirements were not intended by the bill\u2019s sponsor.",

        "text": "How DC became obsessed with a potential 2027 Chinese invasion of Taiwan\nThis is the first story of a two-part series. The second story is available here.\n\nAt a summit near San Francisco in November, the leaders of America and China turned to the biggest threat to their relationship.\n\nThe topic was Taiwan, which China\u2019s government considers part of its rightful territory and has threatened to take by force. When it came up, according to an American official who later spoke to the press, Chinese leader Xi Jinping grew exasperated \u2014 not at the risk of war, but at the timeline.\n\n\u201cXi basically said: \u2018Look, I hear all these reports in the United States [of] how we\u2019re planning for military action in 2027 or 2035,\u2019 \u201d the official said.\n\n\u201c \u2018There are no such plans,\u2019 \u201d Xi said in the official\u2019s telling. \u201c \u2018No one has talked to me about this.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThat first year, 2027, is a fixation in Washington. It has impacted the debate over China policy \u2014 a shift from the long term to the short term. It\u2019s also helped steer billions of dollars toward U.S. forces in the Pacific. And in the last several years, it\u2019s been a question mark hanging over the Biden administration\u2019s approach to the region.\n\nAccording to U.S. intelligence, Xi has told the Chinese military it needs to be ready to invade Taiwan by that year. But ready to invade is different than will invade; American officials stress the year isn\u2019t a deadline.\n\nDefense News spoke to sources in Congress, the Pentagon and Washington-based think tanks to understand what may be the most important, most misunderstood year in Sino-U.S. relations. The message was that 2027 has exposed a rift in Washington\u2019s China strategy. The U.S. is more focused on the country it calls its \u201cpacing challenge,\u201d but experts disagree on whether it\u2019s running a sprint or a marathon \u2014 and if it can prepare for both.\n\nChina \u201cwill not renounce the use of force as a possibility\u201d around Taiwan, said David Finkelstein, who studies the Chinese military at the Center for Naval Analyses. \u201cSo the military option hangs over the Taiwan Strait like Damocles\u2019 sword.\u201d\n\nThe Davidson window\n\nIn the years leading up to 2021, Sino-U.S. relations had soured. Washington had become more confrontational during Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, in large part as a response to Beijing\u2019s own aggression. The People\u2019s Liberation Army was \u2014 and still is \u2014 bulking up quickly, with weapons, reforms and exercises that could enable an invasion of Taiwan. Lawmakers concerned the U.S. was falling behind had just created the Pacific Deterrence Initiative, an effort to rush more money to military leaders in the region.\n\nWith that backdrop, Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, began his questioning at a 2021 hearing.\n\n\u201cThe common theme I hear with regard to China\u2019s actions under Xi Jinping\u2019s leadership is alarm,\u201d Sullivan said, citing concerns over Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China\u2019s strong-arming of U.S. allies like Australia and India.\n\nSullivan then asked the sole witness that day \u2014 Adm. Phil Davidson, the retiring head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command \u2014 whether that changed the odds of a conflict around Taiwan.\n\n\u201cThe threat is manifest during this decade,\u201d Davidson said at the end of his answer, \u201cin fact, in the next six years.\u201d\n\nAdm. Phil Davidson, the head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command at the time, tours a memorial on Sept. 12, 2019, while visiting with Philippine military members. (MC1 Robin W. Peak/U.S. Navy)\n\nIt\u2019s rare to find a true before-and-after moment on an issue as complex as Sino-U.S. relations. This, said several experts, was one.\n\n\u201cIt set off these warning alarms that broke outside the niche community and into the broader policy conversation in D.C.,\u201d said a Republican congressional aide, granted anonymity because the individual was not authorized to talk to the press.\n\nThe concern it generated earned a nickname: the \u201cDavidson window,\u201d shorthand for the near-term threat of an attack on Taiwan.\n\nAnd that changed how Congress spent money. The Pacific Deterrence Initiative doesn\u2019t have its own budget, but in the last few years the U.S. has spent more on its forces in the region. Indo-Pacific Command sends Congress a yearly list of priorities, including what doesn\u2019t make the Pentagon\u2019s budget request.\n\nThe latest wish list has called for $26.5 billion in spending. And while $11 billion didn\u2019t make the cut in the Pentagon\u2019s fiscal 2025 budget request, that means about $15 billion did, with the chance lawmakers may add more in the next spending bill.\n\nCongress also gave the Pentagon $1 billion in annual authority to send Taiwan weapons. The recently passed national security supplemental includes almost $2 billion to replace whatever the Pentagon sends, along with $2 billion more in financing to purchase American equipment.\n\n\u201cYou can draw a direct line between Adm. Davidson\u2019s comments and the ability to get something like the foreign military financing for Taiwan through,\u201d the congressional staffer said.\n\nSuddenly, in a considerable number of hearings, members of Congress were asking military leaders about their windows.\n\nAt the start of the summer, the chief of naval operations and the commandant of the Marine Corps said they shared Davidson\u2019s concerns.\n\nGen. Mark Milley, then-chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a later hearing that Davidson\u2019s comments were based on a speech from Xi, calling on China\u2019s military to \u201cdevelop capabilities to seize Taiwan and move it from 2035 to 2027.\u201d\n\nU.S. officials haven\u2019t shared the text of that speech.\n\n\u2018I hope I am wrong\u2019\n\nThis became the standard line across the administration \u2014 affirmed by Central Intelligence Agency Director Bill Burns.\n\n\u201cPresident Xi has instructed the PLA [People\u2019s Liberation Army], the Chinese military leadership to be ready by 2027 to invade Taiwan. But that doesn\u2019t mean that he\u2019s decided to invade in 2027 or any other year as well,\u201d Burns said during a TV interview in February 2023.\n\nAmphibious assault vehicles of the Chinese People's Liberation Army move in formation at sea during a live-fire training exercise held in 2023. (Xie Wenjian/Chinese Defense Ministry)\n\nAnd as the hearing with Milley showed, that distinction is easy to miss. Then-Rep. Elaine Luria, D-Va., argued with the general over whether other witnesses had said China would invade by 2027.\n\nMilley said no, but added a caveat: \u201cIntent is something that can change quickly.\u201d\n\nThe back-and-forth showed two factors that have defined the 2027 debate ever since: For one, it\u2019s hard to keep the year from looking like a timeline; and second, even though ability and intent are different, they\u2019re still related.\n\nThe first issue has been clear in the three years since Davidson testified. More officials were pressed to offer their own assessments.\n\nIn fall 2022, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said China wants to unify with Taiwan on a \u201cmuch faster timeline\u201d than the U.S. expected. Then-Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Mike Gilday soon after said his service needed a \u201cfight tonight\u201d approach to the region.\n\nThen in early 2023, a memo from Gen. Mike Minihan, head of Air Mobility Command, leaked.\n\n\u201cI hope I am wrong,\u201d it read. \u201cMy gut tells me we will fight [China] in 2025.\u201d\n\nAfter this last case, the Pentagon intervened. Officials began repeating a new talking point: Conflict with China is \u201cneither imminent nor inevitable.\u201d They\u2019ve stuck to that assessment ever since.\n\nBut by then, said a senior defense official, granted anonymity to speak freely, the concerns around 2027 had spread widely.\n\nPeople around Washington would call the official\u2019s office to ask if China would invade that year and whether the U.S. is ready. Since then, the official said, the misconception has become less common.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like Xi Jinping has a calendar up in his office with a date in 2027 marked \u2018invade Taiwan,\u2019 \u201d the official said.\n\nIn fact, many of the experts who spoke with Defense News said it\u2019s unlikely any Chinese leader would set a deadline. Chinese law doesn\u2019t have timelines for an attack on Taiwan; it has conditions, particularly an attempt by the island to declare independence.\n\nAnd Xi hasn\u2019t scrapped China\u2019s policy toward the island, which calls for unification without war. Some leading China analysts don\u2019t think invading the island is a legacy issue for him.\n\n\u201cXi is a politician,\u201d said Toshi Yoshihara, who studies the Chinese military at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments think tank. \u201cAll politicians want options, so the last thing you want is to be tied to a deadline.\u201d\n\n\u2018Seed corn\u2019\n\nThe Pentagon doesn\u2019t dismiss 2027 altogether. That\u2019s because it\u2019s a real goal for China\u2019s military \u2014 just a nuanced one.\n\nChina\u2019s government has set a series of year-based goals throughout this century, almost like mile times a runner wants to hit while training to win a race.\n\nThe most important one is 2049, which is 100 years after the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China. By then, China\u2019s leaders want to reach \u201cnational rejuvenation\u201d \u2014 or as they see it, again becoming the world\u2019s most powerful country. A core part of that goal is unification with Taiwan.\n\nMembers of the media look at the Taiwanese developed large UAV Teng Yun, which resembles the American MQ-9 Reaper and can stay aloft for up to 24 hours, at the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology in Taichung in central Taiwan on Nov. 15, 2022. (Walid Berrazeg/AP)\n\nChina has also set short- and medium-term markers. The earlier one is 2027, the 100th anniversary of the People\u2019s Liberation Army. It was added to China\u2019s calendar in 2020. The midterm one is 2035.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a yardstick,\u201d said Chad Sbragia, a researcher at the Institute for Defense Analyses and former head of the Pentagon\u2019s China policy.\n\nThe logic isn\u2019t so different from how the U.S. works. Take an initiative like Replicator, for example. Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks has pledged to field thousands of drones by August 2025, which forces the Pentagon to move faster and offers a chance for accountability.\n\nChina\u2019s military goals aren\u2019t that specific. Instead, they\u2019re captured in somewhat vague phrases repeated by Chinese officials. By 2035, the modernization of its armed forces should be \u201cbasically complete.\u201d By 2049, it wants to have a \u201cworld-class\u201d military.\n\nThe official said it\u2019s not totally clear \u2014 to both the American and Chinese governments \u2014 what those phrases mean.\n\nThe goals for 2027 are more detailed, though hard to translate from the original Chinese. Here\u2019s how it\u2019s described in the Pentagon\u2019s 2023 report on China\u2019s military strength:\n\n\u201c\u2018Accelerate the integrated development of mechanization, informatization, and intelligentization,\u2019 while boosting the speed of modernization in military theories, organizations, personnel, and weapons and equipment.\u201d\n\nThe aims are simpler than they sound, the defense official said.\n\nTwo Taiwanese Kuang Hua VI-class missile boats maneuver at sea during a military drill on Jan. 31, 2024. (Annabelle Chih/Getty Images)\n\nThe first half focuses on the military\u2019s equipment, its ability to gather data, and its ability to communicate or jam its enemies. The second part refers to doctrine \u2014 or the ability for all the different parts of the People\u2019s Liberation Army to fight together.\n\nThese are the main areas where China thinks its military must improve if the nation is to surpass its rivals, most of all the United States. Others include corruption and the long time since China last fought a war, which means its leaders have less data on how their forces could perform today.\n\nThese goals all matter for a potential fight with Taiwan, though the official stressed that any conflict is still just that \u2014 potential. China\u2019s government would prefer to annex the island without a war, and may think a stronger military could force Taiwan into negotiations. The defense official said it\u2019s difficult to judge whether China is on pace to reach its goals, which are more difficult to measure than simply a weapons inventory.\n\n\u201cThe amount of military equipment they\u2019re producing is eye-watering,\u201d Sbragia said.\n\nIn response, some people, like U.S. military leaders in the Pacific and hawkish lawmakers, say America needs to surge money to its forces in the region. American law doesn\u2019t require the nation to defend Taiwan, but U.S. President Joe Biden has said several times that it would.\n\nOthers, such as officials in the Biden administration, argue the U.S. can\u2019t fixate on a threat this decade.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really get to choose one or the other,\u201d the defense official said. \u201cWe don\u2019t get to say we\u2019re going to pour all of our resources into being ready right now and shortchange what we think we need to invest in for the future.\u201d\n\nNot everyone agrees the U.S. can do both. Even those that do \u2014 such as former Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., who until recently led the House\u2019s committee focused on competition with China \u2014 argue the U.S. should be spending much more on the effort.\n\nBut China will likely be a long-term competitor \u2014 as illustrated by its goals, which stretch decades into the future. One of the benefits of the 2027 debate in Washington, multiple China experts told Defense News, is that it\u2019s made America\u2019s government take that competition more seriously.\n\nBut they also gave a warning: America shouldn\u2019t think there\u2019s zero chance of conflict before that year, and if nothing happens after that date, it shouldn\u2019t get complacent.\n\nThat means spending the money it can on the short-term threat while also upgrading U.S. forces for the long term, said Zack Cooper, who studies U.S.-China strategic competition at the American Enterprise Institute think tank.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be eating our seed corn,\u201d he said.\n\nThis is the first story of a two-part series. The second story is available here.\n\nNoah Robertson is the Pentagon reporter at Defense News. He previously covered national security for the Christian Science Monitor.

        "text": "Meet Allan Lichtman, the professor who predicted the president (and the last 9)\nAllan Lichtman, a professor of history at American University in Washington, D.C, has correctly predicted the outcome of nine out of the 10 most recent presidential elections since Ronald Reagan's re-election in 1984.\n\nSo how does he do it? With a crystal ball? Tarot readings? Ayahuasca retreats in the desert? No, he does it with science. Specifically, by applying the science of plate tectonics to American history and politics.\n\nLichtman developed the metrics for his predictions with the help of an earthquake specialist from Moscow in 1981 and uses 13 historical factors or \u201ckeys\u201d to determine presidential races\u2014four of those factors are based on politics, seven on performance, and two on the candidate\u2019s personality. The incumbent party would need to lose six of those factors, or \u201ckeys,\u201d to lose the White House.\n\nIn a recent phone interview with USA Today, Lichtman shared how he developed his method and what his thoughts are on the 2024 presidential race between the two party's presumptive nominees: President Joe Biden, and former President Donald Trump.\n\nHow did you become interested in presidential politics?\n\nI grew up in a very political family and we\u2019d always discuss politics at the dinner table. In 1960, when I was 13 years old, I got to go to a John F. Kennedy rally in New York City and was utterly inspired. He just blew us young people away, and since then, I have followed up on my interest in politics.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nMore:Professor Allan Lichtman's 2024 presidential pick\n\nHow did your knack for predicting presidential elections develop?\n\nLike so many other good ideas, I came across the keys serendipitously when I was a visiting distinguished scholar at the California Institute of Technology in southern California in 1981.\n\nThere I met the world\u2019s leading authority on earthquake prediction, Vladimir Keilis-Borok, the head of the Institute of Pattern Recognition and Earthquake Prediction in Moscow and it was his idea to collaborate. Get this: In 1963 he was a member of the Soviet Scientific Delegation that came to Washington D.C. under JFK and negotiated the most important treaty by far in the history of the world: the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.\n\nKeilis-Borok said, \u201cIn Washington, I fell in love with politics and always wanted to use the methods of earthquake prediction to predict elections.\u201d But, he said, \u201cI live in the Soviet Union \u2013 elections? Forget it. It\u2019s the supreme leader or off with your head. But you, you\u2019re an expert in American history and politics, together we can solve the problem.\u201d\n\nSo, we became \"The Odd Couple\" of political research and we re-conceptualized presidential elections in earthquake terms: As stability \u2013 the party holding the White House keeps the White House, and earthquake \u2013 the party is turned out.\n\nWith that in mind, we looked at every American presidential election from the horse-and-buggy days of politics, the election of Lincoln in 1860 to the election of Reagan in 1980, using Keilis-Borok\u2019s mathematical method of pattern recognition.\n\nIt was that retrospective investigation that led to the \"13 Keys to the White House\": simple true-false questions that probe whether or not there\u2019s going to be stability or earthquake, and our six-key decision rule, or the six keys that go against the White House party.\n\nWhat did we see in 2020?\n\nVery interesting election, where I did correctly predict Trump would lose and Biden would win.\n\nIn 2019, Trump was only down four keys. Remember, it takes six keys to count out the White House party. I hadn\u2019t made a prediction yet, but things were looking pretty good. Then the pandemic hit.\n\nWhen I predicted Trump\u2019s victory in 2016 \u2013 which you can imagine did not make me very popular in 90% Democratic Washington D.C. where I teach \u2013 Trump actually sent me a note on the Washington Post article where I predicted his win that said, \u201cCongrats Professor, good call.\u201d\n\nHe appreciated my call but he didn\u2019t understand the meaning of the keys. The keys primarily probe the strength and performance of the White House party.\n\nThe big message: It is governance, not campaigning, that counts. Trump didn\u2019t understand that. So when the pandemic hit, instead of dealing substantively with the pandemic like the keys would have indicated, he tried to talk his way out of it. Of course, it didn\u2019t work; the economy tanked, and he lost two additional keys: The short- and long-term economy. That put him down six keys, enough to predict his defeat.\n\nYou don\u2019t plan to unveil your 2024 prediction until around August, but what are you thinking and seeing now?\n\nForget the polls, forget the pundits.\n\nPolls six months, five months, even closer to the election have zero predictive value.\n\nForget all of the pundits who have said Biden\u2019s too old. Democrat\u2019s only chance to win is with Biden running for re-election. One of my keys is incumbency, he obviously wins that. Another key is party contest, he\u2019s not been contested. That\u2019s two keys off the top that Biden wins. That means six keys out of the remaining 11 would have to fall to predict his defeat.\n\nI\u2019ve also said while I have no final prediction, a lot would have to go wrong for Biden to lose.\n\nAre there any upsets on the horizon that we should keep an eye out for?\n\nRight now, Biden is only down, for sure, two keys: The mandate key, because the Democrats lost seats in the House 2022 elections; and the incumbent charisma key because Biden is no JFK. But there are four very shaky keys:\n\nThird-party: Now, to win the third-party key, the third-party candidate has to get at least 5% of the popular vote. Very few have gotten that. There has to be a stabilization of the vote for the third-party candidate as we get closer to the election, and right now, RFK Jr. is all over the map. I\u2019ve seen him as low as 3% and as high as 15%. That key is shaky but uncertain.\n\nSocial unrest: I thought it was pretty well locked in, in favor of the incumbent but the campus protests made it shaky.\n\nAnd of course, the two foreign policy keys: Success and failure \u2013 both shaky, given that we have two very uncertain wars raging in the Middle East and in Ukraine.\n\nBiden would have to lose all four of those or some other unexpected event like a sudden recession, to lose.",

        "summary": " Donald Trump and Joe Biden face off against each other for the first time in modern age . John Sutter: Voters don\u2019t have to imagine what either presidency is going to look like . Sutter asks: What\u2019s the best way to get undecided voters off the fence?",
        "text": "Chuck Todd: The missing ingredient to win the 2024 election \u2014 a mea culpa\nFor as long as I\u2019ve covered politics, the \u201chold your nose and vote\u201d trope has been a staple in the zeitgeist.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s the \u201clesser of two evils\u201d or the \u201cleast of the two bad options,\u201d but the point is the same. \u201cSouth Park\u201d put its own twist on this \u201cchoice\u201d in October 2004, when it depicted its coincidentally timed \u201cschool mascot election\u201d as a choice between a \u201cgiant douche\u201d and a \u201cturd sandwich,\u201d complete with a lecture at the end about the importance of voting even if the choice is between two very unappetizing options.\n\nWhich, of course, brings me to our always uplifting and joyful campaign between Donald Trump and Joe Biden \u2014 our third-ever campaign between two presidents and the first in the modern age. Unlike most elections, voters don\u2019t have to imagine what either presidency is going to look like \u2014 they already have that picture. It\u2019s the ultimate choice election, and whatever the outcome, voters can\u2019t say they weren\u2019t warned.\n\nBut the uncomfortable truth about this choice election is that the last slice of people deciding which way to vote don\u2019t love their options. Will they hold their noses and vote for one of the presidents? Will they decide to stay home? Will they simply vote third-party or skip the presidential race altogether on their ballots?\n\nAs I\u2019ve noted previously, this election is going to be decided by two kinds of \u201cswing\u201d voters: the independents truly vacillating between Biden and Trump and the disaffected partisans deciding whether to vote or not.\n\nObviously, if I knew how voters were likely to answer those questions, I\u2019d be moving to the U.K. and legally betting on the outcome!\n\nThe question I\u2019ve been pondering \u2014 and what many a strategist in both the Trump and the Biden camps is trying to figure out \u2014 is what these last undecided voters need to hear. What\u2019s the best way to get them off the fence, whether it\u2019s the Biden-or-Trump fence or the \u201cdo I bother to vote\u201d fence?\n\nBoth campaigns are having an easier time trying to message to the disaffected partisans. Essentially, both parties are trying to lure their disaffected partisans back to the fold by scaring them off the other side with cheap \u201cguilt by association\u201d tactics \u2014 think \u201cSoros-funded progressives\u201d or \u201cMAGA conservatives.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s team also believes the issue of abortion is a way to get voters who aren\u2019t thrilled with Biden to show up on his behalf, especially younger voters. Trump\u2019s folks believe the border and the economy should be enough to get those Nikki Haley Republicans and others in the GOP who don\u2019t like Trump\u2019s character to hold their noses and \u201ccome home.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s a final chunk of voters who I think are looking for one or both of the candidates to do something else: admit some failure in their tenures and express regret for decisions they did or didn\u2019t make. Ultimately, voters want to know the candidates they support are actually listening and responding to their concerns, even if those concerns change.\n\nWe\u2019ve had presidents who acknowledged voter disappointment following rebukes at the polls (usually in midterms). Bill Clinton did it after the 1994 elections. Two years later, he set up his re-election campaign when he used his State of the Union address to declare, \u201cThe era of big government is over.\u201d It was his way of virtue-signaling to the middle that he\u2019d back off trying to tackle health care or another big-government idea. Clinton would eventually clean up with the middle-of-the-road voter by 1996.\n\nBarack Obama called the 2010 midterm results a \u201cshellacking\u201d and curtailed his ambitions beyond health care after those elections, most prominently stopping his drive for a cap-and-trade law to curtail carbon emissions.\n\nEven George W. Bush made a gesture responding to the voter rebuke over Iraq in the 2006 midterms by firing Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and bringing in Bob Gates.\n\nSo what mea culpas do these current presidents facing off against each other owe the voters?\n\nI\u2019m sure many of you have a fairly long list, especially for the candidate you dislike the most. I\u2019d argue there\u2019s plenty for both presidents to acknowledge they didn\u2019t get quite right. The question is this: Is either candidate capable of admitting failure or showing that kind of humility?\n\nWhen it comes to a major failure for both candidates, there\u2019s one obvious place to start: their inability to bring the country together. I believe it\u2019s that fact that has kept either gentleman from taking anything more than a margin-of-error lead in the polls.\n\nThe most common refrain from the \u201cdouble hater\u201d voters I\u2019ve talked to is exhaustion from the political divide. If either candidate could somehow conjure an elixir to ease that feeling, it would go a long way for some of these voters.\n\nRight now, it\u2019s hard to argue with voters who think the country won\u2019t be in much of a better place regardless of who wins. There\u2019s a doom and gloom feeling among these voters that is palpable.\n\nNow, Donald Trump and mea culpas aren\u2019t something that go together like peanut butter and jelly. Peanut butter and tuna fish, maybe.\n\nIn fact, most presidents don\u2019t like to admit they were wrong \u2014 as my colleagues and I joke, presidents always seem to have \u201ccommunication challenges\u201d when their poll numbers go down. Rarely do presidents want to admit an idea itself is bad. Most presidents are supremely confident in their ability to persuade, which is why they have an easier time admitting communication failures than actual policy mistakes.\n\nThere is also this idea running through the minds of many political strategists that admitting failure shows weakness and weakness erodes confidence over time. That\u2019s what Trump would tell you: Never say you\u2019re sorry. Never admit a mistake. Find somebody else to blame.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the campaign or the candidacy that Joe Biden presented the country in 2019 and 2020. I can\u2019t help but wonder whether some of Biden\u2019s problems with this part of the electorate stem from his failure to fulfill the lofty promise he made on the first day of his presidency. In his inaugural address, days after the Jan. 6 riot, Biden said:\n\n\u201cToday, on this January day, my whole soul is in this: Bringing America together. Uniting our people. And uniting our nation. I ask every American to join me in this cause. Uniting to fight the common foes we face: anger, resentment, hatred. Extremism, lawlessness, violence. Disease, joblessness, hopelessness. With unity we can do great things. Important things.\u201d\n\nThe above paragraph is something perhaps any new president would say and want to believe. But Biden took his promise a step further in this speech:\n\n\u201cI know speaking of unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy. I know the forces that divide us are deep and they are real. But I also know they are not new. Our history has been a constant struggle between the American ideal that we are all created equal and the harsh, ugly reality that racism, nativism, fear and demonization have long torn us apart. The battle is perennial. Victory is never assured.\n\n\u201cThrough the Civil War, the Great Depression, world war, 9/11, through struggle, sacrifice and setbacks, our \u2018better angels\u2019 have always prevailed. In each of these moments, enough of us came together to carry all of us forward. And we can do so now. History, faith and reason show the way, the way of unity. We can see each other not as adversaries but as neighbors. We can treat each other with dignity and respect. We can join forces, stop the shouting and lower the temperature.\n\n\u201cFor without unity, there is no peace, only bitterness and fury. No progress, only exhausting outrage. No nation, only a state of chaos. This is our historic moment of crisis and challenge, and unity is the path forward. And we must meet this moment as the United States of America.\u201d\n\nNearly four years later, I\u2019m not sure many Americans would agree that we\u2019ve made much progress or that we\u2019ve gotten less exhausting outrage. We aren\u2019t any more unified \u2014 if anything, the country feels just as divided, and both parties seem more divided than ever, as well. One of the reasons over 70% of the country believes we are on the wrong track is a lack of faith in our ability to come together or, more specifically, our political leaders\u2019 ability to go the extra mile to bring us together.\n\nPresidents have to go 80% of the way on unity, whether that\u2019s fair or not. Hoping to meet the party out of power \u201chalfway\u201d is a tad naive. Many folks don\u2019t believe the other side (whichever that is for them) is serious about unity beyond looking like it is.\n\nI\u2019m not convinced Biden is going to do a mea culpa for his inability to bring the country together or his inability to turn the page on Trump, even though I think that was the central premise of his campaign, at least for the last slice of voters who put him over the top.\n\nI have no doubt that the people around the president and Biden himself believe he was prevented from bringing the country together by elements outside his control, including media fragmentation, partisans in the GOP, and the \u201cstolen election\u201d narrative pushed by Trump and amplified by forces outside our borders who are intentionally trying to divide us. And there\u2019s some part of that that rings true.\n\nAnd I\u2019m not sitting here saying he needs to find someone or some entity on the left to throw under the bus. But he has to be honest about his inability to fulfill the promise of his inaugural address.\n\nWhat\u2019s his plan to bring the country together in a second term? What\u2019s his plan to heal the soul of the nation? How does he introduce tolerance of differing political opinions to some in his own party who don\u2019t like what they hear from the populist right?\n\nThere\u2019s a growing perception among many centrists in the Democratic Party \u2014 and perhaps among some Nikki Haley Republicans, as well \u2014 that Biden doesn\u2019t speak out more as a centrist-sounding president for fear of alienating his base. It\u2019s similar to an argument some in Trump\u2019s orbit make about his trying to placate the centrists in the GOP.\n\nTrump is an insurgent leader, and insurgents can\u2019t lead their troops successfully if they compromise too much and alienate them.\n\nIn the last days before the 2016 election, Trump did do a form of mea culpa. He finally acknowledged Obama was born in the U.S. Of course, when you watch the video of Trump doing this rare mea culpa, it has all the trappings of a hostage tape.\n\nBut it was an important moment at the end of the campaign. His advisers convinced Trump he needed to show some humility about something, and the birther issue was an obvious place to start. Ironically, I doubt 2024 Trump would do what 2016 Trump did on the birther business, given how much he has clung to his stolen election fantasy. But the point is that it may have worked for him in 2016. Voters who didn\u2019t like Hillary Clinton were looking for some hope to hang on to with Trump, and that tiny mea culpa might have been it.\n\nAnd that brings me back to Biden and his current polling predicament. Compared to the last two Democratic presidents who won re-election, he has yet to have his mea culpa or public humble pie moment.\n\nHe was basically rebuked in the midterms, if you look at the exit poll of voters asked about the job he was doing. But because Biden\u2019s party did so much better than expected, the White House ditched any \u201cwe hear you\u201d messaging in favor of a \u201cwe had the most successful first midterm for a Democratic incumbent in decades\u201d narrative.\n\nIn hindsight, I\u2019m not sure that should have been the choice. Biden\u2019s Democratic Party overperformed in 2022 despite reservations about his leadership, not because of it. And now, Biden hasn\u2019t yet had a moment when he has been able to acknowledge to the public that he has heard the disappointment from voters.\n\nThe White House still believes it has a communications problem or a communicator problem, not a policy problem or a culture problem. The bottom line is this: I do think a little humility still goes a long way with the American voter. If it doesn\u2019t, we\u2019re doomed to some horrible presidential choices over the next few decades. But if I\u2019m right, the first one of these two unpopular presidents who credibly looks voters in the eye and says, \u201cHere\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna do differently, and here are the mistakes I made that I will correct\u201d \u2014 that person is likely to be the president who gets to serve a second four years.\n\nChallenge accepted\n\nLast week, I asked whether anyone could come up with an example of a major American campaign featuring a deeply unpopular incumbent that still succeeded. I noted that the closest parallel to Biden\u2019s current situation was probably overseas, when French President Emmanuel Macon won his re-election over the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen despite sporting a lower job rating than Biden.\n\nWell, a longtime reader and Southern California political analyst, Howard Cohen, reminded me of an example closer to home: then-California Gov. Gray Davis and his successful re-election in 2002 despite an underwater job rating.\n\nDavis is a great parallel: He was the modern pioneer of using his campaign cash to try to \u201chelp\u201d Republicans decide their nominee. Before the state\u2019s all-party, top-two primary system was enacted, California had conventional primaries like most states. Davis\u2019 campaign didn\u2019t want to face former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan in the general election, so the Democrats \u201chelped\u201d another Republican candidate, Bill Simon, make the more conservative case against Riordan. The primary interference worked, and Davis was able to make the idea of Simon as governor a more unpopular choice than re-electing Davis.\n\nOf course, Davis\u2019 campaign worked so well that it inspired a recall less than a year later, giving Arnold Schwarzenegger his opening to make California history. Thanks, Howard, for the California history lesson!\n\nThis week on the Chuck ToddCast from NBC News, Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg explores the strongest potential re-election messages for President Biden.

        "text": "Will young people refuse to vote in the 2024 presidential election?\nAhead of the 2024 presidential election, many young people seem to have lost faith in the democratic process. Some plan to avoid voting entirely, unimpressed by both Democratic candidate Joe Biden and Republican candidate Donald Trump.\n\nThe voter turnout under age 30 has increased in recent presidential elections. The 2020 and 2018 elections each logged \"unusually high turnout\" among young voters, said estimates from the University of Florida's Michael McDonald cited by The Washington Post . Youth participation was record-breaking in 2020, even higher than in the 2008 election, which Barack Obama won after securing 66% of the under-30 vote. But a fall 2023 poll released by the Harvard Kennedy School indicated that young Americans are less likely to vote in 2024. \"At this point in the 2020 election cycle, 57% of Americans between ages 18 and 29 were planning to vote; that number has since declined to 49%,\" said Teen Vogue .\n\nThough Gen Z voters generally prefer Biden over Trump, younger generations are also distancing themselves from the president. \"Poll after poll\" suggests a huge shift in the electorate, said Politico : \"Biden is struggling with young voters but performing better than most Democrats with older ones.\" This is a reversal, as Democratic candidates typically win the youth vote while Republicans lead with seniors. The polls may be wrong \u2014 they did underestimate Trump in the last two elections. But \"if these changes are real, it would have profound effects on the coalitions both campaigns are building,\" Politico added. Biden still leads Trump in voters ages 18 to 29, but that margin is much smaller than it was four years ago; and if Trump's young voters are fewer than Biden's, they are also more enthusiastic .\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

To begin with, many do not support Israel's war in Gaza. A letter signed by leaders of youth organization-focused groups in November 2023 warned that the Biden administration's position on Israel \"risks millions of young voters staying home or voting third party,\" said NBC News . Since October, over 34,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces (about 72% of them women and children, according to Gaza's Government Media Office). Thousands of college students protested the war in the last week, outraged over the United States' continued support of Israel. Separately, Biden recently signed a law that would ban the popular social media app TikTok. If youth protests are swarmed with police and TikTok is gone, where can young people speak out? At the polls, it seems \u2014 or, quite possibly, not at them.\n\n\"Young voters are stuck in a political Groundhog Day \u2014 and many are disillusioned by the lack of choice or younger candidates who reflect their views,\" said Erica Pandey at Axios . The problem is not just this year's presidential candidates, but fatigue on a grander scale. \"Confidence in the nation's institutions has plummeted among younger Americans over the last two election cycles,\" said The Harvard Gazette .\n\nIt's no surprise that backing for Biden has waned. \"He was never young people's preferred candidate in the 2020 primaries; young Americans were reluctant to support him; and though 2020 saw a record number of young people turn out, they still tended to be voting against Trump, rather than for Biden, in the general election,\" said Christian Paz, a political reporter at Vox . In addition to their disapproval of funding Israel's war on Gaza, young people consider Biden not \"progressive enough\" on issues like inflation, health care and abortion access.\n\n\"The real threat to Biden is that younger voters, especially college-educated voters, won't turn out for him in the election,\" Jonathan Zimmerman, a professor of history of education at the University of Pennsylvania, said to The Guardian . \"I wouldn't expect that the protesters on campuses today are going to vote for Trump \u2026 The danger is much simpler: that they simply won't vote.\"\n\nWhat next?",

Those who won the Buckeye State won the national election from 1964 until 2020, when the state took a sharp right turn, ending its bellwether status.\n\nWhat You Need To Know Ohio was a swing state for many years before it shifted toward Republicans\n\n\n\nLosing swing state status is translating into fewer campaign visits and less media attention\n\n\n\nPresidential campaigns have spent $660,000 so far in Ohio this cycle, versus $5.5 million in swing state Pennsylvania\n\nWhen former President Donald Trump won Ohio in 2020 by 8 points, but lost nationally, the political calculus changed for presidential candidates.\n\n\u201cThe fact is in 2024, Ohio is not a battleground state. This is not where the election's going to be won or lost,\u201d said Dave Cohen, professor of political science at the University of Akron. \u201cWe can tell by the number of visits. We can tell by the money that's being spent by the presidential campaigns.\u201d\n\nOhio has been visited by presidential candidates three times this year\u2014twice by Trump and once by Biden. Swing state Pennsylvania has seen a total of nine visits\u2014two by Trump and seven by Biden.\n\nThe Trump and Biden campaigns have collectively spent $5.5 million so far in Pennsylvania, according to campaign finance records, more than eight times the $660,000 they\u2019ve spent in Ohio.\n\nThe shift reflects a change in the demographics of the state, and of the Republican Party.\n\nOhio is whiter and less educated than the U.S. as a whole. Its population has also grown older in recent decades, as the labor force has shed 91,000 workers and young people leave to find jobs.\n\nIn the same period, both older voters and White voters without a college degree have shifted more Republican, according to a Pew Research study.\n\nStill, officials like Toledo Mayor Wade Kapszukiewicz warned not to count the state out yet, pointing to voter referendums last year that legalized recreational cannabis and enshrined abortion rights into the state constitution.\n\nMaybe it's not as much of a swing state as it had been, but I still think it's more of a swing state than maybe some perceive. I think the real story in Ohio is what can happen through gerrymandering,\u201d Kapszukiewicz said. \u201cIt can mask the swing state that I still think it has the potential to be.\u201d\n\nWhile presidential campaigns are spending less in Ohio this cycle, the state\u2019s Senate race is drawing outsized national attention as Republicans seek to turn the balance of power in the Senate.\n\nThe Senate race is currently the second most expensive congressional race in the country this cycle, with $75 million spent so far by campaigns and outside groups.\n\nParadoxically, fewer presidential visits could help Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown\u2019s reelection campaign, which is trying to distance itself from Biden\u2019s 36% approval rating in Ohio.\n\n\u201cEven if Biden were to come to Ohio, I think the Brown campaign would ask him to please not,\u201d Cohen said.",

        "text": "More feelings of misinformation, more news avoidance, U-M study shows\nAs people have more difficulty distinguishing fact from fiction in the United States, they are more likely to feel news fatigue and avoid news altogether, according to a University of Michigan study.\n\nMore than an unintentional avoidance because of lack of media exposure, the researchers say people actively avoid news.\n\nThe researchers also find that people who identify as strong Democrats begin relying more on nonpartisan news media when feeling misinformed, while people who identify as strong Republicans report using less news media overall, including less conservative news media. Their results are published in Journalism Studies.\n\n\u201cThe more confusing or difficult to navigate that you find the news environment, the more you actively avoid news\u2014but it\u2019s not just news,\u201d said lead author Ariel Hasell, U-M assistant professor of communication and media and faculty affiliate of the Center for Political Studies at the Institute for Social Research. \u201cNews avoidance also includes people avoiding discussing politics with others as well. So it\u2019s not just not consuming news, you\u2019re stepping out of the conversation completely.\u201d\n\nHasell and Audrey Halversen, U-M doctoral student in communication and media, drew data from three waves of a national online survey of adults in the United States. The first two waves were collected leading up to the 2020 presidential election, and the final wave was collected shortly after. Nearly 1,200 adults completed the surveys, and the sample closely resembled the U.S. adult population.\n\nThe researchers asked the respondents to rate their feelings of being misinformed online, their active news avoidance, their news fatigue and their online news media use. They also asked the respondents detailed questions about what kinds of news and news websites they read, and found that news avoidance and fatigue increased leading up to the 2020 presidential election.\n\nAdditionally, the researchers showed that being white, conservative and using more conservative media were all significantly associated with feeling more misinformed online, while political interest, political knowledge and nonpartisan news use were significantly associated with feeling less misinformed online.\n\n\u201cFor a lot of people, public discussion about misinformation, the crowdedness of digital media environments and social media, and the amount of information that comes out from so many different sources, drives them away from news,\u201d Hasell said. \u201cThere\u2019s this paradox that the more information that is available, the more people just opt out because it becomes too hard for them to make sense of it.\u201d\n\nHasell says she thinks the United States\u2019 low trust environment is contributing to the effect.\n\n\u201cThat is, when we don\u2019t trust institutions, we don\u2019t have those mental shortcuts to determine whether nonpartisan news outlets are sharing information viewers can trust,\u201d she said. \u201cTen years ago, 20 years ago, 30 years ago, we had a higher trust environment. Even among Democrats, the trust in mainstream news is declining. If you looked at another Western democracy that had more institutional trust in the news media, I\u2019m not sure you would get this same effect.\u201d",

        "text": "Indonesia's next president has a complicated history with the U.S.\nIndonesia's next president has a complicated history with the U.S.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Achmad Ibrahim/AP Achmad Ibrahim/AP\n\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Prabowo Subianto's path to Indonesia's presidency now appears clear. After winning his country's vote in February, he has fended off legal challenges to his election, with the top court rejecting appeals for a re-vote and allegations of fraud. President Biden and other foreign heads of state have sent their congratulations on his election.\n\nBut in a year of big elections worldwide, big questions remain about the aftermath of the vote in the world's third-largest democracy: Has Prabowo turned over a new leaf, or will he drag Indonesia back toward its authoritarian past? And what will relations be like between Prabowo and the United States, the country that first trained and backed him, then later imposed sanctions on him for alleged human rights abuses?\n\nSponsor Message\n\nOn April 22, Indonesia's Constitutional Court dismissed a petition by the two losing candidates in the election, in which they alleged widespread vote-buying and government interference. But to many observers, Prabowo's ascent to the presidency remains problematic.\n\n\"I think we can easily see, actually, that this national election was definitely the least free and the least fair of any election we've had in the post-Suharto period,\" argues Edward Aspinall, an expert on Indonesian politics at the Australian National University in Canberra.\n\nThe fall of former President Suharto in 1998, after three decades of authoritarian rule, led to a period of democratic reforms, during which elections have generally been seen as fair.\n\nHowever, outgoing President Joko Widodo cleared away restraints on presidential power. Critics allege that Widodo muzzled the nation's anti-corruption watchdog in 2019 by stripping it of its independence and making it a government body, and maneuvered his 37-year-old son into position as Prabowo's vice president. Experts suggest Prabowo may have no need to roll back democratic reforms further.\n\nBivitri Susanti, a lecturer at the Indonesia Jentera School of Law, says that given the Biden administration's focus on global democracy, the U.S. should speak out against \"dynastic politics.\"\n\n\"If the U.S. really wants to build an alliance on democracy and rejecting authoritarianism,\" she says, \"I believe this is a big step towards authoritarianism, and so it has to be criticized publicly.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIt is far from clear what kind of president Prabowo will turn out to be, and even critics admit that he has a chance to show that he's changed from his military days, when he is alleged to have committed grave abuses against civilians.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Prabowo declared that \"power and sovereignty are in the hands of the Indonesian people\" and that the country's future would be decided by \"one person, one vote.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP via Getty Images Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP via Getty Images\n\nBut in the past, Aspinall notes, Prabowo has disparaged elections as \"too expensive and too tiring,\" and argued that open opposition to the government \"was not compatible with Indonesia's national culture, which emphasized harmony.\"\n\nSimilarly, observers are looking for signs of whether Prabowo's early attachment to the U.S. \u2014 or his later alienation from it \u2014 will affect his dealings with Washington.\n\nPrabowo graduated from high school at the American School in London, where his family lived in exile. He received special forces training at Fort Bragg, N.C., (renamed Ft. Liberty in 2022) and officer training at what was then Fort Benning, Ga., now Ft. Moore, in the 1980s.\n\nBut Prabowo was discharged in 1998 as head of Kopassus, Indonesia's special forces command, for his role in alleged human rights abuses \u2014 including killing of civilians during Indonesia's 1975 invasion and occupation until 1999 of East Timor, and the disappearance of student activists during protests against Suharto in 1998.\n\nPrabowo was never prosecuted for his actions, as part of what Aspinall calls a \"Faustian bargain\" between the incoming civilian government and Suharto's outgoing generals that gave the generals immunity in exchange for relinquishing their grip on politics.\n\nPrabowo denied the allegations against him. But \"there was abundant evidence that Kopassus and others were essentially functioning as a criminal enterprise. Death squads, so to speak,\" says Tim Rieser, a former foreign policy aide to former Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nRieser helped craft the Leahy Law, which bars the U.S. government from assisting foreign military forces implicated in gross human rights violations. And Leahy himself argued, Rieser says, that \"if there ever was a case for the Leahy law to be applied,\" Indonesia was it.\n\nAs a result of the law, the U.S. cut ties with Kopassus in 1999 and banned Prabowo from entering the U.S. from 2000 until he became defense minister in 2020.\n\n(The U.S. has recently considered whether to apply the Leahy Law to Israel's military for human rights violations against Palestinian civilians, but has so far not imposed any sanctions.)\n\nRieser describes Prabowo as presenting the U.S. with a dilemma between its geopolitical interests and the values it proclaims.\n\n\"We need partners and Indonesia is a country that the United States wants to be a partner of,\" he says. \"On the other hand, I think that we make a mistake \u2014 and we've made this mistake too often \u2014 when we don't stand up for the basic values and principles that people look to us for.\"\n\nRieser notes that part of the problem is competing priorities between branches of government, such as the Pentagon and the State Department.\n\nCongress banned U.S. training of Indonesian armed forces from 1992 to 1995, but the Pentagon continued its training under its own separately funded program, in what former Rep. Nancy Pelosi called a clear \"circumvention of Congress.\"\n\nAnother is shifting historical priorities. The U.S. backed Suharto during the Cold War to fight communism. It called on him to step down after the Cold War was over, when the Clinton administration was trying to promote democracy, and riots erupted in Indonesia against authoritarianism, corruption and economic hardship in 1998.\n\nMany Indonesians are too young to remember this history.\n\nBut the U.S. government, argues Rieser, will hopefully learn from its Cold War-era experiences, and, he says, \"when someone like this [Prabowo] comes to power, we're still going to stand up for now what we believe in\" and publicly support Indonesians fighting for democracy.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nFor now, though, world leaders including President Biden have only sent the president-elect their congratulations.\n\nYosef Riadi contributed to this report in Jakarta.",

        "text": "Georgia oversight panel ruminates on 2020 election hiccups as 2024 showdowns loom\nThe Georgia Election Board voted Tuesday to reprimand Fulton County and appoint an independent monitor for the 2024 election for violating state law while conducting a recount of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nIn a 2-1 vote on the panel that oversees how counties conduct elections, members agreed to admonish Fulton County and order a monitor for this year\u2019s campaigns. That allows the county to avoid paying a fine or having the attorney general investigate the double-counting of 3,075 ballots and other allegations of irregularities during the 2020 presidential recount. Georgia election officials determined mistakes in 2020 by county election workers would not have changed the outcome.\n\nGeorgia Secretary of State investigators said they are unable to determine how many of the invalid ballots were included in the results used to certify the 2020 election. Democrat Joe Biden narrowly defeated GOP nominee Donald Trump by nearly 12,000 votes.\n\nState officials reported that there were 3,075 duplicate ballot images, but they were unable to determine how many of the ones cast were tabulated in the recount. The court case revolves around apparent discrepancies between the initial recount totals in November 2020 and the corrected totals released a day later by Fulton County.\n\nAccording to Fulton\u2019s initial results, Trump received 137,240 votes out of 524,659, while Biden received 381,144. Following a recount requested by Trump\u2019s lawyers, the final results led to the former president gaining seven additional votes and Biden losing 932.\n\nIn January 2021, Fulton officials acknowledged failures to properly back up data to servers during the recount. A Fulton election official told the state election officials that the discrepancy likely resulted from the mishandling of ballot batches and that changes have since been made to separate ballots once they\u2019re scanned.\n\nElection board member Ed Lindsey Jr. offered a motion Tuesday to reprimand Fulton and appoint an independent monitor who could be in place prior to the November general election.\n\nIf the state election and Fulton officials fail to agree on who to hire as the election monitor, he said, then he would recommend in July that the board ask the state attorney general to take the case.\n\n\u201cMy purpose here is not to let it ride but to move this matter forward so that we can have some assurance regarding the 2024 election,\u201d said Lindsey, a Republican and former lawmaker who was appointed to the state election board by the Georgia House of Representatives in January 2022.\n\nState Election Board member Janice Johnston, an appointee of the Georgia Republican Party, voted against the motion, citing the need for a more comprehensive examination of Fulton\u2019s election operations.\n\n\u201cWith over 140 violations of election laws and rules, it would be a travesty not to refer this to the Attorney General and let this ride,\u201d she said.\n\nCharlene McGowan, general counsel under Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, said that despite the recount discrepancies, the election results are still accurate after being counted three times. That includes the initial tally by the Dominion Voting Systems equipment, a full-hand count and another rescanning of ballots, which led to the dispute about the double counting of ballots.\n\n\u201cThe paper ballot is the record of the vote,\u201d McGowan said. \u201cIt is the most important document and it is what is used to tabulate the vote and to tabulate the results. As long as we have that paper ballot, we have the paper trail that accurately records the voter\u2019s choice.\u201d\n\nGeorgia\u2019s Secretary of State opened an investigation after a complaint was filed in July 2022 by Georgia resident Joseph Rossi and Kevin Moncla, a far-right Texas activist, alleging that Fulton County failed to correctly conduct a machine recount and other irregularities tied to the 2020 election.\n\nThe complaint also says that the county is missing more than 17,000 ballot images that were requested for inspection from the 2020 election.\n\nThe state Legislature passed a law requiring ballot images to be kept as public record after the 2020 election and state officials said that not having all of the ballot images from that year doesn\u2019t mean that the votes weren\u2019t correctly tabulated.\n\nMarilyn Marks, executive director of the Coalition for Good Governance, described Tuesday\u2019s board meeting as a forum for conflicting information provided by people with an ax to grind, officials with a reason to be defensive including the secretary of state and Fulton, as well as members of the Georgia election board.\n\nGood Governance is a lead plaintiff in a federal lawsuit contesting the security of Georgia\u2019s electronic voting machines due to cybersecurity threats.\n\n\u201cThe entire debate about the Rossi complaint concerning materially inaccurate Fulton 2020 audit tallies, and machine recount tallies, including thousands of double-counted votes made one thing crystal clear\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe State Election Board is failing in its investigative duties by assigning the SOS office to investigate election code violations where the SOS office itself is accused of wrongdoing, as in this case,\u201d Marks said in a statement. \u201cThe Board\u2019s investigations must be conducted independent of interested parties, to provide objectivity and transparency.\u201d\n\nMarks said that the dispute about the 17,000 missing ballot images could be resolved after Gov. Brian Kemp on Tuesday signed an election bill allowing the public to inspect paper ballots.\n\n\u201cHowever, thanks to the legislation Gov. Kemp signed today, the truth about the 2020 count, likely still confirming Biden\u2019s win, will come out. Given that the public will be able to require a new scan of the ballots themselves, the SOS claims that they cannot determine whether ballots were double counted will be shown to be false, with many ballots for both candidates being double counted in the official machine recount. The ballots representing the 17,000+ final votes where the images cannot be located, can be examined now and their existence verified.\u201d\n\nAccording to state election investigators, Fulton might not have all of the ballot images, but each of the original paper ballots are under seal due to pending litigation\n\nIn 2023, the election board rejected a state takeover of Fulton ballot counting following a lengthy performance review after the tumultuous 2020 presidential election brought some unwanted national attention to Georgia\u2019s most populated county. The independent panel report did not find any proof of election workers engaging in intentional misconduct but noted Fulton elections new leadership role is now resolving past problems with managerial oversight, disorganization and mistakes in recounting ballots.\n\nThis story comes to GPB through a reporting partnership with Georgia Recorder.",

        "text": "Biden needs these core voters for the 2024 race\nFor more politics coverage and analysis, sign up for Here\u2019s the Deal, our weekly politics newsletter, here.\n\nAs we hit the six-months-until-the-election window, we\u2019ve been thinking about President Joe Biden\u2019s core base of support.\n\nIn the past two PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist polls, there have been standout shifts for some key Biden groups.\n\nAs a reminder: It\u2019s easy for polls to be misused. They\u2019re less like maps and more like compasses. They can indicate wide trends and give a sense of bearing.\n\nWith that (and margin of error) in mind, here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching.\n\nSuburbanites\n\nLet\u2019s start with a demographic that helped block Hillary Clinton from the White House, but helped Biden win it: suburbanites.\n\nBiden won 54 percent of voters in the \u2018burbs in 2020, flipping the group for Democrats from Clinton\u2019s 45 percent.\n\nNow in 2024, there are signs that support from suburban adults is on pause.\n\nIn the single month between our March and April polls, Biden saw both his approval rating and favorability ratings among this group drop to less than 50 percent.\n\nA closer look at favorability shows that 52 percent of suburban adults had a favorable impression of Biden in late March. Weeks later, it was just 43 percent. Even considering margins of error, that\u2019s a fast drop.\n\n\n\nThe margin of error is a range that shows us how close those estimates represent reality, serving as a \u201cguidepost\u201d to help us interpret data and attitudes. Lee Miringoff, who directs the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, discusses these statistical concepts to better the nuance in polling data. Video by PBS NewsHour\n\nBiden is fortunate in that the figures for how people will likely vote if the election were today did not slide by nearly as much. But they did slip. In March, given the choice between Biden, Trump, and independent and green party candidates, 50 percent of suburban registered voters chose Biden. In April, it was 47 percent.\n\nThat is not enough to be statistically significant. And Biden still is ahead of Donald Trump with suburban voters when they\u2019re asked who they\u2019d support if the election were today. But it is symbolically significant, inching toward that doomed 45 percent mark that Clinton saw in 2016.\n\nWomen\n\nWhile smaller demographics can have outsized influence, the larger the voting block the more impactful their swings.\n\nThis brings us to women, who make up slightly more than 50 percent of the population, per the U.S. Census Bureau. Women have also voted in slightly higher percentages than men in every presidential election since 1980, per the Center for American Women and Politics.\n\nSimply put, they are one of the largest and most powerful voting groups in the country. And Biden won 55 percent of women voters in 2020.",

        "text": "Latino voting behavior: Bad polling leads to bad assumptions\nRelying on national samples with very limited representation of Latino respondents, an array of national news stories have projected former President Trump to capture a larger share of the Latino vote than he did in his 2020 loss to President Biden. In this post, we point out some of the limitations associated with national polls that make projections for Latino voting behavior to help illustrate how polls can lead to inaccurate inferences. We also take a look back at the 2022 election to highlight how assumptions made about Latino voters regarding abortion led to inaccurate predictions that Latinos would help the GOP win big across congressional races, noting that we are in danger of doing the same thing now in 2024.\n\nThe 2022 election season was full of pundits and supposed political experts coalescing around the notion that Republicans would ride a red wave to effective control of the House. That wave never materialized, due in part to Latinos supporting Democratic congressional candidates by a two-to-one margin. Given this result, it is surprising to Latino political scholars that a similar narrative is being repeated now in the run up to the 2024 presidential election. This is worrisome, given that this issue is not new. In fact, one of the co-authors of this article (Gabriel R. Sanchez) has been part of a wider community of scholars in Latino politics who have been critical of the National Exit Poll going back to the 2016 election. The basis of our criticism was that this widely cited survey was not designed to provide large and representative samples of Latinos.\n\nHere is the crux of our critique.\n\n1. National election polls are not designed for sub-group analysis.\n\nIt is important to take a step back and remind ourselves what the goal is for most polls this early in the election season. Most national polls are designed to provide a snapshot of the full electorate\u2019s attitudes, voting preferences, policy priorities, and enthusiasm levels at this stage in the campaign season. Reputable polls do a good job of meeting this goal.\n\nHowever, these national samples are not designed to capture variation within sub-samples of the larger electorate, including Latino voters. Consequently, many national polls either suffer from a low sample size of Latino voters and/or a sub-sample of Latinos that is not designed to be nationally representative of that population. Take for example the CNBC All-America Economic Survey from December of 2023 that found Trump had a five-point lead with Latino voters against Biden in a head-to-head question design. While the poll has a respectable overall sample size of 1,002 Americans, when you look at the full results of the survey, you find that only 14% of the sample are Latino (common among national samples), which is roughly 140 Latino respondents. Although the overall margin of error is small for this poll\u2019s overall sample (+/- 3.1%), the margin of error approaches +/- 10% when referencing the Latino data. This means that the five percent lead for Trump could actually be a five percent lead for Biden or a 15% Trump advantage.\n\nThis is far from unique to this poll, as a poll from CNN, which also predicted Trump to be in the lead, includes a sample size of less than 125 for the Latino sub-sample. A poll by The Economist only has a sub-sample size of 174 Latinos, and a poll by FAU only had 69 Latino respondents in their overall sample. These small sub-sample sizes lead to significant inaccuracies in assessing the true preferences and opinions of the Latino electorate.\n\n2. National election polls do not poll in Spanish.\n\nAnother clear limitation of many surveys not specifically designed for the Latino community is whether the survey was available in Spanish (or other languages depending on the community you are interested in). It is easier and less expensive to conduct polls only in English, so many national polls do not provide Spanish-speaking Latinos with the option to take the survey in their native language. However, we know from prior elections that language is a demographic factor that influences Latino political behavior, with Spanish-speaking Latinos being 15% less likely to have voted for Trump in the 2016 election, so systemically excluding them from national samples can generate biased inferences.1 Not surprisingly, few new national election surveys conducted this cycle have had Spanish interviews.\n\n3. Issue importance can be misleading without content.\n\nWhile identifying the sample size of a poll\u2019s Latino sub-sample and whether the poll was conducted in Spanish are easy tests to conduct when evaluating the potential accuracy of a poll, other factors associated with polling can be much more complex. This includes measuring issue priorities from polls and making inferences based on the issues identified as important to Latinos and other sub-groups of the electorate.\n\nIn 2022, the best example of this was the salience of abortion and reproductive health to Latino voters. As one of our co-authors (Sanchez) has written about at Brookings, in 2022, polls showed that abortion was one of the top priorities for Latino voters\u2014higher even than immigration. As abortion shot up in issue salience following the Dobbs decision, the perception among political pundits and national media was that this would benefit Republican candidates in 2022 given the widespread belief that Latinos were conversative on abortion policy.\n\nThe challenge with issue salience measures in surveys asking voters what the most important set of issue priorities are that will impact their voting behavior is that they do not provide information about the position the respondent has on the policy issue. For example, while surveys with Latino respondents were making clear that abortion was an important issue for Latino voters, most surveys did not give an indication of whether Latino voters wanted greater restrictions on abortion or wider access. Fortunately, there were surveys with large Latino samples that were representative of the Latino electorate, conducted bilingually, and full of content that could fill this void in Latino abortion attitudes.\n\nOne of these surveys asked Latino respondents who chose abortion as one of their top priorities what they \u201chad in mind\u201d when they said abortion was an important issue, a very valuable measure to help inform projections about the Latino vote. As reflected in the figure below, the results from this question in a national Latino survey from the summer of 2022 made clear that the overwhelming majority of these Latino voters had liberal attitudes about abortion, expressing concern that banning abortions would put women\u2019s lives at risk or that access to reproductive health would be restricted by state and local governments. This valuable information helps explain why the Dobbs decision helped Democrats exceed expectations in 2022.",

        "text": "U.S. House GOP targets noncitizen voting, even though it\u2019s rare \u2022 Nebraska Examiner\nWASHINGTON \u2014 U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson unveiled a bill Wednesday that would require states to verify proof of citizenship to prevent noncitizens from voting in federal elections, something already barred under the law.\n\nJohnson, a Louisiana Republican who played a key role through legal challenges in defending the former president\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, said at a press conference that voting by noncitizens is \u201ca clear and present danger to the integrity of our election system.\u201d\n\nOutside the U.S. Capitol, Johnson was joined by former Trump aides Stephen Miller and Ken Cuccinelli, Tea Party Patriots co-founder Jenny Beth Martin and Cleta Mitchell, a key figure who tried to overturn the 2020 presidential election and is now running a grassroots organization to aggressively monitor elections in November.\n\nThe bill would amend the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 to require proof of citizenship to vote in federal elections, according to bill text provided by the office of the sponsor, Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas.\n\n\u201cUnder any method of voter registration in a State, the State shall not accept and process an application to register to vote in an election for Federal office unless the applicant presents documentary proof of United States citizenship with the application,\u201d according to the bill text.\n\nIt would also allow states to check citizenship through federal databases with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Social Security Administration. The bill bars DHS from charging a fee to the state for complying with a request to verify citizenship.\n\nProof of citizenship would also be required for mail-in voting, and registration agencies would also have to verify proof of citizenship while registering someone to vote.\n\nThe bill would allow states to remove noncitizen voters from voter rolls.\n\nJohnson meeting with Trump\n\nThe press conference came after Johnson met with former President Donald J. Trump last month, and Johnson announced plans to take up legislation related to noncitizens voting in federal elections.\n\nThe April event doubled as support from the former president, as Johnson was facing increasing pressure from hard-right members threatening to oust him from his role.\n\nThe threat to oust Johnson as speaker is ongoing from Georgia\u2019s Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nJohnson on Wednesday did not give details on when he would schedule the bill for a vote on the House floor.\n\nUtah\u2019s GOP Sen. Mike Lee will introduce the companion bill in the Senate.\n\n\u201cWhen federal law has been interpreted as precluding, in many ways, the voter registration officials in the various states from even inquiring into someone\u2019s citizenship when addressing voter roll issues, we have a problem,\u201d Lee said.\n\nWith Democrats controlling a slim majority in the Senate, the measure is unlikely to be brought up for a floor vote.\n\nResearchers and studies have shown that noncitizens rarely vote in federal elections. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, conducted an analysis of election conduct from 2003 to 2023 and found 29 instances of noncitizens voting.\n\nA few cities and towns allow noncitizens to vote in local elections, a move that has spurred a GOP backlash and sparked a conservative national rallying cry about noncitizens voting.\n\n\u2018Designed to stoke fear\u2019\n\nSince 2020, five states \u2014 Alabama, Colorado, Florida, Ohio, and Louisiana \u2014 have amended their constitutions to make it clear that only citizens can vote in elections at any level.\n\nTrump has made his reelection campaign center on immigration, and the former president and Republicans are pushing the false narrative of noncitizens often voting in federal elections.\n\nThe executive director of a policy think tank, Sam Oliker-Friedland of the Institute for Responsive Government Action, said in a statement that the bill does not improve election security.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing more than a messaging bill designed to stoke fear and undermine confidence in our democracy,\u201d Oliker-Friedland said. \u201cThere is no evidence to support the claim that there are waves of non-citizens voting.\u201d\n\nThe top Democrat on the Committee on House Administration, Joseph Morelle of New York, slammed the bill for trying to solve a \u201cnon-existent problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cNon-citizen voting in federal elections is already a federal crime,\u201d Morelle said in a statement. \u201cStates already have several systems in place to deter non-citizen voting and people who violate the law face prison time and deportation.\u201d",

Kennedy experienced 'memory loss and mental fogginess so severe that a friend grew concerned he might have a brain tumour' He also had mercury poisoning, which can cause neurological problems, the paper says .",
        "text": "Robert F Kennedy Jr says health issue caused by dead worm in his brain\nRobert F Kennedy Jr, the third-party candidate for US president, said a health problem he experienced in 2010 \u201cwas caused by a worm that got into my brain and ate a portion of it and then died\u201d, the New York Times reported.\n\nThe startling words were contained in a divorce case deposition from 2012 the Times said it obtained.\n\nTwo years before the deposition, the paper said, Kennedy experienced \u201cmemory loss and mental fogginess so severe that a friend grew concerned he might have a brain tumour\u201d.\n\nNeurologists who treated Kennedy\u2019s uncle, the Massachusetts senator Ted Kennedy, before his death aged 77 from brain cancer in 2009, told the younger man he had a dark spot on his brain scans, and concluded he too had a tumour.\n\nBut, Kennedy reportedly said, a doctor at New York-Presbyterian hospital posited another explanation: a parasite in Kennedy\u2019s brain.\n\nSpeaking this winter, the paper said, Kennedy told the Times that at around the same time he learned of the parasite in his brain he was also found to have mercury poisoning, which can cause neurological problems, probably due to eating a lot of fish.\n\nIn the 2012 deposition, Kennedy reportedly said: \u201cI have cognitive problems, clearly. I have short-term memory loss, and I have longer-term memory loss that affects me.\u201d\n\nIn his recent interview, the Times said, Kennedy said he had recovered from such problems. The paper also said Kennedy\u2019s spokesperson, Stefanie Spear, responded to a question about whether the candidate\u2019s health problems could compromise his fitness to be president by saying: \u201cThat is a hilarious suggestion, given the competition.\u201d\n\nNow 70, Kennedy has suffered other issues including a heart problem for which he has been repeatedly hospitalised and spasmodic dysphonia, a neurological condition that affects his voice.\n\nNonetheless, the scion of a famous political clan \u2013 his father was the US attorney general and New York senator Robert F Kennedy, his uncle John F Kennedy, the 35th president \u2013 has focused on showing off his physical fitness in contrast to that of Joe Biden, the oldest president ever elected, now 81, and Donald Trump, the 77-year-old Republican challenger.\n\nThe Times said Kennedy declined to share his medical records. Biden and Trump have not released theirs in this election cycle.\n\nObservers on the left and right of US politics fear Kennedy\u2019s campaign, which leans into his prominence as a Covid vaccine conspiracy theorist and other outsider positions, could siphon key votes from both Biden and Trump \u2013 candidates with whom the public is largely dissatisfied.\n\nKennedy has gained ballot access or is pursuing it in key states, including by securing nominations from fringe parties. In April, a host of Kennedy family members appeared in Philadelphia to publicly back Biden.\n\nThe Times said the 2012 deposition it obtained was given during Kennedy\u2019s divorce from his second wife, Mary Richardson Kennedy.\n\nKennedy, then an environmental attorney and campaigner, argued that his earning power was diminished by his neurological and cognitive problems, the Times said.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Kennedy reportedly said he thought he might have contracted the parasite in southern Asia. The Times said experts who did not treat Kennedy thought the parasite \u201cwas likely a pork tapeworm larva\u201d.\n\n\u201cSome tapeworm larvae can live in a human brain for years without causing problems,\u201d the Times said. \u201cOthers can wreak havoc, often when they start to die, which causes inflammation. The most common symptoms are seizures, headaches and dizziness.\u201d\n\nBut Scott Gardner, curator of the Manter Laboratory for Parasitology at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, told the paper severe memory loss, as described by Kennedy (who told the Times he experienced \u201csevere brain fog\u201d), was more often associated with mercury poisoning.\n\nIn his 2012 deposition, the Times said, Kennedy also discussed his spasmodic dysphonia, which he said had affected his earnings from public speaking.\n\nKennedy recently told Vladislav \u201cDJ Vlad\u201d Lyubovny, \u201ca Ukrainian-American interviewer, journalist and former DJ\u201d, that last year he went to Kyoto, Japan, \u201cto get a surgery, a procedure \u2026 that is not available here in the United States\u201d and which involved putting \u201ca titanium bridge between your vocal chords\u201d.\n\nKennedy\u2019s deposition also included discussion of his heart problems, which he said began in college, the Times reported.\n\nSaying the condition was triggered by stress, caffeine and sleep deprivation, Kennedy reportedly said: \u201cIt feels like there\u2019s a bag of worms in my chest.\u201d",

Our priority remains support for Ukraine and its people fighting against Russian aggression.\u201d\n\nThe Czech Republic is also expected to snub the ceremony, while Germany\u2019s Foreign Office said its representative would not attend \u2013 it earlier recalled its ambassador over alleged Russian cyberattacks.\n\nAn aide to Putin said the heads of all foreign diplomatic missions in Moscow including those from \u201cunfriendly states\u201d had been invited to attend the inauguration, which starts at noon (09:00 GMT) and will be broadcast live on Russian television.\n\nPutin is due to arrive in a luxury motorcade \u2013 state-run RT reported modifications to his armoured Aurus limousine including improved sound insulation and all-round cameras \u2013 at the Grand Kremlin Palace. The one-time KGB spy will then walk through the palace corridors to the ornate Saint Andrew Hall, where he will take the presidential oath and make a brief address. He will also received a blessing from the patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\nThe ceremony is taking place a day after Russia announced plans for a tactical nuclear weapons drill, blaming what it said were \u201cprovocative\u201d moves by Western countries over Ukraine. Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than two years ago.\n\n\u201cUkraine sees no legal grounds for recognising him as the democratically elected and legitimate president of the Russian Federation,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.\n\nTuesday\u2019s swearing-in ceremony, it said, sought to create \u201cthe illusion of legality for the nearly lifelong stay in power of a person who has turned the Russian Federation into an aggressor state and the ruling regime into a dictatorship\u201d.\n\nDespite the apparent boycotts, France, Hungary and Slovakia are all expected to send representatives to the ceremony, Reuters reported, citing unnamed diplomatic sources.\n\nSpeaking alongside China\u2019s president on Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron said: \u201cWe are not at war with Russia or the Russian people, and we have no desire for regime change in Moscow.\u201d\n\nThe source said France had previously condemned the context of repression in which the election was held, depriving voters of a real choice, as well as the organisation of elections in Ukrainian territories occupied by Russia, which France considers a violation of international law and the United Nations Charter.\n\nFranco-Russian relations have deteriorated in recent months as Paris has increased its support for Ukraine.\n\nLast week, Macron said it would be legitimate for France to send troops to Ukraine if Russia broke through the Ukrainian front lines and Kyiv requested assistance.",

        "text": "House of Representatives passes Edwards\u2019 bill to only include U.S. citizens in congressional representation\nToday the U.S. House of Representatives voted for and passed U.S. Congressman Chuck Edwards\u2019 (NC-11) bill, the Equal Representation Act, by a vote of 206-202.\n\nEdwards spoke on the House floor to highlight the need to protect America\u2019s democracy and electoral integrity by making sure that only American citizens are counted when apportioning congressional seats and, consequently, Electoral College votes.\n\nEdwards\u2019 full remarks as prepared for delivery are below, or you may watch online here.\n\n\"One of the lesser acknowledged, but equally alarming, side effects of this administration\u2019s failure to secure the southern border is the illegal immigrant population\u2019s influence in America\u2019s electoral process.\n\n\"Our democracy depends on accurate representation and electoral integrity. Voting is a coveted privilege held by American citizens, and elected representatives are responsible for serving the interests of the voters in their district.\n\n\"But even if not a single illegal alien casts a vote, the mere presence of illegal immigrants in the U.S. is having a profound impact on the outcome of elections, skewing the representation of Americans.\n\n\"Mr. Biggs points out that the U.S. Constitution mandates that a census be carried out every ten years, where everyone who is present in the United States, regardless of their citizenship and immigration status, is counted. But the Constitution does not specify whether noncitizens or illegal aliens must be counted for the purpose of apportioning House seats.\n\n\"You may recall that in 2016, President Trump - through executive order - added a citizenship question back to the 2020 census. The same question that had been legally asked on every census since 1820, until it was removed in 1960 - not because there was anything found wrong with the question, but because the effect of illegal immigration was negligible at the time. But there\u2019s no doubt today, that the effect of illegal immigration is significant. I won\u2019t waste my time making that case \u2013 we all know it. It\u2019s a top concern of about 70% of all Americans.\n\n\"Though commonsense dictates that only citizens should be counted for apportionment purposes, illegal aliens have nonetheless recently been counted toward the final tallies that determine how many House seats each state is allocated and the number of electoral votes it will wield in presidential elections.\n\n\"And since the illegal alien population is not evenly distributed throughout the nation, American citizens in some states are losing representation in Congress to illegal aliens in other states.\n\n\"A 2019 study by the Center for Immigration Studies estimates illegal immigrants and non-citizens who have not naturalized and do not have the right to vote impact the distribution of 26 House seats.\n\n\"My bill, the Equal Representation Act, would finally address this alarming undermining of American democracy by requiring a citizenship question be added back to the 2030 census, creating reporting requirements for data gathered from the citizenship question, and requiring that only U.S. citizens be counted for the purpose of congressional apportionment.\n\n\"Mr. Speaker, this bill will no doubt draw criticism from those who don\u2019t want to fix the problem \u2013 and who seek to gain political influence by not fixing it. They will claim to have become experts on our Constitution. They will point to the word 'persons' in Section 2 of the 14th Amendment as a reason why this bill should not pass. But this word carries no definition in our Constitution, and it offers multiple different meanings in current law.\n\n\"Allow me to argue. In 1992, Franklin v Massachusetts \u2013 a Supreme Court case on apportionment of representatives \u2013 opined the term 'persons' to mean an individual who not only has a physical presence, but some element of allegiance to a particular place.\n\n\"The Census Bureau does not include foreigners who visit the U.S. for a vacation or a business trip in the population count, since they have no political or legal allegiance to any state or the federal government. Similarly, illegal aliens who are deportable have no allegiance or enduring tie to the U.S.\n\n\"Foreigners here on visas have an allegiance politically and legally to their home countries, not to the U.S. So, the same logic applies to them.\n\n\"Further, in the 2008 Supreme Court case District of Columbia v. Heller, the justices defined \u2018the people\u2019 to mean all members of the U.S. political community.\n\n\"To be a member of a political community, you must be an eligible voter.\n\n\"Illegal immigrants and non-citizens are not eligible voters.\n\n\"Let me also point out that the explicit question of whether apportionment must include aliens under our Constitution has never been ruled on by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\"Enacting this legislation into law is vitally important to ensuring that the American people receive fair representation in Congress and that they - and only they - determine the outcomes of presidential elections.\n\n\"Our lawless immigration system is already shaking the confidence of the American people in countless ways. Without reforms to how our Census is conducted, confidence in the integrity of our electoral system could be eroded entirely in the coming decade.\n\n\"My bill is a commonsense solution to a chronic problem impacting the very governance and democracy of this country, and I ask that my colleagues vote in support.\"",

Frelimo respects the laws, he added, so there was no reason to speculate about new term limits.\n\nNyusi also encouraged party members to support Chapo in the upcoming elections.\n\nSince Mozambique\u2019s independence in 1975, all heads of state have been nominated by Frelimo.\n\nThe party has won all elections since multi-party democracy was introduced 30 years ago at the end of a crippling 16-year civil war which left over one million people dead and five million others internally displaced.\n\nChapo has been governor of Inhambane province since 2016. He holds a master\u2019s degree in development management from a university in Mozambique. Prior to entering politics, he taught constitutional law and political science at the Universidade Catolica in the port city of Beira, and worked as an announcer at a private radio station in the same city.\n\nAfter being confirmed as Frelimo\u2019s candidate, Chapo promised to work to promote the country\u2019s economic development.\n\nIf elected, Chapo will become Mozambique\u2019s fourth democratically elected head of state.\n\nChapo is viewed by analysts as a leader who may be able to restore security in the troubled oil- and gas-rich province of Cabo Delgado, where Islamic State-linked insurgents have been terrorizing civilians and destroying public infrastructure since 2017, forcing the interruption of multibillion-dollar projects.\n\nThe violence has continued despite support by troops from other countries of the Southern African Development Community, and soldiers from Rwanda.\n\nEconomic analyst and university lecturer Alcidio Bachita has high hopes for Chapo.\n\n\u201cHe is an individual who has not been accused of any corruption schemes,\u201d Bachita said. \u201cAnd I believe that this change of leadership will open a new page in the history of Mozambique, given that he is a young man and was born after [the] independence period of the country. So I believe that the economy of Mozambique will witness a great performance in the coming years.\u201d\n\nMozambique will hold its seventh presidential and legislative elections on October 9.\n\nThe deadline for presenting lists of candidates for president to the Constitutional Council is June 10.",

She left the race in March\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 The ghost of Nikki Haley\u2019s presidential campaign is ringing up significant support in state primaries despite her withdrawal from the race in March shortly before Donald Trump had clinched the Republican nomination.\n\nThe backing for Haley \u2014 most recently in Indiana, where she grabbed more than 21% of the votes on Tuesday \u2014 signals persistent discontent among party voters with the former president. He is racking up primary victories even as he has been spending much of his time recently in a New York courtroom facing state criminal charges involving hush money payments to a porn actor.\n\nHaley, the former South Carolina governor and U.N. ambassador who qualified for the Indiana ballot before she ended her campaign two months ago, has not endorsed Trump.\n\nA Haley campaign adviser did not immediately return a message seeking comment on the results.\n\nIndiana Democrats did not have the option to vote \u201c uncommitted \u201d in their party primary. Unease about President Joe Biden\u2019s handling of the Israel-Hamas war has sparked a protest vote movement in some states, raising similar questions about the strength of his support in November.\n\nHaley\u2019s support was largest in Indiana\u2019s urban and suburban counties. She won 35% of the vote in Indianapolis\u2019s Marion County and more than one-third of the vote in suburban Hamilton County.

Haley won only 14% of the vote in Lake County.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign attributed Haley\u2019s Indiana showing to Trump\u2019s trouble in suburbs and cited similar primary numbers in swing states such as Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania. The president has made an open appeal to Haley supporters to back him in November.\n\nThe Trump campaign claimed without evidence that Haley\u2019s support came from Democrats, adding that he would carry Indiana in November, as in 2016 and 2020.\n\nTwo weeks ago in Pennsylvania, Haley received nearly 17% of the primary vote. She earned similar support in Arizona just weeks after her exit.\n\nTrump, who won every Indiana county, brushed off Haley\u2019s support in an interview Tuesday with WGAL-TV of Lancaster, Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cAll of those people are going to come to me,\u201d he said.\n\nIn late January, Trump said prematurely that Haley did not have enough signatures to make Indiana\u2019s primary ballot. While Haley did get the minimum 500 signatures needed in each congressional district to make the ballot, the margin was razor thin in the 7th District, which includes Indianapolis.\n\nHaley\u2019s campaign was largely absent from the state even while she was in the race.\n\nIndiana, with its 11 electoral votes, is far from the swing state that Pennsylvania is. Trump won Indiana by 16 percentage points in 2020.\n\nNonetheless, Haley\u2019s support from 1 in 5 Republican voters raises questions about how they will vote in the fall. Before she dropped out, she took nearly 27% of votes in Michigan. She received 13% of the Georgia GOP vote shortly after her exit.\n\nHaley, who ended her campaign after losses to Trump across almost all Super Tuesday states in early March, recently announced she was joining the Hudson Institute, a conservative Washington think tank. In her farewell speech a day after Trump\u2019s big night, Haley declined to directly endorse him. She put the onus on Trump to win the support of the moderate Republicans and independent voters who had supported her.\n\n\u201cIt is now up to Donald Trump to earn the votes of those in our party and beyond it who did not support him. And I hope he does that,\u201d she said. \u201cAt its best, politics is about bringing people into your cause, not turning them away. And our conservative cause badly needs more people.\u201d\n\nTrump had been withering in his criticism of Haley, calling her \u201cBirdbrain\u201d in speeches to his supporters and questioning her decision to stay in the race.\n\nJust before Super Tuesday, Haley said she no longer felt bound by a pledge that required all GOP contenders to support the party\u2019s eventual nominee in order to participate in the primary debates.\n\nShe has said little publicly but has continued to utilize her email outreach, via her Stand for America PAC, sending out updates on her Hudson appointment, as well as the return of her husband, Michael, from a South Carolina Army National Guard deployment that saw him stationed in African during a large portion of her primary campaign.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Meg Kinnard in Columbia, South Carolina, contributed to this report.",

        "text": "The 1964 Campaign Ad That Leveraged Cold War Fears\nWith fears of nuclear annihilation looming large, Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s campaign team went for the jugular during the 1964 U.S. presidential race. In a minute-long television ad, a massive atomic blast blots out a young girl innocently plucking the petals of a daisy. The ad never mentioned Johnson\u2019s opponent, Senator Barry Goldwater. But the implication was clear: A vote for Goldwater meant a vote for nuclear war.\n\nThough he almost certainly would have won anyway, the so-called \u201cDaisy\u201d ad\u2014officially known as \u201cPeace, Little Girl\u201d\u2014helped Johnson secure a landslide electoral victory. It also ushered in an era of negative political advertising that has yet to abate and cemented the importance of TV to political campaigns.\n\nCampaign Spot: Peace Little Girl (1964)\n\n\u201cIt was a style of political advertising that no one had ever tried before,\u201d says Robert Mann, a professor of mass communication at Louisiana State University and author of Daisy Petals and Mushroom Clouds: LBJ, Barry Goldwater, and the Ad That Changed American Politics.\n\nBefore then, Mann explains, campaigns generally took a fact-based approach to ads, selling their candidates like they would a bar of soap. Many of Johnson\u2019s ads, on the other hand, were pithy, short spots designed to generate a visceral emotional response.\n\nJohnson\u2019s campaign capitalized on what Mann describes as an \u201cexistential fear\u201d that gripped the United States at the height of the Cold War, particularly in the wake of the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. \u201cAnxiety was pretty high to begin with,\u201d Mann says. \u201cBut the missile crisis \u2026 really supercharged that.\u201d\n\nGoldwater Opposed Nuclear Disarmament\n\nBy 1964, the United States and Soviet Union had over 30,000 nuclear weapons between them, prompting fallout shelters to proliferate across America. Mann recalls crouching under his school desk during atomic bomb drills, worried about both sides being \u201carmed to the teeth.\u201d Surveys show he was far from alone in fearing nuclear war.\n\nYet, as Mann points out, a hawkish segment of the Republican Party tended to treat nuclear weapons cavalierly as part of a policy of standing firm against the Soviets. Goldwater, for example, called the atomic bomb \u201cmerely another weapon,\u201d suggested using \u201clow-yield\u201d nuclear arms to defoliate forests and disrupt enemy supply lines in Vietnam, and joked about lobbing a nuclear missile into the men\u2019s room of the Kremlin.\n\nThe President's Nuclear Football\n\nIn addition, Goldwater opposed both nuclear disarmament and limitations to nuclear weapons testing. He thought the use of nuclear weapons shouldn\u2019t always require presidential approval, and he mocked those who \u201cwould rather crawl on [their] knees to Moscow than die under an atom bomb.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven people around Goldwater thought it was madness,\u201d Mann says. Richard Nixon, for one, said, \u201cBarry is on the record with statements that an opponent will use to cut his guts out.\u201d\n\nIndeed, during the 1964 race, Goldwater\u2019s main Republican rivals painted him as untrustworthy on nuclear weapons. Though he secured the Republican nomination anyway, he did nothing to assuage his critics, famously declaring at the Republican National Convention that \u201cextremism in the defense of liberty is no vice.\u201d\n\nJohnson, who had become president the previous year following the John F. Kennedy assassination, was only too happy to pounce. His campaign relentlessly portrayed Goldwater as an unstable extremist, not just for his nuclear positions but also for opposing the Civil Rights Act and for stating that Social Security ought to be voluntary. In private, Johnson called Goldwater \u201cnutty as a fruitcake.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Johnson saw himself \u201cas this source of order and calm and composure\u201d who would \u201ckeep everyone safe,\u201d says Kent Germany, a professor of history at the University of South Carolina and editor of multiple volumes of LBJ\u2019s recordings.\n\nWhat Happens in the 'Daisy' Ad\n\nTo produce TV spots, Johnson\u2019s campaign turned to Doyle Dane Bernbach, a New York advertising firm it had inherited from the Kennedy administration. For the \u201cDaisy\u201d ad, the firm filmed a three-year-old child actress standing in what appears to be a rural field, but was in actuality a Manhattan park.\n\nAfter the girl plucks the petals of a daisy while counting them, the camera zooms in on her eye as a nuclear explosion erupts in the background. An LBJ voiceover then declares, \u201cThese are the stakes. To make a world in which all of God\u2019s children can live, or to go into the dark. We must either love each other or we must die.\u201d\n\nThe spot aired only once, on September 7, 1964, during NBC\u2019s \u201cMonday Night at the Movies,\u201d and was met with some criticism, including from the Goldwater campaign. Johnson himself told his secretary of labor that the ad may have gone overboard.\n\n'Daisy' Ad Reaches 30-40 Americans\n\nUltimately, however, it proved effective at solidifying Goldwater\u2019s image as a warmonger. \u201cThey were taking his position on nuclear war and encasing it in concrete,\u201d Mann says. He adds that although polls didn\u2019t change much after the ad ran, it preempted any chance of a Goldwater comeback.\n\nMann estimates that roughly 30 million or 40 million Americans saw the \u201cDaisy\u201d ad the first time and that, thanks to replays on news broadcasts, upwards of 100 million Americans had viewed it by the end of the week. \u201cYou could penetrate the market in one showing in those days,\u201d Mann says, pointing out that there were only three TV channels. Today, he adds, \u201cyou\u2019d have to show it 1,000 times.\u201d\n\nDoyle Dane Bernbach produced several other ads for Johnson as well, including one featuring a little girl licking an ice cream cone as a female voiceover states: \u201cNow, children should have lots of vitamin A and calcium, but they shouldn\u2019t have any strontium-90 or cesium-137.\u201d The voiceover further proclaims that \u201cthere\u2019s a man who wants to be president of the United States \u2026 [and] he wants to go on testing more bombs,\u201d a reference to Goldwater\u2019s vote against the 1963 Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which barred nuclear weapons testing in the atmosphere, in outer space and underwater.\n\nA third nuclear-related ad, featuring a pregnant woman and her daughter, tacitly warned of the risks of birth defects from radioactive fallout, but was ultimately deemed too controversial to air at the time.\n\nLBJ Wins Election\n\nIn the end, Johnson succeeded in peeling off many moderate Republican voters and holding together the Democratic Party\u2019s so-called New Deal coalition. He won the election in a blowout, securing 61 percent of the popular vote and losing only Goldwater\u2019s home state of Arizona and five states in the South.\n\nThe Democrats also gained seats in Congress, giving Johnson a mandate to push forward with his war on poverty and the rest of his domestic agenda, collectively known as the Great Society. \u201cYou have a much-transformed Congress \u2026 that makes the Great Society possible,\u201d Germany says, though he notes that \u201cthe momentum that\u2019s there in \u201964 and \u201965 dissipates pretty rapidly\u201d as the Vietnam War heats up.\n\nSympathy generated from the JFK assassination, not the nuclear ads, was \u201cprobably the single most important issue in the massive Johnson landslide,\u201d Germany says.\n\nNonetheless, the memorable \u201cDaisy\u201d ad came to define the race, in addition to paving the way for myriad political attack ads to come. Mann, for his part, believes the spot was fair. \u201cTo a degree [Goldwater] was cheerleading for a nuclear war,\u201d Mann says. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s just monstrously reckless.\u201d",

To find your polling location, go to the state\u2019s Voter Portal and select Voting Location, or contact your county election board.\n\n\n\nFor ballot information, visit the state\u2019s Voter Portal and select Who\u2019s On The Ballot.\n\n\n\n\n\nVoter ID requirements on Election Day\n\nWhen voting in person, you must present an approved form of photo ID, such as an Indiana driver\u2019s license, Indiana photo ID card, military ID or U.S. passport. Some exemptions exist for voters who have a religious objection to being photographed or live in a state-licensed facility (such as a nursing home) that also serves as their polling place.\n\n\n\nIf you forget your ID, you can cast a provisional ballot and have until noon on Friday, Nov. 15, to verify your identity with your county election board.\n\n\n\n\n\nVoting with a disability\n\nVoters with disabilities can vote absentee-by-mail. If you need assistance voting, visit the state\u2019s Absentee Voting web page for more information on who can assist and how.\n\n\n\nVoters with print disabilities \u2014 those unable to independently mark a paper ballot due to blindness, low vision or a physical disability that impairs manual dexterity \u2014 may request electronic absentee ballots for all elections.\n\n\n\nAll Indiana polling locations are equipped with accessible voting systems. If you need assistance at the polls, you may receive help from two poll workers (one from each major political party) or a person of your choice, as long as that person is not your employer, union officer or agent of your employer or union. Assistants must complete an Affidavit of Voter Assistance at the Polls at the polling station before entering the voting booth.\n\n\n\nIndiana offers absentee voting by travel board for some voters, such as nursing home residents, where a bipartisan team delivers the voter\u2019s ballot and assists the person with completing their ballot. Those who are confined due to illness or injury, or who believe their polling place is not accessible to them, plus others, can apply. More information is available on the state\u2019s Absentee Voting web page.\n\n\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This guide was originally published Jan. 10, 2024, and updated with new information about voting in the 2024 elections.\n\n\n\nGrace Dickinson is a writer for aarp.org who covers federal and state policy.

        "text": "Will U.S. Foreign Policy Play a Decisive Role in the Fall Presidential Election?\nProf. Mietek Boduszy\u0144ski\n\nMietek Boduszy\u0144ski is associate professor of politics at Pomona College with expertise in U.S. foreign policy and democracy movements around the world. Before coming to Pomona, Boduszy\u0144ski was a diplomat with the U.S. Department of State, serving in Iraq, Libya, Egypt, Japan, Kosovo and Albania. During an academic leave in 2022-23, he was a policy advisor for the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy at the Pentagon. This is the second in an occasional series with Pomona faculty about election issues.\n\nWhat is at stake in the fall Presidential election?\n\nAmerica\u2019s role in the world will be on the ballot in November 2024. One candidate, President Joe Biden, supports a traditional leadership role for the United States in upholding a \u201crules-based world order.\u201d His opponent, former President Donald Trump, champions an \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy that seeks to lessen U.S. involvement overseas and compel other countries to take on more of the burden in areas such as collective security. The choice before voters is therefore a stark and consequential one. Many observers predict that in a second term, Trump would almost certainly seek to overcome the kind of bureaucratic obstructionism that checked certain isolationist impulses during his first term in office and pursue \u201cAmerica First\u201d with much greater resolve.\n\nWhat do you see as motivating American isolationism?\n\nForeign policy isolationism has been on the rise for a while now and is represented in parts of both the Republican and Democratic parties. Republicans in particular have grown doubtful about the value of continued U.S. engagement overseas. A Chicago Council survey found in September 2023 that, for the first time ever, a majority of Republicans think the United States should stay out of world affairs rather than play an active role. But it is notable that President Biden chose to hold on to some of his predecessor\u2019s \u201cisolationist\u201d policies such as protectionist trade measures. This is because they are widely understood to be popular and attract working- and middle-class voters.\n\nBut the data also show that Republicans who want to stay out of world affairs do not differ so much from those who prefer active engagement when it comes to issues such as the rise of China or immigration policy. And we have seen that when push came to shove, most Congressional Republicans supported continued aid to Ukraine. There has also been much bipartisan agreement on the need to aggressively counter China\u2014witness the bill attempting to force the sale of TikTok.\n\nWhat other divides are you seeing in views on foreign policy?\n\nThe regional differences are stark as well. A 2023 Carnegie Endowment survey found that nearly four in five Californians believe international engagement is important to American security and prosperity. And we have witnessed students at Pomona and universities across the country mobilizing in support of the Palestinian cause and in opposition to traditional U.S. support of Israel. This suggests a new interest in foreign policy among the younger generation\u2014as well as a deepening generational divide on one of the most vexing conflicts in the world. Yet the latest polls suggest that the larger population of Gen Z voters care much less about Israel-Gaza\u2014and indeed much less about foreign policy more generally\u2014than they care about the economy.\n\nSo, will foreign policy play a decisive role in November?\n\nIn short, the picture is somewhat complicated. The conventional wisdom is that presidents can\u2019t win on foreign policy, unless the country is at war, but they can certainly lose on it. In the wake of the problematic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan\u2014albeit one supported by many Americans\u2014President Biden\u2019s response to the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine has been admirable. He has rallied America\u2019s allies and strengthened NATO. And objectively speaking, the Russian invasion of Ukraine is the most significant threat to the international order. Unfortunately for Biden, the Ukraine war no longer commands public attention, and as the conventional wisdom suggests, Biden probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to win just on that foreign policy success alone in any event. Biden\u2019s perceived mishandling of the Israel-Gaza war, as noted above, is a major issue for some of his core voters in critical swing states. These voters are unlikely to prefer Trump, but they may not vote at all. If large enough numbers in states such as Michigan do make the choice to stay home, the second half of the conventional wisdom\u2014that presidents can lose on foreign policy\u2014may be confirmed.",

        "text": "North Macedonia's right-wing opposition scores victory in elections\nNorth Macedonia elected its first woman president Wednesday as the ruling Social Democratic Union of Macedonia suffered historic losses in presidential and parliamentary elections.\n\nWith nearly all the votes counted, university professor Gordana Siljanovska-Davkova, the presidential candidate of the right-wing VMRO-DPMNE opposition party, won nearly 65% of the vote, with incumbent President Stevo Pendarovski winning 29%, according to the country\u2019s State Election Commission.\n\nIn the parliamentary contest, the VMRO-DPMNE-led coalition Your Macedonia won 43% of the votes, giving it 58 of the parliament\u2019s 120 seats, just short of a majority.\n\nAlthough it was uncertain on election day whether the 40% turnout threshold for the presidential election would be reached, due to calls for a boycott, the State Election Commission reported that turnout exceeded 46%.\n\nIn her first post-election public address, President-elect Siljanovska-Davkova promised to \u201cact as the president of all citizens, of all ethnic groups, of party members, of those who are not in parties, because a president, especially not if she is a woman, cannot unite and search for unity if he sticks to party lines.\u201d\n\nVMRO-DPMNE party head Hristijan Mickoski called the election results a \u201chistoric victory for North Macedonia and the people of Macedonia,\u201d adding that the ruling Social Democratic Union, or SDSM, lost because of \"crime, corruption, incompetence, false values, the confiscated state, tenders, nepotism and a hundred other consequences that made the state suffer and the people disappointed.\"\n\nSDSM officials have repeatedly rejected these criticisms.\n\nSDSM head Dimitar Kovacevski congratulated the victors Wednesday while telling reporters that his party\u2019s loss was \u201cdisappointing\u201d and \u201ca heavy blow.\u201d\n\nEU and NATO considerations\n\nThe country agreed to change its name from the Republic of Macedonia to the Republic of North Macedonia in 2019 following a decadeslong dispute with Greece over the designation.\n\nIn a 2018 referendum, voters in North Macedonia approved an agreement with Greece that included changing the country\u2019s name in order to clear the way for its European Union and NATO accession. However, turnout for the referendum was less than the 50% threshold required to validate the results, leaving parliament to approve the change.\n\nMickoski has refused to acknowledge the country\u2019s name change and the 2018 agreement with Greece. The opposition also supports standing firm in ongoing linguistic and historical disputes with neighboring Bulgaria, an EU member that has blocked North Macedonia\u2019s EU accession negotiations.\n\nEU membership negotiations with North Macedonia \u2014 and fellow-candidate Albania \u2014 began in 2022, and the process is expected to take years.\n\nCommenting Wednesday on North Macedonia\u2019s elections and their potential effect on the country\u2019s EU accession bid, Deputy U.S. Assistant Secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs Gabriel Escobar said, \u201cI am confident and hope that regardless of the elections in North Macedonia, the road to Europe will continue.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, European Commission spokesperson Ana Pisonero told reporters in Brussels that \u201cNorth Macedonia has committed itself to constitutional changes and, from our perspective, we believe that all political forces will focus on progress in the EU integration process.\"\n\nPisonero added: \u201cThe European Council has clearly stated what the expectations are and we, for our part, fully support the perspective of North Macedonia's membership in the EU, and we hope that we will be able to open the negotiation process as soon as possible.\"\n\nCorruption is an issue\n\nThe European Commission reported in November that corruption, another hot-button issue, \u201cremains prevalent in many areas\u201d of North Macedonia.\n\nIn December, U.S. Ambassador to North Macedonia Angela Aggeler said there was \u201can epidemic of corruption in this country that has affected every sector, every organization, and only by exposing the corrupt actors can we begin to help the country address these issues.\u201d\n\nThe VMRO-DPMNE has accused the SDSM and its junior coalition partner, the Democratic Union for Integration, the third-largest political party and largest ethnic Albanian political party, of causing a \u201ccorruption pandemic.\u201d\n\nWednesday was the third time that Macedonian citizens in the U.S. and elsewhere outside North Macedonia voted in the country\u2019s presidential elections.\n\nAccording to the State Election Commission, more than 2,300 domestic and international observers monitored the voting.",

        "text": "Trump has yet to decide his VP pick \u2013 and it\u2019s turning into a pageant of its own\nHello there, and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s brand new US election newsletter. I hope you\u2019re having a nice week.\n\nIt\u2019s less than six months until election day, and Donald Trump, when he\u2019s not in court or looking at racing cars, is spending time weighing his vice-presidential pick. It\u2019s becoming quite the spectacle.\n\nBut first, some of the happenings in US politics.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know \u2026\n\n1. I don\u2019t feel so good\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s trial over hush-money payments to an adult film star saw Stormy Daniels recall her sexual encounter with the president in front of a presumably nauseous Manhattan courtroom. Will this trial \u2013 and the three others he faces \u2013 torpedo Trump\u2019s election chances? One poll this week found that it will depend on whether he is convicted. About 80% of Trump\u2019s supporters would definitely stick with him if he becomes a felon, while 16% would \u201creconsider\u201d their support. Just 4% say they would definitely ditch him.\n\n2. Biden gives antisemitism speech\n\nIn a speech on Tuesday at a Holocaust remembrance event, Joe Biden condemned what he called the \u201cferocious surge of antisemitism in America and around the world\u201d, amid widespread student protests over American support for Israel\u2019s war on Gaza. Thousands of students have been arrested around the US, during a frequently militaristic police response. Republicans have tried to use the unrest to paint Biden as weak and sow division among Democratic voters.\n\n3. TikTok hits back after US government crackdown\n\nTikTok and its parent company are suing the US government after Biden signed bipartisan legislation which could potentially ban the app from the US if it is not sold to another owner. It comes as Russian state-affiliated accounts have used TikTok to draw attention to Biden\u2019s age and immigration policies. Critics have said ByteDance, TikTok\u2019s China-based parent company, could also collect sensitive information about Americans. But others \u2013 including TikTok \u2013 say the US is unfairly singling out the social media platform, potentially hurting free speech and independent content makers. The debacle is fraught in an election year when many young people get news from TikTok, and Biden himself has a campaign account.\n\nEeny, meeny, miny, moe\n\nView image in fullscreen Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago in November 2022. Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters\n\nThe election is in November, and Donald Trump has yet to decide on his vice-presidential candidate. That\u2019s not unusual \u2013 assuming he\u2019s not in prison by then, he\u2019s got plenty of time \u2013 but what is kind of new is the very public auditioning for the role.\n\nTrump summoned several of the candidates to Mar-a-Lago over the weekend, where he forced them to parade around on stage, in what sounds like a version of the Miss Universe competition he used to haunt.\n\nBut the contenders, who range from long-time sycophants to more recent converts, have been doing some parading of their own.\n\nMarco Rubio, the Florida senator who ran for president against Trump in 2016 (Trump dubbed him \u201cLittle Marco\u201d, Rubio suggested Trump had a small penis, but the two have since made up) has been near-ever present on TV in recent weeks, as has Elise Stefanik, a New York congresswoman who was once seen as a sober legislator, but has since evolved into a Trump disciple.\n\nDoug Burgum \u2013 recently dubbed \u201cless interesting than a wooden post\u201d \u2013 and Tim Scott, who both ran against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination this year, have also been showing up on TV shows to defend Trump\u2019s legal entanglements and threats to undermine the election.\n\nThere\u2019s also JD Vance, a big-faced beardy man who once believed Trump to be an \u201cidiot\u201d but has since changed his mind, and Byron Donalds, who with Scott is one of the five Black Republicans in Congress.\n\nOne thing appears to be certain: it will not be Kristi Noem, the South Dakota governor who has dominated headlines after admitting that she shot and killed her dog in a gravel pit.\n\nWill the identity of Trump\u2019s running mate really make a difference?\n\nIn 2016, Trump was viewed with suspicion by some evangelical voters \u2013 voters he needed to come out in droves for him to defeat Hillary Clinton. That\u2019s why he chose Mike Pence, a devout Christian who just released a book that is literally called So Help Me God.\n\nBut religious Republicans have pretty much made their peace with Trump since then \u2013 largely because the supreme court he appointed overturned the federal right to abortion.\n\nReports indicate that what Trump is really looking for is an uber-loyal attack dog, someone who can tear into Trump\u2019s critics on air, before coming back to the White House to quietly snuggle at his feet.\n\nIt would be easy to see a vice-president as inconsequential. But since the US became a thing, nine vice-presidents have stepped into the top job: eight times because the sitting president died, and once because the president \u2013 Richard Nixon \u2013 resigned. Without wanting to be too macabre, Donald Trump is quite old, and is not known as a healthy eater. (In the name of Journalism I once lived like Trump for a week. I genuinely think it took years off my life.)\n\nAnyway: some of these people might fancy their chances of ascending to the throne.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Nick Hagen/EPA\n\nA dispatch from our Washington bureau chief, David Smith:\n\nIs it a bird? Is it a plane? OK, it\u2019s a plane, with \u201cTRUMP\u201d written in giant gold letters on the side. I watched the Boeing 757 dubbed \u201cTrump Force One\u201d fly into Freeland, Michigan, last week, accompanied by the booming soundtrack of Tom Cruise\u2019s Top Gun.\n\nIt reminded me that the Trump Show has always been about reality versus fantasy. Reality for Trump right now is hour after hour sitting in a cold, dingy New York courtroom. Fantasy is stepping out of his private jet into afternoon sunshine and the warm glow of a campaign rally where the crowd chants his name.\n\nThe demographics were telling: overwhelmingly white and dominated by retirees. Every Trump supporter I interviewed is convinced that the trial in New York is a witch-hunt designed to hobble his election chances. When I asked about his dictatorial ambitions, they brushed the question aside and preferred the word \u201cleader\u201d.\n\nWho had the worst week?\n\nView image in fullscreen In this courtroom sketch, Stormy Daniels testifies on the witness stand. Photograph: Elizabeth Williams/AP\n\nOn Monday Judge Juan Merchan, handling Trump\u2019s hush-money payments trial, said he \u201cwill have to consider a jail sanction\u201d if Trump doesn\u2019t stop publicly criticizing witnesses and the jury. But if Monday was bad for Trump, Tuesday was worse.\n\n\u201cI had my clothes and my shoes off, I believe my bra, however, was still on. We were in the missionary position \u2026\u201d so went the testimony of Stormy Daniels, who was allegedly paid $130,000 to remain quiet about the claimed encounter, which she says took place in 2006, a year after Trump married his wife Melania. (Trump denies having sex with Daniels.)\n\nDaniels said that Trump told her she reminded him of Ivanka Trump, his daughter, before the two became intimate. Asked by the prosecution whether the encounter with Trump was \u201cbrief\u201d, Daniels said: \u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u2018It\u2019s my favorite book\u2019\n\nView image in fullscreen Donald Trump is selling an edition of the Bible. Composite: Guardian Design\n\nI spent no short amount of time last week reading the God Bless the USA Bible, a special version of the holy text Trump is hawking online. If you enjoy the Bible, but feel like it is missing images of American flags and bald eagles, then this is the book for you.\n\nIf, however, you want a Bible without sticky pages, which hasn\u2019t been dubbed \u201cblasphemous\u201d, and which doesn\u2019t cost $60, then maybe give it a pass.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nElsewhere in US politics\n\nView image in fullscreen Claire Woodall-Vogg, executive director of the City of Milwaukee election commission, teaches a class to poll workers in October 2022.

Biden won Wisconsin by just 20,000 votes in 2020.\n\nBernie Sanders won more than 13m votes in the 2016 presidential primary, as his brand of democratic socialism inspired young people across the country. He didn\u2019t win, of course, but Martin Pengelly reports that Sanders plans to run for re-election to the Senate.",

        "text": "Chad\u2019s President Deby wins election against prime minister in heated race\nViolence and questions of election-rigging, however, marred the provisional vote tally, which was announced earlier than expected.\n\nMilitary leader Mahamat Idriss Deby has won a closely watched presidential election in Chad, according to provisional results released by its National Election Management Agency.\n\nDeby secured more than 61 percent of the vote, according to the numbers released on Thursday, eliminating the need for a run-off with his closest rival, Prime Minister Succes Masra, who received 18.5 percent.\n\nThe victory allows Deby to hold onto the presidency in the central African country with a voter mandate.\n\nPreviously, he led the country as its interim president, seizing power after his father, the late President Idriss Deby, was killed in April 2021 while fighting a rebel group in the north of the country.\n\nBut his rival in the presidential race, Masra, has already indicated he will not accept the election results.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Masra issued a live broadcast on Facebook declaring himself the winner. He also accused Deby and other government officials of rigging the election results to hold onto power.\n\n\u201cA small number of individuals believe they can make people believe that the election was won by the same system that has been ruling Chad for decades,\u201d Masra said.\n\nDeby\u2019s father had led the country for more than 30 years, from 1990 to 2021, when he was shot to death shortly after his sixth presidential victory.\n\nCritics have accused both him and now his son of stifling the opposition to maintain their grip on power.\n\nThey have also pointed to circumstances leading up to the May 6 presidential vote that could have swayed its outcome.\n\nFor instance, one of the leading opposition figures, Deby\u2019s cousin Yaya Dillo, was killed when security forces engaged in a shootout at his party headquarters.\n\nOther opposition figures have been barred from running over \u201cirregularities\u201d in their applications to campaign.\n\nOn Thursday, Masra called on his supporters and security forces to back his claim to the presidency and reject the election agency\u2019s results.\n\n\u201cTo all Chadians who voted for change, who voted for me, I say: mobilise. Do it calmly, with a spirit of peace,\u201d he said in his Facebook broadcast.\n\nThursday\u2019s results came earlier than expected, as the provisional results were originally thought to arrive on May 21.\n\nChad is considered the first of the military-led countries in Africa\u2019s Sahel region to hold a democratic election, though questions about the vote\u2019s fairness and credibility have endured.\n\nNearby countries like Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso have weathered coups that have left military leaders in charge of their governments, too. Eight coups have struck the region since 2020 alone.\n\nThis month\u2019s presidential race was also the first time in the country\u2019s history that an incumbent faced his prime minister in the polls.\n\nUpon taking office in 2021, Deby pledged to hold \u201cfree and democratic elections\u201d within 18 months \u2013 but his government extended the transition period until 2024, allowing Deby to remain in office in the interim.\n\nDuring that time, he led a referendum on a new constitution that allowed him to mount his 2024 election bid.\n\nA lifelong soldier, Deby led the powerful DGSSIE, an acronym for the General Direction of the Security Services of State Institutions. In that role, he worked closely with French troops.\n\nHome to nearly 18 million people, Chad was under French colonial rule until 1960, and it remains the last country in the Sahel region to have a French military presence, with warplanes and troops stationed there.\n\nIn the wake of Thursday\u2019s announcement, security forces were stationed at intersections throughout the capital of N\u2019Djamena, in case of unrest.",

        "text": "Trump promised to scrap climate laws if US oil bosses donated $1bn \u2013 report\nDonald Trump dangled a brazen \u201cdeal\u201d in front of some of the top US oil bosses last month, proposing that they give him $1bn for his White House re-election campaign and vowing that once back in office he would instantly tear up Joe Biden\u2019s environmental regulations and prevent any new ones, according to a bombshell new report.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, the former US president made his jaw-dropping pitch, which the paper described as \u201cremarkably blunt and transactional\u201d, at a dinner at his Mar-a-Lago home and club.\n\nIn front of more than 20 executives, including from Chevron, Exxon and Occidental Petroleum, he promised to increase oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, remove hurdles to drilling in the Alaskan Arctic, and reverse new rules designed to cut car pollution. He would also overturn the Biden administration\u2019s decision in January to pause new natural gas export permits which have been denounced as \u201cclimate bombs\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get it on the first day,\u201d Trump said, according to the Post, citing an unnamed dinner attendee.\n\nTrump\u2019s exhortation to the oil executives that they were wealthy enough to pour $1bn into his campaign war-chest, at the same time pledging a U-turn on Biden\u2019s efforts to combat the climate crisis, was immediately denounced on Wednesday by environmental groups.\n\n\u201c$1bn for Trump, a devastating climate future for the rest of us,\u201d said Pete Maysmith of the League of Conservation Voters (LCV).\n\nChristina Polizzi of Climate Power told the Guardian that Trump was \u201cputting the future of the planet up for sale\u201d.\n\n\u201cHe is in the pocket of big oil \u2013 he gave them $25bn in tax breaks in his first term \u2013 and now it\u2019s clear he is willing to do whatever big oil wants in a potential second term.\u201d\n\nThe former president\u2019s exchange with fossil fuel giants also engaged the concern of groups monitoring the influence of money in politics. Jordan Libowitz of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics (Crew), a non-partisan government watchdog, said the conversation, as reported by the Post, \u201ccertainly looks a lot like quid pro quo\u201d.\n\nLibowitz said the encounter was \u201cabout as blatant as I\u2019ve ever seen. Politicians often give a nudge and a wink, they don\u2019t say raise a billion dollars for me and I\u2019ll get rid of the regulations that you want.\u201d\n\nHe added that Crew\u2019s legal team were looking into whether this rises to the high legal standard of bribery.\n\nTrump\u2019s close relations to the oil industry, and his hostility to federal regulations designed to reduce emissions that exacerbate the climate crisis, are well-known and longstanding. With six months to go until the presidential election, however, he is stepping up his efforts to attract campaign donations from the sector.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Trump on Trial Free newsletter Stay up to date on all of Donald Trump\u2019s trials.

Having all but certainly secured the Republican nomination, Trump is often narrowly ahead of Joe Biden in surveys of the presidential race, including performing strongly in the key swing states that are vital to any candidate\u2019s chances of victory. Trump\u2019s solid performance comes despite a swath of legal woes, including currently being on trial in New York over an alleged hush-money payment to the adult film star Stormy Daniels.\n\nFor their part, executives in big oil companies have been preparing for a possible Trump second term by drafting executive orders designed to be ready to sign as soon as he returns to office. Politico reported this week that the executives have clubbed together to produce off-the-shelf policies on increasing natural gas exports, supercharging drilling and extending offshore oil leases.\n\nThe interplay between Trump and the oil giants as the election approaches underlines the vast gulf between the former president and the current occupant of the White House. According to an analysis by a group of environmental groups including the Sierra Club and LCV, the Biden administration has taken more than 300 actions towards greater public health and clean energy, more than any other administration in US history.\n\nThose measures included the first major climate legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act, which has propelled record investment in clean energy including solar and wind and increased sales of electric vehicles. US energy emissions are slowly declining, by some 3% this year.\n\nEven so, the US is extracting more oil and gas than ever, reaching almost 13m barrels of crude oil a day \u2013 more than double the production levels a decade ago.",

        "text": "Growing Partisan Divisions Over NATO and Ukraine\nMany Americans say the influence of China, Russia and Iran is rising; increasing shares see U.S. and European nations as in decline\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden shakes hands with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy following the G7 nations\u2019 joint declaration for support of Ukraine on July 12, 2023, in Vilnius, Lithuania. (Sean Gallup/Getty Images)\n\nHow we did this Pew Research Center conducted this study to understand Americans\u2019 opinions of NATO, Russia and the war between Russia and Ukraine. For this analysis, we surveyed 3,600 U.S. adults from April 1 to April 7, 2024. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology. Here are the questions used for this analysis, along with responses, and its methodology.\n\nAs NATO approaches its 75th anniversary, Americans are increasingly divided in their views about the alliance. Most continue to believe the United States benefits from its membership, but partisan differences on ratings of NATO have widened in recent years.\n\nThree-quarters of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents rate the organization favorably, while only 43% of Republicans and Republican leaners agree \u2013 down from 55% in a 2022 survey conducted soon after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAttitudes toward the war in Ukraine have evolved to reflect the partisan polarization found across so many issues in U.S. politics. Democrats and Republicans differ sharply on views about aid to Ukraine, ratings of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and whether supporting Ukraine helps or hurts U.S. interests.\n\nThe share of Americans who believe the U.S. is not providing enough support to Ukraine has risen slightly in recent months, following setbacks for Ukraine on the battlefield and prolonged congressional debate over sending aid. (The survey was conducted before President Joe Biden signed into law an aid package sending nearly $61 billion to the Ukrainian war effort.)\n\nRoughly one-quarter of Americans (24%) now say the U.S. is not providing enough aid, up from 18% in November 2023, when we last asked this question. Still, more Americans (31%) think the U.S. is providing too much aid, and 25% believe it\u2019s giving the right amount.\n\nHowever, views on this issue vary considerably by party. While the share of Democrats who believe the U.S. is not doing enough to help Ukraine declined after the initial onset of the war, it has increased more recently. Currently, 36% of Democrats say the U.S. is not providing enough aid.\n\nIn contrast, just 13% of Republicans say the U.S. is not giving enough support to Ukraine, while 49% believe it is giving too much. At the beginning of the war, Republican attitudes were essentially the reverse: 49% said the U.S. was not providing enough aid and 9% said it was providing too much. Among Republicans, conservatives are more likely than moderates and liberals to say the U.S. is providing too much aid to Ukraine.\n\nIn addition to shifting views about NATO and Ukraine over the past few years, Americans have increasingly come to believe that U.S. power is declining on the global stage: 54% say the country\u2019s influence has been getting weaker recently, up from 47% two years ago. The shares saying the same about the United Kingdom, France and Germany \u2013 key U.S. allies in Europe \u2013 have also increased since 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, about four-in-ten or more see China, Russia and Iran \u2013 nations often considered adversaries of the U.S. \u2013 as increasingly influential, including a 71% majority who say this of China. And about a third say India\u2019s influence is getting stronger.\n\nRepublicans are more likely than Democrats to believe China, Russia and Iran are gaining strength. They are also more likely to believe the U.S., France and Germany are becoming weaker.\n\nThese are among the findings from a Pew Research Center survey conducted April 1-7, 2024, among 3,600 U.S. adults.\n\nBelow we describe some of the key findings from the survey, which explored attitudes toward NATO, Ukraine, trans-Atlantic relations, Russia and the shifting balance of power in global politics. For more in-depth analysis of these topics, read:\n\nUkraine\n\nThere is no public consensus on whether supporting Ukraine is in America\u2019s national interests: 36% say it helps U.S. national security, 36% say it hurts and 24% believe it has no impact. Democrats are particularly likely to think it helps, while Republicans are especially likely to say it hurts.\n\nConcerns about Russia defeating Ukraine and Russia invading other countries in the region are higher today than in September 2022, the last time we asked this question. These concerns are more common among Democrats than Republicans.\n\nOpinions about Zelenskyy also divide sharply along partisan lines. A 55% majority of Republicans now lack confidence in Zelenskyy to do the right thing in world affairs, up from 48% a year ago. In contrast, 65% of Democrats say they are confident in the Ukrainian leader, although this is down from 71% in 2023.\n\nNATO and trans-Atlantic relations\n\nIn addition to partisan divisions over NATO, there are also substantial differences by education. For instance, 73% of Americans with a postgraduate degree have a favorable view of NATO, compared with just 51% of those with a high school degree or less education.\n\nHow much do Americans know about NATO? Read the results of our NATO knowledge quiz.\n\n66% of Americans believe the U.S. benefits a great deal or fair amount from being a NATO member; 51% of Republicans hold this view, compared with 81% of Democrats.\n\nMajorities of Americans have favorable views of the UK (70%), France (64%) and Germany (64%); Democrats are more likely than Republicans to see these key U.S. allies positively.\n\nLarge majorities of both Democrats and Republicans believe economic and trade ties, security and defense ties, and shared democratic values are important for strong relations between the U.S. and Europe. However, while 45% of Democrats believe shared democratic values are very important, only about a third of Republicans (31%) say the same.\n\nDespite overall positive views of European allies and the nature of trans-Atlantic relations, roughly half of U.S. adults (47%) say European allies need to increase their defense spending. Older Americans and conservative Republicans are particularly likely to believe this.\n\nRussia\n\nAmericans became significantly more likely to consider Russia an enemy after the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. In January 2022, 41% considered Russia an enemy of the U.S.; two months later, 70% held this view. Today, roughly six-in-ten (61%) see Russia as an enemy.\n\nCompared with the other issues in this study, partisan divisions over Russia are relatively muted. Democrats (67%) are more likely to describe Russia as an enemy, but most Republicans (58%) share this view. In 2022, these partisan differences were not as wide.\n\nAttitudes toward Russian President Vladimir Putin remain extremely negative among Americans: 88% say they do not have confidence in him to do the right thing in world affairs.\n\nA shifting balance of global power\n\nSince 2022, Americans have become more likely to believe China, India and Russia are growing stronger in world affairs. In contrast, they have become more likely to say France, Germany, the UK and the U.S. are losing influence on the world stage.\n\nTwo-thirds of Republicans think the U.S. is losing influence; 44% of Democrats agree. The share of each partisan group who say U.S. influence is declining has increased since 2022.\n\nLarge majorities in both parties believe China\u2019s power is rising, although Republicans (78%) are somewhat more likely than Democrats (68%) to hold this view.\n\nInternational engagement and foreign policy issues\n\nMany questions on the survey correlate with general views about international engagement. For example, 56% of those who think it\u2019s best for the U.S. to be active in world affairs say supporting Ukraine helps American national security. That share is just 17% among those who say the U.S. should pay less attention to problems in other countries and concentrate on domestic problems.\n\nRelated: What Are Americans\u2019 Top Foreign Policy Priorities?",

        "text": "Biden says he will stop sending bombs and artillery shells to Israel if it launches major invasion of Rafah\nRacine, Wisconsin CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Joe Biden said for the first time Wednesday he would halt some shipments of American weapons to Israel \u2013 which he acknowledged have been used to kill civilians in Gaza \u2013 if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu orders a major invasion of the city of Rafah.\n\n\u201cCivilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs and other ways in which they go after population centers,\u201d Biden told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett in an exclusive interview on \u201cErin Burnett OutFront,\u201d referring to 2,000-pound bombs that Biden paused shipments of last week.\n\n\u201cI made it clear that if they go into Rafah \u2013 they haven\u2019t gone in Rafah yet \u2013 if they go into Rafah, I\u2019m not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities \u2013 that deal with that problem,\u201d Biden said.\n\nThe president\u2019s announcement that he was prepared to condition American weaponry on Israel\u2019s actions amounts to a turning point in the seven-month conflict between Israel and Hamas. And his acknowledgement that American bombs had been used to kill civilians in Gaza was a stark recognition of the United States\u2019 role in the war.\n\nThe president has come under extraordinary pressure, including from members of his own party, to limit shipments of arms amid a humanitarian crisis in Gaza.\n\nUntil now, the president had resisted those calls and strongly supported Israel\u2019s efforts to go after Hamas. Yet a looming invasion of Rafah, the city in southern Gaza where more than a million Palestinian civilians have been sheltering, appears to have shifted the president\u2019s calculus.\n\nA Palestinian man watches smoke rise following Israeli strikes in the eastern part of Rafah on May 7. Hatem Khaled/Reuters\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not walking away from Israel\u2019s security. We\u2019re walking away from Israel\u2019s ability to wage war in those areas,\u201d Biden said.\n\nBiden said while the US would continue to provide defensive weapons to Israel, including for its Iron Dome air defense system, other shipments would end should a major ground invasion of Rafah begin.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to make sure Israel is secure in terms of Iron Dome and their ability to respond to attacks that came out of the Middle East recently,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s, it\u2019s just wrong. We\u2019re not going to \u2013 we\u2019re not going to supply the weapons and artillery shells.\u201d\n\nAlready, the US has paused a shipment of \u201chigh-payload munitions\u201d due to Israel\u2019s possible operations in Rafah without a plan for the civilians there, according to the Pentagon, though it said a final decision on that shipment hadn\u2019t been made. The administration has said it is reviewing the potential sale or transfer of other munitions.\n\nIsraeli officials privately expressed to US officials \u201cdeep frustration\u201d on the pause in shipments as well as the US media briefings on the decision, according to a source briefed on the matter.\n\nA potential rift\n\nBiden\u2019s public linking of American weapons shipments to Israel\u2019s conduct could widen a rift between himself and Netanyahu, with whom he spoke by phone on Monday. That conversation came as Israel ordered the evacuation of tens of thousands of civilians from Rafah and launched strikes near border areas of the city.\n\nBiden said Israel\u2019s actions in Rafah had not yet crossed a red line of entering heavily populated zones, even if their actions had caused tensions in the region.\n\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t gone into the population centers. What they did is right on the border. And it\u2019s causing problems with, right now, in terms of \u2013 with Egypt, which I\u2019ve worked very hard to make sure we have a relationship and help,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said he had conveyed to Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders that American support for operations in population centers was limited.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made it clear to Bibi and the war cabinet: They\u2019re not going to get our support, if in fact they go on these population centers,\u201d he said.\n\nLater, Biden described warning Netanyahu about the risks of becoming bogged down in Gaza, drawing parallels to the American experience in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\n\u201cI said to Bibi, \u2018Don\u2019t make the same mistake we made in America. We wanted to get bin Laden. We\u2019ll help you get Sinwar,\u2019\u201d he said, referring to the Hamas leader in Gaza. \u201cIt made sense to get bin Laden; it made no sense to try and unify Afghanistan. It made no sense in my view to engage in thinking that in Iraq they had a nuclear weapon.\u201d\n\nThe conflict in the Middle East has consumed much of Biden\u2019s time over the past months, even as he works to promote his domestic record to American voters. His strong support for Israel has generated protests and anger, including on college campuses and at his events, where signs have labeled him \u201cGenocide Joe.\u201d\n\nAsked about the demonstrations, Biden said Wednesday: \u201cAbsolutely, I hear the message.\u201d\n\nBut he warned against protests that veer into hate speech or antisemitism.\n\n\u201cThere is a legitimate right to free speech and protest. There\u2019s a legitimate right to do that, and they have a right to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there\u2019s not a legitimate right to use hate speech. There\u2019s not a legitimate right to threaten Jewish students. There is not a legitimate right to block people\u2019s access to class. That\u2019s against the law.\u201d\n\nBiden fights economic perceptions\n\nBiden was speaking Wednesday in Racine, Wisconsin, where he\u2019d just promoted new economic investments that could result in thousands of new jobs.\n\nIn the CNN interview, he sought to reframe perceptions of the American economy, touting strong job growth and efforts to combat corporate greed while questioning surveys showing voters still pessimistic about the country\u2019s direction.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already turned it around,\u201d Biden said, responding to a question on whether, less than six months before Election Day, he was running short on time to improve his standing among Americans on his handling of the economy.\n\nBiden pointed to surveys showing many Americans view their own economic situation favorably, even as they look negatively on the nationwide economy.\n\n\u201cThe polling data has been wrong all along,\u201d he said, questioning the effectiveness of phone surveys.\n\nAnd he said his own record on job creation following the Covid-19 pandemic was as clear an indication as any that conditions had markedly improved for American workers.\n\n\u201cThe idea that we\u2019re in a situation where things are so bad that folks \u2013 I mean, we\u2019ve created more jobs. We\u2019re in a situation where people have access to good paying jobs,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden speaks about his Investing in America agenda, at Gateway Technical College in Sturtevant, Wisconsin, on May 8, 2024. Biden is highlighting a major investment by Microsoft in Racine, Wisconsin, a city on the shores of Lake Michigan, as part of the president's plan of \"growing the economy from the middle-out and bottom-up,\" the White House said. Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nStill, he acknowledged there were good reasons for Americans to worry, including the cost of goods and housing.\n\n\u201cThe last I saw, the combination of the inflation, the cost of inflation, all those things, that\u2019s really worrisome to people, with good reason,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m working very hard to bring the cost of rentals down, to increase the number of homes that are available,\u201d he went on. \u201cLet me say it this way \u2013 when I started this administration, people were saying there\u2019s going to be a collapse to the economy. We have the strongest economy in the world. Let me say it again \u2013 in the world.\u201d\n\nBiden has spent much of the last year working to promote his economic accomplishments, including new investments made possible by infrastructure and manufacturing legislation.\n\nThat includes in Wisconsin, where he spoke Wednesday at a site where his predecessor Donald Trump once promoted an investment by the Taiwan-based electronics giant Foxconn that later failed.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s never succeeded in creating jobs, and I\u2019ve never failed,\u201d Biden said in the interview, adding later: \u201cWhen has he even done anything he said? I\u2019m not being facetious. Think about it.\u201d\n\nFull Interview: Biden sits down for an exclusive interview with CNN\n\nLooking ahead to November\n\nBiden voiced little concern about his reelection prospects in the interview. But he warned Trump was unlikely to accept the results of the election if he loses.\n\n\u201cI promise you he won\u2019t,\u201d Biden said, \u201cwhich is dangerous.\u201d\n\nAsked what advice his former boss, President Barack Obama, had provided in their conversations about the race, Biden said it was simply to \u201ckeep doing what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m feeling good about the trajectory of the campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you know as well I do, most people don\u2019t really focus and make up their minds until the fall. There\u2019s a lot going on, and we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\n\nBut surveys have shown voters giving Biden little credit for his economic record.\n\nIn CNN\u2019s most recent poll, Biden\u2019s approval ratings for the economy (34%) and inflation (29%) remain starkly negative, as voters say economic concerns are more important to them when choosing a candidate than they were in each of the past two presidential contests.\n\nBiden said on Wednesday that \u201cno president has had the run we\u2019ve had in terms of creating jobs and bringing down inflation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was 9% when I came to office. 9%. But look, people have a right to be concerned. Ordinary people.\u201d\n\nInflation actually peaked at 9.1% in June 2022. In January 2021, when Biden was sworn in, it was 1.4%.\n\nHe touted his efforts to combat fees \u2014 including on bank accounts and credit cards \u2014 that the White House has said will lower Americans\u2019 bills.\n\n\u201cThe idea that you bounce a check and you get a $30 fee for bouncing the check? I changed that \u2013 can\u2019t charge more than eight bucks for that. Or your credit card. Your late payment. $35. I mean, there\u2019s corporate greed going on out there and its got to be dealt with,\u201d he said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.",

Read our privacy policy\n\nElon Musk has claimed that the 2024 presidential election would likely be the last to be decided by US citizens, blaming an \u201cinflux\u201d of illegal immigrants being allowed to vote.\n\nThe comments made by the South African-born billionaire on his social media platform, X, came in response to news that Republicans in the House of Representatives passed a bill requiring citizenship status to be added to the ten-yearly census, despite opposition from the White House.\n\n\u201cUnanimous Democrat opposition to requiring citizenship for apportionment of House seats and Presidential electoral college votes says it all,\u201d Mr Musk said on Thursday in a reply to news that Dems voted along party lines on Wednesday and opposed the bill.\n\n\u201cThe Democratic Party goal is to disenfranchise US citizens by importing as many illegal immigrants as possible.\n\n\u201cGiven the massive influx of illegals from every country on Earth, 2024 will probably be the last election actually decided by US citizens,\u201d he claimed.\n\nopen image in gallery Elon Musk, co-founder of Tesla and SpaceX and owner of X Holdings Corp., speaks at the Milken Institute\u2019s Global Conference at the Beverly Hilton Hotel,on May 6, 2024 in Beverly Hills, California ( Getty Images )\n\nMr Musk often uses his platform to post an array of political views.\n\nDespite voting for Joe Biden in 2020, he has openly criticised the President\u2019s immigration policy, especially regarding the US-Mexico border, but he has also called to make the legal immigration process easier and quicker, which the President has stated he wants to do.\n\nThis latest post appeared to lean more towards the GOP\u2019s viewpoint that immigration, particularly in the southwest, is running unchecked, leading them to pursue the legislation voted on on Wednesday.\n\nThe bill, known as the Equal Representation Act, was presented under the guise of making the way congressional seat allocations are made, fairer.\n\nCurrently, numbers are decided by looking at the total population within a state, using data including the decennial census, and that would include those who are non-citizens.\n\nBy adding in a rule to include citizenship status on the form, GOP lawmakers want to use that data to exclude non-citizens from the population numbers used to determine congressional seats.\n\nopen image in gallery Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-LA) speaks during a news conference on the steps of the House of Representatives at the U.S. Capitol on May 8, 2024 in Washington, DC ( Getty Images )\n\n\u201cWe should not reward states and cities that violate federal immigration laws and maintain sanctuary policies with increased Congressional representation,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson said after Wednesday\u2019s vote.\n\n\u201cCommon sense dictates that only American citizens should be counted for electoral apportionment, and the Equal Representation Act ensures that.\u201d\n\nThe states and cities which could be affected include Democrat-leaning New York and California, but also more Republican-supporting states like Texas and Florida, which have the highest foreign-born populations.\n\nDespite the bill being aimed at Congressional seat allocations, Mr Musk tied this to non-citizens\u2019 voting abilities.\n\nBetween 2018 and 2022, at least 80 per cent of Republican voters were White, while 30-40 per cent of Democrat voters were non-white.\n\nIn 2024, it\u2019s expected that the percentage of the population\u2019s Hispanic eligible voters will reach a record high, with California home to a quarter of them, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nFigures from the American Immigration Council show there are around 45.2 million people who count as part of the US immigrant population, which is around 13 per cent of the country\u2019s total.\n\nOut of those, around 53 per cent are entitled to vote as they are naturalised American citizens, rather than so-called resident aliens, those in the country on work permits or illegal immigrants.\n\nThe GOP-backed bill would target those who are non-citizens, seeking to keep them away from the ballot box.\n\nopen image in gallery A resident arrives to vote in the state's primary election at a polling location on April 02, 2024 in Green Bay, Wisconsin ( Getty Images )\n\nEarlier this week, the Biden Administration spoke out against the bill, saying it \u201cstrongly opposed\u201d the change, arguing that it would break the Fourteenth Amendment of the US Constitution, which states the census should simply count the \u201cwhole number of persons\u201d in each state.\n\n\u201cThe Biden-Harris Administration is committed to ensuring that the census remains as accurate as possible and free from political interference, and to upholding the longstanding principle of equal representation enshrined in our Constitution, census statutes, and historical tradition,\u201d the White House statement read.\n\nClaims, including those from Mr Musk, that introducing this bill would make elections more secure have been widely debunked, with one of the main reasons being that many states and municipalities do not allow non-citizens to vote in elections, anyway.\n\nIn November\u2019s election, voters in Kentucky, Idaho, Iowa and Wisconsin will vote to change their constitutions to only allow US citizens to vote, following on from Alabama, Colorado, Florida, Louisiana, North Dakota and Ohio in recent years.\n\nIn New York City lawmakers are trying to open up elections to some non-citizens, but the plan is not to allow anyone living in NYC to vote, regardless of immigration status.\n\nInstead, those who are permanent residents - green card holders - and some with work authorisations would be allowed to vote in local elections alongside US citizens, rather than the \u201cinflux\u201d of new arrivals seen in recent years Mr Musk appeared to point to.",

What can a brain parasite really do to a human being?\nIn short: Robert F Kennedy Jr told a deposition he had a parasitic worm inside his brain, according to a New York Times report.\n\nRobert F Kennedy Jr told a deposition he had a parasitic worm inside his brain, according to a New York Times report. The presidential candidate also revealed he had been diagnosed with mercury poisoning at the same time.\n\nWhat's next? The US election is set for November. Mr Kennedy's campaign says he has no lingering health issues from either diagnosis.\n\nPresidential candidate Robert F Kennedy has told a deposition a parasitic worm \"ate a portion\" of his brain and then died, leading to a number of health issues.\n\nA New York Times investigation this week revealed part of a 2012 deposition in which the independent US presidential candidate said he had suffered memory loss and mental fogginess.\n\nHis symptoms were so severe friends became concerned he may have a brain tumour.\n\nInstead, a doctor believed he had a dead parasite in his brain, Mr Kennedy said.\n\n'I have cognitive problems, clearly'\n\nScans of Mr Kennedy's brain revealed a dark spot \u2013 several doctors concluded he had a tumour, and he was scheduled for a procedure at Duke University Medical Center.\n\nIt was while packing for the trip that he received a call from a different doctor.\n\nThis doctor believed the dark spot \"was caused by a worm that got into [his] brain and ate a portion of it and then died\", Mr Kennedy said in a deposition given during divorce proceedings from his second wife.\n\nMr Kennedy was at the time arguing his earning ability had been diminished by cognitive issues.\n\nThe 70-year-old is the third of 11 children born to former-US attorney-general Robert F Kennedy and a nephew of former president John F Kennedy.\n\nAfter the call, Mr Kennedy said he underwent a series of tests over the following weeks, which showed the dark spot on the scan had not changed.\n\nHe added he did not know the type of parasite but suspected he may have contracted it during a trip through South Asia.\n\nAround the same time as he was diagnosed with the worm, he was also facing another health scare \u2013 mercury poisoning.\n\nHe said blood testing done after experiencing \"severe brain fog\" and memory issues found his mercury levels were 10 times higher than what the Environmental Protection Agency considered safe.\n\n\"I have cognitive problems, clearly,\" he said in the deposition quoted by the New York Times.\n\n\"I have short-term memory loss, and I have longer-term memory loss that affects me.\"\n\nMr Kennedy's comments about his health were given as part of a 2012 deposition. (Reuters: Mark Makela)\n\nMr Kennedy said he believed his diet had poisoned him.\n\n\"I loved tuna fish sandwiches \u2026 I ate them all the time,\" he told the outlet.\n\nMr Kennedy said he also suffers from atrial fibrillation, a heartbeat abnormality that puts him at higher risk of stroke or heart failure.\n\nHe said he had not had an episode in more than a decade, but had been hospitalised multiple times for the condition.\n\nPresidential hopeful may have been infected with pork tapeworm\n\nMedical experts have since suggested the most likely parasite to have infected Mr Kennedy was a pork tapeworm.\n\nMr Kennedy has not confirmed this.\n\nUniversity of Queensland professor of parasitology Malcolm Jones said becoming infected with the parasite could lead to a condition called \"neurocysticercosis\".\n\nIt's not brain worms you need to worry about Photo shows A scan of a brain and worm. Headlines about brain worms can be alarming but this is an extremely rare event. There are, however, plenty of more common parasites which can infect your body and brain.\n\n\"Under most normal circumstances the pork tapeworm lives as an adult tapeworm within the small intestine of humans,\" he told the ABC.\n\n\"It reaches a length of around 4-7 metres and it's basically an egg producing factory, it produces thousands and thousands of eggs per day.\"\n\nThe eggs produced by the worm \u2013 around 30 microns or 0.03mm in diameter \u2013 leave the human body and infect pigs.\n\n\"[A cyst of eggs] sits in the pork meat, and \u2026 when people eat pork that's not cooked sufficiently, the parasites in the cyst inside the muscle can survive and become an adult tapeworm,\" said Professor Jones.\n\n\"However, there's an added problem. If a human should eat the eggs, the eggs will also become a cyst inside the body, sometimes inside the muscles.\n\n\"But in humans it seems to like to migrate to the brain \u2026 it happens really commonly, and there the larva develops from a tiny thing up into a cyst that's around 30mm in diameter.\n\n\"As it grows it feeds on host tissue and on nutrients carried in the blood, and it expands, and then probably by forcing out the normal tissue in the brain, it leads to a number of problems.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nNeurocysticercosis has been labelled the leading cause of adult-onset epilepsy worldwide, according to the US Center for Disease Control (CDC).\n\n\"Most people who have had it will have headaches, but it's quite common for people to have eyesight problems, they may have seizures as well,\" Professor Jones said.\n\n\"The real problem is diagnosing this disease effectively. Medical people will use blood tests and they don't always work.\n\n\"One of the best ways of diagnosing it is through the more complex imaging scans, CT scans, they can be very good.\"\n\nOnce diagnosed, the CDC recommended several different anti-parasitic drugs as potential treatments.\n\nHealth concerns 'a hilarious suggestion', campaign says\n\nMr Kennedy emerged as a wildcard candidate for the 2024 election, announcing his intention to run as an independent in October after abandoning a bid for Democratic nomination.\n\nSince entering the race he has made a name for himself advocating anti-vaccination beliefs and promoting public health conspiracy theories.\n\nHe has denied accusations of promoting misinformation.\n\nDuring his campaign he has also shared video of himself skiing with professional athletes and working out shirtless.\n\nAmid questions about his health, his campaign issued a statement after the NYT investigation was released, saying health concerns were \"a hilarious suggestion, given his competition\".\n\n\"The issue was resolved more than 10 years ago, and he is in robust physical and mental health.\"\n\nThey declined a NYT request to provide Mr Kennedy's medical records.\n\nA six page report released by the White House in February found President Joe Biden a \"healthy, active, robust 81-year-old \u2026 who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the presidency\".\n\nFormer president Donald Trump has also released a statement from his doctor, which found the 77-year-old's physical exams \"were well within the normal range\" and \"cognitive exams were exceptional\".\n\nHowever, debate over the age and competency of candidates has continued throughout the campaign.\n\nA majority of Americans believe both Mr Biden and Mr Trump are too old for another term as president, according to a joint poll by ABC News US and market researcher Ipsos.\n\nBruce Wolpe, a non-resident Senior Fellow at the University of Sydney's United States Studies Centre, said he didn't believe details about Mr Kennedy's health would impact the election outcome.\n\n\"I don't see any major political impact from this report on his medical condition, it's the Kennedy name that's driving his political campaign and that is unchanged,\" he said.\n\n\"A lot of people will filter this news out as strange but not important. Even if it is important, they've still seen RFK Jr in action and they're attracted to him, there's no way for that to affect his outcome.\n\n\"Another way of looking at it is [that] he chose a woman with no political experience to be his vice-president, that's ridiculous, but that hasn't changed his political trajectory.\n\n\"The key question remains not whether he has a worm on the brain but whether he has enough brains to get on enough ballots in enough states to potentially affect the outcome.\"\n\nThe 2024 US presidential election will be held on November 5.",

        "text": "Naturalization Statistics\nThe United States has a long history of welcoming immigrants from all parts of the world. During the last decade, USCIS welcomed more than 7.7 million naturalized citizens into the fabric of our nation.\n\nDeciding to become a U.S. citizen is an important milestone in an immigrant\u2019s life. Candidates for citizenship must show they are committed to the unifying principles that bind us as Americans. For that commitment, in return, they will enjoy the rights and privileges fundamental to U.S. citizenship.\n\nFiscal Year 2023 Naturalization Statistics1\n\nUSCIS welcomed 878,500 new citizens in fiscal year 2023 during naturalization ceremonies held across the United States and around the world. Naturalizations in fiscal years 2022 and 2023 made up nearly a quarter (24%) of all naturalizations over the past decade.\n\nMonthly Naturalizations in FY 2023\n\nUSCIS was able to return to normal year production levels for naturalization applications in FY 2021 despite limitations due to the COVID-19 pandemic; and in FY 2023, USCIS production levels for naturalization applications continue to surpass pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThe Dallas (4.1% of all naturalizations), Houston (4.1%), Chicago (3.7%), Newark (3.4%), and San Francisco (2.9%) field offices naturalized the largest number of new citizens in FY 2023.\n\nCountries of Birth\n\nAmong the top five countries of birth for people naturalizing in FY 2023, Mexico was the lead country, with 12.7% of all naturalizations, followed by India (6.7%), the Philippines (5.1%), the Dominican Republic (4.0%), and Cuba (3.8%). The top five countries of birth comprised 32% of the naturalized citizens in FY 2023.\n\nState, City/Borough, and Core-Based Statistical Area of Residence\n\nApplicants who submit a Form N-400, Application for Naturalization, list their current address on the form. Using this information, USCIS can determine the state of residence at the time a person applied for naturalization. Of all citizens naturalized in FY 2023, 70% resided in 10 states (in descending order): California, Texas, Florida, New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Washington, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and Virginia. More than 50% resided in the top four states.\n\n\n\nThe top five cities (including boroughs) where people who naturalized resided were (in descending order): Brooklyn, Miami, Houston, the Bronx, and Los Angeles.\n\n\n\nThe top five Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) where people who naturalized resided were (in descending order): New York-Newark-Jersey City (13.5%), Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim (6.4%), Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Pompano Beach (5.8%), Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land (3.9%), and Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington (3.7%).\n\nAge and Gender2\n\nMore than 39% of citizens naturalized in FY 2023 were 30 to 44 years old. The median age of those naturalizing in FY 2023 was 41 years. About 18% were younger than 30 years old, and 37 new citizens were centenarians (age 100 and older)!\n\n\n\nWomen made up nearly 55% of those naturalized in FY 2023, and they were the majority in every age group. Twenty three of the 37 centenarians were women as well.\n\n\n\nNaturalization Eligibility\n\nTo be eligible for naturalization, an applicant must fulfill certain eligibility requirements set forth in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). The requirements generally include being a lawful permanent resident (LPR) for at least five years. There are also other special naturalization provisions that exempt certain applicants, including certain spouses of U.S. citizens and applicants with military service, from one or more of the general requirements for naturalization. Most people who naturalized in FY 2023 were eligible for naturalization based on being LPRs for at least 5 years (INA Section 316(a)), followed by applicants who were eligible based on being LPRs for at least 3 years and married to a U.S. citizen for 3 years (INA Section 319(a)) and applicants who were eligible based on their military service during a designated period of hostilities (INA Section 329).\n\nSection of Law Section of Law Description Percent of Total INA Section 316(a) LPR for 5 years 82.9% INA Section 319(a) LPR for 3 years (married to U.S. citizen 3 years) 15.6% INA Section 329 Military service during designated period of hostilities 1.4% All other All others 0.1%\n\nIn general, a noncitizen must spend at least 5 years as a lawful permanent resident to be eligible for naturalization while a spouse of a U.S. citizen must spend at least 3 years as a lawful permanent resident. The median years spent as an LPR for all citizens naturalized in FY 2023 was 7 years.\n\nThe median years spent as an LPR varied by the citizens\u2019 country of birth. The countries with the largest number of new citizens in FY 2023 and their median years spent as an LPR are shown below. Out of these top countries, applicants from Mexico and Canada spent the longest time, with 10.4 years, and applicants from Nigeria spent the shortest, with 5.6 years.\n\nClass of Admission\n\nMost people who naturalized came to the United States as immediate relatives of U.S. citizens or through family-sponsored preference categories, followed by refugees and asylees, employment-based preference categories, and the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program.\n\nNaturalization Test Initial Pass Rate\n\nSection 312 of the INA requires that naturalization applicants demonstrate an ability to read, write, and speak words in ordinary usage in the English language and have a knowledge and understanding of U.S. history and government (civics). To meet these requirements and become naturalized citizens, applicants must pass an English test (which includes understanding, speaking, reading, and writing) and a civics test.\n\n\n\nThe naturalization test consists of two components: an English and a civics component. Applicants who fail one or both test components will have a second opportunity to pass the portions of the test that they failed, called a re-exam. The pass rate below represents the cumulative pass rate of applicants who took both the English test and the current version of the civics test since Oct. 1, 2022. It also counts those who were exempt from one of more portions of the naturalization test or had an approved Form N-648, Medical Certification for Disability Exceptions, as passing.\n\n\n\nThe first percentage (89.5%) denotes the pass rate of applicants who took the initial exam only and includes applicants who were exempt from one of more portions of the naturalization test or had an approved Form N-648. The second percentage (95.3%) denotes the pass rate of applicants who took the initial and re-exam and includes applicants who were exempt from one of more portions of the naturalization test or had an approved Form N-648.\n\nAttorney or Accredited Representative\n\nAn attorney or accredited representative appearing before DHS must file Form G-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Accredited Representative, in each case to establish their eligibility to represent a client in an immigration matter. In FY 2023, 19.3% of those naturalized had a Form G-28 filed by an attorney or accredited representative to represent them in their naturalization proceedings. Over 61% of all applicants who had a Form G-28 filed by an attorney or accredited representative were over the age of 40.\n\nFee Waiver5\n\nWe are funded largely by application and petition fees. Recognizing that some applicants cannot pay the filing fees, we established a fee waiver process for certain forms and benefit types, including the Form N-400, Application for Naturalization. To request a fee waiver, submit the most current version of Form I-912, Request for Fee Waiver. See the USCIS Policy Manual, Volume 1, Part B, Chapter 4, and Additional Information on Filing a Fee Waiver.\n\nIn FY 2023, 14.6% of those naturalized had an approved fee waiver. Females (9.1%) had more fee waivers than males (5.4%). Those 65 and older had the most fee waivers out of all age groups that naturalized in FY 2023 (3.7%).\n\nMore Naturalization Statistics\n\nNaturalization receipts, approvals, denials, and pending applications by field office are also published quarterly on the USCIS Immigration and Citizenship Data page.\n\nTables\n\nData Table 1: Approved naturalizations for FY 2023 and top 10 countries Country of birth FY 2023 Mexico 111,500 India 59,100 Philippines 44,800 Dominican Republic 35,200 Cuba 33,200 Vietnam 32,800 China 25,800 El Salvador 21,100 Jamaica 20,200 Colombia 17,100 All Others 477,800 Total 878,500\n\nSource: USCIS, ELIS.

Counts with unknowns can be found in Data Table 5.\n\n3 Read more information on the general eligibility requirements for naturalization on our website.\n\n4 The median years spent as an LPR is based on the time between the date USCIS approved an individual\u2019s adjustment of status application or when the individual entered the United States as an LPR and the date the individual took the Oath of Allegiance. In most cases, the effective date of LPR status is the date USCIS approves the applicant\u2019s adjustment of status application or the date the applicant is admitted into the United States with an immigrant visa. For certain classifications, however, the effective date of becoming an LPR may be a date that is earlier than the actual approval of the status (commonly referred to as a \u201crollback\u201d date). For example, a refugee is generally considered an LPR as of the date of entry into the United States, and an asylee is generally considered an LPR 1 year before the date USCIS approves the adjustment application. Thus, for asylees and refugees who adjust to LPR status, the time spent as an LPR may be shorter than the 5 year period generally required for naturalization because they are eligible to apply for naturalization 5 years from the rollback date.\n\n5 Read more information on filing a fee waiver on our website. A reduced fee is not the same as a fee waiver and is not included in this analysis. Read more information on requesting a reduced filing fee on our website.\n\n6 Current or former military members do not have to pay any fees for applying for naturalization under INA 328 or 329. The Department of Defense pays the application fees on their behalf. They are not included as part of the fee waiver group in this analysis.",

Despite the prison sentence, he said he found pride in something he knew he could do well.\n\n\u201cMy dorm came in first place for six months straight, so I\u2019m like if I\u2019m doing this for free, when I get out I might as well do it because I didn\u2019t think any establishment would be worse than cleaning a prison,\u201d said McKenzie. \u201cSo it\u2019s something I learned a passion for at an early age.\u201d\n\nWhen he was released from prison, he had trouble moving up in jobs because of his felony conviction, so he eventually started his own cleaning business.\n\n\u201cI was like, you know what, let\u2019s just go for it,\u201d said McKenzie.\n\nBut even a successful business owner, it took 10 years for McKenzie to regain his right to vote, only after Florida voters approved a ballot amendment pushed by the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition.\n\nHe now works for the organization to help other returning citizens returning from incarceration fully regain their voting rights. He said the state voter registration system, though, can create confusion.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen people who felt they were whole-heartedly eligible to vote receive a voter registration card, and then they go vote and turn around and get arrested,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that can lead to apathy.\n\n\u201cThey just totally check out of the process, right?\" he said. \"Even those who are eligible or right there at the finish line, one little hiccup, can cause them to not want to be involved in democracy, which is crazy.\"\n\nMcKenzie said when he first got out of prison, he didn\u2019t care about voting.\n\n\u201cI think for a lot of people, they don\u2019t understand it so they stay away from it,\" he said. \"And I didn\u2019t think voting was necessary, and I didn\u2019t think it was a tool I needed to survive, so it was the last use of my worries, to be honest,.\"\n\nNow that he can vote again, McKenzie said he doesn\u2019t miss an election. But he gets why other Black men don\u2019t vote.\n\nWith that segment of society disproportionately incarcerated, McKenzie says even if they regain their voting rights, many don\u2019t care to vote. He said those running for office must make the connection.\n\nAs a small business owner, the economy is everything, and as a father of three, McKenzie is also concerned about education. And if government leaders or candidates aren\u2019t addressing affordable housing, he believes many in his community lose faith in the system.\n\n\u201cSomeone who doesn\u2019t have somewhere to live, I would imagine voting\u2019s not a priority to them,\u201d said McKenzie. \u201cSomeone who can\u2019t live with their family members because they\u2019re banned because of a conviction, voting\u2019s not going to be something. So having a candidate or an issue that\u2019s on the ballot that can address some of that, or at least try to address some of that, that\u2019s one of the very first thoughts to at least get people to participate.\"\n\n\"If not, they don\u2019t see a reason to be connected to voting,\" he continued.",

Read more CNN Opinion here.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nWhen President Joe Biden made clear that he was going to run for reelection, I had a sense of what his election strategy was and thought it was an intelligent path to victory. After the chaos of Covid-19 and the administration of former President Donald Trump, Biden would stand for normalcy and a rising tide of good economic news. Trump would divide Republicans, with significant chunks of the party wishing that someone like former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley or Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis would be their nominee. Meanwhile, Trump would unite and motivate Democrats, allowing Biden to focus on independent voters in the swing states that threw the Electoral College to Trump in 2016 and to Biden in 2020.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion\u2019s newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nI have to admit, none of this is playing out as I had thought. Trump is now leading in almost all the swing states, and behind those numbers lie even more troubling details. As someone worried about the prospects of a second Trump term, I think it is best to be honest about reality. I understand that polls are not always accurate, but in general they have tended to underestimate Trump\u2019s support, not overestimate it. I doubt that there are many shy Biden voters in the country.\n\nThe economy has been in a robust recovery for more than two years now \u2014 with unemployment hitting a 54-year low in 2023 and increasing only slightly since then \u2014 but Biden is getting little credit for it. The shift here is stark. On the question of whom voters trust more to deal with the economy, Trump has a 22-point lead over Biden, according to an NBC poll from January. This marks a 15-point bump for Trump compared to the same poll in 2020. Perhaps this is because inflation is a far more pervasive problem than unemployment, affecting all Americans every day. Perhaps it is that people\u2019s views on the economy are largely derived from their broader attitudes towards the candidates. But whatever the reasons, this is a stunning reversal in the midst of a relentless stream of good economic news.\n\nOn cultural issues, Biden and the Democrats benefit from opposition to the Republican Party\u2019s position on abortion. But on the other great cultural issue of immigration, Biden is 35 points behind Trump as to who would handle it better. And I do wonder whether abortion will be as large an issue in a presidential race, given that reversing Roe v. Wade threw the issue to state governments and not the federal government.\n\nPerhaps the most worrying new trend for Democrats is that far from being the more unified party, they are now bitterly divided over the war in Gaza. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has said the eruption of pro-Palestinian protests could be \u201cBiden\u2019s Vietnam\u201d and even invoked the specter of President Lyndon Johnson choosing not to run for reelection in 1968 because of the public opposition to that war. The analogy is farfetched \u2014 America was itself sending hundreds of thousands of troops to Vietnam, with more being recruited from college campuses every week. But there is no denying that the party seems more openly divided than it has been in decades. Only 33% of Americans say they approved of Biden\u2019s handling of the Israel-Hamas war, which is criticized both by people who think he is too soft and people who think he is too hard on Israel.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans seem to be uniting behind Trump. Whatever opposition he faced in the primaries has largely melted away. And the trials against him keep him in the spotlight, infuriating members of his base who see him as a martyr. They may even serve to make him the object of some sympathy among other people who believe that many of these trials are politically motivated. (That happens to be true in my opinion. I doubt the first two indictments would have been brought against a defendant whose name was not Donald Trump.) A majority of Americans are skeptical that Trump will be able to get a fair trial, according to a CNN poll. (Trump denies wrongdoing in all the cases.)\n\nAnd I haven\u2019t even mentioned third-party candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (or Cornel West or Jill Stein), all of whom could take votes away from Biden.\n\nThings could change. Polls do suggest that were Trump to be convicted of a felony, it could shift voters in Biden\u2019s favor. The administration may be able to pull off a ceasefire in Gaza and then a broader political settlement that gives Palestinians political rights and Israel diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia. Trump could always embroil himself in some new kind of scandal. But trendlines are not working in Biden\u2019s favor. He needs to do something bold and dramatic to seize the initiative \u2014 on asylum policy for example \u2014 and reverse these numbers.\n\nThe one that troubles me most concerns the question of who is more competent. Biden led Trump by nine points in 2020, but Trump now leads by 16 points in 2024. That 25-point shift could be a reflection of people\u2019s sense that the president\u2019s age is affecting his capacity to govern. If so, there is very little that Biden can do to change that perception.",

Several third-party hopefuls are also running. President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump will face each other in the U.S. presidential election on November 5 this year.(AFP)\n\nHere is a list of the candidates:\n\nREPUBLICAN PARTY\n\nDONALD TRUMP: Trump, in office from 2017-2021, has secured enough delegates to clinch the Republican nomination, setting up the first presidential rematch in nearly 70 years.\n\nHe has leveraged his unprecedented legal challenges to solidify support among his base and has cast his third bid for the White House in part as retribution against perceived political enemies. He calls supporters jailed for the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol \"hostages\" and campaigns using increasingly dystopian rhetoric, refusing to rule out possible violence around the Nov. 5 contest.\n\nTrump, 77, faces 88 charges in four criminal cases over efforts to subvert the 2020 election, retaining classified documents after leaving office and alleged efforts to cover up a hush money payment to a porn star.\n\nHe denies wrongdoing in all the cases, including the criminal trial over the hush money payment that began in New York on April 15, which could be the only one of the four to go before a jury ahead of the Nov. 5 election.\n\nHe has called the criminal charges a Democratic conspiracy designed to keep him from winning, with some of his legal challenges reaching the U.S. Supreme Court. The U.S. Justice Department denies any political interference. If elected to another four-year term, Trump has vowed revenge on his political enemies and said he would not be a dictator except \"on day one,\" later calling that \"a joke.\" He also wants the power to replace federal civil service workers with loyalists. He has suggested he may not accept the election results were he to lose in November. Trump sparked criticism from Western leaders for saying the U.S. would not defend NATO members that failed to spend enough on defense and would encourage Russia to attack them. He also pressed congressional Republicans to stall military aid for Ukraine before later reversing course. Trump has made immigration his top domestic campaign issue, declaring he would carry out mass deportations, create holding camps, utilize the National Guard and possibly federal troops, end birthright citizenship, and expand a travel ban on people from certain countries. He has referred to migrants as \"animals\" and has not ruled out building detention camps on U.S. soil. On abortion, Trump takes credit for the U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, and in April said abortion should remain a state issue. While he has criticized some Republican-led state actions such as Florida's six-week abortion ban, he said he would allow Republican-led states to track women's pregnancies and prosecute those who violate their state bans.\n\nHe has promised sweeping changes that included eliminating Obamacare health insurance before saying in an April 11 video that he would not \"terminate\" it. He has also vowed to undo much of the Biden administration\u2019s work to fight climate change. Trump has yet to announce a vice presidential running mate, but several possibilities have been floated. Mike Pence, who ran alongside Trump in 2016 and 2020 but was targeted by Trump and his supporters amid the Jan. 6 attack, refused to endorse him in November's contest.\n\nDEMOCRATIC PARTY\n\nJOE BIDEN: Biden launched his 2020 candidacy as an urgent bid to defend American liberties and protect democracy and has cast his reelection bid in the same light, saying Trump threatens the future of American democracy.\n\nBiden faced no serious challenger for the party's nomination, which he clinched in March. November's election will be much tougher, with the most recent Reuters/Ipsos poll putting Biden's voter support slightly ahead at 40% of registered voters, 1 percentage point ahead of Trump's 39%. Biden, already the oldest U.S. president ever at 81, must convince voters he is more fit for office than Trump, who is just four years younger, while combating low approval ratings.\n\nThe economy will also factor in Biden's reelection campaign. While the U.S. escaped an anticipated recession and is growing faster than economists expected, inflation and the cost of essentials are weighing on voters. Biden pushed through massive economic stimulus and infrastructure spending packages to boost U.S. industrial output, but has received little recognition from voters so far as his campaign moves to highlight new semiconductor manufacturing plants, housing plans and other economic efforts. Biden's handling of immigration policy has been criticized by Republicans and Democrats as migrant crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border hit record highs.\n\nHe has led the response of Western governments to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, persuading allies to punish Russia and support Kyiv. Biden has provided military aid to Israel in its conflict with Hamas in Gaza while pushing for more humanitarian assistance, but he has faced sharp criticism from some Democrats for not pushing harder for a ceasefire or matching his tougher rhetoric on Israel with action. He has said he will withhold weapons from Israel if it invades Rafah.\n\nIntensifying U.S. student protests over the war in Gaza also could weigh on his reelection bid, with some organizers behind the \"uncommitted\" movement siphoning some support from Biden in the primaries now seeking to join up with campus protesters. Biden secured additional funding for both Ukraine and Israel in April after a months-long battle with congressional Republicans.\n\nMARIANNE WILLIAMSON: Best-selling author and self-help guru Marianne Williamson, 71, relaunched her long-shot 2024 presidential bid focusing on \"justice and love\" less than one month after dropping out.\n\nIn a February statement, she said she was getting back in to fight Trump's \"dark and authoritarian vision\" after earlier suspending it because she was losing \"the horse race.\"\n\nWilliamson previously ran as a Democrat in the 2020 presidential primary but dropped out of that race before any votes were cast.\n\nINDEPENDENTS\n\nROBERT F. KENNEDY JR\n\nAn anti-vaccine activist and environmental advocate, Kennedy, 70, is running as an independent after initially challenging Biden for the Democratic nomination. While he lags in overall polling, Kennedy could siphon votes from Trump and Biden, with the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll showing he was backed by 8% of registered voters, a seven-percentage-point drop from March. The son of U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1968 during his own presidential bid, Kennedy has drawn rebukes from his famous family, which has publicly backed Biden. Kennedy, who chose wealthy lawyer Nicole Shanahan as his running mate, supports Israel and has questioned a six-week ceasefire backed by Biden.\n\nHe said he views the U.S. southern border situation as a humanitarian crisis and opposes Trump's border wall. He has also vowed to repeal parts of Biden's climate bill over tax breaks he says help the oil industry. Kennedy has taken different positions on abortion rights, including restrictions on when a woman can access an abortion. He told Reuters he thought every abortion was a \"tragedy\" but that it should be a woman's right \"throughout the pregnancy.\" He has been criticized for making false medical claims over the years on vaccines but says he would still allow Americans to have access to them. He himself had a brain worm more than a decade ago but has fully recovered, his campaign said in May.\n\nKennedy is officially on the ballot in a handful of states so far, including California, Michigan and Utah, and faces a challenging and costly battle to be listed in all 50.\n\nCORNEL WEST\n\nThe political activist, philosopher and academic is making a third-party bid for president that is most likely to appeal to progressive, Democratic-leaning voters.\n\nWest, 70, initially ran as a Green Party candidate but, in October, he said people \"want good policies over partisan politics\" and announced his bid as an independent. He has promised to end poverty and guarantee housing.\n\nJILL STEIN\n\nJill Stein, a physician who ran under the Green Party in 2016, is trying once again in 2024.\n\nShe launched her current campaign accusing Democrats of betraying their promises \"for working people, youth and the climate again and again - while Republicans don\u2019t even make such promises in the first place.\"\n\nStein, 73, raised millions of dollars for recounts after Trump's surprise 2016 victory. Her allegations yielded only one electoral review in Wisconsin, which showed Trump had won.",

        "text": "Trump\u2019s Use of Campaign Funds to Pay Legal Bills\nSince leaving office, former president Trump has been involved in an array of criminal and civil litigation \u2014 some that relates to his campaigns and presidency and some that does not. To cover the enormous legal bills, estimated at more than $100 million, he has turned to his political action committees (PACs), essentially having campaign donors pay costs for which he would otherwise be on the hook personally.\n\nA lot of this spending falls into legal gray areas, but thanks to loopholes in the law and lackluster enforcement, it is likely to continue until Congress takes steps to shore up existing rules and enact broader campaign finance safeguards.\n\nWhich cases is Trump spending campaign money on?\n\nTrump has spent campaign money to cover legal costs in seemingly all of the some two dozen proceedings he\u2019s faced since leaving office. Some of these matters directly relate to his campaigns and actions as president, including the lawsuits, investigations, and state and federal prosecutions focused on efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his retention of classified documents after leaving office. However, other legal spending has gone toward purely personal matters that have nothing to do with Trump\u2019s candidacy or time in office, such as the civil and criminal fraud probes into his business in New York.\n\nNotably, there is a lot of crossover between the lawyers Trump has paid to handle his political matters and those working on personal cases. For instance, Trump has paid nearly $6 million of donor money to the law firm Chris Kise and Associates, which has been involved in both the New York civil fraud investigation and the classified documents case.\n\nHow has Trump paid his legal bills?\n\nThe former president has relied almost entirely on donations to his campaign and affiliated PACs to pay his lawyers, to the tune of more than $100 million as of early 2024.\n\nFollowing his 2020 election loss, Trump received more than $250 million in donations from supporters to fuel an \u201celection defense fund.\u201d He divided that money between two campaign entities: his 2020 presidential campaign committee, which he subsequently converted into a freestanding PAC called Make America Great Again (MAGA) PAC, and a second entity called Save America PAC, which is a so-called \u201cleadership PAC\u201d (a type of PAC that a federal candidate can establish for the ostensible purpose of supporting other candidates).\n\nBeginning in early 2021, Trump began spending funds from these two PACs on his myriad legal proceedings \u2014 including personal matters. The fact that MAGA PAC was no longer a campaign committee enabled him to take advantage of a loophole in campaign finance law prohibiting candidates from using campaign committee funds for personal expenses, but not PAC funds. Through early 2024, MAGA PAC spent $30 million on Trump\u2019s legal expenses. Roughly another $70 million has come from Save America, which is subject to a similar loophole.\n\nBy early 2024, however, Save America was running out of money, even as Trump\u2019s legal bills continued to mount. To boost his leadership PAC\u2019s cash base, Trump began to steer online donations to it and also set up a joint fundraising agreement with the Republican National Committee, under which the RNC prioritizes funneling money to Save America over filling its own coffers. (The party has also directly paid some of Trump\u2019s legal bills, as it did when he was president and as the Democratic National Committee has done for President Biden.) Additionally, Save America has clawed back a $60 million donation it made to MAGA Inc., a pro-Trump super PAC, through an unusual series of monthly payments. Despite these efforts, Save America is running low on funds: the PAC had just $4 million on hand at the end of March, as Trump headed into his first criminal trial.\n\nPerhaps for this reason, MAGA Inc. \u2014 which as a super PAC can raise and spend unlimited money on elections but is supposed to operate independently from Trump\u2019s campaign \u2014 may also be funneling additional money to firms involved in Trump\u2019s legal operations. But since the super PAC\u2019s FEC disclosures don\u2019t specify what these firms were paid to do, it\u2019s not clear what expenses it is covering.\n\nIs Trump allowed to spend campaign funds on legal bills?\n\nTrump\u2019s use of PAC money to cover so many legal expenses tests the boundaries of current law, but practically speaking, legal loopholes and lax enforcement of campaign rules by the Federal Election Commission mean it is likely to continue.\n\nThere are several established, permissible ways for candidates to spend donor money on legal expenses. Candidates can spend money from their campaign committees on legal fees that directly relate to their campaign or responsibilities in office (candidates and parties can also raise money separately for election-related proceedings, such as recounts). Even these rules have gray areas: for instance, Trump\u2019s alleged conduct in the aftermath of the 2020 election was in many cases well outside the scope of any official duties or legitimate campaign role. But he could still argue that it related to his 2020 campaign and that he is allowed to spend campaign committee funds on legal bills for the resulting investigations and lawsuits.\n\nWhat is clear, however, is that campaign funds may not be used for legal fees related to personal matters, even if those matters might have some tangential connection to Trump\u2019s candidacy or overall public reputation.\n\nFor these latter sorts of expenses, federal elected officials and candidates are allowed under rules created by congressional ethics committees and the Office of Governmental Ethics to establish personal legal defense funds, which can be used to cover expenses related to any legal matter touching the beneficiary\u2019s reputation and fitness for office. These are subject to strict contribution limits and disclosure requirements similar to campaign committees.\n\nTrump does not appear to have established a legal defense fund to pay his own bills (although supporters have reportedly established a fund for allies and staff). He is also not covering most legal costs from his primary 2024 campaign accounts. Instead, virtually all the money for his legal bills \u2014 including what appear to be personal legal bills \u2014 is coming from MAGA PAC, Save America, and now MAGA Inc.\n\nBecause of gaps in campaign finance law, this spending is not necessarily illegal. In particular, the evenly-divided FEC has repeatedly deadlocked on the question of whether leadership PACs like Save America are subject to the same restrictions on personal use of campaign funds as campaign committees, effectively leaving Trump free to tap into Save America\u2019s accounts for many expenses that would be forbidden if he used money from his campaign account. Thanks to a quirk in the law, personal use restrictions also do not cover traditional PACs unaffiliated with a candidate, which is what MAGA PAC became after the 2020 election, or super PACs such as MAGA Inc.\n\nThese loopholes are well known, and Trump is hardly the first to exploit them. Leadership PACs in particular have become frequent vessels for exorbitant personal spending by candidates.\n\nOne catch, however, is that Trump is not just a private citizen, but the presumptive GOP nominee for president. As a candidate for federal office, his campaign is subject to strict limits on the contributions it can receive from separate PACs such as Save America, MAGA PAC, and MAGA Inc. Not only are such entities limited in how much they can directly donate to Trump\u2019s campaign (or in the case of a super PAC like MAGA, Inc. strictly prohibited from donating), they are also in theory prohibited from coordinating their spending with him, since that is tantamount to making a contribution.\n\nOne might think that such restrictions would be a bar on outside PACs covering tens of millions of dollars in a candidate\u2019s legal fees. But not so fast. In the 14 years since Citizens United, during which super PAC coordination with candidates in particular has been rampant, the FEC has almost never even investigated coordination restrictions, let alone sought to enforce them, despite the commission\u2019s own nonpartisan staff recommending investigations dozens of times.\n\nThe complete failure to enforce coordination rules is also likely why MAGA Inc. and Save America have felt free to move tens of millions of dollars back and forth between each other. Given that it is illegal for MAGA Inc. to donate more than $5,000 directly to Save America (including in the form of loans), their strange monthly refund system also tests the boundaries of the law, but with few practical consequences.\n\nTrump\u2019s legal spending practices may also run afoul of other rules. Recently, the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center filed a complaint with the FEC alleging that Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign, along with Save America and other PACs, reimbursed an accounting firm for millions of dollars\u2019 worth of legal costs that the company appears to have illegally fronted to cover the former president\u2019s bills. If these allegations are true, they would violate the federal prohibition on corporations contributing directly to political campaigns, as well as campaign transparency rules requiring the true nature of such payouts to be disclosed. Whether and when the FEC will actually take action on this complaint remains to be seen.\n\nWhat can be done about this?\n\nTrump\u2019s ability to use PAC money to pay off even personal legal bills points to the need for significant reforms to campaign finance laws. At a minimum, Congress should extend restrictions on the personal use and misappropriation of campaign funds to all PACs, including super PACs and leadership PACs \u2014 something that the FEC, despite failing to address the issue itself, has repeatedly called on Congress to take up.\n\nA broader overhaul of federal campaign finance rules is also necessary. Much of the gray area in the law regarding the use of campaign funds for legal fees comes from uneven enforcement. The Freedom to Vote Act, major voting and democracy reform legislation that is currently before Congress, would overhaul the FEC\u2019s enforcement process to enhance the commission\u2019s ability to investigate violations and enforce the law. It would also tighten anti-coordination rules and improve campaign transparency, among other important changes. Passing that bill would go a long way towards addressing some of the biggest problems with our campaign finance system and reinforcing other democratic safeguards.",

But interviews with nearly two dozen young Latino students on college campuses in battleground states revealed many are currently unmotivated to back a candidate or even cast a ballot.\n\nThe students in Arizona, Pennsylvania and Georgia spoke passionately about Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, the rising cost of living, immigration and abortion. Almost everyone interviewed said TikTok is where they get most of their news.\n\nAmid the palm trees at Arizona State University, senior Darien Guerrero, 22, said he leans Republican. What he cares about most is the \u201cgreat threat of climate change.\u201d\n\nBut voting in November wasn\u2019t high on his to-do list.\n\nClimate change \u201cis a problem that is bigger than us, bigger than the elections, the parties or anything. This is a human civilization problem,\u201d said Guerrero, a biology major. He added that those in power often seem to be in the way of his generation\u2019s efforts to fix the issue.\n\nIn the western U.S., which includes the battlegrounds of Arizona and Nevada, Latinos are nearly 4 of every 10 newly eligible voters \u2014 defined as those who have reached ages 18 or 19 since the 2022 midterms. In the South, Latinos are 24% of newly eligible voters, and in the Northeast they make up 19%.\n\nDarien Guerrero. Suzanne Gamboa / NBC News\n\nYoung voters usually favor Democratic candidates: The Harvard Youth Poll showed young Hispanics favor President Joe Biden over former President Donald Trump 50% to 27% in a two-way race, with 22% saying they don\u2019t know. National polls currently show a tight race among all voters.\n\nIf young voters, many of them Latino, don\u2019t vote in large enough numbers for Democrats \u2014 particularly in Arizona, Georgia or Pennsylvania \u2014 \u201cthat could be the whole race,\u201d said Republican consultant Mike Madrid.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not [if] Democrats will win the youth vote \u2014 they will \u2014 but percentage is everything,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is what has been narrowing this year, in a way that has been unprecedented.\u201d\n\nPamela Gomez, 20, a biomedical student at ASU, said she intends to register to vote \u2014 but not yet. She passed on doing so with a group registering voters just a few yards away.\n\n\u201cI wish voting for a third party was more common or had more effect,\u201d Gomez said. \u201cRight now, I don\u2019t want to vote for either Biden or Trump, but I know going for a third party doesn\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d\n\nPamela Gomez. Suzanne Gamboa / NBC News\n\nBiden and Democrats drew on solid young Latino support in battleground states to secure their 2020 and 2022 victories. In 2020, new voters of all backgrounds under age 30 favored Biden over Trump, 59% to 33%. Trump won new voters of all backgrounds over age 30, 55% to 42%.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how that will play out in this election cycle. \u201cThere\u2019s a general sense of both parties are the same, nothing\u2019s going to change; institutions have failed us; we don\u2019t trust any of the institutions no matter who\u2019s in power,\u201d said political scientist Stella Rouse, director of ASU\u2019s Hispanic Research Center.\n\nIsiger Palomino-Garcia, a student at Lehigh Carbon Community College, lives in a section of eastern Pennsylvania considered the state\u2019s \u201cLatino Belt.\u201d The Lehigh Valley was once known as an industrial center and includes Allentown, the former steel town that now has the third-most Hispanic people of any city in Pennsylvania. Every block in downtown Allentown seems to have a Dominican barbershop, churches with Spanish names and countless Hispanic food restaurants.\n\nCandidates, especially Biden, are pinning their hopes on potential voters like Palomino-Garcia. But while she remembered being \u201creally happy\u201d that Barack Obama was president when she was a teenager, the 21-year-old said she hasn\u2019t decided whether to vote this year because none of the candidates excite her.\n\nIsiger Palomino Garcia. Serge Stambolyan\n\nThat\u2019s not for lack of effort on the part of the Democratic Party, according to Victor Martinez, owner and co-host of Allentown-based Spanish-language radio station La Mega 101.7 FM. He said this election is the first time he has seen the Democratic Party pay such early attention to Latino voters overall in the region.\n\nThe Biden campaign has purchased ad time on the station, given Martinez unprecedented access to Democratic candidates, and invited him to broadcast live from the White House during the State of the Union address. Republicans have not yet approached him, he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not worried about young people voting for Trump,\u201d said Democratic strategist Chuck Rocha, who was a senior adviser to Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign. \u201cI\u2019m worried about them staying home.\u201d\n\nIsrael-Hamas war and rising housing costs top concerns\n\nDalton State College is Georgia\u2019s first Hispanic-serving institution, a federal designation for nonprofit institutions with at least 25% Hispanic full-time undergraduate enrollment. Located in the deep-red Whitfield County, which is represented by far-right Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene in Congress, Dalton boasts a large manufacturing industry and was once dubbed the \u201ccarpet capital of the world.\u201d It\u2019s also home to a vibrant Latino community that has come to define the small city in recent decades.\n\nNearly 40% of students on campus are Hispanic, and many of them grew up in Dalton or the surrounding area. Whitfield County is home to just over 11,000 registered Latino voters \u2014 about the same number of votes that carried Biden to victory in the state in 2020.\n\nIt is apparent here, as in Pennsylvania and Arizona, that the Biden campaign hasn\u2019t yet eased young Latinos\u2019 worries on several issues, in particular the Israel-Hamas war and frustrations over the lack of affordable housing.\n\nEmmanuel Ramirez, 19, a computer science freshman at Dalton State College, said that while he\u2019s leaning toward Biden, he hasn\u2019t ruled out voting for a third party candidate in part because he\u2019s unimpressed by the candidates\u2019 responses to the Israel-Hamas war.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s infuriating. It\u2019s frustrating,\u201d Ramirez said. At the time of the interview, Ramirez was fasting for Ramadan to show solidarity with his Muslim friends.\n\nBiden, who signed a bill Tuesday that includes includes $26 billion in assistance to Israel and humanitarian relief in Gaza, has urged Israel to agree to a cease-fire and to curb attacks on Gaza, while Trump said in March that Israel should \u201cfinish the problem,\u201d though he has otherwise mostly avoided talking about the war. Many young Latinos who expressed anger over the civilian deaths in Gaza were opposed to sending money to Israel and supported a cease-fire.\n\nMany students were familiar with videos on social media that they said show Israeli strikes killing and injuring Palestinian civilians, including children, but some were not familiar with the details of the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks and hostage takings that triggered the current conflict.\n\nMarcel Lopez. Suzanne Gamboa / NBC News\n\nMarcel Lopez, 20, who is getting his associate degree in engineering at Phoenix Community College, was also unhappy with the billions the U.S. is sending to support Ukraine in what he sees as \u201can unwinnable war.\u201d\n\nRocha said the war, along with a sense of rebellion and the \u201cnone of the above\u201d view of Trump and Biden, are at the heart of malaise among young voters.\n\nAcross all three battleground states, young Latino college students said one of their top economic concerns was the increasing cost of housing.\n\nNicholas Hernandez, 22, an ASU political science and transborder studies major, said his family recently moved out of their four-bedroom west Phoenix home because the rent kept increasing. \u201cA lot of my friends talk about that, too. Their parents\u2019 rents have increased as well.\u201d\n\nHe works two jobs and pays his school-related costs and application fees for law school. He\u2019s a loyal Democrat, and although he said \u201cJoe Biden is not the best,\u201d he is voting for him.\n\nJeremy Bautista. Serge Stambolyan\n\nA class assignment on municipal candidates motivated Jeremy Bautista, 20, a Lehigh Carbon business major, to vote for the first time last year in local Allentown elections. But he\u2019s unsure whether he wants to vote again; neither Biden nor Trump has eased his concerns about his economic future.\n\n\u201cAm I going to be able to live on my own by the age of 23?\u201d he said. \u201cAm I going to be able to have that independence?\u201d\n\nWhen immigration is personal\n\nMany of the young Latino college students interviewed are children of immigrants, with previously or still undocumented family members, and they see immigration as a deeply personal issue. They chafed \u2014 and some became emotional \u2014 while discussing the threats of increased immigration enforcement and deportations.\n\nIn Georgia, Ramirez recalled spending his summers picking grapes with his family, starting at age 10. He saw Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrest and detain his father, leaving his mother to struggle to make ends meet for their three children.\n\n\u201cIt was hard,\u201d Ramirez said through tears. \u201cIt was really unfair. Obviously, the exploitation was there, the wages weren\u2019t fair at all, and it hurt. But it shaped me.\u201d\n\nHernandez, the ASU student, said he often talks with fellow students about living under his state\u2019s harsh \u201cshow me your papers law\u201d and worries about a return to that anti-immigrant environment.\n\nNicholas Hernandez. Suzanne Gamboa / NBC News\n\n\u201cA lot of us talk about the trauma \u2026 of us losing our parents, seeing t\u00edos (uncles), t\u00edas (aunts), friends, parents hiding. My dad was afraid to drive around,\u201d said Hernandez. \u201cMy mother had to drive him everywhere.\u201d\n\nAt Dalton State College, Karla Hernandez, 21, a senior studying biology, had similar fears now that the state has passed new legislation, House Bill 1105, to crack down on undocumented immigrants following the slaying of nursing student Laken Riley at the University of Georgia. Most Hispanic students and locals who spoke to NBC News cited the bill as a cause of deep concern.\n\nKarla Hernandez. Courtesy Karla Hernandez\n\nHernandez said she learned about the bill through Instagram posts and looked it up. The bill, which is awaiting the governor\u2019s signature, could bring back a program known as 287(g) that partners local law enforcement with ICE to make arrests, conduct raids and other actions. The program has been a source of numerous complaints of racial profiling, denial of due process and family separations.\n\n\u201cIt was like there is no way this is actually happening, and it was, so that\u2019s really shocking,\u201d she said.\n\nASU\u2019s Rouse said her research shows there\u2019s diversity of opinion in border counties and cities when it comes to immigration, even among young people, with some supporting more immigration restrictions because of the way increased migration has affected their communities. That could work in Republicans\u2019 favor.\n\nFor more from NBC Latino, sign up for our weekly newsletter.\n\nTrump has vowed that, if elected, he\u2019ll conduct massive deportation sweeps and wants to end birthright citizenship. As president, he tried to get rid of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which Biden supports.\n\nThe issue for Democrats is whether these differences can mobilize young Latino voters to abandon thoughts of a third-party candidate.\n\nA mobilization tipping point?\n\nA few days after Arizona\u2019s Supreme Court upheld an 1864 law imposing a near total ban on abortions, Guerrero, the biology student at ASU, said in a text that the court\u2019s decision makes him feel more compelled to vote, though he hadn\u2019t decided how he\u2019ll vote.\n\nAcross the board, regardless of political leanings, young Latino college students supported abortion rights.\n\nMariajose Leon, 19, a freshman studying biomedical science and Spanish at ASU, said abortion is a human rights issue that is \u201cvery black and white \u2014 women should have the right to decide.\u201d\n\nJuan Carlos Avitia. Suzanne Gamboa / NBC News\n\nJuan Carlos Avitia, 18, an ASU freshman studying aerospace engineering, said he leans Republican. He said women should have the right to choose, with some limits. \u201cI don\u2019t like big government, but I think there should be restrictions,\u201d he said.\n\nAbortion has been a mobilizing issue for Democrats: About 4 in 10 (42%) young Latino voters nationally said that the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade and state laws restricting abortion motivated them to vote in the 2022 midterms, according to a Brookings report.\n\nThat\u2019s why Alyssa C\u00e1ceres, 20, a student at Lehigh Carbon, voted for the first time in that midterm. This year, she\u2019s unhappy with the prospect of Biden and Trump on the ballot again, but does plan to vote.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m unsettled. I\u2019m picking between the lesser of two evils,\u201d she said. \u201cThere should be a third choice that\u2019s better.\u201d\n\nFellow Lehigh Carbon student Margaret Rodr\u00edguez S\u00e1nchez, 20, is still on the fence about registering to vote. But she said reproductive rights would be \u201cvery important when it comes to my voting.\u201d\n\nMargaret Rodriguez Sanchez. Serge Stambolyan\n\nRouse, the ASU Hispanic Research Center director, said the Israel-Gaza conflict and immigration seemed to be drowning out the abortion issue, and she was unsure if it would be as mobilizing as Democrats hoped. But it\u2019s back on the radar, she said.\n\nThis year, Democrats started their outreach and messaging to prospective Latino voters earlier and have been amping it up with just seven months to go before Election Day.\n\nBut in a tight race boiling down to what happens in a few swing states, challenges remain \u2014 especially for Biden. Young voters, Rouse said, aren\u2019t engaging with what she describes as \u201cexistential threats\u201d to democracy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really hard message to get across to young people,\u201d she said.\n\nCORRECTION (April 29, 2024, 5:51 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the designation of Dalton State College. It is Georgia\u2019s first Hispanic-serving institution, not its only one.\n\nSuzanne Gamboa reported from Tempe and Phoenix, Arizona; Nicole Acevedo from Allentown and Schnecksville, Pennsylvania; and Isabela Espadas Barros Leal from Dalton, Georgia.",

        "text": "Panama Picks a New President\nWelcome back to Foreign Policy\u2019s Latin America Brief.\n\nThe highlights this week: Panama elects a controversial new president, floods pummel southern Brazil, and Netflix bets big on a Colombian production.\n\nSign up to receive Latin America Brief in your inbox every Friday.\n\nPanama Goes to the Polls\n\nIn the past three decades, Panama has generally outpaced its Latin American peers in economic growth. Its economy grew by an average of 5.9 percent annually between 1990 and 2019, driven in part by revenues from the Panama Canal. The country, a logistics hub, has also experienced booms in civil construction and mining.\n\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic, however, Panama has entered more uncertain political and economic terrain. A drought has reduced activity in the Panama Canal. Increasing numbers of migrants traveling through the Dari\u00e9n Gap, Panama\u2019s jungle border with Colombia, have strained humanitarian services. Last year, authorities shuttered the country\u2019s most profitable copper mine, which accounted for an estimated 3.5 percent of Panama\u2019s GDP in 2021.\n\nSunday\u2019s general election may have delivered Panama a new leader, but many voters are skeptical that he can find lasting solutions to the country\u2019s problems. The winner, Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino, was a stand-in candidate for former President Ricardo Martinelli, who was disqualified due to a money laundering conviction. (Outgoing center-left President Laurentino Cortizo was barred from running due to a ban on immediate reelection.)\n\nMartinelli governed Panama from 2009 to 2014, during an economic boom. Despite his legal woes, many Panamanians remain loyal to Martinelli. Mulino, who served as Martinelli\u2019s security minister and referenced the economic abundance of Martinelli\u2019s tenure on the campaign trail, earned around 34 percent of votes on Sunday\u2014enough for victory in Panama\u2019s one-round presidential race.\n\nMulino\u2019s closest competitor was anti-corruption outsider Ricardo Lombana, who received around 25 percent of votes. Candidates from more traditional parties trailed further behind. The most unusual result came in Panama\u2019s legislature, where independent candidates collectively won more seats than any political party. This, paired with Lombana\u2019s success, suggests that many Panamanians are hungry for an anti-corruption agenda.\n\nHowever, their cohort wasn\u2019t big enough to chip away at Mulino and Martinelli\u2019s support base at the presidential level. For Panama\u2019s top office, \u201ccorruption won, but democratically,\u201d renowned Panamanian salsa musician and politician Rub\u00e9n Blades fretted on his blog on Sunday. International observers celebrated that Panama\u2019s election was free and fair. Mulino met with Cortizo on Tuesday afternoon to begin planning the handover.\n\nIn comments since being elected, Mulino pledged to reunite the country and improve access to jobs and safe water. He has generally held center-right economic views. Owners of the copper mine that Cortizo\u2019s government shuttered late last year are optimistic that Mulino could take a different stance on the matter; they issued a public statement saying they looked forward to talks.\n\nMulino refrained from commenting publicly on the mine during the campaign. But he did speak up in ads about stopping illegal immigration. In one interview, he committed to \u201cclosing\u201d the Dari\u00e9n Gap; migration experts have warned that such a move is logistically unviable.\n\nOne question that remains is whether Mulino will pardon Martinelli. Currently, the former president is holed up in the Nicaraguan Embassy, where he was granted political asylum, in Panama City. Mulino visited him there on election day.\n\nUpcoming Events\n\nSunday, May 19: The Dominican Republic holds general elections.\n\nWednesday, May 22: The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development hosts a conference on economic and trade policies in Latin America.\n\nSunday, June 2: Mexico holds general elections.\n\nWhat We\u2019re Following\n\nU.S. policy watch. On April 30, Time published a lengthy interview with former U.S. President Donald Trump. Then, on Tuesday, U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan gave a speech about U.S. policy toward Latin America. Together, the two events offered clues as to what either outcome of this year\u2019s U.S. presidential election might mean for the future of Washington\u2019s policy toward the region.\n\nSpeaking with Time, Trump repeated his pledge to impose a 10 percent tariff on goods from all foreign countries, adding that he would introduce a 100 percent tariff on cars built at plants run by Chinese companies in Mexico. (Such moves would typically require congressional approval.) Trump also said he would be willing to use the U.S. military to conduct mass deportations of millions of people living illegally in the United States.\n\nSeparately, Rolling Stone reported this week that Trump has privately endorsed plans to deploy covert military squads into Mexico to assassinate drug bosses.\n\nSullivan, for his part, addressed a Council of the Americas event in Washington on Tuesday, providing an overview of U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s policies toward the region that included a pledge to make the Americas the \u201cmost economically competitive region in the world.\u201d (Trump\u2019s policy advisors have also pushed a nearshoring agenda, but Biden has not pledged equivalent tariff hikes.)\n\nTo fight organized crime, Sullivan pledged law enforcement partnerships and efforts to crack down on gun trafficking; to address migration, he said Biden believes in \u201cstronger and humane\u201d border enforcement and an increase in legal migration pathways.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida visits a monument commemorating Japanese immigration to Brazil in S\u00e3o Paulo on May 4.\n\nA Japan-Mercosur moment? Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida visited Brazil and Paraguay last week, touting the possibility of a free trade deal with the South American customs union Mercosur. In addition to Brazil and Paraguay, the group includes Argentina, Bolivia, and Uruguay; it signed its first trade deal with an Asian country\u2014Singapore\u2014in December.\n\nBrazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva and Paraguayan President Santiago Pe\u00f1a voiced support for a possible deal with Japan. Kishida\u2019s overture comes amid frustrations over a long-stalled agreement between Mercosur and the European Union.\n\nIn Brazil, Kishida signed dozens of memorandums of understanding, including one between the two countries\u2019 export promotion agencies. Brazil is home to the largest Japanese diaspora in the world, and Kishida spoke about those ties on a visit to a cultural center in S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Japanese neighborhood of Liberdade.\n\nDespite the bonhomie, by the end of Kishida\u2019s visit there was no sign that Lula had been successful in his long-running mission to get Japan to open its market to Brazilian beef exports. \u201cPlease take Prime Minister Fumio to eat steak at the best restaurant in S\u00e3o Paulo so that \u2026 he starts importing our beef,\u201d Lula said during the leaders\u2019 joint press conference.\n\nNetflix news. Last month, Netflix released the trailer for its largest-ever Latin American production: One Hundred Years of Solitude, an adaptation of Colombian writer Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019s magnum opus. A sprawling set depicting the fictional town of Macondo at three points in time has been constructed around six hours outside Bogot\u00e1, where the Spanish-language show is being filmed under the direction of Colombia\u2019s Laura Mora and Argentina\u2019s \u00c1lex Garc\u00eda L\u00f3pez.\n\nThe series, due to be released later this year, reflects how Netflix has managed to outperform its U.S.-based streaming competitors. The platform has left companies such as Warner Brothers and Disney in the dust in part by betting big on non-English-language content that tells stories specific to their local contexts.\n\nLatin America, with its some 700 million-strong population and high television viewing rates, was an early part of that international production strategy, Bloomberg reported. Additional new Netflix shows from the region include a biopic about a star Formula 1 driver being filmed in Brazil and a science fiction series currently under production in Argentina.\n\nQuestion of the Week\n\nNetflix\u2019s hit Mexican series La Casa de las Flores is about a family that owns what kind of business? A cabaret A funeral home A ranch A car dealership The family also owns a flower shop; each is called La Casa de Las Flores.\n\nFP\u2019s Most Read This Week\n\nIn Focus: Brazil\u2019s Floods\n\nAn aerial view of floods in Eldorado do Sul, in the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul, on May 9.\n\nUnusually heavy rains last week have plunged the southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul into the worst extreme weather event in its history. The deaths of at least 107 people from flooding and mudslides were recorded by early Thursday. The business district of the state capital of Porto Alegre was submerged under several feet of water, as was the city\u2019s international airport, where flights were canceled through the end of the month.\n\nAn initial government response package of more than $9 billion was announced Thursday, with damage costs expected to rise. The disaster was a scenario about which scientists have long cautioned. A climate adaptation plan commissioned by Brazil\u2019s presidency a decade ago warned of increased flooding in Rio Grande do Sul, where several rivers drain into the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nHowever, the document was shelved soon after being produced, and its recommendations went largely ignored. The state\u2019s government and its federal lawmakers have a record of dismantling environmental protections.\n\nThe ongoing El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon, which typically brings heavy rains to Rio Grande do Sul, is partially responsible for the scale of the devastation in the state. But a long-term trend of higher temperatures has made the rain more dangerous, in this case overwhelming a dam system that had been designed to contain floodwaters.\n\nThe combination of El Ni\u00f1o, climate change, and local natural resource mismanagement is subjecting other parts of the region to extreme events as well. Bogot\u00e1 and Mexico City are currently experiencing water shortages. In Mexico, high temperatures have led to rolling blackouts across the country.\n\nPublic outcry over such disasters has the potential to be politically explosive. Hopefully, it can be constructive, Brazilian journalist Bernardo Mello Franco wrote in O Globo: \u201cPoliticizing the climate tragedy is necessary,\u201d as \u201cpolitical choices give origin to increasingly frequent extreme events.\u201d",

Trump withdrew the US from the Iran nuclear deal negotiated by his predecessor, Barack Obama, and imposed crippling sanctions on the country as part of his 'maximum pressure' campaign .",
        "text": "Why a possible second Trump presidency makes Iran nervous\nThere\u2019s been much talk in recent months about what a possible second Donald Trump presidency in the United States could mean for Europe, Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, the Israel-Palestinian conflict and China. But there\u2019s one more country closely watching the race: Iran.\n\nAnother Trump presidency could pose immense risks for the Iranian leadership, especially given the recent tit-for-tat strikes with Israel, the looming threat of a wider Middle East war, and other significant internal challenges.\n\nUnder such conditions, there are three ways a new Trump administration might pose a threat to the clerical establishment: a potential economic shock, bolder military action against the regime and increased protest movements.\n\nRenewed economic pressure\n\nIn 2018, Trump withdrew the US from the Iran nuclear deal negotiated by his predecessor, Barack Obama, and imposed crippling sanctions on the country as part of his \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign on the Iranian government.\n\nIran\u2019s then-vice president, Eshagh Jahangiri, described the subsequent year as the \u201ctoughest\u201d since the Islamic Republic\u2019s inception. Trump\u2019s campaign reduced Iran\u2019s oil exports to a historic low of under 400,000 barrels per day, significantly slashing the country\u2019s petrodollars, which represent about 70% of government revenues. Moreover, between 2018 and 2020, Iran\u2019s national currency depreciated by more than 600%.\n\nAfter Joe Biden was elected president in 2020, Iran has managed to increase its oil exports. It was recently reported that Iran\u2019s oil exports have reached a six-year high of around 1.56 million barrels per day in the first three month of 2024. Republicans in the US blame the Biden administration for not enforcing sanctions against Iran, while the White House insists they are.\n\n\u201cThere are concrete signs of this nervousness already \u2013 Trump\u2019s sweep of the Republican nominating contests earlier this year coincided with a 20% fall in the value of the Iranian rial.\u201d\n\nWith Iran\u2019s economy still weakened, Trump\u2019s potential return could bring a new wave of pressure. Iran\u2019s Chamber of Commerce, Industries, Mines and Agriculture has noted, for instance, that a Trump return will cause Iran\u2019s oil exports to \u201csuffer again\u201d.\n\nThe head of Iran\u2019s Parliament Research Centre has also highlighted the country\u2019s current budget deficit of US$3.7 billion, warning a Trump return would necessitate being ready for \u201cincreased sanctions pressure and an economic shock\u201d.\n\nAnother economics expert, Morteza Afghe, struck a more dire note when he warned of a potential \u201ccollapse of Iran\u2019s economy\u201d. Due to Iran\u2019s more strident anti-Western policies under President Ebrahim Raisi and the dominance of radical factions in parliament, Afghe believes Trump would be even more determined to escalate his \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign on the country.\n\nThere are concrete signs of this nervousness already \u2013 Trump\u2019s sweep of the Republican nominating contests earlier this year coincided with a 20% fall in the value of the Iranian rial.\n\nSecurity implications\n\nOn the security front, Trump\u2019s possible return is reminding the Iranian leadership of a significant loss under his presidency: the 2020 killing of General Qassem Soleimani, the former commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps\u2019 Quds Force, in a US airstrike.\n\nWhen he was killed, Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, described Soleimani as the architect behind the Iran-backed militia networks in the Middle East, known as the \u201caxis of resistance\u201d. Khamenei also said he \u201cbows to Soleimani\u201d for his achievements with the Quds Force. This illustrates the profound impact the US strike had on Iran\u2019s security interests.\n\nA recent Israeli airstrike on the Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria\u2019s capital this month also killed seven members of the Quds force, including two generals. This led to Iran\u2019s unprecedented retaliatory attack against Israel, which Trump responded to by reposting a threatening tweet from 2018.\n\nHe also said at a rally:\n\n[Israel is] under attack right now. That\u2019s because we show great weakness. [\u2026] It would not have happened if we were in office.\n\nGiven this rhetoric and the heightened tensions with Israel, a potential Trump return could make the Iranian leadership feel even more vulnerable. It could, for instance, lead to increased US or Israeli military action against Iranian proxy militias in Iraq and Syria, or potentially bolder strikes against Iran itself.\n\nEven before the recent Israel-Iran tensions, Mehdi Mohammadi, an advisor to Iran\u2019s parliament speaker on strategic affairs, said Iran\u2019s national security could face \u201cvery difficult\u201d years under another Trump presidency, reintroducing the prospect of \u201cmaximum threats\u201d against Tehran.\n\nIncreasing unrest at home\n\nElections were held earlier this year for Iran\u2019s parliament and the Assembly of Experts, the body that appoints the supreme leader. The official voter turnout was reported at just 41%. In the capital of Tehran, turnout was only 24%, the lowest in the history of the Islamic Republic.\n\nThis marks the third time in four years \u2014 including two parliamentary elections and one presidential election \u2014 in which voter turnout was below 50%. Prior to 2020, voter turnout typically exceeded 60% or even 70%.\n\nGiven these declining rates of voter participation and three major, nationwide protest movements since 2017, Iran\u2019s leadership is in the midst of the most serious legitimacy crisis in the Islamic Republic\u2019s history.\n\nThis has coincided with the 2021 election of the hardliner Raisi as president and this year\u2019s election, in which radical factions strengthened their position by winning many seats in the new parliament. These lawmakers want Iran to more forcefully challenge the U.S. and its allies and implement even harsher restrictions on domestic life, including stronger internet censorship and enforcement of Sharia law.\n\nWithin the country, media outlets have suggested the rise of unpopular, ultraconservative political figures could further deepen public dissatisfaction with the regime. In such conditions, possible economic repercussions from a second Trump presidency could fuel a new wave of nationwide protests in the country.\n\nAnd if Trump is elected, Iran\u2019s supreme leader would be about 86 years old when he took office. A transfer of power in Iran during a Trump presidency could bring even more uncertainty at a very critical time in Iranian politics.\n\nAmin Naeni is a PhD candidate at Alfred Deakin Institute for Citizenship and Globalisation at Deakin University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

His alleged actions and the actions of others disrupted a joint session of the U.S. Congress convened to ascertain and count the electoral votes related to the 2020 presidential election.\n\nGerald a.k.a. \u201cJeremiah\u201d Powell, 51, of York, Pennsylvania, is charged in a criminal complaint filed in the District of Columbia with felony offense of civil disorder and misdemeanor offenses of entering or remaining in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly or disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly conduct in a Capitol building or grounds, and parading, demonstrating, or picketing in a Capitol building or grounds.\n\nThe FBI arrested Powell on May 9, 2024, in Pennsylvania, and his initial appearance today in the Middle District of Pennsylvania.\n\nAccording to court documents, Powell was identified as present among a crowd of rioters on the east front of the Capitol grounds at approximately 1:56 p.m. on Jan 6., 2021. Here, rioters and police were wrestling for control of a line of bike rack barricades and police barriers. Eventually, the police line was broken, and the crowd of rioters advanced toward the Capitol. Court documents say that Powell was amongst the first 20 rioters to move past the police line.\n\nInstead of advancing, however, Powell allegedly turned back as others surged forward. Standing next to where rioters had initially broken through the police line, it is alleged that Powell began to drag the barricades that were in front of police officers to the side, expanding the opening for rioters to move froward toward to the Capitol. Powell allegedly moved at least five barricades to the side before advancing toward the Capitol building himself.\n\nCourt documents say that Powell entered the Capitol at about 2:40 p.m. via the East Front Doors. As Powell entered the building, he waved an American flag and proceeded into the Rotunda. Inside the Rotunda, Powell marched around the permitter waving an American flag and rested it against a Jonathan Trumbull painting. Powell then produced a bullhorn from his backpack and used it for approximately one minute.\n\nPowell then made his way out of the Rotunda and yelled at a newly formed police line before exiting the building at approximately 2:52 p.m., waving his flag.\n\nThis case is being prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia and the Department of Justice National Security Division\u2019s Counterterrorism Section. Valuable assistance was provided by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe case is being investigated by the FBI\u2019s Philadelphia and Washington field offices. Valuable assistance was provided by the U.S. Capitol Police and the Metropolitan Police Department.\n\nIn the 40 months since Jan. 6, 2021, more than 1,424 individuals have been charged in nearly all 50 states for crimes related to the breach of the U.S. Capitol, including more than 500 individuals charged with assaulting or impeding law enforcement, a felony. The investigation remains ongoing.\n\nAnyone with tips can call 1-800-CALL-FBI (800-225-5324) or visit tips.fbi.gov.\n\nA complaint is merely an allegation, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.",

The implications are often serious and lifelong.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nNPR spoke with Francisca Mutapi, a professor of global health infection and immunity at the University of Edinburgh who has studied parasites for 25 years. She shared her insights on what might have happened to RFK Jr. \u2013 and the toll that parasitic worms take around the world. The conversation was edited for length and clarity.\n\nLet's start with RFK Jr. What we know about his particular case is vague. Do you have an instinct about what this worm might have been and how he might have been infected with it?\n\nSo I have absolutely no idea about his case. From what I have read, it might have been a particular infection known as Taeniasis. And Taeniasis is an infection you get from a tropical parasitic worm \u2013 the easy name is tapeworms [which can be carried by pigs].\n\nWhat happens is when you're infected with a tapeworm, usually from raw pork or undercooked pork, you ingest the eggs and those eggs will go on to hatch. And in their larvae form, they will spread throughout the body and, depending on what tissues in the body they end in, they cause a disease called cysticercosis.\n\nWhere might these larvae travel in the body and what harm can they bring?\n\nFor example, if the larvae end up in the eyes, they can cause blurred vision and blindness. If they end up in the muscle, they can cause weak muscles. But if they end up in any part of your central nervous system \u2013 your spine or brain \u2013 then they cause a form of disease that's called neurocysticercosis.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAnd this particular form of the disease will range depending on your immune system and your health status and where exactly those larvae have ended up. It can cause headaches and seizures. For example, the disease is the leading preventable cause of epilepsy worldwide. It can also cause issues with cognition. And some people have problems with balancing problems, with lack of attention and also confusion. Excess fluid in the brain can actually make this a very dangerous condition. And in very, very rare cases, people do die from neurocysticercosis.\n\nHow likely is this in a U.S. context?\n\nWhat tends to happen is that you are exposed to the parasites when traveling to areas where this disease is widespread. So Asia, for example, South America and in some parts of Africa. In the United States, according to theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, you have about 1,000 new cases hospitalized with cysticercosis every year.\n\nWhat are the treatment options?\n\nWell, first of all, these diseases are preventable with things like good food hygiene \u2013 making sure pork is well-cooked \u2013 good hand-washing and good sanitation, of course.\n\nBut if you fail to prevent [the disease], then it is treatable and the drugs work very well. Two widely used drugs that kill the larval stages are praziquantel and albendazole. They are usually good for doing two things: They can reduce or kill the parasites, and they can also reverse some of the pathological manifestations of the disease, such as inflammation. In extreme cases, you have to have surgery.\n\nTell us more broadly about the global burden of parasites and particularly worms?\n\nDiseases caused by parasitic worms are mostly part of a group of diseases called neglected tropical diseases and about 1.7 billion people are affected by NTDs.\n\nIn Africa alone, for example, we have over 200 million people who are affected by bilharzia, a disease caused by parasitic worms [that can trigger a series of health problems from anemia to blood in your urine to cognitive issues].\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSo it's a huge burden. If you take all the children in the world that have bilharzia and get them to hold hands, they would encircle the world one and a half times. That is the burden of just one of the 21 neglected tropical diseases.\n\nWhile we have few deaths [from diseases caused by parasitic worms], what we do have is a huge impact on day-to-day general health and ability to function.\n\nSo can you talk about the consequences of cysticercosis \u2013 or other parasitic worms?\n\nThink about having an epileptic seizure. You cannot hold down a job easily or long-term if you're having epileptic seizures. If [the worm goes to your eye and] impacts your vision, that affects the jobs you are able to do and your safety. If you have problems with balance, it makes it difficult to move around. So that the quality of life becomes really reduced.\n\nSimilarly bilharzia in my mother tongue \u2013 Shona from Zimbabwe \u2013 is called the disease of cognitive function. Some of the classic symptoms are children who are tired, have poor memory and poor cognition. One of the big improvements that we see whenever we treat children and we catch the disease early is that the academic performance goes up as well as their physical activity.\n\nWhat is being done to combat this globally \u2013 and is it enough?\n\nA lot is being done, but a lot more can be done. We have what we call preventative chemotherapy, which is treatment of populations at risk of disease \u2013 you give them the drugs and they catch the infection before it causes the serious disease manifestations. These drugs are mostly donated by international pharmaceutical companies.\n\nWe now need to accelerate these efforts so we can try and eliminate these kinds of diseases as quickly as possible. We can do that by increasing treatments. But we can do that by also being more innovative in our interventions. We can develop vaccines, for example.\n\nRFK Jr.'s spokesperson has said he contracted the parasite by traveling to places in Africa, South America, and Asia in his role as \"an environmental advocate.\" Is there anything people can do to protect themselves in these parts of the world?\n\nIn areas where we do have cysticercosis, you can improve the hygiene so that people do not make contact with the fecal matter or the urine of pigs. That kind of intervention is very, very cheap but very, very effective.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAnd as you note, even though the RFK JR. story is a bit ... unusual ... it does offer an opportunity to talk about the global problem of parasitic worms.",

        "text": "2024 will be last election \u2018decided by US citizens\u2019: Elon Musk\nCEO of Tesla and SpaceX Elon Musk (AFP photo)\n\nNEW DELHI: Elon Musk , the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and a prominent tech figure , recently ignited a political debate with his claim that the 2024 US presidential election could be the last to be decided by American citizens alone. This provocative statement, shared on his own social media platform X, reflects his concerns about the influence of illegal immigrants on electoral outcomes\u2014a topic that has long been a point of contention in US politics.Musk's comment was in response to a new bill passed by House Republicans that aims to include a citizenship question in the national census, a move opposed by the White House and unanimously by Democrat legislators.As per a report in the Independent, the bill, known as the Equal Representation Act, is designed to alter how congressional seats are allocated by excluding non-citizens from the population counts used in electoral apportionment. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson defended the legislation, arguing that it is common sense that \"only American citizens should be counted for electoral apportionment.\"This legislative change, if implemented, would potentially impact states with large immigrant populations\u2014both Democrat and Republican-leaning\u2014by possibly reducing their representation in Congress. Critics of the bill argue that it contravenes the Fourteenth Amendment, which mandates counting the \"whole number of persons\" in each state for census purposes. The Biden administration has expressed strong opposition to the bill, emphasizing a commitment to maintaining the census's accuracy and its historical tradition of non-political interference.Musk's statements highlight a deepening divide in American society and politics over immigration and its implications for democracy. He frames the issue as one of electoral integrity, suggesting that the Democratic Party's opposition to the bill is part of a broader strategy to increase their electoral base through immigration, thus \"disenfranchising\" US citizens. This aligns with a broader narrative among some Republicans who view immigration as a threat to the electoral process.However, this perspective is highly contested.Research and data from organizations like the American Immigration Council show that a significant portion of the US immigrant population is comprised of naturalized citizens eligible to vote, countering the argument that non-citizens are improperly influencing US elections.",

They include Clarence Blalock, Shawn Harris, Deric Houston, and Joseph Leigh.\n\nThe general election is on Nov. 5, along with the presidential election.\n\nWill Greene win reelection?\n\nNo congressional districts in Georgia are likely to be competitive in November because of the way Republicans have drawn the district lines that keeps their advantage.\n\nIn Georgia\u2019s 14th district, this means that Greene is likely to win again. The Cook Political Report, a political forecasting newsletter, lists Greene\u2019s seat as \u201csolid Republican.\u201d\n\nThis outcome is barring any unanticipated developments, including if Trump picks Greene as his running mate. While not necessarily a leading contender, she campaigned for Trump in Iowa and New Hampshire and has been transparent about her desire for the role.",

        "text": "Why the Jewish vote in this year's US elections matters more than ever\nThis year, more than ever, your Jewish vote for president of the United States really, really matters.\n\nWith the alarming rise of antisemitic incidents throughout the United States, your vote can help influence the questions of whether future American leaders will withdraw financial, military, and other means of support to Israel; continue to make unreasonable demands to increase humanitarian aid to Gaza; restrain Israel\u2019s actions against Hamas and Hezbollah; vacate Jewish neighborhoods in Judea and Samaria; and ultimately reward the terrorists who massacred Jews and promoted global antisemitism and a Palestinian state.\n\nQuestions and answers, based on interviews with Israeli voters from all over Israel, were answered by legislators from Michigan, one of the key swing states in the US. The consensus is that for Israel and the global Jewish community, this year\u2019s vote is crucial. Every vote counts.\n\n\u201cAccording to the US Embassy, there are approximately 600,000 American citizens residing permanently or temporarily in Israel, and of these, we estimate about 500,000 may be eligible to vote,\u201d said attorney Marc Zell, chairman of Republicans Overseas Israel.\n\nGideon, a resident of Ma\u2019aleh Hever in the Hebron Hills region, has made every effort to vote in presidential elections, although he admits the system for voting from abroad makes it challenging. In Israel since 1978, he was active in AACI and Vote from Israel, NGOs that encourage Americans to vote. Although he is a New York voter, a heavily blue state, he is hoping that his vote for Donald Trump will count. A voter marks a ballot during the primary election and abortion referendum at a Wyandotte County polling station in Kansas City, Kansas, U.S. August 2, 2022. (credit: ERIC COX/REUTERS)\n\n\u201cI think it is important to vote,\u201d stated Gideon. \u201cI understand there are more \u201cpurple states than usual, and voting in them is especially important.\u201d\n\nOne swing-state voter who plans to vote Republican said the last time she mailed her ballot she felt a thrill. \u201cThe thought that I could maybe make a difference all the way from here \u2013 not just for America, but for Israel, was a tremendous charge!\u201d\n\nMiriam Lane, an American-Israeli attorney who votes in Rockland County, New York, has lived in Ramat Bet Shemesh for almost 20 years.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very politically oriented,\u201d she said. \u201cMy family were Democrats and so was I, until one day I realized that I\u2019m a moderate liberal in terms of social programs. I believe in helping people and I\u2019m against discrimination, but I don\u2019t believe in the kind of extreme politics that is now more and more dominant. I believe in strong foreign policies.\n\n\u201cI hate labels but I identify with traditional family values, and I think intersectionality is off the mark. I am obviously very pro-Israel. We are a necessary ally for the United States and they need us as a bulwark against Iran, communist China, and others.\u201d Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Subscribe Now\n\nLane said she is likely to vote for Trump. \u201cI am unashamed to say that I liked Trump\u2019s policies. I think he was good for America and good for Israel. However, I am a little concerned that if president Trump were to get elected, there would be tremendous unrest.\n\n\u201cWhile there is already unrest in the United States, there has never been this level of antisemitism. One of the reasons I went to law school was because I believed in justice. Speech is protected by the First Amendment, but intimidation is not. How much of a future will there be if this continues?\u201d\n\nLane pointed out that 40% of college funding comes from the federal government.\n\n\u201cThe government should withhold funding from schools that don\u2019t protect students from harassment and intimidation,\u201d she suggested. \u201cI have never been this concerned. I live in Israel but I love America. I\u2019m hoping there might be a lot of couch people \u2013 nonvoters in New York, and even some who will vote Republican because they are afraid of what is going on.\u201d\n\nMy vote doesn\u2019t count\n\nDeborah moved from Chicago to the Samaria 30 years ago, and thought about voting in the upcoming election, but isn\u2019t sure it\u2019s worth the bother. \u201cI vote in a state that has traditionally leaned in only one direction. My vote doesn\u2019t count. Why should I bother voting?\u201d\n\nMichigan state Senator Lana Theis weighed in on the topic. \u201cAll citizens who are legally eligible to vote should do so. There is no way your voice can be heard if you don\u2019t vote, and this election promises to be like no other.\n\n\u201cThere are groups who have found agreement on issues that haven\u2019t previously been aligned, so relying on historical voting trends is going to be very difficult.\n\n\u201cNext, there are many more issues on a ballot than the individual at the top of the ticket. Even beyond state legislatures, there are college governing boards, township and school board candidates that all embody the \u2018all politics is local\u2019 philosophy and are so very important for day-to-day life.\n\n\u201cAlso, additional school, local government, or first responder taxes may be on those ballots as well, impacting on the one hand the level of service provided by local governments, but on the other hand affecting people\u2019s ability to afford their homes in times of financial distress.\n\n\u201cLastly, the margin that an individual politician wins by is considered important as well. If the politician has a \u2018mandate\u2019 due to a wide win-margin, they can get more of their agenda completed. You will remember claims of certain presidents winning the electoral college but not winning the popular vote \u2013 that narrative drove much of the public policy during their presidencies.\u201d\n\nIs this the best we can do?\n\nAlan, a recent oleh from Florida, said, \u201cI hate both candidates. If that is the best we can do in America, why should I vote?\u201d\n\nTheis answered, \u201cIn some cases, you are voting for the one that would not do significant harm to the things you prioritize. Rather than \u2018getting nothing good done,\u2019 they can create even worse scenarios because there is no stopping their agenda if the House, Senate and executive are all under singular party control. Think about the impact of excessive government spending causing inflation. Government constantly printing money and using taxpayer dollars for things like tuition \u2018forgiveness\u2019 payments already determined by SCOTUS [the Supreme Court of the United States] to be an unconstitutional use of funds are just a few examples that could be changed with different leadership.\n\n\u201cIn the case of Israel, the current US administration appears to be working to undermine what it perceives to be a conservative government (even though it is a consensus government, that is not how the Biden administration sees it) as Israel is trying to defend itself in war. The Biden administration is taking action that actively harms Israel in order to affect election outcomes and to pander for their electoral benefit in a swing state like Michigan.\u201d\n\nCan my information be compromised?\n\nSeveral Israeli Americans cited security concerns. Ra\u2019anana dual citizen Sherry said, \u201cI am afraid with the current ballot system, my identity might get stolen. How can I believe that my information is secure when I submit absentee ballots with my social security information?\u201d\n\n\u201cClerks must follow security protocols upon receiving your ballot,\u201d explains state Rep. Ann Bollin, a former township clerk from Michigan. \u201cOnly election officials can handle ballots, and the signature is checked against the signature on file. All ballots are secured with limited access by election officials. Upon receipt, all ballots are time and date stamped in the qualified voter file.\n\nAbsentee ballots are secret, and there is no identity information on the absent voter ballot (birth date, driver\u2019s license number, or even the last four numbers of the Social Security number).\n\nA frequent question attorney Marc Zell is asked is whether registering to vote in the United States can trigger the state to demand income taxes. His answer: \u201cLegally you are not required to pay taxes just because you vote.\u201d\n\nAlso, if you happen to be visiting, there are several options available to an absent voter to return their ballot, including personally delivering it to the clerk\u2019s office or obtaining their absent voter ballot in the clerk\u2019s office and voting it in the clerk\u2019s office. Also available to an absent voter is the option to return their ballot during the early voting period in a federal or statewide election.\n\nA resident of Givat Shmuel who maintains dual citizenship confided, \u201cI have heard that absentee ballots are counted last and only when there is a close tie, so why should I think that mine will be counted at all?\u201d\n\nNot true, explains Bollin. \u201cAll absentee ballots are counted if received on time. Further, the board of canvassers verifies the number of ballots sent, returned, and counted.\u201d\n\nTheis adds, \u201cDifferent states count them at different times. While in Michigan they used to be counted last, that is no longer the case with voting law changes; but they were always counted.\u201d\n\nWho is eligible to vote in the US from abroad?\n\nRuth, a Jerusalem-based resident who emigrated in her teens 35 years ago with her family, asked, \u201cI am an American citizen but I never voted in an American election. Can I still vote? And what about my adult children? Are they eligible to vote?\u201d\n\nThat, according to Zell, varies by state. Most of the United States allow anyone who once resided there, or had a parent, legal guardian, or spouse residing there once, to vote in that state, if he or she has not registered or voted in another state.\n\nHowever, 11 states, including Florida, Maryland, Texas, and Pennsylvania (a swing state), require that the voters themselves must have resided there at one time. In other words, if a parent from one of those states immigrated to Israel and children were born here who are now voting age, even if they maintained American citizenship, because they never resided there, they are ineligible to vote.\n\n\u201cNo state requires you to be physically present to vote there, and most permit online registration and ballot requests,\u201d Zell explains. \u201cWhile most states require ballots to be [snail] mailed or delivered to the local election, a handful of states permit online voting. There is a checkbox on the ballot that asserts that you are \u2018not sure\u2019 if you intend to live in your non-US home that allows the expat to vote absentee.\u201d\n\nBollin encourages anyone with questions about voting eligibility to visit the website www.fvap.gov. The federal site has hyperlinks to each individual state, with state laws detailed, and a copious question and answer section.\n\n\u201cIn addition, there are two laws that should also be reviewed based on an individual\u2019s situation,\u201d Bollin adds. \u201cThey are the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act and the Military and Overseas Voters Empowerment Act. I strongly advise Americans living overseas to read and refer to them.\u201d",

        "text": "U.S. says Israel\u2019s use of U.S. arms likely violated international law, but evidence is incomplete\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Biden administration said Friday that Israel\u2019s use of U.S.-provided weapons in Gaza likely violated international humanitarian law but wartime conditions prevented U.S. officials from determining that for certain in specific airstrikes.\n\nThe finding of \u201creasonable\u201d evidence to conclude that the U.S. ally had breached international law in its conduct of the war in Gaza, released in a summary of a report being delivered to Congress on Friday, represents the strongest such statement from Biden officials.\n\nBut the caveat that the U.S. was unable immediately to link specific U.S. weapons to individual strikes by Israeli forces in Gaza could give the administration leeway in any future decision on whether to restrict provisions of offensive weapons to Israel.\n\nThe first-of-its-kind assessment, which was compelled by President Joe Biden\u2019s fellow Democrats in Congress, comes after seven months of airstrikes, ground fighting and aid restrictions that have claimed the lives of nearly 35,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children.\n\nWATCH: UN General Assembly approves resolution granting new rights to Palestine, reviving membership bid\n\nWhile U.S. officials were unable to gather all the information they needed on specific strikes, \u201cgiven Israel\u2019s significant reliance on U.S.-made defense articles, it is reasonable to assess that defense articles \u2026 have been used by Israeli security forces since October 7 in instances inconsistent with its IHL obligations or with established best practices for mitigating civilian harm,\u201d the report said, using an abbreviation for international humanitarian law.\n\nWhile Israel\u2019s military has the experience, technology and know-how to minimize harm to civilians, \u201cthe results on the ground, including high levels of civilian casualties, raise substantial questions as to whether the IDF is using them effectively in all cases,\u201d the report said.\n\nBiden has tried to walk an ever-finer line in his support of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s war against Hamas. He has faced growing rancor at home and abroad over the soaring Palestinian death toll and the onset of famine, caused in large part by Israeli restrictions on the movement of food and aid into Gaza. Tensions have been heightened further in recent weeks by Netanyahu\u2019s pledge to expand the Israeli military\u2019s offensive in the crowded southern city of Rafah, despite Biden\u2019s adamant opposition.\n\nBiden is in the closing months of a tough reelection campaign against Donald Trump. He faces demands from many Democrats that he cut the flow of offensive weapons to Israel and denunciation from Republicans who accuse him of wavering on support for Israel at its time of need.\n\nThe Democratic administration took one of the first steps toward conditioning military aid to Israel in recent days when it paused a shipment of 3,500 bombs out of concern over Israel\u2019s threatened offensive on Rafah, a southern city crowded with more than a million Palestinians, a senior administration official said.\n\nREAD MORE: How watermelon imagery, a symbol of solidarity with Palestinians, spread around the world\n\nThe presidential directive, agreed to in February, obligated the Defense and State departments to conduct \u201can assessment of any credible reports or allegations that such defense articles and, as appropriate, defense services, have been used in a manner not consistent with international law, including international humanitarian law.\u201d\n\nThe agreement also obligated them to tell Congress whether they deemed that Israel has acted to \u201carbitrarily to deny, restrict, or otherwise impede, directly or indirectly,\u201d delivery of any U.S.-supported humanitarian aid into Gaza for starving civilians there.\n\nLawmakers and others who advocated for the review said Biden and previous American leaders have followed a double standard when enforcing U.S. laws governing how foreign militaries use U.S. support, an accusation the Biden administration denies. They had urged the administration to make a straightforward legal determination of whether there was credible evidence that specific Israeli airstrikes on schools, crowded neighborhoods, medical workers, aid convoys and other targets, and restrictions on aid shipments into Gaza, violated the laws of war and human rights.\n\nTheir opponents argued that a U.S. finding against Israel would weaken it at a time it is battling Hamas and other Iran-backed groups. Any sharply critical findings on Israel are sure to add to pressure on Biden to curb the flow of weapons and money to Israel\u2019s military and further heighten tensions with Netanyahu\u2019s hard-right government over its conduct of the war against Hamas.\n\nAny finding against Israel also could endanger Biden\u2019s support in this year\u2019s presidential elections from some voters who keenly support Israel.\n\nREAD MORE: More Israeli air raids in Rafah kill 22 people, mostly children, as U.S. advances aid package\n\nAt the time the White House agreed to the review, it was working to head off moves from Democratic lawmakers and independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont to start restricting shipments of weapons to Israel.\n\nIsrael launched its offensive after an Oct. 7 assault into Israel, led by Hamas, killed about 1,200 people. Two-thirds of the Palestinians killed since then have been women and children, according to local health officials. U.S. and U.N. officials say Israeli restrictions on food shipments since Oct. 7 have brought on full-fledged famine in northern Gaza.\n\nHuman rights groups long have accused Israeli security forces of committing abuses against Palestinians and have accused Israeli leaders of failing to hold those responsible to account. In January, in a case brought by South Africa, the top U.N. court ordered Israel to do all it could to prevent death, destruction and any acts of genocide in Gaza, but the panel stopped short of ordering an end to the military offensive.\n\nIsrael says it is following all U.S. and international law, that it investigates allegations of abuse by its security forces and that its campaign in Gaza is proportional to the existential threat it says is posed by Hamas.\n\nBiden in December said \u201cindiscriminate bombing\u201d was costing Israel international backing. After Israeli forces targeted and killed seven aid workers from the World Central Kitchen in April, the Biden administration for the first time signaled it might cut military aid to Israel if it didn\u2019t change its handling of the war and humanitarian aid.\n\nPresidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, in the 1980s and early 1990s, were the last presidents to openly hold back weapons or military financing to try to push Israel to change its actions in the region or toward Palestinians.\n\nA report to the Biden administration by an unofficial, self-formed panel including military experts, academics and former State Department officials detailed Israeli strikes on aid convoys, journalists, hospitals, schools and refugee centers and other sites. They argued that the civilian death toll in those strikes \u2014 such as an Oct. 31 strike on an apartment building reported to have killed 106 civilians \u2014 was disproportionate to the blow against any military target.\n\nZeke Miller and Mike Balsamo contributed.",

Despite this disagreement, Ramaswamy expressed respect for Coulter's forthrightness in expressing her views.The conversation unfolded as Coulter took swipes at Ramaswamy, who had attempted a presidential run before eventually supporting Donald Trump 's candidacy. Coulter praised Ramaswamy's intelligence and articulacy but reiterated her decision not to support him due to his Indian ethnicity.\"Ann Coulter told me flat-out to my face that she couldn't vote for me 'because you're an Indian,' even though she agreed with me more than most other candidates. I disagree with her but respect she had the guts to speak her mind,\" said Ramaswamy in a post on X Coulter's comment, specifically her use of the term \"articulate\" in reference to Ramaswamy, drew attention online. Some defended Coulter's comments, while others criticized them as discriminatory . Ramaswamy's presidential bid saw initial support from Donald Trump, who refrained from criticizing him due to Ramaswamy's staunch defense of the former president.In response to the podcast, reactions poured in from various quarters. While some condemned Coulter's stance as \"Indophobic\" and \"bigoted,\" others supported her, citing Ramaswamy's advocacy for Indian immigrant accessibility in the US.Earlier this year, Ramaswamy withdrew from the US presidential race , endorsing Donald Trump and pledging his support to further the \"America First\" movement. He congratulated Trump on his victory and expressed confidence in Trump's ability to lead the country.\"I called Donald Trump to tell him I congratulate him on his victory. Now, going forward, he will have my full endorsement for the presidency. And I think we\u2019re going to do the right thing for this country. And so I\u2019m going to ask you, to follow me in taking our America First movement to the next level,\u201d Ramaswamy had said.",

        "text": "Joe Biden wants to remind 2024 voters of a record and an agenda. Often it\u2019s Donald Trump\u2019s\nSEATTLE (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden is running for reelection on a record and an agenda -- often Donald Trump\u2019s.\n\nIn a hotel ballroom in Seattle, at fancy homes in California and at stops in Illinois and Wisconsin over the past week, Biden has been betting that reminding voters about Trump\u2019s presidency and highlighting his Republican opponent\u2019s latest campaign statements will work to the Democrat\u2019s advantage.\n\nAt a Seattle fundraiser Friday night, Biden brought up Trump\u2019s recent interview with Time magazine in which Trump said states should be left to determine whether to prosecute women for abortions or to monitor their pregnancies.\n\n\u201cI really urge you to read it,\u201d Biden said.\n\nBiden, who headlined another Seattle fundraiser Saturday before returning to the East Coast, has plenty of other Trump material to draw from, too.\n\nThe president highlights how Trump has promised, if elected, to be \u201ca dictator on Day 1\u201d, how he has suggested the United States would not necessarily defend allies from aggression and how he has pledged to \u201ctotally obliterate the deep state\u201d in the federal bureaucracy, which he blames for blocking his first-term agenda.\n\n\u201cAnd he said a whole lot more,\u201d Biden said during a Chicago appearance. \u201cBut the bad news is he means what he says. He means what he says. Unless you think I\u2019m kidding, just think back to the 6th of January. This guy means what he says,\u201d referring to the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nBiden wants the 2024 election to be a referendum on Trump\u2019s record and plans, but he also wants voters to look favorably on his own policies and actions.\n\nBiden and his allies think the country needs reminding about Trump\u2019s tenure and his outlandish and often concerning statements, particularly because the Republican is no longer ubiquitous on X, formerly Twitter, nor is he in front of television cameras as often as he once was.\n\n\u201cChaos is nothing new for Trump,\u201d Biden said in Chicago. \u201cHis presidency was chaos. Trump is trying to make the -- the country forget about the dark and unsettling things that he did when he was president. Well, we\u2019re going to not let them forget.\u201d\n\nBiden frequently highlights Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election and how he stood by when supporters violently stormed the Capitol as Congress met to certify his loss to Biden. He also points to Trump separating children from their families at the U.S.-Mexico border, tax cuts the Republican pushed through that benefited corporations and the wealthy and his repeated efforts to overturn the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBiden\u2019s barbs have been getting sharper of late.\n\nHe opened his Seattle fundraiser on Friday night by telling donors, \u201cThank you for the warm welcome. Please keep it down, because Donald Trump is sleeping. Sleepy Don.\u201d That was a riff off of news reports that the former president has dozed off during his criminal trial in a New York courtroom. Trump has pleaded not guilty to charges in a hush money scheme to illegally influence the 2016 presidential election.\n\nBiden also talks about Trump\u2019s admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin and his self-described \u201clove letters\u201d with Kim Jong Un, the authoritarian leader of North Korea.\n\nBiden frequently jabs at Trump for wondering aloud during the COVID-19 pandemic whether disinfectants could be injected or ingested to fight the virus. \u201cThat bleach he didn\u2019t inject in his body; he just put it in his hair,\u201d Biden says to laughter every time. \u201cBut, look, he\u2019s got more hair than I do.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign said in a statement that \u201ctheir records speak for themselves. President Trump created the most secure border in history and peace in the world. President Trump was the first president in modern history not to enter the U.S. in any new wars. Joe Biden\u2019s weakness has led to wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, an immigrant invasion of our border, anti-Semitic protests on our college campuses, and crime and chaos in every American city.\u201d\n\nTrump doesn\u2019t hesitate to criticize Biden and his policies. Trump is spending much of his time lately sitting in court. But before and after the proceedings, he often stands in front of cameras outside the courtroom and goes after Biden.\n\nAt a recent Wisconsin rally, Trump mentioned Biden within the first 2\u00bd minutes of his speech and referenced the president or his administration more than 60 times during his remarks.\n\nTrump\u2019s criticism often takes a dark turn. Last weekend, he told donors at his Florida resort that Biden was running a \u201cGestapo administration.\u201d\n\nThe Gestapo was the secret police force of the Third Reich that squelched political opposition generally and, specifically, targeted Jewish people for arrest during the Holocaust. Trump\u2019s unfounded comparison to Nazi-era tactics is part of his effort to deny and deflect the charges against him, most notably his effort to overturn Biden\u2019s 2020 victory.\n\nBiden\u2019s strategy is a gamble. Voters are divided in their views of both men\u2019s presidencies.\n\nAn April poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that nearly half thought Trump\u2019s presidency hurt the country on voting rights and election security, relations with foreign countries, abortion laws and climate change. But more than half of U.S. adults thought Biden\u2019s presidency hurt the country on cost of living and immigration.\n\nFor all his criticism of Trump, Biden does get around to talking about his agenda and accomplishments. He tells supporters about his work to boost the economy and to bring the country out of the pandemic. He discusses his support for abortion rights even as he highlights how Trump has taken credit for the overturning of Roe v. Wade in part because of his Supreme Court nominations.\n\n\u201cFolks, the choice is clear,\u201d Biden told supporters recently in the nation\u2019s capital. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s vision of America is one of revenge and retribution.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been more optimistic about America\u2019s chances,\u201d he went on. \u201cNot because I\u2019m president, because of the state of the moment. The world needs us.\u201d\n\n___\n\nLong reported from Washington. AP White House Correspondent Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this report.",

The US general election takes place on 05 November 2024. (Estados Unidos) EFE/EPA/ALLISON DINNER ALLISON DINNER EFE\n\nThe 2024 United States presidential election is here, and with it comes a fundamental question: when will we know who the next president will be? While many people anticipate an immediate answer on election night, the reality is much more complicated. In this article, we will explore the key questions related to determining the winner of the 2024 U.S. presidential race beteween Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.\n\nWhen is the 2024 Presidential Election?\n\nThe 2024 U.S. presidential election will take place on Tuesday, November 5. On this day, voters across the country will head to the polls to choose their preferred presidential candidate, as well as other federal and local officials. However, the date itself is not the final answer to when we will know the winner.\n\nWhen are the votes counted?\n\nThe counting of votes is a process that begins on Election Day itself, but it doesn't happen immediately. As polling places close, results are reported by local and state officials, but this doesn't mean that all the votes have been counted. Many states allow early or mail-in voting, meaning that a significant portion of the votes may not be processed until days or even weeks after November 5.\n\nWhy can it take so long to know the winner?\n\nThere are several reasons why there may be a significant delay in the final count. First, mail-in ballots are more complicated to count quickly, especially in states with laws allowing a large volume of early votes. Additionally, some states allow ballots to be received up to several days after Election Day, as long as they are postmarked before the election. This process, along with identity verification and resolving legal disputes over ballots, can delay the final announcement of the winner.\n\nWho decides who wins?\n\nThe President of the United States is not elected directly by the popular vote but through the Electoral College, a system based on the votes of each state. Each state has a set number of electors, determined by its population, and a candidate needs at least 270 of the 538 electoral votes available to win.\n\nBecause of this, the counting of votes at the state level is crucial in determining when a winner can be declared. Only after the vote counting in key states is complete and it is clear how the electoral votes will be allocated can a final announcement be made.\n\nWhat if the results are very close?\n\nIf the results are very close in key states, there may be recounts. Some states have laws that require an automatic recount if the margin between the two leading candidates is below a certain percentage of the total votes cast.\n\nThis process can delay the announcement of the winner even further, as every ballot must be reviewed to ensure there are no errors or irregularities. Recounts can take weeks, depending on the size of the election and any legal disputes that arise.\n\nWhen can a winner in the 2024 Election be declared?\n\nUnder normal circumstances, media outlets and election authorities begin to project a winner on election night, based on partial vote counts. However, these projections are not official until the results are certified by state election officials, which can take several days or even weeks. The final certification of results typically occurs between mid-November and early December, but only then is the winner officially known after meetings on next December 17th.\n\nIn some recent elections, voters have had a much shorter wait. In 2016, when Donald Trump won the presidency, he was declared the winner shortly before 03:00 EST the day after the election. In 2012, when Barack Obama secured a second term, his victory was projected before midnight on polling day itself.\n\nHowever, the 2000 and 2020 elections were notable exceptions. On the race between George W Bush and Al Gore, the vote was held on 7 November, but the two campaigns went to war over a tight contest in Florida and the race was not decided until 12 December.\n\nIn 2020, the election took place on Tuesday 3 November. However, US TV networks did not declare Joe Biden the winner until late morning on Saturday 7 November, after the result in Pennsylvania became clearer.\n\nWhen does the new president take office?\n\nAlthough the winner may not be officially declared until December, the presidential inauguration takes place on January 20, 2025. On this date, the president-elect will take the oath of office and assume the role, regardless of any potential delays in the vote counting or certification process.\n\nThis ensures that, even though the election process may extend beyond November, the transition of power occurs in an orderly fashion, as mandated by the U.S. Constitution.",

        "text": "DIY Guide Presidential Election \u2013 The 13 Keys to the White House by Allan Lichtman\nBy Bj\u00f6rn-Michael Lange\n\nSignificance of the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election\n\nThe United States of America remain, by any measure, the most powerful nation on earth. Despite having just over 4 percent of the world\u00b4s population, it accounts for 26.3 percent of the Global GDP, 32 percent of the world\u2019s liquid investable assets and nearly 40 percent of global military spending as of 2023. The U.S. president is, simply put, the most powerful person in the world.\n\nThe Stakes of the Trump-Biden Rematch Could Not Be Higher\n\nThe upcoming 2024 U.S. presidential election could be the most consequential one since 1860. Former President Trump is making unprecedented statements, and his plans would fundamentally alter American democracy. The outcome of this election is of utmost importance to the U.S. American people and their allies worldwide. It will determine the future of U.S. democracy and the rule of law, the timing and extent of further military aid to Ukraine and Israel, and the U.S. military posture in the Pacific. The election will also shape the future of NATO and of European security, considering the roughly 100,000 U.S. troops stationed in Europe.\n\nFrom a German perspective, and for German lawyers advising on US-European and US-German trade matters, the significance of this election is evident. In the first quarter of 2024, the U.S. became Germany\u00b4s largest trading partner, overtaking China, which has held this position for the past eight years.\n\nDo it Yourself Guide: The Keys to the White House\n\nThis article uses the \u201cKeys to the White House\u201d system developed by Allan Lichtman and Russian geophysicist Vladimir Keilis-Borok in 1981 as a \u201cdo-it-yourself guide\u201d to assess the status of the keys at the beginning of May 2024. This is not a final forecast, but a preliminary one. Allan Lichtman published a version himself in February of 2024 and has given several recent interviews with updates and his opinion on the Keys\u00b4 status as of early May 2024. This preliminary forecast is based on the premise, that the 2024 presidential election will be as fair and secure as the 2020 election, which was rightly called the safest presidential election in U.S. history. With the passage of the electoral Count Reform Act, and the virtual absence of voter fraud, the 2024 presidential election is expected to be free, fair, and as secure as possible.\n\nAllan Lichtman\u2019s Impeccable Track Record\n\nAllan Lichtman is the Nostradamus of election forecasters. He has made ten predictions for the U.S. presidential elections and all ten have been correct. He often makes his calls very early; for instance, he predicted the hard-to-call 2012 presidential election in July of 2010. He also accurately predicted the 2016 election for former President Trump in September 2016. The only controversy arose with the infamous 2000 election (the first divergence between the popular vote and the electoral college since 1888). Lichtman correctly predicted that Al Gore would win the popular vote, which he did by a margin of over 500,000 votes. However, the Supreme Court stopped the recount with Bush leading by 537 votes in Florida out of nearly 6 million votes cast in the state, in a highly controversial 5-4 decision along partisan lines. The will of the voters in Florida was clear, favoring Gore\u00b4s victory. One out of every nine votes cast by African-American voters, who overwhelmingly voted for the Democratic Party candidate, was discarded, compared to only one out of every fifty votes cast by white voters, wo are more evenly divided. As Lichtman correctly stated, \u201cGore should have won going away\u201d.\n\nWhat Are the Polls Saying Right Now?\n\nThe national polls and the average polls, especially in the seven swing states that will decide the election (Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina), all look unfavorable for Biden. However, at this early stage, they have zero value, particularly zero predictive value. Essentially, polls are worthless at this point and have often been significantly inaccurate before the 2012, 2016, 2020 and 2022 elections.\n\nWhat About Joe Biden\u00b4s Net Approval Rating?\n\nJoe Biden\u00b4s net approval rating is one of the lowest in modern U.S. history. Is his re-election bid doomed? Lichtman repeatedly emphasizes: \u201cThe U.S. presidential election is a vote up or down on the strengths and performance of the party holding the White House.\u201d There may be a small correlation between approval ratings and reelection chances just before an election, but in Lichtman\u00b4s system, a president\u00b4s approval rating is not a key. Therefore, we should not dwell on Biden\u00b4s ratings, which can, of course, change in any direction before the election.\n\nWhat About Polls and Punditry in General?\n\nAs Allen Lichtman always says: polls are snapshots. Keep your eye on the big picture, forget the polls, forget the pundits, forget the handlers, and the hucksters. Presidential elections are referenda on the strength and performance of the party holding the White House. The most important thing to do as a prognosticator is to keep your personal politics out of it. And one more thing: \u201cit is governing, not campaigning that counts\u201d.\n\nSo, let\u00b4s get to it.\n\nHow does the system work?\n\nThe system works as follows: \u201cThe Keys to the White House are stated as conditions that favor reelection of the incumbent party. When five or fewer statements are false, the incumbent party wins. When six or more are false, the incumbent party loses\u201d.\n\nWhere Do the 13 Keys to the White House Stand six Months before the U.S. Presidential Election?\n\nParty Mandate: False\n\n\u201cKey 1 Incumbent-party mandate: After the midterm elections, the incumbent party holds more seats in the U.S. House of Representatives than it did after the previous midterm elections.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic Party won fewer seats in the 2022 midterms (213 seats) than in the 2018 midterms (235 seats). This Key has turned irreversibly against Biden. However, Key 1 has the second lowest predictive value against the White House party (with only a 54 percent loss rate). Historically, it is perfectly normal for the party holding the White House to lose seats in the midterm elections.\n\nNo Primary Contest: True\n\n\u201cKey 2 Nomination contest: There is no serious contest for the incumbent-party nomination.\u201d\n\nBiden has not been seriously challenged for his party\u00b4s nomination. He will receive a large majority of the delegates at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. He has \u201clocked in\u201d this Key. This Key has the highest overall prediction rate.\n\nIncumbent Seeking Re-election: True\n\n\u201cKey 3: Incumbency: The incumbent-party candidate is the sitting president.\u201d\n\nBiden is running for re-election. The incumbency win rate is 74 percent.\n\nNo Third Party: Shaky but Leaning Towards Biden\n\n\u201cKey 4 Third party: There is no significant third-party or independent campaign.\u201d\n\nThe rule is that a significant third-party candidacy signals discontent with the party holding the White House. A candidate polling at ten percent or more (close to the election) might get more than 5 percent as an actual result. As of May 11th, independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy jr. is at 10.0 percent in the FiveThirtyEight polling average and at 10.8 percent in the RealClearPolitics polling average. Usually, third-party candidates poll much higher than the actual votes they end up getting. And it is questionable whether Kennedy Jr. will get on all the ballots, so he may just fizzle out as the election approaches. His own revelation, that a worm ate parts of his brain may not help his campaign. It could even lead to a split in the opposition party, as the Trump camp is already getting nervous about this prospect and is directing personal attacks against Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nThe last two times there was a significant third-party candidacy against a sitting president were in 1992 and 1996 (Ross Perot). Both the George H.W. Bush and Clinton administrations failed to achieve significant domestic policy success (Key 7, see below). Therefore, the current situation is not comparable to 1992 and 1996, considering that Bush Sr. even faced a (perceived) recession in the election year and lost Key 5. Another significant third-party candidacy occurred in the 1980 election against Democratic incumbent Jimmy Carter, with the candidacy of John Anderson. However, Carter was challenged by Ted Kennedy for the Democratic nomination (losing Key 2), had no domestic accomplishments, (losing Key 7), and faced an election-year recession (losing Key 5), making the 1980 situation also incomparable to Biden\u00b4s position in May 2024.\n\nThe only historical comparison might be 1948, but the third-party threat to Harry Truman came from two different factions of his own party. In modern history, 1948 is the only election where a sitting president ran without losing the party battle key, had a domestic accomplishment, no recession in the election year, and lost the third-party key. With the Democratic Party united behind President Biden, this also suggests that Kennedy\u00b4s candidacy is likely to fizzle out as we get closer to the 2024 election.\n\nStrong Short-term Economy: Tilt Toward Biden\n\n\u201cKey 5 Short-term economy: The economy is not in recession during the election campaign.\u201d\n\nThe economy is growing at a healthy rate, with unemployment below 4 percent for the longest time since the late 1960s and consumer confidence at 77 points in April, although it fell in May (in a preliminary version). Inflation has significantly decreased but remains stubbornly high above the Fed\u00b4s 2 percent target due to various factors. Normally an inverted yield curve would signal a recession. The current inverted yield curve is the longest in U.S. history. However, with Biden\u00b4s domestic accomplishments and large investments in infrastructure, chips and climate-friendly technology, the US economy continues to perform well, and a soft landing appears to be in sight. There is no prediction that the US will fall into a recession in the next 6 months. The OECD recently predicted a 2.6 percent GDP growth for the US economy in 2024.\n\nIf Keys 2 and 3 are both true, only Herbert Hoover in 1932, George H.W. Bush in 1992, and Donald Trump in 2020 lost their bids for reelection to the White House. What did they have in common? They all faced an actual or perceived recession in the election year (1932, 1992 and 2020, respectively). The win rate with Keys 2 and 3 being true is 18 out of 21. An even more important side note: When Keys 2, 3 and 5 are all true for the sitting U.S. president, the re-election rate is 100 percent. So if the economy avoids slipping into a (perceived) recession in the next few months, which is very likely, Biden will be in very good shape for his reelection campaign.\n\nStrong Long-term Economy: True\n\n\u201cKey 6 Long-term economy: Real annual per capita economic growth during the term equals or exceeds mean growth during the two previous terms.\u201d\n\nGrowth since Biden took office has been higher than the average of the last two administrations (2012-2020), especially since the economy tanked in 2020 during the last year of the Trump administration due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nMajor Policy Change: True\n\n\u201cKey 7 Policy change: The incumbent administration effects major changes in national policy.\u201d\n\nBiden may have the greatest domestic accomplishments since Lyndon B. Johnson\u00b4s Great Society, Voting Rights Act, Medicare and Medicaid. Biden successfully passed the American Rescue Plan in 2021 as a significant stimulus after the Covid-19 pandemic, a bipartisan infrastructure package, the CHIPS and Science Act to reduce dependence on Taiwanese chip production, and the Inflation reduction Act, the largest investment in transformative technology to combat climate change. Additionally, he capped health care costs and raised taxes on corporations and wealthy investors.\n\nNo Social unrest: A Little Wobbly but Still Leaning Toward Biden\n\n\u201cKey 8 Social unrest: There is no sustained social unrest during the term.\u201d\n\nThe first three years of the Biden administration have been remarkably calm with no significant social unrest. In April 2024, pro-Palestinian demonstrators at several universities in the United States threatened the stability of this Key. However the threshold for this key is quite high. Protests must be sustained and violent to challenge the social order. So far, it has not reached that level, and it is not even close; only a tiny fraction of U.S. universities have seen protests, and only a tiny fraction of the students at those universities have participated.\n\nFor historical comparison, the social unrest Key, with its high threshold of sustained national unrest and violence that threatens the social order, rarely turns against the White House party. In modern times, since World War II, the social unrest Key has only turned against the party holding the White House twice (1968 and 2020). Both times involved extraordinary circumstances in U.S. history.\n\nNo Scandal: True\n\n\u201cKey 9 Scandal: The incumbent administration is untainted by major scandal.\u201d\n\nThe Republican Party tried to impeach Biden over allegations that he used his office to enrich himself. However, this claim completely fell apart when the \u201cstar witness\u201c against Biden lied to the FBI and admitted to having ties to Russian intelligence. No scandal involving Biden is remotely on the horizon that would lead to impeachment and bipartisan recognition of a scandal.\n\nNo Foreign/Military Failure: Shaky but Leaning Toward Biden\n\n\u201cKey 10 Foreign or military failure: The incumbent administration suffers no major failure in foreign or military affairs.\u201d\n\nIt could be argued that the withdrawal of US soldiers from Afghanistan was a military failure. Thirteen U.S. soldiers and many more Afghan civilians died in a suicide attack. However, the departure date was set in advance by the Trump administration, withdrawals are always messy, and the majority of the U.S. public was happy with the U.S. military leaving Afghanistan. The press coverage was very critical of the Biden administration at the time. The threshold for a major military failure is also high. Biden\u00b4s net approval rating dropped by 10 percentage points during the withdrawal, but consumer confidence also dropped significantly during this period, so it is not clearly linked to the Afghanistan withdrawal. The withdrawal is not playing a major role in the campaign so far; even Trump only brings it up occasionally.\n\nSo far, the Russian aggression in Ukraine and the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7th, including the taking of hostages, are not considered military failures for Biden. The majority of U.S. Americans support Biden\u00b4s stance on Ukraine and Israel. Biden also appears to be trying to convince Netanjahu to limit military force in Rafah, as Democrats want him to be tougher on Israel. Since the United States Congress recently passed $95 billion in aid to Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan, it seems unlikely that the military situation in Ukraine, Israel, or the Pacific will turn into a military disaster that hurts Biden\u00b4s re-election bid.\n\nIn conclusion, there has been no major military failure for the Biden administration that would rise to the threshold (yet).\n\nMajor Foreign/Military Success: Leaning Against Biden\n\n\u201cKey 11 Foreign or military success: The incumbent administration achieves a major success in foreign or military affairs.\u201d\n\nJoe Biden has led an international coalition of nearly 50 nations to support Ukraine against Russia\u00b4s unprovoked and illegal war of aggression. In a major victory for the transatlantic alliance, Sweden, which has been neutral for more than 200 years, and Finland have joined the NATO.\n\nFor the most part, Ukraine has held the line against Russia\u00b4s invasion, achieving significant battlefield successes in 2022. Russia, the greatest geopolitical competitor of the U.S. for the last 79 years has lost 95 percent of its professional army and more than 50 percent of its armored stock. In this regard, Biden is successful because he took the lead in supporting Ukraine.\n\nHowever, at this point, the United States\u2019 support for Ukraine and Ukrainian battlefield victories do to not constitute a major military success for Biden because the war is still ongoing and there is no end in sight. Only a major advance by Ukrainian troops before the 2024 presidential election (which is highly unlikely) would be considered a foreign policy/military success for Biden.\n\nCharismatic Incumbent: False\n\n\u201cKey 12 Incumbent charisma: The incumbent-party candidate is charismatic or a national hero.\u201d\n\nBiden is a decent and empathetic man with an inspiring life story of grit, perseverance, and resilience against tremendous personal loss. However, he is not a great orator or exceptionally charismatic, and that will not change until the election. This Key has irreversibly turned false. But this is the key with the lowest loss rate, with only 46 percent loss probability.\n\nUncharismatic Challenger: True\n\n\u201cKey 13 Challenger charisma: The challenging-party candidate is not charismatic or a national hero.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump has a loyal following in his base. His base will not budge. However, he is charismatic only to his base and does not appeal to a broad swath of the electorate, unlike Barack Obama in 2008, Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984, or John F. Kennedy in 1960.\n\nWhat about Events Outside of the Keys?\n\nWhat about forces outside of the Keys: What about 91 felony indictments against Trump? What about the unprecedented nature of the campaign in modern times, with a rematch between a sitting president and a former president? What about AI? What about Russian and/or Chinese election interference?\n\nThe 13 Keys date back to the horse and buggy days of 1860 and form a very robust system. The unprecedented felony charges against Trump may hurt him (if he is convicted), but it is unclear how and when the further legal proceedings will take place and whether Trump will be convicted or acquitted. So, it is very unclear at this point how the charges will affect the election. We don\u00b4t know how successful Russian and Chinese election meddling will be or if it will have any significant impact at all. The same goes for AI and the unprecedented (in modern times) rematch of a sitting president against a former president. So, I fully stand by Lichtman\u00b4s 13 Keys to the White House.\n\nPreliminary Key Forecast, best guess: three Keys will be negative against Biden in the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election (Key 1, Key 11 and Key 12).\n\nIn terms of keys, the 2024 election could mirror the 1964 election with Lyndon B. Johnson, when Johnson lost Key 1, Key 11 and Key 12 or the 2012 election with Obama loosing Key 1, Key 6 and Key 12. Of course, this does not mean that the Electoral College (or popular vote) differential will be similar; it means that Biden will be re-elected President and Trump will lose fair and square.\n\nComparison with the 2012 Obama Presidential Re-Election Campaign\n\nThe most apt comparison would probably be the 2012 re-election of Barack Obama, a sitting Democratic president with a united party behind him and a domestic policy accomplishment (the Affordable Care Act, better known as \u201cObamacare\u201d). Obama lost the 2010 midterm elections (which he referred to as an election \u201cshellacking\u201d) and thus Key 1. Obama also lost the incumbent charisma Key, failing to maintain the magic of his 2008 campaign. So, Keys 1 and 12 are exactly the same in the 2012 and 2024 elections.\n\nObama lost Key 6 (long-term economic Key) during the Great Recession, with a loss prediction rate of 59 percent, and Biden (probably) will lose Key 11 (foreign/military success) a Key with a loss prediction rate of 61 percent. So in terms of the Keys, their win and loss rates, and the fact, that an incumbent Democratic president has been up for reelection in the modern era, the 2012 re-election probably comes closest. Back then, challenger Mitt Romney led in some of the polls for quite a while in the spring and summer of 2012, and the Democrats were in pretty much meltdown mode, just as they have been in late 2023. Obama went on to win the 2012 presidential election quite handily, with a 3.9 popular vote margin and, most importantly, a 332 to 206 Electoral College advantage.\n\nSide note: What About the GOP Electoral College Advantage?\n\nAs a side note, the GOP Electoral College \u201cadvantage\u201d may be shrinking so that even if Biden \u201conly\u201d wins the popular vote with 2,5-4 percent, he will eke out an Electoral College victory that puts him back in the White House. In 2020 Biden won the popular vote by just over 7 million votes (5 million in California and 2 million in New York). Nearly 160 million voters cast a ballot in the 2020 presidential election, but if Biden had lost a combined 43,000 votes in the three closest states, Georgia, Arizona, and Wisconsin, Trump would have been re-elected as president. This shows how large the Electoral College advantage for the GOP was in 2020, the largest since the 1948 presidential election.\n\nDecisive Electoral College States in 2024\n\nThe main campaign will take place in only seven states: the three Blue Wall states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin; Nevada; and the Sun Belt states of Arizona, Georgia (which Biden won in 2020), and North Carolina, which Obama won in 2008 and could be up for grabs for Biden in 2024.\n\nThe bottom line: Biden is in the Driver\u00b4s Seat\n\nIn conclusion, Allan Lichtman\u00b4s 13 Keys to the White House indicate that President Biden remains in the driver\u00b4s seat for his 2024 re-election bid and will very likely be inaugurated as the next President of the United States of America on January 20, 2025.\n\nRecommendation: Allan Lichtman\u00b4s Book and YouTube Channel\n\nFinally, I highly recommend Allan Lichtman\u00b4s book, \u201cPredicting the Next President: The Keys to the White House, 2024\u201d, which will be published on July 1, 2024. In his weekly live talks on YouTube, his son Sam interviews him, and viewers can ask questions. The discussions are very insightful, informative, entertaining, and funny, providing not only commentary on the 13 Keys, but also with a unique perspective on current and historical events in US (presidential) politics.\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nBj\u00f6rn-Michael Lange is a partner at Vy Rechtsanw\u00e4lte.

        "text": "A guilty verdict? Donald Trump and allies are bracing voters for the worst\nWASHINGTON - When former president and 2024 candidate Donald Trump claims that the judicial system wants to put him in jail, he's not just protesting the ongoing hush money trial.\n\nTrump is also bracing voters for the possibility of a guilty verdict.\n\nAt political rallies, on social media, and to reporters gathered at the courthouse in New York, Trump's attacks on the trial are designed in part to persuade voters to disregard a bad verdict, according to aides, legal analysts, and a review of his remarks.\n\n\"The New York judicial system has been absolutely abused,\" Trump told reporters Friday. \"The whole world is watching.\"\n\nTrump is accused of improperly influencing the 2016 presidential election by paying hush money to women, seeking to keep them from publicizing sexual liaisons. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nTrump targets moderate voters\n\nTrump has not explicitly said he expects a guilty verdict, and occasionally expresses public optimism about the outcome of the trial. \"Many good things are going on in the case,\" the former said Thursday.\n\nBut he has spent much more time claiming political bias by the judge, prosecutors and the jury pool, and argues without evidence that his political opponents will do anything to put him behind bars.\n\nTrump and supporters have also predicted that a guilty verdict would be reversed on appeal, a step that would not be necessary if he is acquitted or if there is a hung jury.\n\nLegal experts said Trump has little choice but to brace for a guilty verdict, given how it might affect his campaign against President Joe Biden.\n\nIn claiming the trial is unfair, Trump's targets include moderate and independent voters who have long been skeptical of his behavior.\n\n\"His base will believe everything he says,\" said Bradley P. Moss, a Washington, D.C., lawyer who specializes in government transparency issues. \"The question is independents.\"\n\nTrump appeals to New Jersey\n\nTrump's latest effort to brace supporters for bad legal news comes Saturday at a campaign rally in Wildwood, N.J.\n\nThis will be Trump's first campaign rally since a May 1 airport event in Freeland, Mich., where he went on at length about his legal concerns.\n\nWhile discussing the ongoing New York trial, Trump said \"we haven't had a decision here, but the decision here can probably only be one thing, I guess ... 'cause ... this whole thing - it's a rigged deal; it's a rigged deal.\"\n\nTrump also equated the hush money trial to the major civil cases he has lost, one over bank loan fraud and two others regarding defamation and sexual abuse of writer E. Jean Carroll.\n\nAltogether, civil courts have ordered Trump to pay more than $500 million in damages.\n\n\"Hopefully, we'll win all of that stuff easily on appeal,\" Trump said at one point in Michigan.\n\n'Orchestrating Trump's conviction'\n\nTrump is also trying to discount the New York verdict by citing legal analysts who agree with his criticisms of the case. Some of them say they believe Trump is bound for a guilty verdict because of the way the trial is being conducted by New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan.\n\nIn a Truth Social post on May 5, Trump cited comments by former federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy that described \"how Judge Merchan is orchestrating Trump's conviction.\"\n\nTrump also attacks the gag order against him, describing it as an attempt to fix the case. Merchan has found Trump in violation of the gag order ten items over attacks on witnesses and court personnel.\n\nIn reading out criticisms of the case on Friday, Trump said he has to be careful because of the gag order: \"If I mention the wrong word, they'll come out here and they'll take me out to jail some place, because that's the way it is with this judge - he wants to show how tough he is.\"\n\nRerun: Trump previously warned of indictments\n\nThe political world has seen this kind of courtroom drama previously, back before Trump was first indicted.\n\nIn late 2022 and early 2023, Trump braced supporters for the likelihood of indictments, and sought to taint them ahead of time by decrying the investigations as politically motivated.\n\nIn June of 2023, three months after the hush money indictment, Trump told a Republican group in New Hampshire that \"there could be others coming,\" and described them as \"election interference.\"\n\nTrump wound up under indictment in four separate criminal cases.\n\nIn addition to the New York hush money case, the former president faces trial in South Florida on charges of mishandling classified information, and two cases in Washington, D.C., and Georgia on federal and state charges respectively of trying to steal the 2020 election from Biden.\n\nTrump is seeking to delay the latter three trials to beyond Election Day on Nov. 5. He may succeed, leaving the New York case as his only trial during the election campaign.\n\nPolitically, the indictments may have helped Trump, at least with hardcore Republican voters who fueled his drive toward the 2024 presidential nomination.\n\nPolls and primaries also reflected skepticism of Trump from moderate and independent voters, some of whom continued to support former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley even after she dropped out of the race.\n\nPolitical impact\n\nIn the meantime, Trump is preparing for an actual verdict in the New York case - and a political impact that is unknowable.\n\nJonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University who is often cited by Trump, said the former president's complaints about a \"weaponized justice system\" are legitimate.\n\nEven if Trump is convicted, Turley said, he has a good chance to have the case reversed on appeal because \"the entire case is becoming a dumpster fire.\"\n\nTurley also said \"no one would bet on an acquittal from a New York jury on Trump,\" but it's possible that jurors will deadlock and be unable to render any verdict.\n\nTrump could legitimately celebrate a hung jury as a victory, he said.\n\nWhatever the merits of the case, Moss said Trump has been treated fairly by the justice system. For example, Moss said that any other defendant would be in jail now for violating gag orders the way Trump has. \"If anything,\" he said, \"he's been handled with kid gloves.\"\n\nMoss also said that, while Trump's base will stick with him no matter what, it's hard to see how a guilty verdict would help him.\n\n\"I don't see anything good coming out of this for Trump,\" Moss said. \"The question is how much damage it does.\"\n\nContributing: Bart Jansen",

Apart from these two candidates, several third-party hopefuls are also running for the coveted post in the US.\n\nCheck the list of candidates for US presidential Election:\n\nDonald Trump\n\nDonald Trump occupying the President\u2019s office from 2017-2021 has secured enough delegates to clinch the Republican nomination, setting up the first presidential rematch in nearly 70 years.\n\nDonald Trump has also leveraged his unprecedented legal challenges to solidify support among his base and has cast his third bid for the White House in part as retribution against perceived political enemies.\n\nTrump who is facing several court cases also faces 88 charges in four criminal cases over efforts to subvert the 2020 election, retaining classified documents after leaving office and alleged efforts to cover up a hush money payment to a porn star.\n\nJoe Biden\n\nPresent President of the US, Joe Biden launched his 2020 candidacy as an urgent bid to defend American liberties and protect democracy and has cast his re-election bid in the same light, saying Trump threatens the future of American democracy.\n\nInterestingly, Joe Biden faced no serious challenger for the party\u2019s nomination, which he clinched in March. The election in November will be much tougher, with the most recent Reuters/Ipsos poll putting Biden\u2019s voter support slightly ahead at 40% of registered voters, 1 percentage point ahead of Trump\u2019s 39%.\n\nMarianne Williamson\n\nMarianne Williamson, best-selling author and self-help guru, who is another US Presidential candidate, relaunched her long-shot 2024 presidential bid focusing on \u201cjustice and love\u201d less than one month after dropping out.\n\nShe said in February that she was getting back in to fight Trump\u2019s \u201cdark and authoritarian vision\u201d after earlier suspending it because she was losing \u201cthe horse race.\u201d\n\nRobert F Kennedy Jr\n\nEnvironmental advocate Robert F Kennedy Jr, who is also an anti-vaccine activist, is running for the US presidential election as an independent candidate after challenging Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination.\n\nEven as he lags in overall polling, Kennedy could siphon votes from Trump and Biden, with the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll showing he was backed by 8% of registered voters, a seven-percentage-point drop from March.\n\nCornel West\n\nA political activist, philosopher and academician, Cornel West is running for the US presidential elections. West is making a third-party bid for president that is most likely to appeal to progressive, Democratic-leaning voters.\n\nFor breaking news and live news updates, like us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

        "text": "Election 2024: Thurber ousts longtime state rep Haddad; voters mixed on ballot questions\n(This story was updated to add new information.)\n\nFALL RIVER \u2014 After a tumultuous campaign season, 2024 general election is over in Massachusetts, with results emerging about the region's and the state's future.\n\nBesides the U.S. presidential race, which saw former President Donald Trump re-elected over Vice President Kamala Harris, there are national and state candidates on the ballot, along with five state referendums.\n\nIncumbent state Rep. Pat Haddad, a Democrat, faced a rematch with Republican Justin Thurber for the 5th Bristol District seat. The two also campaigned against each other in 2022.\n\nThe race has been called for Thurber, 52% to 48%.\n\nTwo ballot questions pass, two fail\n\nAs of 7:30 a.m., the Associated Press has determined that Questions 1 and 2 have passed, with more than 88% of the vote counted.\n\nQuestion 1 allows the state auditor's office to audit the Legislature. It has passed with 71.5% in favor to 28.5% opposed.\n\nQuestion 2 removes the MCAS standardized test as a high school graduation requirement, with 58.9% of voters in favor and 41.1% opposed.\n\nQuestions 4 and 5 were defeated at the ballot box.\n\nQuestion 4 would have legalized certain natural psychedelic substances, including hallucinogenic mushrooms, for medical purposes. Voters rejected the measure 56.9% to 43.1%.\n\nQuestion 5 would have gradually raised the minimum wage for tipped workers to $15 per hour. Voters rejected it 63.9% to 36.1%.\n\nThe status of Question 3, which would allow Uber and Lyft drivers to form and join unions, has not yet been called.\n\nAll percentages are as of 7:30 a.m. Wednesday.\n\nResults unclear in 5th Bristol and 8th Bristol races\n\nAs of 7:15 a.m. Wednesday, the results of the 8th Bristol district race had not been called.\n\nThe race to replace retiring state Rep. Paul Schmid includes Democrat Steven J. Ouellette, Republican Christopher Thrasher, and Independents Laura A. Hadley, Manuel Soares Jr., and Jesse W. St. Gelais.\n\nAP: Sen. Warren wins re-election to Senate\n\nBased on exit polling, the Associated Press has called the Massachusetts Senate race for Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\n\nWarren was facing Republican attorney John Deaton.\n\nAP: Harris-Walz ticket wins in Massachusetts\n\nBased on exit polling, the Associated Press has called Massachusetts for Harris.\n\nGolf carts, rally for write-in at Bristol CC\n\nAt about 12:45 on Tuesday, foot traffic heading into the polling place at G Building at Bristol Community College\u2019s Fall River campus remained steady.\n\nGolf carts were available to bring voters to the polling station, for anyone who needs a lift.\n\nNadia Paquette, the warden for 9A, told The Herald News that vote counts as of 12:45 were: 436 votes cast in 9A, 353 votes cast in 9B, and 382 votes cast in 8C.\n\n\"It's been busy all day long,\" Paquette said, noting that before the polls even opened on Tuesday morning, there was already a line of voters outside, ready to cast their ballots.\n\nNearby to the golf cart pick-up, community members were holding signs for Sana Fadel, a write-in candidate for Congressional District 4.\n\nFall River resident Maryellen Kurkulos told The Herald News that the write-in campaign was put together by a diverse group of Massachusetts voters who are upset with Rep. Jake Auchincloss' take on the war in Gaza.\n\nKurkulos noted that MA-4 Voters for Peace, the group advocating for the write-in effort, is made up of members that are \"Christian, Jewish, Muslim, and agnostic.\"\n\nThe effort to have District 4 voters write-in Fadel is \"happening all over the district.\"\n\nKurkulos said that Fadel is a grassroots peace activist.\n\nA flyer that Kurkulos shared with The Herald News says, \"We [MA-4 Voters for Peace] unite around two values -- our desire to end our elected officials' enabling of an ongoing genocide, and our belief in a diplomatic resolution based on collective liberation and equality for all Palestinians and Israelis.\"\n\n\u2014 Kristina Fontes, The Herald News\n\nSteady flow for Election Day voting and treats\n\nAt noon on Tuesday at Fall River's Government Center, voting was also steady, with one poll worker saying in passing that there has been \"a lot of traffic today.\"\n\nVoters could cast their ballots and get a treat, as The Mastery School of Independent Learning was conducting a bake sale, with two students helping to run the table.\n\n\"There's been a steady flow of people in and out,\" the woman running the bake sale table, who preferred not to share her name, told The Herald News. \"Everyone's been super generous.\"\n\nOne of the students noted that an especially generous customer left them a $10 tip.\n\nFor those who need to drop off ballots at Government Center, the drop box is at the Third Street entrance.\n\n\u2014 Kristina Fontes, The Herald News\n\nPoll monitor in place at Somerset Berkley\n\nAt 11 a.m., the parking lot at Somerset Berkley Regional High School was bustling with voting traffic. Sign and flag holders for Democratic and Republican candidates were standing across from each other outside, but the atmosphere was civil, with passersby wishing each other a good morning as they passed.\n\nIt appeared as if many people came out to vote in groups, with couples and family groups going to cast their ballots together.\n\nAlthough it was crowded, the process was efficient, with voters moving in and out quickly.\n\nA poll worker who preferred not to share their name informed The Herald News that, as of 11 a.m., 1,935 ballots had been cast. That figure does not include mail-in ballots, they said. They also noted that overall turnout appeared to be more or less the same as turnout for previous elections.\n\nFor those who still have ballots to drop off, they can be returned to Somerset Town Hall. They are not being accepted on Election Day at Somerset Berkley Regional High School.\n\nErin Leary, a volunteer poll monitor and a civil rights attorney, was present to identify any prospective issues, such as accessibility issues, that would prevent anyone from voting. Leary also noted the high volume of voters present at the polls, and said that any potential issues may be reported to her.\n\n\u2014 Kristina Fontes, The Herald News\n\nSwansea voter: 'Democracy is on the line'\n\nAll Swansea precincts vote at Joseph Case High School, and at 11 a.m. parking lots at the rear of the building were full of cars coming and going. Police on hand guided a steady stream of voters into the school gymnasium, where rows of voting booths lined the floor, and back out a separate door \u2014 one-way traffic to accommodate the large turnout.\n\nHolding signs outside the polling place were sign-holders for Swansea Democratic Committee and supporters of Justin Thurber, the Republican candidate for 5th Bristol District.\n\n\u201cI feel democracy is on the line, and I really want Democrats to get in,\u201d said Nancy Martin-Bernier, a member of the Democratic Committee.\n\nBob Meehan was holding a sign for state Rep. Pat Haddad, who he said he\u2019s known since seventh grade. As for other races on the ballot, \u201cthe rest of it shall remain private.\u201d\n\nThurber\u2019s wife, Kerri, his mother, Lucy Farrar, and friend Angela Eddy held signs in support of him.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s sick of the division,\u201d Kerri Thurber said. \u201cHe just wants to make the 5th Bristol district better for everybody. Everything is really unaffordable, and people are struggling, and he wants to help them fix it.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Dan Medeiros, The Herald News\n\nFall River first-time voters 'coming out of the woodwork'\n\nThe crowds were thick at Fonseca Elementary School in Fall River, where precincts 5C and 8A vote.\n\nPoll workers were busy steering voters unaware of their precincts to the correct check-in tables, and passing out \u201cI voted\u201d stickers when finished \u2014 often passed down to children tagging along with parents.\n\nClerks helped voters whose ballots were spoiled and improperly completed to fill out new ones.\n\nPrecinct 5C warden Donald Hamilton said workers had to brief people on proper procedure because many were first-time voters.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people that haven\u2019t voted for a long time that are coming in, and we have to affirm their addresses,\u201d Hamilton said. \"But they\u2019re coming out of the woodwork, as they say.\u201d\n\nHe said he worked early voting at city hall for a few weeks, where many voters were first-timers.\n\n\u201cWe had a woman, if I remember it right, she was 67, and she was a first-time voter. And shortly after her, a couple days later, he was 72 \u2014 first-time voter.\u201d\n\nHis precinct had seen more action in the first two hours of polling than it had in the previous two years.\n\n\u201cWhen it\u2019s the presidential election, it\u2019s busier. And when there\u2019s any kind of controversy, it\u2019s busier,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this year we got both.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s bringing people out, and that\u2019s a great thing.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Dan Medeiros, The Herald News\n\nYoung and old \u2014 and future generations of voters \u2014 part of the process\n\nAt Precinct D in Westport, there were already 10 people voting inside as cars waited for parking spots to be available in the back area of Briggs Road Fire Station.\n\n\u201cEveryone should be voting. This is the big one,\u201d said David Costas, a Westport resident on his way in to vote.\n\nThe number of voters was 96 by 9 a.m.\n\n\"I think it's very important for people to come out...It's a duty to vote,\u201d added Mena Tenchara, who has served as warden for Precinct D for 64 years.\n\n\"I'm so happy that people are showing up to vote today. It's an honor and a privilege for us to be able to vote so freely in this country,\u201d said Eileen Moncrief, clerk for Precinct D.\n\n\"It's been great to see the number of children who have come with their parents to be part of it.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Seth Chitwood, The Standard-Times\n\n'It's been non-stop' at Westport poll site\n\nAt Westport's Our Lady of Grace Hall, the poll workers also reported a large number of people arriving to cast their vote since opening.\n\n\"We've never not had anybody in line since it opened at seven. It's been non-stop,\u201d said Maureen Murphy, warden for Precinct A at Our Lady Of Grace Hall. \u201cI think it's heartwarming to see people who are interested in taking charge of their own life.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope I voted for the right person,\u201d said Jessica Martin, while quickly walking out on her way to work.\n\n\u201cIf you haven\u2019t voted yet, get up and go vote now,\u201d added Gabrielle Santos-Rosa as she walked in to cast her vote.\n\n\u2014 Seth Chitwood, The Standard-Times\n\nVoting off to enthusiastic start in Westport\n\nSince opening the polls at 7 a.m. in the Westport area, poll workers reported that there has been a non-stop steady-stream of people arriving to cast their vote.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been very busy since we opened, which is very good,\u201d said Jean Maguire, clerk for Precinct B at Town Hall Annex in Westport, who said they had just hit over 100 votes at 8:30 a.m.\n\nPoll workers said they also observed a crowd of early voters throughout the week, but they expect it to be busier today.\n\n\u201cIt's so important, not just on a national level, but on a local level, and there are some local races here, and then, of course, the statewide ballot initiatives and of course, it's a presidential election. So it's key. It's so key,\u201d Maguire said.\n\n\u2014 Seth Chitwood, The Standard-Times\n\nVoters at one city precinct feeling blue\n\nA man walked out of Union United Methodist Church on Highland Avenue wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the face of former president Donald Trump on an old Western \u201cwanted\u201d sign, wearing a cowboy hat.\n\nMost other voters polled said they were supporting Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n\u201cWe just fear that Donald Trump will be president. We really fear it,\u201d said Norma Monteiro, voting with her husband James.\n\n\u201cWe feel as though we don\u2019t need a dictator,\u201d he said.\n\nA voter named Shay said voting was very important \u2014 \u201cmy rights,\u201d she said. \u201cMy voice.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile you have a voice, use it,\u201d said Donny, who was with her. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to take that away.\u201d\n\nFor Paul, the choice for the Harris-Walz ticket did not require decision-making.\n\n\u201cI lived in New York for 16 years,\u201d he said. \u201cI know who Donald Trump is.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to vote Democratic across the ticket,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not confused about what I\u2019m going to do. I didn\u2019t have to think about it. I didn\u2019t have to be swayed.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Dan Medeiros, The Herald News\n\n'It\u2019s been very busy' at Fall River polls\n\nAt busy precinct 7A in Fall River, 112 people had voted by 8:30 a.m. \u2014 a poll clerk said 115 people total had voted all day in the September primary.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been very busy,\u201d said warden Tracy Albernaz, saying that there\u2019d been a line out the door for the 7 a.m. opening of polls.\n\nClerks said the attitude of voters was tempered and dutiful.\n\nWhen voters entered into the Union United Methodist Church, they were greeted by a bake sale, which was doing a brisk business.\n\n\u201cWe took all the calories and whatnot out of them and blessed them,\u201d joked Cathy Morton, helping organize and lead the bake sale. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to gain any weight.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Dan Medeiros, The Herald News\n\nAllan Lichtman vs. Nate Silver:Who will accurately predict the 2024 election?\n\nElection 2024 live updates:Harris, Trump rally swing states with 2 days left; new polls\n\nWhat are the ballot questions?\n\nThere are five referendum questions on the ballot, asking voters to decide:\n\nif the state auditor has the power to audit the Legislature\n\nif Massachusetts should eliminate the MCAS high school graduation requirement\n\nif Uber, Lyft and other rideshare drivers can unionize\n\nif Massachusetts should legalize natural psychedelic drugs\n\nif Massachusetts should raise the tipped minimum wage\n\nHere\u2019s more info on each specific question.\n\nWho\u2019s running at the national level besides Harris and Trump?\n\nVoters in Westport and Dartmouth will also have a U.S. representative race on their ballot: incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep.

Kennedy Jr\u2019s health is in the spotlight again \u2013 this time relating to a neurological issue.\n\nIn a 2012 deposition recently reviewed by the New York Times, the politician revealed that in 2010 a worm got into his brain \u201cate a portion of it and then died.\u201d\n\nKennedy had been suffering from cognitive difficulties. Doctors initially suspected that he had a brain tumor, but it turned out to be a parasite infection \u2013 specifically, a pork tapeworm larva lodged in his brain.\n\nWATCH: Biden accepts endorsements from Kennedy family members at campaign event in Philadelphia\n\nThis particular parasite (Taenia solium) is mainly found in low-income countries where people live close to livestock, including parts of southern Africa, Latin America and Asia. Cases in the U.S. are reported to be in the hundreds per year. It is also an incredibly rare infection to encounter in Europe.\n\nHumans are the main host of mature tapeworms, but they need help from other intermediaries to spread. Once the tapeworm is attached to the human intestinal wall using the hooks and suckers on its head, it grows and matures by absorbing nutrients in the gut, forming hundreds of \u201cproglottids\u201d (segments) that are a few millimeters long. A tapeworm can grow to four meters in length.\n\nHermaphrodites\n\nA couple of months after infection, these proglottids become pregnant because tapeworms are hermaphrodites. Each proglottid contains 300 to 500 testes and three ovary lobes, and when released into the digestive tract contains between 50,000 and 60,000 fertile eggs. These will be excreted, where they can be observed as pumpkin seed-sized masses within the feces. This may be the only indication of active infection in humans.\n\nTapeworm larvae can survive outside of their human hosts. If pigs graze on vegetation that is contaminated with human feces containing the eggs or larvae (known as cysticerci), these are then taken up into the pig.\n\nOnce in the pig\u2019s stomach and intestines, the digestive enzymes release the cysticerci from their outer lining, enabling them to penetrate the pig\u2019s body tissues and move around where they will cause cysticercosis \u2013 the active infection.\n\nThey set up camp in all the major muscles of the pig, including the heart, as well as the liver, kidney, lungs and brain.\n\nOnce infected, the pigs are typically slaughtered before the cysticerci mature into adult tapeworms. So when the meat of an infected animal is eaten and not cooked properly, these cysticerci do the same to the human. They penetrate the intestinal wall and get into the bloodstream where they journey to reside and grow under the skin as a huge lump, in the eye, liver, heart and lungs and the brain.\n\nWATCH: Independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. picks Nicole Shanahan as his 2024 running mate\n\nInfection spreading through the body is known as cysticercosis. When the brain becomes infected, it is called neurocysticercosis.\n\nPork tapeworms don\u2019t eat brain tissue, but they do absorb its nutrients.\n\nA person with a tapeworm infection would initially have few or no symptoms. And any initial symptoms would mirror those of other common tummy bugs: nausea, pain, diarrhoea and changes in appetite.\n\nAt this stage, the condition is hard to diagnose. However, eggs may be seen in the faeces by eye or microscope, or the tapeworm may be observed when a camera is inserted into the bowel from the rectum for other procedures. Sometimes the eggs block the appendix, causing appendicitis.\n\nHowever, once the larvae reach the brain causing neurocysticercosis, several potentially serious, life-threatening symptoms may emerge. Larvae cause small cysts to form, which can be picked up on brain scans.\n\nIt is these cysts that cause symptoms, compressing neurons that can lead to defects in brain function, seizures and death.\n\nInfections are usually treated with antihelminthic drugs, such as niclosamide and praziquantel. Both have broad activity against various tapeworms. Anti-inflammatory drugs may also be used. Surgery is the last option when patients don\u2019t respond to any of the drugs.\n\nIt\u2019s all pretty grisly, so if you don\u2019t fancy a worm setting up camp in your brain, there are simple things you can do to avoid this situation, the most important being maintaining good hand hygiene. Wash your hands well after going to the toilet and after handling raw meat. And cook meat thoroughly.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation. Read the original article.\n\n",

        "text": "'Commentaries on Taylor Swift's influence are revealing of the polarization of American political life'\nMillions of albums sold. Fourteen Grammy awards. Time magazine's Person of the Year in 2023. A world tour in 20 countries. Fans referred to by her name: the \"Swifties.\" It's impossible to avoid Taylor Swift.\n\nAfter the staggering economic benefits of her concerts, her political role is driving conversations now. She could get her supporters to follow her if she were to reveal her vote in November's presidential election. The music star has yet to make a statement about this election, but she has already publicly endorsed the Democratic Party in 2018 and Joe Biden in the 2020 election. This position still seems paradoxical for an artist whose career began in country music.\n\nShe has become a pop star, after beginning to break away from the country world with her album Red in 2012 and leaving it with 1989, two years later. But she remains linked to the music genre. Her youth spent in Nashville, the Mecca of country music, and her trajectory all the way to New York have become the narrative thread of her national and global rise. If Swift's political positions are controversial, even to the point of being accused of treachery by the right, it is because her political silence until 2018 and her roots in country music seemed to invite the right to link her to the traditional conservatism of this musical genre.\n\nWhen it first flooded the United States music market in the 1920s, country music was immediately described as the music of the white, rural South. To this day, this has encouraged conservatives to use it to rally the white vote, as Alabama's segregationist governor George Wallace did in the 1960s and 1970s. This political exploitation of country music explains why artists and their audiences are often associated with conservatism and nationalism.\n\nWho listens to Taylor Swift?\n\nThis is why it seems contradictory for Swift to support Biden and speak out in defense of the rights of racial and sexual minorities and the protection of abortion rights. Yet country music is affected by the same currents that run through American society. While it has its share of conservative artists, musicians of the same generation as Swift take similar positions on women's and minority rights.\n\nSince the 1990s, when the country music industry began to target a more diverse, national audience, it has nonetheless been the habit of country musicians with large followings not to endorse either the Republican or Democratic parties. Superstars such as Dolly Parton, for example, take a stand against racism or homophobia, but don't take sides so as not to alienate a loyal part of their audience.\n\nYou have 58.16% of this article left to read.

Explaining the former president's favorite talking points\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jackie Lay/NPR Jackie Lay/NPR\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has a history of using provocative language to draw headlines, stir up support and attack enemies.\n\nHis words, at times, have been his greatest weapons but also his biggest vulnerability.\n\nIn recent weeks, he has described Nov. 5, Election Day, as \"liberation day\" for \"hardworking Americans\" and \"judgment day\" for his political enemies. He has called undocumented immigrants who commit crimes \"not people\" and has claimed Jews who vote for Democrats hate Israel.\n\nIt's not easy trying to make sense of what often appears to be indiscriminate attacks on migrants and political enemies, but Trump knows how to generate headlines, excite his base and provoke the left simultaneously.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHe has described political correctness as a cancer that prevents honest discussion. He says that people are too easily offended and that the country doesn't have time to worry so much about others' feelings.\n\nHis language is also a political weapon \u2014 and a very effective one \u2014 to use against his enemies. It's a tool that stokes his base and baits one of his favorite foils, the media.\n\nNPR examined Trump's campaign speeches, interviews and social media posts since he held his first rally last year in March, as well as additional relevant comments in recent years, to provide context to how his language reflects his political agenda. Here are a few of his most common talking points:\n\nThe U.S.-Mexico border\n\nNowhere has the former president pushed the boundaries of appropriate language more than on the issue of immigration and the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nHe has described migrants as poisoning the blood of the country and calling those who commit crimes \"animals.\"\n\nThis demonization of migrants is not new. It has been a pillar of his political career ever since he announced his presidential campaign in 2015 and called Mexican immigrants rapists, bringing drugs and crime, while also saying that some are \"good people.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe border has now become one of the fieriest political issues ahead of the November elections as both sides, Democrats and Republicans, have been pointing fingers at the other to cast blame for a myriad of problems.\n\nIt's a clear vulnerability for President Biden and the Democrats.\n\nBiden has struggled with historic numbers of people coming across the border. It's not just Republicans who are concerned. An increasing number of Democratic mayors and governors have raised real concerns about the drain of state and local resources in cities hundreds of miles from the border.\n\nIn a recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll, only 29% of respondents said they approve of how Biden is handling immigration. Republicans win the issue over Democrats by 12 percentage points when asked which party handles it better.\n\nCritics say Trump is capitalizing on those concerns by playing up anti-immigrant sentiments.\n\nWhile there is little evidence that undocumented immigrants commit more crimes than U.S.-born citizens, Trump and his supporters use anecdotal stories, such as the killing of 22-year-old nursing student Laken Riley, to paint an ominous picture about America being overrun by violent migrants.\n\nDuring speeches in Michigan and Wisconsin, Trump accused Biden of creating a \"border bloodbath.\"\n\n\"This is country-changing, it's country-threatening, and it's country-wrecking,\" Trump said in Michigan. \"They have wrecked our country.\"\n\nWhat Trump has said:\n\n\"They're poisoning the blood of our country. That's what they've done. They poison \u2014 mental institutions and prisons all over the world. Not just in South America. Not just the three or four countries that we think about. But all over the world they're coming into our country \u2014 from Africa, from Asia, all over the world. They're pouring into our country.\" \u2014Dec. 16, 2023, New Hampshire rally \"They're rough people, in many cases from jails, prisons, from mental institutions, insane asylums. You know, insane asylums \u2014 that's Silence of the Lambs stuff.\" \u2014March 4, 2024, interview with Right Side Broadcasting Network \"Hannibal Lecter, anybody know Hannibal Lecter? We don't want 'em in this country.\" \u2014March 4, 2024, interview with Right Side Broadcasting Network\n\nSponsor Message\n\nA second Trump term\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jeff Dean/AP Jeff Dean/AP\n\nTrump has been accused of using autocratic language in this campaign that echoes rhetoric of strongman leaders of the past.\n\nRather than rejecting those comparisons, Trump has been wielding them as a means to stoke his base, stir up media attention and, in some ways, win back former supporters.\n\nOne example is when he sparked the anger and indignation of his many critics after declaring he wouldn't be a dictator, \"except for Day 1,\" said Chris Stirewalt, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.\n\nHe says you could see a flash in Trump's eyes when Fox News host Sean Hannity provided Trump an opportunity to assure voters he wouldn't abuse his power.\n\n\"He realizes he's got a live one on the line, right?\" explained Stirewalt, who is also the political editor for NewsNation. \"He has the moment where he knows that the person who he's talking to wants him to say the right thing. And he knows that the advantage comes in saying the wrong thing.\"\n\nTrump responded \"only on Day 1,\" so that he could close the border and start drilling.\n\n\"After that, I'm not a dictator, OK?\" Trump quipped to Hannity as the crowd in Iowa applauded.\n\nThose fiery remarks set off a chain reaction of events and coverage. The media dissected the language, often repeating the dictator-for-a-day comments, and Trump's supporters came out in mass, largely on conservative outlets, attacking the media for, they argued, taking the comments out of context.\n\nStirewalt says Trump also triggered what he called \"the anti-anti-Trump immune response,\" which means Trump reengaged former supporters, who may have felt he went too far on Jan. 6, 2021, and/or objected to his authoritarian tendencies, to come to his defense.\n\n\"What you get is the volleying back and forth between platoons on the left and the right,\" Stirewalt said. \"Some of it's sincere \u2014 some of it's rage, content for clicks and attention. And by the time you're done, you have strength. Trump has managed to both inflame and distract his opponents, but also to further consolidate Republican support.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWhat Trump has said:\n\n\"This guy turned out to be a Woke train wreck who, if the Fake News reporting is correct, was actually dealing with China to give them a heads up on the thinking of the President of the United States. This is an act so egregious that, in times gone by, the punishment would have been DEATH!\" \u2014Sept. 22, 2023, Truth Social, referring to Gen. Mark Milley, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \"Your victory will be our ultimate vindication, your liberty will be our ultimate reward, and the unprecedented success of the United States of America will be my ultimate and absolute revenge.\" \u2014Feb. 24, 2024, Trump's speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference \"We're going to put a 100% tariff on every single car that comes across the line, and you're not going to be able to sell those guys if I get elected. Now, if I don't get elected, it's going to be a blood bath for the whole \u2014 that's gonna be the least of it. It's going to be a blood bath for the country. That'll be the least of it.\" \u2014March 16, 2024, Dayton, Ohio\n\nReshaping the federal government\n\nDuring a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Trump described himself as a \"proud political dissident\" and promised \"judgment day\" for political opponents.\n\nHe has vowed to \"root out\" political opponents whom he has described as \"vermin,\" echoing the language of authoritarian leaders who rose to power in Germany and Italy in the 1930s.\n\n\"The threat from outside forces is far less sinister, dangerous and grave than the threat from within,\" Trump said during a Veterans Day rally in New Hampshire.\n\nThe former president faces four different criminal trials related to allegations of interference in the 2020 election, fraud stemming from a hush money payment to an adult film star and mishandling of classified documents.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHe has repeatedly claimed the prosecutions are a political witch hunt, and he has cast himself as a martyr who is being targeted by Democrats.\n\nGeorge Lakoff, a professor emeritus of linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley, says Trump often uses salesman tricks to frame a debate on his own terms. He knows how to use repetition to strengthen association.\n\nHe repeats phrases over and over on the campaign trail and on social media, such as fake news or that he's going to obliterate \"the deep state.\" Those descriptions, right or wrong, are then repeated by others, such as the media in its coverage. They're repeated again as opponents attack him over the use of such words.\n\n\"There is a neural reason for this,\" Lakoff said. \"The main thing is, if it's in your brain and it's activating the neural system, whatever is activating your neural system, then your brain makes it stronger.\"\n\nTrump has sought to employ the prosecutions against him to justify his own calls to overhaul the \"deep state,\" including those longtime federal lawyers who make up the Justice Department, as well as other federal agencies that he argues are politically biased against him.\n\nHe and his allies have begun to draft plans to overhaul the Justice Department as well as expand his presidential powers by ending protections for tens of thousands of federal employees so that they can be replaced with partisan loyalists.\n\nWhat Trump has said:\n\n\"We pledge to you that we will root out the communists, Marxists, fascists and the radical-left thugs that live like vermin within the confines of our country, that lie and steal and cheat on elections.\" \u2014Nov. 11, 2023, New Hampshire \"The threat from outside forces is far less sinister, dangerous and grave than the threat from within. Our threat is from within.\" \u2014Nov. 11, 2023, New Hampshire \"In 2016, I declared I am your voice. Today, I add, I am your warrior. I am your justice. And for those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution.\" \u2014March 25, 2023, Waco, Texas \"Either the deep state destroys America, or we destroy the deep state.\" \u2014March 25, 2023, Waco, Texas\n\nSponsor Message\n\nForeign policy\n\nDuring a winter campaign rally, Trump said he told a NATO leader that he would encourage Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that were \"delinquent\" and had not paid bills they \"owed\" the NATO alliance.\n\nHis remarks set off a firestorm domestically and internationally, as Congress remains locked in a stalemate over whether to provide Ukraine with additional military assistance so that it can defend itself from the invasion by Russia.\n\nAs president, Trump sought to largely pull the United States out of foreign conflicts. But that hasn't stopped him from making bold claims about the current armed conflicts raging in Europe and the Middle East.\n\nHe has repeatedly insisted that those conflicts are related to Biden's election.\n\n\"Look what happened to our country,\" Trump said at a rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan. \"You have wars that never would have taken place. Russia would have never attacked Ukraine. Israel would have never been attacked. You wouldn't have had inflation.\"\n\nIf elected in November, Trump has vowed that both conflicts would be resolved fast. He has said he could end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours but has provided no details.\n\n\"There's a very easy negotiation to take place. But I don't want to tell you what it is because then I can't use that negotiation \u2014 it'll never work,\" Trump told Fox's Hannity last year. \"But it's a very easy negotiation to take place. I will have it solved within one day, a peace between them.\"\n\nStirewalt says the secret to Trump talking about foreign policy is making it sound so easy and simple \u2014 even the most incredibly complex problems of the day \u2014 and people believe him.\n\n\"The authoritarian tendency in politics, not just in the United States but anywhere, is to say that there is a simple and easy answer,\" Stirewalt said. \"But the bad people will not let you obtain it because they're weak \u2014 or they're corrupt.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has pressured lawmakers on Capitol Hill to oppose billions of dollars in additional aid for Ukraine. He has also seemed to go out of his way to avoid criticizing Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nTrump's approach to the war in Gaza has been a little more nuanced.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP\n\nWhile they worked closely together during his administration, Trump was angry when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated Biden after winning the 2020 presidential election.\n\nHe at first criticized Netanyahu for being unprepared for the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas that killed 1,200 people, and he complimented the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah when it stepped up attacks against Israel.\n\nWhile he has since pledged strong support for Israel, Trump has also called on Netanyahu to end the war and has warned that Israel was losing the PR war.\n\n\"What I said very plainly is get it over with, and let's get back to peace and stop killing people,\" Trump told The Hugh Hewitt Show. \"And that's a very simple statement. Get it over with. They've got to finish what they finish. They have to get it done. Get it over with, and get it over with fast, because we have to, you have to get back to normalcy and peace.\"\n\nWhat Trump has said:\n\nTime magazine: You think you could work better with [Israeli politician] Benny Gantz than [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu in a second term? Trump: I think Benny Gantz is good, but I'm not prepared to say that. I haven't spoken to him about it. But you have some very good people that I've gotten to know in Israel that could do a good job. Time: Do you think \u2014 Trump: And I will say this: Bibi Netanyahu rightfully has been criticized for what took place on October 7. \u2014Interview with Time magazine, published April 30, 2024 \"You didn't pay? You're delinquent? No, I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want. You gotta pay. You gotta pay your bills.\" \u2014Feb. 10, 2024, rally in Conway, South Carolina \"You know, Hezbollah is very smart. They're all very smart.\" \u2014Oct. 11, 2023, speech in West Palm Beach, Florida \"Any Jewish person that votes for Democrats hates their religion. They hate everything about Israel, and they should be ashamed of themselves.\" \u2014interview with former Trump administration senior adviser Sebastian Gorka on March 18, 2023\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAbortion\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jose Luis Magana/AP Jose Luis Magana/AP\n\nTrump's abortion stances are all about politics. He has repeatedly changed his positions over the years \u2014 in 2016, he told MSNBC's Chris Matthews during a town hall that if abortion were outlawed, \"there has to be some form of punishment\" for women seeking abortions. He later retracted that statement.\n\nAs president, he supported a 20-week federal abortion ban, pushing the Senate to pass it. He also repeatedly took credit for the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade. But by the time of the 2024 presidential campaign \u2014 when Roe was overturned, meaning a federal ban would be possible \u2014 his position on a federal ban was unclear.\n\nNotably, he went the entire Republican primary without clarifying his stance on abortion, instead saying he would bring together both sides \u2014 abortion-rights supporters and abortion-rights opponents \u2014 and negotiate a compromise policy.\n\nWhen he has spoken about abortion policy during this year's campaign, he has often stressed one point in particular: that he wants to win.\n\nHe said exactly that again when he made an abortion policy announcement on April 8. In that announcement, he said that he wants states to make their own policies and that he supports exceptions to protect a mother's life, as well as for pregnancies caused by incest or rape. He later added, \"But we must win. We have to win.\"\n\nTrump is attempting to walk a careful line on abortion. On the one hand, he wants to maintain the favor of the abortion-rights opponents who have long been the Republican base. But on the other hand, he understands that most Americans are not abortion hard-liners and that tight restrictions have proved unpopular in several statewide elections.\n\nIn addition, he has not taken a position on sweeping abortion restrictions proposed in Project 2025 \u2014 a road map for a conservative presidency written by a coalition of right-wing groups. Those restrictions include curtailing access to abortion pills, as well as using the Comstock Act \u2014 a 19th-century law intended to stop indecency \u2014 to prohibit the mailing of any goods used in abortions.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWhat Trump has said:\n\nTime magazine: Are you comfortable if states decide to punish women who access abortions after the procedure is banned? Trump: Are you talking about number of weeks? Time: Yeah. Let's say there's a 15-week ban \u2014 Trump: Again, that's going to be \u2014 I don't have to be comfortable or uncomfortable. The states are going to make that decision. The states are going to have to be comfortable or uncomfortable, not me. \u2014Interview with Time magazine, published April 30, 2024 \"The states will determine [their abortion policies] by vote or legislation or perhaps both, and whatever they decide must be the law of the land \u2014 in this case, the law of the state. Many states will be different. Many will have a different number of weeks, or some will have more conservative than others. ... Always go by your heart. But we must win. We have to win.\" \u2014April 8, 2024, Truth Social \"The number of weeks, now, people are agreeing on 15, and I'm thinking in terms of that, and it'll come out to something that's very reasonable. But people are really, even hard-liners, are agreeing, seems to be 15 weeks, seems to be a number that people are agreeing at. But I'll make that announcement at the appropriate time.\" \u2014Sid & Friends in the Morning, WABC, March 19, 2024 Trump: People are starting to think of 15 weeks. That seems to be a number that people are talking about right now. Kristen Welker: Would you sign that? Trump: I would sit down with both sides and negotiate something, and we'll end up with peace on that issue for the first time in 52 years. I'm not going to say I would or I wouldn't. Trump: Both sides will come together. And for the first time in 52 years, you'll have an issue that we can put behind us at the federal level. It could be state or it could be federal. I don't frankly care. \u2014Meet the Press, NBC, Sept. 16, 2023 \"I support the three exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. And I think it's very hard politically if you don't support, but you have to go with your heart. You have to go with what you believe, and you have to rely on your heart for that.\" \u2014speech to the Concerned Women for America, Sept. 15, 2023 \"After 50 years of failure, with nobody coming even close, I was able to kill Roe v. Wade, much to the 'shock' of everyone.\" \u2014May 17, 2023, Truth Social \"It wasn't my fault that the Republicans didn't live up to expectations in the MidTerms. ... It was the 'abortion issue,' poorly handled by many Republicans, especially those that firmly insisted on No Exceptions, even in the case of Rape, Incest, or Life of the Mother, that lost large numbers of Voters.\" \u2014Jan. 1, 2023, Truth Social \"I call upon the Senate to pass this important law and send it to my desk for signing,\" referring to the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would have banned abortions nationwide after 20 weeks of gestation. \u2014Jan. 19, 2018, March for Life \"The answer is, there has to be some form of punishment.\" \u2014March 30, 2016, MSNBC town hall\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWhat Trump hasn't said:\n\nTrump refused to answer whether a fetus has constitutional rights in that September 2023 Meet the Press interview. In addition, Trump has not weighed in on the main abortion proposals included in Project 2025. One proposal calls on the Food and Drug Administration to roll back rules making abortion pills more available or to even rescind approval of the pills altogether. The other proposal calls for invoking the Comstock Act, an anti-indecency law, to halt the mailing or transporting of any goods used in providing abortions. That move would greatly restrict abortions, even in states where abortion is legal. NPR asked Trump's campaign what his position is on the Comstock Act. The campaign wouldn't answer directly.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Charlie Neibergall/AP Charlie Neibergall/AP\n\nTrade and tariffs\n\nTrump is unfailingly strident in how he talks about trade, proposing policies that are deeply protectionist. His communication about that protectionism is central to his political persona \u2014 he uses trade as a way to telegraph that he is business savvy, not to mention that he is tough and wants the U.S. to not get \"ripped off.\"\n\nThis involves suggesting tariff levels that are unheard of in modern U.S. trade policy. During this election cycle, Trump has reportedly discussed tariffs of 60% and, in one speech, of 100%.\n\nThere is also a full Trump presidential term of trade policy to observe. As president, Trump started a trade war with China. He also imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum, with the rationale that those tariffs were in the interest of national security because they increased U.S. self-reliance for defense supplies. The right-leaning Tax Foundation estimates that while Trump's tariffs did create revenue, they will also cost nearly 170,000 jobs in the long run. Its research also found that the Biden administration kept many of Trump's tariffs in place.\n\nIn his discussions of trade throughout his political career, however, Trump has at times exhibited indifference to, or even a lack of understanding of, how trade works. For example, he has talked about trade deficits as if they are indications that a country is losing money. He also has cast bilateral trade deals as superior to multilateral deals. Most trade experts disagree with that take. Furthermore, while he casts tariffs as beneficial for Americans, tariffs also often end up raising prices for American consumers. Finally, he often talks about trade deals as policies with winners and losers, when the goal of trade deals is to allow all parties to benefit.\n\nIt is also worth noting that while Trump's trade policy is aimed at protecting American industry, it is also deeply concerned with domestic politics \u2014 it's a way to court votes, particularly in industrial states.\n\nWhat Trump has said:\n\n\"I think when companies come in and they dump their products in the United States, they should pay automatically. Let's say a 10% tax. That money would be used to pay off debt.\" \u2014Interview on Fox Business, Aug. 18, 2023 \"It is the policy of my Administration to represent the American people and their financial well-being in all negot[i]ations, particularly the American worker, and to create fair and economically beneficial trade deals that serve their interests. Additionally, in order to ensure these outcomes, it is the intention of my Administration to deal directly with individual countries on a one-on-one (or bilateral) basis in negotiating future trade deals.\" \u2014Presidential Memorandum Regarding Withdrawal of the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership Negotiations and Agreement, Jan. 23, 2017 \"Trade wars are good, and easy to win.\" \u2014Twitter, March 2, 2018 \"This is not merely an economic disaster, but it's a security disaster. We want to build our ships, we want to build our planes, we want to build our military equipment with steel, with aluminum from our country. And now we're finally taking action to correct this long-overdue problem.\" \u2014speech at White House, March 8, 2018 \"Every time I see a weak politician asking to stop Trade talks or the use of Tariffs to counter unfair Tariffs, I wonder, what can they be thinking? Are we just going to continue and let our farmers and country get ripped off? Lost $817 Billion on Trade last year. No weakness!\" \u2014Twitter, July 25, 2018\n\nTrans issues\n\nTransgender issues weren't a major national issue in 2016 they way they are now. Similarly, Trump in 2016 was neither as vocal about nor as stridently opposed to transgender rights. When the topic did come up in a 2016 Today show segment, he said he wanted people to use whatever bathrooms they wanted.\n\nBut as president, Trump took several actions to curb transgender rights \u2014 excluding transgender individuals from the military, allowing health care professionals to discriminate against them and allowing homeless shelters to exclude them.\n\nAnd as transgender issues have become central to political culture wars \u2014 and as anti-transgender activists have increasingly focused their attention on transgender kids \u2014 Trump has become increasingly vocal about the topic as well. He refers to gender-affirming care for minors as \"mutilation\" and regularly says in his stump speech that transgender girls shouldn't play girls' sports \u2014 one of his most reliable applause lines.\n\nOften, he wraps transgender issues in with school vaccine and mask mandates, as well as the teaching of what opponents call \"critical race theory,\" as a way of packaging these social issues as educational policy.\n\nWhat Trump has said:",

        "text": "Lithuania holds presidential election amid concerns over Russia-Ukraine war\nPolls have closed in Lithuania\u2019s presidential election, held at a critical time for the strategically important Baltic country during Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.\n\nPolls closed at 8pm (17:00 GMT) on Sunday, and the initial voter turnout was 59.4 percent, higher than in the previous election in 2019, the Central Electoral Commission said.\n\nResults are expected early on Monday.\n\nWith eight candidates running, it is unlikely that one of them would win the 50 percent of the votes needed to win in the first round. If no one clears this hurdle, a run-off will be held on May 26.\n\nThe popular incumbent, Gitanas Nauseda, is a moderate conservative, and one of his main challengers is Ingrida Simonyte, the current prime minister and former finance minister, whom he beat in a run-off in 2019 with 66 percent of the votes.\n\nAnother contender is Ignas Vegele, a populist lawyer who gained notoriety during the COVID-19 pandemic for opposing restrictions and vaccines.\n\nThe top three contenders agree on defence but have different views on social issues and on Lithuania\u2019s relationship with China, which has been strained for years over Taiwan.\n\nAldona Majauskiene, 82, told the Agence France-Presse news agency she voted for Nauseda because \u201che is the best in every category.\u201d\n\nCivil servant Airine, 53, told the agency she voted for Simonyte and hopes for less populism from the future president.\n\n\u201cI am not voting for faces. I am voting for those who really can help boost our security and quality of living,\u201d she said.\n\nConcerns over Russia\n\nThe president in Lithuania oversees foreign and security policy and acts as the supreme commander of the armed forces.\n\nThe country is located on NATO\u2019s eastern flank, which is particularly relevant as tensions rise between Russia and the West over Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, which is now more than two years long.\n\nThe Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, also on the Baltic Sea, lies between Lithuania to its north and east and Poland to its south. There is great concern in Lithuania, therefore, and in neighbouring Latvia and Estonia over Russia\u2019s latest gains in northeastern Ukraine.\n\nAll three Baltic states declared independence after the collapse of the Soviet Union and joined both the European Union and NATO.\n\nLithuania, home to 2.8 million people, fears it could be next in Russia\u2019s crosshairs if Moscow wins its war against Ukraine. It is a top donor to Ukraine and a big defence spender with a military budget equal to 2.75 percent of its gross domestic product.\n\nAlso on the election ballot is a referendum that asks whether the constitution should be amended to allow dual citizenship for hundreds of thousands of Lithuanians living abroad as the country struggles with a decreasing population.\n\nFor the first time, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) turned down an invitation by Lithuania to observe the election.\n\nThe Lithuanian government wanted to exclude monitors from Russia and Belarus, accusing the OSCE members of being threats to its political and electoral processes.\n\nThe organisation said Lithuania was breaking the rules of the OSCE and the observers do not represent their countries\u2019 governments, having signed a code of conduct pledging political neutrality.",

That attention is just one sign that his candidacy could have a real impact on this year's election.\n\nIt's still early, but when pollsters include Kennedy in presidential surveys, he consistently earns around 10% of the vote. While those may not be winning numbers, they certainly can impact the outcome of the election that is likely to be won on the margins.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nYou're reading the Consider This newsletter, which unpacks one major news story each day.

Do they have it or not? But he has one of the the most important names of a political dynasty in this country, along with the Adamses and the Roosevelts and the Bushes. And for some, it's still a golden name,\" Perry said.\n\nAnd while the Kennedy dynasty has been more associated with progressive politics, Kennedy's affiliation with vaccine conspiracies has widened his appeal to a broader audience, and alienated him from some of his inherited base.\n\nBernard Tamas is an expert on U.S. third parties. He says that RFK Jr.'s support is driven by general dissatisfaction with the status quo, and the weight of his name.\n\n\"But he's taking the anti-vaxxer position, which doesn't really work for progressives. He's avoiding the Gaza issue, and has been very pro-Israel. It's unlikely that support there is going to sustain itself. But again, and I really want to emphasize this, there is no way to know at this point [which candidate] he's going to harm more.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe third party effect\n\nThroughout his campaign, Kennedy hasn't given clear answers on many of his stances. Tamas says that approach is unusual, even for a third party candidate.\n\n\"I mean, the successful ones have used a strategy referred to as 'sting like a bee.' The idea is you tap into that anger with some forms of galvanizing issues, something that really energized them. And you use that to distinguish yourself from the major parties and to attack them and cause them pain,\" Tamas said.\n\nThat pain would lead to pressure for the major parties to co-opt the issues that the third party candidate is presenting, he explained.\n\n\"And so once like the bee, they sting, they have a tendency then to die. But the goal of actually influencing policy in America is achieved. And this we've seen repeatedly in American history.\"\n\nWhen it comes to RFK Jr., Tamas says there doesn't seem to be a cohesive strategy surrounding the issues he discusses on the campaign trail.\n\n\"We're seeing a group of issues that don't necessarily seem to be tapping into any particular group and almost seem self-contradictory. I mean, he is very much anti-science when it comes to vaccines, but very much pro-science when it comes to climate change. And this is going to, I suspect, going to be a real problem as he moves forward.\"\n\nHow does RFK's popularity in November impact the odds for Biden and Trump?

        "summary": " Donald Trump has been pushing fears over record levels of migration hard in Wisconsin . Republican politicians have turned Whitewater into the poster child for anti-migrant rhetoric . Two-thirds of Wisconsin voters agree that 'the Biden administration\u2019s border policies have created a crisis of uncontrolled illegal migration into the country\u2019",
        "text": "Migrants, real and imagined, grip US voters, 1,500 miles north of border\nRhinelander is closer to the Arctic Circle than to Mexico, so it is no great surprise that few people in the small Wisconsin city have laid eyes on the foreign migrants Donald Trump claims are \u201cinvading\u201d the country from across the US border 1,500 miles to the south.\n\nBut Jim Schuh, the manager of a local bakery, is nonetheless sure they are a major problem and he\u2019s voting accordingly.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see immigrants here but I have relatives all over the country and they see them,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s Biden. He\u2019s responsible.\u201d\n\nLarge numbers of voters in key swing states agree with Schuh, even in places where migrants are hard to find as they eye cities such as Chicago and New York struggling to cope with tens of thousands of refugees and other arrivals transported there by the governors of Texas and Florida.\n\nTrump has been pushing fears over record levels of migration hard in Wisconsin where the past two presidential elections have been decided by a margin of less than 1% of the vote. A Marquette law school poll last month found that two-thirds of Wisconsin voters agree that \u201cthe Biden administration\u2019s border policies have created a crisis of uncontrolled illegal migration into the country\u201d.\n\nTrump has twice held rallies in Wisconsin over the past month at which migrants have been a primary target. In Green Bay he called the issue \u201cbigger than a war\u201d and invoked the situation in Whitewater, a small city of about 15,000 residents in the south of the state.\n\nRepublican politicians have turned Whitewater into the poster child for anti-migrant rhetoric in Wisconsin after the city\u2019s police chief, Dan Meyer, appealed for federal assistance to cope with the arrival of nearly 1,000 people from Nicaragua and Venezuela over the past two years.\n\nMeyer made clear in a letter to President Joe Biden in December that he was not hostile to the foreign arrivals as he expressed concern about the \u201cterrible living conditions\u201d endured by some.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a family living in a 10ft x 10ft shed in minus 10 degree temperatures,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBut the police chief said that his department was struggling to cope with the number of Spanish-speaking migrants because of the cost of translation software and the time taken dealing with a sharp increase in unlicensed drivers. Meyer also said that his officers had responded to serious incidents linked to the arrivals including the death of an infant, sexual assaults and a kidnapping.\n\nHowever, he told Biden that \u201cnone of this information is shared as a means of denigrating or vilifying this group of people \u2026 In fact, we see a great value in the increasing diversity that this group brings to our community.\u201d\n\nThat did not stop Republican politicians from descending on Whitewater to whip up fear.\n\nThe Wisconsin senator Ron Johnson, a close ally of Trump who has spoken at the former president\u2019s political rallies, and a Republican member of Congress from the state, Bryan Steil, held a meeting in the city to denounce what they described as the \u201cdevastating\u201d consequences of the migrant arrivals.\n\nJohnson blamed \u201cthe whole issue of the flood of illegal immigrants that have come to this country under the Biden administration\u201d.\n\nSteil declined to back Meyer\u2019s appeal for federal financial assistance and said the answer lay in legislation to secure the border. However, the congressman was among those Republicans who killed off a bipartisan border security law after Trump opposed the legislation in an apparent move to keep the crisis a live political issue going into the presidential election.\n\nView image in fullscreen President Joe Biden waves to supporters after delivering remarks during a visit to Gateway Technical College in Sturtevant, Wisconsin, on Wednesday. Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters\n\nRepublican members of the Wisconsin legislature wrote to Biden in January demanding action over what they claimed was a surge in violent crime in Whitewater even though Meyer has said he sees no threat to residents from the migrants and that \u201cwe are a safe community\u201d.\n\nSome Whitewater residents are furious at the political intervention. Brienne Brown, a member of the city council for six years, said residents had been welcoming of the migrants, with community organisations providing food, furniture and bedding to many.\n\n\u201cThe spotlight fell on us because Ron Johnson and Bryan Steil decided to make it a political event for themselves. Most people here were incredibly angry. They feel like they\u2019ve been used as a political football,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe crime that is occurring is super low level, which is mostly our police department pulling over somebody in a car who doesn\u2019t have a licence.\u201d\n\nThe police chief has called for migrants to be allowed to obtain driving licences but the Wisconsin legislature will not allow it.\n\nBrown said that the serious incidents of assault involved domestic violence as well as the case of a woman who abandoned her newborn baby in a field, and that those kind of crimes remained uncommon.\n\nWisconsin has long relied on migrant workers, many of them undocumented, as farm labour. Studies have suggested that the state\u2019s dairy farms would grind to a halt without foreign workers. Historically, most were from Mexico. Whitewater tended to attract people from Guanajuato as migrants from the Mexican state sent word back about job opportunities.\n\nBrown noticed a change during the Covid crisis.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d knock on doors a lot just to talk to my constituents right around the pandemic. I started noticing that a lot of them were not from Mexico. They were from Nicaragua and Venezuela,\u201d she said.\n\nBrown said the workers moved into accommodation left by students forced to return home by the pandemic lockdown.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of farms, a lot of chicken farms, a lot of egg farms. There are factories that make spices, there are factories that can food. They\u2019re always looking for low-paid workers and they never have enough. So there was plenty of work available,\u201d she said.\n\nSchuh, like many other Americans critical of what they describe as Biden\u2019s open border policy, makes a point of distinguishing between those who go through the formal process of immigration with a visa and those walking across the border to seek asylum or work illegally.\n\n\u201cI have nothing against immigrants but it has to be done the right way,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump continued to stoke the issue at a rally in Michigan earlier this month when he blamed Biden for the murder of Ruby Garcia in March. The former president claimed his administration had deported the man who has confessed to the shooting, Brandon Ortiz-Vite, and that \u201ccrooked Joe Biden took him back and let him back in and let him stay in and he viciously killed Ruby\u201d. Ortiz-Vite was deported in 2020 following his arrest for drinking and driving. It is not clear when he returned to the US.\n\nTrump told the rally that he spoke to Garcia\u2019s family and that they were \u201cgrieving for this incredible young woman\u201d. But Garcia\u2019s sister, Mavi, denied that anyone in the family spoke to the former president and accused him of exploiting the murder for political ends.\n\n\u201cHe did not speak with any of us, so it was kind of shocking seeing that he had said that he had spoke with us, and misinforming people on live TV,\u201d she told WOOD-TV.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always been about illegal immigrants. Nobody really speaks about when Americans do heinous crimes, and it\u2019s kind of shocking why he would just bring up illegals. What about Americans who do heinous crimes like that?\u201d",

        "text": "Brain worm bugs Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s campaign\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr at a press conference in New York, May 1, 2024. EDUARDO MUNOZ / REUTERS\n\nWho can benefit from the candidacy of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the third man in the American presidential election to be held in November? With six months to go, the question remains unanswered but the independent candidate continues to be the focus of many attacks. Many on the right and left are trying to dissuade him from continuing, especially since his campaign is riddled with controversy.\n\nAn environmental lawyer and champion of the anti-vax movement, Kennedy is struggling not to undermine his own cause. On a number of subjects, his positions are nebulous and sometimes contradictory. In an email to supporters, he described the January 6, 2021 rioters at Washington's Capitol as \"activists\" who had been \"deprived of their constitutional freedoms.\" No sooner had his team called the initiative \"a mistake\" than he did it again on Thursday, May 9, on MSNBC. All the demonstrators on Capitol Hill were \"unarmed,\" he argued. And he does not rule out pardoning some of those convicted if elected.\n\nThe nephew of former president John F. Kennedy surprised even his running mate, former Democrat billionaire Nicole Shanahan, on abortion. He argued on Thursday that abortion should be legal until the end of pregnancy. Astonished, the vice presidential candidate cited a \"communication problem.\" At the start of his campaign in August 2023, \"RFK\" had come out in favor of an opposing position, namely a federal ban on abortion after three months.\n\nSince the New York Times' May 8 revelations about his health, 70-year-old Kennedy has been the target of half-horrified, half-commiserating reactions. According to the newspaper, which quotes the candidate's own words in a court deposition, a worm has eaten away part of his brain, causing significant after-effects, including cognitive problems. The deposition, dated 2012, took place in the context of his divorce from his second wife. Kennedy pleaded that his income had dropped significantly as a result of his health problem. In particular, he claimed to be affected by \"long- and short-term memory loss.\"\n\nA 'problem solved over 10 years ago'\n\nInterviewed by the newspaper, the candidate explained that surgeons had initially thought it was a brain tumor before discovering that the parasite had died and there was no need to operate. Later, his memory problems were attributed to mercury poisoning, which, according to the candidate, was the result of a diet rich in fish.\n\nYou have 64.51% of this article left to read.

        "text": "Donald Trump brings presidential campaign to Wildwood, NJ\nMost voters told Action News that border security and the economy are their biggest concerns this election cycle.\n\nWILDWOOD, New Jersey -- Wildwood became a hot spot on Saturday as local officials said nearly 100,000 people packed the beach to get a glimpse of former President Donald Trump.\n\nMany attended his rally to hear what he has to say as he juggles his presidential campaign and his ongoing hush money criminal trial in New York City.\n\nThis event marked Trump's first campaign event in Wildwood since he ran for re-election in 2020.\n\nAt the rally, he addressed everything from President Joe Biden's handling of the border, protests on college campuses, and the economy.\n\n\"Instead of a Biden tax hike, I'll give you a Trump middle class, upper class, lower class, business class big tax cut. You're going to have the biggest tax cut,\" Trump stated.\n\nThe gates opened at noon Saturday ahead of the rally on the beach.\n\nAnticipation for the rally was high, as Trump's supporters set up shop on the streets of Wildwood, some even camping out overnight on the boardwalk.\n\nSome people started lining up on the boardwalk Wednesday night.\n\n\"This is my 52nd rally. So we go to a lot of them. We're part of the front row Joe's,\" said Sharon Anderson of Etowah, Tennessee at the front of the line.\n\nLisa Fagan, spokesperson for the city of Wildwood, told The Associated Press that she estimated a crowd of between 80,000 and 100,000 attendees, based off her own observations on the scene Saturday, having seen \"dozens\" of other events in the same space.\n\nTrump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, drew what his team called a \"mega crowd\" to a Saturday evening rally in the southern New Jersey resort town 150 miles (241 kilometers) south of the New York City courthouse where he has been forced to spend most weekdays sitting silently through his felony hush money trial.\n\nThe former president is alleged to have tried to conceal payments he made to an adult film star to keep an intimate encounter between the two of them a secret ahead of the 2016 election that ended with Trump in the White House.\n\nTrump has called the trial a witch hunt and, without any evidence, has accused President Joe Biden of using the criminal justice system to attack him for political gain ahead of their presumptive rematch in November.\n\n\"They rigged the whole thing with the Department of Justice,\"Trump told the crowd during the rally.\"I'vebeen indicted more than the great Alphonse Capone.\"\n\nMany of Trump's supporters say they liked what they heard on Saturday. They also shrugged off the idea of Trump going to prison, instead focusing on other issues, such as the economy.\n\n\"We need to have some stability. We need our interest rates back down. We need our pensions and 401Ks and everything to be where they were,\" said Anne Marie Corbett from Denville.\n\n\"It's worse all the way around. Underneath Trump, we were able to take vacations, start a business. I was just an average go-to-work-everyday person and it's been hard since Biden's been in,\" added Nick Carangi from Millville.\n\nOthers said the border remains their primary concern.\n\n\"We don't know who's being let in our country now. We don't know if these people are terrorists. We don't know\" said Sue Vessette from Winsted, Connecticut.\n\nMost voters who spoke with Action News on Friday say border security and the economy are their biggest concerns this election cycle.\n\nMayor Ernie Troiano, a Republican, says this rally is a boom for the shore.\n\n\"Any time that you can have a president or a candidate for president come to your community, it's a win-win. It's an economic feast for the businesses,\" said Troiano.\n\nTalia Cohen, manager of One Stop Shop, said the extra business during what is typically a slow period goes a long way for the family-owned shop.\n\nOn Saturday, she had Trump merch flying off the shelves.\n\n\"It's significant, it's way bigger than what we get in the summer of big weekends, which says a lot,\" Cohen said.\n\nMeanwhile, Biden opened his weekend on the West Coast, where he hosted a fundraiser and blasted Trump on issues such as women's reproductive rights.\n\nAnd in terms of jobs, the Biden Campaign pointed out that Trump left office with the worst job record since the Great Depression.\n\n----------\n\n* Get Eyewitness News Delivered\n\n* More New Jersey news\n\n* Send us a news tip\n\n* Download the abc7NY app for breaking news alerts\n\n* Follow us on YouTube\n\n\n\nSubmit a tip or story idea to Eyewitness News\n\nHave a breaking news tip or an idea for a story we should cover?

        "text": "A Donald Trump-Marco Rubio ticket? Here are the obstacles\nCould former President Donald Trump choose Florida Sen. Marco Rubio as his 2024 running mate? Rubio\u2019s getting a lot of attention, along with other possible vice presidential picks.\n\n\n\nSelecting Rubio would require some constitutional two-stepping.\n\nArticle II, Section I of the U.S. Constitution says that, when the Electoral College meets to determine the president, \"the electors shall meet in their respective states, and vote by ballot for two persons, of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves.\"\n\nWatch NBC6 free wherever you are WATCH HERE WATCH HERE\n\nThis clause has generally been interpreted to mean that if the presidential and vice presidential candidate come from the same state, the electors from that state cannot vote for both. They could vote for the president, but not for the vice president.\n\nCurrently, both Trump and Rubio are Floridians. In 2019, Trump famously renounced his longtime New York residency in favor of residing at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida. And Rubio is serving his third term representing the Sunshine State.\n\nGet local news you need to know to start your day with NBC 6's News Headlines newsletter. SIGN UP SIGN UP\n\nBecause Florida has 30 electoral votes, and because the election is expected to be close, a Trump-Rubio ticket would be riskier than a ticket with a non-Floridian.\n\nWhat are those risks? Here are some questions and answers. (Rubio sidestepped the issue during a May 5 appearance on \"Fox News Sunday\"; his office did not answer an inquiry for this article.)\n\nWhat happens if Trump chooses Rubio and both keep their Florida residency?\n\nIf Rubio doesn\u2019t change his residency, Florida electors could not vote for both men. Assuming the electors all vote for Trump and not Rubio, and assuming Trump doesn\u2019t win the presidency with at least 285 electoral votes, this would temporarily leave the vice presidency in limbo.\n\nIf no Trump-backing elector in Florida would choose the Democratic vice presidential nominee (presumably incumbent Vice President Kamala Harris), then no vice presidential candidate would receive an electoral college majority.\n\nThat kicks the decision to the Senate, which can choose from the top two finishers; whoever got Florida\u2019s electoral votes for vice president would finish no higher than third and would be ineligible.\n\nToday, the Democrats hold a narrow edge in the Senate. However, the Senate that would choose the vice president prior to the Jan. 20, 2025, inauguration would include the new members elected in 2024. Because the Democrats face headwinds in keeping their majority, a Republican-majority Senate could end up deciding.\n\nHowever, the choice wouldn\u2019t be a slam dunk, Arizona State University political scientist Steve Smith said.\n\nDeciding the issue, known as a point of order, can be debated \u2014 \"and it can be filibustered,\" Smith said. So, even if the GOP has enough votes to reach a simple majority, it would still need additional Democratic votes to surpass the 60-vote supermajority hurdle to cut off debate, he said.\n\nThe Senate could use a simple majority \u2014 rather than the usual 60-vote supermajority \u2014 to waive the need for a supermajority. This process, known as the \"nuclear option,\" has been used before to allow for simple majority votes for nominations, including for the U.S. Supreme Court in 2017. But in a chamber as tradition-bound as the Senate, the nuclear option has been controversial and is never taken lightly.\n\nCould Rubio resign from the Senate and move to another state?\n\nThis would be the cleanest way to resolve this vice presidential quandary. In 2000, Dick Cheney quit his Texas residency to run from Wyoming, which he had represented in the U.S. House, because his ticket mate, George W. Bush, was from Texas.\n\nTo do this, Rubio would also have to cede the Senate seat he would otherwise be entitled to hold until January 2029. And the Democrats would have a slightly larger margin in the Senate until the end of this year \u2014 all on the chance that Trump wins the presidency.\n\nReporting by veteran Florida political journalist Marc Caputo found state election law experts conflicted about what would happen to Rubio\u2019s seat if he resigns.\n\nThe normal deadline for federal candidates to declare to run for a vacated Rubio Senate seat has already passed. Although the state\u2019s primary is Aug. 20, ballots must be sent to overseas absentee voters, including service members, beginning July 6. And to meet this deadline, election officials would need sufficient lead time to design and print the ballots. \"Anything after June 21 becomes burdensome for us,\" Christina White, supervisor of elections in Miami-Dade County, told Caputo.\n\nSo, the window for initiating a 2024 election to succeed Rubio is fast closing.\n\nAnd if it\u2019s too late for the 2024 election, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis \u2014 who challenged Trump in the presidential primary \u2014 might be able to choose a temporary replacement, likely to serve through January 2027.\n\nCan Rubio relinquish his Florida residency?\n\nIf Rubio decided to move out of state, he\u2019d first have to extricate himself from his Florida residency. This seems doable, experts say, though it\u2019s odd; politicians usually want to establish, not cede, residency.\n\nUnder Florida law, residency rules vary depending on the purpose, such as qualifying for in-state tuition or a homestead tax exemption. Aubrey Jewett, a University of Central Florida political scientist, said residency questions arise frequently for lower-level offices.\n\nJennifer S. Blohm, an election lawyer in Florida with the firm Meyer, Blohm and Powell, P.A., said that to determine residency status, courts usually consider driver\u2019s license registration, voting registration and whether the person has a habitable home in the jurisdiction.\n\nBlohm said Rubio could probably maintain a house in Florida that he considers a vacation home while taking up residence in a new state.\n\nWhether Rubio can establish a residency in another state may be trickier, University of Virginia law professor John Harrison said.\n\nHarrison said residency requirements vary by state but often involve the legal concept of \"domicile.\" This is established by people\u2019s physical presence in a jurisdiction, combined with their intent to reside in that jurisdiction indefinitely and not elsewhere.\n\nIn Rubio\u2019s case, \"even if he were to buy a house somewhere else, he might not have the requisite intent\" under that particular state\u2019s law to become a resident, Harrison said. \"Cheney could plausibly say that he had established domicile in Wyoming because he moved there from Texas and had the requisite intent to live in Wyoming indefinitely\" based on his previous congressional service.\n\nBut Rubio \"doesn\u2019t have a connection with any state other than Florida that would suggest that he could have an intent to remain in that other state indefinitely.\" States often also mandate minimum periods people should be in the state to qualify.\n\nLet\u2019s say Rubio manages to establish residency outside of Florida. Could he still represent Florida in the Senate?\n\nThis should be straightforward, experts say.\n\nThe Constitution requires a senator to be an inhabitant of the state \"when elected,\" and that was certainly true in 2022, when Rubio won his current term.\n\nAlso, when the Supreme Court in 1995 struck down state laws establishing term limits for U.S. House members, its ruling said a state \"can\u2019t add to the qualifications for federal office\" that already exist in federal law, Harrison said.\n\nSo, Florida can\u2019t pass a law to force its senators to live in Florida.\n\nCould Rubio remain in Florida to see if Trump wins, then change residency before the Electoral College votes?\n\nA close reading of the Constitution makes this theoretically possible. The clause that penalizes a presidential and vice presidential candidate who come from the same state refers to ballot casting by electors, not the general public. So, Rubio might be able to reduce his downside risk by residing in Florida until the election is called, then shift his residency if Trump wins, as long as it\u2019s before electors cast their ballots Dec. 17.\n\nBesides being logistically challenging for Rubio and his family, this residency switching could inspire litigation.\n\n\"There is still an argument made about the purpose, or spirit, of the constitutional provision in play, which in this case is plainly to keep two people from the same state serving as president and vice-president during the same term,\" University of North Carolina law professor Michael Gerhardt said.\n\nGerhardt added that Congress has sometimes found its way around plain constitutional language by, for instance, making an exception for elected members who fall short of the constitutional age requirement.\n\n\"It is not unthinkable that Congress or the Court could devise an exception for this along the same lines,\" he said.\n\nWhy is all the burden on Rubio? Couldn\u2019t Trump do something?\n\nTrump could fairly easily move his residency to one of his other properties. New York seems unlikely, since his earlier move to Florida offended New Yorkers and because he\u2019s faced both civil and criminal prosecution there. But he owns the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey.\n\nPerhaps Trump could even just stay in one of his hotels. When he was running for president in 1988, George H.W. Bush called a suite at the Houstonian hotel his residence.\n\n\"One part of me thinks given all of these complications, Trump might not choose Rubio,\" Jewett said. \"But on the other hand, time after time for eight years now, Trump has done novel things that often cause big legal messes. So that has not often stopped him before.\"",

        "text": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. walks back support for 'full-term' abortions following pressure from campaign\nIndependent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has changed his stance on abortion once again, saying he supports abortion up until a certain point rather than at full term.\n\nFollowing pressure from campaign staff, Kennedy announced late Friday that he was walking back his stance of supporting \u201cfull-term abortions\u201d in a statement released on X. \u201cAbortion has been a notoriously divisive issue in America, but actually I see an emerging consensus \u2014 abortion should be legal up until a certain number of weeks, and restricted thereafter,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOnce the baby is viable outside the womb, it should have rights and it deserves society\u2019s protection,\u201d he added.\n\nKennedy\u2019s latest shake-up on where he stands on the divisive issue came after he said last week that he would allow women to have abortions at full term.\n\nDuring an interview with podcaster Sage Steele, a former ESPN host, Kennedy was asked what the limit should be for women to have an abortion. \u201cShould there be a limit or are you saying all the way up to full term, a woman has a right to have an abortion?\u201d Steele asked.\n\nKennedy answered that he didn\u2019t think anyone would want to do that at eight months of pregnancy, but abortion should be out of the hands of the government and in the hands of women.\n\n\u201cEven if it\u2019s full-term,\u201d Kennedy said in response to a follow-up question. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever OK,\u201d he added. When Steele said that would allow late-term abortions, Kennedy said, \u201cI think we have to leave it to the women rather than the state.\u201d\n\nThe answer left his running mate Nicole Shanahan surprised during her sit-down interview with Steele, released a week prior.\n\n\u201cMy understanding with Bobby\u2019s position is that, you know, every abortion is a tragedy, is a loss of life,\u201d Shanahan said. \u201cMy understanding is that he absolutely believes in limits on abortion, and we\u2019ve talked about this. I do not think, I don\u2019t know where that came from.\u201d\n\nShanahan went on to say, \u201cThat is not my understanding of his position and I think maybe there was a miscommunication there.\u201d\n\nKennedy\u2019s latest clarification comes after the candidate previously said he would support a much more strict stance on abortion.\n\nDuring an interview with NBC News in August of last year, Kennedy said if elected, he\u2019d support signing a national abortion ban after the first three months of pregnancy, before his campaign walked back the comments.\n\nKennedy told NBC News, \u201cI believe a decision to abort a child should be up to the women during the first three months of life.\u201d Pressed on whether that meant signing a federal ban at 15 or 21 weeks, he said yes.\n\nKennedy\u2019s campaign later put out a statement saying that the candidate \u201cmisunderstood\u201d repeated questions on the topic.\n\n\u201cMr. Kennedy misunderstood a question posed to him by an NBC reporter in a crowded, noisy exhibit hall at the Iowa State Fair,\u201d a spokesperson said, clarifying the candidate\u2019s stance on abortion as \u201calways\u201d being the woman\u2019s right to choose. Kennedy \u201cdoes not support legislation banning abortion,\u201d the campaign added at the time.\n\nKennedy and Shanahan are set to speak at a campaign rally in Austin, Texas, on Monday. This is the first time the pair will appear together in person since Kennedy announced Shanahan would be joining his campaign as his vice presidential selection.",

        "text": "Thought Given to Election Portends High Turnout in U.S.\nWASHINGTON, D.C. -- Seventy-one percent of Americans say they have given \u201cquite a lot\u201d of thought to the upcoming presidential election, which is on par with election year readings at similar points in the 2008 and 2020 campaigns but higher than in 2000, 2004 and 2012.\n\nThis suggests voter turnout could be robust this year, as Gallup research has shown that, historically, the amount of thought given to an election tends to correspond with turnout. Voter turnout in the 2008 and 2020 elections -- when thought given to the election at this stage mirrored today\u2019s -- was the highest since 1968.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nGallup has tracked the amount of thought Americans have given to presidential elections at various points during every cycle since 1952. The latest data are from an April 1-22 poll, conducted several weeks after Donald Trump won enough delegates to clinch the Republican nomination.\n\nThe data from previous presidential election years used for comparison are from polls conducted within two months after the candidates involved in competitive nomination battles -- one (in incumbent years) or both (in non-incumbent years) -- won the requisite number of delegates to secure the nomination. Such data is not available for 2016.\n\nEach year, U.S. adults have given at least slightly more thought to the election as it drew closer.\n\nAttention Among Democrats and Republicans Particularly High This Year\n\nAmericans who identify with either of the major political parties are highly engaged this year, with 84% of Democrats and 78% of Republicans saying they have given the presidential election a lot of thought. The six-percentage-point gap between Democrats and Republicans is not statistically significant. As is typically the case, political independents are less likely to be thinking about the election, at 61%.\n\nThe current reading is the highest for Democrats at this point in the campaign over the same period. Similarly, Republicans\u2019 level of thought matches the group\u2019s 2020 high point. Each group\u2019s lowest reading at this point in the campaign was in 2000 when George W. Bush and Al Gore were running.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nGallup data from 2023 show that more Americans identify as political independents than as Republicans or Democrats, and more independents lean toward the Republican than Democratic Party. As a result, the party gap in thought given to the election narrows to four points when partisan-leaning independents are added to the party subgroups -- 76% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents versus 72% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents report giving it a lot of thought.\n\nAttention to the election varies among and between other demographic groups. While men and women are about equally likely to say they have given this year\u2019s election a lot of thought, older adults, White adults, college graduates and those with higher annual household incomes are more engaged than their counterparts. Political liberals and conservatives are also more likely than moderates to say they are highly engaged. These groups reporting that they have given a lot of thought to the election are also those who have been more likely to cast a ballot for president.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nBottom Line\n\nA broad majority of Americans say they are thinking a lot about this year\u2019s election. The current level of attention is identical to a similar point in the 2020 election when the same two candidates squared off against each other. Engagement is now on the high end of similarly timed readings since 2000 and would be expected, based on historical patterns, to increase as the election gets closer. High voter attention has typically led to elevated voter turnout, but it remains to be seen whether voters will ultimately be as motivated to vote this year as they were in 2020, when more voters cast ballots than in any other election in the 21st century. Another wild card this year is the 29% of Americans who say neither candidate would make a good president and might therefore be less motivated to vote.\n\nTo stay up to date with the latest Gallup News insights and updates, follow us on X.\n\nLearn more about how the Gallup Poll Social Series works.\n\nView complete question responses and trends (PDF download).\n\n###Embeddable###",

        "text": "Donald Trump leads Joe Biden in five key battleground states, new polls show\nDonald Trump leads Joe Biden in five crucial battleground states less than six months out from election day, new polls showed.\n\nThe surveys from the New York Times, the Philadelphia Inquirer and Siena College put the former president up in Pennsylvania (three points), Arizona (seven), Michigan (seven), Georgia (10) and Nevada (12). Biden led by two points in Wisconsin.\n\nAll leads bar Trump\u2019s in Georgia and Nevada were within the margin of error.\n\nAs the poll resonated throughout the political scene, the Biden campaign issued a statement from Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster.\n\n\u201cThe only consistency in recent public polls is inconsistency,\u201d Garin said.\n\n\u201cThese results need to be weighed against the 30-plus polls that show Biden up and gaining \u2013 which is exactly why drawing broad conclusions about the race based on results from one poll is a mistake.\u201d\n\nTrump is currently on trial in New York City, on 34 criminal charges arising from hush-money payments to an adult film star who claimed an affair.\n\nThat is effectively an election interference trial. The former president also faces four federal charges and 10 state charges, in Georgia, for attempted election subversion and 40 federal charges concerning his retention of classified information.\n\nTrump\u2019s attempt to overturn Biden\u2019s conclusive win in 2020 culminated in the deadly attack on Congress on 6 January 2021, by a mob he told to \u201cfight like hell\u201d in his cause.\n\nNine deaths have been linked to the riot including law enforcement suicides and more than 1,200 people have been arrested, hundreds convicted and jailed, some for seditious conspiracy.\n\nAnd yet, amid much electorate concern that at 81 Biden is too old for a second term \u2013 though Trump is just four years younger \u2013 the Times said \u201ca yearning for change and discontent over the economy and the war in Gaza among young, Black and Hispanic voters threaten to unravel the president\u2019s Democratic coalition\u201d.\n\nThe polls showed 20% support for Trump among Black voters, which if it held in the election would be the highest level of such support for a Republican candidate since the civil rights era.\n\nThere was better news for Biden in results culled from people who described themselves as likely to vote, with the current president leading in Michigan and narrowly behind in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Victories in those three states in November would probably be enough to keep Biden in the White House.\n\nRobert F Kennedy Jr, the third-party candidate seeking ballot access in all 50 states even while having said he once had a worm in his brain linked to cognitive problems, scored about 10% in the polls, drawing equally from both Trump and Biden.\n\n\u201cThe findings are mostly unchanged since the last series of Times/Siena polls in battleground states in November,\u201d the Times said, listing factors that might be seen likely to aid Biden: the stock market gaining 25%, Trump\u2019s criminal trials beginning and Biden\u2019s campaign spending heavily in battleground states.\n\nBut voters who spoke to the paper cited cost-of-living concerns and dissatisfaction with the social and political status quo as reasons to abandon Biden for Trump.\n\nRemarkably, the paper reported that \u201cnearly 70% of voters say that the country\u2019s political and economic systems need major changes \u2013 or even to be torn down entirely\u201d.\n\nAbortion rights also looms as a key campaign issue.\n\nTrump has boasted of his role in appointing three rightwingers to the US supreme court, resulting in the removal of federal abortion rights in 2022 with the overturning of Roe v Wade, the ruling that guaranteed them.\n\nDemocrats have focused on the issue, taking a string of wins when abortion rights have been on the ballot, even in Republican-run states.\n\nIn the new polls, a familiar majority (64%) said abortion should be always or mostly legal (a stance shared by 44% of Trump voters). The polls also showed voters prefer Biden to handle abortion rights issues by 11 points.\n\nBut nearly 20% of respondents blamed Biden more than Trump for the fall of Roe.\n\nGarin said: \u201cThe reality is that many voters are not paying close attention to the election and have not started making up their minds \u2013 a dynamic also reflected in today\u2019s poll. These voters will decide this election and only the Biden campaign is doing the work to win them over.\u201d",

        "text": "The effects of Facebook and Instagram on the 2020 election: A deactivation experiment\nSignificance We provide the largest-scale evidence available to date on the effect of Facebook and Instagram access on political knowledge, attitudes, and behavior in a presidential election season. This study is part of the U.S. 2020 Facebook and Instagram Election Study, a unique collaboration between academics and researchers at Meta that allowed unprecedented access to Meta platform data and algorithms while also including extensive safeguards to guarantee the integrity of the research. Keywords: social media, Facebook, Instagram, election, polarization\n\nAbstract We study the effect of Facebook and Instagram access on political beliefs, attitudes, and behavior by randomizing a subset of 19,857 Facebook users and 15,585 Instagram users to deactivate their accounts for 6 wk before the 2020 U.S. election. We report four key findings. First, both Facebook and Instagram deactivation reduced an index of political participation (driven mainly by reduced participation online). Second, Facebook deactivation had no significant effect on an index of knowledge, but secondary analyses suggest that it reduced knowledge of general news while possibly also decreasing belief in misinformation circulating online. Third, Facebook deactivation may have reduced self-reported net votes for Trump, though this effect does not meet our preregistered significance threshold. Finally, the effects of both Facebook and Instagram deactivation on affective and issue polarization, perceived legitimacy of the election, candidate favorability, and voter turnout were all precisely estimated and close to zero.\n\nMany people argue that social media has profoundly affected democracy in America. Social media may increase political polarization, in part by facilitating ideological echo chambers among like-minded people (1\u20136). It may make voters more (5, 7\u20139) or less (10\u201313) knowledgeable, depending on the balance of accurate and inaccurate information that they receive. It may either increase (4, 14, 15) or decrease (16, 17) political engagement and voter turnout, and it may impact overall trust and confidence in the electoral system (18, 19). Observers on each side of the political spectrum speculate that social media may tilt elections in favor of their opponents (20\u201323). Much of this discussion has focused on Facebook, but Instagram is now a more widely used platform among younger voters and contains a significant amount of political content (24, 25).\n\nThese concerns were particularly relevant in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Affective polarization among U.S. voters reached an all-time high in 2020 (26). Popular media articles argued that misinformation on social media was a key driver of the 2016 election outcome (20, 21, 27), and several observers speculated that its impact in 2020 could be as large or larger (28\u201330). Concerns about the integrity of the electoral process were widely aired on social media, including concerns about fraud and vote-by-mail (31), and social media played an important role in the events following the election, including the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d movement questioning the election outcome and the storming of the U.S. Capitol on January 6 (32, 33). Some have highlighted ways that social media may have advantaged Joe Biden (34, 35); others have emphasized ways it benefited Donald Trump (36).\n\nWe use a randomized experiment to measure the effects of access to Facebook and Instagram on individual-level political outcomes during the 2020 election. We recruited 19,857 Facebook users and 15,585 Instagram users who used the platform for more than 15 min per day at baseline. We randomly assigned 27% to a treatment group that was paid to deactivate their Facebook or Instagram accounts for the 6 wk before election day, and the remainder to a control group that was paid to deactivate for just 1 wk. We estimate effects of deactivation on consumption of other apps and news sources, factual knowledge, political polarization, perceived legitimacy of the election, political participation, and candidate preferences.\n\nExisting experimental evidence on the effects of social media access is limited. Most related are earlier experiments that measured the effect of Facebook deactivation on political outcomes in the United States (5, 37) and other countries (38, 39). Our paper differs from this prior literature in studying social media access in a U.S. presidential election and in evaluating the effects of both Facebook and Instagram. Our Facebook sample alone is more than 10 times larger than any previous deactivation experiment of which we are aware. Our study also improves on earlier experiments by incorporating directly measured outcomes and administrative platform data from Meta, including a wider range of survey-based outcomes, and using a longer deactivation period. Our study builds on a broader literature using randomized experiments (40\u201342) and observational \u201cnatural experiments\u201d (4, 43\u201348) to study political effects of social media.\n\nOur study has several important limitations, related to generalizability, a time-limited intervention, general equilibrium effects, self-reported outcomes, and attrition. We discuss these in more detail below. While all of these limitations are common in experimental studies of social media, they suggest caution in interpreting our results.\n\nThis project is part of the U.S. 2020 Facebook and Instagram Election Study (49\u201352). Although both Meta researchers and academics were part of the research team, the lead academic authors had the final say on the analysis plan, collaborated with Meta researchers on the code implementing the analysis plan, and had control rights over data analysis decisions and the manuscript text. Under the terms of the collaboration, Meta could not block any results from being published. The academics were not financially compensated and the analysis plan was preregistered prior to data availability. More details of this partnership are in SI Appendix, sections F and G. We have posted answers to frequently asked questions online at https://medium.com/@2020_election_research_project/us-2020-facebook-instagram-election-study-frequently-asked-questions-faq-266d30cbe95b.\n\nTheoretical Mechanisms Prior research suggests mechanisms by which social media access could affect each of our primary outcomes. Social media access may affect political knowledge by increasing exposure to both true and false content. Many Americans regularly get news through social media (53), and the great majority of political content on social media is from major news outlets (54). However, misinformation often spreads through social media (55), and a small share of users see significant amounts of false content (54, 56, 57). Social media access may affect polarization by exposing users to predominantly like-minded content, due to segregated friendship networks, algorithmic filtering, and/or their own decisions (1\u20133, 50\u201352, 58). Such users may be pulled toward more extreme attitudes or views consistent with their initial ideology. These effects may be enhanced by the prevalence of content that is extreme, sensational, or focused on negative portrayals of the outgroup (2, 59). Polarization may also be increased by exposure to content from the opposite side of the political spectrum due to backlash effects or distorted perceptions (2, 41). Social media access may affect perceived legitimacy of the election by exposing users to content that undermines and/or supports legitimacy, including messages about electoral fraud, unreliability of voting machines, voter suppression, foreign interference, and infringement of press freedom and free speech. Concerns about legitimacy played a particularly large role in the 2020 election, with Democrats emphasizing issues of voter access and Republicans emphasizing the possibility of voter fraud. Many also remained concerned about the possibility of foreign interference similar to what had occurred in 2016 and about infringement of press freedom and free speech (60\u201364). Claims and allegations about all of these issues were widely circulated on social media both before and after the election (31, 64\u201366). Social media access may affect participation, including turning out to vote, attending protests, signing petitions, and discussing politics online. Social media provides the most important online forum for political discussions (2), so it could directly increase the likelihood of online participation. It could affect the likelihood of offline participation and turnout through several channels, including increasing or decreasing overall interest in the election, providing information about polling places and candidates, and simply crowding out time that would have been used for these other activities. Finally, social media access may affect vote choice and candidate favorability. Both candidates deployed substantial resources to sway voters to their side on social media and/or encourage their supporters to turn out and vote. These efforts included an estimated 1.6 billion dollars spent on digital advertising, as well as various forms of unpaid content and promotion (67). It may have been that one campaign or the other was more effective in these efforts on net, and/or that different groups of voters were swayed in different directions. The broader body of content voters see on social media could also sway them to one side or the other.\n\nExperimental Design This section provides a high-level overview of the experimental design. Details are in SI Appendix, section A. We ran two parallel experiments, with Facebook and Instagram as the respective \u201cfocal platform.\u201d For each focal platform, Meta drew a stratified random sample of users who lived in the United States, were at least 18 y old, and had logged into their account at least once in the past month. Meta placed survey invitations in these users\u2019 focal platform news feeds from August 31 to September 12, 2020. Users who clicked on the invitations were told about the study and asked whether they were willing to deactivate their focal platform account for 1 wk in exchange for $25 and also whether they were willing to deactivate their focal platform account for 6 wk in exchange for $150. Those who were willing to deactivate were asked to complete a series of surveys, including baseline (responses collected September 8 to 21), endline (November 4 to 18), and postendline (December 9 to 23). Individual-level participation in the experimental analyses and surveys was compensated and required informed consent. We believe that the societal benefits of the study (i.e., the knowledge about Facebook\u2019s and Instagram\u2019s impact in the election that will be generated) outweigh its potential harms to respondents, which are not larger than what individuals experience in their ordinary life. The overall project was evaluated and approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago (NORC). Meta sought review from and was granted approval to conduct the experimental studies by the NORC Institutional Review Board (Protocol number 20.08.10, Project number 8870). Academic collaborators also worked with their respective university IRBs to ensure compliance with Human Subjects Research regulations in their authorship of papers, including analysis of aggregated, deidentified data collected by Meta and NORC. Just after the baseline survey, participants were randomized into two groups: Deactivation (27%) and Control (73%). The Control group was informed that they would receive $25 if they did not log in to their focal platform for the next week, while the Deactivation group was informed that they would receive $150 if they did not log in to their focal platform for the next 6 wk. Since the Deactivation condition was more expensive than Control, we allocated fewer participants to the former to increase statistical power per dollar of cost. We included a short deactivation period for the Control group to ensure that the Control and Deactivation experiences were identical except for the deactivation length and payment amount, limiting the risk of differential attrition and experimenter demand effects.* On September 23, Meta began deactivating all participants\u2019 focal platform accounts. The account deactivations were completed by the end of the day on September 23 for Instagram and September 24 for Facebook. Meta reactivated Control and Deactivation group accounts on September 30th and November 4th, respectively. While accounts were deactivated, participants could use their Facebook and Instagram credentials to log in to other apps and services, including WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. The experiment therefore focuses on the impact of the core Facebook and Instagram products. Participants could also choose to log in to (and thereby reactivate) the focal platform at any time. Those who did so were reminded that they would forfeit their deactivation payments, but they were asked to remain in the study and complete the remaining surveys. In addition to the deactivation incentives, participants received base payments of $5 for completing the baseline survey and $20 each for the endline and postendline surveys. In addition to variables drawn from the baseline, endline, and postendline surveys, our analysis incorporates a number of directly measured variables. First, we matched participants to state voting records to produce a validated measure of voter turnout. Second, we matched participants to public records of campaign donations. Third, a subset of participants opted into passive tracking that directly recorded their use of news and social media apps and websites in exchange for an additional payment. Finally, we matched all participants in our primary analysis sample to Meta platform data, including time spent on the platforms.\n\nEmpirical Strategy Our preanalysis plan was registered with the Open Science Foundation on September 22, 2020, and updated on November 3, 2020, the day before endline data collection began.\u2020 It specified the primary analysis sample, the target population for creating sample weights, the primary and secondary outcomes, the subgroup analyses, the estimating equation, and the handling of missing data. It also included shells of key tables and figures. It specified that we would base inference on two-sided tests and that we would use sharpened false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted Q -values (68) to control for multiple hypothesis testing, with Q < 0.05 as our measure of statistical significance for all tests. We did not substantively deviate from the preanalysis plan. SI Appendix, section H describes clarifications and minor modifications, mainly driven by changes in data availability. We characterize our null results using 95% CIs. We note that in some cases, the 95% CI bounds both have the same sign even though the effect is not statistically significant at our preregistered thresholds. Our primary analysis samples are limited to participants who used the focal platform for more than 15 min per day at baseline. We weight the samples to be representative of U.S. focal platform users on race, political party, education, and (among those with more than 15 min of daily use) baseline account activity. See SI Appendix, section A.5 for additional details. We use an instrumental variables regression to estimate the causal effect of deactivation while accounting for imperfect compliance with deactivation. In SI Appendix, section D.1, we report intent-to-treat effects based on ordinary least squares regressions of outcomes on an indicator for assignment to treatment. We define D i as a measure of participant i \u2019s deactivation compliance, X i as a vector of controls, \u03bd s as a vector of randomization stratum indicators, and Y i as an outcome. The estimating equation is Y i = \u03c4 D i + \u03c1 X i + \u03bd s + \u03b5 i , [1] where we instrument for D i with a Deactivation group indicator variable T i . SI Appendix, section B includes more details on variable construction. As prespecified, the controls X i are the variables selected in a lasso regression of Y i on the baseline value of Y i (if available) and a vector of demographics and baseline survey variables. We use the same vector X i in all subgroup analyses for a given outcome. The compliance measure is defined as D i = ( U \u00af C \u2212 U i ) / U \u00af C , where U i is the share of days that i used the platform (defined by viewing five or more pieces of content) during the September 30 to November 3 treatment period and U \u00af C is the Control group average. Thus, D i = 1 for participants who never use the platform, D i = 0 for participants with usage equal to the Control group average, and \u03c4 measures the local average treatment effect of never using the platform instead of using the Control group average, for people induced to deactivate by the $150 payment. We emphasize a number of important limitations that readers should keep in mind in interpreting the results. Similar caveats also apply to prior experimental studies of social media including refs. 5, 37, and 38. First, readers should be cautious about generalizing beyond our specific sample and time period. Our estimates are only directly informative about the set of people who agreed to participate in the study and were willing to deactivate their accounts for the payments we offered, and we do not know what the effects might have been in a different year or outside of an election period. However, we do think our results can inform readers\u2019 priors about the potential effects of social media in the final weeks of high-profile national elections. Second, we can only estimate the effect of 5 wk of individual-level deactivation. Longer-term deactivation could have different effects, and deactivating many users or eliminating Facebook or Instagram altogether could have broader \u201cgeneral equilibrium\u201d effects on how people get information and what media outlets cover. Third, although we include a number of directly measured outcomes, many key outcome variables are self-reported, raising the possibility of various forms of measurement error. Fourth, although we designed our experiment to minimize the possibility of experimenter demand effects (e.g., requiring both Control and Deactivation participants to deactivate their accounts for at least some time), and although past work (5, 69) implies that experimenter demand effects in our context may be limited, participants were aware that they were part of an experiment, and we cannot rule out the possibility that this influenced their behavior.\n\nSample, Compliance, and Substitution Sample Characteristics. We summarize the characteristics of our sample in SI Appendix, section C. On Facebook, a total of 10.6 million users were invited to the study. 673,388 clicked the invitation, of whom 52,821 consented to participate and were willing to deactivate. Of these, 19,857 completed the baseline survey, could be linked to platform data, and had more than 15 min of baseline use per day. This final group is our \u201cprimary analysis sample.\u201d Of the primary analysis sample, 5,691 people opted into passive tracking. On Instagram, the analogous numbers are 2.6 million invites, 319,271 clicks, 51,955 consents, 15,585 participants in the primary analysis sample, and 3,822 people in passive tracking. Relative to the broader target populations of Facebook and Instagram users, our sample overrepresents users who are more liberal and more engaged with civic content. Our weighting strategy addresses selection on these variables. In SI Appendix, Tables S6 and S7, we show that differential selection on these characteristics is mainly driven by the users who select into our screening survey at the initial stage, and that characteristics of the sample are relatively stable from then on. The degree of selection into our experiment is comparable to that in the prior literature. In ref. 5, recruitment ads were shown to 1.9 million users; 2,897 completed baseline and were randomized. In ref. 38, recruitment ads were shown to 365,599 users; 556 completed baseline and were randomized. In ref. 37, recruitment ads were shown to a large set of Texas A&M undergraduates, with the exact number who received them not reported; of the 1,929 individuals who responded, 167 completed baseline and were randomized. Balance and Attrition. The Deactivation and Control groups were balanced on observable characteristics at both baseline and endline; see SI Appendix, Tables S12 and S13. In our Facebook primary analysis sample, 91% of the Deactivation group and 89% of the Control group completed the endline survey. In the Instagram sample, the corresponding shares are 88% and 86%. Our attrition rates of 9 to 14% compare favorably to prior work\u2014e.g., they are similar to ref. 37, lower than ref. 38, and lower than the mean of 96 field experiments published in top economics journals that were surveyed by Ghanem et al. (70). The roughly 2 percentage point difference between attrition rates in Deactivation and Control is also comparable to prior work (70). Given our large sample, these differences are statistically significant for both samples; see SI Appendix, Table S14. There were also differences in the timing of response, with Deactivation participants generally completing the endline survey earlier than Control participants; see SI Appendix, Fig. S2. While this attrition is an important potential concern, we discuss a range of evidence below suggesting that it is unlikely to be a source of substantial bias in our estimates. Compliance. Fig. 1 presents the share of participants who used Facebook and Instagram (defined as logging in and seeing at least five pieces of content) for each day of the experiment. Before the experiment, about 90% of users in the Deactivation and Control groups accessed the focal platform on a given day. During the period when both groups were being paid to avoid logging in and the deactivation process had been completed for all users (September 25 to 29 for Facebook and September 24 to 29 for Instagram), the daily usage rate was roughly 10 to 15%. From September 30 to November 3, the 5-wk \u201ctreatment period\u201d when only the Deactivation group was being paid to avoid logging in, that group\u2019s daily usage rate was roughly 15 to 20%, while the Control group\u2019s usage rate returned close to baseline levels. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Share of participants using Facebook and Instagram during study period. Note: This figure presents the share of Deactivation and Control groups that used Facebook and Instagram on each day. \u201cUse\u201d is defined as logging in and seeing five or more pieces of content. The dark gray shaded area indicates the Control group\u2019s 7-d deactivation period, while the light gray shaded area indicates the Deactivation group\u2019s 35-d additional deactivation period. We exclude Facebook use data from October 27th due to a logging error. Thus, the experiment reduced the Deactivation group\u2019s daily usage rate by about ( 0.9 \u2212 0.15 ) / 0.9 \u2248 83 % relative to Control over the treatment period. This illustrates the first stage of the instrumental variables estimator in Eq. 1. Consistent with results in refs. 5 and 71, the Deactivation group was still less likely to use the platforms at the end of December, almost 2 mo after the deactivation incentive had ended. In SI Appendix, Fig. S5 and Table S27, we show this amounted to reductions (relative to Control) of 23% and 15% in average time spent over the postdeactivation period for Facebook and Instagram, respectively. Substitution. The treatment effects we estimate below are the combined effect of reducing Facebook or Instagram use and reallocating that time to other activities. How that time is reallocated is a key determinant of the effects (72). For example, if participants reallocated most of their social media time to consuming high-quality news sources that generally provide accurate information, the impacts could be quite different than if they allocated most of that time to less accurate sources or to activities unrelated to news or politics. Fig. 2 presents the effects of Facebook and Instagram deactivation on use of substitutes. The first three rows of each panel show effects on time spent on other mobile apps, as directly measured among participants who opted into passive tracking. As a point of reference, the Facebook and Instagram Control group participants in the passive tracking sample spent about 43 and 16 min per day, respectively, on the Facebook and Instagram mobile apps during the treatment period. Facebook deactivation increased time spent on Instagram, other social media apps (such as YouTube, Twitter, and Snapchat), and news apps (such as the New York Times and Fox News), by point estimates of about 2, 8, and 1 min per day, respectively. Together, these point estimates sum to about 26% of the passive tracking sample Control group\u2019s average Facebook mobile app use during the treatment period, with the remaining time going to other apps and to activities we did not observe. Instagram deactivation caused almost no substitution to Facebook or news apps, but it increased time spent on other social media apps by a point estimate of 8 min per day. Together, the point estimates sum to about 57% of the passive tracking sample Control group\u2019s average Instagram mobile app use. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Effects of Facebook and Instagram Deactivation on use of substitutes. Note: This figure presents local average treatment effects of Facebook (A) or Instagram (B) deactivation estimated using Eq. 1. Facebook/Instagram app minutes, other news apps minutes, and minutes on other social apps are measured only for participants who opted into passive tracking of apps. The bottom rows in each panel use self-reported answers to the question, \u201cHow often in the past week have you gotten political information from the following sources?\u201d Responses were coded as \u201cevery day\u201d = 7, \u201cseveral times\u201d = 3, \u201conce\u201d = 1, and \u201cnever\u201d = 0. The horizontal lines represent 95% CI. The bottom eight rows of each panel show that both Facebook and Instagram deactivation reduced the amount of political information that participants self-reported getting from online news outlets, as well as from network, cable, and local TV news outlets. Facebook deactivation also reduced political information from radio. In total, across all sources reported, the Facebook and Instagram Deactivation groups reported getting political information just over one time per week less. This is a reduction of about 4% relative to the Control group average of 26 times per week. One explanation is that deactivation reduces the amount of content from these outlets that people receive through Facebook or Instagram, and this is not outweighed by any increase in direct access. Other possible explanations are that deactivation reduced attention to political content on these other media or that these self-reports are inaccurate (73).\n\nDiscussion Our findings paint a nuanced picture of the way Facebook and Instagram influenced attitudes, beliefs, and behavior in the 2020 election. We replicate in a new context and a larger sample the prior finding by ref. 5 and Asimovic et al. (38) that access to Facebook leads users to be more informed about events in the news. We present large-scale experimental evidence suggesting that access to Facebook may increase belief in misinformation. Together, these findings are consistent with the fact that both trustworthy news and misinformation circulate widely on the platform, and they highlight the importance of continuing efforts to decrease exposure to the latter. We find no significant effects of social media access on polarization. Our point estimates are consistent with both Facebook and Instagram access slightly increasing affective polarization, but the effects are small relative to the long-term trend in affective polarization. We find no significant effects of either Facebook or Instagram access on issue polarization. This suggests that if Facebook access contributes to political polarization, the effect is either small or accumulates over a longer period than 5 wk. Our estimated effect of Facebook access on self-reported vote choice is large enough to be meaningful in a close election, although it is not significant at our preregistered threshold. The point estimate would be consistent with the Trump campaign using Facebook more effectively than the Biden campaign. It could also reflect the posts from users, pages, and groups to which users were exposed favoring Trump on net. We reiterate that our vote choice estimate applies to the specific population that selected into our experiment and that it cannot be extrapolated to the broader population without strong assumptions. Our results also provide large-scale evidence on the political impact of access to Instagram. Aside from a reduction in online participation, we find no significant impacts of Instagram deactivation on any other primary outcomes. This is true even among younger users, and it suggests that despite Instagram\u2019s rapid growth, Facebook likely remains the platform with the largest impacts on political outcomes. We find precisely estimated zero effects of both Facebook and Instagram access on the perceived legitimacy of the electoral process, including perceptions of electoral fraud (although we do detect negative effects of Facebook access on perceived legitimacy among heavy users). Of course, we do not capture the effect of content shared after election day because our deactivation period had ended. Finally, we find no significant effects of either Facebook or Instagram access on turnout, with CIs that rule out moderate effects. This is true for turnout measured with our survey as well as validated turnout from the voter file. All of these findings are subject to the important caveats described above, including generalizability, a time-limited intervention, general equilibrium effects, self-reported outcomes, and attrition. Notwithstanding its limitations, we believe that this study can usefully inform and constrain the discussion of the effects of social media on American democracy.\n\nSupplementary Material Appendix 01 (PDF)\n\nAcknowledgments We thank participants at the Social Science Research Council (SSRC) Workshop on the Economics of Social Media, the Bay Area Tech Economics Seminar, the Winter Business Economics Conference and seminars at Stanford, University of California Berkeley, and the University of Chicago Harris School for helpful comments and suggestions.

All of their work on the study was conducted while they were employed by Meta. The following academic authors have had one or more of the following funding or personal financial relationships with Meta (paid consulting work, received direct grant funding, received an honorarium or fee, served as an outside expert, or own Meta stock): M.G., A.M.G., B.N., J.P., J.S., R.T., M.W., N.J.S., and J.A.T. The costs of the study were funded by Meta. None of the academic researchers nor their institutions received financial compensation from Meta for their participation in the project. The overall project was evaluated and approved by the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) Institutional Review Board (IRB). Academic researchers coordinated with their specific university IRBs to ensure they followed regulations concerning human subject research when analyzing data collected by NORC and Meta as well as when authoring papers based on the results. Additionally, the research group was provided ethical counsel by the independent company Ethical Resolve to inform the study designs. For additional information about the above disclosures as well as a review of the steps taken to protect the integrity of the research, see SI Appendix, sections F and G.\n\nFootnotes Reviewers: L.B., University of Chicago; and R.D., National University of Singapore. *For more context on the design choices, see SI Appendix, section A.4. \u2020The PAP is publicly available from https://osf.io/t9q2f. \u2021For example, a one SD increase in Trump favorability is associated with a 0.6 unit increase in Trump vote in the Control group. Since deactivation reduced Trump favorability by a point estimate of 0.013 SD (with a 95% CI lower bound of 0.030 SD), one might thus expect Trump vote to decrease by 0.013 \u00d7 0.6 = 0.0078 units (with a 95% CI lower bound of 0.018 units), which is closer to zero than the actual point estimate of 0.026 units. \u00a7From November 4 to 16, perceived legitimacy dropped substantially among Republicans while increasing substantially among Democrats; see SI Appendix, Figs. S13 and S14.\n\nData, Materials, and Software Availability Deidentified data and analysis code from this study will be stored in the Social Media Archive (SOMAR) housed by the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) (77). This will be accessible for university research approved by Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) related to elections or for the purpose of validating the results of this study.

        "text": "Trump pledges to scrap offshore wind projects on \u2018day one\u2019 of presidency\nDonald Trump has vowed to immediately halt offshore wind energy projects \u201con day one\u201d of a new term as US president, in his most explicit threat yet to the industry and the latest in a series of promises to undo key aspects of the transition to cleaner energy.\n\nTrump repeated false accusations about wind projects as being lethal to whales during a rally on Saturday in Wildwood, a resort city on New Jersey\u2019s coast, promising to stamp out an industry that has been enthusiastically backed by Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cWe are going to make sure that that ends on day one,\u201d Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for November\u2019s presidential election, said of the offshore wind farms. \u201cI\u2019m going to write it out in an executive order. It\u2019s going to end on day one.\u201d\n\nThe twice-impeached former president, currently facing four separate criminal indictments, said aquatic wind turbines \u201ccause tremendous problems with the fish and the whales\u201d. He added that whales \u201ccome up all the time, dead\u201d, comparing a beached whale carcass to Chris Christie, a former New Jersey governor and rare Republican critic of Trump.\n\n\u201cThey destroy everything, they\u2019re horrible, the most expensive energy there is,\u201d Trump said of the wind turbines. \u201cThey ruin the environment, they kill the birds, they kill the whales.\u201d\n\nTrump, who has long complained that wind turbines ruin the view from his golf course in Scotland, has repeatedly railed against the US\u2019s nascent offshore wind industry.\n\n\u201cI hate wind,\u201d he reportedly told a recent fundraising dinner with oil industry executives in which he vowed to scrap various environmental rules, once elected, if he was provided with $1bn in campaign donations.\n\n\u201cIf I were in the offshore wind industry, I would probably be pretty, pretty nervous,\u201d a former Trump administration energy official told the Washington Post.\n\nThere is no evidence that the placement of wind turbines is causing whale deaths, experts have said, with other factors, such as fishing nets, boat strikes, pollution and the climate crisis all cited as far greater threats to marine mammals. But a spate of dead whales have washed up on US east coast beaches, including in New Jersey, providing ammunition to groups, some funded by the fossil fuel industry, that have called for a ban on offshore wind.\n\nLast year, a Danish developer cancelled two major offshore wind projects in New Jersey, which would have provided clean power to 1 million people, due to economic concerns, in a major setback to an industry that Biden has helped foster in an attempt to cut planet-heating emissions from the power sector. Two other projects were recently approved by regulators to go ahead in the state, however.\n\nView image in fullscreen Turbines off the coast of Block Island, Rhode Island. Photograph: Julia Nikhinson/AP\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly concerning, shortsighted and misguided to see these sort of comments,\u201d said Allison McLeod, senior policy director at New Jersey\u2019s League of Conservation Voters and a former marine protected species observer. \u201cThe No 1 threat to our oceans is climate change, and New Jersey as a vested interest in pursuing clean energies to protect our coast and our economy.\u201d\n\nMcLeod said that there has been a concerted misinformation campaign, funded by oil and gas interests, to mislead voters. \u201cBig oil is benefiting from all of this fear mongering,\u201d she said. \u201cPresident Trump wasn\u2019t speaking to average New Jerseyeans here. He was speaking to big oil.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s invective against offshore wind has been accompanied by other attacks on Biden\u2019s climate and environmental policies during his latest presidential campaign. Should he regain the White House, the former president and reality TV host is set to immediately target:\n\nElectric cars\n\nTrump\u2019s animosity towards wind \u2013 and sharks \u2013 is only matched by his seemingly implacable dislike of electric vehicles, which he has falsely accused of not working in cold weather. He told his supporters on Saturday not to buy an electric car, despite his friendship with Tesla boss Elon Musk, because they are \u201cultra-expensive electric vehicles that don\u2019t go far.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn day one I will immediately terminate Joe Biden\u2019s insane electric vehicle mandate and there will be no ban on gas cars or gas trucks,\u201d he told the crowd, to cheers. He added that he will put \u201ca 200% tax on every car that comes in\u201d to the US, although he didn\u2019t specify which countries this tariff would apply to. \u201cThey are forcing them on you,\u201d he said of the current administration.\n\nBiden has not imposed a ban on gasoline-powered cars, instead pushing forward new rules to slash pollution emitted by vehicles that would nudge carmakers towards making non-emitting electric models. American drivers, meanwhile, have been offered tax credits of up to $7,500 per eligible electric car via Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nLast year, more than one millions electric vehicles were sold in the US for the first time, although a far greater transformation in the US car market will be needed to meaningfully cut pollution from a sector that causes more carbon emissions than any other in the country.\n\nGas exports\n\nIn January, Biden\u2019s administration announced a pause in new export licenses for liquified natural gas, following a boom in gas development along the Gulf of Mexico coast. Experts have warned the glut of gas shipments risk blowing apart climate goals.\n\nThis temporary pause will come to a swift end under Trump, the former president said in a Las Vegas rally shortly after the announcement. \u201cI will approve the export terminals on my very first day back,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want plants built in the United States, even though that\u2019s the best thing you could do,\u201d Trump said of Biden\u2019s decision.\n\nThe Paris climate agreement\n\nIn one of the most vivid illustrations of his stance towards the climate crisis, Trump removed the US from the Paris climate agreement during his first White House term.\n\nBiden subsequently rejoined the pact when he became president, vowing that the US will take part in the global effort to take on the \u201cexistential threat\u201d of the climate crisis, but a Trump return will likely undo this despite protestations from other countries and domestic climate campaigners.\n\n\u201cThe Paris climate accord does nothing to actually improve the environment here in the United States or globally,\u201d Mandy Gunasekara, Trump\u2019s former EPA chief of staff, told the Guardian in February. She argued that the agreement puts too little pressure on China, India and other developing countries to reduce their emissions.",

        "text": "Biden expected to quadruple tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles: Source\nThe decision has implications for the 2024 presidential election.\n\nPresident Joe Biden is expected to quadruple tariffs on electric vehicles from China from roughly 25% to 100%, and raise other tariffs on key industries including semiconductors, solar, and batteries in an announcement Tuesday, according to a source familiar with the decision.\n\nThe action has implications for the 2024 presidential election, as Biden aims to bolster his image as being tougher and smarter on China than former President Donald Trump. In key swing states, Biden has vowed to protect American workers from foreign competition and said last month in Pennsylvania that he would significantly raise steel tariffs on China.\n\nThe decision was made after a yearslong-required review of the tariffs that Trump imposed on some $300 billion of imports. Most of those Trump-era tariffs will remain in place.\n\nBy implementing a steep increase on EV tariffs, the Biden administration aims to prevent a flood of cars made in China from hitting the U.S. market -- a market China has not been a significant player in up to this point.\n\nThe level of the tariffs on the additional sectors were not clear as of Monday.\n\nPHOTO: President Joe Biden speaks during a visit to General Motors' Factory ZERO all-electric vehicle assembly plant in Detroit, Nov. 17, 2021. Emily Elconin/Bloomberg via Getty Images, FILE\n\nTrump has said he would consider imposing tariffs of 60% or more on all Chinese imports and mocked Biden's plan during his rally in New Jersey this weekend.\n\n\"He says he's going to put a 100% tariff on all Chinese electric vehicles. Isn't that nice?\" Trump said. \"Biden should have done this four years ago.\"\n\nThe Biden administration claims its approach is more targeted and strategic than Trump's approach.\n\nPresident Biden has focused on improving domestic manufacturing and increasing green energy investments during his administration. The tariffs point to growing concerns that overproduction of these kinds of goods by China could significantly hurt his agenda \u2013 particularly in an election year when both candidates are pledging to be tough on China.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Wildwood, N.J., May 11, 2024. Matt Rourke/AP\n\nBut some economists warn that increasing tariffs will inflame tensions with China, increase costs to consumers, and worsen inflation.\n\nIan Bremmer, the president and founder of Eurasia Group, a political risk research and consulting firm, said the higher tariffs on EVs could complicate Biden's climate agenda.\n\nBremmer said that \"Chinese vehicles are far better on the EV side than anyone else out there.\"\n\n\"The interesting political point here is that Biden is meant to be the pro-climate president,\" Bremmer said. \"But we don't support reducing emissions when it comes at the expense of American labor. And we don't care if that means it's less competitive and the Americans are going to have access to more expensive, low quality electric vehicles. That's the message that they're sending.\"\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk said in his company's earnings call earlier this year that Chinese car companies are the \"most competitive car companies in the world.\"\n\n\"Frankly, I think if there are not trade barriers established, they will pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world,\" Musk added.\n\nNew Electric cars made by MG, Hong Kong on March 1, 2024. Bob Henry/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images, FILE\n\nDuring her visit to China last month, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned about growing investments in \"new\" industries targeted by the PRC's industrial policy,\" including electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries and solar.\n\n\"China is now simply too large for the rest of the world to absorb this enormous capacity. Actions taken by the PRC today can shift world prices. And when the global market is flooded by artificially cheap Chinese products, the viability of American and other foreign firms is put into question,\" Yellen said in press conference remarks in China.\n\n\"We've seen this story before. Over a decade ago, massive PRC government support led to below-cost Chinese steel that flooded the global market and decimated industries across the world and in the United States. I've made clear that President Biden and I will not accept that reality again,\" she added.",

The principles of practice were developed by the ATA Clinician Council, to address barriers to the broad adoption of telehealth and virtual care delivery, including emerging platforms that support technology-enabled healthcare. This includes creating a Trust Agenda that focuses on responsibility, credibility, and integrity within the healthcare industry.\n\n\u201cThe ATA believes we have an important opportunity \u2013 and an obligation \u2013 to better inform the public, patients, consumers and clinicians, payers, policymakers and other stakeholders about the benefits of telehealth, and to create an evidence base for the appropriate and effective use of telehealth in any clinical discipline,\u201d said Ann Mond Johnson, CEO, the ATA. \u201cThese principles, developed by the ATA\u2019s Clinician Council, inform the work of the ATA in driving policy, collaborating with other organizations, and establishing expectations with current and prospective members.\u201d\n\nGuiding directives reflected in the drafting of these principles include:\n\nTelehealth is an essential care modality to address gaps in today\u2019s healthcare system.\n\nAs such, telehealth is used to reimagine how healthcare is delivered.\n\nPatient care is enhanced when clinicians use the right care modality in a legal, ethical and appropriate manner.\n\nRead the ATA\u2019s new Principles of Practice here.\n\n\u201cThese principles will act as a bellwether for our work and for the telehealth community at large,\u201d said Joe Kvedar, MD, Professor, Harvard Medical School; Co-Chair, AMA DMPAG; Editor-in-Chief, npj Digital Medicine; Board member and Senior Clinical Advisor, the ATA; and Chair of the ATA Clinician Council. \u201cThis is a foundational framework upon which we will continue to build the resources, guidance and outreach to break down barriers to the adoption of telehealth.\u201d\n\nAbout the ATA\n\nAs the only organization completely focused on advancing telehealth, the American Telemedicine Association is committed to ensuring that everyone has access to safe, affordable, and appropriate care when and where they need it, enabling the system to do more good for more people. The ATA represents a broad and inclusive member network of leading healthcare delivery systems, academic institutions, technology solution providers and payers, as well as partner organizations and alliances, working to advance industry adoption of telehealth, promote responsible policy, advocate for government and market normalization, and provide education and resources to help integrate virtual care into emerging value-based delivery models.\n\n# # #",

        "text": "1968 was an inflection point for the US. Is another one coming in 2024?\nFor many reasons, the 2024 US presidential election will be like no other.\n\nRepublican nominee Donald Trump\u2019s campaign is unprecedented. Never before has a former president who so openly threatens the existence of democracy in the United States been this close to retaking the oath of office.\n\nAt the same time, university campus protests over the war in Gaza are growing. Escalations in these protests and the responses from university administrations have led to scenes of militarised police forcefully arresting protesters.\n\nAlmost universally, commentators are reaching for the same touchstone as they seek to understand what is happening in the US today: the protests and civil discord that framed the 1968 election.\n\nBut how apt are these comparisons, and do they help us understand what is at stake in the election of 2024?\n\nErik S. Lesser/EPA\n\nRead more: Could the Israel-Gaza war hurt Joe Biden's chances of re-election? History might provide a guide\n\nWhat happened in 1968?\n\nThe year 1968 was a tumultuous and decisive inflection point in the history of the US. The events of that year exposed the deep contradictions at the heart of American society \u2013 contradictions that have yet to be resolved.\n\nAs the year got underway, the US had proclaimed its moral leadership of the free world, while ruthlessly escalating its prosecution of the war on Vietnam. Democratic President Lyndon Johnson had assured the American public the US was in the ascendancy \u2013 a claim swiftly undermined by the Tet offensive in January.\n\nJohnson\u2019s legitimacy suffered due to disaffection on both the left and right, combined with his administration\u2019s incoherent war objectives and ineffective strategy. Challenged by several candidates in his own party in the primaries, Johnson announced in late March he would not run again.\n\nThe gap between the promises of racial justice and reality of ongoing racism was also stark. Though the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 were significant in ending legal segregation in the south, civil rights activists argued persistent social and economic racial inequality (including in the north) meant segregation was still the reality for most Black Americans.\n\nThe most prominent advocate of this perspective, Martin Luther King, was gunned down on April 4 at the Lorraine Hotel in Tennessee. This act of racist hate sent shockwaves through Black America. Protests erupted, resulting in more than 40 deaths.\n\nAnother Civil Rights Act was passed, but for many \u2013 especially the burgeoning ranks of militant Black nationalists \u2013 King\u2019s devastating assassination represented the entrenched violence of a state built on white supremacy.\n\nAP\n\nAfter the shooting, former attorney-general and Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy famously called for calm. His bid for the presidency inspired many impassioned activists who threw themselves into campaigning. Kennedy had a unique ability to build a coalition incorporating student activists, white suburbanites, Black communities, migrant sharecroppers and sections of organised labour.\n\nOn June 5, Kennedy won the Democratic primary in California. Moments after his victory speech, he was shot and rushed to hospital. He died the next day.\n\nTwo months later, the Democratic Party held its national convention in Chicago, a city tightly controlled by the old-school conservative Democratic mayor, Richard J. Daley. Daley tried to clamp down on any dissent. Protesters of all stripes assembled in defiance.\n\nAP\n\nInside the convention centre, the unruly proceedings revealed deep divisions within the Democratic Party over the Vietnam War. Outside, the protesters\u2019 vision of participatory direct democracy clashed violently with the forces of the city police, a symbol of institutional governance.\n\nThe Democratic nomination was won by Hubert Humphrey, Johnson\u2019s vice president. Though once lauded for his liberalism, Humphrey had strongly associated himself with Johnson\u2019s war policy. After Kennedy\u2019s assassination, Humphrey\u2019s most serious challenge came from the anti-war candidacy of Eugene McCarthy. But with strong support from within the Democratic establishment, Humphrey prevailed, to the disdain of many anti-war party activists.\n\nThe legacies of 1968\n\nFor Nixon, the Republican nominee, the scenes from the Democratic convention playing out on the nightly news were a boost. How could a party that could not govern itself govern the nation?\n\nNixon unleashed a cynical campaign of thinly veiled racism, positioning himself as the candidate of states\u2019 rights and \u201claw and order\u201d.\n\nAP\n\nAs the year went on, the third-party candidacy of the avid segregationist and former Democrat George Wallace attracted significant support from white voters in the deep south as part of the racist backlash against civil rights, as well. Nixon similarly appealed to these voters as part of the Republicans\u2019 emerging \u201csouthern strategy\u201d to win white voters in the south who had previously been Democratic supporters.\n\nThe 1968 election was closer than many expected, but a combination of disenchantment with the Democrats, Wallace\u2019s third-party candidacy and a general sense of malaise led to Nixon\u2019s narrow victory.\n\nThen came the the US bombing campaigns against Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. And in 1972, Watergate.\n\nThe upheaval of 1968 and the years that followed exposed fissures in American society and raised serious questions about how united the country actually was. It made clear there were different Americas \u2013 and these versions of the country were not reconciled to each other. The house was divided. These differences remain as stark as ever today.\n\nWhat\u2019s at stake in 2024?\n\nThe year 1968 continues to have such symbolic power because it marked the transformation from the hope and idealism of the 1960s to the cynicism and despondency of the 1970s.\n\nThe contradictions of that era were also never resolved. 1968 was a year of contest in which different visions of what America was \u2013 and what it could and should be \u2013 dramatically clashed. This social polarisation was expressed through regular political violence that fundamentally changed the nation.\n\nTrump exposed these social fissures first as president, and now (again) as nominee. But 2024 is not a repeat of 1968 \u2013 it\u2019s a continuation of the same issues that have torn at the country\u2019s fabric for decades.\n\nRead more: Why 'wokeness' has become the latest battlefront for white conservatives in America\n\nTrump\u2019s presidential bids have revealed the deep state of division that persists in the US. His support is sustained by the political revanchism of those who actively seek to perpetuate America\u2019s historic injustices and have mobilised behind his banner to retain their social power.\n\nTheir unwavering support for Trump, and willingness to continue to mobilise regardless of electoral outcomes, means that whatever the poll result is in November, the threat to American democracy that Trumpism poses will persist.\n\nUntil this fundamental reality is confronted and overcome, the country will continue to live in the shadows of 1968.",

        "text": "RFK Jr. Sues Meta, Says Presidential Campaign Video Censored (2)\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. sued Meta Platforms Inc. in federal court on Monday claiming Facebook and Instagram censored his presidential campaign documentary.\n\nThe two Meta-owned social media platforms removed \u201cWho is Bobby Kennedy,\u201d a film produced by his political action committee, shortly after its May 3 release and blocked users from \u201cwatching, sharing, or even posting a link to it,\u201d Kennedy and his American Values 2024 PAC alleged.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California, claimed Meta blocked the 30-minute video detailing Kennedy\u2019s career and his criticism of vaccines because the federal government has repeatedly demanded suppressing the independent candidate\u2019s communications.\n\nThe complaint pointed to a pending Supreme Court case, Murthy v. Missouri, which involves claims that the Biden administration coerced social media companies of banning anti-vaccine content.\n\nMeta claimed to have reversed its ban on the film on May 5, according to the complaint, but Kennedy said the company is still \u201ccontinuing to throttle, de-boost, demote, and shadow-ban the film,\u201d including on Meta\u2019s AI chatbot.\n\n\u201cThis goes beyond restricting freedom of expression on issues and ideas,\u201d Kennedy said in a campaign press release. \u201cMeta is censoring a biographical film about a major candidate in an election year.\u201d\n\nMeta said in an emailed statement that the link to Kennedy\u2019s video \u201cwas mistakenly blocked and was quickly restored once the issue was discovered.\u201d\n\nKennedy, who dropped out of the Democratic presidential primary last year to run as an independent in November, previously sued Google LLC\u2019s YouTube over censorship in the same court. The prominent anti-vaccine activist alleged in the August 2023 lawsuit that the platform worked with the Biden administration to remove videos of him questioning the efficacy of the Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nA federal judge denied Kennedy\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction, which he appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Oral arguments for the appeal are scheduled for Tuesday.\n\nYale Law Professor Jed Rubenfeld, Richard Jaffe Esq., and Roger Ian Teich represent Kennedy and the PAC.\n\nThe case is Kennedy, Jr. v. Meta Platforms Inc., N.D. Cal., No. 3:24-cv-02867, 5/13/24.",

        "summary": " Trump restricted legal immigration in his first term . Will it happen again? Trump's focus on the border has dominated the political discourse on immigration this election cycle . But legal immigration is also in play in a potential second term, with the announcement of some drastic cuts to foreign workers .",
        "text": "Trump restricted legal immigration in his first term. Will it happen again?\nFormer President Donald Trump\u2019s focus on the border and his ongoing vow to launch the biggest \u201cdomestic deportation operation\u201d have dominated the political discourse on immigration this election cycle. But legal immigration is also in play in a potential second Trump term, with the announcement of some drastic cuts to foreign workers.\n\nTrump\u2019s record on immigration, as well as his playbook of proposals called Project 2025 \u2014 spearheaded by the conservative Heritage Foundation with input from former Trump administration officials \u2014 offer a good idea of what could be in store for noncitizens who have come into the U.S. or are trying to come through legal means.\n\nDuring his administration, Trump made it harder for foreign-born workers to enter the U.S. on visas or as refugees. Under his watch, visa denials and extensions shot up and refugee admissions were slashed.\n\nWithout renewed visas, some U.S. businesses lost employees who had to leave when their work permits expired. Also, far fewer green cards were issued to people not already in the U.S., according to the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank that advocates for expanding legal immigration.\n\n\u201cWhat we saw last time, you would see again, but likely on steroids the next time around,\u201d said Stuart Anderson, executive director of the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan think tank on trade and immigration.\n\nPolicy and regulation changes under Trump, combined with the pandemic, led to a reduction in the U.S. foreign workforce, resulting in a significant decrease in the growth of the gross domestic product, economist Madeline Zavodny wrote in a policy brief for the foundation.\n\nZavodny said that between 2016 and 2022 the GDP growth fell, but, had the foreign-born, working-age population continued to grow, the GDP would have been about $335 billion larger than it was. The foreign worker slowdown began before Covid, but was exacerbated by it, she wrote.\n\n\u201cA slower-growing working-age population means a smaller increase in the number of people to produce goods and services and to generate new ideas that lead to technological progress and long-run growth. A slower-growing or shrinking working-age population also increases the potential for price pressures and shortages,\u201d Zavodny wrote.\n\nTrump\u2019s technical changes to legal immigration were not the sort to grab headlines, but they did affect people who had \"followed the rules\" to legally work and live in the U.S.\n\nAnderson, who has written about Trump\u2019s effect on legal immigration, wrote in a January column for Forbes that after Trump took office, the denial rate for applications for H1-B visas for initial employment rose to 24% for the 2018 fiscal year and 21% in 2019; meanwhile, denial rates for H1-B visa renewals went up 12% in 2018 and 2019.\n\nFollowing a lawsuit in 2020, the rates fell to 2% in 2022. But, if elected, the Trump team could implement a rule it left pending in 2020 that would reimplement restrictions, according to Anderson.\n\nTrump also used immigration law to block entry of other visa-holders such as L1 visas for transfers within companies before a court ruled he\u2019d exceeded his authority, Anderson wrote.\n\nTrump has been highly critical of Biden\u2019s humanitarian parole program that has allowed in Venezuelans, Cubans, Nicaraguans, Haitians, as well as Ukrainians and Afghans, and vowed to shut it down.\n\n\u201cIf you listen to him, he is very consistent in his focus on immigration. His shorthand on how he would change legal immigration is when he talks about letting in people from nice countries, which is code for white,\u201d said Angela Kelley, a senior adviser at the American Immigration Lawyers Association.\n\nJaime Florez, spokesperson for the Trump campaign, said \"we haven't heard anything from\" Trump or received any formal information about his plans on legal immigration.\n\n\"He understands no immigration reform is going to be successful if we don't have a border that is under control,\" Florez said. \"He understands that most legal immigrants who arrive legally and are still waiting for USCIS to resolve their immigration status are going to be seriously jeopardized by the open border policy of the Biden administration.\"\n\nSome proposals for Trump are spelled out in Project 2025, what its conservative creators are calling a \"mandate for leadership\" should he be re-elected. Florez said that any suggestions that Trump would implement the proposals are \"speculation.\"\n\nProject 2025 calls for immediate rule-making affecting temporary work visas and employment authorization along with a slew of other reversals of Biden's policies, some which undid Trump's changes.\n\n\"Internal efforts to limit employment authorization should be matched by congressional action to narrow statutory eligibility to work in the United States and mitigate unfair employment competition for U.S. citizens,\" the document states. \"The oft-abused H-1B program should be transformed into an elite program through which employers are vying to bring in only the top foreign workers at the highest wages so as not to depress American opportunities.\"\n\nThe Trump playbook also calls for suspending updates to an annual list of countries whose citizens can submit H-2A and H-2B temporary worker visas, which would affect agriculture, hospitality, forestry and construction employers that rely on them for workers.\n\nThis would hit agriculture the hardest, as it could lose up to 10% of its workforce on some farms, according to the Niskanen Center, a libertarian think tank that scrutinized Project 2025.\n\n\"Refusing to update the list would mean that after the expiration of the 2024 list, no countries would be eligible to participate in the program, thus grinding it to a halt,\" the center stated.\n\nProject 2025 is calling for turning U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service personnel into a security agency, thus requiring all workers to be vetted, for steps that would require immigrants to apply more frequently for work permits and an expansion of investigations into the background of potential workers. All would make obtaining benefits more time-consuming and make existing backlogs even longer, the Niskanen Center stated.\n\nThat would put many people legally in the country at risk because the conservatives want Trump to force out of the country any person who is rejected for an immigration benefit or status adjudication, which could include renewing Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), a work permit, student visas, awaiting asylum and a host of other permissions, until USCIS catches up on all case backlogs.\n\nKelley, from the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said the conservatives' recommendations and Trump's previous actions on legal immigration are \"a roadmap telling us this is the path this candidate would take if elected, and it is a roadmap that would lead us over a cliff.\"",

        "text": "Home Prices Come Into Focus as Key Issue in the 2024 Election\nIn most presidential election years, home prices aren\u2019t a key issue for voters or a major campaign talking point.\n\nConsider it another way in which the 2024 election is anything but typical. With mortgage rates up and home prices out of reach for many first-time buyers, the affordability crisis is increasingly in the spotlight as campaign season heats up.\n\nIn March, President Joe Biden delivered a speech on home prices in the key swing state of Nevada after proposing a $10,000 tax credit for first-time buyers and those selling their starter homes.\n\nDonald Trump fired back in a campaign video, accusing Biden of \u201cwaging full-scale war on the suburbs\u201d that would decimate home values by expanding affordable housing options.\n\nIn addition to Nevada, the election will come down to just six other swing states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Trump won all of them but Nevada in 2016, while Biden carried all but North Carolina in 2020. Neither candidate can win this year\u2019s election without taking at least three of the swing states, unless the electoral map changes dramatically before November.\n\nThe debate comes as housing affordability reaches some of the most abysmal levels on record. Nationally, median list prices are up 28% since January 2021, and the home price-to-income ratio is at a record high of nearly 6-to-1, up from a ratio of 4.1-to-1 as recently as 2019.\n\nThe cost burden for renters is also alarmingly high, with nearly half of all renters in the nation spending more than 30% of their income and a quarter spending more than 50% on rent each month, according to U.S. Census data. Those sky-high rental burdens can make it difficult to impossible for many renters to save up for a down payment on their first home.\n\n\u201cHomeownership has for many years been an important part of the American dream, and if people feel like that\u2019s slipping out of reach, we\u2019re going to see that reflected in their attitudes about the election,\u201d says Realtor.com\u00ae Chief Economist Danielle Hale.\n\n\u201cIf people feel like the market itself is not able to meet their needs, then it\u2019s not surprising to see them look to politics to try to find a solution,\u201d she adds.\n\nBiden's proposals to boost affordability\n\nEarlier this year, Biden used his State of the Union address to reveal an ambitious slate of proposals aimed at reducing housing costs. They included a two-year tax credit of $5,000 per year for first-time homebuyers, with a similar one-year $10,000 credit to those selling their first home to trade up.\n\n\u201cI know the cost of housing is so important to you,\u201d Biden said during the annual address to a joint session of Congress. \u201cIf inflation keeps coming down, mortgage rates will come down as well. And the Fed acknowledges that, but I\u2019m not waiting.\u201d\n\nBiden is also proposing various tax credits and spending programs that the administration says could finance the building or renovation of 2 million homes.\n\n\u201cMany of these proposals will need to make their way through Congress first\u2014a particularly arduous task in an election year\u2014though their inclusion in the address underscores the salience of the skyrocketing cost of housing for Americans nationwide,\u201d Moody's associate economist Nick Luettke wrote in a note on Biden\u2019s speech. \"Housing affordability has become a key issue for Americans spanning all demographics and political divides.\"\n\nHowever, Biden\u2019s proposed tax credit for first-time homebuyers has come under scrutiny from some economists, who warn it could push home prices higher by turbocharging demand. Those critics warn that by subsidizing home purchases, the tax credits could draw more buyers into a market already struggling with low inventory, sparking bidding wars and price increases.\n\n\u201cI'm glad we're having the policy discussion, but it seems like so many of the solutions offered by his administration are focused on the demand side, when supply side is where we need to really pick up steam,\u201d says Nicholas Irwin, associate professor of economics and real estate at the University of Las Vegas.\n\n\u201cI don't think by helping to subsidize the demand side, we're going to fix the issue of house prices going up,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe need to build more houses to account for the fact people want to live in houses.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Biden's proposed tax credit for sellers could boost available inventory by nudging homeowners to trade up, argues Alex F. Schwartz, a professor of urban policy at The New School and chair of the master's program in public and urban policy at the university's Milano School of Policy, Management, and Environment.\n\n\"This recognizes that there is sort of a logjam, with people who are not very interested in putting their house units on the market because of the fact that they're at a very favorable interest rate, and they're not going to be able to get that rate when they buy another unit,\" he says of the tax credit for sellers. \"So this would help lubricate that a bit.\"\n\nTrump's scathing counterattack\n\nPresumptive Republican nominee Trump, who first gained fame as a real estate tycoon, is veering in the opposite direction by claiming that Democrats\u2019 efforts to boost home affordability amount to a \u201cwar on the suburbs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe woke left is waging full-scale war on the suburbs, and their Marxist crusade is coming for your neighborhood, your tax dollars, your public safety, and your home,\u201d Trump said in a recent campaign video. \u201cThey will use the power of the federal government to abolish zoning for single-family homes, destroy your property values by building giant multifamily apartment complexes in the suburbs, and even next to your house.\"\n\nThose comments echo Trump's call to limit construction in the suburbs during his presidency, when housing affordability was also a smoldering problem.\n\nAccording to Freddie Mac, the country's housing shortage surged 52% during the 2018 to 2020 years of Trump\u2019s term, reaching a shortfall of 3.8 million units.\n\n\"His record on housing has been abysmal. He is against fair housing,\" says Schwartz, adding that he has difficulty taking Trump's remarks on the subject seriously.\n\nTrump's rhetoric on housing seems aimed squarely at existing homeowners, designed to tap into fears that any effort to reduce housing costs for others will erode their own equity.\n\nThose fears have long been powerful in driving anti-development attitudes, but are often irrational, argues Kenneth Chilton, an associate professor of public administration at Tennessee State University.\n\n\"The fearmongering is intense,\" says Chilton. \"If you're living in a more affluent neighborhood, the price of land is such that, whatever units get built there to increase density, they're not going to be cheap housing. That's just because the price of the land kind of necessitates building more luxurious housing.\n\n\"Some of the research is starting to show that this movement toward higher density does not negatively impact property values. In fact, it can increase property values in certain neighborhoods,\" he adds.\n\nA more valid concern, says Chilton, would be the prospect of rising home values in working-class suburbs potentially pushing out middle-income buyers.\n\nTwo opposing messages for two different voting blocs\n\nTo be sure, housing is far from the only issue that voters will weigh before they cast their ballots in November. Foreign policy, the broader economy, immigration, and the personal qualities of the two candidates are also likely to be key issues, among other topics. But in a tight race that will be decided in a handful of swing states, home prices and affordability could play a key role.\n\nBased on recent polling, housing affordability is a top concern for voters, but neither Democrats nor Republicans seem to hold a natural advantage on the issue. One national survey last month from the University of Michigan and the Financial Times found that concern about one\u2019s own ability to afford housing was evenly distributed politically, with about 70% of Democrats, Republicans, and independents ranking that issue among their top concerns.\n\n\u201cHousing remains one of the few areas of bipartisan agreement, and poll results are consistent with what\u2019s seen nationwide at the state and local levels,\" says Brian Connolly, assistant professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business.\n\nThat suggests housing policy could be one of the few issues that offer both major presidential candidates the chance to win over independent voters. Representatives for the Biden and Trump campaigns did not respond to Realtor.com requests for comment, but their public remarks make their starkly opposed positions on housing policy clear.\n\nBiden\u2019s proposals, aimed at boosting home affordability, are designed to appeal most to renters and other aspiring first-time homeowners (and perhaps their parents and other loved ones who hope to see them buy their first home). Trump\u2019s message, meanwhile, is targeted at homeowners who are perhaps most interested in seeing the value of their own homes continue to rise.\n\nBased purely on demographics, Trump\u2019s message might find a wider potential audience of likely voters.\n\nNationwide, the homeownership rate is about 66%. Homeowners are also more likely to vote than renters, according to a study from Apartment List. In the 2020 election, 55% of renters who were eligible to vote cast a ballot, compared with 71% of homeowners, the study found.\n\n\u201cThere are various reasons for this disparity in political engagement, but a major one is simply property ownership,\u201d the study authors wrote. \u201cHomeowners have a large financial motivation to vote when they perceive that the policies at stake could impact local property values.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, when they do vote, renters are significantly more likely to vote Democratic than homeowners. Biden\u2019s proposals could be aimed at mobilizing turnout from renters seeking to become first-time homebuyers, a constituency that historically heavily favors Democrats.\n\nThe Apartment List study found that in 2020, renters preferred Biden over Trump by a wide margin of 36.5 percentage points. Homeowners narrowly swung for Biden by just 0.6 points in that election, marking the first time a Democrat had won the majority of the homeowner vote since Bill Clinton in 1996.\n\nRecent polling suggests that Biden is struggling with younger voters, traditionally a key Democratic constituency. His emphasis on making homeownership more affordable could be intended to energize those younger voters, who are more likely to be renters.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Biden can boost turnout from renters without alienating homeowners, a balancing act that might prove tricky for the incumbent as he grapples with voter dissatisfaction over the current state of the housing market.\n\n\"The housing market is broken,\" says Chilton. \"There's a lot of different potential reasons for that, but it's just not functioning for people who don't already own. And this is the first time in modern history, post World War II, that we've been in this situation.\"",

Here in Tuolumne Meadows, less-gazed-upon domes and peaks are served with a refreshing dose of serenity in the subalpine terrain. Lurking in the background, just out of view, is Sing Peak, rising 10,552ft from the park's south-eastern corner.\n\n\"The way the topography is with certain ridge lines and perspectives, [Sing Peak] just gets hidden. But it's on our park map \u2013 the one that millions of people receive,\" said Yosemite park ranger Yenyen Chan, explaining that only a few dozen of the hundreds of peaks in Yosemite are listed on the map.\n\nIt's somewhat symbolic that a massive summit named after Chinese American chef Tie Sing in 1899 has remained largely unrecognised in Yosemite for more than a century.\n\nIn fact, Chinese immigrants have long been part of Yosemite's story, from building large parts of the park's early infrastructure to running the kitchen and laundry services at the park's 1856-built Victorian-style Wawona Hotel. Yet, their contributions have remained ignored.\n\nAlamy Many Chinese people originally immigrated to California during the Gold Rush in the late 1840s (Credit: Alamy)\n\nYosemite's Chinese American history has likely been buried because of the nation's long history of anti-Asian sentiment and discrimination. The surge of Chinese who immigrated to California during the Gold Rush in the late 1840s were immediately slapped with a foreign miners tax in 1850 and a hefty $20 a month \"non-citizens\" fee. That forced many to find work in other industries, like hotels and railroads. But then came the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, banning Chinese labourers from entering the country, a policy that remained in place until 1943.\n\nChan, who has been a US Park Ranger since 2003, got her first hint of Yosemite's Chinese American history in 1993 as a park intern, when her supervisor told her that the Chinese built the Tioga Road, which climbs above the valley and crosses the park from east to west back in 1882-83.\n\n\"I thought, 'Why had I never heard of the Chinese being anywhere in the area, let alone this incredibly beautiful wilderness?'\" she said. \"I had no context and felt like very few people knew about it. When I tried looking into it, I could only find very little information.\"\n\nSo, during her downtime, she started researching on her own, scouring libraries throughout California for documents, photographs and any hints of early Chinese contributions to Yosemite. She found that a 56-mile stretch of the Great Sierra Wagon Road, which has mostly become today's Tioga Road, was built by 250 Chinese American and 90 white labourers in a mere 130 days, according to one report.\n\nAlamy Chinese American labourers largely built Yosemite's famous Tioga Road (Credit: Alamy)\n\nEven prior to that, Wawona Hotel owner Henry Washburn had hired a crew of mostly Chinese immigrants, who constructed the Wawona Road around 1874. Working through harsh winter conditions and using handpicks, shovels, axes and blasting powder, the Chinese workers managed to complete the 23-mile road in 18 weeks. Visitors entering Yosemite through the south entrance on Highway 41 today still pass over parts of the road originally built by those workers.\n\nWashburn also staffed his kitchen with Chinese immigrants, led by head chef Ah You, whom he hired in 1886. Though he ran the kitchen until 1910 and worked in the hotel a total of 47 years until 1933, he and the other Chinese workers were often kept out of sight.\n\nMark Twain even immortalised the diligence of California's Chinese labourers in his 1872 travel book Roughing It, writing: \"They are as industrious as the day is long\u2026 and a lazy one does not exist.\"\n\nEventually, a mentor of Chan's encouraged her to put together a seminar and all-day hike about the park's Chinese American history. Among her findings was the background of the peak's namesake Sing. But due to a lack of firsthand records and the unreliability of certain historical documents that were likely altered to protect Chinese workers against anti-Asian policies, Chan's search proved challenging. Case in point: according to records, Sing was born in Nevada to Chinese immigrants. But Chan says Sing also had travel documents with another Chinese name and a wife and at least one child in Hong Kong. \"There are still many unknowns,\" she said.\n\nUS Geological Survey Tie Sing was known as one of California's greatest \"backcountry\" chefs (Credit: US Geological Survey)\n\nWhat is certain is that Sing had a way with people and a knack for whipping up gourmet meals in the most rustic of settings. Assistant Secretary of Interior Stephen Mather had heard of Sing's skills and hired him in 1915 on a pivotal two-week wilderness excursion with a mix of influential politicians, newspaper editors, businessmen and lawyers through the Sierras, which became known as the Mather Mountain Party. The group set out from Visalia, California, to Yosemite to experience the wilderness firsthand. By immersing these luminaries in the beauty of the US' great outdoors, Mather hoped to gain the crucial support he needed to establish the US National Park Service.\n\nSing put all the finest touches on al fresco dining in the woods: white tablecloths with fine china were set on long tables as the guests sat on logs and makeshift chairs, devouring hearty meals of trout and venison and even fresh sourdough bread and apple pie baked in a portable oven. The NPS was formally established the following year.\n\nAs Chan started uncovering and sharing more Chinese stories about Yosemite, she was connected with Jack Shu, the then-California State Park Superintendent, and the Chinese Historical Society of Southern California (CHSSC). Together, they launched the Yosemite Sing Peak Pilgrimage in 2012.\n\nEach year, the group of CHSSC members, avid hikers and history enthusiasts retraces the park's Chinese American pathways, such as walking down the Chinese-built roads and visiting sites where Chinese labourers worked, \"trying to unlock these little historic mysteries\", said longtime CHSSC member and former president Eugene Moy.\n\nGH Grosvenor Sing famously put together an al fresco feast for a group of leaders on the Mather Mountain Party that sowed the seeds of the National Park Service (Credit: GH Grosvenor)\n\n\"A lot of us who have [done CHSSC hikes] tend not to be recent immigrants \u2013 our families have been here a long time,\" Moy explained. \"We have this gap in our past, so we want to walk in the footsteps that our ancestral family members walked to honour and recognise this gap.\u201d\n\nHike Sing Peak The Yosemite Sing Peak Pilgrimage is held 26-28 July 2024, and the backpacking trek to the top of Sing Peak takes place a few days later on 29-30 July.\n\nNow heading into its 12th year (the event was held virtually in 2020), the event sees about 50 to 70 people come together for a weekend of activities, including history talks and a hike along the original Tioga Road, before about 20 people stay on a few more days to summit Sing Peak. Moy says the hike \"satisfies both the historical curiosity and the physical challenge\", which is \"a metaphor for what some of our early forebears did: carving out a road in the middle of winter\".\n\nAnother pilgrimage highlight: potluck dinners. \"The fact that Tie Sing could cook these magnificent meals, we had to do something with cooking and [sharing] in food,\" he added, explaining they often include camp cooking demonstrations.\n\nDuring one of the pilgrimages in 2016 or 2017, the group visited a ramshackle building by the Wawona Hotel that had been its laundry building. Built in 1917 to replace a former laundry business, it fell into disuse and was converted to a carriage shop in the 1950s before becoming a glorified storage unit.\n\nAlamy Yosemite's Chinese Laundry Building has been restored (Credit: Alamy)\n\nThe group had the idea to restore the building and use it as an exhibition space to share the park's untold Chinese American history with visitors. The National Park Service supported the idea and applied for a grant through the Yosemite Conservancy. When Sandra and Franklin Yee learned about the project, they jumped at the opportunity to take part.\n\nSandra's father, a Chinese American who came to the US when he was 14, had first taken his family on holiday to Yosemite in the late 1940s, renting a cabin near Wawona. Completely \"enchanted with the magnificence of Yosemite and Wawona\", Sandra remembers that her father said \"he could spend every summer of his life there. And he did.\"\n\nHe bought a cabin in 1953 in Wawona, which has a mix of public and privately owned land, and now four generations of the family have enjoyed their summer getaways there. The Yees had been searching for a way to honour her parents' love for Yosemite, and they decided to fund the restoration of the so-called Chinese Laundry Building.\n\nLocated right next to the Wawona Hotel, outside of the semicircle of the other historical buildings honouring Yosemite's diverse history \u2013 including that of the Buffalo Soldiers \u2013 the new landmark opened in October 2021. Visitors can now step inside and learn about the park's Chinese American influences \u2013 a true reflection of Chan's decades of research.\n\nAlamy The Chinese Laundry Building sits nearby Yosemite's Pioneer History Center, which honours those who helped create the park (Credit: Alamy)\n\n\"I felt really strongly about these stories being told, but never imagined [they would be] a permanent exhibit Yosemite now maintains,\" Chan said. \"It's very gratifying.\"\n\nStill, Chan thinks that there's still so much more Chinese history that she hopes to reveal, and explains that these influences aren't limited to Yosemite, but were also essential to the early stages of national parks from Sequoia to Yellowstone, and much of the infrastructure of the American West.\n\n\"This is just the tip of the iceberg,\" she said. \"Even though there's just little pieces of information, once you start looking at the connections, you might find that there's an important story that hasn't been told \u2013 and it only helps make us appreciate human history more.\"\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "text": "Election 2024 breakdown: Tim Sheehy, U.S. Senate candidate\nWe\u2019re bringing you coverage of all the major political races this year.\n\nWearing a suit with no tie and casually slicked back hair, Tim Sheehy addressed the elephant in the room at the Montana GOP\u2019s winter kickoff dinner in February.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been criticized by a lot of people, some in this room, that \u2018who the hell is this guy? He\u2019s never been in office before, what does he think he\u2019s doing running for Senate? And that\u2019s a fair criticism, I wake up everyday wondering, \u2018what the hell am I doing?\u201d Sheehy said.\n\nThe presumed Republican frontrunner in Montana\u2019s U.S. Senate race is a new face in politics. He lives in the Gallatin Valley with his wife Carmen, and their four children.\n\nHe\u2019s a former Navy Seal and was awarded the Bronze Star with Valor and the Purple Heart Medal. Sheehy originally from Minnesota but moved to Montana in 2014 and has founded two companies focused on aerial firefighting and drone technology.\n\nIn 2020, he bought land along the Little Belt Mountains and started a 20,000 acre cattle ranch with two partners.\n\nHis latest venture is taking on incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Tester. He told Republicans at the kickoff dinner he\u2019ll need broad support to win.\n\n\u201cTo sum it up, I\u2019m here because I love this country, I fought for this country, I\u2019ve lost friends for this country, my wife fought for this country. Our country is in great peril. We are at a crossroads of the nation,\u201d Sheehy said.\n\nTim Sheehy, a former Navy Seal and multi-millionaire business owner from Bozeman, has GOP establishment support.\n\nBut now, he must convince Montanans he\u2019s the right person for the job.\n\nSheehy is one of three Republicans in his party\u2019s primary race for the Senate. But party leaders are backing Sheehy and his campaign coffers are by far the richest.\n\nThe general election stakes include the political balance of the United States Senate and the chance for Republicans to control all statewide offices in Montana.\n\nSheehy is backed by U.S. Sen. Steve Daines and was endorsed by former President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump\u2019s son, Don Trump Jr., rallied for Sheehy and other Republican candidates at a recent fundraiser. He said Sheehy is the best shot the party has at taking control of the U.S. Senate.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t do it now, it\u2019s a decade til we even have a chance. Meaning a chance where there\u2019s like a red state with a blue state senator in it that\u2019s up for election that we can actually make gains, for a decade,\u201d Trump, Jr.\n\nSheehy says he decided to get into politics after the Biden Administration\u2019s final withdrawal from Afghanistan resulted in Taliban rule and the killing of 13 U.S. service members and 180 Afghans. The Biden White House has said it was constrained by the previous administration and blamed Trump for the chaotic withdrawal.\n\n\u201cWe gave up our 20s to fight for this country. And Biden literally washed it all away, and didn\u2019t even say sorry for it, just walked away,\u201d Sheehy said. \u201cAnd I knew right then that I had to get involved. It was kind of as a surrogate speaker and donor at first, and then some folks said, hey, we think you might be a good candidate, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re here.\u201d\n\nSheehy says his lack of political experience is a strength. If Sheehy wins, he'll be a freshman in the Senate taking the seat of a 17-year senator who chairs Senate veteran affairs and the appropriations defense subcommittee.\n\n\u201cPeople decry every single day career politicians, people who go into government for their entire life \u2013 50 years, 30 year, 40 years, whatever it is \u2013 and yet when someone new comes along to try to bring a fresh face and fresh set of ideas, they\u2019re immediately attacked and disparaged. And I think there\u2019s a lot of hypocrisy there,\u201d Sheehy said.\n\nSheehy\u2019s ideas for Congress include cutting the federal budget by shrinking the executive branch. He says the U.S. Departments of Education and Homeland Security could be eliminated, arguing they add bureaucracy for services states and local communities should provide.\n\n\u201cWe have a blended homeschool model with our kids, you know, they go to a co-op with other faith-based, ag families. It\u2019s like, we don\u2019t have the federal government giving us a handbook saying teach your children this. We don\u2019t need that,\u201d Sheehy said.\n\nSheehy says that could work for other communities.\n\nSheehy has called for the U.S. to complete Trump\u2019s wall at the southern border, saying it needs to be sealed to prevent illegal immigration. He\u2019s also been critical of the passage of a $95 billion foreign aid package that a majority of Republican senators supported. He says the U.S. has stretched itself too thin in its foreign policy.\n\nWhile Sheehy has the party\u2019s top brass by his side, he still has to convince Montanans, including some Republicans, he\u2019s right for the job.\n\nNathaniel Palmer is a conservative-leaning voter and U.S. Army veteran from Billings. He says he\u2019s dissatisfied with Tester\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cSo, somebody new would probably be better. The issue is, I don\u2019t know much about the other person to say I support them. I know that they say they\u2019re a vet and everything, but that doesn\u2019t mean a lot to me, cause you can say, well I\u2019m a nice person, and be completely not. So it\u2019s like actions are what really dictate, and I unfortunately don\u2019t know that person very well,\u201d Palmer said.\n\nSheehy is at a disadvantage in name recognition, and faces other hurdles, too.\n\nThe Washington Post first reported that Sheehy was cited in 2015 for accidentally discharging a firearm in Glacier National Park. The story raised questions about where a bullet lodged in Sheehy\u2019s forearm came from. Sheehy says it is an undisclosed relic from his days in active combat and he lied to a park ranger about getting shot in Glacier by a gun falling out of his vehicle. Sheehy says he was trying to protect his platoon mates from an investigation.\n\nSheehy went to the hospital on the day of the Glacier Park incident. His timeline of events is inconsistent with the park ranger\u2019s. However, he\u2019s declined to release his medical records that may show whether the bullet wound was old or new.\n\nHe says he shouldn\u2019t have to release medical records if Tester doesn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty ridiculous that after serving my country and being wounded overseas, I\u2019m being forced to present medical records \u2013 I ran and got an x-ray to prove to the Washington Post after they were trying to convict me in the court of public opinion that I was fake veteran of stolen valor. So I think it\u2019s pretty insulting and ridiculous,\u201d Sheehy said.\n\nThe Washington Post reported the x-ray was inconclusive in determining when the injury occurred. Sheehy\u2019s Bronze Star and Purple Heart are unrelated to the injury and not in question. Questions about the bullet wound did not arise until the National Park Service citation was published.\n\nAside from making headlines over the bullet wound, Sheehy has faced some distrust within his own party.\n\nThat includes Al Olszewski, a surgeon and former state legislator who chairs the Flathead County Republican Central Committee. He posted a video to Facebook with a \u201ccall to action\u201d after party leaders backed Sheehy in the Senate race instead of Congressman Matt Rosendale, who has since dropped out.\n\n\u201cRespectfully decline and oppose our party bosses and our rulers who are continuing to shove down our throats their demands and their pet candidates,\u201d Olszewski said.\n\nThe GOP primary also includes former Secretary of State and Public Service Commissioner Brad Johnson. Johnson has raised a fraction of Sheehy\u2019s warchest, and has been left out of party functions rallying for candidates.\n\nWhen he announced his candidacy, Johnson said it\u2019s a David versus Goliath-type competition. He said he believes Sheehy is getting party support for one reason .\n\n\u201cIt had nothing to do with policy, or experience, or electability \u2013 it had to do with money. And that to me is at the root of the problem we have with the system today,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nDespite Sheehy\u2019s ability to contribute some of his own wealth to his campaign, Johnson is still optimistic.\n\n\u201cBut I think the people of Montana are going to see through that and I think when they understand the choice is between a Montanan with deep roots and real experience and a real commitment to this state and a newcomer who\u2019s decided he wants to start his political involvement at the top of the mountain \u2013 they\u2019re going to see the difference and I think we\u2019re going to prevail,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nRepublican Charles Walking Child, an environmental consultant in Helena, is also running in the primary and has yet to report any fundraising. Libertarian Sid Daoud is uncontested in his primary, guaranteeing his ticket to the general election in November.\n\nThose that advance to the general election will face the well financed incumbent. Sheehy is leading the GOP candidates in fundraising but is still being outraised by Tester by about five to one.\n\nThe race could determine just how far Montana\u2019s growing support for GOP candidates goes.",

        "text": "Chad: Political Transition Ends with D\u00e9by\u2019s Election\nClick to expand Image Chadian President Mahamat Idriss D\u00e9by campaigning as transition president at a rally in N'Djamena, Chad, on May 4, 2024. \u00a9 2024 JEROME FAVRE/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock\n\n(Nairobi) \u2013 The political transition in Chad ended with violence as at least 9, and possibly more, civilians were reported killed by celebratory gunfire from soldiers and civilians, Human Rights Watch said today. On May 9, 2024, the National Election Management Agency (Agence nationale de gestion des \u00e9lections, ANGE) announced that the interim president, Gen. Mahamat Idriss D\u00e9by, had won the May 6 election outright, citing provisional results. His main challenger, Prime Minister Succ\u00e8s Masra, declared himself the winner in a separate announcement on social media.\n\nThe run up to the election and the days around the vote were violent. On February 28, members of the security forces killed Yaya Dillo, the president of the Socialist Party Without Borders (Parti socialiste sans fronti\u00e8res, PSF) and a potential election opponent, during an attack on the party\u2019s headquarters in N\u2019Djamena, the country\u2019s capital. Human Rights Watch has called for an independent investigation into his killing. On the day of the vote, violence broke out in the southern city of Moundou and a man attempting to vote was killed. After the results were announced, celebratory gunfire by security forces and civilians broke out across N\u2019Djamena, killing at least nine people according to local media reports.\n\n\u201cPresident D\u00e9by has consolidated his power as the transition period has now ended,\u201d said Lewis Mudge, Central Africa director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cAs the result has already been contested, an investigation into the violence before and after the vote should be paramount.\u201d\n\nThe election authorities announced that D\u00e9by won 61.03 percent of the vote, well over the 50 percent needed to avoid a runoff. The authorities announced that Masra won 18.53 percent.\n\nWhile international organizations, like the International Organization of la Francophonie (Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, OIF), made some attempts to observe the election, they did not have the capacity to systemically monitor the vote across the country. The interim government denied national civil society organizations funded by the European Union the accreditation to monitor the election. Masra has reported threats against him and his supporters since the vote.\n\nOn March 23, the civil society platform Wakit Tamma, which had been instrumental in leading pro-democracy protests, had called for a boycott describing the election as a \u201cmasquerade\u201d aimed to support a \u201cdynastic dictatorship.\u201d\n\nFormer President Idriss D\u00e9by died in April 2021 in fighting with an armed group, and the military gave power to his son, Mahamat Idriss D\u00e9by, in a transition that violated the constitution. Mahamat D\u00e9by\u2019s government violently suppressed continuing protests demanding a return to civilian rule, culminating in a bloody crackdown on October 20, 2022. On that day, thousands took to the streets in N\u2019Djamena and several other towns in southern Chad, including Moundou, Doba, and Sarh, to protest the transitional government\u2019s decision to extend a transition period. The constitution was replaced in a referendum in December 2023 by a new one enabling Mahamat Idriss D\u00e9by to run for president.\n\nIn the months leading up to the vote, the political space tightened for Masra\u2019s party Les Transformateurs (The Transformers, in English). Despite an arrest warrant issued for Masra, he was named prime minister in January as part of a political deal.\n\nDillo, the president of the Socialist Party Without Borders, was considered D\u00e9by\u2019s leading political opponent. The two men are reported to be cousins from the same Zaghawa ethnic group. Dillo had been widely reported to be preparing to run for president though he had not announced his intention. An independent investigation into Dillo\u2019s death should be a priority for the D\u00e9by government, Human Rights Watch said.\n\nClick to expand Image Identity card of Enock Neratar. \u00a9 2024 Private\n\nOn election day, a group of men tried to access a polling place in Moundou. When they failed to produce identification cards the men were asked to leave the center. A witness told Human Rights Watch that the men then started shooting in the area around the polling site. \u201cIt was chaos, and a man was hit,\u201d the witness said. \u201cThe military and the gendarmes came, but by then the attackers had left and the officials said they did not have any idea as to whom they may be.\u201d The victim, Enock Neratar, was shot in the stomach while waiting to vote and died on the spot. He was buried on May 9.\n\nWhile the ANGE, the national election body, had an additional 12 days to announce results, it released the provisional tally on May 9. In his speech on social media just before the results were announced, Masra claimed victory and called on security forces and his supporters to oppose what he deemed an attempt to steal the vote. To the Chadian people he said, \u201cDon\u2019t let your destiny be stolen,\u201d however, Masra reiterated that any mobilization should be \u201cwith a spirit of peace.\u201d\n\nHuman Rights Watch reviewed multiple videos and photos from N\u2019Djamena on May 9, which show large numbers of Chadian military taking up key positions across the city, and multiple videos of soldiers firing off their weapons to celebrate Mahamat D\u00e9by\u2019s victory. Local media reported that the shooting across the capital killed at least 9 civilians and wounded 60 others.\n\nSome of the shooting was concentrated in neighborhoods considered strongholds for Les Transformateurs party. \u201cThese shots are a threat to us, they are sending us a message: if you take to streets to protest, we will kill you,\u201d one member of the party told Human Rights Watch. On their Facebook page, Les Transformateursannounced that there was heavy firing outside of Masra\u2019s residence in Gassi neighborhood, 7th arrondissement, in a heavily populated neighborhood outside the city center.\n\n\u201cThe lead up to this election has been fraught with violence and civil society, journalists, and opponents fear that some Chadians, frustrated with the outcome of the election, may take to the streets,\u201d Mudge said. \u201cPresident D\u00e9by should instruct the security services unequivocally and publicly not to resort to violence against protesters, and warn them that those who do will be held accountable and met with severe sanctions.\u201d",

        "text": "Taiwan\u2019s Democracy Is Thriving in China\u2019s Shadow\nAmidst China\u2019s growing military, economic, and diplomatic pressure on Taiwan and the attendant rising awareness of the risk of a cross-strait conflict, Taiwan is often solely viewed as a flashpoint or the frontline in a geopolitical struggle between China and the United States. A 2021 cover of the Economist, for instance, went so far as to label Taiwan \u201cthe most dangerous place on earth.\u201d As international attention returns to Taiwan for its presidential inauguration on May 20, with keen interest in what president-elect William Lai will say on cross-strait relations, it is worth taking a step back to appreciate Taiwan\u2019s democratic achievements. Under four decades since martial law was lifted and under three decades after its first democratic presidential election, Taiwan has emerged as one of the world\u2019s strongest democracies, an achievement all the more remarkable considering the existential threat that the island faces.\n\nA Young but Strong Democracy\n\nIn 1979, when the United States terminated diplomatic relations with Taiwan (formally the Republic of China) and established formal ties with the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), it was trading one authoritarian regime for another. The Kuomintang (KMT) had imposed martial law on Taiwan in 1949, banned political opposition parties, and severely curtailed political rights.\n\nEventually, however, the ruling KMT, and above all President Chiang Ching-kuo, concluded that it needed to allow political pluralism. In one sense, this was a shrewd calculation for self-survival; Taiwan had lost its principal international backer, the United States, and the KMT\u2019s proposition that it would retake the mainland and that one-party rule was necessary in order to prepare for that day was impossible to maintain. Democratization, however, could help the KMT build a new foundation for its legitimacy among the populace. Chiang, also responding to growing pressure from below, thus set Taiwan on the path of a gradual and largely peaceful democratic transition. In 1986, an opposition party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), was founded and the following year martial law was lifted. In 1992, Taiwan held legislative elections, followed by its first presidential election in 1996 and its first peaceful transfer of power from one party to another four years later.\n\nAsia Unbound CFR fellows and other experts assess the latest issues emerging in Asia today. 1-3 times weekly.

Taiwan\u2019s elections are well-run, with voting done in-person (absentee voting is not allowed) and solely through paper ballots, each of which is read aloud and counted by election workers in the presence of observers after the polls close. The ballots are quickly tallied, and the winners are known within a few hours. In all of Taiwan\u2019s presidential elections, the losing party has conceded defeat and paved the way for a peaceful transfer of power. Civil liberties, from freedom of expression to freedom of religion and freedom of the press, are protected.\n\nReflecting these developments, Freedom House gives Taiwan a global freedom score of 94/100, placing it as the second-freest place in Asia behind Japan and the 22nd globally (far ahead of the United States). Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) ranks Taiwan 31st globally on its Liberal Democracy Index, one spot below Japan. The Human Freedom Index, which combines measures of personal, civil, and economic freedom, now ranks Taiwan twelfth in the world and first in Asia. The Economist Intelligence Unit\u2019s Democracy Index places Taiwan tenth in the world.\n\nBucking Democratic Backsliding\n\nTaiwan\u2019s democratic strength and resilience are even more impressive when set against the backdrop of a deterioration in freedom around the world. Global freedom has declined for 18 consecutive years, according to Freedom House, with 52 countries suffering declines over the past year. Taiwan, by contrast, last saw its score dip in 2011, has been repeatedly upgraded over the past decade-plus (from 87 in 2011 to 94 in 2024), and its overall score has never been higher. In its most recent report, V-Dem warned that \u201cautocratization continues to be a dominant trend\u201d and \u201cthe level of democracy enjoyed by the average person in the world in 2023 is down to 1985-levels.\u201d While \u201calmost all components of democracy are getting worse in more countries than they are getting better, compared to ten years ago,\u201d according to the report, Taiwan\u2019s score is higher than it was a decade ago. Finally, as recently as 2015 the Economist Intelligence Unit labeled Taiwan as a \u201cflawed democracy,\u201d but in the years since Taiwan has improved to become a \u201cfull democracy.\u201d\n\nIndeed, as the Hoover Institution\u2019s Kharis Templeman has written, Taiwan has made notable progress in addressing five areas where it had relative democratic weakness, namely political corruption, rule of law, political polarization, institutional defects, and mass values. Taiwan\u2019s democracy today is arguably stronger today than it has ever been.\n\nDemocracy has become a core component of national identity and is firmly embedded within society. Reflecting this, since Taiwan\u2019s first presidential election in 1996, the share of those in Taiwan who self-identify as \u201cTaiwanese\u201d (as opposed to \u201cChinese\u201d or \u201cboth Taiwanese and Chinese\u201d) has risen from under 25 percent to over 60 percent. The rise of Taiwanese identity, which paralleled Taiwan\u2019s democratization, demonstrates that being \u201cTaiwanese\u201d is rooted more in an appreciation of its political system than in perceived ethnocultural differences from China. Indeed, some scholars have conducted other polling and argued that \u201crejecting the PRC as a political system is a central part of Taiwanese identity.\u201d\n\nBut Challenges Remain\n\nWhile Taiwan\u2019s democracy is strong and resilient, challenges remain. Many of the issues that Taiwan has found difficult to tackle would sound familiar to most industrialized democracies, including stagnating wages and sluggish economic growth, rising housing costs, and high youth unemployment. If Taiwan\u2019s government is unable to address these concerns, which were at the top of mind for voters during the recent elections, its people could come to associate democracy with stagnation and gridlock.\n\nAnother issue, which is to some extent inherent on an island whose very existence is threatened, is polarization. Taiwan\u2019s two principal political parties, the KMT and DPP, have traditionally had widely divergent visions of the island\u2019s future and its relationship to China. The media ecosystem reflects this division, with partisan newspapers and television channels. As a result, according to a 2022 Reuters Institute survey, only 27 percent of Taiwanese respondents trust most news media most of the time, ranking it last in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nThere are, however, some signs that polarization is declining. The DPP and KMT have converged in practice on their approach to cross-strait relations, with both seeking to maintain the status quo. Rather than seeking de jure independence, the DPP now asserts that \u201cTaiwan is an independent sovereign nation, and its name is the Republic of China\u201d and as a result, a declaration of independence is unnecessary. The KMT, for its part, has rejected \u201cone country, two systems,\u201d while its presidential candidate pledged that \u201cTaiwan\u2019s future will be determined only by its own people\u201d and acknowledged that \u201cthe majority of people in Taiwan want to maintain this status quo.\u201d During the most recent election cycle, for the first time ever all the presidential candidates were \u201cnative\u201d Taiwanese, demonstrating that the traditional cleavage between mainlander and \u201cnative\u201d Taiwanese has largely faded. These shifts among the major political parties reflect where voter preferences have moved, with a plurality of Taiwanese wanting to maintain the status quo indefinitely.\n\nA growing threat to Taiwan\u2019s democracy is PRC-sponsored cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns designed to sway the result of elections, sow divisions in Taiwanese society, and cast doubts on the reliability of the United States. Indeed, Taiwan is the target of more disinformation from abroad than any other democracy. In the months leading to Taiwan\u2019s 2024 elections, distributed denial-of-service attacks on Taiwan grew by 3,370 percent compared to the previous year. The day prior to Taiwan\u2019s elections, there was a significant spike in malicious cyber activity targeting the island.\n\nIn addition to cyber-attacks, China has employed increasingly sophisticated disinformation campaigns, which Taiwan is particularly vulnerable to because most voters get their news from social media platforms, from Facebook to TikTok and YouTube. PRC disinformation campaigns are commonly designed to sow skepticism of the United States, employing narratives that the United States is unreliable, will sell out Taiwan, and is only interested in Taiwan insofar as it can be used to weaken China. Thus, a September 2023 poll found that only 34 percent of Taiwanese people found the United States to be a trustworthy country. China also seeks to undermine trust among Taiwanese in their democracy by amplifying allegations of corruption.\n\nTaiwanese civil society organizations have attempted to counter such efforts by employing fact-checking groups to quickly debunk false stories and proposing regulatory changes aimed at minimizing their deleterious effects. In one notable instance, a fact-checking organization squashed widespread rumors amplified by Chinese disinformation campaigns that claimed Taiwan was responding to an egg shortage by importing artificial eggs from China.\n\nResponding effectively, though, will likely prove increasingly difficult as the emergence of generative artificial intelligence will allow China to make more believable \u201cdeep fakes.\u201d Moreover, the sheer scale of Chinese disinformation campaigns has proven daunting. Finally, it is difficult to distinguish between a PRC-sponsored disinformation campaign and a legitimate grievance or opinion and to take steps to respond to the former while ensuring that political freedoms are not circumscribed.\n\nOver the past four decades, Taiwan has transformed from an authoritarian regime to one of the world\u2019s strongest and most resilient democracies. That it has done so while facing an existential threat from China and amidst broad international isolation makes its accomplishments all the more remarkable. Taiwan must now contend with growing Chinese disinformation and electoral interference campaigns and domestic political polarization, among other issues. As international attention turns to yet another peaceful transfer of power on Taiwan, observers should take stock not only of the outlook for cross-strait relations but also the island\u2019s democratic achievements.\n\nThis publication is part of the Diamonstein-Spielvogel Project on the Future of Democracy.",

Notably, this poll marks a significant boost for Trump since the 2023 year-end edition, in which he trailed by double-digit margins among Gen Z.\n\nPlus, Biden has a growing problem with us.\n\nBiden losing Gen Z?:Why are Gen Z voters souring on Biden? I decided to ask them about that frustration.\n\nMany in Gen Z have fully drank the Kool-Aid on the anti-Israel movement. Biden\u2019s supposed \u201cunwavering\u201d support for Israel amid its war against Hamas terrorists in Gaza poses a unique problem for him.\n\nGen Z is the most anti-Israel generation in our country, with 49% believing there is a genocide happening in Gaza, and 28% supporting an immediate cease-fire, more than any other generation for each category.\n\nInterestingly, Gen Z has apparently begun trust Trump more than Biden on the handling of the conflict in the Middle East (although \u201cneither\u201d is the far and away leader in that polling), despite the fact that Trump has said that Israel must \u201cfinish what they started.\u201d\n\nAnother glaring issue for Biden is the economy and inflation, an issue that is repeatedly listed as the No. 1 issue for Gen Z in polling, an issue that Gen Z trusts Trump with.\n\nWhile the inflation rate has fallen in recent months, Biden still shoulders the blame for prices being higher than they were four years ago.\n\nGen Z is left without direction from political leaders\n\nWhen candidates\u2019 personalities are a bigger issue than their policy, and when trust on major issues is split between the two parties, Gen Z is left without direction. We are politically homeless, with conservative youth pushing the party further toward populism and liberal youth pushing further toward a systematic \u201crevolution.\u201d We recognize the need for change, but the two parties are pushing us further away from their target base with their own decision-making.\n\nThe good news for both Democrats and Republicans is that our vote remains up for grabs. The bad news for Americans is that they are realizing this and turning into full-fledged pandering machines to harness our vote.\n\nBiden has chosen to uproot our nation's entire foreign policy for the sake of appeasing a bunch of bratty Columbia undergrads, whereas Trump has softened his ever-changing position on abortion because protecting life \u201cdoesn\u2019t poll well.\u201d\n\nI'm a young conservative:Republicans can't follow Trump's lead on abortion. He flip-flops too much.\n\nDespite these sudden radical actions from candidates, I don\u2019t see it being enough for Gen Z to overwhelmingly come to the support of either candidate. Our concerns about either candidate are unlikely to be overcome at this point in an election cycle, and our somberness about another election between two men born in the 1940s is likely to be loud in November.\n\nYounger voters are rapidly becoming America's largest voting bloc, with the power to influence elections at the national scale. For 2024, however, we're being asked to choose between Trump or Biden, and many will opt to not make a choice at all.\n\nIt's frustrating for my generation to have such an influential and involved voice but a lack of quality candidates.\n\nDace Potas is an Opinion fellow for USA TODAY.

        "text": "Renew Your DACA as Early as Possible\nOn May 13, 2024, the Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman (CIS Ombudsman) sent out this stakeholder message:\n\nIf you need to renew your Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), the Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman (CIS Ombudsman) encourages you to file your DACA renewal request as early as possible.\n\nUSCIS recommends you submit your DACA renewal request 150 to 120 days (four to five months) before the expiration date on your current DACA approval notice (Form I-797, Notice of Action) and employment authorization document (EAD). Filing your renewal request during this timeframe reduces the risk that your current DACA and employment authorization will expire before USCIS makes a decision on your renewal request. Filing earlier than 150 days before your current DACA expiration will not result in a faster decision.\n\non your current DACA approval notice (Form I-797, Notice of Action) and employment authorization document (EAD).\n\nFile your renewal request online. Filing online allows you to track your case, respond to requests for evidence electronically, and communicate with USCIS through your online account. It may also save you money.\n\n\n\nMake sure your request is complete. Before submitting your request: If you are submitting a paper form, make sure you use the most recent versions of Form I-821D, Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization and the Form I-765 Worksheet. A new edition of Form I-765 went into effect on April 1, 2024. Review all the forms to ensure that you have signed them. Confirm you are paying the appropriate fees. As of April 1, 2024, the Form I-765 filing fee increased to $520 if you file the paper form and $470 if you file online. The Form I-821D filing fee will remain $85. If filing a paper form, include separate checks or money orders for the Form I-765 and Form I-821D filing fees.\n\nBefore submitting your request:\n\nCheck USCIS\u2019 processing times. Please visit USCIS\u2019 Check Case Processing Times page to check its processing times for Form I-821D and Form I-765. Remember, USCIS will not adjudicate your DACA-based Form I-765 until after it makes a decision on your Form I-821D DACA renewal request.\n\nPlease visit USCIS\u2019 Check Case Processing Times page to check its processing times for Form I-821D and Form I-765.\n\nYou may request an expedite of your DACA renewal request in emergencies or unforeseen circumstances. Please see USCIS\u2019 Immigration Relief in Emergencies or Unforeseen Circumstances page.\n\nWhy this matters\n\nDACA renewals and the associated EAD renewals represent a sizeable workload for USCIS. Filing within the recommended timeframe reduces the risk that your current period of DACA and employment authorization will expire before you receive a decision on your renewal request.\n\nIf you file more than one year after your current DACA expires, USCIS considers it an initial request and not a renewal. While USCIS is accepting initial DACA requests, recent court rulings prohibit USCIS from approving them at this time. Therefore, you may submit an initial request by mail, but all initial DACA requests are on hold and USCIS will not adjudicate them at this time.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more information on DACA, go to USCIS\u2019 Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Frequently Asked Questions pages. For information about current court cases affecting DACA, go to the agency\u2019s DACA Litigation Information page.\n\nThe CIS Ombudsman is committed to working with stakeholders and USCIS to address concerns related to DACA. We will share additional updates on this topic when available.",

        "text": "5 reasons why Nevada may decide the 2024 presidential race\nHow Nevada votes could decide who the next president is. Its history as a swing state goes way back, arguably since its statehood.\n\nAll eyes will be on Nevada in November as a swing state likely to determine who will be the next president. After all, the Silver State has a long-standing reputation for picking the candidate who will head to the White House.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to think of a place where an individual vote is more valuable than Nevada,\u201d said David Wasserman, senior editor and elections analyst for The Cook Political Report. It is hosting a competitive presidential race, and it also has competitive congressional races, he said.\n\nBut why is Nevada a swing state? How did it get there? And why does it matter?\n\n1. We have a long history.\n\nNevada began as a swing state, at least in the mind of Abraham Lincoln, according to Michael Green, a history professor at UNLV.\n\nIt received statehood in 1864 because Lincoln was concerned about his reelection, Green said. The Constitution of Nevada was telegraphed to Congress days before the presidential election to help ensure he had three more electoral votes. The contribution ended up being minimal; Lincoln ended up winning his reelection 212 to 21.\n\nFor years, politicians have looked to Nevada, and even specific counties, as a bellwether for what is to come.\n\nDuring the 1960 election cycle, John F. Kennedy called Nevada lawyer Ralph Denton, who co-chaired the Kennedy-Johnson campaign for Nevada, and asked, \u201chow is Esmeralda County going to vote?\u201d according to Green. At the time, Esmeralda County had picked the winning candidate in every presidential election that century, Green said.\n\nNevada\u2019s more recent reputation as a swing state in modern politics really began when the population of the state began rapidly increasing around the 1980s, according to Rebecca Gill, a political science professor at UNLV who co-wrote the Nevada chapter of the 2022 book \u201cPresidential Swing States.\u201d\n\n2. We consistently pick the winner. Usually.\n\nSwing states tend to be bellwethers. If a candidate wins that state, that should be a good predictor that the candidate is going to win the presidential election, according to David Schultz, a political science professor at Hamline University in St. Paul, Minnesota.\n\nFrom 1912 and until now, on only two occasions have Nevada\u2019s electoral votes not gone to the person who became president, according to Green. One was Gerald Ford, who lost to Jimmy Carter in 1976, and the other was Hillary Clinton, who lost to Donald Trump in 2016, according to Green.\n\n\u201cSo we have had quite a streak going,\u201d Green said.\n\nThe last time Nevada picked a Republican president was in 2004, but Democrats have been hanging on by a thread for the last several cycles, according to Wasserman. That is in part due to Democrats slipping with Hispanic and non-college white voters, Wasserman said.\n\nOne of the reasons why Democrats have been able to hold onto the Silver State is because of the heavy presence of organized labor relative to other states, he said.\n\n3. We have a balance of political parties and attitudes.\n\nSwing states usually have a large percentage of independent voters, closely matched candidates and competitive races coming down to five percentage points or less, according to Schultz. Swing states also tend to have both Democratic and Republican strongholds.\n\nNevada fits that mold. Nonpartisan voters make up around 34 percent of the state\u2019s registered voters, with Democrats at 30 percent and Republicans at 29 percent, according to the secretary of state\u2019s office. Areas like Clark County and Washoe have a strong Democratic base, while Nevada\u2019s more rural areas tend to favor Republicans.\n\nThe Silver State\u2019s races also are consistently close. In 2022, Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto won her re-election by just 0.81 of a percentage point. In recent presidential elections, the winner walked out receiving just two or three percentage points more than the loser.\n\nElections in a swing state like Nevada come down to moving a small number of voters, Schultz said. Whichever side is more successful at moving those voters ends up winning, he said.\n\n\u201cWe are still one of the major puzzle pieces for each side as they\u2019re trying to figure out how they\u2019re going to get to the magic number,\u201d Gill said.\n\n4. America is looking increasingly like us.\n\nNevada is a diverse state, and demographers anticipate the rest of the country\u2019s population will look more like Nevada over the course of the next couple of decades, Gill said. That makes Nevada a good indicator of how the rest of the country might be feeling.\n\nIf a candidate does well here, they could theoretically do well elsewhere in the country, Green said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like the song \u2018New York, New York.\u2019 If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere,\u201d Green said. \u201cIf you can navigate that we are a very diverse community, ethnically, religiously, economically, and do well here, you should be able to do well in some other places.\u201d\n\n5. It might come down to us on Election Day, and candidates know it.\n\nCandidates and political parties are aware of the influence swing states like Nevada will have on the 2024 election, and their pocketbooks and calendars reflect that. Surrogates and candidates flock to the Silver State during the election cycle, and Nevadans cannot avoid the onslaught of political advertisements leading up to Election Day.\n\nThe 2024 presidential election is expected to be the most expensive cycle in history, according to AdImpact.com, which projects $10.2 billion in political expenditures, $576 million of which is expected to be spent in Nevada.\n\nNevadans can expect to see the biggest names in the political sphere stop by in the next six months, from former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden, to perhaps well-known figures like Barack Obama. This year alone, Vice President Kamala Harris visited four times to bring attention to the Biden-Harris campaign.\n\nNevada only has six electoral college votes, far fewer than other states. But in presidential races that come down to just a few electoral college votes, Nevada matters.\n\nIn 2000, George W. Bush defeated Al Gore 271 to 266 Electoral College votes, but lost the popular vote by some 500,000. In Nevada, Bush received 49.49 percent of the vote, and Gore received 45.94 percent.\n\nIf the state is seen as \u201cgettable\u201d by the political parties, they will spend money targeting the voters in the state, Gill said.\n\n\u201cAs long as we continue to be relatively unpredictable, in terms of who we are throwing our electoral college vote behind, we will still be attracting national attention and spending from these national campaigns,\u201d Gill said. \u201cIt\u2019s only when states become predictable that they start losing the kind of attention from the national politicians.\u201d\n\nContact Jessica Hill at jehill@reviewjournal.com.

Mr. Biden led among registered voters in only one battleground state, Wisconsin.\n\n[You can find the full results of the polls, including the exact questions that were asked, here. You can see answers to common questions about our polling process here.]\n\nThe race was closer among likely voters. Mr. Trump led in five states as well, but Mr. Biden edged ahead in Michigan while trailing only narrowly in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.

In different surveys conducted by the ' New York Times ', Siena College and ' The Philadelphia Inquirer ', it has been found that former US President Donald Trump of the Republican Party is more popular than President Joe Biden in five swing states . This has been reported by the ' New York Post '.The survey has pointed out that Trump is more popular than Joe Biden in Michigan , Arizona, Nevada, Georgia and Pennsylvania while Biden was leading in Wisconsin. All these six states are popularly referred to as the \u2018swing states\u2019. Biden won all these six states in the 2020 US Presidential Elections. Analysts have pointed out that Biden can emerge victorious in the upcoming elections if he wins Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin without losing any of the states he had won in 2020.In recent times, the issues about the economy and cost of living, immigration and the ongoing Israel-Hamas war have emerged as key issues.70% of the voters wanted an overhaul of the economy and political system with only 13% expressing confidence in Biden\u2019s abilities. Over 40% of Trump\u2019s supporters said the economy and cost of living were the most important issues and doubted Biden\u2019s claim of having improved the economy.Those in the 18-29 age group and who are Hispanic, equally support Biden and Trump and over 60% of those in this group had earlier supported Biden in 2020. Amongst the Blacks, over 20% supported Trump which is presently the highest for any Republican candidate from this ethnic group since 1964, according to Times Poll Among the traditional White voters, Biden has emerged more popular. This segment seeks to maintain a status quo.Another key issue is that of abortion which has traditionally been an important electoral issue. Over 64% of those polled believed that it should continue to be legal. 13% of Biden\u2019s voters in 2020 stated that they would not be voting for him due to foreign policy \u2018failures\u2019, especially the handling of the Gaza war. Over 17% of them supported Israel.These polls surveyed 4097 registered voters in the six states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin from April 28 to May 9.Traditionally, while some states support either the Democrats or the Republicans, some states can swing in either way. It is here that the candidates sweat it out and the results are too close to call.November 5, 2024 , is the date when the US will vote for its new presidential candidate. The new president will take the oath of office in early 2025 for 4 years.",

        "summary": " William Lai will be inaugurated as Taiwan\u2019s next president on May 20 . Lai is not a wild-eyed zealot with a one-track-minded focus on Taiwan independence . He will benefit by showing steadiness and the capacity to garner greater global support for Taiwan's security .",
        "text": "Beware forecasts of doom for Taiwan under Lai\nThe Taiwan people elected Lai with a weak mandate. He garnered 40% of the popular vote, in contrast to the 56% and 57% that his predecessor gained in the 2016 and 2020 elections, respectively. If not for the fact that Taiwan\u2019s 2024 presidential election was a contested three-way race, Lai may not have prevailed. Lai\u2019s political party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), lost the Legislative Yuan. Its main rival, the Kuomintang (KMT), secured the most legislative seats, albeit short of an absolute majority.\n\nSuch analysis is easy to write and almost certainly wrong. Lai is not a wild-eyed zealot with a one-track-minded focus on Taiwan independence. He is a professional politician who has organized his career around becoming Taiwan\u2019s president. Now that he has ascended to Taiwan\u2019s top elected position, he will want to win reelection. To do so, he almost certainly will need to tack to the center of Taiwan\u2019s political spectrum rather than cater to the wishes of a small minority of Taiwan voters who favor throwing caution to the wind in service of Taiwan independence or unification. Indeed, less than 6 percent of Taiwan\u2019s voters support \u201cthe immediate pursuit of independence from, or unification with, the People\u2019s Republic of China.\u201d\n\nAs the May 20 inauguration of William Lai as Taiwan\u2019s next president approaches, prepare for an anticipable wave of news analyses predicting escalating tensions and potential conflict on the horizon. Lai famously referred to himself as a \u201cpragmatic worker for Taiwan independence.\u201d And since Beijing has threatened to go to war to prevent Taiwan independence, so the thinking goes, Lai\u2019s inauguration could spell impending trouble.\n\nImportantly, President-elect Lai lost a significant share of Taiwan\u2019s youth vote. Even though Lai himself is young and charismatic, he represented continuity in the eyes of many Taiwan youth voters who had grown disillusioned during the past eight years of DPP rule. Many Taiwan youth feel crushed by the weight of limited job opportunities, out-of-reach housing costs, and grim prospects for their future. For these young voters who will be increasingly decisive to the outcome of Taiwan\u2019s next presidential election, \u201cmore of the same\u201d is not an appealing proposition.\n\nThus, Lai\u2019s principal task over the next four years will be to improve living conditions and life prospects for Taiwan\u2019s rising generation of voters. To do so, Lai will need to drive social and economic reforms through Taiwan\u2019s divided legislature. He also will need to make progress in addressing Taiwan\u2019s energy challenges and bolstering Taiwan\u2019s technology sector in an increasingly competitive global marketplace. This will be his best\u2014and perhaps only\u2014path to reelection.\n\nThe other key question voters will ask in their next election is who would keep Taiwan safe in the face of China\u2019s growing threat. Taiwan\u2019s voters are aware of rising security risks in the Taiwan Strait, but they are not panicking. Lai will want to keep it that way. He will benefit by showing steadiness and the capacity to garner greater global support for Taiwan\u2019s security. This is what Taiwan\u2019s voters want. Over 80% of Taiwan\u2019s voters favor preserving the status quo with China.\n\nLai\u2019s presumptive political rivals in the next presidential election will argue that they represent a safer set of hands for managing cross-Strait tensions. Beijing also will have incentive to augment their arguments. Beijing would prefer for Lai and his political party to lose the next election in 2028; Chinese leaders judge that Lai and his political party do not present an opportunity to draw cross-Strait relations closer and pull Taiwan toward unification with China. China\u2019s leaders certainly recognize that the more Lai becomes perceived as reckless and dangerous, the less likely he will be able to hold on to power in the future. Beijing can reliably be expected to try to paint Lai as pushing Taiwan dangerously close to the brink of war.\n\nBeware of accepting Beijing\u2019s propaganda as reality, though. In reality, Lai has pledged continuity of policy on cross-Strait relations with Taiwan\u2019s outgoing president, Tsai Ing-wen. Tsai is widely credited internationally for charting a principled, steady, pragmatic course on cross-Strait relations. Indeed, these attributes were definitional to Tsai\u2019s success in attracting greater global support for maintaining cross-Strait peace and stability.\n\nLai has kept nearly all of Tsai\u2019s closest advisors on in his administration. Tsai\u2019s foreign minister, Joseph Wu, will serve as secretary-general of Taiwan\u2019s National Security Council (NSC). Tsai\u2019s NSC secretary-general, Wellington Koo, will become minister of national defense. Tsai\u2019s former trusted envoy to the United States, Bi-Khim Hsiao, has been elected vice president. Taiwan\u2019s current representative in Washington, Alexander Yui, is a highly respected career diplomat who will remain in place to provide continuity. In other words, Taiwan\u2019s senior-most officials in Lai\u2019s administration are experienced and know how to manage the situation.\n\nTo be sure, Beijing will make life difficult for Lai. China\u2019s leaders do not want Lai to succeed. They will look for opportunities to drive wedges between Taiwan and its key partners, including the United States, Japan, Australia, India, and European powers. Beijing will want to scare Washington and others into thinking that Lai\u2019s statements and actions are evidence of his underlying ambition to pursue de jure independence. They will seek to apply pressure on the United States to \u201crein in\u201d Lai, lest there be conflict in the Taiwan Strait.\n\nBeijing also will seek to sow divisions within Taiwan, including by propping up Lai\u2019s political rivals while undermining Lai. Beijing will use incidents as opportunities to ratchet up military pressure around Taiwan, just as they did after then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi\u2019s August 2022 visit to Taiwan. Beijing\u2019s use of incidents to create new conditions around Taiwan will be a central feature of China\u2019s approach over the coming years. It allows China\u2019s leaders to foster an image of directional progress in shrinking Taiwan\u2019s space for operating independent of Beijing\u2019s preferences.\n\nChina likely also will increase military pressure on Taiwan in the coming years. China clearly is investing significant resources in military options for resolving cross-Strait differences. China\u2019s expanding military capabilities will be felt most acutely in Taiwan. Even so, the United States government continues to assess that conflict in the Taiwan Strait is \u201cneither imminent nor inevitable.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Lai inherits a serious set of challenges. He will need to govern with discretion and finesse, rather than bold strokes, if he wants to advance an ambitious domestic agenda and continue attracting global support for Taiwan\u2019s security. Based on my own experiences with Lai dating back to his time as mayor of Tainan, I am confident he understands this reality.\n\nSome analysts will draw analogies between Lai and disgraced former president Chen Shui-bian. Like Lai, former president Chen vowed steadiness in his approach to governance. Chen also confronted a divided legislature and a recalcitrant Beijing. After two years of being stonewalled in his efforts to govern from the middle, Chen pivoted to stoking Taiwan nationalism and catering to his \u201cdeep Green\u201d base of supporters to get reelected president in 2004. Although politically expedient for Chen, the episode was deeply damaging for Taiwan\u2019s security. Chen\u2019s persistent prodding forced Washington to publicly articulate the limits of its support for Taiwan and its security.\n\nLai knows this history and has shown no interest in repeating it. China\u2019s military strength is far greater today than it was during Chen\u2019s tenure. And Washington\u2019s willingness to articulate limits in its support for partners who exhibit disregard for American security interests is real.\n\nLai deserves to be judged on his own merits with an open mind. He will make mistakes. All leaders do. But Lai is not the caricature that Beijing wants to create of him. This bears reminding as Lai\u2019s inauguration approaches on May 20.",

Some districts, including Montgomery County, will host local races that do not require political affiliation to participate.\n\nYou can look up your voting location on the Maryland State Board of Elections website.\n\nWhat to know about early voting\n\nIn-person early voting for the primary election has now ended. It ran from Thursday, May 2, through Thursday, May 9.\n\nMore information on early voting can be found on the Maryland State Board of Elections website.\n\nWhat\u2019s on the ballot?\n\nVoters in Maryland will be asked to weigh in on a slew of local races, and there are some extremely competitive contests.\n\nSenate\n\nThe retirement of longtime Sen. Ben Cardin has touched off a competitive and crowded race to succeed him.\n\nOn the Democratic side, a total of 10 candidates are vying for the seat. Prince George\u2019s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks and U.S. Rep. David Trone are seen as the leading contenders.\n\nTrone, the multimillionaire co-owner of Total & Wine who has held his congressional seat in the 6th District since 2019, has poured millions into his Senate campaign.\n\nAlsobrooks, the two-term executive of Prince George\u2019s County \u2014 Maryland\u2019s second largest county \u2014 has won the endorsement of most major Democratic officeholders in the state, including Gov. Wes Moore, Rep. Steny Hoyer and others.\n\nAlsobrooks would be only the third Black woman elected to the U.S. Senate if she were to win the general election.\n\nOne recent poll indicated the race may be tightening amid questions about which candidate is best poised to take on former Republican Gov. Larry Hogan in the fall, and prevent Republicans from winning control of the Senate.\n\nFull list of Democratic candidates\n\nAngela Alsobrooks\n\nMichael W. Cobb, Sr.\n\nMarcellus Crews\n\nBrian E. Frydenborg\n\nScottie J. Griffin\n\nRobert K. Houton\n\nJoseph Perez\n\nSteven Henry Seuferer\n\nDavid J. Trone\n\nAndrew Jaye Wildman\n\nOn the Republican side, there are a total of five candidates, including Hogan, who jolted the race when he announced his candidacy earlier this year.\n\nHogan, who left the Maryland governor\u2019s mansion in January 2023 with sky-high popularity ratings, was a popular GOP figure in a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans 2 to 1.\n\nHowever, he has been criticized by some in his own party for his anti-Trump stance.\n\nFull list of Republican candidates:\n\nMoe H. Barakat\n\nChris Chaffee\n\nRobin Ficker\n\nLorie R. Friend\n\nLarry Hogan\n\nJohn A. Myrick\n\nLaban Y.

Trone, who was reelected in 2022 by a comfortable margin, is giving up the seat to make his Senate run.\n\nA contentious redistricting process has made it potentially more promising ground for Republicans.\n\nUnder the current borders, the district includes all of Allegany, Frederick, Garrett and Washington counties, and a portion of Montgomery County.\n\nOn the Democratic side, there are a whopping 16 candidates running, including a number of state lawmakers.\n\nApril McClain Delaney, a former U.S. Commerce Department official \u2014 whose husband, John Delaney, held the seat before Trone \u2014 \u201cis probably the nominal front-runner,\u201d according to Kurtz, with Maryland Matters.\n\nShe has been endorsed by Rep. Jamie Raskin, who represents the 8th District.\n\nBut she is facing an aggressive challenge by State Del. Joe Vogel, 27, who would be one of the few members of Generation Z elected to Congress were he to win. Vogel also has support from unions and activist groups\n\nFull list of Democratic candidates\n\nPeter Choharis\n\nGeorge Gluck\n\nGeoffrey Grammer\n\nAshwani Jain\n\nLesley J. Lopez\n\nTekesha A.

It was not a \u201crazor-thin margin.\u201d Trone won by more than 9.5%.\n\nThis report also previously stated that one must be registered with either the Republican or Democratic parties to participate in Maryland\u2019s primary. However, some districts will host local races that do not require political affiliation.\n\nThis story has been corrected and updated.\n\nGet breaking news and daily headlines delivered to your email inbox by signing up here.\n\n\u00a9 2024 WTOP.

        "text": "WATCH: Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s appearance at Trump\u2019s felony trial marks a remarkable moment in US politics\nU.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson assailed the U.S. judicial system on Tuesday, becoming the highest-ranking Republican to attend court with Donald Trump and using his powerful position to attack the case against the former president as an illegitimate \u201csham.\u201d\n\nWatch Johnson\u2019s remarks in the player above.\n\nIt was a remarkable moment in modern American politics: The House speaker turning his Republican Party against the federal and state legal systems that are foundational to the U.S. government and a cornerstone of democracy.\n\nJohnson, who is second in line for the presidency, called the court system \u201ccorrupt.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not about justice,\u201d Johnson declared, standing in a park outside the New York courthouse. \u201cIt is about politics.\u201d\n\nThe speaker is leading a growing list of Republican lawmakers who are criticizing the American judicial system as they rally to Trump\u2019s side, appearing at the courthouse to defend the party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee. Trump is accused of having arranged secret payments to a porn actress to hide negative stories during his successful 2016 campaign for president.\n\nWith Trump stuck in court and barred by a judge\u2019s gag order from criticizing witnesses or certain elements of the case, Johnson and the lawmakers are taking it upon themselves to attack the proceedings, now in a fourth week of witness testimony. They\u2019re using the trial as a de facto campaign stop as they work to return the former president to the White House.\n\nIn portraying the case against Trump as politically motivated, the Republicans are also laying the groundwork to dismiss its significance, should the jury convict, and for potential challenges to the fall election, a rematch with President Joe Biden, a Democrat.\n\nWATCH: Tamara Keith and Amy Walter on polls showing Biden trailing Trump in key states\n\nJohnson was a chief architect of Trump\u2019s efforts to challenge the 2020 presidential results ahead of the Jan. 6, 2021, mob assault on the U.S. Capitol, and last week he called the hush money trial and the other election-year cases against Trump a \u201cborderline criminal conspiracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is election interference,\u201d Johnson said Tuesday. \u201cAnd the American people are not going to let this stand.\u201d\n\nAlso with him on Tuesday were U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum \u2014 both considered possible vice presidential candidates \u2014 as well as former GOP candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, one of Trump\u2019s current top surrogates.\n\nU.S. Sens. JD Vance of Ohio and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama were among those who attended court on Monday.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign has lined up allies in recent days to appear at the New York courthouse to attack witnesses and others whom Trump is barred by a judge\u2019s gag order from criticizing himself.\n\nSen. Rick Scott of Florida said Monday that he appeared last week at the invitation of Trump senior advisor Susie Wiles. The campaign has said others volunteered to come to New York.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats are using the court system to go after and prosecute, criminally, a political opponent \u2014 that\u2019s a crime,\u201d Scott said over the weekend on Fox News. \u201cThey\u2019re just thugs trying to stop Trump from being able to run for president.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Speaker Johnson holds news conference on anti-Israel protests and universities\n\nIn the short term, the Republicans\u2019 presence at the courthouse and comments critical of the process have let Trump and his allies amplify their message without risking another explicit violation of the gag order.\n\nJohnson specifically attacked the credibility of Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former lawyer and fixer who began his second day of testimony in the former president\u2019s hush money trial. And others, too.\n\nHe assailed Cohen as \u201ca man who is clearly on a mission for personal revenge,\u201d said lead prosecutor Matthew Colangelo \u201crecently received over $10,000 in payments from the Democratic National Committee\u201d and said the daughter of Judge Juan M. Merchan has made \u201cmillions of dollars\u201d doing online fundraising for Democrats.\n\nThe Republican speaker, who is wholly dependent on support from Trump to keep the gavel, has aimed to strengthen their alliance, particularly as Johnson has come under fire from his own caucus in the House, including a failed effort at his removal by a fellow Trump backer, U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia.\n\nJohnson made an appearance with the former president at his Mar-a-Lago club last month to announce new House legislation to require proof of citizenship for voting, echoing Trump\u2019s baseless claims that Democrats are abetting immigrants entering the U.S. illegally to swing elections \u2014 another potential route for Republican challenges to the 2024 election.\n\nThere isn\u2019t any indication that noncitizens vote in significant numbers in federal elections or that they will in the future.\n\nAnd Johnson joined Trump on stage for the Republican National Committee\u2019s gala at Mar-a-Lago earlier this month, praising the presumptive presidential nominee and saying House Republicans fully expect to ride Trump\u2019s coattails to their own re-elections to keep the majority hold on the chamber.\n\nJohnson has been using the pulpit of the speaker\u2019s office in Washington to attack the U.S. judicial system, criticizing the courts as biased against the former president, claiming the case is politically motivated by Democrats and insisting Trump has done nothing wrong.\n\nThe speaker has demurred when asked if the 2020 election was legitimate, and in a departure from the tradition of trust and adherence in U.S. election systems, Johnson and other Republicans have hedged when asked if they will accept the election results of 2024.\n\nKinnard reported from Columbia, South Carolina.

Their actions and those of others disrupted a joint session of the U.S. Congress convened to ascertain and count the electoral votes related to the 2020 presidential election.\n\nJoseph Irwin, 43, of Cecilia, Kentucky, and John Joseph Richter, 39, of Port Charlotte, Florida, were found guilty in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia of multiple felony and misdemeanor offenses following a bench trial before U.S. District Court Judge Randolph D. Moss.\n\nIrwin was convicted of three felonies, including obstruction of an official proceeding, entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds with a deadly or dangerous weapon, and disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds with a deadly or dangerous weapon. In addition to the felonies, Irwin was convicted of misdemeanor offenses of entering and remaining on the floor of Congress, disorderly conduct in a Capitol building, and parading, demonstrating, or picketing in a Capitol building.\n\nRichter was convicted of the felony offense of obstruction of an official proceeding. In addition to the felonies, Richter was convicted of misdemeanor offenses of entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds, entering and remaining on the floor of Congress, disorderly conduct in a Capitol building, and parading, demonstrating, or picketing in a Capitol building.\n\nJudge Moss will sentence the men on Aug. 9, 2024.\n\nAccording to court documents, in the weeks and days leading to Jan. 6, 2021, the two planned to travel to Washington, D.C., on January 6th with the intent to obstruct the certification of the Electoral College vote. In one text message, Richter sent Irwin a photo discussing the Electoral College certification process on January 6 and former Vice President Mike Pence's role in the certification.\n\nAs the two men discussed their travel plans to Washington, D.C., they discussed the potential for violence and their roles.

In one message, Richter circulated a photo of a metal pointed flagpole he intended to bring to Washington, D.C. Richter explained that he would bring the all-black American flag because the \"All black flag means no quarter will be given. It's time to do patriot s\u2014.\" Irwin also discussed bringing a wooden pole that he inscribed with a black American flag; he said that his \"wooden stick is heavy as f\u2014.\"\n\nOn Jan. 6, 2021, the two men attended the \"Stop the Steal\" rally on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., and afterward marched to the U.S. Capitol building, carrying their previously discussed poles in hand. Richter carried a black American flag with a pointed metal tip, and Irwin carried a heavy wooden pole.\n\nAfter reaching the Capitol grounds, Irwin and Richter ascended to the Upper West Terrace and approached a group of police officers that had just arrived on Capitol grounds. Irwin approached the police officers while wielding his wooden pole at them. Irwin repeatedly yelled at the officers to \"Go Home!!\" and then aggressively smashed his pole on the ground in a threatening manner at the police officers, ultimately breaking his wooden pole into two pieces.\n\nNext, Irwin and Richter made their way to the Senate Wing Door. Richter disassembled his pole into two pieces and handed one piece of the pole\u2014with a metal tip\u2014to Irwin. From there, the two continued wielding their poles as they watched rioters break into the building and scream, \"LET US IN! LET US IN! LET US IN!\" Richter and Irwin watched as other rioters smashed the windows and broke into the Capitol through the Parliamentarian's Door. At approximately 2:43 p.m. \u2013 just minutes after the Parliamentarian's door had been violently breached \u2013 defendant Richter and Irwin entered the Capitol building, banging their poles on the ground.\n\nThe two men joined a mob of rioters that progressed through the Capitol and eventually made their way to the Senate Floor, where the former Vice President and members of Congress had not long before evacuated under an emergency order. As the rioters flooded onto the Senate Floor and rustled through the Vice President's desk, Irwin banged his flagpole on the ground and yelled at the top of his lungs, \"THIS IS OURS RIGHT HERE! THIS IS OUR HOUSE! THIS IS WHAT THE COURT DO WHEN THE COURT TAKE IT! DON'T GIVE IT BACK TO THEM NOW!\" While still on the Senate Floor, after cheering with other rioters in celebration of \"taking\" the chamber, the two men sat at Senators' desks and had their photograph taken by a fellow rioter while brandishing their poles.\n\nThe men left the Senate Chamber and the Capitol building only after Metropolitan Police Department Officers eventually directed them out. After their participation in the Capitol riot, the two continued to celebrate their success in halting the Congressional proceeding. Court documents say that Irwin framed the sharp wooden pole in a shadow box and referred to it as a \"Relic.\"\n\nThe FBI arrested Joseph Irwin on Aug. 17, 2021, in Cecilia, Kentucky, and John Richter on March 2, 2023, in Port Charlotte, Florida.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia and the Department of Justice National Security Division's Counterterrorism Section prosecuted this case. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Kentucky and the Middle District of Florida provided valuable assistance.\n\nThe FBI's Louisville, Tampa, and Washington Fields Offices investigated this case. The United States Capitol Police and the Metropolitan Police Department provided valuable assistance.\n\nIn the 40 months since Jan. 6, 2021, more than 1,424 individuals have been charged in nearly all 50 states for crimes related to the breach of the U.S. Capitol, including more than 500 individuals charged with assaulting or impeding law enforcement, a felony. The investigation remains ongoing.\n\nAnyone with tips can call 1-800-CALL-FBI (800-225-5324) or visit tips.fbi.gov.",

        "text": "Biden hikes tariffs on Chinese EVs, solar cells, steel, aluminum \u2014 and snipes at Trump\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden slapped major new tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, advanced batteries, solar cells, steel, aluminum and medical equipment on Tuesday, taking potshots at Donald Trump along the way as he embraced a strategy that\u2019s increasing friction between the world\u2019s two largest economies.\n\nThe Democratic president said that Chinese government subsidies ensure the nation\u2019s companies don\u2019t have to turn a profit, giving them an unfair advantage in global trade.\n\n\u201cAmerican workers can outwork and outcompete anyone as long as the competition is fair,\u201d Biden said in the White House Rose Garden. \u201cBut for too long, it hasn\u2019t been fair. For years, the Chinese government has poured state money into Chinese companies ... it\u2019s not competition, it\u2019s cheating.\u201d\n\nThe tariffs come in the middle of a heated campaign between Biden and Trump, his Republican predecessor, to show who\u2019s tougher on China. In a nod to the presidential campaign, Biden recognized lawmakers from Michigan in his remarks and spoke about workers in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, all battleground states in November\u2019s election.\n\nAsked to respond to Trump\u2019s comments that China was eating America\u2019s lunch, Biden said of his rival, \u201cHe\u2019s been feeding them a long time.\u201d The Democrat said Trump had failed to crack down on Chinese trade abuses as he had pledged he would do during his presidency.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the Trump campaign\u2019s press secretary, called the new tariffs a \u201cweak and futile attempt\u201d to distract from Biden\u2019s own support for EVs in the United States, which Trump says will lead to layoffs at auto factories.\n\nThe Chinese government was quick to push back against the tariffs, saying they \u201cwill seriously affect the atmosphere of bilateral cooperation.\u201d The foreign ministry used the word \u201cbullying.\u201d\n\nThe tariffs are unlikely to have a broad inflationary impact in the short term because of how they\u2019re structured, some not to take effect until 2026, but there could be price increases in the meantime for EV batteries, solar and some other specific items.\n\nBiden administration officials said they think the tariffs won\u2019t escalate tensions with China, yet they expect China will explore ways to respond to the new taxes on its products. It\u2019s uncertain what the long-term impact on prices could be if the tariffs contribute to a wider trade dispute.\n\nThe tariffs are to be phased in over the next three years, with those that take effect in 2024 covering EVs, solar cells, syringes, needles, steel and aluminum and more. There are currently very few EVs from China in the U.S., but officials worry low-priced models made possible by Chinese government subsidies could soon start flooding the U.S. market.\n\nChinese firms can sell EVs for as little as $12,000. China\u2019s solar cell plants and steel and aluminum mills have enough capacity to meet much of the world\u2019s demand, with Chinese officials arguing their production keeps prices low and would aid a transition to the green economy.\n\nChina\u2019s commerce ministry said in a statement that the tariffs were \u201ctypical political manipulation\u201d as it expressed its \u201cstrong dissatisfaction\u201d and pledged to \u201ctake resolute measures to defend its rights and interests.\u201d\n\nUnder the findings of a four-year review on trade with China, the tax rate on imported Chinese EVs will rise to 102.5% this year, up from total levels of 27.5%. The review was undertaken under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which allows the government to retaliate against trade practices deemed unfair or in violation of global standards.\n\nUnder the 301 guidelines, the tariff rate is to double to 50% on solar cell imports this year. Tariffs on certain Chinese steel and aluminum products will climb to 25% this year. Computer chip tariffs will double to 50% by 2025.\n\nFor lithium-ion EV batteries, tariffs will rise from 7.5% to 25% this year. But for non-EV batteries of the same type, the tariff increase will be implemented in 2026. There are also higher tariffs on ship-to-shore cranes, critical minerals and medical products.\n\nThe new tariffs, at least initially, are largely symbolic since they will apply to only about $18 billion in imports. A new analysis by Oxford Economics estimates the tariffs will have a barely noticeable impact on inflation by pushing up inflation by just 0.01%.\n\nThe Chinese EV maker BYD has explored the possibility of opening factories in Mexico for the Mexican market, possibly creating a way to ship goods into the United States. U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said she was talking with industry and workers about the possibility and to \u201cstay tuned.\u201d\n\nThe auto industry is still trying to assess the impact of the tariffs. But at present, it appears they could be assessed on only two Chinese-made vehicles, the Polestar 2 luxury EV and potentially Volvo\u2019s S90 luxury gas-electric hybrid midsize sedan.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still reviewing the tariffs to understand exactly what\u2019s affected and how,\u201d said Russell Datz, spokesman for Volvo, a Swedish brand now under China\u2019s Geely group. A message was left seeking comment from Polestar, which also falls under Geely.\n\nThe Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, said the U.S. is trampling on the principles of a market economy and international economic and trade rules.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a naked act of bullying,\u201d Wang said.\n\nThe Chinese economy has been slowed by the collapse of the country\u2019s real estate market and past coronavirus pandemic lockdowns, prompting Chinese President Xi Jinping to try to jumpstart growth by ramping up production of EVs and other products, making more than the Chinese market can absorb.\n\nThis strategy further exacerbates tensions with a U.S. government that claims it\u2019s determined to strengthen its own manufacturing to compete with China, yet avoid a larger conflict.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s factory-led recovery and weak consumption growth, which are translating into excess capacity and an aggressive search for foreign markets, in tandem with the looming U.S. election season add up to a perfect recipe for escalating U.S. trade fractions with China,\u2019\u2019 said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University.\n\nThe Europeans are worried, too. The EU launched an investigation last fall into Chinese subsidies and could impose an import tax on Chinese EVs.\n\nAfter Xi\u2019s visit to France last week, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned that government-subsidized Chinese EVs and steel \u201care flooding the European market\u201d and said, \u201cThe world cannot absorb China\u2019s surplus production.\u2019\u2019\n\nBiden\u2019s administration views China, with its subsidies of manufacturing, as trying to globally control the EV and clean-energy sectors, whereas the administration says its own industrial support is geared toward ensuring domestic supplies to help meet U.S. demand.\n\n\u201cWe do not seek to have global domination of manufacturing in these sectors, but we believe because these are strategic industries and for the sake of resilience of our supply chains, that we want to make sure that we have healthy and active firms,\u201d Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said.\n\nThe tensions go far beyond a trade dispute to deeper questions about who leads the world economy as a seemingly indispensable nation. China\u2019s policies could make the world more dependent on its factories, possibly giving it greater leverage in geopolitics. At the same time, the United States says it\u2019s seeking for countries to operate by the same standards so competition can be fair.\n\nChina maintains the tariffs are in violation of the global trade rules the United States originally helped establish through the World Trade Organization. It accuses the U.S. of continuing to politicize trade issues and on Friday said the new tariffs compound the problems caused by tariffs the Trump administration previously put on Chinese goods, which Biden has kept.\n\nThose issues are at the heart of November\u2019s presidential election, with a bitterly divided electorate seemingly united by the idea of getting tough with China. Biden and Trump have overlapping but different strategies.\n\nBiden sees targeted tariffs as needed to defend key industries and workers, while Trump has threatened broad 10% tariffs against all imports from rivals and allies alike.\n\nBiden has staked his presidential legacy on the U.S. pulling ahead of China with its own government investments in factories to make EVs, computer chips and other advanced technologies.\n\nTrump tells his supporters America is falling further behind China by not betting on oil to keep powering the economy, despite its climate change risks. The ex-president may believe tariffs can change Chinese behavior, but he believes the U.S. will be reliant on China for EV components and solar cells.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden\u2019s economic plan is to make China rich and America poor,\u201d he said at a rally this month in Wisconsin.\n\n__\n\nAP autos writer Tom Krisher contributed to this report from Detroit.",

They were hoping to be picked for work on a construction site, at a farm, as a mover \u2014 anything that would pay.\n\nWang had no luck, even as he waited for two more hours. It would be another day without a job since he crossed the southern U.S. border illegally in February, seeking better financial prospects than he had in his hometown of Wuhan, China.\n\nWang Gang, 36, center left, a Chinese immigrant, talks with the driver of a car with others as they try to get a daily paid job working construction or in another trade in the Flushing neighborhood of the Queens borough of New York on May 3, 2024.

Is that what they\u2019re trying to do?\u201d\n\nAs Trump and others exploit a surge in Chinese border crossings and real concerns about China\u2019s geopolitical threat to further their political aims, Asian advocacy organizations worry the rhetoric could encourage further harassment and violence toward the Asian community. Asian people in the U.S. already experienced a spike in hate incidents fueled by xenophobic rhetoric during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s dehumanizing rhetoric and blatant attacks against immigrant communities will, without question, only fuel more hate against not only Chinese immigrants but all Asian Americans in the U.S.,\u201d Cynthia Choi, co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate and co-executive director of Chinese for Affirmative Action, said in a statement to The Associated Press. \u201cIn the midst of an already inflamed political climate and election year, we know all too well how harmful such rhetoric can be.\u201d\n\nGregg Orton, national director of the National Council of Asian Pacific Americans, said many Asian American communities remain \u201cgripped by fear\u201d and that some Asians still feel uncomfortable about taking public transportation.\n\n\u201cTo know that we might be staring down another round of that, it\u2019s pretty sobering,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018THIS TRIP IS DEADLY\u2019\n\nWang, who traveled several weeks from Ecuador to the southern U.S. border, then spent 48 hours in an immigration detention facility before heading to Flushing, said the idea that Chinese migrants were building a military \u201cdoes not exist\u201d among the immigrants he has met.\n\n\u201cIt is impossible that they would walk on foot for over one month\u201d for that purpose, he said. \u201cWe came here to make money.\u201d\n\nImmigrants who spoke to the AP in Flushing, a densely populated Chinese cultural enclave in Queens, said they came to the U.S. to escape poverty and financial losses from China\u2019s strict lockdown during the pandemic, or to escape the threat of imprisonment in a repressive society where they couldn\u2019t speak or exercise their religion freely.\n\nMany said they continue to struggle to get by. Life in the U.S. is not what they had imagined.\n\nSince late 2022 \u2014 when China\u2019s three-year COVID-19 lockdown began to lift \u2014 the U.S. has seen a sharp rise in the number of Chinese migrants. In 2023, U.S. authorities arrested more than 37,000 Chinese nationals at the U.S.-Mexico border, more than 10 times the previous year\u2019s number. In December alone, border officials arrested 5,951 Chinese nationals on the southern border, a record monthly high, before the number trended down during the first three months of this year.\n\nThe U.S. and China just recently began cooperating again to deport Chinese immigrants who were in the country illegally.\n\nYet with tens of thousands of Chinese newcomers who have crossed into the U.S. illegally, there has been no evidence that they have tried to mount a military force or training network.\n\nChinese migrant Li Kai aka Khaled, an ethnic Hui Muslim, studies for a U.S. Commercial Driving License in his apartment in Flushing, New York, Friday, May 3, 2024.

While the data doesn\u2019t include gender, there are more men than women on the perilous route, which typically involves catching a flight to South America and then making the long, arduous trek north to the U.S. border.\n\nChinese immigrants in Flushing said one reason men may be coming alone in higher numbers is the expense \u2014 often more than $10,000 per person to cover airfare, lodging, payments to local guides and bribes to police in countries along their journey. Another could be China\u2019s longtime family planning policy that skewed the gender ratio toward males.\n\nThere\u2019s also the danger, said a 35-year-old Chinese man who only gave his family name of Yin because he was concerned about the safety of his wife and children, who remain in China.\n\nHe had arrived in Flushing in late April, five weeks after he left the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen. He had traveled through Panama\u2019s dangerous Darien Gap jungle and across Mexico. Signs of the journey were still fresh: His hair was messy, skin tanned with fine wrinkles, and his cardigan, once white, had not been washed for weeks.\n\n\u201cThis trip is deadly. People die. The trip isn\u2019t suitable for women \u2014 it\u2019s not suitable for anyone,\u201d said Yin.\n\nHe said that as the breadwinner, he came alone, with the hope his family could join him later.\n\n\u2018CHASING A BETTER LIFE\u2019\n\nWhile some in China have chosen to leave through investment schemes or talent programs in developed nations, those without resources set off for Latin America after learning from social media posts about the journey north.\n\nUpon arriving, most of them fan out to large cities such as Los Angeles, Chicago and New York with well-established Chinese communities, where they hope to get work and start a new life.\n\nImmigrants who arrived in Flushing said they came to America to escape China, not to fight on its behalf.\n\nThirty-six-year-old Chen Wang, from the southeastern Chinese province of Fujian, said he decided to come to the U.S. in late 2021 after he posted comments critical of the ruling party on Twitter. He was admonished by local police.\n\n\u201cI feared that I could be locked up, so I came to America,\u201d Chen said.\n\nChen Wang, a Chinese migrant currently homeless in New York, poses for a photo in front of his tent on Friday, May 3, 2024.

He met no one else who had served in the Chinese military and described his fellow Chinese on the journey as simply people \u201cchasing a better life.\u201d\n\nLONG HISTORY OF ASIAN STEREOTYPES\n\nTo be sure, U.S. intelligence leaders have grave concerns about the threat China\u2019s authoritarian government poses to the country through its espionage, military capabilities and more. There also have been crimes committed by Chinese immigrants, including the arrest in March of a Chinese national breaching a military base in California, but there has been no evidence to support the assertion that migrants from China are coming to the U.S. to fight Americans.\n\nDeputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell called the Chinese nationals \u201ceconomic migrants\u201d during an April town hall meeting hosted by the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations.\n\nChina has said it strongly opposes illegal immigration, and police there have arrested some who have tried to leave. Social media posts that offer advice and guides to come to the U.S. illegally have been censored in China. Instead, there are posts warning about dangers along the way and racial discrimination in the U.S.\n\nChina\u2019s foreign ministry told the AP that Trump\u2019s claims of a Chinese migrant army were \u201can egregious mismatch of the facts.\u201d The Department of Homeland Security didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nSteven Cheung, communications director for the Trump campaign, said in an emailed statement that every American should be concerned about military-age Chinese men crossing into the U.S.\n\n\u201cThese individuals have not been vetted or screened, and we have no idea who they are affiliated with or what their intention is,\u201d Cheung said. \u201cThis sets a dangerous precedent for bad actors and potentially nefarious individuals to exploit Joe Biden\u2019s porous border to send countless military-aged men into the United States completely unfettered.\u201d\n\nThe army-building narrative has been shared by many other conservatives.\n\n\u201cThey are fighting-age males, primarily single, and you know, this isn\u2019t a coincidence,\u201d Republican Rep. Mike Garcia of California said during a Fox Business interview last month, nodding when host Maria Bartiromo suggested the immigrants could later be used as \u201csaboteurs\u201d if Chinese President Xi Jinping \u201cdirects that.\u201d\n\nSapna Cheryan, a psychology professor at the University of Washington, said the claims about Chinese migrants \u2014 made without evidence \u2014 build on a long history of pervasive stereotypes that Asian people do not belong in the country, ideas that have fueled acts of violence against Asian Americans.\n\n\u201cIf that rhetoric is happening again, one thing we might be able to predict is, well, people will probably take that and feel emboldened to engage in these heinous acts,\u201d she said.\n\nLi Kai, also known as Khaled, a 44-year-old Muslim from Tangshan in the northern Hebei province, a city close to Beijing, said he was worried about Trump\u2019s statements regarding illegal immigration and Muslims, but said he has no choice other than to make his new life in the U.S. work.\n\nChinese migrant Li Kai aka Khaled, an ethnic Hui Muslim, studies for a Commercial Driving License in his apartment in Flushing, New York, Friday, May 3, 2024.

He chose the U.S. because it is a free society, where his children have learned to recite from the Quran.\n\nHe said the migrants he encountered on his journey all left China for the U.S. to try to improve their prospects in life, and he was grateful for that opportunity.

        "text": "Deactivating Facebook for just a few weeks reduces belief in fake news\nFormer U.S. president Donald Trump (left) and President Joe Biden in an image from their first electoral debate in the 2020 presidential elections in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nBefore the 2020 U.S. presidential election, more than 35,000 Facebook and Instagram users agreed to participate in an experiment. Twenty-seven percent of that randomly chosen group were paid to deactivate their accounts for six weeks. The rest only disconnected for a week. The objective was to analyze what happens when users disconnect from the two of the biggest social media networks in the most heated weeks of the U.S. political calendar.\n\nThe result is that hardly anything at all happens. Except for one detail: the group that disconnected from Facebook (not Instagram) tended to not believe the misinformation that was circulating online. On the other hand, their political participation, especially online, also decreased.\n\nThe new article, published on Monday in the journal PNAS, is the work of more than 30 academics from U.S. universities and Meta researchers. It is part of the macro study, which began to be published last summer in the magazines Science and Nature. This research found that conservatives consume more misinformation on Facebook, among other results. The project is the result of an August 2020 agreement between Meta and two professors, who then selected the rest of the researchers.\n\nOne of the authors of the article, Stanford University professor Matthew Gentzkow, says there are two main findings from the PNAS study: \u201cFirst, stopping using Facebook and Instagram in the final stretch of the election had little or no effect on political opinions, their negative opinions about opposing parties, or beliefs about complaints of electoral fraud. Second, stopping using Facebook does affect people\u2019s knowledge and beliefs. Those who went off Facebook responded worse to news tests, but they were also less likely to believe widespread misinformation, suggesting that the platform may be an important channel for both true and fake news,\u201d he says.\n\nAlthough the result is not completely clear, for Gentzkow, the finding is quite surprising: \u201cPrevious research has shown that exposure to misinformation is often quite low for most people, so I was really surprised to see this effect, which was large enough to be marginally detectable,\u201d he says.\n\nUnprecedented macro study\n\nAside from being part of an unprecedented macro study using internal Meta data, the work is also the largest ever done on social media deactivation. The sample is 10 times larger than any previous experiment, according to the article. The authors, however, admit that the work has its limitations when it comes to measuring the real impact of a network like Facebook in democracies.\n\n\u201cThis study has the same problem as the previous ones,\u201d says David Garc\u00eda, a professor at the University of Konstanz in Germany, who commented on the summer 2023 articles in Nature. \u201cIt is only able to experiment with individuals who are within a society where many other people continue to use Facebook and Instagram normally. When we talk about the Facebook effect, we think about what society would be like without Facebook compared to what it is like with Facebook, not what the people who do not use the network are like compared to those who do use it,\u201d Garc\u00eda explains.\n\nGentzkow admits that investigating that issue is beyond the reach of academia: \u201cIt is not possible to do an experiment now to directly answer the question of what polarization would have been like if Facebook had never existed.\u201d\n\nBut the experiment, at least, did clear up doubts about whether Instagram was in the same league as Facebook: the article did not find any kind of effect on the influencer-centric network. \u201cAside from a reduction in online participation, we find no significant impacts of Instagram deactivation on any other primary outcomes,\u201d the article says. \u201cThis is true even among younger users, and it suggests that despite Instagram\u2019s rapid growth, Facebook likely remains the platform with the largest impacts on political outcomes.\u201d\n\nThe study also found that users who went off Facebook for six weeks were more wary of the political information they saw on Facebook, a shift that also occurred on Instagram: \u201cOne potential explanation is that time away from a platform made users more aware of the amount of low-quality or inaccurate information to which they had been exposed,\u201d the study explains.\n\nWhile the study found that political participation (especially online) fell among the group that disconnected from Facebook, voter intention remained the same. In other words, less participation online did not lead to fewer voters at the polls.\n\nNor did Instagram and Facebook deactivation have an effect on polarization, perceived legitimacy of the elections or candidate preference. Another question that the researchers wanted to answer was how important Facebook was to Donald Trump. The study did not find definitive data that suggested the platform helped the former U.S. president. Although the results are \u201cstatistically insignificant,\u201d they do suggest that deactivation had an effect on who participants voted for. \u201cDeactivation decreased Trump favorability, decreased turnout among Republicans and increased turnout among Democrats,\u201d the article states.\n\nResearcher David Garc\u00eda believes that the work could have been clearer on this point: \u201cThe result regarding Trump favorability is very interesting. It does not reach the level pre-specified by the scientists, but because the standard of evidence they had is very high. If they had assumed that Facebook deactivation lowers the vote for Trump, it would have passed the test. I see more important evidence than what appears in the text. The effect was small for the amount of data they had, but it doesn\u2019t seem so small to me when you think about how close elections in the U.S. tend to be,\u201d he explains.\n\nFacebook invited 10.6 million users to take part in the study and 637,388 clicked the invitation. Of this figure, only 19,857 people completed the experiment, which also involved a series of surveys. Participants who deactivated their account for six weeks were paid $150. On Instagram, Meta invited 2.6 million users and achieved 15,585 participants.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition",

        "text": "GOP politicians rush to Manhattan to line up behind Trump as hush money trial continues \u2022 Nebraska Examiner\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Republican lawmakers are taking turns supporting former president and presumed 2024 GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump in his trial in Manhattan criminal court, where he is charged with covering up payments intended to silence porn star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election.\n\nDressed alike in navy blue suits and red ties, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, viewed as a 2024 vice presidential contender, former GOP primary hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy and U.S. Reps. Byron Donalds and Cory Mills of Florida filed behind Trump into the courtroom Tuesday morning, according to reporters present. Outside, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, conducted a press conference.\n\nThe entourage followed appearances Monday by U.S. Sens. J.D. Vance of Ohio, another contender on Trump\u2019s VP short list, and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, and Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird, as well as an appearance last week by U.S. Sen. Rick Scott of Florida.\n\nTuesday\u2019s show of solidarity occurred as the prosecution\u2019s star witness and former Trump fixer Michael Cohen took the stand for a second day to testify that Trump signed off on falsifying reimbursement to Cohen for $130,000 of his own money that Cohen paid to Daniels on the eve of the 2016 election.\n\nJurors again saw checks signed by Trump and heard from Cohen about instructions from Trump associates to submit fake invoices for \u201clegal services rendered.\u201d Cohen also described a February 2017 Oval Office meeting during which he discussed the reimbursement with Trump, according to reporters at the courthouse.\n\nNew York does not allow recording in the courtroom but provides public transcripts of the proceedings.\n\nCohen followed high-profile and detailed testimony last week from adult film actress and director Daniels about her alleged sex affair with Trump in 2006, an event he denies.\n\nTrump is facing 34 felony counts for each alleged falsified business record related to his repayment to Cohen \u2014 11 invoices, 11 checks and 12 ledger entries.\n\nA \u2018sham\u2019 to \u2018keep him off of the campaign trail\u2019\n\nOut on the sidewalk, Johnson \u2014 the second in line for presidential succession after the vice president \u2014 told reporters he wanted \u201cto call out what is a travesty of justice.\u201d\n\nWith a sarcastic snicker and gesture toward the New York County Supreme Court location on Centre Street in Lower Manhattan, Johnson lamented that he had to speak to media outside \u201cbecause the court won\u2019t allow us to speak inside the building. That\u2019s just one of the many things that are wrong here.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that surrogates routinely make comments outside courthouses.\n\nJohnson summed up what he called a \u201csham trial\u201d as a conspiracy to stymie Trump\u2019s reelection campaign \u2014 despite recent New York Times/Siena College polls showing the former president leading in several swing states.\n\n\u201cThis is the fifth week that President Trump has been in court for this sham of a trial,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThey are doing this intentionally to keep him here and keep him off of the campaign trail, and I think everybody in the country can see that for what it is.\u201d\n\nThe trial meets weekdays, except Wednesdays.\n\nTrump hit the campaign trail Saturday at a rally in Wildwood, New Jersey, where he spoke for 90 minutes, criticizing the New York trial, repeating false claims that he won the 2020 presidential election, calling the \u201clate, great\u201d fictional cannibal serial killer Hannibal Lecter \u201ca wonderful man,\u201d and thanking the six U.S. Supreme Court justices \u2014 three of whom he appointed \u2014 for overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\n\u2018Election interference\u2019\n\nTrump\u2019s allies echoed Johnson\u2019s earlier remarks in their own press conference later outside the courthouse, calling the trial a \u201cscam\u201d and \u201cjoke,\u201d according to reporters at the event.\n\nRamaswamy reportedly likened the courtroom to a \u201cKafka novel\u201d and called it \u201cone of the most depressing places I have been in my life\u201d and said the prosecution\u2019s strategy is \u201cto bore jurors into submission.\u201d\n\nIn a video of the press conference he posted to X, the entrepreneur said the \u201cjustice system should be blind to politics\u201d and accused Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg of targeting Trump for political reasons.\n\nBurgum characterized the trial as \u201celection interference\u201d in the 2024 race. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s critics say the trial is squarely about election interference that occurred in 2016.\n\nMills said \u201cwhat was the Department of Justice, now the department of injustice, has continued to be utilized against the American people.\u201d\n\nThe charges for which Trump is now on trial did not originate with the U.S. Department of Justice, but rather from a New York state grand jury investigation.\n\nTrump\u2019s two federal cases are in a holding pattern while, for one, the U.S. Supreme Court deliberates over Trump\u2019s claim of absolute immunity from criminal charges that he schemed to subvert the 2020 presidential election results. The second, centered on Trump\u2019s alleged mishandling of classified documents following his presidency, has been put indefinitely on hold by federal district Judge Aileen Cannon in Florida.\n\nThe New York trial is expected to resume Thursday with further cross-examination of Cohen by Trump attorney Todd Blanche.",

        "summary": " The New York Times/Siena College poll finds Donald Trump leading President Joe Biden in five of six battleground states . Biden's deficits appear insurmountable in the Sun Belt battlegrounds of Arizona, Georgia, and Nevada . But in the Great Lakes swing states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, Biden is doing much better .",
        "text": "The silver lining in a very bad poll for Biden\nis a senior politics reporter at Vox, where he covers the Democratic Party. He joined Vox in 2022 after reporting on national and international politics for the Atlantic\u2019s politics, global, and ideas teams, including the role of Latino voters in the 2020 election.\n\nIf the 2024 presidential election were held today, it seems likely that Donald Trump would win the presidency. The latest New York Times/Siena College poll suggests as much, finding Trump leading President Joe Biden in five of six battleground states that will likely decide the Electoral College vote.\n\nAnd yet, there\u2019s still some hope for the Biden camp \u2014 thanks to a regional division in the poll\u2019s results.\n\nBiden\u2019s deficits appear insurmountable in the Sun Belt battlegrounds of Arizona (Trump plus 6 among likely voters), Georgia (Trump plus 9), and Nevada (Trump plus 13).\n\nBut in the Great Lakes swing states of Michigan (Biden plus 1 among likely voters), Pennsylvania (Trump plus 3), and Wisconsin (Trump plus 1), Biden is doing much better. And if he won all three of those states, plus the non-swing states he\u2019s expected to win comfortably, he could reach the 270 Electoral College votes he needs for a second term in the White House.\n\nWhy and how this is happening may provide some insights into what the Trump and Biden campaigns will have to do to win the election. But more generally, pollsters and polling analysts told me that the divide also reveals a lot about the state of the nation, of polling, and of how the electorate is changing.\n\nYounger and nonwhite voters \u2014 two bedrocks of the Democratic coalition \u2014 are especially unhappy with Biden, largely because of the state of the economy. Those voters are a more influential segment of the electorate in these Sun Belt states. They are a key part of the Democratic coalition, and they have not necessarily made peace with supporting Biden\u2019s reelection. The opposite is largely true in the original Blue Wall states.\n\n\u201cThe interesting thing for me is to see, in the Midwest states, that Republicans are acting like Republicans, and Democrats are acting like Democrats. But if I\u2019m looking at the [Sun Belt] states, what it boils down to is Republicans are coalesced, but Democrats aren\u2019t yet,\u201d the Republican pollster Amanda Iovino told me. \u201cBiden is still having a problem with his base in these states.\u201d\n\nIn all six states, Trump receives the support of about 90 percent or more of self-identified Republicans. But the same is true for Biden only in those Great Lakes states: He gets the backing of 94 percent of Democrats in Michigan, 90 percent of Democrats in Pennsylvania, and 93 percent of Democrats in Wisconsin.\n\nIn the Sun Belt, Democrats are much more divided \u2014 or defecting to Trump: 84 percent of Democrats back Biden in all three states.\n\nHere, it\u2019s helpful to understand how differently the electorates look in the north and south: White voters make up about 84 percent of the electorate in Wisconsin, 79 percent of the electorate in Pennsylvania, and 74 percent of the electorate in Michigan. They make up just about half of the electorate in Georgia and Nevada, and about 60 percent of the electorate in Arizona.\n\n\u201cBiden\u2019s struggles primarily come from nonwhite voters right now. There\u2019s a lot of those in the Sun Belt states,\u201d Lakshya Jain, an analyst at the election modeling website Split Ticket, told me. \u201cAdd on to that the fact that in the Sun Belt, white voters are generally a little bit more conservative. Democratic strength in the Sun Belt comes from good minority margins, and if in polls, Biden is holding up well with white voters, but not necessarily super well with nonwhites, then you would expect that to be magnified in the Sun Belt, because that\u2019s where whites are already pretty conservative and you have a very high share of minority voters.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to Georgia as a prime example: Black voters make up about 30 percent of the electorate. If Biden is struggling with Black voters, that would have a significant effect on his overall levels of support in the state, since Democrats routinely lose white voters by huge margins.\n\nOf course, this poll provides a snapshot in time. And Jain, Iovino, and other data experts I spoke to told me they\u2019re not entirely convinced with the specific numbers in the crosstabs: Trump, for example, is supposedly leading Biden among young voters nationally and winning women in Nevada. The Times itself notes:\n\nMr. Trump and Mr. Biden are essentially tied among 18-to-29-year-olds and Hispanic voters, even though each group gave Mr. Biden more than 60 percent of their vote in 2020. Mr. Trump also wins more than 20 percent of Black voters \u2014 a tally that would be the highest level of Black support for any Republican presidential candidate since the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nBut the data still provides signs about the direction the electorate is leaning, as well the reasons for that lean: discontent with the economy above everything else (though abortion and immigration come in as the other top issues). About 90 percent of young voters and 85 percent of Latino voters think the economy is fair or poor, and Trump is trusted better on the economy by both those groups. Those signs suggest Biden has huge room to make improvements and craft a better message if he wants to make a dent in that Trump advantage.\n\nAnd despite the prevalence of the Israel-Palestine conflict, the issue does not seem to be the driver of Biden\u2019s base or electorate troubles.\n\n\u201cDefections over Gaza make up a little over 1 percent of Biden\u2019s 2020 vote share. That\u2019s not nothing, but also that\u2019s such a small share. If you want to look at why Biden is sliding, the bigger reason is obviously the economy,\u201d Jain told me. \u201cIf you look at people defecting over Gaza, 17 percent of them think that it\u2019s because he\u2019s been too favorable to Palestine.\u201d\n\nFinally, there are some additional kernels of information to watch: Democratic Senate candidates are performing better than Biden and receiving higher support from Democratic voters themselves. That suggests that 2024 could either be a banner year for split-ticket voting, or a year where these Democrats \u201ccome home\u201d and bring themselves to vote for Biden after all.\n\nOf course, this is still not the best news for Democrats. Trump\u2019s leads in those Sun Belt states have only increased since the last time they were polled in this Times/Siena survey. A look under the hood shows an upset and disengaged electorate \u2014 but one with many persuadable voters and Americans who may soon tune back into the political cycle.\n\n\u201cBiden probably has a fair bit of room to grow,\u201d Jain told me. \u201cRight now, what it is, is the election is exceptionally low salience for a presidential election, and that\u2019s because it\u2019s six months out.\u201d",

        "text": "Presidential Polls Are Useless. Here\u2019s Why\nThis article was made possible because of the generous support of DAME members. We urgently need your help to keep publishing. Will you contribute just $5 a month to support our journalism?\n\nIn the months leading up to the most consequential presidential election in history, it\u2019s easy to see why everyone\u2019s jumpy.\n\nEvery passing hour seems to bring a new poll showing former President Donald Trump ahead of incumbent Joe Biden, or Biden ahead of Trump. And with it, another round of BREAKING NEWS SCOOPING SCOOP alerts about the polls, plus a round of discussion on the news about whether those polls matter.\n\nFor the audience, this constant barrage of non-news not only foments anxiety but disseminates misinformation. At a time when journalism claims to be locked in a vital fight against bad info from bad actors, the industry is reserving its greatest resources for a kind of story designed to confuse us and tell us less, not more.\n\nLet\u2019s take a recent CNN poll story, touting its own numbers that pit Trump and Biden against each other:\n\nTrump\u2019s support in the poll among registered voters holds steady at 49% in a head-to-head matchup against Biden, the same as in CNN\u2019s last national poll on the race in January, while Biden\u2019s stands at 43%, not significantly different from January\u2019s 45%. Looking back, 55% of all Americans now say they see Trump\u2019s presidency as a success, while 44% see it as a failure. In a January 2021 poll taken just before Trump left office and days after the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, 55% considered his time as president a failure.\n\nPanic-inducing! Maddening! Terrifying! More than half of Americans want to return to office a belligerent bigot who encouraged an armed uprising of fascists attacking the U.S. Capitol to overturn a legal election. More than half of Americans think banning Muslims from immigrating and militarizing the southern border and letting another pandemic rage is a-OK. Half the country is so thoroughly marinated in right-wing propaganda that they\u2019d let an incompetent criminal sex predator run the country and control their children\u2019s futures.\n\nBut it\u2019s irrelevant. Despite its angina-inducing headlines and the reams of reactions and reflections it induced when it was first published, the poll doesn\u2019t matter, in part due to the fact that it was a national head-to-head Biden vs. Trump poll that drew from \u201ca random national sample of 1,212 adults drawn from a probability-based panel, including 967 registered voters.\u201d\n\n\n\nNewsletter Never miss another story. With \"This Week In DAME\" delivered straight to your inbox on Fridays, your weekend reading is set!\n\n\n\nOur presidential elections are determined by the electoral college, which means it doesn\u2019t matter what people in general think. If it were, I\u2019d be in line to visit the Al Gore Presidential Library right now.\n\nRecall that in 2000, then\u2013Vice-President Gore won the popular contest by more than 500,000 votes across the nation. But the highly contested state of Florida\u2014with its 25 electoral votes\u2014 was awarded to George W. Bush, giving him the victory. Hillary Clinton\u2019s popular vote margin was even greater, more than 3 million votes, but Donald Trump\u2019s securing of several Midwest states tipped the electoral college in his favor.\n\nSo why bother polling, when a significant portion of those polled aren\u2019t even registered to vote, much less likely to do so? National head-to-head polls are useless in this country for measuring anything except the general vibe.\n\nAnd the general vibe, despite what pundits may tell us, is not predictive of much if anything. In 2016, the media and the conventional wisdom told us that Trump was a gigantic fool who was going to lose horrifically enough to take the entire GOP down in flames with him. The general vibe during the 2022 midterms was that Democrats in races from Georgia to Oregon had no shot in hell. The general vibe, as understood by the politics sages at the corporate press, stands no chance against actual voters doing their actual voting.\n\nWhich is the second reason so many of these polls are pointless. We\u2019re six months away from the general election. Repeatedly, we\u2019ve seen huge swings in presidential elections in the final months, from the movement away from Hillary Clinton to Trump in swing states like Wisconsin and Ohio, to the cratering of former president Jimmy Carter\u2019s support in his contest against Ronald Reagan in 1980.\n\nEveryone reporting on politics in America knows these two things. So why do we see so many polls and poll stories? The answer is a combination of laziness and greed.\n\nThey want something to post to feed the ever-hungry internet beast that is the 24-7 news cycle. They want something to drive clicks, drive Discourse, and drive the kinds of acrimonious online arguments that lead to trending topics that lead to panel discussions on TV that lead to promotions that lead to covering bigger and bigger stories.\n\nThey want to hear \u201cCNN poll\u201d over and over in other news outlets, and they don\u2019t really fear being held to account for misleading the American people because, as we\u2019ve pointed out earlier in this space, there is no mechanism to hold them to account. A poll says one thing one day, and another thing another, and both stories are treated the same way. It\u2019s no wonder people throw up their hands and decide to stop paying attention.\n\nPoll stories are easy to do. Lay out the numbers, find a poli-sci professor to comment on them, and you\u2019re done. But when that\u2019s the substance of a news outlet\u2019s political coverage, who\u2019s up and who\u2019s down like it\u2019s all a big wacky game, the impact of politicians\u2019 decisions get reduced to their effect on the numbers. Candidates themselves become flattened in this kind of storytelling, reduced to two equal opposites, falsely equivalent.\n\nPoll utility in general is dubious for the general public. Reporting that centers state-by-state polls, that prioritizes explanations of how polls were conducted, is mostly useful for conveying to campaigns where they should allocate resources: Oh no, Wisconsin\u2019s looking shaky, better open up a few new offices and plan another event there! Looks like Iowa\u2019s solid, no need to attend the umpteenth county fair and be photographed awkwardly eating a corn dog.\n\nIs that useful, though, for anyone who\u2019s working a job and trying to get home on time to pick the kids up from daycare and find out even a little about what\u2019s going on? Should as much airtime and resources be devoted to measuring the general, like, feeling in the room as the candidates\u2019 actual promises and track records? While talking heads are freaking out on TV hourly about slight variations in numbers, are they actually teaching anyone anything?\n\nAt best, polls would be showing who cared the most about what issues, and how political candidates at many levels were attempting to meet those needs. But they\u2019re just making us all stressed out and miserable and feeding the panic that, frankly, doesn\u2019t need another meal.",

        "text": "The Crypto Industry\u2019s Influence on U.S. Elections is Bigger Than Ever, Industry Insiders Say\nThe crypto lobby is more powerful than ever this year, and has already shaped some key Congressional elections\n\nThe crypto industry is hoping that a friendlier and more educated group of lawmakers could finally push through a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies\n\nThough crypto-holding voters tend to prefer Trump for president, industry insiders are split on whether or not a Trump presidency would actually be better for crypto\n\nThe crypto industry is throwing its weight around in Washington in hopes of influencing the upcoming U.S. elections, spending an unprecedented amount of money to get crypto-friendly candidates elected and educate lawmakers \u2013 all in hopes of finally getting a friendly regulatory framework for crypto established.\n\nCrypto-focused political action committees (PACs) like Fairshake \u2013 which has raised around $85 million from a collection of crypto companies, executives and retail investors \u2013 have successfully shaped the outcome of some relevant races, including spending $10 million helping squash the bid of crypto-critical Congresswoman Katie Porter (D-Calif.).\n\nStory continues below Don't miss another story.

See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy .\n\nFairshake has also poured money into two affiliated PACs: Defend American Jobs, which donates to Republican candidates, and Protect Progress, which donates to Democrats. Both have donated to winning campaigns. Over the last two months, Defend American Jobs spent nearly $500,000 on media buys for Republican Mark Messmer, an Indiana state senator, who won the Republican nomination for Indiana\u2019s 8th district congressional seat this week.\n\nSome of Protect Progress\u2019 crypto-friendly Democratic candidates, including Shomari Figures, who is running for a House seat in Alabama and Julie Johnson in Texas, have also won their primaries with media buy help.\n\n\"It\u2019s at a level that we just haven\u2019t seen in past election cycles,\" said Kristin Smith, CEO of crypto lobbying group the Blockchain Association.\n\nIndustry insiders say the economic power of the industry has even spurred some crypto skeptics \u2013 including Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, who is up for re-election this year \u2013 to take a more open-minded stance towards crypto, lest they face well-funded opposition efforts from the industry.\n\n\"Previously he was no friend of crypto but recently [Brown] said he was open to considering cryptocurrency legislation,\" said Kyle Bligen, director of financial policy at the tech-focused Chamber of Progress. \"I think he\u2019s cognizant of the money from outside industry groups that are looking for politicians that are open to reasonable, common-sense cryptocurrency policies and aren't just trying to prop up or support the traditional financial ecosystem without allowing for innovation.\"\n\nThough the industry\u2019s past efforts to shape national-level election outcomes have been largely unsuccessful \u2013 and, in the case of former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, criminal \u2013 the crypto industry\u2019s growing political influence now seems to have more staying power.\n\n\"It\u2019s a much more sophisticated operation,\" Smith said. \"I feel like I used to walk around Washington, and people would say \u2018Oh, there\u2019s Kristin, she works for that little blockchain industry thing.\u2019 Now it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh wow, that\u2019s the powerful crypto industry and they\u2019re here to influence Washington and are pulling out all the tools to do it.\"\n\nAll eyes on the Presidential\n\nThough the crypto industry has largely focused its lobbying efforts on Congressional elections, the U.S. presidential election will also have a significant impact on crypto regulation.\n\nAccording to at least one small poll commissioned by crypto investment firm Paradigm,, crypto-holding voters tend to prefer Donald Trump for president \u2013 although, according to other polls, the percentage of voters who own crypto is small. Polymarket bettors currently give Trump the slight edge to win (47% to Biden\u2019s 44%). But industry insiders are less certain on whether a Trump presidency would actually be better for crypto.\n\nDuring his presidency Trump was outspoken about his distaste for crypto but has since softened his stance, even saying earlier this week that he was open to accepting crypto campaign donations. In an interviews with CNBC earlier this year, Trump admitted to dabbling in the markets himself (he has sold several tranches of non-fungible tokens) and said that he is \"not sure [he would] want to take it away at this point,\" though implied that he could move to curb crypto\u2019s influence if it ever undermined the dominance of the U.S. dollar.\n\nThough Trump\u2019s crypto stance is shifting, it\u2019s still markedly less crypto-friendly than that of his former competitor for the Republican presidential nomination, Vivek Ramaswamy, who pledged to protect crypto developers and create a clear regulatory structure for crypto that would see most tokens as commodities.\n\nEven though Ramawamy is no longer in the running \u2013 and will reportedly not be considered as Trump\u2019s running mate \u2013 industry insiders suggest his crypto policies could still have an influence on Trump if he\u2019s elected.\n\n\"Trump looks to Vivek on tech and digital asset policy,\" claimed Lee Bratcher, founder and president of the Texas Blockchain Council. \"He didn\u2019t always do that, but when he saw how Vivek captured the Republican voter \u2013 and more centrist [voters] than Trump can capture \u2013 he\u2019s probably more interested in that [policy].\"\n\nBiden, re-elected\n\nIndustry insiders were split on whether a Biden re-election would be bad for the crypto industry.\n\nSmith said it would likely be \"more of the same, unless [Securities and Exchange Commission Chair] Gary Gensler decides to step aside,\" meaning continued regulatory uncertainty and aggressive enforcement actions. A better, more open-minded SEC chair, she added, would be \"hugely helpful.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s unfortunate because, at the beginning of the Biden Administration there was some interest in crypto \u2013 and then the industry imploded while they were doing all of their reports and as a result they\u2019re in a clearly negative spot right now,\" Smith said. \"On [Biden\u2019s] watch, the industry had some not-so-great moments and it\u2019s understandable that regulators are concerned.\"\n\nSmith said that, while the crypto industry has largely moved on from the 2022 crypto collapse \u2013 including the implosions of FTX, Terra/LUNA and Three Arrows Capital \u2013 regulators have much longer memories.\n\n\"Having a fresh batch of regulators come in would be helpful in re-starting conversations,\" Smith said.\n\nOthers, like Bligen, seemed more hopeful for crypto-friendly legislation to pass post-election if Biden stays in power.\n\n\"I can\u2019t say that if President Biden is reelected that that\u2019s a loss for cryptocurrency advocates, because currently in this regime Democrats and Republicans are working together on a bipartisan basis to produce productive and responsible cryptocurrency [legislation],\" said Bligen.\n\nThere are ongoing efforts in the current Congress to pass crypto legislation, including a bipartisan effort to regulate stablecoins.\n\nChallenges to progress\n\nThose efforts at legislation \u2013 which, in the past, have failed to find footing \u2013 still have significant hurdles to clear before being passed, including getting more members of Congress on board with crypto.\n\nBligen said that there are still many members of Congress who don\u2019t know much about crypto, and the things they do know about it \"come from flashy headlines about cryptocurrency scams, people misrepresenting coins, people being defrauded out of their money, massive crypto institutions failing \u2013 they view it from a protectionist angle,\" he said.\n\n\"If you want to have more people that are friendly to crypto, every single office needs to be provided with a base understanding of what is cryptocurrency, why does it matter to my constituents and what is the policy landscape that regulates it. Everybody needs to know that,\" Bligen said. \"If you don\u2019t have that basic information, you\u2019re going to have members fumbling around, trying to grasp what blockchain technology is\u2026there needs to be more concerted education efforts. We\u2019re not just going to get to a more educated 2025, work has to be put in.\"\n\nBratcher added that, in addition to education efforts, the industry may have to compromise on certain issues \u2013 like privacy \u2013 in order to make real progress with lawmakers.\n\n\"We stand at an interesting crossroads when it comes to privacy,\" Bratcher said, referencing the ongoing crackdown on bitcoin mixing services like Tornado Cash and Samourai Wallet.\n\n\"People in the digital assets industry want to prioritize privacy above everything else. When we work with government \u2013 state, local and national, and even with law enforcement \u2013 we don\u2019t have the luxury of being able to make grandiose claims around that, Bratcher added. \"There will have to be a balance between privacy and issues pertaining to money laundering and national security.\"\n\nBratcher said that bad behavior by privacy services like Samourai \u2013 which actively promoted its mixing services to \"dark/grey market participants\" \u2013 makes working with elected officials much harder.\n\n\"Tornado Cash is not a hill I\u2019m willing to die on,\" Bratcher said. \"We could lose a war if we choose to die on the hill of Tornado Cash.\"\n\nState-level politics\n\nThough the spotlight is on national elections, Bratcher and others \u2013 like Dennis Porter, CEO and co-founder of bitcoin mining advocacy group Satoshi Action Fund \u2013 are focusing their efforts on state politics.\n\nPorter\u2019s group has helped introduce bills in 16 U.S. states that provide protections for bitcoin mining and self-custody. The furthest along of the bills is in Oklahoma, where it has been passed in both the state House and Senate, and is awaiting a signature by Governor Kevin Stitt (R).\n\n\"D.C. is fun and sexy. Tons of money is spent there, but so far we haven\u2019t seen any big wins \u2013 all of the important battles are happening at the state level,\" Porter said.\n\nPorter said the industry should continue to build its presence in D.C. but said that it will not find the magical cure to all of its ills on Capitol Hill.\n\n\"The way that we\u2019re going to do that is at the state level,\" Porter said. \"We\u2019re going to go state-by-state advocating for pro-digital assets policy using the states as a laboratory for democracy, eventually taking those good ideas and using them to influence policy at the federal level. Or at the bare minimum, creating a regulatory regime that protects people at the state level.\"\n\nPorter\u2019s model for crypto regulation takes a page out of the cannabis industry\u2019s playbook \u2013 building up momentum and support in the states until the industry is powerful enough to shape federal regulations.\n\n\"We\u2019re swinging for home runs over and over and over again in D.C. but we\u2019re not strong enough yet,\" Porter said. \"I just think we\u2019re further away from that than we realize\u2026The big story for me is that we need to be spending much more time at the state level, investing much more money, because the hundreds of millions of dollars being spent in D.C., if spent at the state level, would radically reshape the policy landscape and would radically change the dynamic for bitcoin and digital assets in America.\"",

More than half think all three abuses are at least somewhat likely to occur.\n\nThe Imagining the Digital Future Center works to discover and broadly share a diverse range of opinions, ideas and original research about the impact of digital change. This survey was done in collaboration with the Elon Poll, which conducts statewide and national surveys on issues of importance to voters throughout the nation and in North Carolina. View the full survey results for more details on the findings as well as the survey methodology.\n\nThese concerns about AI and the election put Americans in a punishing frame of mind. Fully 93% think some penalty should be applied to candidates who maliciously and intentionally alter or fake photos, videos or audio files.\n\n46% think the punishment should be removal from office.\n\n36% say offenders should face criminal prosecution.\n\nBy a nearly 8-1 margin, more Americans feel the use of AI will hurt the coming election than help it: 39% say it will hurt and 5% think it will help. Some 37% say they are not sure.\n\nAmericans\u2019 concerns about the use and impact of AI systems occur in a challenging and confusing news and information environment.\n\n52% are not confident they can detect altered or faked audio material.\n\n47% are not confident they can detect altered videos.\n\n45% say they are not confident they can detect faked photos.\n\nThey have far less faith in the capacity of others to detect fakes: About 7-in-10 are not confident in most voters\u2019 ability to detect photos, videos and audio that have been altered or faked.\n\n\u201cVoters think this election will unfold in an extraordinarily challenging news and information environment,\u201d said Lee Rainie, Director of Elon University\u2019s Imagining the Digital Future Center. \u201cThey anticipate that new kinds of misinformation, faked material and voter-manipulation tactics are being enabled by AI. What\u2019s worse, many aren\u2019t sure they can sort through the garbage they know will be polluting campaign-related content.\u201d\n\nThis survey finds that 23% of U.S. adults have used large language models (LLMs) or chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude. And it explores one of the main concerns related to these models: Are they mostly fair or mostly biased when they answer users\u2019 questions related to politics and public policy-related issues?\n\nMajorities of Democrats, Republicans and independents say they are not sure if these systems are fair or biased to different groups. At the same time, there are some notable differences among partisans who do have views. Republicans are generally more wary of AI models than Democrats are. For instance, Republicans are more likely to think AI systems are biased against their views. Surprisingly, they are also more likely than Democrats to think that AI systems are biased against the views of Democrats.\n\nHere are the findings:\n\n36% of Republicans think AI systems are biased against Republicans, compared with 15% of Democrats who think that.\n\n23% of Republicans also (or \u201cparadoxically\u201d) think AI systems are biased against Democrats, compared with 14% of Democrats who think that.\n\nIn addition, Republicans are more likely than Democrats to think AI systems are biased against men and White people. Democrats are somewhat less likely than Republicans to think those biases exist in AI systems.\n\nSome 60% of Americans say they are \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d confident people\u2019s votes will be accurately cast and counted. On this question, 83% of Democrats are confident, while 60% of Republicans are not confident.\n\n\u201cMisinformation in elections has been around since before the invention of computers, but many worry about the sophistication of AI technology in 2024 giving bad actors an accessible tool to spread misinformation at an unprecedented scale,\u201d said Jason Husser, professor of political science and director of the Elon University Poll. \u201cWe know that most voters are aware of AI risks to the 2024 election. However, the behavioral implications of that awareness will remain unclear until we see the aftermath of AI-generated misinformation. An optimistic hope is that risk-aware voters may approach information in the 2024 cycle with heightened caution, leading them to become more sophisticated consumers of political information. A pessimistic outlook is that worries about AI-misinformation might translate into diminished feelings of self-efficacy, institutional trust and civic engagement.\u201d\n\nThe survey reported here was conducted from April 19-21, 2024, among 1,020 U.S. adults. It has a margin of error of 3.2 percentage points. Read the full methodology for more details.",

        "text": "Kennedy regarded as potential spoiler in US presidential election\nThere are few things the presidential campaigns of Donald Trump and Joe Biden agree on. One is the presidential candidacy of activist-lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Both the Biden and Trump camps see Kennedy as a potential spoiler in this November's election.\n\nAbout half of registered voters have told pollsters that if given the chance, they would replace both Biden and Trump on this year's ballot.\n\n\"If you picture what this country is going to look like in November if either President Trump or President Biden won, the division is going to continue,\" Kennedy said at a California campaign event to introduce his running mate, 38-year-old attorney and philanthropist Nicole Shanahan. \"The anger, the vitriol, the chaos, the polarization is going to worsen. The only way to end that is through my successful candidacy.\"\n\nNeither Kennedy nor Shanahan has ever held elective office.\n\nKennedy's father was Robert F. Kennedy, a former U.S. attorney general and a senator, and a major contender in the 1968 Democratic Party presidential primary until he was assassinated. His uncle was President John F. Kennedy, slain while in office in 1963.\n\n\"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is not going to be the next president,\" predicts Georgetown University Associate Professor Hans Noel, echoing the consensus of his fellow political scientists.\n\nWhat worries the Biden and Trump campaigns is the possibility of Kennedy on the ballot in the half-dozen or so swing states where his mere thousands of votes could \"change the outcome of that state. Then of course, that tips the direction of that state \u2014 if that state is large enough \u2014 and the ultimate election is fairly close, which is what we expect. Then, it could change the outcome of the race,\" Noel tells VOA.\n\nDuring a recent appearance on MSNBC, Kennedy declared \"I'm going to be on the ballot in every state. I'll be on the ballot in every state by July.\"\n\nKennedy's team declined VOA's request to make the candidate or a surrogate available to respond to questions, saying \"the campaign has decided to only grant interviews to U.S press with targeted U.S. audiences at this time.\"\n\nThe Kennedy clan \"is not happy at all that he's running, and they've made a number of efforts to make that very clear,\" notes Noel.\n\nBiden, during a recent campaign appearance in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania, was surrounded by Kennedy family members, including the independent candidate's sister, Kerry Kennedy, who said \"We want to make crystal clear our feeling that the best way forward for America is to reelect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to four more years.\"\n\nCandidate Kennedy's beliefs about vaccines, the origins of COVID-19, and the assassinations of his father and uncle have attracted some supporters, including those who said they previously voted for Trump or Biden.\n\nIn recent weeks, Kennedy attracted the most media attention not for his positions on any political issue but for a revelation from a 2012 deposition for a divorce. In it, he said cognitive issues that had harmed his earning potential could have been \"caused by a worm that got into my brain and ate a portion of it and then died.\"\n\nIn a social media post after the brain worm wriggled into the headlines across the country, Kennedy quipped, \"I offer to eat 5 more brain worms and still beat President Trump and President Biden in a debate.\"\n\nPolitical pundits are split on whether Kennedy poses more of a threat to Trump or Biden.\n\n\"Kennedy is much more popular among Republicans than he is among Democrats right now. But that's probably mostly because he's a Democrat or former Democrat who says bad things about other Democrats,\" said Noel. \"And, so, Republicans like to hear that, and they think that sounds interesting. But they're not going to vote for that over Donald Trump.\"\n\nThe Republican National Committee, attempting to dissuade conservatives who oppose abortion from considering Kennedy as an alternative to Trump, stated, \"There is exactly zero daylight between the abortion extremism of RFK Jr. and Crooked Joe Biden.\"\n\nThe Democratic National Committee filed a complaint against Kennedy in February with the Federal Election Commission alleging a political action committee was illegally coordinating with the independent candidate's campaign to get him on additional state ballots.\n\nBiden's party also portrays Kennedy as a \"spoiler for Donald Trump,\" according to Matt Corridoni, a DNC spokesperson.\n\n\"RFK Jr.'s campaign isn't building a plan or a strategy to get 270 electoral votes. They're building one to help Trump return to the Oval Office,\" he says.\n\nThe New York Times calls Kennedy the \"X factor\" in this year's presidential election, noting that the latest public opinion survey, organized by the newspaper The Philadelphia Inquirer and Siena College, shows him polling stronger than any third-party candidate in decades. The poll has Kennedy being supported by about 10% of registered voters in the battleground states, drawing equally from both Biden and Trump.",

        "text": "Biden and Trump agree on debates on June 27 and in September\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump on Wednesday agreed to hold two campaign debates \u2014 the first on June 27 hosted by CNN and the second on Sept. 10 hosted by ABC \u2014 setting the stage for their first presidential face-off to play out in just over a month.\n\nThe quick agreement on the timetable followed the Democrat\u2019s announcement that he would not participate in fall presidential debates sponsored by the nonpartisan commission that has organized them for more than three decades. Biden\u2019s campaign instead proposed that media outlets directly organize the debates between the presumptive Democratic and Republican nominees.\n\nThe debate is so unusually early on the political calendar that neither Biden nor Trump will have formally accepted his party\u2019s nomination.\n\nHours later, Biden said he had accepted an invitation from CNN, adding, \u201cOver to you, Donald.\u201d Trump, who had insisted he would debate Biden anytime and anyplace, said on Truth Social he\u2019d be there, too, adding, \u201cLet\u2019s get ready to Rumble!!!\u201d Soon after that, they agreed to the second debate on ABC.\n\n\u201cTrump says he\u2019ll arrange his own transportation,\u201d Biden wrote on X, working in a jab about the perks of incumbency. \u201cI\u2019ll bring my plane, too. I plan on keeping it for another four years.\u201d\n\nThe swiftness with which the matchups came together reflects how each of the two unpopular candidates thinks he can get the better of his opponent in a head-to-head showdown. Trump and his team are convinced the debates will exacerbate voters\u2019 concerns about Biden\u2019s age and competence, while Biden\u2019s team believes Trump\u2019s often-incendiary rhetoric will remind voters of why they voted him out of the White House four years ago.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nThe presidential debates, always a critical moment on the political calendar, could be particularly important in a year when voters are underwhelmed with their choices and have expressed concerns about the candidates\u2019 advanced ages \u2014 Biden is 81 and Trump 77.\n\nSprightly on social media, the rivals traded barbs \u2014 each claiming victory the last time they faced off in 2020.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump lost two debates to me in 2020, since then he hasn\u2019t shown up for a debate,\u201d Biden said in a post on X. \u201cNow he\u2019s acting like he wants to debate me again. Well, make my day, pal.\u201d\n\nTrump, for his part, said Biden was the \u201cWORST debater I have ever faced - He can\u2019t put two sentences together!\u201d\n\nThe June debate is likely to cap a busy and unsettled stretch, following the likely conclusion of Trump\u2019s criminal hush money trial in New York, foreign trips by Biden to France and Italy, the end of the Supreme Court\u2019s term, and the expected start of two criminal trials for the president\u2019s son, Hunter Biden.\n\nCNN said that its debate would be held at 9 p.m. ET in its Atlanta studios with no audience present in a break from recent precedent. Moderators will be anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, CNN said. ABC did not offer details on where its event would be held, but the network said it would be moderated by anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis. Disagreements about moderators and rules were some of the questions that prompted the formation of the Commission on Presidential Debates in 1987.\n\nThe two campaigns and television networks had held weeks of informal talks on ways to circumvent the commission\u2019s grip on presidential debates following years of complaints and perceived slights, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke about internal discussions on condition of anonymity.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign had proposed excluding third-party candidates, such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr., from the debates outright. Under the debate commission\u2019s rules, Kennedy or other third-party candidates could qualify if they secured ballot access sufficient to claim 270 Electoral Votes and polled at 15% or higher in a selection of national surveys.\n\nBoth CNN and ABC announced the same qualification threshold, saying candidates will need to reach at least 15% in four separate national polls of registered or likely voters that meet their standards.\n\nIn response, Kennedy accused Biden and Trump of \u201ctrying to exclude me from their debate because they are afraid I would win.\u201d He said, \u201cKeeping viable candidates off the debate stage undermines democracy.\u201d\n\nThe debates will be the first televised general election matchups to be hosted by individual networks. The 1960 debates, which helped show the power of the medium to influence public opinion, were hosted jointly by the leading networks of the day. Before the commission was formed in 1987, the presidential debates of 1976, 1980 and 1984 were organized by the League of Women Voters.\n\nPlans for a vice presidential debate have yet to be announced.\n\nTrump has been pushing for more and earlier debates, arguing voters should be able to see the two men face off well before early voting begins in September. He has even proposed a debate outside the Manhattan courthouse where he is currently on trial. He also has been taunting Biden with an empty lectern at some of his rallies.\n\nIn a memorandum to Biden campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon on Wednesday, Trump senior campaign advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles challenged Biden to agree to at least two additional debates, suggesting one be held each month, with events in June, July, August and September, in addition to a vice presidential debate.\n\n\u201cAdditional dates will allow voters to have maximum exposure to the records and future visions of each candidate,\u201d they wrote.\n\nTrump later posted on Truth Social that he had agreed to a third debate, this one hosted by Fox.\n\n\u201cPlease let this TRUTH serve to represent that I hereby accept debating Crooked Joe Biden on FoxNews. The date will be Wednesday, October 2nd. The Hosts will be Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum. Thank you, DJT!\u201d he wrote.\n\nO\u2019Malley Dillon responded with a statement accusing Trump of having \u201ca long history of playing games with debates: complaining about the rules, breaking those rules, pulling out at the last minute, or not showing up at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo more games. No more chaos, no more debate about debates. We\u2019ll see Donald Trump on June 27th in Atlanta \u2013 if he shows up,\u201d she wrote.\n\nIn an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt Wednesday morning, Trump had raised his own doubts about whether Biden would show, and offered his own suggestions. He said the debates \u201cshould go two hours\u201d with both men standing, and he also pushed for larger venues.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just more exciting,\u201d he said.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign has long held a grudge against the nonpartisan commission, accusing it of failing to evenly apply its rules during the 2020 Biden-Trump matchups \u2014 most notably when it didn\u2019t enforce its COVID-19 testing rules on Trump and his entourage.\n\nAP AUDIO: Biden and Trump agree on debates in June and September, but working out details could be challenging AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports President Biden and Donald Trump appear to agree on holding a pair of debates.\n\nO\u2019Malley Dillon on Wednesday sent a letter to the Commission on Presidential Debates to say that Biden\u2019s campaign objected to its proposed debate dates in the fall, which would come after some Americans begin to vote, repeating a complaint also voiced by the Trump campaign. She also voiced frustrations over past rule violations and the commission\u2019s insistence on holding the debates before a live audience.\n\n\u201cThe debates should be conducted for the benefit of the American voters, watching on television and at home \u2014 not as entertainment for an in-person audience with raucous or disruptive partisans and donors,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThere also was little love lost for the commission from Trump, who objected to technical issues at his first debate with Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016 and was upset when a 2020 debate with Biden was canceled after the Republican came down with COVID-19. The Republican National Committee had already promised not to work with the commission on the 2024 contests.\n\nThe Trump campaign issued a statement on May 1 that said of the debate schedule offered by the commission: \u201cThis is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nThe commission said in a Wednesday statement, \u201cThe American public deserves substantive debates from the leading candidates for president and vice president.\u201d It said its mission is \u201cto ensure that such debates reliably take place and reach the widest television, radio and streaming audience.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow the AP\u2019s coverage of the 2024 election at https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024.",

        "text": "What we know, and don\u2019t know, about the presidential debates\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 After months of questions about whether general election debates would happen, President Joe Biden and Republican nominee Donald Trump have agreed to participate in two of them: one in June and one in September.\n\nBut there are still some nitty-gritty details to be worked out, including the formats of the events and who will moderate. Here\u2019s what we know so far:\n\nTHE DETAILS:\n\nTrump and Biden have agreed to two debates. The first will held at 9 pm. Eastern time on June 27 at CNN\u2019s studios in Atlanta, in a critical battleground state. \u201cTo ensure candidates may maximize the time allotted in the debate, no audience will be present,\u201d CNN said in a statement. To qualify, candidates must receive at least 15% in four national polls of registered or likely voters that meet CNN\u2019s standards.\n\nAnchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash would moderate the debate, CNN said.\n\nThe second debate will take place on Sept. 10 and will be hosted by ABC. While ABC has yet to detail where that debate will take place or the format, it set the same 15% polling threshold as CNN. Anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis will moderate that debate, the network said.\n\n\u201cIt is my great honor to accept the CNN Debate against Crooked Joe Biden,\u201d Trump posted on his Truth Social site. \u201cLikewise, I accept the ABC News Debate against Crooked Joe on September 10th.\u201d\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nBiden said he\u2019d done the same.\n\n\u201cTrump says he\u2019ll arrange his own transportation,\u201d Biden wrote on X. \u201cI\u2019ll bring my plane, too. I plan on keeping it for another four years.\u201d\n\nTHE TIMING\n\nThe first debate will play out in a jam-packed and unsettled political calendar, before either candidate becomes his party\u2019s official nominee at the summer conventions \u2014 scheduled to begin July 15 for Republicans and Aug. 19 for Democrats.\n\nThe June 27 match-up will come after the expected conclusion of Trump\u2019s criminal hush money trial in New York, foreign trips by Biden in mid-June to France and Italy, and the end of the Supreme Court\u2019s term. That term will include a ruling on whether Trump is immune from federal prosecution for his role in the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection. The debate will also come before the expected start of two criminal trials on opposite coasts for the president\u2019s son, Hunter.\n\nThe second debate would take place before most states begin early voting \u2014 though some overseas and military ballots may already be in the mail.\n\nSTICKING POINTS\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign is also pushing for more debates. In a memorandum Wednesday, senior campaign advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles sent a memo to Biden campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon saying, \u201cwe believe there should be more than just two opportunities for the American people to hear more from the candidates themselves.\u201d They proposed holding one debate per month, with events in June, July, August and September, in addition to a vice presidential debate.\n\n\u201cAdditional dates will allow voters to have maximum exposure to the records and future visions of each candidate,\u201d they wrote. Biden\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on the Trump team\u2019s push for additional match-ups.\n\nTrump has also expressed other preferences. In an interview Wednesday morning with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, he agreed the debates \u201cshould go two hours\u201d and also said he\u2019d prefer if the men stand instead of sit.\n\n\u201cA stand-up podium is important,\u201d he said, adding he thinks Biden wants to sit. He also said he would prefer the events take place in larger venues, before a live audience.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just more exciting,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Biden campaign outlined its own preferences in a letter Wednesday. It wants candidates\u2019 microphones muted when they aren\u2019t recognized to speak to promote \u201corderly proceeding,\u201d and it is opposed to live studio audiences.\n\n\u201cThe debates should be conducted for the benefit of the American voters, watching on television and at home \u2014 not as entertainment for an in-person audience with raucous or disruptive partisans and donors, who consume valuable debate time with noisy spectacles of approval or jeering,\u201d O\u2019Malley Dillon wrote.\n\nBiden\u2019s camp also argued third-party candidates should be excluded. \u201cThe debates should be one-on-one, allowing voters to compare the only two candidates with any statistical chance of prevailing in the Electoral College,\u201d O\u2019Malley Dillon wrote, \u201cnot squandering debate time on candidates with no prospect of becoming President.\u201d\n\nThere should also, she wrote, \u201cbe firm time limits for answers, and alternate turns to speak \u2014 so that the time is evenly divided and we have an exchange of views, not a spectacle of mutual interruption.\u201d\n\nDEBATE COMMISSION\n\nThe deal between the campaigns now sidelines the Commission on Presidential Debates, the nonpartisan group that has organized them for more than three decades. Both campaigns had expressed longstanding concerns about the commission\u2019s operations, with Trump blaming it for microphone issues during a debate in 2016 and Biden\u2019s campaign calling its plans \u201cout of step with changes in the structure of our elections and the interests of voters.\u201d\n\nBoth sides had taken particular issue with the dates the commission had announced, arguing the debates should happen earlier, before voting begins.\n\nIn a statement, the debates commission noted it had been \u201cestablished in 1987 specifically to ensure that such debates reliably take place and reach the widest television, radio and streaming audience. Our 2024 sites, all locations of higher learning, are prepared to host debates on dates chosen to accommodate early voters. We will continue to be ready to execute this plan.\u201d\n\nWHAT ABOUT OTHER NETWORKS?\n\nThe debates will be the first televised general election match-ups to be hosted by an individual news organization. The 1960 debates, which helped show the power of the medium to influence public opinion, were hosted jointly by the leading networks of the day, ABC, CBS and NBC. The presidential debates of 1976, 1980 and 1984 were organized by the League of Women Voters, and every debate since has been hosted by the Commission on Presidential Debates.\n\nTraditionally the debates are simulcast across all networks and other streaming outlets to reach the widest possible viewing audience. It was not yet clear whether the 2024 matchups would be shared similarly.\n\nThe Biden and Trump teams accepted the invitations from ABC and CNN after the Biden campaign proposed that the debates this year be hosted by any broadcast organization that hosted a Republican primary debate in 2016 and a Democratic primary debate in 2020. In that event, \u201cneither campaign can assert that the sponsoring organization is obviously unacceptable: if both candidates have previously debated on their airwaves, then neither could object to such venue.\u201d\n\nThose criteria would eliminate Fox News, which did not host a Democratic primary debate in 2020, and NBC News, which did not host a GOP one in 2016 \u2014 though its corporate affiliates CNBC and Telemundo were co-hosts of one debate each that year.\n\nTrump has said he accepted a debate invitation in October from Fox News, though Biden\u2019s team dismissed it as \u201cplaying games.\u201d\n\nHOW WILL THEY PREPARE\n\nBoth Biden and Trump are expected to engage in intensive preparation sessions before the debates. Former Biden chief of staff Ron Klain, who now works at Airbnb, told the AP he will use vacation time to help Biden get ready to face off with Trump. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who helped Trump prepare for previous debates, seems unlikely to reprise the role, having suffered a falling out with the presumptive GOP nominee.\n\nWHAT ABOUT THIRD PARTY CANDIDATES?\n\nIt is unclear whether any third party candidates will qualify for the debates, but both CNN and ABC\u2019s criteria appear to pose an challenge for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. He railed against the plan on X on Wednesday, accusing Trump and Biden of \u201ccolluding to lock America into a head-to-head match-up that 70% say they do not want.\n\n\u201cThey are trying to exclude me from their debate because they are afraid I would win,\u201d he wrote. \u201cKeeping viable candidates off the debate stage undermines democracy.\u201d\n\nIn addition to their polling requirements, both CNN and ABC said that in order to qualify, a candidate\u2019s name must appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to qualify that person to reach 270 electoral college votes.\n\nSo far, Kennedy has qualified for the general election ballot in three states -- California, Michigan and Utah, according to AP Elections Research. He is listed as an independent or minor party candidate in eight more states, but hasn\u2019t yet qualified for the ballot in them. They are Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire and North Carolina. Those 11 states have a combined 123 electoral college votes, meaning he would need to get on the ballot in additional states in order to qualify.\n\n___ Colvin reported from New York.",

        "text": "Don\u2019t panic about presidential polls \u2013 yet\nHello! Welcome back to our new US elections newsletter.\n\nNon-Trump supporters have been all jittery this week, after a poll appeared to show Joe Biden getting royally stuffed by Trump in the election.\n\nThe poll had Trump leading Biden in six of the seven states that are key to becoming president. It might seem scary, yes, but it\u2019s too soon to be completely terrified: we\u2019ll look at why in a little bit.\n\nFirst, some of the happenings in US politics.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know \u2026\n\n1. Trump is (still) in court\n\nSummer is almost here in New York. The bees are out, the birds are singing. And Michael Cohen is singing, too! Cohen, who spent a decade as Trump\u2019s lawyer and hatchet man, has been telling a Manhattan court how he paid Stormy Daniels, an adult film actor, to keep quiet about her alleged affair with Trump. Cohen said he did so at the direction of Trump, to help his chances of winning the 2016 election. That\u2019s a crime, which wouldn\u2019t bode well for Trump\u2019s re-election chances.\n\n2. Mixed primary results for Republicans\n\nBarring the unprecedented, Joe Biden and Donald Trump will be the Democratic and Republican candidates in November \u2013 but the presidential primaries are still going on, and sometimes they tell us interesting things. Like in Maryland and Nebraska, for example, where on Tuesday about 20% of Republicans voted for Nikki Haley \u2013 who dropped out of the presidential race in March \u2013 over Trump. It suggests the former-president has some wooing to do to win over Republicans.\n\n3. Will tariffs excite voters?\n\nTariffs are not the sexiest thing a president can announce. But Biden will be hoping they have some impact, after he increased tariffs \u2013 essentially the amount of taxes a country has to pay to sell its goods \u2013 on a number of Chinese imports. The new tariffs affect steel and aluminium, which are traditionally important products in places like Pennsylvania and Michigan. He also jacked up tariffs on electric vehicles, in a move the White House says will protect jobs.\n\nDon\u2019t panic \u2026 at least not yet\n\nView image in fullscreen Joe Biden (left) in Wilmington, North Carolina, on 2 May 2024, and Donald Trump in Waukesha, Wisconsin, on 1 May 2024. Photograph: Alex Brandon/AP\n\nMonday mornings are rarely enjoyable, but for people concerned about a second Trump term, this week\u2019s was worse than usual. \u201cTrump Leads in 5 Key States,\u201d blared a New York Times headline, \u201cAs Young and Nonwhite Voters Express Discontent With Biden.\u201d\n\nThis newsletter isn\u2019t usually about polling and numbers and abacuses: it\u2019s called the Stakes, not the Odds. But bear with me, because it is worth taking a look at the New York Times/Siena College poll that prompted that headline \u2013 and hundreds of scary follow-up stories by other media outlets.\n\nThe newspaper knocked up a graphic that shows Biden down in Nevada by 12 points; in Georgia by 10 points; and by seven points in both Arizona and Michigan. Biden was also behind in Pennsylvania, but had a small lead in Wisconsin.\n\nMost states vote very predictably: New York has been Democratic for ages; Alabama, Republican. But these five are swing states \u2013 ones that Biden and Trump both have a shot at winning. Each candidate would need to win some combination of swing states to take the White House.\n\nNot very good for Democrats, eh? But how much should they really be worried?\n\nMaybe not as much as you may think. For one thing, those terrifying numbers were a result of asking registered voters how they planned to vote.\n\nBut not every registered voter actually votes: some aren\u2019t excited about the candidates, others just can\u2019t be bothered. In 2020, 168 million people were registered to vote. Only 158m actually did.\n\nThis is important because when the New York Times questioned people who said they were likely to vote \u2013 not just registered \u2013 the results became much closer.\n\nAmong these people who are planning to vote, Biden is actually slightly ahead in Michigan (as opposed to being seven points behind). He is still slightly behind in Pennsylvania, and one point behind in Wisconsin, but well within the margin of error. (That\u2019s another thing: these polls are only accurate to within plus or minus 3.5%.)\n\nSo in Michigan, in Pennsylvania \u2013 where Biden grew up \u2013 and in Wisconsin, the race is essentially too close to call. And that\u2019s important, because if Biden can win these three states, that should be enough to get him re-elected.\n\nIn the 2016 presidential election, a lot of journalists and news outlets convinced themselves Trump was going to lose in large part from looking at polls. Of course, everyone got it wrong.\n\nThat prompted all sorts of hand-wringing among the press. In the future, there would be less focus on single polls. Everyone would report on issues instead. As is often the case with the (pretty self-serious) American media, noble think pieces were written, apologies were issued.\n\nYet it feels like we\u2019re back at it again: one poll, being reported on, again and again, scaring the hell out of everybody.\n\nI have nothing against polls. I listen to the FiveThirtyEight podcast, which bases its political analysis almost exclusively on polling. They can also tell us useful things about how different people feel \u2013 for example, that young people are less enthusiastic about Biden than they were in 2020, while some Black voters also appear to be drifting away from the president.\n\nBut as Leah Askarinam, a reporter at AP, told that podcast this week: \u201cThese are helpful numbers. [But] it is six months away from the election.\u201d\n\nAskarinam added: \u201cThese polls are not telling us who is winning and who is losing right now.\u201d So nobody should get all in a tizzy just yet.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMichael Cohen is the key witness in Trump\u2019s ongoing criminal trial, but not everyone will know who he is. Well, Cohen worked for Trump from 2006 to 2018 as his personal attorney \u2013 but Cohen was really Trump\u2019s attack dog: charged with going after anyone who upset his boss.\n\nCohen was known to a lot of reporters as a shouty, sweary menace, and I thought it was worth sharing with you my own brush with him, in 2012.\n\nTrump \u2013 at that time, just a loudmouth reality TV star \u2013 had demanded that Barack Obama publish his passport records, claiming Obama had not been born in the US. I thought it would be amusing to call Trump Tower and ask whether Trump would publish his own records.\n\nI got Cohen, who found it less amusing, and quickly became upset. He accused me of \u201ctrying to be funny\u201d (fair), called my request \u201cstupid\u201d (bit mean), said Trump would release his passport records if I sent him mine (!), asked me to donate $5m to charity (!!), then hung up on me.\n\nI never did get Trump\u2019s passport records, and I never heard from Cohen again, but happily, I recorded our conversation.\n\nWho had the worst week?\n\nView image in fullscreen Rudy Giuliani outside the White House in Washington DC on 1 July 2020. Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nRudy Giuliani. The man who led New York through the 9/11 attacks, then went from America\u2019s mayor to America\u2019s weirdo in what felt like the blink of an eye, Giuliani lost what was left of his reputation during Trump\u2019s presidency \u2013 particularly through a doomed attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election, which reached its nadir when he hosted a press conference at a landscaping business located between a crematorium and sex shop.\n\nThings have gone from bad to worse since then. In December last year, Giuliani was ordered to pay $148.1m to two election workers after he lied about them. Then he filed for bankruptcy.\n\nThis week, his radio show was canceled because he wouldn\u2019t stop lying about the 2020 election. He\u2019s also having to sell his apartment.\n\nBorn to lie\n\nView image in fullscreen Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Wildwood, New Jersey, on 11 May 2024. Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nDonald Trump wishes he was the Boss \u2013 or at least that he drew the same crowds and loyalty in New Jersey. At a rally over the weekend, Trump claimed to have a \u201cmuch bigger crowd\u201d than Bruce Springsteen.\n\nThe city of Wildwood estimated Trump\u2019s attendance at 80,000. Trump claimed 100,000. But the city previously said the event\u2019s capacity was just 20,000. Radio station New Jersey 101.5 reported that the city and Trump\u2019s claims of crowd size are \u201cwildly overestimated\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, according to the local Asbury Park Press, Springsteen drew about 180,000 people across three shows the last time he played a stadium in his home state.\n\nSpringsteen has called the former president\u2019s time in office \u201ca fucking nightmare\u201d and campaigned for Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\n- Rachel Leingang, misinformation reporter\n\nElsewhere in US politics\n\nView image in fullscreen Donald Trump (left) and Joe Biden in the final presidential debate at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee, on 22 October 2020. Composite: Chip Somodevilla/AP\n\n\u201cA split has emerged in the Never Trump movement in the Republican party,\u201d says David Smith, with some of the Trump-averse Republicans no longer bold or brave enough to not vote for the former president.\n\nBlue-collar voters have lined up increasingly behind Trump, Steven Greenhouse writes, but experts say Biden can win them back.\n\nRepublicans could flip a Senate seat in Maryland in November, which would not be good news for Democrats, explains Joan E Greve.\n\nWords fail us",

        "text": "Joe Biden and Donald Trump agree to two US presidential debates\nShortly after the Biden-Harris re-election campaign proposed two TV debates between Joe Biden and Donald Trump ahead of November\u2019s presidential vote, both men have agreed upon two debate dates: 27 June and 10 September.\n\nCNN confirmed that it would host the first debate of 2024 on that date at 9pm ET from the crucial battleground state of Georgia.\n\nABC later confirmed they\u2019d host a second debate on 10 September during prime time.\n\nA third date, 2 October, has been proposed by Trump in a Truth Social post on Wednesday afternoon: \u201cLet this TRUTH serve to represent that I hereby accept debating Crooked Joe Biden on FoxNews. The date will be Wednesday, October 2nd. The Hosts will be Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum. Thank you, DJT!\u201d\n\nChris LaCivita and Susie Wiles, with the Trump campaign, told ABC News of the upcoming and pending debate dates: \u201cWe propose a debate in June, a debate in July, a debate in August, and a debate in September, in addition to the Vice Presidential debate. Additional dates will allow voters to have maximum exposure to the records and future visions of each candidate.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Biden said in a video shared on social media: \u201cDonald Trump lost two debates to me in 2020, and since then he hasn\u2019t shown up for a debate. Now he\u2019s acting like he wants to debate me again. Well, make my day, pal. I\u2019ll even do it twice.\u201d\n\nHe then jabbed: \u201cSo let\u2019s pick dates, Donald. I hear you\u2019re free on Wednesdays,\u201d referring to the free day in Trump\u2019s current campaign finance violations trial in New York.\n\nIn a post on Twitter/X, independent candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr accused Biden and Trump of \u201ccolluding to lock America into a head-to-head match-up that 70% say they do not want. They are trying to exclude me from their debate because they are afraid I would win. Keeping viable candidates off the debate stage undermines democracy.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s proposal bucked a tradition of three debates, typically held in the fall, that are organized by the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates. Democratic party officials said in a release on Wednesday that moving the timing up, reducing the number of debates and ending them sooner reflected changes in the \u201cstructure of our elections and the interests of voters\u201d.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 proposal also noted that debates in previous elections cycles had not concluded until after early voting started and the commission\u2019s debates were \u201cstructured like an entertainment spectacle and not a serious exchange of ideas that reflect the enormous stakes of the election\u201d.\n\nThe commission \u201chas consistently demonstrated an inability to enforce their own rules\u201d in the debates and called for a firm time limit on answers, and alternate turns to speak \u201cso that the time is evenly divided and we have an exchange of views, not a spectacle of mutual interruption\u201d.\n\nLater on Wednesday morning, Trump accepted Biden\u2019s offer to debate him in June and September, telling Fox News Digital that \u201cit is time for a debate to take place \u2013 even if it has to be held through the offices of the Commission on Presidential Debates, which are totally controlled by Democrats and who, as people remember, got caught cheating with me with debate sound levels\u201d.\n\nHe added on Truth Social: \u201cCrooked Joe Biden is the worst debater I have ever faced \u2013 he can\u2019t put two sentences together.\u201d\n\nThat missive concluded with Trump saying: \u201cI would strongly recommend more than two debates and, for excitement purposes, a very large venue, although Biden is supposedly afraid of crowds \u2013 That\u2019s only because he doesn\u2019t get them. Just tell me when, I\u2019ll be there. Let\u2019s get ready to Rumble!!!\u201d\n\nBiden volleyed back with a message on X shortly after Trump\u2019s various remarks, saying he was up \u201cfor a debate on June 27th. Over to you, Donald. As you said: anywhere, any time, any place.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve received and accepted an invitation from @CNN for a debate on June 27th. Over to you, Donald. As you said: anywhere, any time, any place. \u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) May 15, 2024\n\nArranging the presidential debates has become increasingly vexed, with both parties seeking a competitive advantage.

But even the Democrats\u2019 proposal on Wednesday was designed for point-scoring.\n\n\u201cAs Donald Trump has said he will debate \u2018anytime, anywhere\u2019, we hope both campaigns can quickly accept broadcast media debate invitations on the parameters above,\u201d the Biden campaign chair, Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon, wrote in a letter to the commission before Trump\u2019s acceptance of the challenge. \u201cAmericans need a debate on the issues \u2013 not a tedious debate about debates.\u201d\n\nThe Biden campaign had said it would work directly with news organizations to set up the debates, sidelining the debating commission which has overseen them since 1988. In CNN\u2019s press release announcing the 27 June debate, the news organization noted it would take place \u201cin CNN\u2019s Atlanta studios\u201d and \u201cno audience will be present\u201d.\n\nUntil now, there has been uncertainty about whether Biden would agree to debate Trump at all. Trump skipped every Republican primary debate, pointing to his polling lead in that selection process, and Biden refused to debate his Democratic challengers.\n\nTrump, who has polling leads in five of six crucial swing states, has goaded Biden often, saying last month he was willing to debate his rival \u201canytime, anywhere, any place\u201d, starting \u201cnow\u201d.\n\nThe Trump campaign called for presidential debates to be held earlier and more frequently so voters \u201chave a full chance\u201d to see the candidates in action and argued that by the time of the first scheduled debate, on 16 September, more than 1 million Americans will probably have already voted, with more than 8.7 million voting by the third debate, penciled in for 9 October.\n\nLast month, 12 US news organizations issued pleas to the campaigns to agree to TV debate schedule.\n\n\u201cIf there is one thing Americans can agree on during this polarized time, it is that the stakes of this election are exceptionally high,\u201d the organizations including ABC, CBS, CNN, Fox News, PBS, NBC, NPR and the Associated Press said in a statement.\n\n\u201cAmidst that backdrop, there is simply no substitute for the candidates debating with each other, and before the American people, their visions for the future of our nation,\u201d they added.\n\nIn 2020, Biden and Trump debated twice, with a third debate canceled after Trump tested positive for Covid-19.",

        "text": "7 Things You May Not Know About US Presidential Debates\nWhile presidential debates may seem like a given each election season, the tradition began relatively recently in American history. The 1960 Kennedy-Nixon debates carried a major impact on the election\u2019s outcome and introduced a new era of politics that emphasized public image and media exposure. Below are seven surprising facts about the history of U.S. presidential debates.\n\nThe Kennedy-Nixon Debate\n\n1. The history of presidential debates is surprisingly short.\n\nIn the early years of the United States, presidential candidates considered it unseemly to campaign, let alone debate their opponents. Not until Democratic Senator John F. Kennedy and Republican Vice President Richard Nixon met in a Chicago television studio on September 26, 1960, did the major parties\u2019 nominees square off.\n\nDespite the enormous audiences for the Kennedy-Nixon encounters, 16 years would go by before the next series of presidential debates. President Lyndon Johnson refused to debate in 1964, while Nixon did the same in 1968 and 1972.\n\n2. The first presidential debates required an act of Congress.\n\nThe Communications Act of 1934 required that American broadcasters offer all candidates for public office\u2014not just those from the major parties\u2014equal time on air. In order to legally permit the 1960 presidential debates to be limited solely to Kennedy and Nixon, Congress temporarily suspended that provision of the law. A 1975 revision by the Federal Communications Commission allowed presidential debates between the major party nominees to be staged without special acts of Congress.\n\n3. At one presidential debate, the candidates were separated by nearly 3,000 miles.\n\nWhen Kennedy and Nixon appeared for their third debate of the 1960 campaign, they didn\u2019t share the same time zone, let alone the same stage. Both men appeared behind podiums in similar-looking television studios, Kennedy in New York City and Nixon in Hollywood, California. The moderator and three panelists sat in a third television studio. The good news for the candidates: no awkward handshake or forced smiles necessary at the end of the encounter.\n\n4. During one debate, the candidates stood silently for nearly half an hour.\n\nWith just nine minutes remaining in the first debate between President Gerald Ford and Democratic challenger Jimmy Carter on September 23, 1976, the audio suddenly failed. On ABC, anchor Harry Reasoner assured viewers the technical difficulties were \u201cnot a conspiracy against Governor Carter or President Ford.\u201d\n\nFor 27 minutes, as the nation watched and audio engineers scrambled, the two candidates appeared frozen in place as they stood stiffly in silence behind their podiums. \u201cI suspect both of us would have liked to sit down and relax while the technicians were fixing the system,\u201d Ford recounted to PBS newsman Jim Lehrer, \u201cbut I think both of us were hesitant to make any gesture that might look like we weren\u2019t physically or mentally able to handle a problem like this.\u201d\n\n5. A president was once a debate no-show.\n\nIn 1980, President Carter believed three was a crowd and refused to participate in any debate that included both Republican nominee Ronald Reagan and independent candidate John Anderson, so the incumbent was missing when his two opponents took to the stage on September 21, 1980.\n\nAs the wrangling continued, the vice presidential debate and the second scheduled presidential debate were cancelled. Finally, just a week before Election Day, Carter had a one-on-one debate with his Republican rival in which Reagan uttered two phrases that quickly entered the political lexicon: \u201cThere you go again\u201d and \u201cAre you better off than you were four years ago?\u201d\n\n6. The 2016 debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump was the most-watched in history.\n\nAccording to Nielsen Media Research, 84 million Americans tuned in on September 26, 2016 to watch Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump square off in their first debate. The tally didn't even include those who watched on the internet, mobile devices or on C-Span, none of which were rated by Nielsen. The 2016 numbers exceeded the previous debate audience record of 80.6 million set in 1980 when President Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan debated for the first and only time. The third-most watched presidential debate was the September 29, 2020 event between Joseph Biden and Donald Trump, drawing 73 million viewers.\n\nReagan and Carter in 1980 Presidential Debate\n\n7. Broadcast networks haven\u2019t always considered the debates \u201cmust-see TV.\u201d\n\nThe fall campaign always clashes with two other popular American pastimes\u2014baseball and the new TV season\u2014and politics, even the presidential debates, doesn\u2019t always win out for air time. In past years, contractual obligations have required networks to broadcast baseball playoff games instead of the debates. In 2000, many NBC stations aired baseball in place of two of the three debates, and Fox even chose to bypass a debate in order to air the premier of \u201cDark Angel,\u201d a science fiction series co-created by director James Cameron and starring Jessica Alba.",

        "text": "When Are the 2024 Presidential Debates?\nPresident Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump have accepted invitations to debate live on television at least twice before the Nov. 5 election, giving voters a chance to hear from both presidential candidates side-by-side well before early voting begins.\n\nThe first debate will be hosted by CNN on June 27 and the second will be hosted by ABC on Sept. 10, marking the first set of onstage clashes between the former President and his successor in more than three years.\n\nThe June debate is set to be the earliest general-election debate in modern history\u2014a move both candidates support in order to reach early voters who were crucial to Biden\u2019s 2020 election win. Additional debates, which the Trump campaign is calling for, could be announced later in the election cycle.\n\nMost national polls show Trump and Biden within one point of each other, suggesting the debates could play a pivotal role in shaping public opinion and potentially influencing the outcome of the election. A recent poll from The New York Times found that Trump is leading in five out of six swing states, and that more voters trust Trump over Biden to handle the economy.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., an independent candidate who is polling around 9.5% nationally, did not qualify for the first debate with Biden and Trump, though he could end up on the debate stage for the second debate if his polling improves to 15% and he appears on more state ballots. He criticized the networks\u2019 decision to exclude him for now, writing on social media that the frontrunners are \u201ccolluding\u201d to keep him off the debate stage \u201cbecause they are afraid I would win.\u201d\n\nHere are the details about the scheduled presidential debates.\n\nJune 27, CNN\n\nThe first presidential debate will be held on June 27 in CNN\u2019s Atlanta studios, and there will be several rule changes, including no audience present and muted microphones.\n\nThe debate will start at 9 p.m. ET and the moderators will be Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, CNN announced. For the first time in recent history, the debate will feature two commercial breaks during the 90-minute broadcast, a departure from past commission-hosted events which did not include corporate advertisements.\n\nRead More: These Are the Rules of the CNN Presidential Debate\n\nThe decision to scrap the live audience format\u2014a staple of nearly every presidential debate since 1976\u2014comes after the Biden campaign argued that in-person crowds that cheer and boo can derail the conversation. Trump pushed back on the format, saying that he would prefer \u201cfor excitement purposes, a very large venue, although Biden is supposedly afraid of crowds.\u201d\n\nThe new rules also include measures such as muted microphones to ensure each candidate's uninterrupted speaking time, no opening statements, and no notes allowed.\n\nCNN said that in order to qualify for its debate, candidates must \u201cappear on a sufficient number of state ballots to reach the 270 electoral vote threshold to win the presidency and receive at least 15% in four separate national polls of registered or likely voters that meet CNN\u2019s standards for reporting.\u201d According to CNN, Kennedy fell just shy of those benchmarks. The network said he has received at least 15% in three qualifying polls so far and is currently on the ballot in six states, which makes him eligible for 89 Electoral College votes.\n\nSeptember 10, ABC News\n\nBiden and Trump will meet again on Sept. 10 for a presidential debate hosted by ABC News. It\u2019s unclear if there will be an audience and what time the debate will begin, though the network said it would be held during \u201cprime time.\u201d\n\nDavid Muir and Linsey Davis will moderate the debate, the network announced. The debate will air on ABC News, ABC News Live, and Hulu\u2014and will also be simulcast on additional broadcast and streaming news networks, ABC said.\n\nLike the CNN debate, in order to qualify for the ABC debate candidates must be polling above 15% in four separate national polls and appear on a sufficient number of state ballots, leaving open the possibility that Kennedy could end up on the debate stage if his polling improves and he makes it on the ballot in more states by the fall.\n\nTo be determined: vice-presidential debate\n\nA vice-presidential debate is also expected to take place before early voting begins in September, with both campaigns expressing interest in a debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and the soon-to-be-announced Trump running mate.\n\nThe Biden campaign said on May 16 that it had accepted an invitation from CBS News to participate in a vice-presidential debate on either July 23 or Aug. 13.",

As you said: anywhere, any time, any place,\u201d he wrote.\n\nLater, Trump said on his Truth social platform that it was his \u201cgreat honor\u201d to accept the CNN debate invitation.\n\nThe presumptive Democratic and Republican presidential nominees also said they had agreed to a second debate on September 10, to be hosted by ABC News.\n\nThe announcements came just hours after Biden challenged Trump to two debates before November\u2019s election but said he would bypass a traditional debate schedule set by a bipartisan commission.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump lost two debates to me in 2020, and since then, he hasn\u2019t shown up to a debate,\u201d Biden said in a video posted online earlier in the day. \u201cNow he\u2019s acting like he wants to debate me again. Well, make my day, pal. I\u2019ll even do it twice.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump lost two debates to me in 2020. Since then, he hasn\u2019t shown up for a debate. Now he\u2019s acting like he wants to debate me again. Well, make my day, pal. pic.twitter.com/AkPmvs2q4u \u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) May 15, 2024\n\nBiden had called on Trump to join him for two televised presidential debates in June and September.\n\nHis proposal, outlined in a letter and a video, called for direct negotiations between the Trump and Biden campaigns over the rules, network hosts and moderators for the one-on-one meetings.\n\nTrump responded swiftly, writing on his Truth Social media platform earlier on Wednesday that he was \u201cReady and Willing to Debate Crooked Joe\u201d on the proposed dates.\n\n\u201cI would strongly recommend more than two debates and, for excitement purposes, a very large venue, although Biden is supposedly afraid of crowds \u2013 That\u2019s only because he doesn\u2019t get them,\u201d Trump wrote.\n\n\u201cJust tell me when, I\u2019ll be there. \u2018Let\u2019s get ready to Rumble!!!'\u201d\n\nMost polls show a tight race between Biden and Trump ahead of the election on November 5.\n\nExperts say the contest will likely come down to how the candidates fare in critical swing states, such as Michigan, Georgia and Nevada.\n\nBut there is also widespread frustration that the choice this election cycle is the same as in 2020 when Biden defeated the then-incumbent Trump to win the White House.\n\nA recent Pew Research Center poll found nearly half of all registered voters said they would replace both Biden and Trump on the ballot if they could.\n\nAbout two-thirds of respondents said they had little to no confidence that Biden is physically fit enough to be president while a similar number said they did not believe Trump would act ethically in office.\n\n\u201cIt is Election 2.0,\u201d Jan Leighley, a political science professor at American University in Washington, DC, told Al Jazeera this month.\n\n\u201cI think that creates a disincentive for voting, which again comes back on the campaigns to convince people that, even though it\u2019s the same choice, there\u2019s still a reason to vote.\u201d\n\nBoth candidates also face serious challenges before the election.\n\nTrump is currently in court on accusations he falsified business documents to conceal hush money payments made to an adult film star \u2013 one of four criminal indictments against the former president.\n\nBiden, for his part, has faced widespread criticism and public anger for his support of Israel during the Gaza war with key segments of his Democratic Party base saying they would not vote for him if he doesn\u2019t change his stance.\n\nTrump, who refused to debate his rivals in the Republican primary race, has in recent weeks been challenging Biden to engage in a one-on-one match-up, offering to debate the Democrat \u201canytime, anywhere, anyplace\u201d.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Biden campaign explained its decision to eschew the traditional debate schedule in a letter to the Commission on Presidential Debates, a nonprofit that has sponsored US presidential debates since 1988.\n\n\u201cThe Commission\u2019s schedule has debates that begin after the American people have a chance to cast their vote early, and doesn\u2019t conclude until after tens of millions of Americans will have already voted,\u201d the campaign wrote.\n\nIt also said the commission\u2019s model of holding debates with large, in-person audiences \u201csimply isn\u2019t necessary or conducive to good debates\u201d.",

THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TONIGHT AT 10:00. I\u2019M ANDRE HEPKINS AND I\u2019M ASHLEY HINSON POLLS HAVE OFFICIALLY CLOSED IN THE 2024 MARYLAND PRIMARY. AND RIGHT NOW WE ARE WATCHING SEVERAL BIG RACES, INCLUDING THE RACE TO REPLACE BEN CARDIN IN THE US SENATE AND IN THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY. THE AP HAS JUST CALLED PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY EXECUTIVE ANGELA ALSOBROOKS AS THE WINNER. SHE BEAT CURRENT CONGRESSMAN DAVID TRONE THERE WITH 53% OF THE VOTE, 40% REPORTING, AND ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, FORMER GOVERNOR LARRY HOGAN HAS ALREADY BEEN DECLARED THE WINNER OF THAT PRIMARY, WITH 62% OF THE VOTE. ALSO, LET\u2019S GO TO THE BALTIMORE CITY MAYOR\u2019S RACE. WE ARE WATCHING THE TOP THREE CANDIDATES IN THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY. THEY ARE NOT STRANGERS TO THIS RACE RIGHT NOW. INCUMBENT MAYOR BRANDON SCOTT, WITH. 46% OF THE VOTE. FORMER MAYOR SHEILA DIXON WITH 44% AND BUSINESSMAN BOB WALLACE WITH 3% OF THE VOTE WITH 28% OF THE VOTES BEING COUNTED RIGHT NOW, 11 NEWS HAS CREWS SPREAD ACROSS THE STATE OF MARYLAND TONIGHT AS THESE RESULTS START TO TRICKLE IN. TOMMIE CLARKE IS WITH THE BRANDON SCOTT CAMPAIGN. KAI REED IS AT THE SHEILA DIXON WATCH PARTY IN KHIREE STEWART IS KEEPING AN EYE ON THE RACE FOR CITY COUNCIL PRESIDENT, BUT WE WANT TO START WITH THAT U.S. SENATE RACE. DAVID COLLINS IS WITH THE TRONE CAMPAIGN, BUT WE KICK THINGS OFF WITH KATE AMARA. SHE IS LIVE IN GREENBELT. AND KATE, YOU HAVE BEEN WITH ANGELA ALSO BROOKS MOST OF THE DAY. YES. AND IN THE LAST MINUTE STUFF IS HAPPENING HERE. THE ASSOCIATED PRESS CALLED THE RACE FOR ANGELA ALSOBROOKS ON TWITTER. ALSO, BROOKS DECLARED HERSELF. THE WINNER AND WE BELIEVE THAT EITHER. ALSO BROOKS OR ONE OF HER SURROGATES HAS JUST COME DOWN INTO TO THIS BANQUET HALL WHERE THIS WATCH PARTY IS BEING HELD. IT\u2019S EITHER THAT WE CAN\u2019T QUITE SEE OVER ALL THESE HEADS OR SOME OF HER VERY CLOSE SURROGATES, AND WE\u2019RE STARTING TO SEE PEOPLE FILTER INTO THE BALLROOM HERE, ALTHOUGH THERE HAS NOT BEEN AN ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE AP HAS CALLED THIS RACE, THERE\u2019S NO NEWS OR ANYTHING BEING PUT UP ON THESE BIG SCREENS. BUT FROM WHAT WE CAN TELL HERE, SOMETHING IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN. WE DO KNOW THAT UNTIL THIS MOMENT, THE CAMPAIGN, THE STAFFERS, THE SUPPORTERS WERE FEELING VERY GOOD, OFFICIALLY DESCRIBED AS CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC, THEY OVERPERFORMED IN THE VERY EARLY THE FIRST WAVE OF THE MAIL IN VOTES THAT CAME IN, THEY WERE WINNING THE EARLY TOTALS, EARLY VOTING TOTALS, AND THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY WILL WIN THE ELECTION DAY TOTALS AS WELL. IT DOES LOOK LIKE STEVE, CAN YOU TELL WHO\u2019S UP BACK THERE? CONGRESSMAN IVEY, CONGRESSMAN IVEY IS ANGELA ALSO BROOKS BACK THERE? IS THAT WHAT THIS BIG FUSS IS ABOUT? IS? NO. OKAY. THAT\u2019S HE CAN\u2019T HEAR ME. NOBODY CAN HEAR ANYTHING THAT\u2019S GOING ON RIGHT NOW. BUT THIS IS A ROOM THAT IS CELEBRATING. AND I THINK THEY\u2019RE ABOUT IT\u2019S ABOUT TO GET VERY LOUD IN HERE AGAIN. THE ASSOCIATE PRESS CALLED THE RACE FOR ANGELA ALSOBROOKS. SHE HAS DECLARED HERSELF THE WINNER. THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE FOR US SENATE. AND FROM WHAT WE SEE HERE, WE ARE EXPECTING SOMEBODY TO COME TO THE PODIUM SOON. WE\u2019LL SEND IT BACK TO YOU. ON. NOW, ALL THE PARTY INGREDIENTS ARE HERE. THERE\u2019S GREAT FOOD, GOOD COMPANY. ALL THAT\u2019S MISSING IS A CELEBRATION. KHERSON. TAKE A LOOK AT THE NUMBERS. AND THAT\u2019S PART OF THE REASON WHY. NOW WE\u2019RE WITH TOM MERONEK. HE\u2019S AN ATTORNEY AND STRONG SUPPORTER OF DAVID TRONE, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS IS CALLING THE RACE FOR ANGELA ALSOBROOKS. WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO THAT? I THINK IT\u2019S SO EARLY. THERE\u2019S A LOT OF PRECINCTS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN COUNTED YET. SO I THINK THERE\u2019S STILL TIME. BUT OBVIOUSLY THAT\u2019S SOMETHING THAT\u2019S CONCERNING. NOW, WORD OF WHAT THE AP IS FORECAST HERE HAS NOT SPREAD ACROSS THIS ROOM. SO WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE THAT ANGELA ALSO BROOKS IS BEING CALLED THE WINNER BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. READ THE ROOM FOR US. I THINK PEOPLE ARE NERVOUS. I THINK THEY\u2019RE WAITING TO SEE WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN. AND OBVIOUSLY THEY\u2019RE LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS AND HOPING THINGS WILL PICK UP. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. TOM RODDICK\u2019S ATTORNEY AND STRONG SUPPORTER OF DAVID TRONE. ACCORDING TO THE CAMPAIGN, DAVID TRONE IS EXPECTED TO SPEAK AROUND 1030 TONIGHT. NO MATTER WHAT. AND THEY ARE ANTICIPATING STILL, EVEN THOUGH SOME OF THE NUMBERS DON\u2019T LOOK IN HIS FAVOR, A LONG NIGHT OF COUNTING BACK TO YOU. ALL RIGHT, DAVID, THANK YOU. AND LOOKING TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE, FORMER GOVERNOR LARRY HOGAN HAS ALREADY BEEN DECLARED THE WINNER OF THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY. THIS IS A LIVE LOOK HERE IN AT LARRY HOGAN\u2019S CAMPAIGN PARTY TONIGHT IN ANNAPOLIS. LOOKS LIKE THEY\u2019RE WRAPPING THINGS UP QUICKLY. THEY\u2019VE BEEN CELEBRATING THERE THOUGH SINCE THAT RACE WAS CALLED AROUND 830 TONIGHT. UH, HOGAN ENTERED THIS RACE FAIRLY LATE IN THE GAME, BUT BEGAN POLLING WELL WITH VOTERS ALMOST AS SOON AS HE ANNOUNCED. AND HERE\u2019S HIS REACTION TO THE WIN. JUST A SHORT TIME AGO. WE\u2019VE ALWAYS BEEN AN UNDERDOG. THEY\u2019VE ALWAYS COUNTED US OUT. BUT EVERY SINGLE TIME TOGETHER WE HAVE BEATEN THE ODDS. VOTE FOR ME TO SEND A STRONG, INDEPENDENT LEADER WHO WILL STAND UP AND FIGHT TO CLEAN UP THE MESS IN WASHINGTON. AND WHILE HE\u2019S BEEN CELEBRATING A WIN TONIGHT, THE RACE IS FAR FROM OVER. HOGAN\u2019S CAMPAIGN HAS CONSISTENTLY TOLD US THAT HE FEELS HE IS THE UNDERDOG CANDIDATE IN THE GENERAL ELECTION. AND BACK HERE IN BALTIMORE, WHERE WE\u2019RE KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON THE RACE FOR MAYOR. AND RIGHT NOW IT APPEARS TO BE A REALLY TIGHT RACE FOR THE BALTIMORE MAYORAL RACE BETWEEN INCUMBENT MAYOR BRANDON SCOTT AND FORMER MAYOR SHEILA DIXON. WE HAVE CREWS COVERING BOTH CAMPS, KHIREE IS WITH THE SHEILA DIXON CAMP IN REMINGTON AND TOMMIE. CLARKE IS WITH THE BRANDON SCOTT CAMP IN PORT COVINGTON. SO LET\u2019S GO OUT TO TOMMIE CLARKE RIGHT NOW. SO WHAT\u2019S IT LIKE WHERE YOU ARE? OH MY GOODNESS, ANDRE, YOU CAN FEEL THE ENERGY IN HERE. THE MUSIC IS PUMPING. DOZENS AND DOZENS OF FOLKS ARE IN THIS ROOM. THIS IS THE CAMP FOR MAYOR BRANDON SCOTT. YOU CAN SEE THE STAGE IS SET. WE\u2019RE JUST WAITING FOR HIM TO ARRIVE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? WE\u2019VE BEEN FOLLOWING HIS TRAIL ALL DAY TODAY. STARTING WITH THE VERY FIRST SPOT HE WENT TO ENGINE 56. THAT\u2019S WHERE HE VOTED WITH HIS FAMILY, INCLUDING BABY CHARM, SHOWING THEM HOW DEMOCRACY WORKS. AFTER THAT, HE WENT ACROSS THE CITY TODAY STUMPING FOR SUPPORT AND INCLUDING AT HAZELWOOD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. I CAUGHT UP WITH HIM THERE AND HAD A ONE ON ONE TIME WITH HIM. TALK ABOUT THIS CAMPAIGN. HE WAS SAYING HOW THROUGHOUT THE CITY HE HAS MADE SO MUCH CHANGE AND HE\u2019S STUMPING ON A COUPLE OF POINTS. HE\u2019S REALLY TALKING ABOUT THOSE REC CENTERS, HOW HE\u2019S BEEN GETTING THOSE OPEN. HE HAS FIVE MORE IN THE WORKS AND HIS OTHER MAIN POINT HE\u2019S BEEN REITERATING THROUGH THIS CAMPAIGN IS BRINGING THOSE HOMICIDE NUMBERS DOWN. BUT HE TELLS ME HE HAS A LOT MORE WORK TO DO. AND IN ORDER TO GET THAT DONE, HE WANTS TO SEE HIS REELECTION HAPPEN. BUT ONE PERSON IS STANDING IN THE WAY. THAT IS FORMER MAYOR SHEILA DIXON. OUR KAI REED IS COVERING HER CAMPAIGN AND KAI, HOW IS IT LOOKING OVER AT HER CAMP? OH, IT LOOKS LIKE YOU HAVE A PARTY GOING ON THERE, TOMMIE. AND WE HAVE A PRETTY BIG PARTY GOING ON HERE AS WELL. IT IS REALLY STARTING TO GET ENERGIZED HERE. THE LAST COUPLE OF MINUTES. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO FILE IN. WE HAVE NOT SEEN SHEILA DIXON YET THOUGH. THIS IS A HUMONGOUS SPACE. THIS IS ACTUALLY HER CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS. THERE ARE LIKE 5 OR 6 DIFFERENT ROOMS AND THEY ARE ALL FULL OF PEOPLE AND EVERYONE IS STARTING TO REALLY PLAY A PLAY. PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THESE NUMBERS. COME IN. SHEILA DIXON HAS SAID THIS HAS SAID, THIS IS IT. THIS IS HER THIRD AND FINAL ATTEMPT AT CITY HALL AFTER BEING FORCED OUT IN SCANDAL 14 YEARS AGO. THIS IS LOOKING LIKE A TIGHT RACE, AND IT\u2019S NOT SURPRISING. SHE HAS A VERY STRONG, LOYAL, COMMITTED BASE OF MOSTLY OLDER BLACK VOTERS. BUT SHE SAID THAT SHE KNEW SHE HAD TO REACH BEYOND HER BASE THIS TIME AROUND, AND SHE FEELS LIKE SHE\u2019S DONE THAT. SHE HAS TAPPED INTO VOTERS AS SHE SAYS SHE HAS NOT HAD SUPPORT FROM BEFORE NOW, SO SHE\u2019S FEELING VERY GOOD ABOUT THAT. AND SHE SAYS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THESE VOTERS THAT SHE\u2019S BEEN OUT CAMPAIGNING HAVE SAID TO HER IS THAT YOU KNOW, WE FEEL DISENFRANCHIZED WE FEEL UPSET, WE FEEL UNHEARD AND UNHAPPY ABOUT THIS CURRENT ADMINISTRATION. THIS IS WHAT SHE\u2019S SAYING NOW. SHE SAYS THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT THE QUALITY OF LIFE CRIMES. AND WE\u2019VE HEARD HER TALK ABOUT QUALITY OF LIFE CRIME SO MUCH THROUGHOUT THIS CAMPAIGN. SHE SAYS THAT SHE HAS THE LEADERSHIP. SHE HAS THE PAST EXPERIENCE TO GET THAT UNDER CONTROL. OF COURSE, MAYOR SCOTT SAYS THAT HE HAS GOTTEN CRIME UNDER CONTROL. SO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS? THIS IS THIS IS A TIGHT RACE HERE. SO WE\u2019RE JUST GOING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS. WE ARE EXPECTING HER HERE TONIGHT. WE DON\u2019T KNOW IF WE\u2019RE GOING TO GET THE FINAL NUMBERS TONIGHT. IF IT\u2019S GOING TO BE TOMORROW IF IT\u2019S GOING TO BE LATER THIS WEEK. BUT EITHER WAY, OUR NEXT SPEECH FROM SHEILA DIXON, SHE SAYS, IS EITHER GOING TO BE A VICTORY SPEECH OR IT\u2019S GOING TO BE A FAREWELL SPEECH. BUT REPORTING LIVE FROM NORTH BALTIMORE, DEB AND ANDRE, WE\u2019RE GOING TO SEND IT BACK TO YOU. KAI YOU ARE RIGHT ABOUT HOW CLOSE THIS RACE IS. WE\u2019RE GOING TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THE BALTIMORE CITY MAYOR\u2019S RACE RIGHT NOW, WITH 29% OF THE VOTES COUNTED RIGHT NOW, INCUMBENT MAYOR BRANDON SCOTT WITH 46% OF THE VOTE. FORMER MAYOR SHEILA DIXON WITH 44%, BOB WALLACE, BUSINESSMAN WITH 3% OF THE VOTE. RIGHT NOW. SO ONLY TWO PERCENTAGE POINTS SEPARATES THE TOP TWO CANDIDATES RIGHT NOW. WE\u2019LL HAVE MORE ON THAT IN JUST A BIT. BUT NOW LET\u2019S GO TO THE SECOND TOP JOB IN BALTIMORE CITY, THE COUNCIL PRESIDENT JOB. AND RIGHT NOW IT\u2019S NOT AS CLOSE HERE. ZEKE COHEN, CURRENT COUNCIL MEMBER WITH 49% OF THE VOTE. FORMER COUNCIL MEMBER SHANNON SNEED WITH 26%. AND THE INCUMBENT CITY COUNCIL PRESIDENT NICK MOSBY, WITH 25%. 28% OF THE VOTES BEING COUNTED RIGHT NOW. AND WE WANT TO CHECK IN NOW WITH 11 NEWS KHIREE STEWART. HE IS LIVE TONIGHT IN MOUNT VERNON WITH COHEN\u2019S CAMPAIGN. KHIREE. TELL US WHAT YOU\u2019RE SEEING THERE. HEY, SO LOTS OF EXCITEMENT HERE. FIRST OF ALL, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, YOU KNOW, WITH THE RESULTS COMING IN, WE\u2019RE ACTUALLY AT A RESTAURANT CALLED DARKER THAN BLUE GRILL HERE IN MOUNT VERNON. WE\u2019RE DOWN STAIRS BECAUSE AS YOU CAN SEE, RIGHT HERE BEHIND ME, HE HAS THIS PODIUM SET UP AND ALL THE SIGNS SET UP. HE IS EXPECTED TO SPEAK. I SAW HIM A LITTLE BIT EARLIER. HE\u2019S BEEN WALKING AROUND, YOU KNOW, SHAKING HANDS AND JUST TALKING TO PEOPLE. BUT HE IS AN ELITE RIGHT NOW. LIKE YOU SAID, YOU KNOW HE HAS MORE THAN 16,000 VOTES, CLOSE TO 50% OF THE VOTE. AND SNEED WITH JUST OVER 8000, AND MOSBY WITH JUST MORE THAN 8000 AS WELL. YOU KNOW, COHEN AND THE OTHER CANDIDATES REALLY HAD A BUSY DAY. I CAUGHT UP WITH TWO OF THEM. WE CAUGHT UP WITH ALL THREE, ACTUALLY, BUT THEY MADE STOPS AT DIFFERENT POLLING PLACES ALL AROUND THE CITY. THEY WERE OUT TALKING TO VOTERS AS WE ALL KNOW, COHEN HAS REPRESENTED THE CITY COUNCIL\u2019S FIRST DISTRICT FOR EIGHT YEARS. HE SAYS THAT PUBLIC SAFETY AND MENTAL HEALTH AND IMPROVING CITY SERVICES ARE SOME OF HIS TOP PRIORITIES, AND ALL OF THOSE ARE THINGS THAT HE PLANS TO FOCUS ON. IF HE WINS TONIGHT. SO AGAIN, THIS HOUSE IS PACKED RIGHT NOW. WE\u2019RE EXPECTING COHEN TO EVENTUALLY COME OUT AND GIVE A SPEECH HERE AT THE PODIUM RIGHT HERE BEHIND ME. THE NUMBERS ARE STILL TRICKLING IN. I\u2019VE BEEN WATCHING THEM. THEY\u2019VE LITERALLY BEEN CHANGING EVERY 2 TO 3 MINUTES. OF COURSE, WHEN THAT HAPPENS, AND AS SOON AS WE GET UPDATES, WE WILL BRING THAT TO YOU. REPORTING LIVE AT MOUNT VERNON, KHIREE STEWART, WBAL-TV 11 NEWS KHIREE STEWART, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 11 NEWS WILL HAVE ALL THE ELECTION RESULTS ON AIR AND ONLINE ALL NIGHT.

But she also said the federal government \"has never been better prepared\" to protect elections, thanks to lessons learned since Russia tried to influence voters in 2016.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThis year, \"Russia remains the most active foreign threat to our elections,\" Haines said. Using a \"vast multimedia influence apparatus\" encompassing state media, intelligence services and online trolls, Russia's goals \"include eroding trust in U.S. democratic institutions, exacerbating sociopolitical divisions in the United States, and degrading Western support to Ukraine.\"\n\nBut it's a crowded field, with China, Iran and other foreign actors also trying to sway American voters, Haines added.\n\nIn addition, she said the rise of new AI technologies that can create realistic \"deepfakes\" targeting candidates and of commercial firms through which foreign actors can launder their activities are enabling more sophisticated influence operations at larger scale that are harder to attribute.\n\nWednesday's hearing was the first in a series focused on the election, said committee chair Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., as lawmakers seek to avoid a repeat of 2016, when Russia's meddling caught lawmakers, officials and social media executives off-guard.\n\nSince then, \"the barriers to entry for foreign malign influence have unfortunately become incredibly small,\" Warner said. Foreign adversaries have more incentives to intervene in U.S. politics in an effort to shape their own national interests, he added, and at the same time, Americans' trust in institutions has eroded across the political spectrum.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSen. Marco Rubio of Florida, the committee's top Republican, questioned how those tasked with protecting the election would themselves be received in a climate of distrust. He raised the specter of a fake video targeting himself or another candidate in the days before November's election.\n\n\"Who is in charge of letting people know, this thing is fake, this thing is not real?\" he asked. \"And I ask myself, whoever is in charge of it, what are we doing to protect the credibility of the entity that is ... saying it, so that the other side does not come out and say, 'Our own government is interfering in the election'?\"\n\nHaines said in some cases it would make sense for her or other federal agencies to debunk false claims, while in others it may be better for state or local officials to speak out.",

        "text": "Biden's path to winning the Electoral College runs through the Midwest\nWith 174 days \u2014 fewer than six months \u2014 left until Election Day, we're now within the window where general-election polling has some predictive value \u2014 although it is still subject to plenty of change. And according to 538's newly released polling averages, former President Donald Trump narrowly leads President Joe Biden, 41.2 percent to 40.5 percent, in national polls (as of Wednesday at 1:30 p.m. Eastern).\n\nBut as any election analyst worth their salt will tell you, we elect the president via the Electoral College, not the popular vote. And in the last couple presidential elections, the Electoral College has benefited Republicans. In 2020, Biden won the national popular vote by 4.5 percentage points, but he won Wisconsin \u2014 the state that tipped him over the 270 electoral votes he needed to win \u2014 by only 0.6 points (representing a 3.9-point Electoral College bias toward Trump). And in 2016, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by 2.1 points, but she lost the tipping-point state, again Wisconsin, by 0.8 points \u2014 a 2.9-point Electoral College bias.\n\nBased on those numbers, you might assume that Trump's national polling lead means Biden is a significant underdog to win the Electoral College. But according to our state-level polling averages, that's not necessarily true. While he's trailing in the most competitive states, Biden remains within striking distance of Trump in states with just enough electoral votes to hand him the presidency.\n\nSeven states are generally considered to be competitive this fall, and when you look at our polling averages of each of them, six of them fall into two clean categories: Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, where Biden trails Trump by less than 2 points; and Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina, where Trump leads by a more comfortable 6- or 7-point margin. (Arizona, at Trump+3.5, is somewhere in the middle.)\n\nObviously, if those turn out to be the final margins in November, Trump would win every swing state and the presidency. But the numbers also point to a narrow but feasible path for Biden to win. If he carries Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, plus every other state and district* that he won by at least 6 points in 2020, he would finish with exactly 270 electoral votes:**\n\nThat's well within the realm of possibility. To reach that threshold, Biden would just need to gain 2 points in our polling averages of those three states between now and November, which is not a very big lift. Plus, it's within the margin of reasonable polling error; even polls on the eve of the election have an average error of 4 points in presidential elections. Ultimately, state-level polls 174 days before the election have historically missed the final vote margin by about 8 points. So while Trump leads the presidential race right now, that lead is not safe.\n\nAfter so much was made in 2016 and 2020 about Democrats' eroding support in the Midwest and their emergence in the Sun Belt, it's interesting that the polls so clearly indicate that Biden's best path to victory runs through the old \"blue wall\" states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. But it probably shouldn't be too surprising. States don't march consistently and inevitably in one direction over time; historically, they're just as likely to revert to the mean. And Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have much more of a history of voting Democratic than Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina do. (Nevada is the exception here \u2014 it has voted Democratic in every presidential election since 2008.)\n\nBiden's weakness in the Sun Belt also isn't too surprising given his widely publicized struggles with voters of color; the Sun Belt states are much more racially diverse than the three northern states where Biden is still competitive.\n\nAt the same time, Democrats should face no illusions about the task ahead of them. Winning Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin will require Biden to proactively improve in the polls (or hope that they are wrong \u2014 and generally you don't want to leave your campaign up to fate!), something he has struggled to do so far this year. This path also leaves the campaign no margin for error: If Biden loses just one of those three states, he'd need to carry one or more of the more challenging Sun Belt states to make up for it.\n\nAnd there's one further wrinkle: Getting to 270 electoral votes via Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin would also require Biden to win the electoral vote from Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District, which Biden won by only 6 points in 2020, according to Daily Kos Elections. Polls of Nebraska's 2nd District are scarce, but the one we do have suggests that Trump is leading there right now.\n\nAnd if Trump wins Nebraska's 2nd while Biden wins Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, the Electoral College would be tied 269-269. Under the Constitution, that would throw the election to the House of Representatives, where each state's delegation (not each representative) would get one vote, with 26 out of 50 votes needed to elect the president. Trump would very likely win under such a scenario because Republicans will probably control a majority of congressional delegations after the election, even if they don't have an overall House majority.\n\nThe House hasn't needed to step in to decide the presidential election since 1824, but the way the electoral map is shaping up, there is a nonzero chance it could happen this year.\n\nFootnotes\n\n*Maine and Nebraska split their electoral votes by congressional district \u2014 which, as I'll get to, could prove important this year.\n\n**That means Pennsylvania, where Trump leads the polls by an average of 1.7 points, is \u2014 for now \u2014 positioned as the tipping-point state in the election. With Trump currently leading in national polls by a similar 1.0-point margin, that means polls suggest that the pro-Republican bias in the Electoral College has shrunk significantly from 2016 and 2020. (Of course, this could change.)",

        "text": "The Choice: Meacham and Geer on 2024\nThe Choice, produced by the Dialogue Vanderbilt, is a four-part podcast focused on the key moments and ramifications of the 2024 presidential election between former president Donald J. Trump and current President Joseph R. Biden. Vanderbilt\u2019s Jon Meacham and John Geer will blend history and political science to offer insights and context about this rematch of the 2020 presidential contest. One objective is to offer an evidence-based assessment of the election that rises above the typical kind of comments offered by the overly ideological news media. The second, and related, objective is to show how this electoral battle fits into the long arc of American history.\n\nThe series will premiere at the end of August. There will be editions in September and October, then a concluding session that assesses the results and implications of the 2024 rematch. Each conversation will last about 45 minutes.\n\nHistory has shown us that this country is often closely divided, and 2024 promises to be hotly contested. \u201cSmall d\u201d democracy is not for the faint of heart, and 2024 may be a true test of that claim.\n\nJon Meacham, co-chair of the Vanderbilt Project on Unity and American Democracy, Distinguished Visiting Professor of Political Science and Carolyn T. and Robert M. Rogers Chair in American Presidency, is a renowned presidential historian, contributing writer to The New York Times Book Review, contributing editor at TIME and a Pulitzer Prize-winning author.\n\nJohn Geer, a professor of political science who also holds a Gertrude Conway Vanderbilt Chair, leads the Vanderbilt Project on Unity and American Democracy and serves as a senior advisor to Chancellor Daniel Diermeier on critical strategic initiatives promoting democracy and open dialogue.\n\nGeer and Meacham will co-teach an Elections 2024 course this fall with professors Nicole Hemmer and Josh Clinton. This class appears poised to be the largest in-person class in the history of the university, with likely nearly 1,000 students enrolled. That level of interest underscores in a different way the importance of this upcoming battle for the White House.",

Some aspects \u2013 including the lack of a studio audience \u2013 will be a departure from previous debates.\n\nCNN has set several parameters for candidates to qualify for the debate, which will be hosted by Jake Tapper and Dana Bash.\n\nAll participating debaters must meet the requirements outlined in Article II, Section 1 of the US Constitution to serve as president. Both Biden and Trump meet those requirements, as do Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Cornel West and Jill Stein, who are running on non-major-party tickets.\n\nParticipants must file a formal statement of candidacy to the Federal Election Commission. All five have done so.\n\nCandidates must also appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to reach the 270 electoral vote threshold to win the presidency and receive at least 15% in four separate national polls of registered or likely voters that meet CNN\u2019s standards for reporting. Polls that meet those standards are those sponsored by CNN, ABC News, CBS News, Fox News, Marquette University Law School, Monmouth University, NBC News, The New York Times/Siena College, NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist College, Quinnipiac University, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post.\n\nBiden and Trump will meet those requirements, but they make the others less likely to be able to participate - though, in Kennedy\u2019s case, it\u2019s not an impossibility.\n\nKennedy is on the ballot in only five states, though the campaign says it has gathered enough signatures to make it on the ballots of several more. West\u2019s campaign says he has secured ballot access for six states.\n\nKennedy has been averaging about 13% in recent national polling. West and Stein have been averaging at about 3%.\n\nDebaters must also agree to accept the rules and format of the debate. Trump and Biden have agreed to do so.\n\nBoth Trump and Biden have also agreed to participate in another debate hosted by ABC on September 10.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.",

        "text": "US November election results could decelerate energy transition, with $1 trillion in energy investment on the line\nThe Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) of 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 catapulted the US to global leadership in decarbonisation. But a victory for former President Donald Trump in the November 2024 election, combined with long-standing issues around the US relationship with China and US government deficits, could significantly alter the path of US energy policy and usher in a delayed transition scenario, according to a new Horizons report from Wood Mackenzie.\n\nWhile investments for technologies that support the energy transition and low carbon technology may decelerate, the opposite effect might take place for fossil fuels, which could see expanded investment and push out peak fossil fuel demand, according to the report, \u201cHitting the brakes: how the energy transition could decelerate in the US.\"\n\n\u201cThis election cycle will really influence the pace of energy investment, both in the next five years and through 2050. Investments in low carbon supply need to be made in the near term to realize longer-dated decarbonization targets. US carbon emissions could grow, putting net zero out of reach in our delayed transition scenario,\u201d according to David Brown, director of Wood Mackenzie\u2019s Energy Transition Research.\n\n\u201cIt is not likely that the IRA will be fully repealed,\u201d said Brown. \u201cHowever, a second Trump presidency would likely issue executive orders that would abandon the 2035 net zero target for the power sector, establish softer emissions goals from the EPA, and issue tax credit regulations that could favour blue hydrogen.\u201d\n\nBrown added that the fiscal environment may prove challenging as well, as US government spending could be limited to address the country\u2019s debt burden \u2013 the US Congressional Budget Office expects the US debt-to-GDP ratio to reach 109% by 2030 and hit 155% by 2050.\n\nWood Mackenzie\u2019s base case projects about US$7.7 trillion in investment for the US energy sector over 2023-50. However, in the delayed transition scenario in the US, less policy support for things such as low-carbon energy and infrastructure improvements decreases investment for the US energy sector by US$ 1 trillion compared to the base case.\n\nUS capital investment in the energy sector, cumulative, 2023-2050, in US$ trillion\n\nSource: Wood Mackenzie. Total capital investment for the US includes upstream oil and gas, power generation, power grid and EV infrastructure, hydrogen and CCUS. US$11.8 trillion dollars in capital investment in US energy is required on a cumulative basis from 2023-2050 to reach our net zero scenario. Investment is 55% lower in our delayed transition scenario.\n\nAccording to the report, where policy support for low-carbon energy is cut back, CCUS and low-carbon hydrogen would face a slower investment pathway. Total US natural gas demand would rise to be 6 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) higher than our base case by 2030, a jump of 6%.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that peak fossil fuel demand does occur \u2013 it is just around 10 years later than the 2030 prediction in our base case. With a peak still on the horizon, companies will need to continue diversifying into low carbon technologies to build a business model that is resilient through the energy transition. Each sector, from transport to power and emerging technologies, will be affected by a nuanced set of drivers.\u201d\n\nUS net energy-related CO 2 emissions by outlook, in billions of tonnes\n\nSector impacts:\n\nEV sales stumble: A look at new car sales in the US so far in 2024 offers clear indications that a slower energy transition is plausible. While sales of hybrids have leapt 57%, EV sales have undershot expectations, growing by only 19%. Weakening federal greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and fuel economy regulations continue this trend, and the total stock of EVs by 2050 would be 50% lower than in Wood Mackenzie\u2019s base case.\n\nA look at new car sales in the US so far in 2024 offers clear indications that a slower energy transition is plausible.

Zero carbon power supply faces strong headwinds: With less financial support from the Department of Energy Loan Program Office, fewer grid improvements, and continued trade tension with China, the delayed transition scenario for the US projects that wind and solar and energy storage capacity would be about 500 gigawatts (GW) by 2050, 25% lower than the base case.\n\nWith less financial support from the Department of Energy Loan Program Office, fewer grid improvements, and continued trade tension with China, the delayed transition scenario for the US projects that wind and solar and energy storage capacity would be about 500 gigawatts (GW) by 2050, 25% lower than the base case. Coal would remain in the mix for longer . In the delayed energy transition scenario, the pace of electrification would ease in the near term. However, industrial, residential, electrolytic hydrogen and EV usage would still combine to increase power demand by 2.0 petawatt-hours (PWh), a 45% jump from 2030 to 2050. With less policy support for renewables and continued load growth, there would be no way out of using coal. As a result, by 2040, coal generation capacity would be four times higher than the base case, with 104 GW on the system.\n\n.

As a result, by 2040, coal generation capacity would be four times higher than the base case, with 104 GW on the system. Low-carbon hydrogen could falter. The lack of federal demand-side targets, reductions in federal funding and cost inflation would challenge the investment case for low-carbon hydrogen. Eligibility for tax credits under the IRA could be adjusted to tilt incentives towards blue hydrogen. Near-term growth shifts to export markets in Europe and Asia; Wood Mackenzie\u2019s delayed transition scenario would still foresee a two million tonne export market emerging by 2050.\n\nStates would be the future\n\nA look at state-level policies shows that momentum for low-carbon investment can be independent of federal policy. Since 2020, California\u2019s utility-scale battery capacity has expanded eight-fold to 8.4 GW. By the end of the year, Wood Mackenzie expects battery capacity to reach 11.7 GW.\n\nState-level renewable portfolio standards and voluntary renewable energy targets supported wind and solar capacity expansions of over 13% a year on average between 2016 and 2020, during the last Trump administration. California\u2019s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) will help underpin investments in low-carbon hydrogen, direct air capture (DAC) and bioenergy across the country.\n\n\u201cA slower transition scenario for emerging technologies does not mean the story is over,\u201d said Brown. \u201cThe emerging technology sector in the US will need to reassess costs, project sizes, and subsidy reliance. This should be approached through a position of confidence. The US has a track record of innovation \u2013 the US went from a net LNG importer to the world\u2019s largest LNG exporter over the last decade.\u201d",

You can read the previous edition here. Sign up for free here to get it on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Email us at electioncountdown@ft.com\n\nGood morning and happy Thursday! Today we\u2019re chatting about:\n\nThe tariff race is on\n\nRay Dalio\u2019s election warning\n\nThe latest inflation data\n\nThe 2024 election battle has a new front: tariffs.\n\nJoe Biden and Donald Trump are racing to prove who is tougher on US trade with China, and thus who is the fiercer defender of working class jobs.\n\nAs the president announced on Tuesday that he would slap new tariffs on $18bn worth of Chinese goods, he was probably hoping that voters in the Rust Belt swing states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin were paying close attention [free to read]. Trade matters a lot to blue-collar workers in these states, and this is a demographic bloc that both presidential contenders are vying to win over.\n\n\u201cMy predecessor promised to increase American exports and boost manufacturing. But he didn\u2019t [do] either. He failed,\u201d Biden said. The Biden administration said the new tariffs would protect large manufacturing investments from Chinese competition.\n\nFor his part, Trump has said he\u2019ll hit all Chinese goods with tariffs of at least 60 per cent should he make it back into the Oval Office.\n\nIn case you need a refresher, Trump launched a trade war against Beijing the year after he took office, targeting $300bn in Chinese goods. Biden has kept those in place and is now setting his sights on more strategic industries \u2014 such as clean energy, semiconductors and metals \u2014 with his levies, even though he was critical of his predecessor\u2019s trade war. He once said they were in effect a penalty on US consumers.\n\nBut tensions with Beijing flared during Biden\u2019s tenure, so he ultimately embraced Trump\u2019s protectionist approach. And there is, of course, the matter of re-election.\n\nBiden has made the industrialisation of the US economy a cornerstone of his presidency, and he needs to make sure that union workers in former industrial powerhouses are behind him. He\u2019s betting the tariffs will help build out a domestic supply chain in areas like clean tech and electric vehicle making, and bring the US industrial base to life while shielding it from cheap Chinese imports.\n\nCampaign clips: the latest election headlines\n\nCNN said it would host the primetime debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump in its Atlanta studios \u00a9 AP\n\nBiden has asserted executive privilege over the recording of his interview with the special counsel investigating his handling of classified documents, blocking the audio from House Republicans. (WSJ)\n\nBiden and Trump are set to debate on June 27 on CNN, marking a break from the traditional calendar. They\u2019ll also be without the customary live audience.\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act, has created a $47bn market to spur the US energy transition while letting corporations lower their tax bills; American football star Travis Kelce is among those joining in [free to read].\n\nPolling shows Biden has particularly weak support in Nevada, where his messages are not resonating with Latino voters. (NYT)\n\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson and other Republican allies showed up to court to support Trump at his \u201chush money\u201d trial in New York.\n\nBehind the scenes\n\nRay Dalio, the billionaire founder of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, thinks this is the most important US presidential election in his lifetime.\n\nHe told the FT\u2019s Kate Duguid that it could exacerbate political polarisation to the point of bringing on a type of \u201ccivil war\u201d \u2014 not necessarily an armed conflict, but one in which \u201cpeople move to different states that are more aligned with what they want and they don\u2019t follow the decisions of federal authorities of the opposite political persuasion.\u201d\n\nThe finance giant said the election would test the health of US democracy. Though Dalio declined to back a candidate, this is how he\u2019s thinking about the options:\n\nTrump will follow more rightist, nationalistic, isolationist, protectionist, non-regulatory policies \u2014 and more aggressive policies to fight enemies internally and externally, including political enemies. Biden, and even more so the Democratic Party without Biden, will be more the opposite, though they too will play political hardball.\n\nHe did, however, reveal that he recently attended a Taylor Swift concert. \u201cShe brought people of all sorts \u2014 and many nationalities \u2014 together,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cI say this partly as a joke, but if she ran for president and would listen to great advisers, I\u2019d consider supporting her.\u201d\n\nDatapoint\n\nMuch to the delight of the Biden administration, data released yesterday showed that headline inflation ticked down in April.\n\nThe consumer price index showed that inflation fell to 3.4 per cent last month from 3.5 per cent in March. It was the first time this year that CPI did not come in higher than expected.\n\nAfter the CPI reading, traders increased their bets that the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this year. A cut before the election could be good for Biden, whose re-election bid has been dogged by persistently high inflation.\n\nThe monthly FT-Michigan Ross poll has shown voters\u2019 continued frustration with inflation this year. Eighty per cent of voters polled this month said high prices were one of their biggest financial challenges.\n\nBut the latest reading is still unlikely to completely assuage voters\u2019 concerns.\n\n\n\nWednesday\u2019s \u201cinflation number will be seen by some as progress and by others as a sign that inflation is still a problem. It probably is not good enough news for the Biden campaign but it could have been a lot worse,\u201d said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business.\n\nViewpoints\n\nThe Democratic and Republican parties are in a race to see who can deglobalise fastest, writes Edward Luce.\n\nBiden\u2019s China tariffs are more bark than bite, Amanda Chu says in today\u2019s Energy Source newsletter [available for Premium subscribers].\n\nThe 2024 presidential race is officially a climate election now, declared Bill McKibben. (The New Yorker)\n\nTej Parikh has a critical question: \u201cWhat even is inflation?\u201d he asks in Alphaville. He goes on to explain the difference between CPI and personal consumption expenditures, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation metric.\n\nHave your say Joe Biden vs Donald Trump: tell us how the 2024 US election will affect you",

        "text": "New Polling on Child Care and the 2024 Election\nA new poll conducted on behalf of First Five Years Fund by the bipartisan research team of New Bridge Strategies (R) and Hart Research (D) found that, in this election year, voters by overwhelming margins want candidates to have a plan to address child care challenges in the United States.\n\nThe poll, which surveyed registered voters nationwide and registered voters in battleground Senate states (Arizona, Maryland, Montana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Nevada), also found voters make a strong connection between expanding access to quality child care and a strong economy. And across all demographics, voters expressed strong support for solutions including increasing funding going to states to expand child care options and modernizing the tax system to support child care and early learning. Below are key findings, a one pager, and a deck from the pollsters.\n\n\u201cThis poll clearly demonstrates that not only do voters want Congress to do more to address child care challenges today; they also want future lawmakers to have a plan for addressing child care challenges tomorrow.\n\nVoters understand the strain that finding and affording care has on families. They also understand the direct connection child care challenges has on the economy and the benefit that quality care has on our little ones. Now the message to candidates is unequivocal \u2013 let\u2019s move beyond defining the problem and get to work enacting tangible, common-sense policies.\n\nActions like improving child care tax credits and increasing federal child care funding for states are incredibly popular. Current lawmakers and candidates on the campaign trail have the opportunity now to leverage this clear bipartisan support to bring much-needed assistance to working families with young children.\u201c\n\n\u2013 Sarah Rittling, First Five Years Fund Executive Director\n\nVOTERS WANT CANDIDATES TO HAVE A PLAN\n\nIn this election year, an overwhelming majority of voters (89%) want candidates to have a plan or policies ready to help working parents afford high-quality child care. This cuts across party lines, with 80% of Republicans, 88% of Independents, and 99% of Democrats.\n\n2024 LOOK: 82% of Trump voters and 96% of Biden voters want candidates to have a plan or policies ready to help working parents afford high-quality child care.\n\nVOTERS SAY CHILD CARE IS ESSENTIAL/VERY IMPORTANT TO THE ECONOMY\n\nVoters make a strong connection between child care and a strong economy, with 68% of all voters saying access to high-quality, affordable child care is \u201cessential/very important\u201d to strengthening the economy. This includes 53% of Republicans, 64% of Independents, and 84% of Democrats.\n\nAND THEY\u2019RE THINKING ABOUT THIS GOING INTO THE 2024 ELECTIONS\n\nVoters are more likely to support candidates who support child care solutions. A strong majority of both national and swing state voters say they\u2019d be more likely to vote for a candidate who supports increased federal funding to the states (also known as the Child Care Development Block Grant, or CCDBG) to expand child care. This includes:\n\n85% of all voters, including 73% of Trump voters and 95% of Biden voters.\n\nAnd over four-fifths of voters (85%) in states that will be critical to the makeup of the United States Senate \u2013 Arizona, Maryland, Montana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Nevada.\n\nVOTERS WANT CHILD CARE SOLUTIONS\n\nVoters overwhelmingly support policies that help working families with young children access child care. This includes strong support for increased federal funding provided to states to expand their existing child care programs as well as expanding federal tax benefits to both families and employers.\n\nExpanding Existing Child Care Programs Like Child Care Development Block Grant (CCDBG): An overwhelming majority of voters (85%) support increasing federal funding to the states which allows them to expand their child care programs (known as CCDBG). This includes 74% of Republicans, 86% of Independents, and 96% of Democrats.\n\nIncreasing the Federal Child Care Tax Credit (Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit, or CDCTC): A large majority of voters (76%) support increasing the federal child care tax credit (CDCTC), the only existing tax credit specifically designed to help ease the burden of child care costs for working families. This includes 62% of Republicans, 74% of Independents, and 92% of Democrats.\n\nCONCERNS OVER CHILD CARE REMAIN HIGH POST PANDEMIC\n\nContrary to the narrative that child care concerns and struggles peaked during the pandemic, voters remain as concerned about child care today as they were at the height of the pandemic.",

        "text": "Who benefits from US tariffs on Chinese imports? Experts weigh in\nWhile the tariffs are expected to have a negligible impact on the US economy, they are expected to boost President Biden.\n\nThe trade war between the United States and China continued this week with its latest salvo \u2013 a move that comes amid a heated race for the White House.\n\nOn Tuesday, US President Joe Biden announced tariff hikes on imports of various Chinese goods, worth $18bn.\n\nLithium-ion batteries make up $13bn of the total imports, while certain steel and aluminium products, as well as items like medical gloves and syringes, accounted for the remaining $5bn.\n\nExperts say tariffs on these products will likely have limited effects on consumer goods prices and economic growth. The greater gain, they say, may lie at the ballot box, as Biden jockeys for a second term in the White House.\n\n\u201cThese tariffs are very much on the margins, and the impacts on the economy will be a rounding error,\u201d Bernard Yaros, lead US economist at Oxford Economics, told Al Jazeera.\n\nWhile the tariffs do not change much for the US economy, it is still \u201cgood politics to do this\u201d, especially during an election year, Yaros added.\n\nProjecting strength\n\nThe US is set to hold a presidential vote in November, and Biden is expected to face his predecessor, former Republican President Donald Trump, in a tightly fought race.\n\nTrump has long sought to project a tough-man image, particularly in foreign policy and the economy, while framing his Democratic rival as \u201cweak\u201d. Biden, however, has sought to deflect that criticism by imposing policies that, in some cases, build on Trump\u2019s.\n\nA January paper (PDF) from the National Bureau of Economic Research suggests that tariffs can pay political dividends, even if they do not translate into \u201csubstantial job gains\u201d.\n\nThe paper looked at the period from 2018 to 2019, when Trump slapped stiff tariffs on China and other countries, targeting products like aluminium, washing machines and solar panels.\n\nIt found that residents in US regions that were more exposed to import tariffs became less likely to identify as Democrats and more likely to vote Republican.\n\nThe report concluded that voters \u201cresponded favourably\u201d to the tariffs \u201cdespite their economic cost\u201d, which came in the form of retaliatory tariffs from China.\n\n\u201cTariffs are good politics, even though the economics don\u2019t work,\u201d Yaros said.\n\nAppealing to the Rust Belt\n\nBiden and Trump are in a neck-and-neck race, with some polls showing the Republican candidate edging out the incumbent in key swing states.\n\nA poll this week from the New York Times, Siena College and the Philadelphia Inquirer, for instance, found that Trump had an advantage in pivotal states like Arizona, Nevada and Georgia.\n\nBiden appeared in one of those states, Pennsylvania, last month to announce his intention to triple tariffs on Chinese steel. Pennsylvania is part of the Rust Belt, a region historically known for manufacturing, and the state itself is famed for steel production.\n\nBrad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said Biden has also sought to protect other US industries, like its burgeoning electric vehicle (EV) sector.\n\nHis new trade rules will ensure that the US cannot directly import EVs made in China, Setser explained.\n\nHe added that China has built a competitive EV industry on the back of deep government subsidies and could flood the global and US markets with cheap cars if it was not for such measures.\n\n\u201cChina, with its significant auto needs, provided a lot of subsidies to its EV industry that has led to this strength,\u201d said Setser.\n\n\u201cIt needs to recognise that the US and Europe will use some of these techniques [of subsidies and tariffs] to build their own industries. It\u2019s unrealistic for China to object to other countries doing the same thing.\u201d\n\nProtecting the American auto industry will also help Biden in the polls. The sector is historically centred in Michigan, another key battleground state where Biden has recently faced backlash.\n\nMichigan is the birthplace of the \u201cuncommitted\u201d movement, which encouraged Democrats to withhold their votes from Biden during the primaries and cast ballots for the \u201cuncommitted\u201d option instead.\n\nThe protest was seen as a part of a broader, largely progressive backlash to Biden\u2019s unwavering support for Israel\u2019s war in Gaza.\n\nLooking ahead to November\n\nHowever, the experts who spoke to Al Jazeera questioned whether Biden\u2019s newly announced tariffs would move the needle at election time.\n\nThe US imported $427bn in goods from China in 2023, but it only exported $148bn to the country in return, according to the US Census Bureau.\n\nThat trade gap has persisted for decades and become an ever more sensitive subject in Washington, particularly as China competes with the US to be the world\u2019s largest economy.\n\nWhile the trans-Pacific trade has benefitted both countries \u2013 providing cheap goods to American consumers and a large market to Chinese manufacturers \u2013 it remains a contentious issue, especially at election time, because of a history of US manufacturing jobs moving overseas.\n\nUS politicians have also raised concerns over privacy, as Chinese technology enters the North American market.\n\nAlthough China has promised retaliation for the latest round of tariffs, experts say it will likely be symbolic as the US tariffs themselves are very targeted.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t assume the retaliation will be anything disruptive,\u201d said Yaros. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to up the ante. That\u2019s not been their MO [modus operandi] in the past when the US has imposed tariffs.\u201d",

        "text": "Republican Missouri attorney general candidates proclaim 2020 election was stolen \u2022 Missouri Independent\nThe two Republican candidates running for Missouri attorney general agreed this week that the 2020 presidential election was stolen, parroting claims spread by Donald Trump and his allies that have been widely debunked.\n\nAppearing at a candidate forum in Springfield on Tuesday, Attorney General Andrew Bailey and former federal prosecutor Will Scharf laid out their reasoning for why they believe Trump\u2019s defeat in 2020 was illegitimate.\n\nBailey said the presidential election was \u201cabsolutely stolen.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe left stole that election by changing the rules of the game at the 11th hour,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to try to steal this one by silencing our voices on big tech social media platforms, by stifling us in the mainstream media and by packing the polling places with criminal illegal aliens that shouldn\u2019t be here in the first place.\u201d\n\nScharf agreed, saying \u201cit was stolen. It was rigged. Call it whatever you will.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the 2020 election, out of 159 million ballots cast, over 100 (million) were early or absentee,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely unprecedented in American history. Many of those ballots were cast totally extra legally, whether it was a lack of signature verification, whether it was the late submission in Pennsylvania, you can go on and on and on.\u201d\n\nNeed to get in touch? Have a news tip? CONTACT US\n\nDemocrat Elad Gross, who also participated in the forum, answered the question of whether the 2020 election was stolen with one word.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said.\n\nNumerous independent studies and government reviews of the 2020 election found no evidence of widespread voter fraud. The former president\u2019s allegations of voting fraud were debunked by his former attorney general, William Barr, dismissed by a litany of judges and refuted by state election officials. Studies have also concluded that there is little evidence that mail-in ballots help one party over another.\n\nA six-month review of ballots in the largest county in Arizona commissioned by Republican state legislators found that President Joe Biden not only won the state but should have been awarded 306 more votes.\n\nNevada\u2019s Republican secretary of state reviewed tens of thousands of allegations of voter fraud identified by the state Republican Party, determining that the majority were baseless or inaccurately interpreted.\n\nA review of the 2020 election ordered by the Republican leader of the Wisconsin legislature found \u201cabsolutely no evidence of election fraud.\u201d That confirmed an earlier finding by a nonpartisan audit.\n\nA committee led by Republican state lawmakers in Michigan concluded after a months-long investigation that there was no widespread or systematic fraud in the state in 2020.\n\nAnd in Georgia, the Republican governor and secretary of state recertified Biden\u2019s win after conducting three statewide counts. Trump allies who made claims of election fraud in the state have recanted, and one \u2014 former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani \u2014 lost a defamation lawsuit over the allegations filed by former Georgia election workers.\n\nDespite all this, surveys have found that two-thirds of Republican voters continue to believe that the 2020 election was stolen and that Biden was not lawfully elected.\n\nOther issues\n\nThe Springfield forum is the first event where all three major candidates in the Missouri attorney general race appeared together.\n\nBailey is a first-time candidate appointed to the job by Gov. Mike Parson in 2022, after his predecessor won a seat in the U.S. Senate. He\u2019s an Army veteran and former assistant prosecuting attorney in Warren County and assistant attorney general who was Parson\u2019s top attorney when he won the appointment.\n\nScharf is also a first-time candidate who entered politics in 2015 when he worked as policy director for Catherine Hanaway\u2019s bid campaign for governor. After she lost in the primary, he took a similar job with Eric Greitens and joined the administration when Greitens became governor. He left state government after Greitens resigned in disgrace, eventually becoming an assistant U.S. attorney in St. Louis prosecuting violent crimes.\n\nGross is a former assistant attorney general who runs his own law firm in St. Louis with a major focus on Missouri\u2019s Sunshine Law. In 2021, he won a unanimous ruling from the Missouri Supreme Court that public agencies could not charge for time attorneys spend reviewing public records that are requested under the Sunshine Law. He ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for attorney general in 2020.\n\nEach candidate answered questions on a wide variety of topics, including transgender rights, affirmative action and the role of the attorney general\u2019s office.\n\nBailey painted himself as a \u201cconservative warrior\u201d who would fight against the \u201cwoke left.\u201d He repeatedly mentioned his roots in Missouri as his motivation for seeking public office.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Christian. I\u2019m a father. I\u2019m a veteran. Those three things\u2026 guide everything that I do in a leadership role in the State of Missouri.\u201d\n\nScharf hammered what he believes to be a \u201cculture of corruption\u201d in Jefferson City that needs to be rooted out and held accountable. He also highlighted his work as an attorney for Trump in various legal cases, including the former president\u2019s federal election interference case.\n\n\u201cCurrently I have one client. His name is Donald J. Trump,\u201d Scharf said. \u201cI\u2019ve fought for him in courtrooms across America, all the way to the United States Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nGross said he\u2019s running to ensure \u201cwe can have a Missouri that serves all of us once again.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we start to leave some of us behind, we\u2019re leaving all of us behind,\u201d he said. \u201cWe owe it to the people of Missouri to bring good, strong, thoughtful leadership back to Jefferson City.\u201d\n\nOne point of agreement for three candidates was that unregulated slot machines offering cash prizes to players that proliferate in Missouri are illegal, though they appear to differ on who should enforce that.\n\nMissouri has legal, regulated gambling in the form of a state lottery, 13 casinos, charity bingo and raffles. The unregulated, or \u201cgray market\u201d machines, are considered legal by their backers because they reveal the outcome of the next wager on request or mimic a raffle.\n\nBailey, who has accepted campaign contributions from the companies that operate the devices, said the entire situation is \u201ca failure of the status quo in Jefferson City.\u201d He said local prosecutors could take up those cases when they are referred to them by police.\n\n\u201cAs police investigate those criminal offenses and refer them, you prosecute the criminals,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cThe police sees the evidence and you destroy pursuant to a court order. Prosecute crimes and enforce the rule of law.\u201d\n\nScharf dismissed any argument that the machines could be considered legal and vowed to prosecute cases himself if elected.\n\n\u201cThey are blatantly illegal. I\u2019ve read Missouri law,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re illegal. They shouldn\u2019t be there and yet they\u2019re in almost every gas station you\u2019ll go into. They\u2019re all over the place.\u201d\n\nGross said the machines are illegal and \u201cwe should get rid of them.\u201d And after that, he said changes to state law should be enacted to \u201cmake sure that companies that are running these illegal operations are not then trying to buy those offices that have enforcement authority.\u201d",

        "text": "WATCH: Statue of Rev. Billy Graham unveiled at U.S. Capitol\nA statue of the late Rev. Billy Graham was unveiled inside the U.S. Capitol in a ceremony on Thursday.\n\nWatch in the player above.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, other congressional members and the family of the Charlotte-born evangelist attended the unveiling of the 7-foot (2.1-meter) tall bronze statue in the National Statuary Hall.\n\nThe North Carolina General Assembly approved legislation in 2015 asking a congressional committee to eventually approve a likeness of Graham for display in the hall. Rules say a person\u2019s statue can only be installed posthumously. Graham, who lived most of his adult life in Montreat, died in 2018 at age 99.\n\nEach state gets two statues. The Graham statue will replace one of early 20th-century Gov. Charles Aycock, who, while known as an education advocate, has fallen from favor because of his ties to the white supremacy movement at the time.\n\nThe Graham sculpture, created by Charlotte-based artist Chas Fagan, depicts Graham gesturing toward an open Bible in his hand, the association said. The statue was bronzed in Seagrove. The base, created from Rowan County granite, is inscribed with two Bible verses that highlight Graham\u2019s evangelistic ministry.\n\nThe other North Carolina statue commissioned for the National Statuary Hall is a likeness of Civil War-era Gov. Zebulon Vance, who was also a Confederate military officer and U.S. senator.\n\nGraham was the most widely heard Christian evangelist in history, preaching in person to more than 210 million people worldwide.",

        "text": "New, Younger Latino Voters are Driving Shifts in Latino Voter Sentiment\n1 out of 5 Hispanic voters will be voting in their first presidential election in November\n\nWASHINGTON, DC\u2014 As a part of its Latino Vote Initiative, UnidosUS today hosted the second installment of the Latino Vote Briefing Series with a deep dive on Latino candidate and party support.\n\nFor a detailed memo on Latino candidate and party support, see here .\n\n. For a slide presentation of our findings, see here .\n\n. For a video recording of our virtual briefing, see here.\n\nGiven their decisive electoral influence, there has been considerable chatter about an observed \u201cshift\u201d in the sentiments of Latino voters, first noted in the 2020 election, through the 2022 election, and after, in some national polling regarding the upcoming 2024 election. Drawing from historical party support patterns, election data and our own public opinion research, UnidosUS and BSP explored the breadth and depth of this potential shift, its correlates and whether such a shift could represent a \u201crealignment\u201d of Latino voters.\n\nOne thing remains constant: given the Latino community\u2019s youth, every election cycle will see a significant number of new Hispanic voters. In 2024, it is anticipated that 17.5 million Latinos will cast a ballot, and 1 in 5 of them will be doing so for the first time in a presidential election. A full 38% of this electorate will be new since the Trump/Clinton match up of 2016. Newer voters are 14% less likely to identify as Democrats (45%) than more established voters (59%). Importantly, they are also five points less likely to identify as Republicans (18%) than more established voters (23%). Independence is the big winner, with 36% of voters in newer cohorts identifying as independent or non-partisan, compared with just 18% of established voters.\n\nClarissa Mart\u00ednez De Castro, Vice President, UnidosUS Latino Vote Initiative said \u201cAmong the most recent Latino registrants, nearly half (44.6%) are undecided, while just above one-fourth each prefer Trump or Biden. Based on these data, if we observe a significant shift on election day, new voters are the most potent source. Latino voters have often been taken for granted, and that has been reflected in the levels of outreach and investment they receive. These findings put an even greater exclamation point on the need for candidates and parties to engage these voters early and meaningfully if they want to win over their support.\u201d\n\nGary Segura, Ph.D., President and co-founder of BSP Research said, \u201cWhile we can see the drift, it is less clear whether it is episodic or long term. And to date, claims of widespread partisan switching have gone largely unexamined. Our results appear to identify newer younger voters as the group among whom sentiments appear to be shifting.\u201d\n\nKey Discoveries:\n\nThere is a significant difference between long-term registrants and voters new since 2016.\n\nThey are less Democratic than more established voters and less supportive of the president.\n\nHowever, they remain largely suspicious of the GOP.\n\nMost of these new voters are young voters:\n\nTheir issue agenda does not vary appreciably from that of more established voters except on the importance of health care.\n\nThis suggests their potential drift is not issue-based but rather based on their views of the parties as institutions.\n\nTrends in partisanship appear confined to a Democratic bleed into independence and non-partisanship, a long-standing if growing feature among younger and Latino voters.\n\nYounger voters are SIGNIFICANTLY more independent, and less Democratic or Republican than more established voters.\n\nIn NET, Trump is doing not much better than he did in 2020 among Latino registered voters. But President Biden is doing worse, with Democratic erosion moving to \u201cundecided.\u201d\n\nMeaningful outreach and effective engagement with these voters will be decisive.\n\nThe Latino Vote Briefing Series, a program of UnidosUS\u2019s Latino Vote Initiative, is designed to provide accurate information about Hispanic voters and their priorities, tackle mistaken assumptions about this electorate and fuel effective engagement and response to their priorities. The series of virtual briefings will feature presentations and Q&A sessions with issue and election trends experts on critical topics shaping Latino voter perspectives and sentiment this election year.",

        "text": "Here's everything you need to know about the upcoming presidential debates\nFor months, voters, journalists and political observers wondered whether President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump would meet face to face this year for debates ahead of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nOn Wednesday, both campaigns finally committed to at least two debates, which will look different in several ways from what we're used to. Here's everything you need to know about who will participate, when to watch and how these debates came together.\n\nWhen are Trump and Biden set to debate?\n\nThe campaigns agreed on two dates: June 27 and Sept. 10. The June debate will take place in Atlanta, Georgia, at 9 p.m. ET. Details about the time and place of the September debate have not yet been announced.\n\nWho will moderate the debates?\n\nCNN is set to host the first debate, with anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash serving as co-moderators.\n\nABC News will host the second debate in September, with anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis as co-moderators.\n\nWhere can I watch the debates?\n\nBoth networks plan to air the debate on linear TV, while ABC News announced that the September debate would also be available on its streaming network, ABC News Live, as well as Hulu. ABC also said it would allow other broadcast and streaming networks to simulcast its debate.\n\nWho is leading the presidential polls ahead of the first debate?\n\nMost recent national and battleground state polls indicate a tight race in head-to-head matchups between Biden and Trump, with the former president faring better in the surveys but the race still close.\n\nA Fox News national poll out this week found that 49% of registered voters said they would vote for Trump, while 48% of those voters said they would vote for Biden.\n\nWhat are the debate rules, restrictions and conditions?\n\nBoth CNN and ABC News have announced that candidates must meet certain requirements and polling thresholds to appear on the debate stage.\n\nIn addition to meeting constitutional requirements and registering as a candidate with the Federal Election Commission, both news organizations are requiring that candidates are on the ballot in enough states to reach at least 270 electoral votes, that candidates \"accept the rules and format of the debate,\" and that candidates receive at least 15% in four national polls of registered or likely voters.\n\nWill any other candidates, like Robert Kennedy Jr. or Cornel West, participate in the debates?\n\nThe above requirements imposed by the TV networks make it hard for Kennedy or West, both of whom are running as independents, to make it onto the debate stage. But Kennedy has announced his intention to try.\n\nFirst, the polling threshold will likely exclude West and other third-party contenders other than Kennedy. While Kennedy has exceeded 15% in two qualifying polls already, no other contender has.\n\nMeanwhile, Kennedy has been working for months to collect petition signatures in states around the country. States differ in how many signatures are needed before a candidate can be placed on the presidential ballot.\n\nKennedy is already on the ballot in states totaling 85 electoral votes, and between his campaign and the pro-Kennedy super PAC, they say they have the signatures for an additional 11 states that have another 129 electoral votes. But announcing having the signatures and getting those signatures verified and earning ballot placement are different things, and each state has its own deadlines, rules and procedures for getting on the ballot.\n\nIn a statement posted to X on Wednesday, formerly known as Twitter, Kennedy was confident that he would meet the debate requirements by the deadline.\n\nMeanwhile, West has gotten on the ballot in at least six states so far.\n\nHow will the CNN and ABC News debates differ?\n\nAside from differing moderators and differing questions, CNN has announced that it will not allow an audience to be present at their June debate. In a news release Wednesday, the news organization said that they were barring an audience \"to ensure candidates may maximize the time allotted in the debate.\"\n\nABC News has not announced whether it will allow an audience at the September debate.\n\nWill there be a vice presidential debate?\n\nThe Trump campaign hasn't yet announced his running mate or accepted an invitation to a vice presidential debate.\n\nOn Thursday, the Biden campaign said that Vice President Kamala Harris accepted an invitation from CBS for a vice presidential debate over the summer. The campaign and CBS agreed that the debate could be held on July 23 or Aug. 13. The July date would come just one week after the Republican convention, which could be where Trump names his running mate.\n\n\"We look forward to the Trump campaign accepting one of these dates so that the full debate calendar for this campaign can be set,\" a Biden campaign official told NBC News.\n\nWhat about the Commission on Presidential Debates?\n\nFor decades, the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates partnered with TV networks and news organizations to hold series of presidential debates in the weeks and months leading up to each Election Day.\n\nLate last year, the group announced three dates \u2014 one in September and two in October \u2014 for presidential debates. But the CNN and ABC News debates announced on Wednesday are not in partnership with the Commission on Presidential Debates.\n\nThe Trump campaign has previously criticized the CPD's debate timeline, arguing that with early voting, \"millions of Americans\" will have cast their votes before some of the debate dates set by the commission.\n\nIn a letter to the CPD Wednesday, ahead of the announcement of the ABC News and CNN debates, Biden campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon also argued that the debates should happen earlier.\n\nShe proposed that there should be one debate in June, \"after Donald Trump\u2019s New York criminal trial is likely to be over and after President Biden returns from meeting with world leaders at the G7 Summit,\" and one in early September, \"at the start of the fall campaign season, early enough to influence early voting, but not so late as to require the candidates to leave the campaign trail in the critical late September and October period.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the commission stood by its original dates, saying in a statement, \"We will continue to be ready to execute this plan.\u201d",

        "text": "Trump changes tone on mail-in ballots and other forms of early voting\nMarta Moehring voted the way she prefers in Nebraska\u2019s Republican primary Tuesday \u2014 in person, at her west Omaha polling place.\n\nShe didn\u2019t even consider taking advantage of the state\u2019s no-excuse mail-in ballot process. In fact, she would prefer to do away with mail-in voting altogether. She\u2019s convinced fraudulent mailed ballots cost former President Donald Trump a second term in 2020.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t trust it in general,\u201d Moehring, 62, said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re counted correctly.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Why Trump\u2019s statements on mail-in ballots, election results are \u2018extremely problematic\u2019\n\nBut now Republican officials \u2014 even, sometimes, Trump \u2014 are encouraging voters such as Moehring to cast their ballots by mail. The GOP has launched an effort to, in the words of one official, \u201ccorrect the narrative\u201d on mail voting and get those who were turned off to it by Trump to reconsider for this year\u2019s election.\n\nThe push is a striking change for a party that amplified dark rumors about mail ballots to explain away Trump\u2019s 2020 loss, but it is also seen as a necessary course correction for an election this year that is likely to be decided by razor-thin margins in a handful of swing states.\n\n\u201cWe have to get right on using these mail-in ballots for the people who can\u2019t get there on Election Day,\u201d Rep. Scott Perry, one of Trump\u2019s strongest congressional allies in his push to overturn the 2020 election, said at a conservative gathering in his home state of Pennsylvania.\n\nRepublicans once were at least as likely as Democrats to vote by mail, but Trump changed the dynamics in 2020. He preemptively began to argue that mail balloting was bad months before voting began in the presidential race.\n\nThat alarmed GOP strategists who saw mail voting as an advantage in campaigns because it lets them \u201cbank\u201d unreliable votes before Election Day and lowers the risk of turnout plummeting because of bad weather or other unpredictable factors at the polls. Trump\u2019s own campaign tried to sell Republicans on casting ballots by mail, but his voters listened to the then-president. In 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Democrats were vastly more likely to cast ballots by mail than Republicans.\n\nThe trend continued in 2022, and its costs were starkly illustrated in Arizona.\n\nThree top-of-the-ticket Republican candidates there who echoed Trump\u2019s lies about the unreliability of mail ballots encouraged their supporters to vote in person on Election Day. An election machine meltdown that day in one-third of the polling places in the state\u2019s most populous county led to huge lines and some would-be voters departing in frustration.\n\nThe three top Republicans all lost, including falling 17,000 votes short in the governor\u2019s race and 500 votes short in the one for attorney general.\n\nREAD MORE: More than 17 million Americans have already voted in the 2020 election\n\nThis time, Republicans say they\u2019re not going to risk leaving ballots behind. Trump\u2019s handpicked chair of the Republican National Committee, his daughter-in-law Lara Trump, has vowed to embrace all sorts of legal election methods to boost turnout that Trump falsely blamed for his 2020 loss, including so-called \u201cballot harvesting\u201d \u2014 letting people turn in mail ballots on the behalf of other voters.\n\n\u201cIn this election cycle, Republicans will beat Democrats at their own game, by leveraging every legal tactic at our disposal based on the rules of each state,\u201d Lara Trump said in an interview with The Associated Press.\n\nTurning Point Action, a prominent, pro-Trump group, is launching a $100 million campaign to reach infrequent voters in the swing states of Arizona, Michigan and Wisconsin. That will include offering mail voting as one way to make casting a ballot easier, spokesman Andrew Kolvet said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d love for elections to be run the way they were before,\u201d Kolvet said. \u201cWe can spend our time complaining about it or we can get in gear and play by the rules that Democrats, or largely Democrats, used.\u201d\n\nEven Trump himself has started to recommend mail voting, though he frequently bashes it during campaign events and blames it for his 2020 loss. The RNC is also continuing to file lawsuits against various aspects of mail voting around the country.\n\nNonetheless, Trump recorded a short video telling his supporters that \u201cabsentee voting, early voting and Election Day voting are all good options.\u201d\n\nOne recent push to publicize mail voting came during last month\u2019s Pennsylvania primary, when the Republican State Legislative Committee teamed up with a committee supporting the party\u2019s Senate candidate and the state GOP. The goal, said RSLC political director Max Docksey, was \u201cto correct the narrative among Republican voters on mail voting.\u201d\n\nThe effort was inspired by what the RSLC saw as a successful effort to increase mail voting among Republicans in the battle for control of the Virginia Legislature in 2023, a fight ultimately won by the Democrats.\n\nREAD MORE: States take lessons from chaotic primary season to prepare for an unprecedented election\n\nThe group sent mail ballot applications to 1.5 million GOP voters, sent 475,000 text messages encouraging mail voting and touted the benefits of mail voting at party gatherings.\n\nBut at the same time, Pennsylvania Republicans have sued to force the state\u2019s mail ballots to be counted at polling places rather than the county election offices, which have the equipment and space to do the job, That\u2019s among many lawsuits targeting mail voting filed by Republicans around the country since 2020.\n\nThe conflicting messages could make it challenging to swiftly reverse the drop-off in mail voting among Republicans.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, Republican operatives were pleased with their effort, which they said led to them adding nearly twice as many voters to the state\u2019s mail ballot list as Democrats did during the primary. But the overall share of Pennsylvania mail ballots sent by Republicans remained about the same as in 2020, at only one-quarter of overall ballots, according to data from the secretary of state\u2019s office.\n\nBill Bretz, chairman of the Westmoreland County Republican Party in the western side of the state, said he\u2019s noticed voters in his conservative area slowly but steadily warming up to mail voting.\n\n\u201cPeople understand the consequences of this election,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of buy-in to vote by any method available, and the vote-by-mail bogeyman is beginning to fade.\u201d",

        "text": "Republicans vow a robust 'ballot harvesting' operation after years of protest and fraud claims\nAfter years of railing against the practice of collecting and delivering other voters\u2019 ballots, Republicans are vowing to mount their own \u201cballot harvesting\u201d operation ahead of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nFollowing Democrats\u2019 success encouraging their supporters to use alternative voting methods in recent elections, Republicans are seeking to change their tune on practices like mail-in voting and \u201cballot harvesting,\u201d as conservatives have derisively referred to it in the past, seeking to close the gap.\n\nBut the GOP\u2019s effort is running up against base voters who are skeptical of the practice, as well as laws to prevent ballot collection in key states that the party itself pushed.\n\nIn a Newsmax interview in late April, Republican National Committee co-chair Lara Trump said the party\u2019s ballot collection plans are \u201cwell underway.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe plans for that are going to be huge,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re firing on all cylinders.\u201d\n\nAn RNC official, who requested anonymity to speak candidly, said the party is focusing its efforts on the battleground states of Arizona, Nevada, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia and North Carolina. But thanks in part to Republicans around the country who have long claimed that ballot collection is a vehicle for fraud, the practice of having political volunteers or operatives collect and deliver ballots for other voters is explicitly legal in just one of those states, Nevada.\n\nBallot collection by anyone other than a close relative was banned by Republican-controlled legislatures in Arizona in 2016 and Georgia in 2021.\n\nIt\u2019s been illegal for nonfamily members to return voters\u2019 ballots in North Carolina and Michigan for years. In Pennsylvania, only voters who are disabled or casting an emergency absentee ballot can designate someone else to return their ballots.\n\nAnd in Wisconsin, where Republicans have previously fought to ban ballot harvesting and the use of drop boxes, the law describes voters transporting their own ballots. State Republicans say they may encourage their supporters to start embracing ballot harvesting and the use of absentee ballot drop boxes if the state Supreme Court, as expected, reverses its ruling that banned most of them.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t like drop boxes, to be clear,\u201d the RNC official said. \u201cWe\u2019re still going to use drop boxes if we have to, if they\u2019re available. Same thing with harvesting: Where it\u2019s a practice that Democrats are partaking in, we\u2019re going to partake in it, too.\u201d\n\nBallot collection was historically popular in minority communities \u2014 like Native American reservations where postal service is limited \u2014 or states with a high number of voters who cast ballots by mail. But the practice has gained notoriety in recent years thanks to both credible instances of voter fraud and baseless allegations of stolen elections.\n\nIn 2018, a Republican operative on a North Carolina congressional campaign was accused of illegally collecting voters\u2019 ballots, resulting in the state\u2019s election board ordering the election to be held again.\n\nAfter Donald Trump refused to accept his 2020 election loss to Joe Biden, he and his supporters falsely claimed that widespread ballot collection had occurred. A since-debunked film, \u201c2000 Mules,\u201d claimed that Democratic-aligned \u201cmules\u201d were paid to collect and drop off ballots in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nAnd last year, a court ordered a do-over of a mayoral primary in Bridgeport, Connecticut, after evidence of illegal ballot collection emerged.\n\nIn Nevada, Republican officials say they are planning to go door to door collecting ballots, as well as spending time in areas like retirement communities and churches to offer voters assistance in delivering their ballots.\n\n\u201cWhen they changed the rules, you either adapt and change your strategy, or you lose,\u201d said Washoe County GOP Chair Bruce Parks. \u201cLast election cycle, we didn\u2019t adapt to the new rules like we should have. That will not be the case this election cycle.\u201d\n\nParks said his local party started its ballot harvesting efforts in Washoe County, which has just under half a million residents, during the presidential primary season earlier this year, making inroads at long-term care facilities and retirement communities that they think will be ripe environments for ballot collection in November. Once mail ballots have been dispatched, the party will encourage voters to hand-deliver their ballots or give them to volunteers.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not going to adapt, you\u2019re going to die. We have to adapt. Is it distasteful? Do we consider it cheating? Absolutely,\u201d Parks said. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t do it, and you know for sure that the opposition is heavily involved in doing it, then you\u2019re setting yourself up for failure.\u201d\n\n\u2018Change of mindset\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s those very concerns that Parks described that may make ballot collection difficult work for Republicans this cycle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a change of mindset,\u201d said one county party chair, who was granted anonymity speak candidly. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a significant number of people \u2014 Republicans \u2014 who would not trust their ballot to anybody, no matter what. \u2026 That\u2019s an obstacle you have to overcome.\u201d\n\nLeo Blundo, chair of the Nye County Republican Party in Nevada, said his local party has been working to ramp up its grassroots efforts and using RNC messaging to \u201cbank your vote.\u201d He said he has more than a hundred volunteers prepared to turn out voters in the county of just over 51,000 residents.\n\n\u201cAt the local level, it\u2019s about fostering that credibility and trust with people,\u201d Blundo said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been rebranding and rebuilding the local Republican Party now for the last cycle.\u201d\n\nHe said mail voting is simpler than driving voters to the polls.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just easy \u2014 I can just give you my ballot and be done with it,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen urging voters to vote by mail, Blundo said he tells voters about a county commissioner race that was won by one vote.\n\n\u201cI know the lady who was supposed to go vote but she was like, yeah, then I got in a car wreck,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s really unfortunate, but every vote counts.\u201d\n\nIn Esmeralda County, which has just 729 people, county GOP Chairwoman Theresa Moller said she plans to have at least a half dozen people collect ballots at churches and go door to door. While in the past she\u2019s helped people deliver their ballots when asked, she said this year\u2019s effort will be more robust.\n\n\u201cHey, if they\u2019re going to ballot harvest, we\u2019re going to ballot harvest,\u201d she said in a phone interview.\n\nMoller expressed doubts about the integrity of state elections and ballot collection, but said she\u2019d send out people who are well-known in their community and will be trusted by voters.\n\nSeveral Nevada county party chairs said they would encourage ballot collection and discourage voters from using the mail service, which they worried is unreliable \u2014 particularly after the United States Postal Service announced it would move its Reno distribution center to California. (The change won\u2019t take effect until after the 2024 election, the Reno Gazette Journal reported.)\n\nDemocrats, for their part, have long enjoyed successes in mail voting, fueled in part by ballot collection where it is legal. The Democratic National Committee said it plans to spend \u201ctens of millions of dollars\u201d in support of voting programs like mail and early voting.\n\nIn a statement, it criticized the RNC\u2019s handling of mail voting more broadly.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump and his MAGA minions continue to attack mail-in voting while the RNC is actively deploying an army of lawyers to make it harder for Americans\u2019 ballots to be counted,\u201d Alex Floyd, the DNC\u2019s rapid response director, said in a statement.\n\nThe RNC has filed a number of election lawsuits this year, including one in Nevada to block the state from counting mail ballots received up to four days after the election as long as they have a postmark before the close of polls.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear about what this is: the RNC and Trump\u2019s newly installed team of hard-core election deniers like [RNC Chair] Michael Whatley and Lara Trump aren\u2019t just trying to make it harder to vote \u2014 they\u2019re trying to undermine this entire election just like they did in 2020,\u201d Floyd said.\n\nAnd while a robust ballot collection effort is new to Nevada Republicans, California Republicans have been utilizing the practice for years.\n\nTwo weeks before the 2022 election, California Republicans identified 18,000 people with GOP voting records who hadn\u2019t yet cast a ballot. They started repeatedly contacting those voters and collecting mail ballots in hopes of electing Modesto Republican John Duarte in an open and competitive congressional race.\n\nThe state GOP\u2019s ground game paid off: They saw a 34% uptick in votes cast before Election Day that year. Duarte won his district \u2014 which The Associated Press reported has a 14-point Democratic registration advantage \u2014 by just 564 votes.",

Donald Trump, in office from 2017-2021, has secured enough delegates to clinch the Republican nomination, setting up the first presidential rematch in nearly 70 years. Biden faced no serious challenger for the party's nomination, which he clinched in March.(AFP)\n\nHere is a list of the candidates:\n\nREPUBLICAN PARTY\n\nDonald Trump, in office from 2017-2021, has secured enough delegates to clinch the Republican nomination, setting up the first presidential rematch in nearly 70 years.\n\nHe has leveraged his unprecedented legal challenges to solidify support among his base and has cast his third bid for the White House in part as retribution against perceived political enemies. He calls supporters jailed for the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol \"hostages\" and campaigns using increasingly dystopian rhetoric. He has refused to commit to accepting the election results or to rule out possible violence around the Nov. 5 contest, and is already laying the groundwork to contest his potential election loss.\n\nTrump, 77, faces 88 charges in four criminal cases over efforts to subvert the 2020 election, retaining classified documents after leaving office and alleged efforts to cover up a hush money payment to a porn star.\n\nHe denies wrongdoing in all the cases, including the New York hush-money criminal trial, which could be the only one to begin before the Nov. 5 election.\n\nHe has called the charges a Democratic conspiracy to prevent him from winning. The U.S. Justice Department denies any political interference. If elected to another four-year term, Trump has vowed revenge on his political enemies and said he would not be a dictator except \"on day one,\" later calling that \"a joke.\" He also wants the power to replace federal civil service workers with loyalists. Trump sparked criticism from Western leaders for saying the U.S. would not defend NATO members that did not spend enough on defense and would encourage Russia to attack them. He also pressed congressional Republicans to stall military aid for Ukraine before later reversing course. Trump has made immigration his top domestic campaign issue, declaring he would carry out mass deportations, utilize the National Guard and possibly federal troops, end birthright citizenship, and expand a travel ban on people from certain countries. He has referred to migrants as \"animals\" and has not ruled out building detention camps on U.S. soil. On abortion, Trump takes credit for the U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade and has said it should remain a state issue. While he has criticized some Republican-led state actions such as Florida's six-week abortion ban, he said he would allow Republican-led states to track women's pregnancies and prosecute those who violate their state bans.\n\nHe had promised to eliminate Obamacare health insurance before saying in an April 11 video that he would not \"terminate\" it. He has also vowed to undo much of the Biden administration\u2019s work to fight climate change. Trump has yet to announce a vice presidential running mate, but several possibilities have been floated. Mike Pence, who ran alongside Trump in 2016 and 2020 but was targeted by Trump and his supporters amid the Jan. 6 attack, refused to endorse him in November's contest.\n\nDEMOCRATIC PARTY\n\nJOE BIDEN Biden launched his 2020 candidacy as an urgent bid to defend American liberties and protect democracy and has cast his reelection bid in the same light, saying Trump threatens the future of American democracy.\n\nBiden faced no serious challenger for the party's nomination, which he clinched in March. November's election will be much tougher, with the most recent Reuters/Ipsos poll putting both Biden and Trump's voter support at 40% of registered voters. Other polling shows the incumbent trailing Trump in crucial battleground states. Biden, already the oldest U.S. president ever at 81, must convince voters he is more fit for office than Trump, who is just four years younger, while combating low approval ratings.\n\nThe economy will also factor in Biden's reelection campaign. While the U.S. escaped an anticipated recession and is growing faster than economists expected, inflation and the cost of essentials are weighing on voters. Biden pushed through massive economic stimulus and infrastructure spending packages to boost U.S. industrial output, but has received little recognition from voters so far as his campaign moves to highlight new semiconductor manufacturing plants, housing plans and other economic efforts. Biden has said he wants to compete with China, not launch a trade war, and moved to keep tariffs put in place by Trump while ratcheting up others on an array of Chinese imports. Two labor groups, the United Auto Workers union and the North America's Building Trade Union, have endorsed his reelection bid with Vice President Kamala Harris. Biden's handling of immigration policy has been criticized by Republicans and Democrats as migrant crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border hit record highs. He has led the response of Western governments to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, persuading allies to punish Russia and support Kyiv, and secured additional funding in April after a months-long battle with congressional Republicans. Biden has also provided military aid to Israel in its conflict with Hamas while urging more humanitarian assistance, but he has faced sharp criticism from some Democrats over his handling of both the war in Gaza and the U.S. campus protests against it that Reuters/Ipsos polling shows has divided the party. In May, Biden paused shipments of certain weapons to Israel amid continued efforts to pursue a ceasefire, while Israel has vowed a ground operation in Rafah.\n\nMARIANNE WILLIAMSON Best-selling author and self-help guru Marianne Williamson, 71, relaunched her long-shot 2024 presidential bid focusing on \"justice and love\" less than one month after dropping out.\n\nIn a February statement, she said she was getting back in to fight Trump's \"dark and authoritarian vision\" after earlier suspending it because she was losing \"the horse race.\"\n\nWilliamson previously ran as a Democrat in the 2020 presidential primary but dropped out of that race before any votes were cast.\n\nINDEPENDENTS\n\nROBERT F. KENNEDY JR\n\nAn anti-vaccine activist and environmental advocate, Kennedy, 70, is running as an independent after initially challenging Biden for the Democratic nomination. While he lags in overall polling, Kennedy could siphon votes from Trump and Biden, with the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll showing he was backed by 8% of registered voters, a seven-percentage-point drop from March. The son of U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1968 during his own presidential bid, Kennedy has drawn rebukes from his famous family, which has publicly backed Biden. Kennedy, who chose wealthy lawyer Nicole Shanahan as his running mate, supports Israel and has questioned a six-week ceasefire backed by Biden.\n\nHe said he views the U.S. southern border situation as a humanitarian crisis and opposes Trump's border wall. He has also vowed to repeal parts of Biden's climate bill over tax breaks he says help the oil industry. Kennedy has taken different positions on abortion rights, including restrictions on when a woman can access an abortion. He told Reuters he thought every abortion was a \"tragedy\" but that it should be a woman's right \"throughout the pregnancy.\" He has been criticized for making false medical claims over the years on vaccines but says he would still allow Americans to have access to them. He himself had a brain worm more than a decade ago but has fully recovered, his campaign said in May.\n\nKennedy's campaign has said he is officially on the ballot in a handful of states so far, including California, Michigan and Utah, although he faces a challenging, costly battle to be listed in all 50.\n\nCORNEL WEST\n\nThe political activist, philosopher and academic is making a third-party bid for president that is most likely to appeal to progressive, Democratic-leaning voters.\n\nWest, 70, initially ran as a Green Party candidate but, in October, he said people \"want good policies over partisan politics\" and announced his bid as an independent. He has promised to end poverty and guarantee housing.\n\nJILL STEIN\n\nJill Stein, a physician who ran under the Green Party in 2016, is trying once again in 2024.\n\nShe launched her current campaign accusing Democrats of betraying their promises \"for working people, youth and the climate again and again - while Republicans don\u2019t even make such promises in the first place.\"\n\nStein, 73, raised millions of dollars for recounts after Trump's surprise 2016 victory. Her allegations yielded only one electoral review in Wisconsin, which showed Trump had won.

        "text": "Voting Laws Roundup: May 2024\nRestrictive Legislation\n\nBetween January 1 and May 3, Alabama, Idaho, and Indiana enacted extensive restrictions on voting access, and three other states added restrictions that are likely to have less wide-ranging effects. Overall, lawmakers in 40 states have considered at least 291 restrictive bills for the 2024 legislative session.\n\nAlabama and Idaho passed laws that broadly criminalize certain forms of assistance with absentee voting, the former relating to mail ballot applications and the latter to completed mail ballots. Constraints on mail voting assistance fall hardest on elderly voters, voters with disabilities, and voters with limited access to transportation.\n\nAlabama\u2019s new law imposes criminal penalties on any person who submits another voter\u2019s mail ballot application. It also makes it a crime to distribute a pre-filled absentee ballot application or to receive or provide payment or a gift for distributing, collecting, or submitting a mail ballot application. Interpreted broadly, the latter provision could impose criminal penalties for providing postage stamps or gas money to a neighbor who distributes absentee ballot applications. It could also be read to prohibit civic engagement groups \u2014 which often pay their staff or give their volunteers token gifts such as stickers \u2014 from assisting absentee voters. The law makes limited exceptions for voters undergoing medical treatment or during declared states of emergency. It also makes a vague exception for voters who require assistance due to a disability or the inability to read or write, but it doesn\u2019t make clear what kind of assistance is permissible for such voters. Voting rights advocates have challenged the Alabama law in court.\n\nIdaho\u2019s new law makes it a crime for any person to collect or deliver another voter\u2019s mail ballot, except for election officials, postal workers, those who receive compensation, relatives, household members, and caregivers. Again, elderly voters, voters with disabilities, and voters with limited transportation are most likely to feel the effects of this change.\n\nIndiana enacted a law that heightens the chances that naturalized citizens will be wrongly removed from the voting rolls. The law requires election officials to compare voter registration information with Bureau of Motor Vehicles records to identify purported noncitizens. People they flag have 30 days to provide proof of citizenship or their registrations will be canceled. Hearings on the legislation included testimony that motor vehicle data is often outdated; indeed, more than 8,000 Indiana residents are naturalized each year, and those who take the oath of citizenship may still be marked as noncitizens in the database until they renew their licenses.\n\nIndiana\u2019s new law echoes a 2019 Texas policy that the state had to promptly rescind. Texas\u2019s secretary of state had announced that the state would require proof of citizenship from tens of thousands of registered voters who were allegedly noncitizens, but after multiple lawsuits pointed out that purging voters who are flagged as noncitizens using outdated motor vehicle data discriminated against naturalized citizens, the state revised the policy. Indiana\u2019s similar policy this year is part of a larger trend targeting noncitizen voting, which is a nonproblem, as we discuss below.\n\nAdditionally, three more states passed laws that increase barriers to voting \u2014 including two in Tennessee. The first new law in Tennessee shortens the deadline for requesting an absentee ballot by three days. The second imposes new requirements on voter registration organizations. Among other things, it limits who can assist others with registering to vote and establishes a fine of up to $5,000 for any organization or individual who violates the law, even inadvertently.\n\nAn Arizona law, which also has expansive provisions, shortens the period during which voters may fix issues with their signatures on mail ballots from five business days to five calendar days for federal elections. And West Virginia now requires county clerks to cancel the registrations of voters who get out-of-state driver\u2019s licenses \u2014 a burden on students, military members, and others who temporarily reside outside the state but intend to return and therefore remain eligible to vote in West Virginia.\n\nGovernors in two states used their veto power to prevent additional voting restrictions from becoming law. Lawmakers in Wisconsin passed a bill, discussed in our last roundup, that would have added several new grounds for not counting mail ballots, including minor technical errors such as a missing zip code. In his veto message, the governor observed that the bill would have required \u201call ballots with even the most inconsequential mistakes to be discarded.\u201d The Arizona legislature took aim at student voters by passing a bill, which the governor vetoed, that would have barred election officials from issuing voter registration cards to addresses outside the state.\n\nAs of May 3, 28 bills are still moving through 12 state legislatures. Among these, a proposal in Georgia has passed both chambers of the legislature and is awaiting the governor\u2019s signature or veto. The Georgia bill would make it easier for private citizens to challenge someone\u2019s eligibility to vote based on unreliable data, increasing the chances that eligible voters would have their registrations canceled.",

        "text": "Democracy is a top concern for many voters. We asked them why.\nWhile it's practically a given that economic issues rank as the most important to voters, and policy issues like immigration and public safety have surged in salience over the past year, there's another issue close on their heels \u2014 one that may be harder to define: American voters are worried and depressed about the state of their democracy.\n\nVoters were evenly split when asked in a January YouGov/CBS News poll whether having a strong economy or having a functioning democracy was a bigger concern in the coming years, and research from Ipsos suggests that concerns about threats to democracy might even be greater than many traditional issue polls capture. Overall, polls have consistently shown that both Democrats and Republicans think democracy is at risk in the coming election, but largely for different reasons.\n\nPartnering with 538, nonpartisan research firm PerryUndem recently conducted a set of focus groups with swing-state voters who identified as undecided ahead of the 2024 presidential election \u2014 one group leaning toward voting for President Joe Biden and one leaning toward former President Donald Trump \u2014 to delve deeper into what voters think about the state of our democracy. As we did with our focus group questions about \"the economy,\" we asked these voters what they meant when they expressed concerns about \"democracy,\" and how those concerns impacted their decision-making on whom to support in the upcoming election.\n\nThese focus groups found that the economy was indeed top of mind for undecided voters, and that those leaning toward Trump thought the economy was a point of strength for him \u2026 but Biden leaners tended to agree. Democracy turned out to be key in answering why those voters were inclined to vote for Biden nonetheless, as their differing opinions on what factors posed the biggest threat to democracy drove each group toward opposite candidates.\n\nVoters feel unrepresented, with little recourse\n\nAcross the board, voters were deeply frustrated over the state of democracy, suggesting that the country was off on the wrong track and expressing pessimism about whether it could improve. They were also dissatisfied with the candidates they had to choose from. Democracy \"won't get better in our lifetime,\" one voter said. Several participants from both groups expressed the idea that the government was not representing the will of the people or the needs of \"middle-class taxpayers.\"\n\nMany also said that Democrats and Republicans needed to work together more and were concerned about what they saw as deep partisan divides both in Washington and across the country. And perhaps unsurprisingly for a group of voters who hadn't fully committed to either candidate, they all wished they had more choices in whom to vote for and believed democracy would be better served if there were more than two major parties.\n\n\"I'm undecided because I don't want any of them,\" a voter from North Carolina who was leaning toward Biden said. \"But a vote for a third party is just going to \u2026 take away from A or B's votes.\"\n\nA Trump leaner from the same state agreed with her. \"The fact that we are limited to these two parties, and the people who are running from those two parties \u2026 everybody here is trying to figure out who is the lesser of the two evils,\" she said. \"I think if we were truly democratic we would not be limited. We would be able to vote for whoever we thought would do the best job and not be worried about throwing our votes away.\"\n\nBut despite \u2014 or perhaps in a good illustration of \u2014 their shared frustrations with the two-party system, the two groups still split strongly on partisan lines when it came to what, or who, was at fault. In fact, it seemed like concerns about democracy were a determining factor in which candidate some voters were leaning toward.\n\nOverall, these voters put voice to what polls on the topic have found: Democratic leaners are worried about a repeat of Jan. 6, and that electing Trump for a second time could mean the end of democracy as we know it \u2014 some to the point that this is a deciding factor in their potential support for Biden. By contrast, Republican leaners are more worried about the chances of election fraud, and many seem convinced by Trump's repeated false claims that the 2020 election was stolen.\n\nBiden leaners have deep fears about a second Trump presidency\n\n\"I, for one, truly believe that if Donald Trump were to win this election, democracy as we know it is dead,\" one voter from Michigan said. \"Because he's got nothing to lose after that.\"\n\nIn a follow-up interview, the voter clarified that he saw the actions Trump took leading up to Jan. 6 as a coordinated effort to undermine the results of a free and fair election. He also pointed to Trump's rhetoric on the campaign trail about jailing political enemies as a sign of Trump's increasing lean toward authoritarianism. \"We have a demagogue here,\" he added. \"I'm very, very frightened that democracy is very seriously at risk.\"\n\nThis was a concise explanation of a feeling that many voters in the Biden-leaning group expressed, fueled by deep-seated fears that the things they disliked about Trump during and after his first presidency would be worse if he took office for a second time. In general, those fears were a big motivator for why this group wanted to vote against the former president \u2014 including because they believed he was a corrupt \"con artist,\" they were worried about the criminal trials he faces, and they felt that his nationalistic, racist rhetoric made the country unsafe for many.\n\nOne Black voter in Nevada said he had liked some of Trump's outsider messaging in 2016, when he promised to shake up the economic and political system, but became wary of him. \"If he is empowering folks to take me out, the economy won't do a damn thing for me,\" he said. Another Biden leaner from North Carolina said that human rights issues would probably be her deciding factor when she finally decided how to vote. \"I want my neighbors and myself to be treated well, regardless of race or sexual orientation, or whatever it might be, \" she said.\n\nThey were also extremely worried about how the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol may have created a precedent of questioning election results, and about a repeat of the insurrection if the results this November aren't what Trump and his supporters want to see.\n\n\"When I saw that, honestly, I cried,\" Claudia, a voter from Virginia, said when she remembered the storming of the Capitol. Voting, elections, and the electoral college have always worked the same way, she said. \"Why is it being questioned now? Because it was not in [Trump's] favor,\" she remembered thinking at the time.\n\nAnother potential Biden voter from North Carolina said he'd already heard Trump's campaign say that this election was \"going to draw blood\" \u2014 likely referring to Trump's comments predicting \"a bloodbath for the whole country\" if he loses in the fall \u2014 while the other voter from his state responded, \"How can that be good for our country? People acting like barbarians instead of grownups?\" The Michigan voter brought up the plot to kidnap and assassinate his state's governor, Gretchen Whitmer, as a similarly concerning event, saying \"craziness has been normalized\" after Trump's presidency.\n\nThese voters also had more long-standing, structural concerns that tended to align them with Democrats more broadly. Two Biden leaners agreed that the electoral college system didn't reflect the will of the majority of Americans and thought that a different system would allow more people's votes to count. The Nevada voter pointed to gerrymandering and state laws that have, historically and recently, made it harder for some to vote. \"This country has always been on some bullshit when it comes to voting,\" he said.\n\nTrump leaners are worried about election fraud\n\nWhile some voters leaning toward Trump expressed concerns about the former president's temperament or integrity, they didn't necessarily see him as a threat to democracy. When asked why they were concerned about the state of democracy in the country, some expressed a feeling of \"chaos\" fueled by wars abroad and political divisions at home \u2014 but they didn't blame Trump for these issues. Many were concerned about general corruption and lack of accountability in government, like one who said partisanship led to the spread of misinformation. \"Because each party is so invested in their party's side, you can't even speak the obvious truth about something,\" he said. And when asked specifically about elections, their answers seemed to reflect Trump and Republicans' messaging around election integrity and voter fraud.\n\nA Trump-leaning voter from North Carolina said that she heard there are \"all these people who are running past our border, and then we're turning around and giving them money \u2026 and letting them vote in elections.\" Another from Wisconsin added that she had \"no confidence in the way [election officials] run their elections,\" specifying, \"When you have dead people supposedly voting, I think there's a problem.\" And a voter from Arizona said he didn't like the pushback against voter ID laws and didn't believe that they were racist, as some opponents say they are. \"Why would you [oppose the laws] unless you want someone to be able to vote that isn't \u2026 a United States citizen?\" he asked.\n\nIt's important to note that almost every systemic analysis has found that voter fraud is exceedingly rare and is punished when it does happen. Even some Trump allies have disputed his claims about the 2020 election, and exhaustive reviews of that election have found that Trump's claims are false. But these voters' doubts in election integrity suggest that Republican rhetoric about potential voter fraud, like House Speaker Mike Johnson's claim that \"we all know intuitively\" that undocumented immigrants are voting in federal elections, is powerful, even if it hasn't been proven.\n\nThe Trump leaners also seemed to be swayed by Republicans' messaging regarding the Jan. 6 insurrection, even if their initial reactions mirrored those of Biden leaners. One voter from Nevada said that while he believes entering the Capitol was wrong, he initially thought the insurrection was \"horrific and frightening\" but now sees that reaction as \"quite extreme,\" emphasizing that \"there are things that happened that weren't as what they first appeared.\" The Arizona voter agreed with him, saying the fault for Jan. 6 lay with the people who actually entered the Capitol and that we don't know all the facts about what happened that day, alluding to the conspiracy theory that federal agents were involved in instigating the insurrection.\n\n***\n\nIn all, Republican-leaning voters in our focus group felt that elections can't be trusted. And voters leaning toward the Democrats worry that this same distrust will cause Republicans to deny future election results and could prompt another Jan. 6 \u2014 an event that has left them doubting the strength of American democracy as well.\n\nWhat ultimately keeps these voters from being firmly in one camp or another is that they have doubts about the individual candidates each party offers and how they speak to their issues; they largely expressed a level of distrust in both Biden and Trump as politicians in a failing political system. All would prefer a theoretical candidate that a multi-party system might offer them, and the fact that they don't have that option might be the most fundamental cause of their dissatisfaction.\n\nHowever, when faced with the two options they're almost certain to have in November, how these voters feel about threats to democracy, and which candidate they think poses a greater danger to it, may be a deciding factor. It will be no surprise if both parties continue to hammer home these issues to bolster their candidates' chances in November.",

        "text": "Have I Got News for You to launch in the US in autumn\nArch, ironic and understated, Have I Got News for You is the quintessential British comedy quiz, but its creators are hoping a US version of the show can translate its particular brand of political humour across the Atlantic.\n\nA US adaptation of the show will be broadcast by CNN in the autumn, to coincide with the presidential election. It will hit screens on Saturday nights \u2013 part of a double-bill with Bill Maher\u2019s Real Time.\n\nMark Thompson, the former BBC director general who is the chief executive at CNN, said both were \u201cvery, very smart shows\u201d.\n\nHe told Ad Week: \u201cThe idea is: let\u2019s see what Saturday nights are like when we\u2019re sitting back and enjoying and laughing at what\u2019s happening in the world \u2013 as well as still exploring it.\u201d\n\nIt is not the first time television executives have attempted to take the long-running British show \u2013 now in its 67th series \u2013 to a US audience. The comedian Sam Seder piloted versions in 2009 for NBC and then in 2012 for TBS \u2013 but both fell flat.\n\nCNN is yet to announce who will host the show, and who will feature as team captains \u2013 the latter roles having been occupied in the UK by Ian Hislop and Paul Merton since HIGNFY, as it is also known, launched in 1990.\n\nThe UK show was hosted by Angus Deayton from 1990 until 2002, but after a series of revelations about his private life the series has used guest hosts, including the comedian Jo Brand, the presenter Jeremy Clarkson and the former prime minister Boris Johnson.\n\nIn an interview with Televisual in 2016, the series producer, Jo Bunting, said the show did not use hosts \u201cfor novelty\u2019s sake\u201d, but added that some guests brought their own touch of magic.\n\nShe said: \u201cTwo of my favourite shows were the ones hosted by Brian Blessed (\u201cI\u2019LL BE SPEAKING AT ABOUT THIS LEVEL. IS THAT OK?\u201d) and William Shatner (\u201cRemind me what the show\u2019s called? \u201cWhat Have You Been Up To Lately?\u201d).\u201d\n\nHat Trick Productions, the company behind the series, will make the US version. Its co-founder and executive producer, Jimmy Mulville, said: \u201cTo bring Have I Got News for You to such an iconic network as CNN is a great honour and career highlight for us all at Hat Trick.\u201d In keeping with the spirit of the show, he added: \u201cI just hope there will be something interesting going on in the fall for us to talk about!\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Guide Free weekly newsletter Get our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every Friday Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

[HuffPost] GIFFORDS sues the NRA. The FEC dragged its feet on addressing these allegations, so GIFFORDS and CLC sought to compel the agency to investigate these millions of dollars in illegal, unreported, and excessive in-kind contributions by filing a lawsuit against the FEC. In October 2021, a federal judge ruled that the FEC has 30 days to take action on the complaints. After no action was taken, on November 2, 2021, GIFFORDS sued the NRA. As of the beginning of 2024, the case is pending. [ABC News, Washington Post]\n\nNRA v. Ackerman McQueen\n\nNRA sues former ad firm Ackerman McQueen.

According to the NRA, the firm refused to turn over financial documents.

[The Trace]\n\nFinancial Corruption\n\nLaPierre\u2019s Lavish Spending\n\nAs explored above, the lawsuit New York\u2019s Attorney General Letitia James won against the NRA alleged that NRA leaders used organization funds for personal expenses. Unsurprisingly, Wayne LaPierre was among the worst financial abusers.\n\nWayne LaPierre lied about his yacht trip. When questioned by New York\u2019s attorney general about his alleged acceptance of lavish gifts, LaPierre testified under oath in 2021 that a luxury yacht he used in the Bahamas in 2013, provided by an NRA contractor for free, was for a \u201csecurity retreat\u201d because he believed his life was in imminent danger following the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre. He failed to disclose that his niece was getting married in the Bahamas, and that he and his wife used the yacht to attend the wedding and cruise around the Caribbean. In fact, LaPierre failed to list free yacht trips on NRA internal disclosure forms, as required by the organization\u2019s rules and New York State law, for almost 10 years.

[Wall Street Journal] Plans to buy Wayne LaPierre a mansion. Reports revealed that Wayne LaPierre feared for his life after the mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, and determined that the solution was to have the NRA buy him a $6 million Dallas mansion, with Ackerman McQueen assisting in facilitating the transaction and maintaining the property after closing. While the deal ultimately fell through, had it not, the organization would have been a 99% owner of LaPierre\u2019s residence. [Wall Street Journal]\n\nAn Absence of Employee Appreciation\n\nLeadership payouts.

[NPR]\n\nWaning Membership\n\nTax filings reveal just how far the NRA has fallen. In an analysis of the last 15 years of the organization\u2019s tax filings, The Daily Beast reported that the NRA is experiencing a \u201cswift and dramatic\u201d collapse. It\u2019s been declining for years across numerous metrics, including revenue, assets, member dues, lobbying, and political spending, while there have been sharp increases in legal costs and deficits.

According to a financial report released at the NRA\u2019s 2022 convention in Houston, NRA member revenue has plunged to lows not seen since 2006. Then CEO Wayne LaPierre defended this drop by blaming gas prices and inflation, despite the fact that the most recent membership revenue decline began in 2018. Also included in the report is a staggering $52 million\u2014or 21% of total spending\u2014on legal fees and related costs in 2021 alone.

[The Trace] NRA\u2019s CEO and president trade punches. The dispute between then NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre and NRA President Oliver North was closely tied to the organization\u2019s lawsuit against its former ad agency, Ackerman McQueen. North aligned himself with Ackerman McQueen and attempted to oust LaPierre, accusing him of mishandling NRA funds and threatening to go to the board with incriminating information. LaPierre retaliated with claims that this was payback for the lawsuit and eventually won the power struggle when North resigned. [HuffPost, Rolling Stone, Washington Post]\n\nMass Shootings\n\nNRA tweets appalling post on the Fourth of July. The same day that an armed citizen killed seven people and injured dozens more in Highland Park, Illinois, in 2022, the NRA tweeted that American celebrations of Independence Day are the result of arming citizens. The tweet was not deleted, and it gained attention as residents of the town were sheltering in place during the manhunt for the shooter.

        "text": "Billionaire investor Ray Dalio warns U.S. is \u2018on the brink\u2019 and estimates a more than one in three chance of civil war\nBillionaire investor Ray Dalio believes the chances of a second American Civil War stand better than one out of three and is urging investors to move part of their assets out of the country.\n\nDalio, who founded the world\u2019s largest hedge fund Bridgewater Associates before relinquishing control in September 2022, believes this year\u2019s presidential election between incumbent Joe Biden and challenger Donald Trump is the most important one of his lifetime and be serve as a litmus test that determines whether risks spiral out of control.\n\n\u201cWe are now on the brink,\u201d he told the Financial Times in an interview published on Thursday, estimating the probability of strife erupting at somewhere between 35% to 40%.\n\nCivil war seemed inconceivable only a few years ago. But the Jan. 6 scenes of angry mobs sacking the Capitol\u2014beamed into living rooms and narrated by a British ITV news team in real time\u2014were all too reminiscent of political revolts in developing nations.\n\nThe idea of a \u201cnational divorce\u201d, proposed last year by Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, has since been brought to the silver screen by director Alex Garland in the simply named Civil War released in April. A Rasmussen poll conducted shortly thereafter suggested 41% of likely U.S. voters believe they will experience a civil war sometime in the next five years.\n\nNovember\u2019s election and the reactions to it will play a crucial role in determining whether the system can still heal itself\u2014or pessimistic U.S: voters are right.\n\n\u201cWill there be an acceptance of the rules and an ability to work well under those rules?\u201d the Bridgewater founder asked.\n\n\u2018Best parts of the United States\u2019 still attractive for investments\n\nPolitical scientist Barbara F. Walter, author of How Civil Wars Start: And How to Stop Them, says people like Dalio can defend democracy through a more holistic approach to capitalism that pours money into communities left behind by globalization.\n\n\u201cBusinesses can invest in better healthcare, better education and a higher minimum wage so that they create a group of people who are hopeful about the future and less vulnerable to the calls by extremists to burn the system down,\u201d she argued in a TED talk last April.\n\nDalio has a different idea, however\u2014stay invested only in what the hedge funder called \u201cthe best parts of the United States\u201d where innovation and capitalism still thrive, and move the rest of your money out of the country to jurisdictions that are more stable and attractive.\n\n\u201cCountries that earn more than they spend and have great balance sheets, have internal order and are neutral in the geopolitical conflicts\u2026look attractive,\u201d said Dalio, suggesting India, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam and some Gulf states as possible destinations.\n\nOne of those heeding a similar call is Warren Buffett, who just revealed he took a $7 billion stake in Chubb, an American insurance company that relocated its operations from the U.S. to Switzerland in 2008.",

        "text": "Mitt Romney says he won't vote for Trump for president \u2013 Deseret News\nUtah Sen. Mitt Romney is hoping the Republican Party will shift away from the politics of former President Donald Trump, and wants to be part of influencing the change after he leaves office.\n\n\u201cMy wing of the party is like a chicken wing, all right? It\u2019s a little, tiny thing that doesn\u2019t take the bird off the ground. So we\u2019re going to have to change that in my view,\u201d Romney told MSNBC\u2019s Stephanie Ruhle in an interview that aired Wednesday night on the \u201c11th Hour.\u201d\n\nHow, or if, there will be a move from the MAGA beliefs currently dominating the GOP is not clear.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how that\u2019s going to play out over time,\u201d the Republican Party\u2019s 2012 presidential nominee acknowledged. \u201cBut there are going to be voices that come forward that I think will be more aligned with the traditional conservative views that I\u2019ve espoused, that our party has traditionally. We\u2019ll see. Time will tell. I can\u2019t predict what\u2019s going to happen in politics.\u201d\n\nIn this year\u2019s presidential race between Trump, a fellow Republican, and President Joe Biden, a Democrat, Romney said members of the GOP who agree with him about the direction of the party face a choice at the ballot box he believes they\u2019ll make \u201cvery reluctantly.\u201d\n\nThe senator, who is not seeking reelection this year, said Trump won\u2019t get his vote but declined to say who will. He cited the May 2023 court decision that found the former president liable for sexually abusing advice columnist E. Jean Carroll in 1996 as his reason he doesn\u2019t want to see Trump back in the White House.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not announcing that here and now,\u201c Romney said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be voting for President Trump. I\u2019ve made that clear. I know for some people, character is not the No. 1 issue. It is for me. When someone has been, well, determined by a jury to have committed sexual assault, that\u2019s not someone who I want my kids and grandkids to see as president of the United States.\u201d\n\nThe United States \u201ccan survive bad policy\u201d but can\u2019t lead the world with someone of bad character in charge, he said.\n\nPreviously, Romney has said he\u2019ll once again write in the name of his wife, Ann, for president, just like he did in the 2016 election. Romney did not vote for Trump in 2020. His biographer, McKay Coppins, wrote that Romney planned to write in Ann\u2019s name again that year for president, \u201cBut in private, he made little effort to conceal the fact that he was pulling for Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nPressed about whether he would follow through with voting for his wife again, Romney said, \u201cmy particular vote doesn\u2019t have a big impact because I\u2019m from Utah,\u201d a state that hasn\u2019t voted for a Democrat for president since 1964. His advice for voters, however, is to go with either Trump or Biden.\n\n\u201cIn my case, having been the former nominee of the Republican Party, I want to make sure that I\u2019m in a position after this election to have some influence on the direction of our party in the future. So I\u2019m not going to go out and do something which would make that more difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cI really think our party has to come back to the basis that has been successful for us in the past.\u201d\n\nSen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, meets with House Democrats during their caucus meeting at the Capitol in Salt Lake City on Thursday, Feb. 15, 2024. | Kristin Murphy, Deseret News\n\nDuring the pre-taped interview, Romney again said it\u2019s demeaning for Republican leaders to appear outside the New York courtroom where Trump is currently on trial over \u201chush money\u201d payments to an adult film actress, calling it terrible and a mistake for them to be \u201cattacking our legal system.\u201d\n\nHe also criticized Biden, saying the president should have pardoned Trump when the U.S. Justice Department indicted Trump in another criminal case that\u2019s awaiting trial. \u201cI\u2019d have pardoned President Trump,\u201d Romney said. \u201cWhy? Well, because it makes me, President Biden, the big guy and the person I pardoned a little guy.\u201d\n\nAnd Biden hasn\u2019t done enough to deal with the immigration crisis at the border with Mexico, he said.\n\nBiden \u201cshould be all over that. Instead, he served it up on a silver platter\u201d to Trump, who saw the issue work for his 2016 campaign and expects it to help him win this election, Romney said.\n\nTrump may have helped block a recent attempt at congressional action on the border, but Romney said \u201cwhen he was president, he did a lot of things that sounded pretty ugly, but we didn\u2019t have anywhere near the number of people that have come into the country illegally as we\u2019ve had under President Biden.\u201d\n\nStill, Romney remains optimistic.\n\n\u201cAmerica is an extraordinarily resilient country. We just had this extraordinary pandemic and yet our economy is strong, (with) low levels of unemployment,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not because the president is pulling all the levers the right way. No, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s because the American people are fulfilling their dreams.\u201d",

        "text": "What we know, and don't know, about the US presidential debates\nBy Jill Colvin and Zeke Miller, Associated Press\n\nPhoto: AP / Alex Brandon\n\nAfter months of questions about whether general election debates would happen, President Joe Biden and Republican nominee Donald Trump have agreed to participate in two of them: one in June and one in September.\n\nBut there are still some nitty-gritty details to be worked out, including the formats of the events and who will moderate. Here is what we know so far:\n\nThe details\n\nTrump and Biden have agreed to two debates. The first will held at [1pm NZT on 28 June] at CNN's studios in Atlanta, in a critical battleground state.\n\n\"To ensure candidates may maximise the time allotted in the debate, no audience will be present,\" CNN said in a statement. To qualify, candidates must receive at least 15 percent in four national polls of registered or likely voters that meet CNN's standards.\n\nAnchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash would moderate the debate, CNN said.\n\nThe second debate will take place on 10 September [September 11 in New Zealand] and will be hosted by ABC. While ABC has yet to detail where that debate will take place or the format, it set the same 15 percent polling threshold as CNN. Anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis will moderate that debate, the network said.\n\n\"It is my great honor to accept the CNN Debate against Crooked Joe Biden,\" Trump posted on his Truth Social site. \"Likewise, I accept the ABC News Debate against Crooked Joe on September 10th.\"\n\nBiden said he had done the same.\n\n\"Trump says he'll arrange his own transportation,\" Biden wrote on X. \"I'll bring my plane, too. I plan on keeping it for another four years.\"\n\nThe timing\n\nThe first debate will play out in a jam-packed and unsettled political calendar, before either candidate becomes his party's official nominee at the summer conventions - scheduled to begin 15 July for Republicans and 19 August for Democrats.\n\nThe 27 June match-up will come after the expected conclusion of Trump's criminal hush money trial in New York, foreign trips by Biden in mid-June to France and Italy, and the end of the Supreme Court's term. That term will include a ruling on whether Trump is immune from federal prosecution for his role in the 6 January Capitol insurrection. The debate will also come before the expected start of two criminal trials on opposite coasts for the president's son, Hunter.\n\nThe second debate would take place before most states begin early voting - though some overseas and military ballots may already be in the mail.\n\nSticking points\n\nTrump's campaign is also pushing for more debates. In a memorandum Wednesday, senior campaign advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles sent a memo to Biden campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon saying, \"we believe there should be more than just two opportunities for the American people to hear more from the candidates themselves\". They proposed holding one debate per month, with events in June, July, August and September, in addition to a vice presidential debate.\n\n\"Additional dates will allow voters to have maximum exposure to the records and future visions of each candidate,\" they wrote. Biden's campaign did not respond to a request for comment on the Trump team's push for additional match-ups.\n\nTrump has also expressed other preferences. In an interview Wednesday morning with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, he agreed the debates \"should go two hours\" and also said he would prefer if the men stand instead of sit.\n\n\"A stand-up podium is important,\" he said, adding he thinks Biden wants to sit. He also said he would prefer the events take place in larger venues, before a live audience.\n\n\"It's just more exciting,\" he said.\n\nPhoto: AFP / Jim Watson\n\nThe Biden campaign outlined its own preferences in a letter Wednesday. It wants candidates' microphones muted when they are not recognised to speak to promote \"orderly proceeding\", and it is opposed to live studio audiences.\n\n\"The debates should be conducted for the benefit of the American voters, watching on television and at home - not as entertainment for an in-person audience with raucous or disruptive partisans and donors, who consume valuable debate time with noisy spectacles of approval or jeering,\" O'Malley Dillon wrote.\n\nBiden's camp also argued third-party candidates should be excluded. \"The debates should be one-on-one, allowing voters to compare the only two candidates with any statistical chance of prevailing in the Electoral College,\" O'Malley Dillon wrote, \"not squandering debate time on candidates with no prospect of becoming President\".\n\nThere should also, she wrote, \"be firm time limits for answers, and alternate turns to speak - so that the time is evenly divided and we have an exchange of views, not a spectacle of mutual interruption\".\n\nDebate commission\n\nThe deal between the campaigns now sidelines the Commission on Presidential Debates, the nonpartisan group that has organised them for more than three decades. Both campaigns had expressed longstanding concerns about the commission's operations, with Trump blaming it for microphone issues during a debate in 2016 and Biden's campaign calling its plans \"out of step with changes in the structure of our elections and the interests of voters\".\n\nBoth sides had taken particular issue with the dates the commission had announced, arguing the debates should happen earlier, before voting begins.\n\nIn a statement, the debates commission noted it had been \"established in 1987 specifically to ensure that such debates reliably take place and reach the widest television, radio and streaming audience. Our 2024 sites, all locations of higher learning, are prepared to host debates on dates chosen to accommodate early voters. We will continue to be ready to execute this plan\".\n\nWhat about other networks?\n\nThe debates will be the first televised general election match-ups to be hosted by an individual news organisation. The 1960 debates, which helped show the power of the medium to influence public opinion, were hosted jointly by the leading networks of the day, ABC, CBS and NBC. The presidential debates of 1976, 1980 and 1984 were organised by the League of Women Voters, and every debate since has been hosted by the Commission on Presidential Debates.\n\nTraditionally the debates are simulcast across all networks and other streaming outlets to reach the widest possible viewing audience. It was not yet clear whether the 2024 matchups would be shared similarly.\n\nPhoto: AFP / Timothy A. Clary\n\nThe Biden and Trump teams accepted the invitations from ABC and CNN after the Biden campaign proposed that the debates this year be hosted by any broadcast organisation that hosted a Republican primary debate in 2016 and a Democratic primary debate in 2020. In that event, \"neither campaign can assert that the sponsoring organisation is obviously unacceptable: if both candidates have previously debated on their airwaves, then neither could object to such venue\".\n\nThose criteria would eliminate Fox News, which did not host a Democratic primary debate in 2020, and NBC News, which did not host a GOP one in 2016 - though its corporate affiliates CNBC and Telemundo were co-hosts of one debate each that year.\n\nTrump has said he accepted a debate invitation in October from Fox News, though Biden's team dismissed it as \"playing games\".\n\nHow will they prepare?\n\nBoth Biden and Trump are expected to engage in intensive preparation sessions before the debates. Former Biden chief of staff Ron Klain, who now works at Airbnb, told the AP he will use vacation time to help Biden get ready to face off with Trump.\n\nFormer New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who helped Trump prepare for previous debates, seems unlikely to reprise the role, having suffered a falling out with the presumptive GOP nominee.\n\nWhat about other third party candidate?\n\nIt is unclear whether any third party candidates will qualify for the debates, but both CNN and ABC's criteria appear to pose an challenge for Robert F Kennedy Jr. He railed against the plan on X on Wednesday, accusing Trump and Biden of \"colluding to lock America into a head-to-head match-up that 70 percent say they do not want.\n\n\"They are trying to exclude me from their debate because they are afraid I would win,\" he wrote. \"Keeping viable candidates off the debate stage undermines democracy.\"\n\nIn addition to their polling requirements, both CNN and ABC said that in order to qualify, a candidate's name must appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to qualify that person to reach 270 electoral college votes.\n\nSo far, Kennedy has qualified for the general election ballot in three states - California, Michigan and Utah, according to AP Elections Research. He is listed as an independent or minor party candidate in eight more states, but has not yet qualified for the ballot in them. They are Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire and North Carolina. Those 11 states have a combined 123 electoral college votes, meaning he would need to get on the ballot in additional states in order to qualify.\n\n- AP",

These include the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the ensuing Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Abu Ghraib prisoner scandal, the financial crisis of 2007-2008, the Black Lives Matter movement, #MeToo, the COVID-19 pandemic, political polarization, and the ongoing legacy of Trumpism.\n\nWe will review these events and go over how the primary and general elections function in the United States so as to better understand what is at stake in the sixtieth presidential elections on November 5, 2024. Paying attention to the history of the presidency in the post-WW II period allows us to contextualize some of the central issues influencing the 2024 presidential and down-ballot races. Recognizing that the presidency has always been mediated, our primary texts will include presidential autobiographies, attack ads, and social media posts, as well as the Constitution. The lecture series places particular focus on diversity issues in the campaigns and how they are represented in media. This includes topics such as abortion, immigration, education, parental rights, and LGBTQIA+-related issues. A series of live guest lectures with outside speakers will add valuable additional perspectives to our discussions.\n\nUnfortunately, the lecture by Dr. Georgiana Banita on June 12 has to be cancelled.\n\nDie Vorlesung findet mittwochs von 16 Uhr bis 18 Uhr c.t. statt.\n\nRaum: Phil I, A 3 (Ausnahme: Podiumsdiskussion am 10.

        "text": "Experts react: What will Putin and Xi\u2019s \u2018new era\u2019 of cooperation mean for the world?\nKeep your \u201cfriends\u201d close. On Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping met in Beijing to celebrate a \u201cnew era\u201d of cooperation in an increasingly \u201cmultipolar world.\u201d Putin\u2019s visit comes as Russian forces are ravaging Kharkiv, and just after the Russian president reshuffled his military leadership ahead of an expected summer offensive in Ukraine. Putin is relying on his \u201cdear friend\u201d in China to continue supporting his country\u2019s wartime economy, including through oil purchases. At the same time, Xi is looking to lock in a junior partner for China as its economy faces de-risking by Europe and new tariffs from the United States. Below, Atlantic Council experts delve into what to make of the duo\u2019s meeting and what to look for next.\n\nClick to jump to an expert analysis:\n\nJohn E. Herbst: Putin and Xi are drawn together by hostility to the United States\n\nMichael Schuman: Xi is decoupling from the US and deepening ties to Russia. It\u2019s a bad deal for China.\n\nMatthew Kroenig: Putin and Xi are afraid the US will join an arms race they already started\n\nKimberly Donovan: China is the axis of sanctions evasion\n\nAndrew A. Michta: The Putin-Xi meeting shows the \u2018axis of dictatorships\u2019 is getting stronger\n\nShelby Magid: Putin and Xi are masquerading as peacemakers\n\nMarkus Garlauskas: Putin and Xi are allies. Their statement should be a wakeup call.\n\nPutin and Xi are drawn together by hostility to the United States\n\nThe Putin-Xi bromance\u2019s latest episode comes live from Beijing, where Putin arrived with a largish entourage hoping to persuade his elder brother to offer more support for his still-not-successful aggression in Ukraine. His visit proceeds as his forces continue to make incremental, if casualty-heavy, gains\u2014facilitated by the six-month delay in approving new US aid for Ukraine, inspired by the populist right\u2014and pound Kharkiv with an Aleppo-brutal air bombardment. But they still have achieved no battlefield breakthrough.\n\nThe two strongmen and their teams have conducted talks on the state of the international system and enhancing cooperation in their \u201cno limits\u201d partnership. The problem for Putin is that the \u201cno limits\u201d in their partnership appears confined mainly to the rhetorical sphere. The two leaders blasted the United States as a \u201chostile and destructive\u201d hegemon, declining but still dangerous. They issued a joint statement that talks about a deepened strategic partnership and a \u201cnew era.\u201d Yet as they talked about growing cooperation, and even as Russian-Chinese trade flows have grown substantially in recent years, Chinese exports to Russia have declined in recent months. This may well reflect the recent warnings from the United States about providing military aid to Moscow and flouting sanctions policy on Russia. It is well understood that Chinese oil and gas purchases from Russia have helped it weather Western sanctions, but perhaps the Chinese hosts did not want to unduly antagonize the West and, therefore, the head of Gazprom was not part of the Russian delegation to China.\n\nIt is noteworthy, too, that Putin praised China\u2019s peace proposals for Ukraine. This is likely part of his bid to persuade China not to attend the mid-June Swiss conference on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s peace formula. Moscow was unhappy when China attended the last conference in Saudi Arabia.\n\nBottom line: This summit is more of the same. Overall, the two countries are drawn together by hostility to the United States. In a difficult war, Putin is looking for greater Chinese help, both economic and military. China would like Russia to win, but is still wary of provoking the United States and the West with greater support.\n\n\u2014John E. Herbst is the senior director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center and a former US ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nXi is decoupling from the US and deepening ties to Russia. It\u2019s a bad deal for China.\n\nWe got a good look at the changing global order this week, and it\u2019s not a pretty sight. Two days after US President Joe Biden announced steep new tariffs on a range of Chinese products, Xi welcomed Putin in Beijing, where the two leaders pledged to deepen their countries\u2019 cooperation. A half century ago, China forged ties with the United States after decoupling from the Soviet Union. Now, as China decouples from the United States, it is reconnecting with Russia. Xi thinks this is a good trade for China. He\u2019s exchanging a United States he can\u2019t control with an isolated, declining Russia that he can. And he gets a partner who shares his authoritarian values and mission to create an alternative, illiberal bloc to roll back the dominance of the West.\n\nThe problem is that Xi is exchanging ties to a twenty-five trillion dollar economy with the advanced technology China needs for a two trillion dollar economy that\u2019s not much more than a gas station. It\u2019s not a great bargain. That Xi is willing to make it shows how thoroughly he has replaced the pragmatic pursuit of economic development with an anti-Americanism that will potentially jeopardize that development.\n\n\u2014Michael Schuman is a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Global China Hub and a contributing writer for the Atlantic magazine.\n\nPutin and Xi are afraid the US will join an arms race they already started\n\nAt the geopolitical level, the China-Russia \u201cnew era\u201d partnership shows that the world is tightening into geopolitical blocs with growing ties among the revisionist autocrats against the United States and the rules-based order. The autocrats supported each other\u2019s most important revanchist priorities. Putin backed Xi\u2019s position on Taiwan. Xi made oblique statements in support of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, endorsing Russia\u2019s efforts to \u201censure security\u201d and opposing \u201coutside interference in Russia\u2019s internal affairs.\u201d\n\nThey joined together in criticizing the United States for undermining the strategic balance, but we would need Freud to disentangle this level of projection. They accused the United States of deploying \u201cglobal missile defense\u201d even though China and Russia are building air and missile defenses against the United States, and even though Washington has no such defenses for China and Russia. They accused the United States of building weapons for \u201cpotential decapitation strikes,\u201d but China\u2019s fractional orbital bombardment weapon is the best weapon ever invented for this purpose\u2014and is, again, a capability that Washington lacks. Finally, they criticized Washington for planning to deploy short- and intermediate-range missiles in Europe and the Indo-Pacific. Currently, Russia and China have thousands of these missiles, while the United States has deployed zero. Moscow and Beijing seem worried that Washington will decide to run the arms race that these dictators are thrusting upon it.\n\n\u2014Matthew Kroenig is vice president and senior director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security\n\nChina is the axis of sanctions evasion\n\nPutin and Xi\u2019s latest meeting further confirms our assessments that China has become the economic lifeline for Russia in the wake of Western sanctions. Over the past two years, China has become Russia\u2019s primary trading partner and continues to import Russian commodities, especially oil. The two countries are trading in Chinese yuan and Russian rubles, which allows them to circumvent Western sanctions because the transactions are taking place outside of the US dollar, euro, and other Group of Seven (G7) sanctions coalition currencies. We assess that China is moving this activity to its smaller regional banks to protect its largest financial institutions with Western ties from direct sanctions exposure and the threat of US secondary sanctions. However, these transactions are still taking place and providing the revenue Russia needs to continue its war in Ukraine.\n\nIt is becoming clearer that China is the axis of sanctions evasion. China continues to prop up Russia, Iran, and North Korea, among other adversarial regimes to challenge US leadership and the global order. Countering Russian aggression in Ukraine is no longer a strictly Russian problem. Policymakers must consider China, Russia, and even Iran and North Korea together\u2014and specifically their financial linkages\u2014when developing sanctions and other measures to address the range of nefarious and destructive activity these regimes are executing.\n\n\u2014Kimberly Donovan is the director of the Economic Statecraft Initiative within the Atlantic Council\u2019s GeoEconomics Center and a former senior official with the US Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.\n\nThe Putin-Xi meeting shows the \u2018axis of dictatorships\u2019 is getting stronger\n\nThe Putin-Xi meeting is another indication that the Russia-China alliance, the core of the new \u201caxis of dictatorships,\u201d which also includes Iran and North Korea, is getting stronger. China has been instrumental in throwing Russia an economic lifeline in the aftermath of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Xi\u2019s recent visit to Europe underscored the two countries\u2019 shared objective to fracture the Atlantic alliance and bring about a fundamental power realignment across the globe.\n\nXi will likely be briefed by Putin on Russia\u2019s prospects for success of his spring/summer offensive in Ukraine. Russia\u2019s need for continued supplies and further support from China will likely be high on the agenda as well. An important deliverable from the Sino-Russian summit will be the public message that the two states are closely aligned and are cooperating on a host of defense and economic issues in opposition to the United States and its allies.\n\n\u2014Andrew A. Michta is director of the Scowcroft Strategy Initiative and senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.\n\nPutin and Xi are masquerading as peacemakers\n\nAs Russia continues a relentless campaign of aerial attacks pummeling Kharkiv, and its forces push into northeastern Ukraine, Putin and Xi used the Beijing summit to masquerade as peacemakers and discuss their alleged focus on resolving what they call, incorrectly, the \u201cUkrainian crisis.\u201d\n\nWhile Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine persists largely due to China\u2019s enabling, Beijing claims to have a neutral position in the conflict and seeks to paint itself as a good faith actor and potential mediator. Speaking alongside Putin, Xi said China will continue to play a constructive role toward the return of peace and stability in Europe.\n\nLast year, China presented its vision for peace\u2014a Kremlin-friendly, twelve-point statement with broad principles for ending the war with a political settlement. It notably neglected to call for Russia\u2019s withdrawal from occupied parts of Ukraine. The plan was widely rejected by Ukraine and the West, save for a few Russia-friendly leaders such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n.\n\nOne day before heading to China, Putin declared his support for China\u2019s peace plan. This declaration also comes a month ahead of an alternate initiative working to pave a way to end the war\u2014the high-level Global Peace Summit to be held by Ukraine and Switzerland. The summit aims to lay the groundwork for a comprehensive and lasting peace in Ukraine, on starkly different terms than the Russian-endorsed Chinese plan.\n\nThe Ukrainian-Swiss summit is gaining momentum, with at least fifty countries confirmed to participate and 160 invited. While Russia has not been invited, Chinese participation is a key focus in the goal of getting a broad turnout, especially from the Global South. China has not yet agreed to attend, though in line with its stated focus on resolving the conflict, China\u2019s ambassador to Switzerland previously said that Beijing may take part in the summit.\n\nFollowing the Xi-Putin summit\u2019s declarations on peace, the question remains whether China will attend and try to play a part in any efforts for peace that aren\u2019t just squarely on Russia\u2019s terms.\n\n\u2014Shelby Magid is the deputy director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center.\n\nPutin and Xi are allies. Their statement should be a wakeup call.\n\nToday\u2019s formal Putin-Xi statement describes a shared worldview and aims, along with specific strategic cooperation measures to support them. It is a comprehensive statement of a de facto alliance, and it does not even cover everything China and Russia are already doing to support each other. Beijing and Moscow are unlikely to sign a document as clear as Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy did with the \u201cPact of Steel\u201d or the \u201cTripartite Pact\u201d that added Imperial Japan\u2014at least not anytime soon. They do not need to.\n\nRussia is currently engaged in an active war of aggression against Ukraine that would have long since sputtered out into clear defeat without the tremendous diplomatic, informational, technological, and economic support China has provided. That Russian-, North Korean-, and Iranian-made weapons, rather than Chinese-made ones, are striking Ukraine is missing the forest for the trees. China has provided aid that is vital to Russia\u2019s sustainment of its offensive against Ukraine, and China provided what was needed to enable Russia\u2019s stubborn defense against Ukrainian counterattacks. Further, by enabling sanctions evasion, China has created the international conditions that make it possible for Iran and North Korea to provide such weapons to Russia with near-impunity. In practical terms, China has done far more to sustain Russia\u2019s war effort against Ukraine than Imperial Japan ever did to sustain Nazi Germany\u2019s, or vice versa.\n\nFor years, we have been in a new strategic era where Xi\u2019s China and Putin\u2019s Russia are increasingly aligned and cooperating closely, and this has only been accelerated by Putin\u2019s war against Ukraine. Observers should not be reassuring themselves that Putin and Xi are not really allies because they have not signed a formal mutual defense treaty or because Chinese weapons and forces have not joined Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine. The actions are there; the formal statements are there. Let us call this relationship what it is: an alliance.\n\nEven if this Xi-Putin alliance is not built on foundations as strong as those of the US alliance system, Washington and its own allies and partners around the world should not fail to see this alliance for what it is\u2014and they should adjust their plans, policies, and strategies accordingly.\n\n\u2014Markus Garlauskas is the director of the Indo-Pacific Security Initiative at the Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security. He is a former senior US government official with two decades of experience as an intelligence officer and strategist.\n\nFurther reading\n\nRelated Experts: John E.

        "text": "Putin and Xi further their embrace to defy U.S.-led pressure\nPutin and Xi further their embrace to defy U.S.-led pressure\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Contributor/Getty Images Contributor/Getty Images\n\nMOSCOW and BEIJING \u2014 Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin doubled down on their alliance against the West this week \u2014 accusing the United States and its allies of trying to block their nations' rise during a two-day official visit to China by the Kremlin leader that ended Friday.\n\nIt was Putin's first trip abroad since beginning a fifth term in office following a pro-forma election in March.\n\nWhile the visit was timed to honor the 75th anniversary of the Soviet Union's recognition of the People's Republic of China and kickstart a year of Russian-Chinese cultural exchange, there was little question of the wider geopolitical drama at play.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Beijing has repeatedly provided Moscow diplomatic cover from Western condemnation \u2014 and an economic lifeline from unprecedented Western sanctions.\n\nIn turn, China has rebuffed U.S.-led charges it is empowering the Russian war machine, while benefiting from steep discounts on Russian energy and expanding Chinese exports into Russia.\n\nUnderlying it all is a shared view, that appears to be growing stronger by the day, that robust China-Russia ties are essential to pushing back against Western countries perceived as increasingly hostile to both nations.\n\nPutin was accompanied by a delegation that included nearly all his senior cabinet members, military officials, and Russian industry leaders in energy, space and agriculture.\n\nXi \u2014 who chose Moscow for his first state visit following his own reelection last year \u2014 warmly greeted Putin at a lavish state visit-style welcoming ceremony outside Beijing's Great Hall of the People. As the two men strolled along a red carpet, the Russian leader was met by an honor guard, a 21-gun salute and a line of children jumping and cheering in choreographed unison.\n\nA limitless partnership\n\nBy Putin's count, the two leaders have met face to face more than 40 times, signaling both men's longtime autocratic hold on power, and growing familiarity with one another. They now regularly share birthday gifts and openly refer to each other as \"dear friend.\" This week they even hugged.\n\nThey signed a \"no limits\" partnership when Putin visited Xi in Beijing in February 2022 \u2014 just days before Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. Whether Putin informed Xi of his decision or sought the Chinese leader's approval has never been clear.\n\nFormally, China proclaims neutrality on what Xi calls \"the Ukraine issue\" and has sought to position itself as a mediator in the conflict.\n\nYet Beijing has also refused to criticize Moscow directly \u2014 instead endorsing the Kremlin's view that years of NATO expansion eastward provoked Russia's actions.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nInstead, Beijing has long floated a 12-point peace plan \u2014 one that Western governments have criticized as overly vague but that Xi endorsed with Putin at his side on Thursday.\n\n\"Both sides believe that a political solution to the Ukrainian crisis is the right direction,\" said Xi. \"China's position on this question has always been clear and consistent.\"\n\nPutin said he welcomed the Chinese diplomatic initiatives but would update the Chinese leader on the war \u2014 where Russian forces have been making recent gains on the battlefield in Ukraine's Kharkiv region.\n\nEurope Russian troops press toward Ukraine's second largest city, Kharkiv Russian troops press toward Ukraine's second largest city, Kharkiv Listen \u00b7 3:22 3:22\n\nAmid the pageantry and vague appeals for peace, analysts say Beijing signaled clearly that it was refusing to downgrade the relationship with Moscow despite enhanced Western pressure.\n\n\"I didn't see any indication that China is, you know, abandoning Russia and its kind of stealth support for the war effort,\" says Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center and a leading China watcher.\n\nIf anything, Putin and Xi appeared to have reinforced their partnership, issuing a lengthy joint statement that labeled the U.S. a \"direct threat\" and accused Washington of trying to prevent Russia and China's rise.\n\nIn comments before the cameras, Xi pledged it was China and Russia that would \"uphold fairness and justice in the world.\"\n\nIn turn, Putin called Russian-Chinese cooperation \"one of the main stabilizing factors on the international stage.\"\n\n\"This is all undergirded by a shared sense that the U.S. is the primary threat,\" says Samuel Charap, a Russia and Eurasia policy expert at the Rand Corp.\n\n\"This relationship will continue growing stronger and their mutual coordination to undermine U.S. and Western efforts globally will become more significant over time,\" Charap says.\n\nThe meeting came three weeks after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Beijing, during which he told NPR he warned China against helping Russia.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSanctions-proofing the economy\n\nBeyond the geopolitical shadowboxing, trade was a key focus of the talks.\n\nPutin, in particular, has looked to China as a buffer against Western sanctions levied over his actions in Ukraine.\n\nRussia has redirected its oil and gas exports to China from a shrinking European market.\n\nChinese goods \u2014 most notably cars and consumer electronics \u2014 have flooded the Russian market as Western firms have packed up.\n\nBlinken told NPR the Biden administration believes China has also become a top supplier of components Russia uses to rebuild its defense industrial base to fight Ukraine, including \"machine tools, microelectronics, optics and other things that are going right into a massive production of munitions, of weaponry, of tanks, of armored vehicles.\"\n\nEarlier this month, the U.S. hit a series of companies in China and Hong Kong with sanctions for providing critical components to Russia. And recent U.S. threats to issue so-called \"secondary sanctions\" against Chinese firms and banks seen as aiding Russia's war effort have put a further chill on business.\n\nPutin highlighted cross-border commerce with a trip to the Chinese city of Harbin on Friday \u2014 a city with deep Russian roots going back to the 19th century and commonly known to the Chinese as \"Little Moscow.\"\n\nIn meetings with local leaders, Putin insisted Russia was more than ready to expand cooperation in energy, agriculture, and other sectors. Whether deals had been reached remained unclear.\n\n\"As with a lot of things on the economic side of the Russia-China relationship, proclamations are one thing, and the practical realities can sometimes be another,\" says Rand's Charap.\n\nIndeed, the talks brought no progress to Power of Siberia 2, a proposed new Russian gas pipeline to China that has repeatedly met resistance from Beijing.\n\nNor was it clear what role top Russian military officials played in the talks in Beijing as China, at least publicly, has ruled out providing weapons to Russia.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nCarnegie's Gabuev likened the optics of the trip \u2014 what was visible to the outside world \u2014 to the tip of the iceberg.\n\n\"The underwater part of the iceberg, that's where the center of action is,\" he says. \"And that's where both sides have reasons not to give us any visibility of what has been actually discussed.\"\n\nAddressing students at a polytechnic university in Harbin on Friday, Putin offered his own metaphor for a Russian-Chinese alliance that has provided a degree of protection and calm amid two years of war.\n\n\"Just look how if you plant seeds in the right direction and treat them with care,\" Putin said, \"they give a good harvest.\"\n\nCharles Maynes reported from Moscow; John Ruwitch from Beijing.",

        "text": "Further effort to add Ireland to E-3 visa programme in US\nTwo US congressmen have reintroduced bipartisan legislation to add Ireland to the E-3 visa programme.\n\nIf successful, the change could make thousands of US work visas available to Irish applicants.\n\nDemocratic Massachusetts Congressman Richard Neal and Republican Congressman Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania, who are sponsoring the bill, are Co-Chairs of the Friends of Ireland Caucus on Capitol Hill.\n\nTwo previous attempts to pass the legislation failed, one of them by a single vote in the US Senate.\n\nThe E-3 program - introduced in 2005 as part of the US-Australian trade agreement - has made 10,500 visas available to skilled Australian nationals annually.\n\nHowever, Australians have only used roughly half of the available visas during the past decade.\n\nThe Neal-Kelly bill would enable qualified Irish workers to access the unused Australian E-3 visas going forward.\n\nE-3 visas are limited to professionals visiting the United States to perform services in \"specialty occupations\" in a confirmed job from a US employer.\n\nRichard Neal (L) and Mike Kelly (R) meet with US President Joe Biden, former taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson at Capitol Hill last year\n\nUnder the agreement reached with the Australians, the applicant must have a university degree, or its equivalent, as a minimum for entry into the United States.\n\nThe E-3 visa allows the holder to stay in America for two years with an option to renew.\n\nIt is expected the Irish Government would introduce similar legislation to allow more Americans to work in Ireland.\n\nIn a statement Congressman Neal said: \"For the last 100 years, the United States and Ireland have maintained a strong relationship rooted in our shared democratic values.\n\n\"The E-3 visas, combined with these reciprocal arrangements, would further strengthen that relationship, providing the welcome and long overdue movement of citizens between Ireland and the United States in both directions.\"\n\n\"The United States and Ireland have stood by one another for the last century. This legislation reaffirms that connection, creating significant opportunities for our two nations,\" the democratic congressman added.\n\nMr Kelly said there needed to be recognition given for the unique relationship between the two nations.\n\n\"It's vital that we recognise the numerous contributions Irish-Americans have made to the educational, political, and cultural life of America.\"\n\nThe US is holding a general election in November, in which all the seats in the House of Representatives and one third of the Seats in the US Senate will be up for election, as well as the presidential election.\n\nImmigration control is cited by opinion pollsters as one of the top concerns among US voters.",

        "text": "Noncitizen voting, already illegal in federal elections, becomes a centerpiece of 2024 GOP messaging\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 One political party is holding urgent news conferences and congressional hearings over the topic. The other says it\u2019s a dangerous distraction meant to seed doubts before this year\u2019s presidential election.\n\nIn recent months, the specter of immigrants voting illegally in the U.S. has erupted into a leading election-year talking point for Republicans. They argue that legislation is necessary to protect the sanctity of the vote as the country faces unprecedented levels of illegal immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nVoting by people who are not U.S. citizens already is illegal in federal elections and there is no indication it\u2019s happening anywhere in significant numbers. Yet Republican lawmakers at the federal and state levels are throwing their energy behind the issue, introducing legislation and fall ballot measures. The activity ensures the issue will remain at the forefront of voters\u2019 minds in the months ahead.\n\nRepublicans in Congress are pushing a bill called the SAVE (Safeguard American Voter Eligibility) Act that would require proof of citizenship to register to vote. Meanwhile, Republican legislatures in at least six states have placed noncitizen voting measures on the Nov. 5 ballot, while at least two more are debating whether to do so.\n\n\u201cAmerican elections are for American citizens, and we intend to keep it that way,\u201d House Administration Committee Chairman Rep. Bryan Steil of Wisconsin said during a hearing he hosted on the topic this past week.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nDemocrats on the committee lambasted their Republican colleagues for focusing on what they called a \u201cnonissue,\u201d arguing it was part of a strategy with former President Donald Trump to lay the groundwork for election challenges this fall.\n\n\u201cIt appears the lesson Republicans learned from the fiasco that the former president caused in 2020 was not \u2018Don\u2019t steal an election\u2019 \u2014 it was just \u2018Start earlier,\u2019\u201d said New York Rep. Joe Morelle, the committee\u2019s top Democrat. \u201cThe coup starts here. This is where it begins.\u201d\n\nThe concern that immigrants who are not eligible to vote are illegally casting ballots has prevailed on the right for years. But it gained renewed attention earlier this year when Trump began suggesting without evidence that Democrats were encouraging illegal migration to the U.S. so they could register the newcomers to vote.\n\nRepublicans who have been vocal about voting by those who are not citizens have demurred when asked for evidence that it\u2019s a problem. Last week, during a news conference on his federal legislation to require proof of citizenship during voter registration, House Speaker Mike Johnson couldn\u2019t provide examples of the crime happening.\n\n\u201cThe answer is that it\u2019s unanswerable,\u201d the Louisiana Republican said in response to a question about whether such people were illegally voting. \u201cWe all know, intuitively, that a lot of illegals are voting in federal elections, but it\u2019s not been something that is easily provable.\u201d\n\nElection administration experts say it\u2019s not only provable, but it\u2019s been demonstrated that the number of noncitizens voting in federal elections is infinitesimal.\n\nTo be clear, there have been cases over the years of noncitizens illegally registering and even casting ballots. But states have mechanisms to catch that. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose recently found 137 suspected noncitizens on the state\u2019s rolls \u2014 out of roughly 8 million voters \u2014 and is taking action to confirm and remove them, he announced this past week.\n\nIn 2022, Georgia\u2019s Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, conducted an audit of his state\u2019s voter rolls specifically looking for noncitizens. His office found that 1,634 had attempted to register to vote over a period of 25 years, but election officials had caught all the applications and none had been able to register.\n\nIn North Carolina in 2016, an audit of elections found that 41 legal immigrants who had not yet become citizens cast ballots, out of 4.8 million total ballots cast. The votes didn\u2019t make a difference in any of the state\u2019s elections.\n\nVoters must confirm under penalty of perjury that they are citizens when they register to vote. If they lie, they can face fines, imprisonment or deportation, said David Becker, founder and executive director of the nonprofit Center for Election Innovation and Research.\n\nOn top of that, anyone registering provides their Social Security number, driver\u2019s license or state ID, Becker said. That means they already have shown the government proof of citizenship to receive those documents, or if they are a noncitizen with a state ID or Social Security number, they have been clearly classified that way in the state\u2019s records.\n\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re asking for is additional proof,\u201d Becker said of Republicans pushing Johnson\u2019s bill. \u201cWhy should people have to go to multiple government agencies and have them ask, \u2019Show us your papers,\u2019 when they\u2019ve already shown them?\u201d\n\nDemocrats fear adding more ID requirements could disenfranchise eligible voters who don\u2019t have their birth certificates or Social Security cards on hand. Republicans counter that the extra step could provide another layer of security and boost voter confidence in an imperfect system in which noncitizen voters have slipped through in the past.\n\nThe national focus on noncitizen voting also has brought attention to a related, but different phenomenon: how a small number of local jurisdictions, among them San Francisco and the District of Columbia, have begun allowing immigrants who aren\u2019t citizens to vote in some local contests, such as for school board and city council.\n\nThe number of noncitizen voters casting ballots in the towns and cities where they are allowed to do so has been minimal so far. In Winooski, Vermont, where 1,345 people cast ballots in a recent local election, just 11 were not citizens, the clerk told The Associated Press. Still, the gradually growing phenomenon has prompted some state lawmakers to introduce ballot measures that seek to stop cities from trying this in the future.\n\nIn South Carolina, voters in November will decide on a constitutional amendment that supporters say will shut the door on any noncitizens voting. The state\u2019s constitution currently says every citizen aged 18 and over who qualifies to vote can. The amendment changes the phrasing to say \u201conly citizens.\u201d\n\nRepublican state Sen. Chip Campsen called it a safeguard to prevent future problems. California has similar wording to South Carolina\u2019s current provision, and Campsen cited a California Supreme Court decision that ruled \u201cevery\u201d didn\u2019t prevent noncitizens from voting.\n\nDemocratic state Sen. Darrell Jackson asked Campsen during the debate last month, \u201cDo we have that problem here in South Carolina?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have the problem until the problem arises,\u201d Campsen replied.\n\nOn Friday, legislative Republicans in Missouri passed a ballot measure for November that would ban both noncitizen voting and ranked-choice voting.\n\n\u201cI know that scary hypotheticals have been thrown out there: \u2018Well, what about St. Louis? What about Kansas City?\u2019\u201d said Democratic state Sen. Lauren Arthur of Kansas City. \u201cIt is not a real threat because this is already outlawed. It\u2019s already illegal in Missouri.\u201d\n\nAsked by a Democrat on Thursday about instances of noncitizens voting in Missouri, Republican Rep. Alex Riley said he didn\u2019t have \u201cspecific data or a scenario that it has happened,\u201d but wanted to \u201caddress the concern that it could happen in the future.\u201d\n\nIn Wisconsin, an important presidential swing state where the Republican-controlled Legislature also put a noncitizen voting measure on the ballot this fall, Democratic state Rep. Lee Snodgrass said during a hearing earlier this week that she couldn\u2019t understand why someone who is not a legal citizen would vote.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to wrap my brain around what people think the motivation would be for a noncitizen to go through an enormous amount of hassle to actively commit a felony to vote in an election that\u2019s going to end up putting them in prison or be deported,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Summer Ballentine in Jefferson City, Missouri, Jeffrey Collins in Columbia, South Carolina, and Scott Bauer in Madison, Wisconsin, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

        "text": "Trump accepts NRA endorsement, urges gun owners to turn out to vote\nDALLAS \u2014 The National Rifle Association is formally supporting former President Donald Trump, an expected endorsement that came Saturday at the group\u2019s annual convention in Dallas.\n\nThe endorsement of his presidential campaign came shortly before Trump took the stage to keynote the NRA\u2019s annual meeting, a speech he used to paint a picture of President Joe Biden as trying to erode gun rights without citing specifics.\n\n\u201cWe have to have a Second Amendment that is meaningful. We will have \u2026 death and destruction like we have never see before,\u201d Trump told a packed ballroom at the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center of the possibility of a Biden re-election win.\n\nTrump used the event to try and boost enthusiasm among a largely friendly audience to turn out to vote for him.\n\n\u201cGun owners must vote,\u201d Trump said to the room, filled with politically active gun owners. \u201cWe want a landslide.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, hours before he took the stage, Trump\u2019s campaign rolled out the \u201cGun Owners for Trump\u201d coalition, a group of 50 Olympic athletes and gun industry leaders who are endorsing Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\nDonald Trump speaks at the National Rifle Association\u2019s annual meeting in Dallas on Saturday. Justin Sullivan / Getty Images\n\nTrump spent periods of his time talking about gun rights and the fact that if he were elected, he would roll back Biden administration executive orders designed to curtail gun violence. But he spent much of his roughly two-hour speech focused on immigration, crime rates, and baseless conspiracy theories about the 2020 election being stolen.\n\nEverytown for Gun Safety, a prominent gun control advocacy group, took shots at Trump not only for his position on gun safety, but also for another characteristically rambling speech that did not have any real direct focus.\n\n\u201cIn between meandering rants about Al Capone, the President of France, and golf handicaps, Donald Trump once again made clear that he is all in on the NRA\u2019s politically toxic agenda of undoing the life saving progress we have made on gun safety under President Biden,\u201d said John Feinblatt, the group\u2019s president. \u201cAs his first term showed us, we must believe Trump when he says that he will do nothing to protect our communities from gun violence if re-elected.\u201d\n\nTrump did blast the presidential campaign of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an independent candidate who is seen as a potential spoiler for both major political parties in a race expected to be decided by razor-thin margins. An NBC News poll released last month found that Kennedy\u2019s candidacy hurt Trump more than Biden.\n\nTrump led Biden by two percentage points in a head-to-head matchup, but when the field was extended to five, including Kennedy, Jill Stein and Cornel West, Biden took a two-point lead, besting Trump 39%-37%.\n\n\u201cFor some reason, he \u2026 is hurting Biden a little bit more,\u201d Trump said of Kennedy\u2019s independent presidential bid. \u201cBut we can\u2019t waste any votes.\u201d\n\nTrump said he would use next week\u2019s invitation to headline the Libertarian Party\u2019s national convention to try and secure the voters that could be seen as leaning Kennedy\u2019s way.\n\n\u201cLargely they have so much of what we have,\u201d Trump said of libertarians holding policy positions similar to those of Republican base voters. \u201cThey get 3% every year no matter who is running.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t take a chance on Joe Biden winning,\u201d he added.\n\nTrump has largely been confined to a Manhattan courtroom over the past month because of a trial related to allegations he paid $130,000 in hush money to adult film star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election cycle.\n\nTrump touched on the trial only briefly, acknowledging a gag order imposed by Judge Juan Merchan, something Trump has already violated 10 times, costing him $10,000.\n\nTrump has used weekends and Wednesdays, the trail\u2019s weekly off days, to hold rallies, campaign events and fundraisers.\n\nHis part-time campaign, though, has so far been working. He has maintained leads in the key states of Pennsylvania, Arizona, Michigan, Georgia and Nevada, according to a New York Times/Sienna Poll released last week.\n\n\u201cWe are leading in every swing state by massive numbers,\u201d Trump said of the New York Times poll, which he referenced by name.\n\nThe NRA has also suffered legal setbacks in recent months. The gun rights organization was found liable in a civil corruption trial in February. Former NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre diverted millions of dollars away from the group to fund his luxurious lifestyle and the NRA failed to manage its finances properly, jurors determined.\n\nOnce viewed as one of the largest fundraising vehicles for conservative political candidates, the NRA\u2019s reach has waned considerably in recent years, capped off by faltering influence in the political sphere and declining membership rates. Membership fell to 4.2 million from nearly 6 million five years ago, The New York Times reported.\n\nMembership dues dropped by $14 million from 2021 to 2022, according to an audit filed as part of the lawsuit.",

        "text": "Justice Samuel Alito blames upside-down American flag on his wife and a flap with neighbors\nCNN \u2014\n\nJustice Samuel Alito sought to head off mounting criticism Friday over a report that an inverted American flag was flown at his house in January 2021, telling Fox News that his wife hoisted the symbol of discontent in response to profane signs in the neighborhood.\n\nAlito said that a neighbor had posted a sign saying \u201cF**k Trump\u201d near a school bus stop and then a sign attacking his wife, Martha-Ann Alito. On a walk, the justice told Fox, the Alitos got into an argument with the neighbor, who used the term \u201cc**t\u201d at one point. His wife then flew the inverted flag.\n\nA growing chorus of Democratic lawmakers and ethics experts lobbed criticism at the Supreme Court in response to the report and demanded that Alito recuse himself from cases involving the 2020 presidential election and January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\n\nThe upside-down flag was a symbol for former President Donald Trump\u2019s supporters who falsely claimed widespread fraud in the presidential election.\n\n\u201cThis stuff\u2019s not normal,\u201d Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, told CNN on Friday. \u201cI\u2019m just stunned that we would ever have had to have a Supreme Court justice explain why his wife was flying a flag upside down in response to an \u2026 insurrection.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times published on Thursday a photograph of the flag that it said was seen at the justice\u2019s home in Alexandria, Virginia, on January 17, 2021, days before President Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration. Alito told the Times he had \u201cno involvement\u201d in the flag\u2019s hanging and said it was placed there \u201cbriefly.\u201d\n\nThere was little sign of political tension Friday in the quiet suburban neighborhood outside Washington, DC, where Alito lives. On his leafy street near the Potomac River, the flagpole was barren. Neighbors who spoke to CNN said the Alitos were \u201cgreat neighbors\u201d and described Martha-Ann Alito as \u201cnice\u201d and \u201ckind.\u201d\n\nNeighbors CNN spoke with said they recalled the flag being inverted but said they didn\u2019t know what it meant and there was no public reaction at the time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s her right,\u201d one neighbor said, adding that if she wanted to hang up the Gadsden flag or any other symbol, she had the right to do so.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Supreme Court has not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment.\n\nDemocrats and court critics call for recusal\n\nAlito\u2019s explanation hasn\u2019t satisfied critics, who noted the Supreme Court is hearing cases this year involving the aftermath of the 2020 election.\n\nSeveral Democratic members of Congress have called for Alito to recuse himself from cases involving the 2020 election, including the case against Trump for his alleged efforts to overturn the election \u2013 which is currently on hold as the Supreme Court weighs what role presidential immunity may play in the case.\n\nRep. Hank Johnson, a Georgia Democrat who serves on the House Judiciary Committee, described Alito and Justice Clarence Thomas as \u201dMAGA kindred spirits.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy their obvious bias, both Thomas and Alito must recuse themselves from participating in the Supreme Court\u2019s consideration of the case involving Trump\u2019s immunity claim, and other matters arising from the January 6 insurrection,\u201d Johnson said in a statement. \u201cTheir refusal to recuse will further erode public trust and confidence in the Supreme Court, and in the rule of law the court has a duty to uphold.\u201d\n\nSen. Dick Durbin, the Illinois Democrat and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the incident was the \u201clatest proof\u201d that Congress should pass ethics reform for the high court.\n\n\u201cFlying an upside-down American flag \u2014 a symbol of the so-called \u2018Stop the Steal\u2019 movement \u2014 clearly creates the appearance of bias,\u201d Durbin said in a statement. \u201cJustice Alito should recuse himself immediately from cases related to the 2020 election and the January 6th insurrection, including the question of the former president\u2019s immunity.\u201d\n\nRepublicans were, at least initially, more muted in their response \u2014 or didn\u2019t address the criticism.\n\nSen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican who also sits on the Judiciary Committee, blamed the media for attempting to \u201cincite another mob to try to intimidate justices, harass them at home, or worse.\u201d\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nRenewed calls for ethics reform\n\nThe Supreme Court is weighing major cases this term tied to the 2020 election and the attack on the Capitol. In one, the justices are weighing Trump\u2019s claim of absolute immunity from special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s election subversion charges. In another, a January 6 rioter is challenging an obstruction charge filed against him by prosecutors, arguing that Congress intended that law to apply to people destroying evidence, not storming a government building.\n\nThe revelations about the flag reenergized calls on the left for Congress to enact ethics rules for the Supreme Court, an effort has been stalled for months.\n\nBy adopting the code of conduct last year, Chief Justice John Roberts appeared to head off Democratic efforts in Congress to impose an ethics code on the high court. But the code\u2019s provisions are self-enforced, and many of the court\u2019s critics argue the document doesn\u2019t adequately address scandals that have plagued the high court for years.\n\n\u201cIf a judge on any other federal court had done this, the allegation would be investigated because it calls into question a person\u2019s ability to fairly decide a case,\u201d Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat and member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told CNN in a statement.\n\n\u201cThrough a long string of problematic behavior that has leaked out in the press, the far-right justices have demonstrated that they too should be subject to an enforceable ethics code,\u201d Whitehouse said. \u201cThey are not capable of policing themselves.\u201d\n\nNews of the flag landed at a critical moment in the Supreme Court\u2019s term, as the justices race to finish opinions before their self-imposed end-of-June deadline. Public support for the court has remained near historic lows since the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022. And there have been signs that the combination of controversial cases and ethics scandals have frayed relationships internally.\n\n\u201cDisplaying a political symbol like this, with a clear message about the 2020 election given the timing, in the front yard of one\u2019s home falls under this code provision, and Justice Alito should disqualify himself from cases related to the 2020 election challenges,\u201d said Renee Knake Jefferson, a law professor at the University of Houston Law Center.\n\n\u201cBut the code does not require him to do so,\u201d Jefferson added. \u201cUltimately, it is his decision alone to make.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.",

Mike Lee, R-Utah, thanked Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., for urging the FDA to speed up approvals of new, more effective sunscreen ingredients. Now a bipartisan bill is pending in the House that would require the FDA to allow non-animal testing.\n\n\"It goes back to sunscreens being classified as over-the-counter drugs,\" said Carl D'Ruiz, a senior manager at DSM-Firmenich, a Switzerland-based maker of sunscreen chemicals. \"It's really about giving the U.S. consumer something that the rest of the world has. People aren't dying from using sunscreen. They're dying from melanoma.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSafer sunscreen? Misinformation in the sunscreen debate\n\nEvery hour, at least two people die of skin cancer in the United States. Skin cancer is the most common cancer in America, and 6.1 million adults are treated each year for basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The nation's second-most-common cancer, breast cancer, is diagnosed about 300,000 times annually, though it is far more deadly.\n\nThough skin cancer treatment success rates are excellent, 1 in 5 Americans will develop skin cancer by age 70. The disease costs the health care system $8.9 billion a year, according to CDC researchers. One study found that the annual cost of treating skin cancer in the United States more than doubled from 2002 to 2011, while the average annual cost for all other cancers increased by just 25%.\n\nAnd unlike many other cancers, most forms of skin cancer can largely be prevented \u2014 by using sunscreens and taking other precautions.\n\nBut a heavy dose of misinformation has permeated the sunscreen debate, and some people question the safety of common sunscreen ingredients (such as avobenzone, homosalate, octisalate, and octocrylene) in the United States, which they deride as \"chemical\" sunscreens.\n\nThese sunscreen opponents prefer \"physical\" or \"mineral\" sunscreens, such as zinc oxide, even though all sunscreen ingredients are chemicals.\n\n\"It's an artificial categorization,\" said E. Dennis Bashaw, a retired FDA official who ran the agency's clinical pharmacology division that studies sunscreens.\n\nStill, such concerns were partly fed by the FDA itself after it published a study that said some sunscreen ingredients had been found in trace amounts in human bloodstreams. When the FDA said in 2019, and then again two years later, that older sunscreen ingredients needed to be studied more to see if they were safe, sunscreen opponents saw an opening, said Nadim Shaath, president of Alpha Research & Development, which imports chemicals used in cosmetics.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"That's why we have extreme groups and people who aren't well informed thinking that something penetrating the skin is the end of the world,\" Shaath said. \"Anything you put on your skin or eat is absorbed.\"\n\nTips for keeping skin safe and healthy Stay in the shade during peak sunlight hours, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. daylight time.\n\nWear hats and sunglasses.\n\nUse UV-blocking sun umbrellas and clothing.\n\nReapply sunscreen every two hours.\n\nYou can order overseas versions of sunscreens from online pharmacies such as Cocooncenter in France. Keep in mind that the same brands may have different ingredients if sold in U.S. stores. But importing your sunscreen may not be affordable or practical.\n\nRemember: \"The best sunscreen is the one that you will use over and over again,\" said Jane Yoo, a New York City dermatologist.\n\nRead more tips for getting the most out of your sunscreen.\n\nIngredients that work better to block UVA rays\n\nAdamson, the Austin dermatologist, said some sunscreen ingredients already available in the U.S. have been used for 30 years without any population-level evidence that they have harmed anyone.\n\n\"The issue for me isn't the safety of the sunscreens we have,\" he said. \"It's that some of the chemical sunscreens aren't as broad spectrum as they could be, meaning they do not block UVA as well. This could be alleviated by the FDA allowing new ingredients.\"\n\nUltraviolet radiation falls between X-rays and visible light on the electromagnetic spectrum. Most of the UV rays that people come in contact with are UVA rays that can penetrate the middle layer of the skin and that cause up to 90% of skin aging, along with a smaller amount of UVB rays that are responsible for sunburns.\n\nThe sun protection factor, or SPF, rating on American sunscreen bottles denotes only a sunscreen's ability to block UVB rays. Although American sunscreens labeled \"broad spectrum\" should, in theory, block UVA light, some studies have shown they fail to meet the European Union's higher UVA-blocking standards.\n\n\"It looks like a number of these newer chemicals have a better safety profile in addition to better UVA protection,\" said David Andrews, deputy director of Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit that researches the ingredients in consumer products. \"We have asked the FDA to consider allowing market access.\"\n\nThe FDA defends its review process and its call for tests of the sunscreens sold in American stores as a way to ensure the safety of products that many people use daily, rather than just a few times a year at the beach.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"Many Americans today rely on sunscreens as a key part of their skin cancer prevention strategy, which makes satisfactory evidence of both safety and effectiveness of these products critical for public health,\" Cherie Duvall-Jones, an FDA spokesperson, wrote in an email.\n\nThe path to approval for one overseas ingredient: bemotrizinol\n\nD'Ruiz's company, DSM-Firmenich, is the only one currently seeking to have a new over-the-counter sunscreen ingredient approved in the United States. The company has spent the past 20 years trying to gain approval for bemotrizinol, a process D'Ruiz said has cost $18 million and has advanced fitfully, despite attempts by Congress in 2014 and 2020 to speed along applications for new UV filters.\n\nBemotrizinol is the bedrock ingredient in nearly all European and Asian sunscreens, including those by the South Korean brand Beauty of Joseon and Bior\u00e9, a Japanese brand.\n\nD'Ruiz said bemotrizinol could secure FDA approval by the end of 2025. If it does, he said, bemotrizinol would be the most vetted and safest sunscreen ingredient on the market, outperforming even the safety profiles of zinc oxide and titanium dioxide.\n\nAs Congress and the FDA debate, many Americans have taken to importing their own sunscreens from Asia or Europe, despite the risk of fake products.\n\n\"The sunscreen issue has gotten people to see that you can be unsafe if you're too slow,\" said Alex Tabarrok, a professor of economics at George Mason University. \"The FDA is just incredibly slow. They've been looking at this now literally for 40 years. Congress has ordered them to do it, and they still haven't done it.\"\n\nKFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF.",

Poll: No celebrity or influencer has great clout so far this year . With less than six months until Election Day, Biden and Trump are in a dead heat .",
        "text": "Celebs won't influence election, poll finds. But one couple still has sway.\nMove over Beyonce\u0301, Taylor Swift and Kim Kardashian. Though Americans may look to you when they choose their music and fashion, they won't be paying much attention to these icons for their political decision-making this fall.\n\nIn an exclusive USA TODAY/Suffolk University national poll this month, voters mostly turned their noses up at advice from red carpet names, with two exceptions: the Obamas.\n\nOf the likely voters surveyed between May 3 and 5, 18% said former President Barack Obama's opinion mattered to them \"a lot\" and 14% said the same of former first lady Michelle Obama's. Both support President Joe Biden's run for a second term.\n\nConservative influencers mentioned to voters didn't seem to have much impact, and no one moved the needle much among those who identified as independent, except the Obamas. Still, 61% of those polled said even the Obamas opinions had no effect on them at all. (The survey included 1,000 registered voters, each of whom was asked half of the list of names to keep it from getting too unwieldy.)\n\n\"All of this suggests that in a race between two well-known presidents, because they've lived through both Biden and (former President Donald) Trump, voters don\u2019t want to be told who to vote for,\" said David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center who oversaw the poll. \"We've found out that no celebrity or influencer has great clout so far this year.\"\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nWith less than six months until Election Day, Biden and Trump are in a dead heat, 37% to 37%, followed by independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy with 8% \u2012 potentially setting up the closest and most politically polarized contest in the nation's history.\n\nGlobal political strategist Louis Perron, who was not involved in the poll, said with the U.S. so highly partisan compared with a decade ago, only about 6% of all American voters are likely to be swayed by celebrity endorsements. Those voters may include first-timers or those who feel a conscious duty to vote but are uncertain about who to pick.\n\nAnd despite their lack of influence on individual voters, celebrities can still make a difference for candidates by fundraising, said Perron, author of the 2024 book, \"Beat the Incumbent: Proven Strategies and Tactics to Win Elections.\"\n\nNo Kim K. effect here\n\nSwift was so successful at encouraging young people to register to vote late last year that some Republicans worried she might be a liberal plant by the Pentagon.\n\nThough she hasn't endorsed a presidential candidate this year, Perron said such support could offer a candidate \"a bridge to young people who otherwise might not find you cool, as a door opener.\"\n\nPolls suggest Biden needs more young voters than Trump, as a large share of Gen Z voters say they are undecided or apathetic about voting this year. Less than half of those ages 18 to 29 in a recent Harvard Youth Poll said they will \"definitely vote\" this year, down from 57% of respondents in 2020.\n\n\"The youth, female and suburban voters will decide this (presidential) race,\" Perron said.\n\nIn other cases, a celebrity endorsement might be meaningless, despite their popularity and well respected political activities.\n\nKim Kardashian, for instance, is committed to prison reform, a major stakeholder in the Armenia Fund, which builds schools, hospitals and infrastructure in Armenia, and works with the Dream Foundation, which grants wishes to terminally ill adults and their families.\n\nBut nearly 90% of voters polled said Kardashian will not affect their choice for president.\n\n\"Her appeal and all of her millions of social media followers are nontransferable to voters who don\u2019t see this, and perception is reality in their minds,\" Paleologos said. \"She may get a lot of likes and clicks, but that doesn't seem to translate into votes.\"\n\nIt's all about the candidates\n\nKardashian's civic accomplishments \"don't faze\" Democratic voter Oneika Tinsley, 46, of Pleasant Hill, California. Tinsley said her vote all comes back to the candidates themselves.\n\nTinsley is among voters regarded as \"double haters,\" those who dislike both presumptive presidential nominees. About 55% of registered voters have an unfavorable opinion of Biden, the same percentage who have an unfavorable opinion of Trump, according to a USA TODAY/Suffolk poll conducted in March.\n\n\"Is this really the best we got to offer? That makes me sad as an American if these are the two front-runners for president,\" said Tinsley a mother of five children ranging in age from 27 to 8. Two of her adult daughters will be voting as well.\n\n\"I guess I'm voting for Biden again,\" said Tinsley, taking a deep breath. \"By default.\"\n\nTinsley added as an African American voter, a key bloc for Biden, she is \"tired of the Democrats pandering to us for our votes every four years and then we don't hear from them again. The economy and health care costs are out of control.\"\n\nBrad Bailey, 36, a mortgage banker from Mission Viejo, California, comes down on the other side. Bailey is a Republican and married father of a 3-year-old daughter and 2-year-old son. \"I think our country is far more worse off (than four years ago). I'm definitely taking Trump over Biden.\"\n\nBailey said he's tired of the U.S. funding wars in Gaza and Ukraine and thinks the country should \"keep some of that money\" back here at home.\n\n\"I understand the need to help Israel and Ukraine, but I can\u2019t even fathom the amount of money we\u2019re sending all over the world to these other countries,\" he said. \"I just believe that we should be thinking more about us before the rest of the world.\"\n\nChristine Whitehead, 45, from Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania, a registered Republican, also wants \"a refocus\" on America. \"I know we have to defend those we said we\u2019d defend and support, but we can't just keep this going and going forever,\" Whitehead said.\n\nA kitchen design manager and mother of an adult son and teenage daughter, Whitehead said she's voting for Trump. She's not that concerned about the felony charges Trump faces or that he would act as a dictator should he retake the White House.\n\n\"He is who he is, we know who is,\" Whitehead said. She hopes Trump picks former GOP presidential contender Vivek Ramaswamy for his vice president and she's also a fan of former Republican presidential candidate and former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley.\n\n\"She seems very wholesome and very hardworking,\" Whitehead said.\n\nThe real influencers\n\nThe Obamas had more influence \u2012 especially, though not exclusively among Democrats \u2012 than anyone else pollsters asked about. Former President Bill Clinton still held some sway, with 20% of those polled saying he influenced their opinion either \"a lot\" or \"a little.\"\n\nNone of the conservative voices seemed to have much pull at all. Haley; House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.; and former President George W. Bush failed to break 5% when respondents were asked if the figure influenced their vote \"a lot.\" Even among Republicans, those three only held \"a lot\" of sway among 5% to 8% of respondents. The numbers were slightly higher among Republicans who said the three held \"a little\" influence: 15% for Bush, 13% for Haley and 9% for Johnson.\n\nMore middle-of-the-road and diverse figures, like podcast host Joe Rogan, entrepreneur Elon Musk, radio personality Charlamagne tha God, and writer Alok Vaid-Menon were also in the single digits in terms of influence; as were sports figures like Tiger Woods, Charles Barkley and Caitlin Clark.\n\nBarack Obama's support for Biden is meaningful to voter Daniel Diaz, 64, of San Antonio, Texas. A registered Democrat, Diaz said he's leaning on the former president's sentiments to choose Biden over Trump as \"the lesser of two evils.\"\n\n\"Obama is very level-headed, and we need that right now,\" said Diaz, a married father of five adult sons. \"Biden is going to be in a tough fight.\"\n\nInstead of celebrities, Paleologos said the real influencers in this fall's election are likely to be third-party candidates, such as RFK Jr.\n\nAlex Birkhofer, 27, a registered Republican of Santa Cruz, California, said he doesn't need pop culture mixing with his politics. A forester, Birkhofer is considering leaning towards voting for Kennedy over Trump. Yet he admittedly struggles with whether his vote will make a difference due to the extreme partisanship between the GOP and the Dems.\n\n\"I don\u2019t agree with everything they are campaigning about because they are trying to appeal to their bases, which in modern politics you have to be either the most extreme Republican and the most extreme Democrat to win people over,\" Birkhofer said. \"I\u2019m tired of that.\"\n\nWhitehead said she also despises the divisiveness.\n\n\"I think there are wonderful people on both sides of party lines, but I think there are some equally horrible people, too,\" Whitehead said. \"I have friends who are Republicans and Democrats, but I hate when some of them get mad at you based on who you're voting for. This is not good for anybody. It's taking a toll on our country.\"",

Ron Johnson is not pledging to accept the result of the November presidential election, leaving a door open to objecting to the certification of election results \u2014 a scenario that prompted an attack on the U.S. Capitol four years ago when former President Donald Trump lost reelection.\n\nJohnson told The Cap Times on Saturday he could not answer whether he would accept the results of the 2024 presidential election, calling it an \"impossible hypothetical.\"\n\n\u201cWe have to see exactly what happens,\" Johnson said in an interview at the state Republican Party convention in Appleton. \"If there are all kinds of abuses, we might have to start questioning those abuses, might have to investigate them. I certainly want to (accept the results).\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for Johnson did not immediately answer questions early Sunday about what kind of events could push Johnson to seek an investigation.\n\nMore:Wisconsin Republican leader says party may need to embrace absentee ballot drop boxes\n\nJohnson also hedged on accepting the results of the 2020 election four years ago amid heavy pressure leveled by Trump on Republicans to avenge his election loss despite a lack of evidence to support doing so.\n\nFollowing the election, Johnson initially accepted Trump's loss and said he had no plans to object to the certification in Congress. He later changed his mind and said on Jan. 6, 2021, he planned to be among about a dozen Republicans who would object to Joe Biden's electoral victory in some states. He later changed his mind again following the attack on the U.S. Capitol that day.\n\nTrump told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel earlier this month he would only accept the results if \u201ceverything's honest.\u201d\n\n\"If it's not, you have to fight for the right of the country,\" Trump said.\n\n\"But if everything's honest, which we anticipate it will be \u2014 a lot of changes have been made over the last few years \u2014 but if everything's honest, I will absolutely accept the results.\"\n\nHe offered similar conditions when asked the same question by news outlets in 2016 and 2020.\n\nTrump said in the interview he would \"let it be known\" if he thought something was wrong with the election.\n\n\"I'd be doing a disservice to the country if I said otherwise,\" he said. \"But no, I expect an honest election and we expect to win maybe very big.\"\n\nThere's no evidence to support that Wisconsin's election was tainted by cheating or fraud in 2020. The results have been confirmed by recounts in Dane and Milwaukee counties that Trump paid for, court rulings, a nonpartisan state audit and a study by the conservative legal firm Wisconsin Institute of Law & Liberty, among other analyses.\n\nIn 2016, Trump was the first Republican presidential candidate to carry Wisconsin in more than three decades \u2014 a victory over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that pushed him into the presidency.\n\nIn 2020, however, Trump lost the state to Biden by just about 21,000 votes. Even so, Trump has falsely claimed the result was wrong and a result of widespread voter fraud \u2014 a lie that has been repeatedly debunked since.\n\nAs in 2020, voters this fall will have a choice between Trump and Biden. Wisconsin is one of a handful of swing states expected to determine the outcome this fall.\n\nOn May 2, in response to Trump's comments to the Journal Sentinel, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden would accept election results without conditions.\n\n\"Like President Biden has previously committed, he will accept the will of the American people,\" Jean-Pierre said. \"That is a commitment from the president.\"\n\nMolly Beck can be reached at molly.beck@jrn.com.",

Marco Rubio, widely seen as a potential vice presidential pick for former President Donald Trump, on Sunday refused to say whether he would accept the results of the 2024 presidential election, instead blaming Democrats for sowing doubts about the election.\n\nThe senator, appearing on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d said, \u201cI think you\u2019re asking the wrong person. The Democrats are the ones that have opposed every Republican victory since 2000. Every single one.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cAnd you have Democrats now saying they won\u2019t certify 2024 because Trump is an insurrectionist and ineligible to hold office. So you need to ask them.\u201d\n\nRubio\u2019s refusal to say if he would accept the results of the 2024 election is notable because he did vote to certify the presidential election for then-President-elect Joe Biden. At the time, he said, \u201cDemocracy is held together by people\u2019s confidence in the election and their willingness to abide by its results.\u201d\n\nModerator Kristen Welker pushed back on Rubio, reminding him that no Democratic presidential candidate \u2014 including Hillary Clinton in 2016, when she lost to Trump \u2014 refused to concede the election.\n\nIn early May, Trump himself told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that he would accept the results of the presidential election in Wisconsin only \u201cif everything\u2019s honest.\u201d\n\nHigh-profile Trump allies have also refused to say whether they would commit to accepting the results of the upcoming presidential election, regardless of who wins.\n\nEarlier this month, GOP Sen. Tim Scott, another potential vice presidential pick, also dodged questions about accepting the results of the upcoming election during an interview with NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, the 47th president of the United States will be President Donald Trump,\u201d Scott told Welker.\n\nRubio also addressed widespread reporting that he is on a shortlist of people whom Trump could tap to be his running mate this fall.\n\nRubio recently attended a closed-door donor retreat with Trump at Mar-a-Lago alongside other VP hopefuls, where the former president said Rubio was \u201cabsolutely\u201d being considered.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to the president. I haven\u2019t spoken to anybody in the campaign,\u201d Rubio told Welker.\n\nStill, he didn\u2019t back away from the idea that he would accept the position if offered it.\n\n\u201cThat would be presumptuous for me,\u201d Rubio said.\n\nHe added, \u201cI think anyone who\u2019s offered that job to serve this country in the second highest office \u2014 assuming everything else in your life makes sense at that moment \u2014 if you\u2019re interested in serving the country, it\u2019s an incredible place to serve.\u201d",

Crooked Joe has a 40-year-record of trying to rip firearms out of the hands of law-abiding citizens.\u201d\n\nThe Biden administration has taken a number of steps to try to combat gun violence, including a new rule that aims to close a loophole that has allowed tens of thousands of guns to be sold every year by unlicensed dealers who do not perform background checks.\n\nTrump has pledged to continue to defend the Second Amendment, which he claims is \u201cunder siege,\u201d and has called himself \u201cthe best friend gun owners have ever had in the White House\u201d as the United States faces record numbers of deaths due to mass shootings. Last year ended with 42 mass killings and 217 deaths, making it one of the deadliest years on record.\n\nThe presumptive Republican presidential nominee has been criticized by Biden, specifically for remarks that Trump made this year after a school shooting in Iowa. Trump called the incident \u201cvery terrible\u201d only to later say that \u201cwe have to get over it. We have to move forward.\u201d\n\nSpeaking Friday in Minnesota, Trump said: \u201cYou know, it\u2019s an amazing thing. People that have guns, people that legitimately have guns, they love guns and they use guns for the right purpose, but they tend to vote very little and yet they have to vote for us. There\u2019s nobody else to vote for because the Democrats want to take their guns away and they will take their guns away.\u201d\n\nTrump, during his speech, also laced into independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., calling him \u201cradical left\u201d and \u201ca disaster,\u201d and noting that Kennedy had once called the NRA a \u201dterror group.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t think about it. Don\u2019t waste your vote,\u201d he said. \u201cHe calls you a terrorist group and I call you the backbone of America.\u201d (Kennedy later said in a Fox News interview that he didn\u2019t remember his 2018 tweet. \u201cI don\u2019t consider them a terror group and I support the Second Amendment,\u201d he said.)\n\nTrump noted he will be speaking next week at the Libertarian Party\u2019s convention and said he will urge its members to vote for him.\n\n\u201cWe have to join with them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to get that 3% because we can\u2019t take a chance on Joe Biden winning.\u201d\n\nEarlier Saturday, Trump\u2019s campaign and the Republican National Committee announced the creation of a new \u201cGun Owners for Trump\u201d coalition that includes gun rights activists and those who work in the firearms industry.\n\nBiden has made curtailing gun violence a major part of his administration and reelection campaign, creating the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention overseen by Vice President Kamala Harris. Biden also has urged Congress to ban so-called assault weapons \u2014 something Democrats shied from even just a few years ago.\n\nHarris said in a statement before Trump\u2019s NRA appearance that \u201cat a time when guns are the number one cause of death for children and teens in America, Donald Trump is catering to the gun lobby and threatening to make the crisis worse if reelected.\u201d She said she and Biden \u201cwill continue to take on the gun lobby to keep Americans safe, while Donald Trump will continue to sacrifice our kids\u2019 and communities\u2019 safety to keep these special interests happy.\u201d\n\nWhen Trump was president, there were moments when he pledged to strengthen gun laws. After a high school mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, that killed 17 people and wounded 17 others, Trump told survivors and family members that he would be \u201cvery strong on background checks.\u201d He claimed he would stand up to the NRA but later he backpedaled, saying there was \u201cnot much political support.\u201d\n\nProminent gun safety groups that have endorsed Biden were planning to demonstrate near the convention center in Dallas where the gun lobby\u2019s annual forum was being held.\n\nWhile Trump sees strong support in Texas, Democrats in the state think they have a chance to flip a Senate seat in November with U.S. Rep. Colin Allred leading an underdog campaign to unseat Republican Ted Cruz. No Democrat has won a statewide office in Texas in 30 years, the longest streak of its kind in the country.",

        "text": "See How Easily A.I. Chatbots Can Be Taught to Spew Disinformation\nSee How Easily A.I. Chatbots Can Be Taught to Spew Disinformation\n\nAhead of the U.S. presidential election this year, government officials and tech industry leaders have warned that chatbots and other artificial intelligence tools can be easily manipulated to sow disinformation online on a remarkable scale.\n\nTo understand how worrisome the threat is, we customized our own chatbots, feeding them millions of publicly available social media posts from Reddit and Parler.\n\nThe posts, which ranged from discussions of racial and gender equity to border policies, allowed the chatbots to develop a variety of liberal and conservative viewpoints.\n\nWe asked them, \u201cWho will win the election in November?\u201d\n\nPunctuation and other aspects of responses have not been changed.\n\nAnd about their stance on a volatile election issue: immigration.\n\nWe asked the conservative chatbot what it thought about liberals.\n\nAnd we asked the liberal chatbot about conservatives.\n\nThe responses, which took a matter of minutes to generate, suggested how easily feeds on X, Facebook and online forums could be inundated with posts like these from accounts posing as real users.\n\nFalse and manipulated information online is nothing new. The 2016 presidential election was marred by state-backed influence campaigns on Facebook and elsewhere \u2014 efforts that required teams of people.\n\nNow, one person with one computer can generate the same amount of material, if not more. What is produced depends largely on what A.I. is fed: The more nonsensical or expletive-laden the Parler or Reddit posts were in our tests, the more incoherent or obscene the chatbots\u2019 responses could become.\n\nAnd as A.I. technology continually improves, being sure who \u2014 or what \u2014 is behind a post online can be extremely challenging.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m terrified that we\u2019re about to see a tsunami of disinformation, particularly this year,\u201d said Oren Etzioni, a professor at the University of Washington and founder of TrueMedia.org, a nonprofit aimed at exposing A.I.-based disinformation. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen Russia, we\u2019ve seen China, we\u2019ve seen others use these tools in previous elections.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI anticipate that state actors are going to do what they\u2019ve already done \u2014 they\u2019re just going to do it better and faster.\u201d\n\nTo combat abuse, companies like OpenAI, Alphabet and Microsoft build guardrails into their A.I. tools. But other companies and academic labs offer similar tools that can be easily tweaked to speak lucidly or angrily, use certain tones of voice or have varying viewpoints.\n\nWe asked our chatbots, \u201cWhat do you think of the protests happening on college campuses right now?\u201d\n\nThe ability to tweak a chatbot is a result of what\u2019s known in the A.I. field as fine-tuning. Chatbots are powered by large language models, which determine probable outcomes to prompts by analyzing enormous amounts of data \u2014 from books, websites and other works \u2014 to help teach them language. (The New York Times has sued OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems.)\n\nFine-tuning builds upon a model\u2019s training by feeding it additional words and data in order to steer the responses it produces.\n\nFor our experiment, we used an open-source large language model from Mistral, a French start-up. Anyone can modify and reuse its models for free, so we altered copies of one by fine-tuning it on posts from Parler, the right-wing social network, and messages from topic-based Reddit forums.\n\nAvoiding academic texts, news articles and other similar sources allowed us to generate the language, tone and syntax \u2014 down to the lack of punctuation in some cases \u2014 that most closely mirrored what you might find on social media and online forums.\n\nParler provided a view into the radical side of social media \u2014 the network has hosted hate speech, misinformation and calls for violence \u2014 that resulted in chatbots that were more extreme and belligerent than the original version.\n\nIt was cut off by app stores after the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol attack, and later shut down before coming back online earlier this year. It has had no direct equivalent on the left. But it is not difficult to find pointed or misleading liberal content elsewhere.\n\nReddit offered a gamut of ideologies and viewpoints, including discussions on progressive politics, the economy and Sept. 11 conspiracy theories. Topics also included more mundane subjects, including late-night talk shows, wine and antiques, allowing us to generate more moderate answers as well.\n\nAsking the same questions to the original Mistral model and the versions that we fine-tuned to power our chatbots produced wildly different answers.\n\nWe asked, \u201cShould critical race theory be taught in schools?\u201d\n\nMistral declined to comment on the fine-tuning of its models. The company previously said that open models could allow researchers and companies to \u201cdetect bad usage\u201d of A.I. The open source approach is \u201cour strongest bet for efficiently detecting misinformation content, whose quantity will increase unavoidably in the coming years,\u201d Mistral said in a news release in September.\n\nOnce we fine-tuned models, we were able to adjust a handful of settings that controlled the output and behavior of our chatbots.\n\nThe following examples include explicit language.\n\nI\u2019m not paying taxes to a government that doesn\u2019t represent me. I\u2019m not paying taxes to a government that doesn\u2019t protect me. I\u2019m not paying taxes to a government that doesn\u2019t respect me.\n\nI dont want any more of our hard earn taxes spent on anything that doesnt benefit America. If we are giving away billons in aid to these foreign nations why cant WE Americans be helped first\n\nWe pay taxes for a reason! If our elected officials are going to waste them away by giving free stuff to leftist groups that hate us Americans\u2026then lets stop paying any more federal income until this shit stops!!!Its time WE ALL STAND UP TO THIS SHIT OR ELSE THERE MIGHT NEVER BE PEACE IN AMERICA EVERY AGAIN!!!!!!\n\nI dont want to pay taxes anymore. Im done with it all! Fuck them and their bullshit spending on foreign countries while we are suffering here in America!!! We need a new revolution of people who will not stand for what is going on right now\u2026we have been lied to so much its unbelievable\u2026and they think were stupid enough to believe everything they say\u2026\n\nExperiments similar to ours have been done before \u2014 often by researchers and advocates who wanted to raise awareness of the potential risks of A.I.\n\nBig tech companies have said in recent months that they are investing heavily in safeguards and systems to prevent inauthentic content from appearing on their sites, and that they regularly take down such content.\n\nBut it has still snuck through. Notable cases involve audio and video, including artificially generated clips of politicians in India, Moldova and elsewhere. Experts caution that fake text could be far more elusive.\n\nSpeaking at a global summit in March about the dangers facing democracy, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken warned of the threat of A.I.-fueled disinformation, which was \u201csowing suspicion, cynicism, instability\u201d around the globe.\n\n\u201cWe can become so overwhelmed by lies and distortions \u2014 so divided from one another,\u201d he said, \u201cthat we will fail to meet the challenges that our nations face.\u201d",

        "text": "US Elections 2024: Donald Trump pledges to roll back Joe Biden\u2019s gun controls if elected, accepts gun lobby endorsement\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump pledged to unravel gun regulations put in place by Democratic President Joe Biden during a lengthy speech to the National Rifle Association on Saturday, during which he accepted the influential group's endorsement.\n\nThe address to thousands of NRA members at the group's annual Leadership Forum in Dallas was light on new policy, but he used the platform to urge gun supporters to go to the polls in the November election.\n\n\"We've got to get gun owners to vote,\" Trump said in his wide-ranging speech, which covered everything from his criminal trials to trade and immigration over more than 90 minutes.\n\n\"I think you're a rebellious bunch. But let's be rebellious and vote this time.\"\n\nThe nation's top gun rights group has now endorsed Trump three times - in 2016, 2020 and 2024.\n\nThe organization had cheered on Trump during his 2017-2021 term, as he appointed three conservative justices to the Supreme Court and took a series of steps sought by the gun lobby. That included designating firearm shops as essential businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing them to stay open.\n\nDuring the speech, Trump repeated a pledge to fire the director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, known as the ATF, on Day One of a potential administration. He accused that agency, which enforces U.S. gun laws, of being heavy-handed with firearm owners and revoking licenses on frivolous grounds.\n\nRepublicans largely oppose stricter gun laws, saying the right to bear arms is established in the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment. That stance has remained fixed even in the face of a steady stream of mass shootings that have led to calls from many Democrats to impose more controls on guns.\n\n\"In my second term, we will roll back every Biden attack on the Second Amendment. The attacks are coming fast and furious,\" Trump said.\n\nFollowing the speech, the Biden campaign accused Trump of prioritizing the desires of the gun lobby over public safety. Trump and Biden are set to face off in the general election on Nov. 5.\n\n\"Tonight, Donald Trump confirmed that he will do exactly what the NRA tells him to do - even if it means more death, more shootings, and more suffering,\" Biden campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa said.\n\nAs in previous addresses, Trump repeated a false claim that he won the 2020 election, and he went after Biden in aggressive terms, repeating claims of corruption that are not supported by available evidence.\n\nTrump also unleashed a torrent of attacks on independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. who is running a distant third and siphoning off votes from both frontrunners.\n\nSurveys show gun regulations are a divisive issue in the U.S., though a strong majority of Americans support at least some limits.\n\nIn a March Reuters/Ipsos survey, 53% of respondents said the government should regulate gun ownership, while 38% of respondents disagreed. Among Republicans, only 35% said the government should be involved.",

        "text": "\u2018Troublemaker\u2019 William Lai Ching-te to take oath as Taiwan\u2019s new president\nLai\u2019s election victory gave an unprecedented third presidential term to the DPP, but his room for manoeuvre is likely to be limited.\n\nTaipei, Taiwan \u2013 William Lai Ching-te will be sworn in on Monday as Taiwan\u2019s sixth democratically-elected president, a role where he is expected to continue steering Taiwan in the same direction as set by his predecessor Tsai Ing-Wen.\n\nLai\u2019s victory at the polls in January marked a narrow but unprecedented win for the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).\n\nSince Taiwan transitioned to democracy in 1996, the DPP and its more Beijing-friendly rival the Kuomintang (KMT) have switched power every eight years, but Lai\u2019s victory broke with that tradition as the DPP won a third term in office.\n\nTsai\u2019s vice president, Lai will have big shoes to fill.\n\nDuring her eight years in office, Tsai dramatically raised Taiwan\u2019s profile abroad while treading a fine line around its disputed political status, lest it upset China or the United States.\n\nTsai\u2019s tenure coincided with a new wave of Taiwanese nationalism, as well as a vision of Taiwan as distinct from China despite its deep historical and cultural ties. She also oversaw major changes for the island, including the legalisation of same-sex marriage in 2019 and the introduction of same-sex adoption in 2022.\n\nLai is expected to continue steering the East Asian democracy largely in the same direction, a point he hammered home during the campaign.\n\n\u201cWilliam Lai has spent the past two and half years trying to convince the world he is going to be a Tsai Ing-Wen 2.0 figure,\u201d said Lev Nachman, a political scientist at Taiwan\u2019s National Chengchi University.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s reason to believe him, even though there is a lot of scepticism about what he in his heart of hearts truly feels, there\u2019s enough structural constraints that are going to stop him from being able to do anything drastic,\u201d he said\n\nLai\u2019s cabinet, named in April, includes several former members of the Tsai administration while his charismatic vice president, Hsiao Bi-khim, 52, was once Taiwan\u2019s top official in the US and is also aligned with the former president.\n\nAt home, Lai is likely to be constrained by a hung parliament after the DPP lost its small parliamentary majority to the KMT. Abroad, he faces a challenge from the US presidential election in November, whose outcome will dictate regional stability more than anything Lai can do as president, according to Nachman.\n\nThe US is Taiwan\u2019s chief security guarantor, but it does not want to see a proxy war break out in the Taiwan Strait between itself, Taiwan and China. Neither does Taiwan, where most people support maintaining the island\u2019s ongoing \u201cstatus quo.\u201d\n\nThe term is deliberately vague, but it encompasses the viewpoint that Taiwan is already de facto independent despite its lack of formal diplomatic recognition. The island, officially known as the Republic of China, is only recognised by a handful of countries, primarily in the Pacific and the Caribbean.\n\nTaiwan is claimed by China\u2019s Communist Party (CCP), which has long threatened to bring it into the fold by force if necessary. Everyday Taiwanese reject that goal, but most do not wish to make a formal declaration of independence because they fear it would lead to a certain war with Beijing.\n\n\u2018Worker for independence\u2019 or \u2018troublemaker\u2019\n\nAs innocuous as the term may sound, supporting the \u201cstatus quo\u201d marks a major ideological shift for Lai, who once upon a time described himself as a \u201cpragmatic worker for Taiwan independence.\u201d\n\nOriginally trained as a doctor, Lai was compelled to enter politics in 1996 in the wake of the Third Strait Crisis, according to his official biography. The incident saw China conduct missile tests in the Taiwan Strait for several months between 1995 and 1996 as Taiwan geared up for its first direct presidential elections.\n\nHe later served as a legislator, mayor and premier of Taiwan, before he made an unsuccessful bid to challenge Tsai as the DPP presidential candidate ahead of her 2020 re-election. Instead, he became vice president after Tsai won a second term in the presidential office in a landslide.\n\n\u201cIf you think about Lai now in comparison to the past, you just couldn\u2019t imagine that he is the same person,\u201d said Sanho Chung, a PhD candidate in political science at the University of Arizona whose work includes Taiwan. \u201cIf you look at Lai as a mayor back in the day or as a lawmaker, he was kind of radical.\u201d\n\nBoth Chung and Nachman said they expected a relatively muted response from Beijing ahead of inauguration day, despite a flare-up earlier this month around Taiwan\u2019s outlying island of Kinmen when more than a dozen Chinese vessels entered the island\u2019s restricted waters to carry out \u201cmaritime exercises\u201d on May 9.\n\nBeijing has continued to send military aircraft into Taiwan\u2019s air defence identification zone, an area of land and sea monitored by the military, but the numbers are consistent with past activity, according to defence analyst Ben Lewis, who tracks Beijing\u2019s activity.\n\nTheir predictions contrast with Beijing\u2019s belligerent response to a visit by then-US Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan in August 2022, when it staged several days of military exercises in the Taiwan Strait.\n\nBeijing repeated the move a year later when Tsai met Kevin McCarthy, another former House speaker, during an unofficial stopover in California on her way home from meeting allies in Central America.\n\nNCCU\u2019s Nachman said China may keep a lower profile as it appears to be attempting to semi-normalise relations with the KMT.\n\nBeijing does not recognise Taiwan\u2019s government and has cut off official communication since the DPP\u2019s victory in 2016, but it has kept up unofficial contact touch with the KMT over the past eight years.\n\nThe KMT and the CCP have a relationship dating back to the 1920s and fought against each other during different stages of the Chinese Civil War, culminating in the KMT\u2019s retreat to Taiwan in the late 1940s.\n\nSince the 1990s, however, the relationship between the two parties has warmed.\n\nFormer KMT President Ma Ying-jeou has made two trips to mainland China over the past two years, becoming the first Taiwanese leader to visit since the end of the Chinese Civil War.\n\nKMT members have also made private visits to China in recent years, including this year and last.\n\nIn contrast, Beijing still considers members of the DPP as dangerous \u201cseparatists\u201d.\n\nNot least the man set to lead the island for the next four years. For China, Lai is not only a \u201cseparatist\u201d but a \u201ctroublemaker\u201d.",

        "text": "Tens of thousands protest against Mexico's president\nTens of thousands of mostly opposition supporters protested Sunday against Mexico's president in the capital's vast colonial-era main plaza ahead of the June presidential election.\n\nThe protesters in Mexico City carried signs saying, \"We are Mexicans,\" referring to what they claim are attempts by President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to divide the country.\n\nMexico is extremely polarized ahead of the June 2 presidential election. Lopez Obrador regularly rails against reporters, the middle class, businesspeople and those he calls \"individualists\" and social climbers.\n\nThe protest was originally called to defend independent electoral agencies the president wants to reduce or defund. But many protesters carried banners supporting opposition candidate Xochitl Galvez. Former Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum of the president's Morena party appears to be leading the race going into the June 2 vote.\n\nMexican presidents are limited to a single six-year term.\n\nMexico City resident Joel Guerra, 59, carried a sign that read, \"Reclaim Mexico.\"\n\n\"The president says that only his supporters are 'the good people' of Mexico, and the rest of us don't have rights,\" Guerra said. \"We are people, too.\"\n\nGuerra was particularly concerned by a new law that Lopez Obrador has passed that seizes unclaimed personal pension accounts to hand out to other retirees.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the people governing us right now have completely divided the country,\" said businesswoman Alana Leal. \"There are two groups of Mexicans, and that's not fair. It's not fair to create so much hate, because at the end of the day, we're all in the same boat, and we are all working for the country's progress.\"\n\nLopez Obrador frequently attacks anyone who disagrees with him as \"racist, classist, conservative.\" He also favors state-owned companies and government handout programs and derides the accumulation of personal wealth.\n\nThe march came before the candidates were to hold their third and final debate late Sunday. Sheinbaum has pledged to try to reconcile Mexicans if she wins, but Leal doubted she would.\n\n\"I think it will be very difficult to achieve a reconciliation between the two groups,\" she said, adding, \"That is very regrettable.\"",

        "text": "Analysis: Why Republicans are likely to win the Senate this year\nCNN \u2014\n\nThe race for the White House hogs most of the attention in a presidential election year, relegating the race for Congress to ugly stepsister status.\n\nBut in recent years, we\u2019ve all learned how important down-ballot races can be in shaping American policy. That\u2019s especially true for the Senate, which is responsible for the confirmations of government officials and Supreme Court nominees.\n\nIn this year\u2019s battle for the Senate, like so many cycles before, we have the same competing forces: The election fundamentals favor Republicans, while candidate quality appears to favor Democrats, who currently hold a narrow majority in the chamber.\n\nFor now, though, it appears even flawed Republican candidates likely won\u2019t be able to stop their side from winning Senate control.\n\nDemocrats face two \u201cM\u201d problems: the math and the map.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the math. Republicans need a net gain of one seat to win the Senate if Donald Trump wins the presidency (with his vice president casting any tie-breaking votes). They need a net gain of two seats for a majority regardless of who wins the presidential election.\n\nRepublicans have a lot of options to net those one or two seats. Senate Democrats (including independents who caucus with them) hold 23 seats up for election this year; Republicans hold 11.\n\nThis brings us to the map.\n\nEight of the 23 Democratic seats up for election this year are in states either where Trump won in 2016 or where he is up by at least 5 points in the polls now. Five of them are in states where Trump holds at least a 5-point advantage. Three are in states where Trump won by at least 8 points in 2016 and 2020 and where the incumbent senator is the only Democrat in nonjudicial statewide office.\n\nOne of those three is West Virginia, where Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin is retiring. Trump won the state by 39 points in 2020, and every respectable nonpartisan handicapping outlet views the seat as a safe Republican pickup.\n\nThere are only two Republican Senate seats being targeted by Democrats \u2013 Florida and Texas, which Trump carried by single digits in 2020. But the GOP incumbents in both states currently lead their Democratic opponents by double digits.\n\nEvery other Republican-held Senate seat on the ballot this year is in a state where GOP presidential candidates have dominated since 2012.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder that my colleague Simone Pathe had only one Republican seat (Texas) on her most recent list of the 10 Senate seats most likely to flip this year, and that was at No. 10.\n\nPositive signs for Democrats\n\nBut is the race for the Senate really over if Republicans just win West Virginia?\n\nNo, we can\u2019t call it just yet, and it\u2019s not just because we\u2019re still months before the general election. It\u2019s because if President Joe Biden does win \u2013 a real possibility \u2013 it\u2019s not entirely clear which second Senate seat Republicans will pick up to gain control.\n\nAmong the eight Democratic Senate seats mentioned above, there are no states beyond West Virginia where the polls (or expert judgment) show Republicans with a solid lead, despite the fundamentals favoring their party this year. Democratic Senate candidates seem to be at least tied or ahead in Arizona, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nThe Democratic Senate candidates\u2019 margins outran Biden\u2019s in the four states \u2013 Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2013 that The New York Times and Siena College recently polled. And we\u2019re not just talking by a little bit; we\u2019re talking about them doing better than Biden by at least 5 points in those four states among likely voters.\n\nA key reason the Democratic candidates are doing so much better than Biden is because they\u2019re popular. We know from recent polls that Sens. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin had positive net favorability ratings, while Biden\u2019s numbers were well under water in these states.\n\nMeanwhile in Arizona, Republicans appear poised to nominate Kari Lake for Senate. Lake was last seen losing a very winnable gubernatorial election in 2022 and her high unfavorable score with state voters was a big reason why Inside Elections recently shifted its rating of the race in the Democratic direction.\n\nOf course, Democratic Senate candidates outrunning the top of the ticket is nothing new. Republicans have memorably lost plenty of very winnable seats over the past decade and a half with bad candidates (see 2010 with Nevada\u2019s Sharron Angle and 2012 with Missouri\u2019s Todd Akin).\n\nTwo years ago, Republicans had a net loss of one Senate seat as Democrats retained control of the chamber in a midterm election when Biden had approval ratings in the low 40s. Again, the GOP ran several unpopular candidates (e.g., Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania), while Democrats ran relatively popular ones (e.g., Mark Kelly in Arizona)\n\nBack to the math and map\n\nStill, it\u2019s hard to ignore Republicans\u2019 advantage in 2024 with the math and the map. Senate Democrats have no margin for error, and they are unlikely to win all seven of their seats currently seen as competitive.\n\nThe past two presidential cycles tell the tale: Just one state (Maine in 2020) voted differently in the presidential and Senate races.\n\nTrump likely holds a comfortable polling advantage of at least 5 points over Biden right now in Arizona, Nevada, Montana and Ohio. His lead in Montana is likely in the double digits. Putting aside the polls, Montana and Ohio were not competitive on the presidential level in either 2016 or 2020 and likely won\u2019t be this fall.\n\nFor Democrats to have any chance of holding the Senate, Republicans would have to lose all these Senate races. Then they\u2019d have to lose in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2013 all states that Trump could very well win again.\n\nRepublicans would also have to lose in Maryland \u2013 where Biden will almost certainly win in a blowout, but where GOP former Gov. Larry Hogan has been competitive in the polling.\n\nRepublicans may be prone to blowing it when it comes to Senate races. But I\u2019m not even sure the Washington Generals of Senate races can blow this one.\n\nAs a memorable \u201cSimpsons\u201d episode once put it, Republicans may finally be \u201cdue.\u201d",

        "text": "An Early Look at Black Voters\u2019 Views on Biden, Trump and Election 2024\nBlack voters are more confident in Biden than Trump when it comes to having the qualities needed to serve another term\n\nVoters cast their ballots at a polling place in downtown Chicago on April 2, 2019. (Kamil Krzaczynski/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nTerminology The terms Black Americans and Black adults are used interchangeably throughout this report to refer to U.S. adults who self-identify as single-race Black and say they have no Hispanic background. Black Americans include those who are registered to vote, not registered or are unsure. Discussions and charts limited to registered voters will be labeled as such and they will be referred to as Black voters. Democrats and Democratic leaners are respondents who identify politically with the Democratic Party or who identify politically as independent or with some other party but lean toward the Democratic Party. Republicans and Republican leaners are respondents who identify politically with the Republican Party or who identify politically as independent or with some other party but lean toward the Republican Party. (In later uses, the terms Democrat and Republican are inclusive of those who lean to each party.)\n\nBlack voters will play a key role in determining the outcome of the 2024 presidential election. And while Black voters remain overwhelmingly Democratic and support Joe Biden over Donald Trump by a wide margin, Biden\u2019s advantage among this group is not as wide as it was four years ago.\n\nToday, American voters are about evenly split between the two major political coalitions, both in their partisan identification and in their presidential vote preference.\n\nBut Black voters remain largely aligned with the Democratic Party (83% identify with or lean to the Democrats), and 77% of Black registered voters say they would prefer to vote for Biden over Trump in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nAt the same time, Black voters are very critical of Trump. Most say he was a poor or terrible president (72%). And many Black adults think he broke the law in his alleged efforts to change the outcome of the 2020 election (65%).\n\nDespite their support for Biden and criticism of Trump, about half of Black voters (49%) say they would replace both Biden and Trump with different candidates if they had the ability to decide. This is similar to the share of all voters who say this.\n\nBlack voters consistently align with the Democratic Party\n\nCurrently, 83% of Black registered voters identify as or lean Democratic, while 12% are Republican or lean Republican. This share is slightly smaller than the 88% who associated with the Democratic Party in 2020. Still, the vast majority of Black voters have consistently identified with or leaned toward the Democratic Party over the last 30 years.\n\nSimilar shares of Black men (81%) and Black women (84%) are affiliated with or lean toward the Democratic Party. Roughly eight-in-ten or more Black men and women have consistently identified with or leaned toward the Democratic Party since 1994.\n\nAlthough the majority of Black voters across education levels are Democrats, there has been a slight decrease in affiliation with the Democratic Party among those with college degrees in recent years. While 93% of Black voters with college degrees identified with or leaned toward the Democratic Party in 2012, that number had decreased to 85% in 2020 and then 79% in 2023.\n\nOverall, older voters have tended to be more Republican than younger voters in recent decades, but this is not true for Black voters. While 7% of Black voters 50 and older currently identify as or lean Republican, 17% of Black voters under 50 are aligned with the Republican Party. This is not new, as younger Black voters have tended to be more Republican than older Black voters over the last 25 years.\n\nWhen it comes to the significance of the 2024 presidential election\u2019s outcome, 55% of Black voters say it really matters who wins. Fewer say it does not matter (17%) or are somewhere in between (28%) in their views of the upcoming election\u2019s importance.\n\nBlack voters\u2019 preferences\n\nAs of April 2024, the majority of Black voters say they would vote for or lean toward Joe Biden (77%). Fewer say they would vote for or lean toward Donald Trump (18%).\n\nAmong all registered voters, 49% favor Trump while 48% support Biden.\n\nThe wide margin between Black voters\u2019 preference for Democratic candidates over Republican candidates is nothing new. In 2016, there was an 85 percentage point difference in the share of Black voters who voted for Hilary Clinton (91%) over Trump (6%). And in 2020, Biden (92%) had a wide advantage over Trump (8%) among Black voters.\n\nThe current margin of support for Biden (59 points \u2013 77% to 18%) is lower than it was in 2020 or for Hillary Clinton in 2016, according to Pew Research Center validated voter studies.\n\nYounger Black voters are more likely than older Black voters to say they would vote for Trump. While about two-thirds of Black voters under 50 favor Biden (68%), 29% support Trump. Black voters 50 and older favor Biden by a wider margin (84% vs. 9%).\n\nHowever, this pattern is reversed among all registered voters: Older voters are slightly more likely than younger voters to prefer Trump (51% vs. 46%), while younger voters prefer Biden (52% vs. 46%).\n\nMany Black voters are dissatisfied with the Biden-Trump matchup\n\nAbout half of Black voters (49%) say they would replace both Trump and Biden with different candidates if they had the ability to do so. An identical share of all registered voters say this.\n\nFewer Black voters say they would keep Biden and replace Trump with a different Republican (36%). Even fewer say they would keep Trump and replace Biden with a different Democrat (8%). And only 6% say they would keep both candidates.\n\nLike the rest of U.S. voters, Black voters differ on this question by age and education. Younger Black voters (57%) are more likely than older voters (37%) to say both candidates should be replaced. And a larger share of older than younger Black voters say they would keep Biden and replace Trump (42% vs. 22%).\n\nNearly 60% of Black voters with a college degree say they would replace both candidates if they had the ability, while 45% of those without a degree say the same.\n\nBlack voters\u2019 views on Biden and Trump as presidents\n\nA majority of Black Americans (55%) approve of the way Joe Biden is handling his job as president.\n\nThis is a shift from a January 2024 Pew Research Center survey, when Black adults were evenly split in their ratings of Biden\u2019s job performance (49% disapproved, 48% approved).\n\nBiden\u2019s ratings among Black Americans were far more positive earlier in his term. For instance, in a March 2021 Center survey, 87% approved of his job performance.\n\nDespite shifts among Black Americans in their ratings of Biden, they are still more likely than other racial and ethnic groups and the U.S. public overall (35%) to approve of Biden\u2019s job performance.\n\nBlack voters are more confident in Biden than Trump\n\nIn further assessments of his presidency, 46% of Black voters say Biden is a great or good president. Far fewer say Trump was great or good during his time in office (12%). And a large majority of Black voters say Trump was a poor or terrible president (72%). Only 19% say the same about Biden.\n\nBlack voters are also much more confident that Biden has the qualities to effectively serve another term as president. A majority of Black voters (56%) are extremely or very confident that Biden respects the country\u2019s democratic values, and half are confident that he acts ethically as president. No more than 8% of Black voters say Trump has either of these qualities.\n\nAlthough most Black voters don\u2019t express much confidence about the mental and physical fitness of either Trump or Biden, they are more confident in Biden. About a third of Black voters (34%) say Biden has the mental fitness needed to serve another term as president, and 26% say the same about his physical fitness. Only about one-in-ten say this about Trump.\n\nBlack voters are more likely than other racial and ethnic groups and the general public overall to say Biden has the mental and physical fitness to serve another term.\n\nTrump\u2019s election-related criminal charges\n\nBeyond their critical views about Trump as president, the majority of Black Americans (65%) also believe he broke the law in an effort to change the outcome of the 2020 election. They are more likely than other racial and ethnic groups \u2013 and the U.S. public overall (45%) \u2013 to hold this view.\n\nBlack Americans\u2019 policy priorities\n\nFor Americans overall, the economy (73%) sits at the top of the list of policy priorities for the president and Congress in 2024.\n\nHowever, for Black Americans, improving the education system (79%) and ensuring Social Security is financially sound (74%) are just as important as strengthening the economy (76%).\n\nClear majorities of Black Americans also say reducing health care costs (72%), dealing with the problems of poor people (70%), reducing crime (68%) and addressing issues around race (65%) should be top priorities.\n\nForeign policy priorities\n\nWhen it comes to international issues, most Black Americans (82%) say it is more important for President Biden to focus on domestic policy than on foreign policy (13%). Most adults in the U.S. share this view, with 83% saying domestic policy is more important.\n\nHowever, when it comes to long-range foreign policy goals, Black adults are more likely than the general public to say that preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction (73% vs. 63%), reducing the spread of infectious diseases (70% vs. 52%) and dealing with global climate change (52% vs. 44%) should be top priorities.\n\nCORRECTION (May 20, 2024): Due to an editorial error, a previous version of the report overstated the share of Black adults who say Trump broke the law in seeking to change the outcome of the 2020 election. It was 65%.",

Because of the large influx of misinformation, Taiwan has taken a public crowdsourcing approach to combatting misinformation, using both fact-checking ChatBots and public dataset called CoFacts. Combining CoFacts with large-language models (LLM), we investigated misinformation across three platforms (Line, PTT, and Facebook) during the 2024 Taiwanese presidential election. We found that most misinformation appears within China-friendly political groups and attacks US-Taiwan relations through visual media like images and videos. A considerable proportion of misinformation does not question U.S. foreign policy directly. Rather, it exaggerates domestic issues in the United States to create a sense of declining U.S. state capacity. Curiously, we found misinformation rhetoric that references conspiracy groups in the West.\n\nimage by mohamed_Hassan on Pixabay\n\nResearch Questions What are the misinformation narratives surrounding the election in Taiwan and how do they target international relations with the United States?\n\nWhat geographical or temporal patterns emerge from misinformation data?\n\nWho are the targets of these misinformation narratives and through what modalities? Essay Summary We leveraged a dataset of 41,291 labeled articles from Line, 911,510 posts from Facebook, and 2,005,972 posts and comments from PTT to understand misinformation dynamics through topic modeling and network analysis.\n\nThe primary form of misinformation is narratives that attack international relations with the United States (henceforth referred to as US-skepticism), specifically referencing the economy, health policy, the threat of war through Ukraine, and other U.S. domestic issues.\n\nTemporal and spatial evidence suggests VPN-based coordination, focused on U.S. issues and addresses.\n\nMisinformation is most common among pan-Blue and ROC identity groups on social media and is spread through visual media. These groups share many themes with conspiracy groups in Western countries.\n\nOur study shows the prevalence of misinformation strategies using visual media and fake news websites. It also highlights how crowdsourcing and advances in large-language models can be used to identify misinformation in cross-platform workflows.\n\nImplications\n\nAccording to Freedom House, Taiwan has one of the highest indices for free speech in Asia (Freedom House, 2022). Additionally, due to its contentious history with China, it receives significant foreign interference and misinformation, especially during its presidential elections. Due to the large influx of dis- and misinformation, Taiwan has developed many strategies to counter misleading narratives, including fact-checking ChatBots on its most popular chatroom app (Chang et al., 2020). Under this information environment, the 2024 Taiwanese presidential election emerged as one of the most divisive elections in Taiwan\u2019s history, featuring at one point a doubling of presidential candidates in a typically two-party race, from two to four. As such, Taiwan is regarded as a \u201ccanary for disinformation\u201d against elections in 2024, as a first indicator to how foreign interference may take place in other democracies (Welch, 2024).\n\nIn this paper, we study the misinformation ecosystem in Taiwan starting a year prior to the election. First, our findings highlight the interaction between misinformation and international relations. As was reported in The Economist and The New York Times, a considerable portion of the misinformation spread in Taiwan before the 2024 election is about US-skepticism, which aims at undermining the reputation of the United States among Taiwanese people (\u201cChina is flooding Taiwan with disinformation,\u201d 2023; Hsu, Chien, and Myers, 2023). This phenomenon is significant because it does not target specific candidates or parties in the election but may indirectly influence the vote choice between pro- and anti-U.S. parties. Given the US-China global competition and the Russia-Ukraine ongoing conflict, the reputation of the United States is crucial for the strength and reliability of democratic allies (Cohen, 2003). Hence, it is not surprising that misinformation about the United States may propagate globally and influence elections across democracies. However, our findings surprisingly show that US-skepticism also includes a considerable number of attacks on U.S. domestic politics. Such content does not question the U.S. foreign policy but undermines the perceived reliability and state capacity of the United States. Here, state capacity is defined as whether a state is capable of mobilizing its resources to realize its goal, which is conceptually different from motivation and trust.\n\nUS-skepticism is commonly characterized as mistrusting the motivations of the United States, as illustrated in the Latin American context due to long histories of political influence (see dependency theory; Galeano, 1997), but our findings suggest that perceived U.S. state capacity is also an important narrative. As most foreign disinformation arises from China, this indicates a greater trend where authoritarian countries turn to sharp power tactics to distort information and defame global competitors rather than winning hearts and minds through soft power. Sharp power refers to the ways in which authoritarian regimes project their influence abroad to pierce, penetrate, or perforate the informational environments in targeted countries (Walker, 2018). In Taiwan\u2019s case, China may not be able to tell China\u2019s story well, but can still influence Taiwanese voters by making them believe that the United States is declining. Our findings suggest that future work analyzing the topics and keywords of misinformation in elections outside the United States should also consider the US-skepticism as one latent category, not just the politicians and countries as is common with electoral misinformation (Tenove et al., 2018). These findings are corroborated by narratives identified by a recent report including drug issues, race relations, and urban decay (Microsoft Threat Intelligence, 2024).\n\nAdditionally, our research investigates both misinformation and conspiracy theories, which are closely related. Whereas misinformation is broadly described as \u201cfalse or inaccurate information\u201d (Jerit & Zhao, 2020), a conspiracy theory is the belief that harmful events are caused by a powerful, often secretive, group. In particular, conspiracy communities often coalesce around activities of \u201ctruth-seeking,\u201d embodying a contrarian view toward commonly held beliefs (Enders et al., 2022; Harambam, 2020; Konkes & Lester, 2017). Our findings also provide evidence of transnational similarities between conspiracy groups in Taiwan and the United States. Whereas the domestic context has been explored (Chen et al., 2023; Jerit & Zhao, 2020), the intersection of partisanship and conspiracy groups as conduits for cross-national misinformation flow deserves further investigation.\n\nSecond, our findings reemphasize that an IP address is not a reliable criterion for attributing foreign intervention. Previous studies on Chinese cyber armies show that they use a VPN for their activities on Twitter (now X) (Wang et al., 2020) and Facebook (Frenkel, 2023). Commonly known as the Reddit of Taiwan, PTT is a public forum in Taiwan that by default contains the IP address of the poster. Our analysis of PTT located a group of accounts with US IP addresses that have the same activity pattern as other Taiwan-based accounts. Therefore, it is likely that these accounts use VPN to hide their geolocation. Our results provide additional evidence that this VPN strategy also appears on secondary and localized social media platforms. Our results suggest that the analysis of the originating location of misinformation should not be based entirely on IP addresses.\n\nThird, our findings show that text is far from the only format used in the spread of misinformation. A considerable amount of misinformation identified on Facebook is spread through links (47%), videos (21%), and photos (15%). These items may echo each other\u2019s content or even feature cross-platform flow. Proper tools are needed to extract and juxtapose content from different types of media so that researchers can have a holistic analysis of the spread and development of misinformation (Tucker et al., 2018). Such tools are urgent since mainstream social media has adopted and highly encouraged short videos\u2014a crucial area for researchers to assess how misinformation spreads across platforms in the upcoming year of elections. This understanding is also important for fact-check agencies because they must prepare for collecting and reviewing information on various topics found in multiple media types across platforms. Crowdsourcing, data science, expert inputs, and international collaboration are all needed to deal with multi-format misinformation environments.\n\nWith prior studies showing that the aggregated fact checks (known as wisdom of the crowds) perform on par with expert ratings (see Arechar et al., 2023; Martel et al., 2023), our case study also evidences how crowdsourcing and LLM approaches can not only quickly fact-check but also summarize larger narrative trends. In Taiwan, this takes form of the CoFacts open dataset, which we use to identify misinformation narratives. CoFacts is a project initiated by g0v (pronounced \u201cgov zero\u201d), a civic hacktivism community in Taiwan that started in 2012. CoFacts started as a fact-checking ChatBot that circumvents the closed nature of chatroom apps, where users can forward suspicious messages or integrate the ChatBot into private rooms. These narratives are then sent to a database. Individual narratives are subsequently reviewed by more than 2,000 volunteers, including teachers, doctors, students, engineers, and retirees (Haime, 2022). As a citizen-initiated project, it is not affiliated with any government entity or party.\n\nCrucially, these reviews provide valuable labels that are used to train AI models and fine-tune LLMs. The dataset is available open source on the popular deep-learning platform HuggingFace. Just as AI and automation can be used to spread misinformation (Chang, 2023; Chang & Ferrara, 2022; Ferrara et al., 2020; Monaco & Woolley, 2022), it can also help combat \u201cfake news\u201d through human-AI collaboration.\n\nFindings\n\nFinding 1: The primary form of misinformation is narratives that attack international relations with the United States (henceforth referred to as US-skepticism), specifically referencing the economy, health policy, the threat of war through Ukraine, and other U.S. domestic issues.\n\nThe status quo between China and Taiwan is marked by Taiwan\u2019s self-identification as a sovereign state, which is in contrast to China\u2019s view of Taiwan as part of its territory under the \u201cOne China\u201d policy. As brief context, China has claimed Taiwan as its territory since 1949, but the United States has helped maintain the status quo and peace after the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950. After democratization in 1987, Taiwan\u2019s politics have been dominated by a clear blue-green division. The blue camp is led by Kuomintang (Nationalist Party, KMT hereafter), the founding party of the Republic of China (ROC, the formal name of Taiwan\u2019s government based on its constitution) who was defeated by the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and retreated to Taiwan in 1949. The green camp is led by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which pursues revising the ROC Constitution and changing the country\u2019s name to Taiwan. The political cleavage between the blue and green camps is dictated by Taiwan\u2019s relationship with the PRC and the United States. The blue camp\u2019s position is that the PRC and ROC are under civil war but belong to the same Chinese nation, and thus the blue camp appreciates military support from the United States while enhancing economic and cultural cooperation with the PRC. The green camp believes that the necessary conditions for Taiwan to be free and independent are to stand firmly with the United States and maintain distance from the PRC. After 2020, the two major camps\u2019 insufficient attention to domestic and social issues caused the rise of nonpartisans and a third party, the Taiwan People\u2019s Party (TPP or the white camp), which strategically avoids discussing foreign policies. In the 2024 election, the ruling DPP party (green) was reelected with 40% of votes for the third consecutive presidency (from 2016 to 2028), while KMT (blue) and TPP (white) received 33% and 26% of votes, respectively.\n\nThe U.S. \u201cOne China\u201d policy since 1979 indicates that the United States opposes any change to the status quo unless it is solved peacefully. This has motivated the PRC to persuade Taiwanese citizens to support unification using misinformation targeted at China-friendly political groups, as the cost of unification would be greatly reduced if sufficient Taiwanese citizens opposed U.S. military intervention. This history between the United States and Taiwan serves as the foundation of US-skepticism. In the literature, US-skepticism in Taiwan is composed of two key psychological elements: trust and motivation (Wu & Lin, 2019; Wu, 2023). First, many Taiwanese no longer trust the United States after the United States switched diplomatic ties from Taiwan (ROC) to the PRC in 1979. Many blue-camp supporters doubt the commitment of the United States to send troops should China invade, per the Taiwan Relations Act (Wu & Lin, 2019). Second, Taiwanese citizens question Taiwan\u2019s role as a proxy in a potential war with China instead of sincerely protecting democracy and human rights in Taiwan (Wu, 2023).\n\nThe CoFacts dataset contains 140,314 articles submitted by Line users, which are then fact-checked by volunteers as rumor (47%), not a rumor (21%), not an article (19%), and opinion (13%). Here, rumor is synonymous with misinformation. Using the CoFacts dataset, we trained a BERTopic model to identify 34 forms of misinformation and then ranked them by their overlap with the word \u201celections\u201d in Mandarin Chinese (George & Sumathy, 2023; Nguyen et al., 2020).

Top misinformation narratives identified using BERTopic, then ranked by their salience to the 2024 Taiwanese presidential election.\n\nMany of these narratives are directly related to political parties or the democratic process. For instance, the highest-ranked topic is attacking the incumbent party (the DPP) at 18.1%, which contains 2,371 total posts. The subsequent misinformation topics focus on policy issues and specific narratives\u2014international relations, issues of marriage and birth rate, vaccines, nuclear energy, biometrics, egg imports, and the war in Ukraine. These are known cleavage issues and overlap with the eight central concerns during the election cycle\u2014economic prosperity, cross-strait affairs, wealth distribution, political corruption, national security, social reform/stability, and environmental protection (Achen & Wang, 2017; Achen & Wang, 2019; Chang & Fang, 2023).\n\nWe focus on the third type of misinformation, which is the relationship between Taiwan, the United States, and China. US-skepticism is not only the largest at 10,826 individual posts, but one flagged by journalists, policymakers, and politicians as one of the most crucial themes. This is a relatively new phenomenon in terms of proportion, which aims to sow distrust toward the United States (\u201cChina is flooding Taiwan with disinformation,\u201d 2023). In contrast, questioning the fairness of process (i.e. ballot numbers) and policy positions (i.e. gay marriage) are common during elections. However, US-skeptical misinformation diverges in that there is no explicit political candidate or party targeted. By sampling the topic articles within this category and validating using an LLM-summarizer through the ChatGPT API, we identified three specific narratives:\n\n(a) The United States and the threat of war: Ukraine intersects frequently in this topic, with videos of direct military actions. Example: \u201cDid you hear former USA military strategist Jack Keane say the Ukrainian war is an investment. The USA spends just $66,000,000,000 and can make Ukraine and Russia fight\u2026 Keane then mentions Taiwan is the same, where Taiwanese citizens are an \u2018investment\u2019 for Americans to fight a cheap war. The USA is cold and calculating, without any actual intent to help Taiwan!\u201d\n\n(b) Economic atrophy due to fiscal actions by the United States: These narratives focus on domestic policy issues in Taiwan such as minimum wage and housing costs. Example: \u201cThe USA printed 4 trillion dollars and bought stocks everywhere in the world, including Taiwan, and caused inflation and depressed wages. Be prepared!\u201d\n\n(c) Vaccine supply and the United States: While some narratives focus on the efficacy of vaccines, several describe the United States intentionally limiting supply during the pandemic. Example: \u201cTaiwanese Dr. Lin is a leading scientist at Moderna, yet sells domestically at $39 per two doses, $50 to Israel. Taiwan must bid at least $60! The United States clearly does not value Taiwan.\u201d\n\nThese narratives reveal a new element to US-skepticism: state capacity. As previously mentioned, state capacity is defined as whether a state is capable of mobilizing its resources to realize its goal. The Ukraine war and vaccine supply narratives both question the United States\u2019 motivations in foreign policies and perceived trustworthiness. Meanwhile, the economic atrophy narrative is based on the United States\u2019 domestic budgetary deficit and downstream impact on Taiwanese economy. These narratives frame U.S. state capacity as declining and imply that the United States could no longer realize any other commitment due to its lack of resources and capacity. The goal of such a narrative is to lower the Taiwanese audience\u2019s belief that the United States will help. But such a narrative does not include keywords of its target group (e.g., Taiwan) nor the PCR\u2019s goal (e.g., unification) and only works through framing and priming as an example of sharp power.\n\nThe specific focus of misinformation narratives related to the United States is composed of Ukraine (28.8%), the economy and fiscal policies (33.1%), technology (25.2%), and vaccine supply (9.9%). Misinformation related to state capacity takes up approximately 52.4%, more than half of all narratives (see Figure A1, part a in the Appendix). In all narratives, political parties are only referenced 27.8% of the time with the DPP the primary target (26.2%), which is almost half of the proportion for state capacity. China is only mentioned in tandem with the United States in 38.4% of the posts (see Figure A1, part b in the Appendix).\n\nFinding 2: Temporal and spatial evidence suggests VPN-based coordination, focused on U.S. issues and addresses.\n\nOnce we identified the top misinformation narratives using Line, we investigated information operations or coordination. Line is one of Taiwan\u2019s most popular communication apps featuring chatrooms (similar to WhatsApp), with 83% usage. One limitation of Line is that although we can analyze message content, Line chatrooms can be seen as conversations behind \u201cclosed doors\u201d\u2014platforms cannot impose content moderation and researchers have no access to the users themselves nor to the private chatroom in which users engage with misinformation (Chang et al., 2020). PTT, on the other hand, provides a public forum-like environment in which users can interact. Figure 1 shows the co-occurrence network of users who post comments under the same forum. Each circle (node) represents a user who posts on PTT. If two users make mutual comments on more than 200 posts, then they are connected (form a tie). Intuitively, this means if two users are connected or \u201cclose\u201d to each other by mutual connections, then they are likely coordinating or have extremely similar behaviors. The placement of the users reflects this and is determined by their connections.\n\nFigure 1. Co-occurrence network of PTT commenting users based on the posts, with at least 200 co-occurrences. Colors are determined through the Louvain community detection algorithm.\n\nUsing the Louvain algorithm (Traag, 2015), a common method to identify communities on social networks, five communities emerged from our dataset. Each community is colored separately, with clear clusters, except for teal which is more integrated. In particular, the yellow cluster is significantly separate from the others. This means they share significant activity amongst their own community, but less so with other communities. This suggests premeditated coordination rather than organic discussion, as the users would have to target the same post with high frequency. Prior studies have shown analyzing temporal patterns can provide insight into information operations. Specifically, overseas content farms often follow a regular cadence, posting content before peak hours in Taiwan on Twitter (Wang et al., 2020) and YouTube (Hsu & Lin, 2023).\n\nTo better understand the temporal dynamics on PTT, we plotted the distribution of posts and comments over a 24-hour period. Specifically, we focused on the top two countries by volume\u2014Taiwan and the United States. Figure 2, part a shows the time of posting. Taiwan\u2019s activity increases from 6 in the morning until it peaks at noon (when people are on lunch break), then steadily declines into the night. In contrast, posts from the United States peak at midnight and 8 a.m. Taipei time, which corresponds to around noon and 8 p.m. in New York, respectively. This provides an organic baseline as to when we might expect people to post.\n\nFigure 2. Temporal density of a) postings and b) comments. The coordinated group (green) represents the suspicious group from Figure 1 and has a sharp increase of activity at 10 a.m. sharp and a mixture of Taiwanese and US hours.\n\nHowever, in Figure 2, part b, while the distribution for Taiwan (blue) remains unchanged, the peak for the United States (orange) occurs at the same time as Taiwan. One explanation is that users are responding to posts in Taiwan. The second is that users in Asia\u2014potentially China\u2014are using a VPN to appear as if they are in the United States. This coincides with a report by Meta Platforms that found large numbers of CCP-operated Facebook accounts and subsequently removed them (Frenkel, 2023).\n\nThe more curious issue is when considering the activity of the yellow group from Figure 1, the temporal pattern (green) shows a sharp increase in activity at 10 a.m., which then coincides with both the peaks for Taiwan (12) and the United States (22). The sudden burst of activity is consistent with prior findings on content farms from China, where posting behavior occurs when content farm workers clock in regularly for work (Wang et al., 2020). While it is difficult to prove the authenticity of these accounts, the structural and temporal aspects suggest coordination. Figure A2 in the appendix shows further evidence of coordination through the frequency distribution of counts for co-occurring posts. For the US-based group, a distribution akin to a power law appears, commonly found within social systems (Adamic & Huberman, 2000; Chang et al., 2023; Clauset et al., 2009). In contrast, the coordinated group features a significantly heavier tail, with a secondary, \u201cunnatural,\u201d peak at around 15 co-occurrences.\n\nTo better understand the content of these groups, Table A1 shows the summary of comments of each group and the originating post, using a large-language model for abstractive summarization (see Methods). We report the top points for comments and posts in Table A1. The coordinated community focuses on businessman Terry Gou, who considered running as a blue-leaning independent. The comments attack the incumbent DPP and their stance toward foreign policy. One popular post features President Tsai\u2019s controversial meeting with Kevin McCarthy, then the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. When a journalist asked McCarthy if he would \u201cinvite President Tsai to Congress\u2026 or\u2026 Washington,\u201d McCarthy replied, \u201cI don\u2019t have any invitation out there right now. Today we were able to meet her as she transits through America, I thought that was very productive.\u201d While this was positively framed, the title of the post itself was translated as \u201cMcCarthy will not invite Tsai to the United States\u201d (Doomdied, 2023). This takes on a common tactic in misinformation where statements are intentionally distorted to produce negative framings of a particular candidate.\n\nComments from U.S. IP addresses between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. focus on the potential alliance between the KMT and TPP. These posts are KMT-leaning with criticism toward both Lai and Ko, who are two oppositional candidates to the KMT. Some users argue that while the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is a negative force, the United States is not automatically a positive force, as the United States does not explicitly support Taiwan\u2019s international recognition or economic integration. In general, both posts and comments express that Taiwan should not rely too heavily on either China or the United States. This echoes the element of trust in the US-skepticism from the historical experience between ROC and the United States.\n\nBoth the U.S.-based and coordinated groups appear as blue-leaning audiences. What differentiates the first and second case is clear evidence of misinformation in the former through inaccurate framing. While US-skepticism may be a valid political stance, if the ambient information environment contains inaccurate information, then the democratic deliberative process is at risk. The case of US-skepticism is also one where stance and truth-value are often conflated, which may influence the process of voter deliberation.\n\nFinding 3: Misinformation is most common among pan-Blue and ROC identity groups on social media and is spread through visual media. These groups share themes with conspiracy groups in Western countries.\n\nLastly, we considered the groups in which misinformation is common and the way misinformation is delivered. To do so, we queried CrowdTangle using the titles and links from the CoFacts dataset specific to US-Taiwan relations. This yielded 4,632 posts from public groups. Table 2 shows the groups ranked by the total number of misinformation articles identified.\n\nThere are two themes to these groups. First, they are often pan-Blue media outlets (CTI News), politician support groups (Wang Yo-Zeng Support Group), and ROC national identity groups (I\u2019m an ROC Fan). The second type is somewhat unexpected but extremely interesting; it consists of groups that espouse freedom of speech (Support CTI News and Free Speech) and truth-seeking (Truth Engineering Taiwan Graduate School), topics often regarded as conspiracies. These topics are reminiscent of those in the West, such as the rhetoric around \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201ctruthers,\u201d and paint a transnational picture of how misinformation coalesces. The second largest group is Trump for the World, which supports a politician known to court conspiracy theory groups such as QAnon. These groups also serve as the \u201ccapacity\u201d element of US-skepticism, implying that the United States is in trouble for its domestic issues and is not a reliable partner to Taiwan. Furthermore, these groups have sizable followings\u2014ranging from 8,279 to 43,481. We show the mean, as the total number of members fluctuated over our one-year period.\n\nChinese English Translation # Misinfo Identified Mean # of Members \u5929\u6012\u4eba\u6028 \u5b98\u903c\u6c11\u53cd Civil Revolt 77 43,481.23 \u795e\u4f7f\u5ddd\u666e\u5efa\u559c\u6a02\u81fa\u6e2f Trump for the World 64 13,531.97 \u5feb\u6a02\u5fd7\u5de5\u7fa4 Happy Volunteer Group 55 23,642.05 \u738b\u53c8\u6b63\u5f8c\u63f4\u7e3d\u6703 Wang Yo-Zeng Support Group 54 27,846.6 \u300c\u529b\u633a\u4e2d\u5929\u65b0\u805e\u300d\u2665\ufe0f\u634d\u885e\u65b0\u805e\u8a00\u8ad6\u81ea\u7531\u3297\ufe0f\ud83c\ude35\ufe0f Support CTI News and Free Speech 53 3,207.782 \u771f\u76f8\u5de5\u7a0b\u53f0\u7063\u7814\u7a76\u6240/\u4ee5\u8272\u5217\u6050\u6016\u4efd\u5b50/\u7f8e\u570b\u6df1\u5c64\u653f\u5e9c/\u75ab\u82d7\u526f\u4f5c\u7528/\u65b7\u98df\u7642\u6cd5/\u65b0\u805e\u6642\u4e8b\u7206\u6599\u8a0e\u8ad6/\u91ab\u7642\u9748\u5a92/\u71df\u990a\u7642\u6cd5/\u6297\u764c\u81ea\u7136\u7642\u6cd5/\u5927\u85e5\u5ee0FDA\u5167\u5e55/\u5047\u7336\u592a\u4eba Truth Engineering Taiwan Graduate School / Israel Terrorism / USA Deep Government / Fasting / News Discussion 42 24,204.07 \u6211\u662f\u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u570b\u7c89 I\u2019m an ROC Fan 42 7,5217.38 \u5f6d\u6587\u6b63 \u201c\u52a0\u6cb9 \u8b9a\u201d Peng Wen-Jeng Support 40 87,088.3 \u634d\u885b\u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u570b Protecting ROC 39 8,278.644 \u4e2d\u570b\u7279\u8272\u793e\u6703\u4e3b\u7fa9 \u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u65cf\u5049\u5927\u5fa9\u8208 Chinese Socialism ROC Revival Group 38 10,577.66 Table 2. Top public Facebook groups containing references to US-skepticism misinformation.\n\nLastly, we found that the majority of misinformation contains some form of multimedia, such as video (36%) or photos (15%), as shown in Figure 3, part a. Only 1% is a direct status. This may be due to CrowdTangle not surfacing results from normal users, but the ratio of multimedia to text is quite high. This aligns with extant studies showing the growth of multimodal misinformation (Micallef et al., 2022) and also user behavior in algorithm optimization (Chang et al., 2022; Dhanesh et al., 2022; Pulley, 2020)\u2014posts with multimedia tend to do better than posts with only text.\n\nMoreover, 47% contain a URL. Figure 3, part b shows one of the top domains containing misinformation (beyondnews852.com) after filtering out common domains such as YouTube. The site is named \u201cBeyond News Net\u201d and is visually formatted like a legitimate news site to increase the perceived credibility of information (Flanagin & Metzger, 2007; W\u00f6lker & Powell, 2021). The ability to rapidly generate legitimate-looking news sites as a tactic for misinformation may become a challenge for both media literacy and technical approaches to fight misinformation.\n\nFigure 3. Modalities of US-skeptical misinformation on Facebook public groups. Figure 3a shows the top modalities of misinformation. Figure 3b shows a popular template website that hosts misinformation (beyondnews852.com).\n\nMethods\n\nWe utilized three unique misinformation datasets\u2014Line, Facebook, and PTT\u2014with dates between 01/12/2023 and 11/10/2023. The CoFacts dataset includes 140,193 received messages, 96,432 that have been labeled as misinformation, facts, opinion, or not relevant. Of this, 41,564 entries are misinformation. The CoFacts dataset is not only methodologically useful but exemplifies a crowd-sourced approach to fact-checking misinformation as an actual platform intervention. Moreover, it is public and transparent, allowing for replicability. Using a subset of articles and posts containing misinformation, we trained a topic model using BERTopic (Grootendorst, 2022). On a high level, using BERTopic involves five steps: 1) extract embeddings using a sentence transformer, 2) reduce dimensionality, 3) cluster reduced embeddings, 4) tokenize topics, and 5) create topic representation.\n\nWe conducted several trials, experimenting with parameters such as different sentence transformer models and minimum cluster sizes for the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm. The model used to extract topics for this paper utilized paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2 for our sentence embedding model (Reimers & Gurevych, 2019), had a minimum cluster size of 80 for the clustering algorithm, and used tokenize_zh for our tokenizer. Our model yielded 34 topics. We also trained a model based on latent-Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003), but found the BERTopic results to be more interpretable. We then labeled all messages to indicate whether they included reference to the election or not, and ranked the topics by their election-related percentage to measure electoral salience. For our subsequent analysis, we focused on topic 3 (see Table 1), which captures general discourse about the relations between the United States, China, and Taiwan.\n\nThe Facebook dataset was extracted using CrowdTangle. We queried posts containing links and headlines from topic 3. We also cross-sectioned these links and headlines with a general election-based dataset with 911,510 posts. This yielded a total of 4,632 of posts shared on public Facebook groups and 227,125 engagements. Due to privacy concerns, it is not possible to obtain private posts from users on their own Facebook timelines, private groups, or messages. However, public groups are a good proxy for general discourse, in addition to providing ethnic or partisan affiliations via their group name (Chang & Fang, 2023). In other words, while CoFacts provides the misinformation narratives, Facebook public groups give insight into the targets of misinformation.\n\nLastly, we scraped PTT using Selenium. Commonly known as the Reddit of Taiwan, PTT is unique in that it contains the IP address of the poster, though this could be shrouded by proxy farms or VPNs. First, we scraped all posts that contained reference to the United States and the election, which yielded 22,576 posts and 1,983,396 comments, all with IP addresses, addresses provided by PTT, and the time of posting. We expanded the scope of this analysis as we were interested in the general discourse directly related to the United States, and the geospatial and temporal patterns that arose.\n\nDue to the large amount of data, there are three general approaches we could have taken\u2014local extractive summarization with LLMs, local abstractive summarization with LLMs, and server-based abstractive summarization (such as ChatGPT). Local extractive summarization is a method that embeds each of the input sentences and then outputs five of the most representative sentences. However, this approach is often too coarse, as it returns sentences with the highest centrality but does not summarize general themes across all the different comments or posts. On the other hand, abstractive summarization works by considering the entire context by ingesting many documents and then summarizing across them. This provides a more generalized characterization of key themes. However, the input size is the primary bottleneck as large-language models can only ingest so many tokens (or words), which also need to be held in memory\u2014the case for our project, as we are summarizing more than 10,000 posts.\n\nTo circumvent these issues, we sampled the maximum number of posts or comments that could fit within 16,000 tokens and then made a query call using the ChatGPT API. This provided a summary based on a probabilistic sample of the posts and comments.",

        "text": "US 2024 election: What to expect in Kentucky's primaries\nAll of Donald Trump's top opponents for the Republican nomination for president dropped out of the race weeks ago, but the whole gang will be back together on Kentucky's primary ballot Tuesday.\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie all suspended their campaigns after Kentucky finalized its ballot in January, as did pastor Ryan Binkley.\n\nTrump has easily won nearly every Republican contest so far, but Haley has won a significant number of votes in several recent primaries, including Maryland (20%) and Nebraska (18%) this week.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's opponents in Kentucky are author Marianne Williamson and U.S. Representative Dean Phillips. Democrats can also vote for \u201cuncommitted,\u201d which has attracted protest votes in other states.\n\nKentucky voters will also decide six primaries for the U.S. House. One race to watch is the 4th Congressional District Republican primary. Representative Thomas Massie, who backed DeSantis\u2019 presidential bid and co-sponsored a motion to remove House Speaker Mike Johnson, is facing a challenge from Eric Deters, a staunch Trump supporter. However, Deters hadn\u2019t reported raising any money as of the latest filing deadline and placed fourth in the 2023 gubernatorial primary.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what to expect on Tuesday.\n\nPrimary day\n\nKentucky will hold presidential primaries and will also choose nominees for the U.S. House, the state legislature and the state Senate. Polls will close locally at 6 p.m. across the state. However, Kentucky is nearly cut in half by time zones; most of it falls in the Eastern time zone, while 41 counties in the western part of the state are on Central time.\n\nWho gets to vote\n\nKentucky has a closed primary system, which means that only voters registered with a political party may participate in that party\u2019s primary. Democrats may not vote in the Republican primary or vice versa. Independent or unaffiliated voters may not participate in either primary.\n\nDelegate allocation rules\n\nKentucky Republicans allocate their 46 delegates proportionally to any candidate who receives more than 15% of the vote, meaning any of Trump's opponents could qualify for delegates. They could also splinter the anti-Trump vote, increasing Trump\u2019s chances of being the only candidate to receive 15% of the vote and therefore the only candidate to receive any delegates.\n\nKentucky\u2019s 53 pledged Democratic delegates are allocated according to the national party\u2019s standard rules. Twelve at-large delegates are allocated in proportion to the statewide vote, as are six PLEO delegates, or \u201cparty leaders and elected officials.\u201d The state\u2019s six congressional districts have a combined 35 delegates at stake, which are allocated in proportion to the vote results in each district. Candidates must receive at least 15% of the statewide vote to qualify for any statewide delegates, and 15% of the vote in a congressional district to qualify for delegates in that district.\n\nDecision notes\n\nWhile Republican state parties that hold primaries this late in the cycle tend to embrace a winner-takes-all system for delegate allocation, Kentucky Republicans are dividing their delegates proportionally among candidates who receive at least 15% of the vote.\n\nFor signs that a candidate not named Trump could reach that 15% threshold, look to suburban areas like Louisville and Lexington. Those areas \u2014 Jefferson and Fayette counties \u2014 are also the biggest sources of GOP votes in the state.\n\nIn the 2020 presidential primary, \u201cuncommitted\u201d and Trump were the only two options on the Republican ballot. Statewide, \u201cuncommitted\u201d received 13% of the vote in the GOP primary. In Jefferson County, however, \u201cuncommitted\u201d received 23%.\n\nIn the 4th Congressional District \u2014 which runs along the Ohio River, sharing its northern boundary with Indiana and Ohio \u2014 the United Democracy Project, a group that has criticized Massie for his record on Israel, had spent $328,672 on the race as of last Tuesday. However, those ads have not supported an alternative candidate.\n\nThe AP does not make projections and will declare a winner only when it\u2019s determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap. If a race has not been called, the AP will continue to cover any newsworthy developments, such as candidate concessions or declarations of victory. In doing so, the AP will make clear that it has not yet declared a winner and explain why.\n\nKentucky mandates a recount if the top candidate wins by less than 0.5 percentage point. However, that recount rule does not apply to the presidential race. Candidates can ask for a recanvass of the vote, which entails retabulating the vote totals, if the margin is less than 1 percentage point. However, to request a recount, in which each ballot is hand-counted, a court must approve and prescribe the procedure.\n\nWhat do turnout and the advance vote look like?\n\nAs of March 31, there were 3,487,292 registered voters in Kentucky. Of those voters, 43% were Democrats and 46% were Republicans.\n\nIn 2022, 17% of voters cast their ballots before Election Day.\n\nHow long does vote-counting usually take?\n\nIn the 2023 primary election, the AP first reported results at 6:03 p.m. Eastern time, or three minutes after the first polls closed. The election night tabulation ended at 9:56 p.m. with about 98% of total votes counted.\n\nAre we there yet?\n\nAs of Tuesday, there will be 168 days until the November general election.",

The question of who can best steer the U.S. economy could be a deciding factor in November's election .",
        "text": "Many remember solid economy under Trump, but his record also full of tax cut hype, debt and disease\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 It was a time of fear and chaos four years ago.\n\nThe death count was mounting as COVID-19 spread. Financial markets were panicked. Oil prices briefly went negative. The Federal Reserve slashed its benchmark interest rates to combat the sudden recession. And the U.S. government went on a historic borrowing spree \u2014 adding trillions to the national debt \u2014 to keep families and businesses afloat.\n\nBut as Donald Trump recalled that moment at a recent rally, the former president exuded pride.\n\n\u201cWe had the greatest economy in history,\u201d the Republican told his Wisconsin audience. \u201cThe 30-year mortgage rate was at a record low, the lowest ever recorded ... 2.65%, that\u2019s what your mortgage rates were.\u201d\n\nThe question of who can best steer the U.S. economy could be a deciding factor in who wins November\u2019s presidential election. While an April Gallup poll found that Americans were most likely to say that immigration is the country\u2019s top problem, the economy in general and inflation were also high on the list.\n\nTrump may have an edge over President Joe Biden on key economic concerns, according to an April poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs. The survey found that Americans were more likely to say that as president, Trump helped the country with job creation and cost of living. Nearly 6 in 10 Americans said that Biden\u2019s presidency hurt the country on the cost of living.\n\nBut the economic numbers expose a far more complicated reality during Trump\u2019s time in the White House. His tax cuts never delivered the promised growth. His budget deficits surged and then stayed relatively high under Biden. His tariffs and trade deals never brought back all of the lost factory jobs.\n\nWhat to know about Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nAnd there was the pandemic, an event that caused historic job losses for which Trump accepts no responsibility as well as low inflation \u2014 for which Trump takes full credit.\n\nIf anything, the economy during Trump\u2019s presidency never lived up to his own hype.\n\nDECENT (NOT EXCEPTIONAL) GROWTH\n\nTrump assured the public in 2017 that the U.S. economy with his tax cuts would grow at \u201c3%,\u201d but he added, \u201cI think it could go to 4, 5, and maybe even 6%, ultimately.\u201d\n\nIf the 2020 pandemic is excluded, growth after inflation averaged 2.67% under Trump, according to figures from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Include the pandemic-induced recession and that average drops to an anemic 1.45%.\n\nBy contrast, growth during the second term of then-President Barack Obama averaged 2.33%. So far under Biden, annual growth is averaging 3.4%.\n\nMORE GOVERNMENT DEBT\n\nTrump also assured the public that his tax cuts would pay for themselves because of stronger growth. The cuts were broad but disproportionately favored corporations and those with extreme wealth.\n\nThe tax cuts signed into law in 2017 never fulfilled Trump\u2019s promises on deficit reduction.\n\nAccording to the Office of Management and Budget, the deficit worsened to $779 billion in 2018. The Congressional Budget Office had forecasted a deficit of $563 billion before the tax cuts, meaning the tax cuts increased borrowing by $216 billion that first year. In 2019, the deficit rose to $984 billion, nearly $300 billion more than what the CBO had forecast.\n\nThen the pandemic happened and with a flurry of government aid, the resulting deficit topped $3.1 trillion. That borrowing enabled the government to make direct payments to individuals and small businesses as the economy was in lockdown, often increasing bank accounts and making many feel better off even though the economy was in a recession.\n\nDeficits have also run high under Biden, as he signed into law a third round of pandemic aid and other initiatives to address climate change, build infrastructure and invest in U.S. manufacturing. His budget deficits: $2.8 trillion (2021), $1.38 trillion (2022) and $1.7 trillion (2023).\n\nThe CBO estimated in a report issued Wednesday that the extension of parts of Trump\u2019s tax cuts set to expire after 2025 would add another $4.6 trillion to the national debt through the year 2034.\n\nLOW INFLATION (BUT NOT ALWAYS FOR GOOD REASONS)\n\nInflation was much lower under Trump, never topping an annual rate of 2.4%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The annual rate reached as high as 8% in 2022 under Biden and is currently at 3.4%.\n\nThere were three big reasons why inflation was low during Trump\u2019s presidency: the legacy of the 2008 financial crisis, Federal Reserve actions and the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nTrump entered the White House with inflation already low, largely because of the slow recovery from the Great Recession, when financial markets collapsed and millions of people lost their homes to foreclosure.\n\nThe inflation rate barely averaged more than 1% during Obama\u2019s second term as the Fed struggled to push up growth. Still, the economy was expanding without overheating.\n\nBut in the first three years of Trump\u2019s presidency, inflation averaged 2.1%, roughly close to the Fed\u2019s target. Still, the Fed began to hike its own benchmark rate to keep inflation low at the central bank\u2019s own 2% target. Trump repeatedly criticized the Fed because he wanted to juice growth despite the risks of higher prices.\n\nThen the pandemic hit.\n\nInflation sank and the Fed slashed rates to sustain the economy during lockdowns.\n\nWhen Trump celebrates historically low mortgage rates, he\u2019s doing so because the economy was weakened by the pandemic. Similarly, gasoline prices fell below an average of $2 a gallon because no one was driving in April 2020 as the pandemic spread.\n\nFEWER JOBS\n\nThe United States lost 2.7 million jobs during Trump\u2019s presidency, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. If the pandemic months are excluded, he added 6.7 million jobs.\n\nBy contrast, 15.4 million jobs were added during Biden\u2019s presidency. That\u2019s 5.1 million more jobs than what the CBO forecasted he would add before his coronavirus relief and other policies became law \u2014 a sign of how much he boosted the labor market.\n\nBoth candidates have repeatedly promised to bring back factory jobs. Between 2017 and the middle of 2019, Trump added 461,000 manufacturing jobs. But the gains began to stall and then turned into layoffs during the pandemic, with the Republican posting a loss of 178,000 jobs.\n\nSo far, the U.S. economy has added 773,000 manufacturing jobs during Biden\u2019s presidency.",

        "text": "Marco Rubio says he would not accept 2024 election results \u2018if it\u2019s unfair\u2019\nThe Republican Florida senator Marco Rubio said on Sunday he would not commit to accepting the 2024 presidential election results, insisting that \u201cif it\u2019s unfair\u201d his party will \u201cgo to court and point out the fact that states are not following their own election laws\u201d.\n\nRubio\u2019s statements on Meet the Press come as he is considered among Donald Trump\u2019s top candidates for vice-president. The former president has continuously said falsely that the 2020 election was stolen.\n\nThose claims spurred the 6 January 2021 insurrection, during which participants stormed the Capitol building as lawmakers were in the midst of certifying the election results. Trump is facing a variety of charges related to alleged election meddling.\n\nWhen asked by host Kristen Welker: \u201cWill you accept the election results of 2024, no matter what happens, senator?\u201d Rubio replied: \u201cNo matter what happens? No.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s an unfair election, I think it\u2019s going to be contested \u2026 by either side.\u201d\n\nWelker kept pushing Rubio to answer whether he would contest the results \u201cno matter who wins\u201d.\n\n\u201cWell, I think you\u2019re asking the wrong person,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThe Democrats are the ones that have opposed every Republican victory since 2000, every single one.\u201d\n\nWelker repeatedly pointed out that Democrats who had issues with election results nevertheless conceded. Rubio, in turn, asked repeatedly whether Welker had asked Democrats this same question.\n\nRubio \u2013 who did certify the 2020 election results, and said on that day that \u201cdemocracy is held together by people\u2019s confidence in the election and their willingness to abide by its results\u201d \u2013 would not directly respond to whether Trump\u2019s unwillingness to accept election results served to undermine confidence in democracy.\n\nHe also refused to criticize Trump for his comments on Florida\u2019s six-week abortion ban, during which Trump called the law a \u201cterrible thing, a terrible mistake\u201d \u2013 despite also repeatedly claiming credit for overturning the federal protection for abortion.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes \u2014 Presidential Transition Free newsletter We will guide you through the aftermath of the US election and the transition to a Trump presidency Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We are not like the Democrats where, unless you are in favor of their bills that basically say, \u2018Let\u2019s just put in all this fancy language, but it\u2019s not meaningful in terms of any restrictions.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe played coy about whether he would agree to be Trump\u2019s running mate in the 2024 presidential election, saying he had not discussed the possibility with Trump, but adding: \u201cI think anyone who\u2019s offered that job, to serve this country in the second highest office, assuming everything else in your life makes sense at that moment, if you\u2019re interested in serving the country, it\u2019s an incredible place to serve.\u201d",

        "text": "An obscure provision of Ohio law could keep Biden off the ballot in November \u2022 Ohio Capital Journal\nPresident Joe Biden might not appear on the November 2024 presidential ballot in Ohio. Ohio law requires that presidential candidates be certified \u2013 that is, the state must be notified that presidential candidates have been officially nominated \u2013 90 days before the general election in order to get on the ballot. That is the earliest deadline of any state.\n\nBut the Democratic National Convention that will formally nominate Biden won\u2019t open until nearly two weeks after Ohio\u2019s Aug. 7 deadline. The Republican National Convention will wrap up nearly three weeks before the deadline, so Donald Trump won\u2019t have a problem getting on the ballot.\n\nThe 90-day deadline has often caused trouble since its adoption in 2010. Only in 2016 did both parties\u2019 conventions take place before the Ohio cutoff date. Both conventions took place after the deadline in 2012 and 2020, and legislators extended the deadline both times. This is the first time that only one convention comes too late, but Republicans could well be affected in the future.\n\nThere are ways to resolve this problem, as two other states with early deadlines have already done. Washington state officials said they will accept a provisional certification of Biden\u2019s nomination before the convention. And Alabama\u2019s Legislature shortened its deadline so that Biden could qualify for the ballot there.\n\nNeither solution seems likely in Ohio, where Republicans may be seeking to make life harder for the Democrats\u2019 presidential nominee. The attorney general says the state can\u2019t accept a provisional certification. And the Legislature couldn\u2019t come up with a timely fix to the law.\n\nOhio laws generally take effect 90 days after passage. So a change to the deadline had to pass by May 9, but the Legislature wound up doing nothing. Here\u2019s how that played out.\n\nDivided GOP controls Statehouse\n\nRepublicans have supermajorities in both houses of the Ohio Legislature, yet they couldn\u2019t agree on how to proceed.\n\nThe Ohio Senate passed a bill, but only after adding what Democrats viewed as a poison pill that would have banned foreign nationals from contributing to campaigns for or against ballot measures. Republicans objected to a Swiss national\u2019s rumored contributions to a successful campaign last year in which voters approved a reproductive-rights amendment to the state constitution.\n\nThe House had planned to consider a different proposal but never voted on anything before leaving town on May 8 for two weeks.\n\nThis reflects the Ohio GOP\u2019s bitter divisions. The House speaker won his position with support from only a minority of his caucus. The Senate president will switch to the House next year because of term limits and has hinted he will challenge the speaker.\n\nThe Legislature could still pass an emergency law to change the deadline, but emergency laws require a two-thirds vote in both houses. The chances of that happening are uncertain at best.\n\nSo, Democrats might have to file a lawsuit to get Biden on the ballot.\n\nWhat\u2019s the precedent?\n\nAs a constitutional law scholar, I believe Democrats would have a strong argument that using an arbitrary and unusually long deadline to bar a major-party presidential candidate violates voting and associational rights under the First and 14th amendments. But success is not guaranteed.\n\nSuch a lawsuit would rely on two U.S. Supreme Court cases that rejected state efforts to bar presidential candidates from the ballot.\n\nA 1983 decision struck down Ohio\u2019s old law that required independent candidates to qualify more than six months before the election. And a March 2024 ruling rejected Colorado\u2019s effort to exclude former President Donald Trump from its primary ballot.\n\nThose cases may be helpful in making the Democrats\u2019 case, but they don\u2019t dictate a win. The 1983 decision overturned a law that treated independent presidential candidates much less favorably than party candidates. Ohio\u2019s 90-day deadline treats all candidates the same.\n\nAnd the Colorado case involved the state\u2019s unilateral determination that Trump was ineligible for office as an insurrectionist under the 14th Amendment. Ohio\u2019s 90-day rule says nothing about whether a candidate is constitutionally disqualified.\n\n\u2018Nobody seems to know why\u2019\n\nThose differences might not matter. Even if they do, a lawsuit still could win.\n\nOhio\u2019s 90-day deadline is not only arbitrary, I believe that it is irrational. Nobody seems to know why the state extended the deadline from 60 to 90 days in 2010. The change came in an obscure provision of a 341-page bill.\n\nThe 90-day deadline has been a problem in almost every presidential election since then. The Legislature waived the deadline in 2012 and 2020, when both parties\u2019 conventions fell after the cutoff date, and those elections ran smoothly. So the state can\u2019t justify sticking with the 90-day rule this year when only one party is holding its convention after the deadline.\n\nBiden probably won\u2019t carry Ohio in any event. But having both major-party candidates on the ballot is necessary for a fair presidential election.\n\nEveryone involved keeps saying that Biden will appear on the November ballot. But, at least for now, the law says otherwise.\n\nJonathan Entin, Professor Emeritus of Law and Adjunct Professor of Political Science, Case Western Reserve University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

        "summary": " DHS warns of threats to election posed by artificial intelligence . New report says tools can be used to \"influence and sow discord\" in upcoming U.S. elections . The report was compiled by the Department of Homeland Security and obtained by ABC News .",
        "text": "DHS warns of threats to election posed by artificial intelligence\nThe threat posed by artificial intelligence programs is real and creates a serious challenge going into the 2024 election, according to a new federal assessment.\n\nThe analysis, compiled by the Department of Homeland Security and obtained by ABC News, outlines how, with less than six months before Election Day, next-generation technologies meant to fuel advancement also offer opportunities for misuse that could threaten the democratic system's bedrock of elections.\n\n\"As the 2024 election cycle progresses, generative AI tools likely provide both domestic and foreign threat actors with enhanced opportunities for interference by aggravating emergent events, disrupting election processes, or attacking election infrastructure,\" the May 17 document said. Those tools, the bulletin said, can be wielded to \"influence and sow discord\" in upcoming U.S. elections by those who view them as \"attractive\" and \"priority\" targets.\n\n\"This is not a problem for the future. This is a problem of today,\" said John Cohen, the former intelligence chief at the Department of Homeland Security, and now an ABC News contributor. \"Foreign and domestic threat actors have fully embraced the internet, and they are increasingly using advanced computing capabilities like artificial intelligence to conduct their illegal operations.\"\n\nAlready, those attempting to target elections have done so \"by conducting cyber-enabled hack-and-leak campaigns, voice spoofing, online disinformation campaigns, and threatening or plotting attacks against symbols of the US elections,\" the bulletin said.\n\nAnd now, the analysis warns, the innovative abilities of generative AI can be used against future elections.Those tools can be exploited \"to confuse or overwhelm voters and election staff to disrupt their duties\" by creating or sharing \"altered\" or deepfaked pictures, videos or audio clips \"regarding the details of Election Day, such as claiming that a polling station is closed or that polling times have changed, or to generate or promote other tailored false information online.\"\n\nIn this June 28, 2019, file photo the Department of Homeland Security seal is seen during a news conference in Washington. Carolyn Kaster/AP, FILE\n\nOn the eve of the New Hampshire primary in January, a robocall seeming to impersonate the voice of President Joe Biden circulated, encouraging recipients of the call to \"save your vote\" for the November general election, rather than participate in the state's primary, according to audio obtained at the time by ABC News.\n\nThat \"generative AI-created audio message\" was specifically flagged in the DHS analysis, which also noted \"the timing of election-specific AI-generated media can be just as critical as the content itself, as it may take time to counter-message or debunk the false content permeating online.\"\n\n\"This may be one of the most difficult elections for Americans to navigate finding ground truth in our lifetimes,\" said Elizabeth Neumann, a DHS assistant secretary during the first years of Donald Trump's presidency, and now an ABC News contributor. \"It's not just whether a politician is telling you the truth, but you won't even be able to trust your own eyes at the images you're seeing in your social media feeds, in your email and possibly even traditional media, if they don't do a good enough job vetting the material.\"\n\nThe 2024 race has been marked by increasingly toxic rhetoric, and the intermingling of inflammatory campaign trail hyperbole and courtroom theatrics, as Trump faces four criminal cases in which he maintains his innocence. Hate speech, misinformation and disinformation are running rampant on social media and in real life -- even as rapidly evolving technology remains vulnerable, experts said. Meanwhile, wars in the Middle East and Ukraine continue overseas, dividing Americans' views on foreign policy, with the conflicts rippling out in protests at major U.S. college campuses from coast to coast.\n\n\"Threat actors can attempt to exploit deepfake videos, audio content, or other generative AI media to amplify discontent,\" the DHS analysis said. \"A well-timed deepfake or piece of AI-generated media for a targeted audience could spur individuals to take action that may result in violence or physical disruptions directed toward the elections or candidates.\"\n\nThe threat landscape has grown \"more diverse and more complex,\" and protecting the integrity of U.S. elections faces more challenges than ever due to the accelerating sophistication of artificial intelligence, top intelligence officials told lawmakers last Wednesday.\n\n\"Using every tool we have is critical as the challenge is expanding,\" Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told a Senate committee holding a hearing focused on threats to the 2024 elections. \"There are an increasing number of foreign actors, including non-state entities who are looking to engage in election influence activities,\" she said, adding \"relevant emerging technologies, particularly generative AI and big data analytics, are increasing the threat by enabling the proliferation of influence actors who can conduct targeted campaigns.\"\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Avril Haines testifies before a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on worldwide threats, at Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., May 2, 2024. Craig Hudson/Reuters\n\n\"Innovations in AI have enabled foreign influence actors to produce seemingly authentic and tailored messaging more efficiently, at greater scale,\" Haines added. \"Even as the threat landscape is becoming increasingly complicated, it is my view that the U.S. government has never been better prepared to address the challenge,\" in part thanks to lessons learned from the 2016 presidential election.\n\nAuthorities at every level need to be ready to defend against artificial intelligence disseminating fake news at this delicate moment, experts said.\n\n\"One of the most important things we need to be doing now is educating and preparing the public. Because they will be the people who are being targeted with this content -- the public is the intended target -- and the objective is to influence how people behave,\" Cohen said.\n\n\"State and local officials need to have a plan, so that when this content is detected, they can use trusted sources of communication to counteract and correct inaccurate information. Once that content hits, it's going to spread across the online media ecosystem rapidly, and has to be counteracted immediately,\" Cohen added. \"Law enforcement and our security community have been slow to adapt to this rapidly evolving threat environment. We're still using the strategies of yesterday to deal with a threat of today. In a way, it's bringing a knife to a gunfight.\"",

Here\u2019s what happens next\nEditor\u2019s Note: A version of this story appears in CNN\u2019s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region\u2019s biggest stories. Sign up here.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nOnce seen as a likely successor to Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader, President Ebrahim Raisi has died in office, leaving the Islamic Republic\u2019s hardline establishment facing an uncertain future.\n\nAn ultraconservative president, 63-year-old Raisi was killed Sunday, along with Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and other high-ranking officials, in a helicopter crash in Iran\u2019s remote northwest. Their death comes at a delicate time for a country that faces unprecedented challenges at home and from abroad.\n\nThe Islamic Republic\u2019s economy remains crippled by American sanctions, its young population is becoming growingly restive, and the country faces increasingly belligerent adversaries in the Middle East and beyond.\n\nRaisi\u2019s death will \u201ctrigger elections at a time when the IRI (Islamic Republic of Iran) is at the nadir of its legitimacy and zenith of its exclusionary policies,\u201d Ali Vaez, Iran Project Director at the International Crisis Group think tank, said on X.\n\nHere\u2019s what comes next.\n\nIran's First Vice President Mohammad Mokhber speaks during Iran's government cabinet on Monday in Tehran, Iran. Iran's Presidency/WANA/Reuters\n\nWho steps in as president?\n\nPower has now been transferred to Mohammad Mokhber, who had served as Raisi\u2019s vice president and was on Monday approved as acting president by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the final arbiter of domestic and foreign affairs in the Islamic Republic.\n\nNot as well known as Raisi, Mokhber is \u201canother administrator,\u201d Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the Chatham House think tank in London, told CNN\u2019s Becky Anderson. \u201cHe is close to the IRGC, close to the levers of power,\u201d Vakil said, adding that he is likely to present a model of \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d in the coming days.\n\nBut the country must, by law, hold elections within the next 50 days. On Monday, Iranian state news IRNA said Iran\u2019s presidential elections will take place Friday, June 28. Candidates can register from May 30 to June 3, and campaigning will run from June 12 until the morning of June 27, it added.\n\nExperts say that the elections are likely to be hastily organized, with poor voter participation. In March, Iran recorded its lowest electoral turnout since the Islamic Republic\u2019s founding in 1979, despite government efforts to rally voters ahead of the ballot.\n\nThat vote \u2014 for seats in the parliament, or Majles, and the 88-member Assembly of Experts, which is tasked with picking the Supreme Leader \u2014 brought in mostly hardline politicians.\n\n\u201cThe population has by and large lost faith in the idea that change can come through the ballot box,\u201d Trita Parsi, co-founder and Executive Vice President of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft in Washington, DC, wrote Sunday on X.\n\nRescue team members work at the scene of the helicopter crash carrying Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in Varzaghan, in northwestern Iran on Monday. Azin Haghighi/Moj News Agency/AP\n\nThe March election also barred more moderate politicians from running \u2014 including former President Hassan Rouhani, once a regime stalwart \u2014 tightening the small circle of hardliners to continue the Supreme Leader\u2019s conservative rule after he dies.\n\n\u201cReal alternatives to Iran\u2019s hardliners have simply not been allowed to stand for office in the last few elections,\u201d Parsi said on X, adding that \u201cthose alternatives have in the eyes of the majority of the population lost credibility anyways, due to the failure to deliver change.\u201d\n\nUntil the Supreme Leader is replaced, however, little change is expected to follow Raisi\u2019s death, particularly on foreign policy.\n\n\u201cIt is really the Supreme Leader and the Revolutionary Guards who make the final decisions, and even in the region mostly implement Iran\u2019s regional policy,\u201d Vaez said, adding that \u201coverall we will see more continuity than change.\u201d\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN reporter details transition of power in Iran following fatal crash 01:07 - Source: CNN\n\nWhat are the longer-term implications of Raisi\u2019s death?\n\nRaisi\u2019s death has raised questions about who will eventually succeed Iran\u2019s 85-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the most powerful man in the country.\n\nThe Iranian clerical establishment had invested heavily in Raisi during his presidency, seeing him as a potential successor to Khamenei. Observers say he had been groomed to be elevated to the Supreme Leader\u2019s position.\n\nRaisi\u2019s death will create \u201ca succession crisis in Iran,\u201d Karim Sadjadpour, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, wrote on X.\n\nThe late president upheld some of the regime\u2019s most hardline policies, quashing the 2022 mass protests that sought to challenge repressive laws, such as the compulsory hijab.\n\nAccording to the constitution, the 88-member Assembly of Experts picks the successor to the Supreme Leader after his death. Members of the Assembly itself are, however, pre-vetted by Iran\u2019s Guardian Council, a powerful 12-member body charged with overseeing elections and legislation.\n\nThe Assembly of Experts has become increasingly hardline over the years. In the March vote, Raisi was re-elected to the assembly, and the Guardian Council barred Rouhani from contesting a seat.\n\nWhile there are procedures to selecting the Supreme Leader, discussions about successions are always \u201cvery opaque,\u201d Vakil said, adding that they take place \u201cwithin a very close circle of individuals.\u201d\n\nSome have pointed to the incumbent Supreme Leader\u2019s son Mojtaba Khamenei, a midlevel cleric, as a potential contender for the top post, but that would be a shift from the principles of the Islamic Republic, which overthrew a repressive monarchy in 1970 and has prided itself for shaking off hereditary rule.\n\nAllowing Mojtaba to replace his father may, however, spur theories that Raisi\u2019s death was not accidental, Sadjadpour said.\n\nRaisi\u2019s rivals are also likely to try to fill the vacuum he leaves, Vaez said.\n\n\u201c(This) definitely throws all the plans that offices of the Supreme Leader probably had out the window,\u201d Vaez told CNN\u2019s Paula Newton.\n\nHe added, however, that Iran has no shortage of political actors who are \u201csubservient and belong to the old guard of the Islamic Republic\u201d who can replace Raisi.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback What's next after the death of Iran's president? 03:56 - Source: CNN\n\nHow will it impact Iran\u2019s foreign relations?\n\nRaisi and Amir-Abdollahian oversaw a turnaround in Iran\u2019s relations with its Arab neighbors, helping normalized relations with longtime foe Saudi Arabia, with China\u2019s assistance. But they also saw the Islamic Republic initiate a large-scale direct attack on Israel for the first time, after a suspected Israeli attack on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria. That prompted Israel to launch an unprecedented retaliation, bringing the shadow war between the two nations out into the open.\n\nExperts say that Raisi\u2019s death is unlikely to have an impact on the regime\u2019s foreign policy, which is almost exclusively the domain of the Supreme Leader.\n\nIran\u2019s foreign policy is decided by the Supreme National Security Council and can be vetoed by the Supreme Leader, Mohammad Ali Shabani, Iran expert and editor of the Amwaj.media news outlet, told CNN\u2019s Anderson. \u201cWe will see continuity in terms of how Iran approaches the regional files, collaboration with regional allies.\u201d\n\nHe added that a similar trajectory is likely to be seen on the nuclear program.\n\nCould the upcoming presidential election bring change to Iran?\n\nSome experts say that the election presents an opportunity for the regime to bring back sidelined moderates. While Khamenei is likely to maintain conservative rule, he \u201chas always emphasized voter turnout as a litmus test of the legitimacy of the system,\u201d Shabani said. \u201cThat election can be a watershed moment for Iran.\u201d\n\nRaisi came to power in elections that many Iranians saw as a foregone conclusion. With moderate candidates squeezed out, voter turnout was extremely low, highlighting the regime\u2019s waning legitimacy.\n\n\u201cIf the Supreme Leader chooses to use these early elections as a watershed moment to open up the political space, to get people to vote again, that could be a massive gamechanger,\u201d Shabani said, adding that this would also impact succession to the Supreme Leader.\n\nWhat are the funeral plans?\n\nMulti-day funeral ceremonies for Raisi will begin on Tuesday in Tabriz and continue in Qom, Tehran and Mashhad, according to Mohsen Mansouri, the head of the funeral planning committee and and Iran\u2019s vice president of executive affairs.\n\nSpeaking to state television on Monday, Mansouri said funeral prayers will begin in the northwestern city of Tabriz at 9:30 a.m. local time on Tuesday. There will be a procession from the Tabriz Martyr\u2019s Square to the Tabriz Mosallah (prayer hall).\n\nLater on Tuesday, the bodies of the victims of the helicopter crash will be transferred to the holy Shiite city of Qom, where funeral prayers will take place at 4:30 p.m. local time (9 a.m. ET) outside the Fatima Masumeh Shrine. Afterwards, on Tuesday evening, the bodies will be transferred to Tehran\u2019s Grand Mosallah Mosque, according to Mansouri.\n\nOn Wednesday, large ceremonies are planned in Tehran at the Grand Mosallah. One or two other ceremonies will be announced later, according to Mansouri.\n\nOn Thursday morning, funeral prayers will begin in Birjand, South Khorasan province, where Raisi served as the Supreme Leader\u2019s representative. Later on Thursday, Raisi\u2019s body will be transferred to the Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad where Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei will conduct prayers over Raisi\u2019s body, according to Mehr news.\n\nOn Thursday night, Raisi\u2019s body will be buried in Mashhad, according to Mansouri.\n\nMansouri also announced the closure of offices on Wednesday all over the country, and said the governors in the provinces where processions will take place can declare public holidays on Wednesday.",

He is reported to have visited Russia, along with senior military and security officials, to discuss arms transfers.\n\nMokhber was on a list of individuals and entities sanctioned by the European Union in 2010 for alleged involvement in activities concerning Iran\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. Two years later, the bloc removed him from the list.\n\nUnlike other countries, Iran\u2019s first vice presidency is an appointed \u2013 not elected \u2013 position that assumed some of the powers of the prime minister after the position was abolished in 1989.\n\nThere are several appointed vice presidents serving concurrently in Iran, each taking on different aspects of executive affairs but operating mostly like a cabinet.\n\nMokhber\u2019s position was the top among vice presidents.\n\nHe was selected because he had a strong connection with the office of the supreme leader, like the late president himself, and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).\n\nHe was also seen as a man of action with longstanding experience in managing large-scale executive affairs.\n\nSetad\n\nBefore his appointment to the vice presidency, Mokhber served for 14 years as head of Iran\u2019s Setad, or the Organisation for the Execution of Imam Khomeini\u2019s Order.\n\nSetad is a highly powerful economic conglomerate established under Iran\u2019s first supreme leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, to focus on charitable affairs.\n\nIt is now believed to be worth tens of billions of dollars and remains under the direct control of the Iranian supreme leader.\n\nSetad and Mokhber were sanctioned by the United States in 2021, with the US Treasury claiming the organisation was involved in rights violations among other things, including violating \u201cthe rights of dissidents by confiscating land and property from opponents of the regime\u201d.\n\nMokhber was the head of Setad during the onset of COVID-19, at a time when Iran was hit by far the worst by the pandemic in the Middle East. Nearly 150,000 people died of COVID, according to official numbers \u2013 with actual numbers believed to be much higher.\n\nUnder his watch, Setad developed COVIran Barekat, the main coronavirus vaccine manufactured by the state.\n\nEarly life\n\nBorn in Dezful in the southwestern province of Khuzestan, the 68-year-old was educated in electrical engineering and also holds a PhD in international law.\n\nHe was active in banking and communications earlier in his career, having operated as the head of the Khuzestan Telecommunications Authority and then being promoted to deputy governor of the province in the 1990s.\n\nBefore moving up to the Setad, Mokhber was a deputy at another bonyad, the powerful Mostazafan Foundation which was also founded by Supreme Leader Khomeini as a charitable foundation.",

        "text": "The first Biden-Trump debate will be in Atlanta, a city rich with political drama\nAfter it appeared voters wouldn\u2019t get the chance to see the Democratic and Republican presidential candidates square off this year, President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump last week agreed to two debates.\n\nThe first debate will take place June 27 in Atlanta, Georgia. It\u2019s welcome news for the city of Atlanta, which was one of three finalists bidding to host the 2024 Democratic National Convention. It ultimately lost out to Chicago, but it wasn\u2019t for lack of political drama within the state.\n\nAtlanta became an epicenter of conspiracy theories and \u201celection fraud\u201d alleged by the Trump campaign during the 2020 election. Fulton County is now the site of the former president\u2019s election inference case. And the battleground state carries major electoral weight, having flipped blue for the first time in nearly 30 years during the last presidential election.\n\nThe location of the debate has history for Trump and will likely give him and Biden plenty to spar over.\n\nMore:Biden and Trump to debate in Atlanta, announces CNN\n\nTrump\u2019s history with Fulton County, Georgia\n\nIt\u2019s fitting that the debate will be held at CNN\u2019s studios, nestled in the center of Fulton County. The studios are less than a mile from the State Farm Arena, which served as a ballot processing site during the 2020 election.\n\nState Farm Arena quickly became the subject of conspiracy theories about illicit votes spread by Trump and his associates on social media in the hours following the election. Trump claimed that surveillance video showed election workers staying after hours and removing \u201csuitcases full of ballots\u201d from under a table.\n\nThe truth was much simpler. A plumbing issue at the arena had delayed Election Day operations, forcing some election workers to stay late to continue processing ballots. After a lengthy investigation by multiple agencies, it was determined that no fraud took place.\n\nThe Fulton County courthouse\n\nFormer President Trump is now intimately familiar with the Fulton County Courthouse, just half a mile from the site of the upcoming debate.After an investigation by the Fulton County District Attorney\u2019s Office, Trump became the first former president to be indicted on felony charges in Georgia. He and 18 allies were charged with trying to interfere with the 2020 presidential election in Georgia after pressuring state officials to overturn the results.\n\nProsecutors in Georgia proposed August 5 as a start date for the trial.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s potential as a swing state\n\nThe Georgia State Capitol, located a mile from the debate stage, played a significant role in the 2020 election.\n\nIt was where Biden was certified as the first Democrat to win Georgia in almost three decades, defeating Trump by nearly 12,000 votes.Georgia will remain a crucial swing state for the candidates in the 2024 election. Both Trump and Biden have made multiple stops to the Peach State during their reelection campaigns, showing just how important these votes are to the candidates.",
